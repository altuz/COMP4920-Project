If only we could do something about the shotguns one-shotting Zombies, it would be a wonderful game.I like the fact that clearly, the missions are meant to have some challenge to them; sacrificing individuals to kill stronger enemies, luring enemies out, using the arch-types effectively is a MUST.I also like the fact that the arch-types reanimate their foes, it's nice to know that when my Speed Zombie is cutting a swath of death through SWAT soldiers, it's fallen prey will revive and help continue the fight.I /LOVE/ the fact that the Humans retain their appearance they had when alive, as Zombies, rather than relying on a single model.However, I have a few problems with the game:AI: I dislike how the Zombies act like foolhardy lemmings and just all charge a nearby enemy without me saying so, it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to try and keep them from rushing out of cover and being mowed down accordingly, it's also a pain to get a large group through a door in a timely manner.Weapon Balancing: Shotguns are more powerful at range than Assault Rifles.

Instead of killing zombies you controll them witch is fun and you don't see many games that do this.Its in alpha but shows a lot of potential to become a great game. I'm hoping for new levels to come as soon as possible.Obviously there was some stuff that i didn't like. Such as the way the zombies behave. For example when you tell them to attack someone even tough they are getting their♥♥♥♥♥kicked they completely ignore the person thats tryng to kill them. So pretty much what you do in this game is to tell them where to go and they handle the rest. The heart beat when your chaos meter gets filled up is really loud and annoying... So on. I am writing these of the top of my head so i probably will froget about some of them.Played all the current levels. First 3 was a blast to play. Skirmish map however is really really hard.The last map is only for alpha players and it basicly lets you spawn any npc you want and just do as you please witch was the best map for me. I dont think there will be anything like a map editor/creator. At least i havent heard of it. If there is and i think there HAS TO BE a map editor. That would give the game so much replay value.So AI acts stupid sometimes. Both zombies and humans. Haven't come across any bugs. The existing levels are pretty good but there is room for improvement. Other than that this game is really fun to play and it has an idea that we don't see in games very often. I cant say you will like the game but i certinly love zombie games and this was one of the best i played as far as the gameplay goes...

If they keep this up, they will get a recommended review from me! Two more missions and some more content, not sure it was worth the wait but still this shows the developers still care about their game to some degree...OLDER UPDATE ON MY REVIEW:Interestingly enough, it does seem as if the developers are working on this. It isn't plainly obvious to everyone, but evidence is there. If you were to veiw the developer's posts, you will find that the developers are commenting on people's comments that question whether they are working on the game. The commenting on these questions are always along the lines of yes, they are working on the game. The developers have notably hinted that they have a community manager, and that this manager seems to have gone. So, this is supposedly the reason why we hear so little coverage on the progression of this game. Also, they hinted other complications such as some sort of problems with jobs and 'life intervening', as they say. They have stated that they are currently working on the next patch/update, but that it will take longer than expected by us, the gamers, and them, the developers. Still, though, I can't really recommend the game until I know for sure that the game is being worked (waiting for an update)...MY REVIEW:Do I reccomend this game? Well, in it's current state... it's a no from me and I think you'll find it's a no from- now quite a numerous amount of- other players.The game Undead Overlord pleasantly suprised me when I first played it back in 2014; upon first glance of the game I suppose it isn't difficult to mistake this for a really short, unresponsive, ugly, glitchy and really not fun to play game. I bought this game with an open mind, a mind open to the probability that this game is what could have been what I mentioned just before. I played the game and find out that the game ran smootly, apart from only a few apparent glitches and the occasional unresponsive zombie. Most of all, however, it was fun. The game looked, and still is, rough around the edges and has quite a bit of content that is not present yet (I say yet, but some things may never be added). Despite this, it was FUN.One thing I enjoyed was commanding the shambling, blood thirsty and brain hungry zombies to attack the puny human meatsacks which attempted to run away in fear or dared to stand in the mighty Overlord's way by trying to eliminate my increasingly growing horde. There were other aspects which I enjoyed also, such as sacrificing a percentage of my horde to create a bigger badass zombie and breaking the lid (doors) of a lunch box (building) to get to the delicious food inside (the tasty human flesh) and upon entering, indulged upon a free all zombies-can-eat buffet and left with a bigger horde and a fuller stomach. In all seriousness, I liked this game.Though however, this is ruined by the sheer lack of updates and and the fact that the developers seem to have abonded this game. This makes me concerned for the wellfare and playability of this game in future. A update hasn't been released since around Christmas, which is about over four months ago I think. If an update hasn't been released in four months, what honestly is the probability of this game being complete at all? The developers will have to pull some sort of miracle in order to complete this game, let alone repair it's reputation. The only thing I can hope for- that anyone could hope for- is that the game is due an absolutely giant update that will give players something to play for a long duration of time. Either that or the bigger stuff is only coming when the game is complete/released fully. In which case, the game would be more a demo than a game. But shouldn't a demo be free? But then again.. the don't the developers need money for development? Is this game really just a demo, but rendered a Early Access game so the developers can get money? There a few questions which can be asked about this game, but likely will not be answered.I'm not one to decide wether the developers should be or should not be working on the development of this game, but I think that they should work on this; this game seems unique and seems to be few of a kind. If they aren't working on the game, it would be common decency for them to announce this, rather than just take up and leave without and indication in the slightest. Also, maybe even a price reduction (if they already have enough money to develop this if development is still continuing). Maybe even an apology for quiting on the game, or opposed to this an anouncement that clearly states the game is being worked on. I believe that the game probably is being worked on; community silence doesn't mean they aren't working on the game.It kinda makes me angry how players are flaming over the fact that progress is taking too long, people need to realise developers have lives too. They are probably occupied with more important matters, or they could even be doing a really good update and are perfecting it as we speak. Still though, it is kinda likely that the game isn't being worked on.With that said, players do still need some sign that the game is being worked on, and some new content needs to arrive eventually. Only then can I and other players properly recommend this game. The game has, or had, a lot of potential, but unfortunately potential alone is not success or a deciding factor to buy a game. I personally think that it would be worth investing time and some money else where, in another Early Access game that you know for sure is being worked on."

Because of its sheer lack of content and effort from the devs I am giving the game a 4/10. If it was updated its an easy high score for me but because of the lack of content for a huge period of time and the fact the devs arent even giving us a single report explaining problems a day or two after it happens I cannot give it a high score the concept deserves.

It's not finished for one thing. A second key point that is worth mentioning is that it is not a game with femiliar gameplay. Both these 2 things are being said not in a negitive sense, not at all. They are just worth being noted before i go into what the game is.Undead Overlord, I saw this awhile back on Kickstarter. The concept of being the zombie-leader-commander was a very good hook, and still is. The game never made it to being fully funded. But now its been out for early access, which is cool. Gameplay is unique a bit clunky on a few things, but taking into account the game isn't finished yet should put some minds at ease for the time being. The game plays like a RTS but most of the time I feel like i'm always starting out with a infantry-flood tactic, which I suppose is to be expected (because you're zombies). All things considered, the game does show alot of promise, weather it can get rolling is up to funding and a whole lot of drive to see this through to the end."

Despite the concept here, the execution is rather lacklustre. This is an early access game, however I don't think this should relieve it of any criticism whatsoever and the really unfortunate thing is that this game is bad. the graphics are awful, dull and featureless, which is evident from the loading screen at the start, which isn't just ugly, it also looks incredibly stupid. The gameplay is entirely shallow, all you do is run around chasing civilians who run away (which is pretty frustrating) or run head on at armed forces until they die. There seems to be no strategic depth here at all, all the missions involve just killing everyone on the level, even the skirmish maps, which are slightly larger versions of the campaign map. This game is really disappointing, especially given the intended features are pretty sparse and patches are few and far between.

Not really worth buying at this stage, and it might not be worth buying at all.

The devs have not updated this game in a very long time with little to no communication with the players. I want my money back. My only regret is that Steam's new refund system came out after I bought this game, so it was too late to get myself a refund. DO NOT BUY.EDIT 2 -Jesus Christ they actually updated it a few months ago. But the update was the SMALLEST PIECE OF♥♥♥♥♥♥TO EVER. Especially because of the amount of time they had us wait (nearly under a year) for the next update, and the fact that it was a very small update just makes it all the more insulting. You'd expect that there'd be a large update after so much time with an apology, but no, it was a very small update. Now they've gone under the radar AGAIN.
