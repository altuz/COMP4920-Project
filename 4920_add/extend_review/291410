76561198006620592,Recommended,291410,29696800,Posted: 4 February,all,Ryltair,"When it comes to Duelyst, the comparison with Hearthstone is easily made. The way you earn cards is the same, the ranked system is the same, the mana system is the same and the way classes work is the same, complete with special power.However, there's a few very key differences between the two games that make Duelyst less random and, to me at least, more fun: The board on which you play as well as the ability to replace a card from your hand once per turn.The board in combination with the various cards makes for some really deep and satisfying tactical play that allows you to bend the game to your favour with smart decisions. Every turn the board looks different as there's so much going on and every turn has a very large amount of decisions that you can make. I really enjoy this the most as a fervent tactical turn-based gamer. If you like the combat in XCOM and Age of Wonders 3, you will find lots to love here.Other plusses are the quick matchmaking, the active developers, the gorgeous pixel art and animations and the large amount of interesting lore.I am personally not a fan of random stuff (which is why I stopped playing Hearthstone) and to me Duelyst strikes the perfect balance between randomness and tactics. Highly recommended!"

The strategy needed due to the infinite possibilities between the game board, placement of ""cards"", and of course the kick @$$ pixel graphics!!  A very satisfying game that could easily be played and enjoyed without spending a penny of ""real money"".  The daily quests (and free card) can get you enough gold to buy spirit orbs (card packs), gauntlet tickets (arena/draft play) and bloodborn orbs (card packs with cards you DONT have!).  Yes, if you get a crate you need a key to open it which costs $4.99.. BUT they did recently implement a ""common crate"" key reward for 15 quests completed in a month (easy).  However, if you are worried that you will be missing out on items due to not wanting to buy crates they are mostly filled with cosmetic items with 1 card here and there so they are not required to complete your card collection. The last thing I want to touch on, which is one of my favorites, is the fact that each ""faction"" or class does not only have 1 type of general that has the same hero power no matter the skin or avatar.  There are multiple general (main hero/""face"") options for each faction AND your general always has at least 2 attack and can  move around the board like a chess piece, the same as your minions, instead of just being your avatar with a set power that never moves or defends themself without a weapon equipped.To get the FULL experience and really find out I suggest you JUST PLAY IT.  Nothing to lose since it is F2P, the system requirements are low, and if you want to get a free spirit orb (or just 100 gold) use my referral code ""gdaddanyt"" and friend me to play some matches!! :)"

,Recommended,291410,30045331,Posted: 19 February,all,JJitter,"Duelyst is one of the best-designed games that I've played, and definitely the best card game.  The mixture of tactical depth and near-perfect balance among cards and factions is so satisfying, and I'm comparing to beautifully balanced games like Starcraft and DOTA.Pros:- The replace mechanic is amazing.  This is something that other card games are sorely lacking.  It gives you the option to replace one card in your hand each turn, which adds a lot to the skill ceiling and improves consistency of decks when players replace intelligently.- Game is on a grid so positioning matters.  I just hit S-rank for the first time (equivalent of ""Legend"" in Hearthstone) and I still feel like I make positioning errors in most games.  There is so much depth added from this; it is wonderful.- Counterplay Games is very proactive about balance.  If they feel that a card is too strong or weak, they change it quickly and re-evaluate.  This iterative approach is MUCH better than say, Hearthstone, where the devs refuse to change obviously broken cards for months until the screaming of anguished ladder players can be heard at Blizzard HQ.- The factions are unique and have interesting mechanics that reward good planning and decision making.  The asymmetric balance approach reminds me a lot of Starcraft, another beautiful strategy game (though obviously an RTS and not a card game).- The reward system (quests) are very generous (more than Hearthstone).  Epic/legendary drops are much more common even accounting for Duelyst allowing you to have 3x of each per deck.- Games are short and intense.- Client is well designed software-wise (netcode is good, very few crashes or surprise disconnections, client is highly responsive even on my $500 budget PC)- The tutorial system and solo challenges are great - my only complaint is that there aren't more challenges (I am spoiled)- They introduced weekly boss battles vs. AI which are lots of fun, and give a small free reward with an optional $5 larger paid reward.  This is Counterplay Games' way of covering continuing costs I believe; it's optional and you get to fight the boss either way, so I like the model.Cons:- Some people don't like the pixel art (though I personally like it)- A large portion, though not all, of the top-tier decks require quite a few epic and legendary cards.  HOWEVER, I personally hit Diamond in the first season (month) with a budget deck, and S-rank in second season after spending only $60.  I would hardly call that experience ""pay to win""; just be aware that you won't be able to play some of the top-tier netdecks in your first month or two unless you are willing to pay some money (and a couple specific decks are very expensive, though most expensive != best).  Personally I thought $60 for this game was reasonable.- The daily quests do take a decent chunk of time to complete (at least 45 minutes for me)- There are microtransactions for cosmetics and weekly value offers and stuff like that.  None of it is required at all, but the very concept makes some people angry, so beware if you are one of those people."
76561198030554225,Not Recommended,291410,29918203,Posted: 14 February,all,ArgentumEmperio,"I played the game through the Duelyst Launcher since its inital release and there's two aspects that is important to note:The GAME is possibly one of the best games I have ever played! But the developers, buisness model and new player experience is horrendous!I will state three things to back up this claim of mine:1. When Duelyst launched the game had a good deal where you paid like 7.50€ for 15 packs or more or something like that and it was a good deal at the time but... a few months later they had an event in which you could get something like 20 free packs! Amazing right?Well... it was time based. And not that it was for a limited amount of time but if your account was older than a month I believe it was, then you weren't eligable for these packs. To summarize it in a very clear cut way: it was more economically viable for you to just ignore your old account if you didn't have many cards on it or had put it down for an extended period of time after you had bought the release-bundle or just didn't play much on the account and didn't have it. It made more sense to ignore your account and make a new one.This alongside the absolutely insanely noob unfriendly quest system and that if you do well at a certain rank you can get locked to either Silver, Gold or Platinum rank and... Noobs belong in Bronze and Silver. Good players who have so called 'Battle Ribbons' that showcase they have won 100 ranked games with a faction show up in Gold. And usually you see people with 5-10 Ribbons if not even more at Gold. Where as you might see ONE Player with ONE Ribbon in Silver.You can get locked to gold and have to battle with these players and to complete a quest you need to do the following:a) Play a set number of minionsb) Play a set number of cards (yes, these two are different)c) Play a set number of turns into the game (conceding or taking lethal damage does not lower this requirement)Basically this means that if you are a new player or someone who just simply is not good enough ... in order to build a collection you have to be willing to just get slugged and unrelentlessly beaten down by people that just JUMP in terms of skill by a SIGNIFICANT margin!(Also you get gold after every win and every 3 win you get more gold but once again, you need to win to get this or be prepared to be beaten into a pulp if you are trying to complete quests.)2. Duelyst makes good use of that its a digital cardgame when dealing with mechanics and in-game by allowing you to essentially conjure up cards by having interesting effects that just add cards to your hand.However... from the buisness side, it is NOT understanding of the digital implications of a modern video game because the pricing of the individual packs (not gold price but that's already horrendous to try to get any amount of as I pointed out already) is insanely high! Since you need a playset of 3 cards of basically most cards in the game, you need to get a HUGE amount of cards! And the prices in regards to paying with actual money as opposed to gold is insanely high when you consider how many packs of cards you need to get from the base set and the expansion!If you are good at the Gauntlet you can mitigate some of these issues but... I will go into why this is not really the case because...3. The developers haven't made a casual mode or non-ranked place to play.Its either the Gauntlet or Ranked Ladder in regards to where you can play and complete quests. The gauntlet functions much like the same when compared to Hearthstone but ... the gold is once again, annoying beyond belief to get ANY amount of!And since there's no casual mode where non-competitive decks exists, you consistently have to try to complete the quests whilst playing against people with litterally thousands of games played, near complete if not complete collections of cards and since the playerbase is still relatively small for the game you basically ONLY encounter excellent-to-amazingly good players once you have gotten past Silver which can happen by mistake and you are now stuck in Gold.The game itself is AMAZING! So if you can get past that the buisness model is that of a regular cardgame in a digital format, that the developers genuinely do try to scam their players' accounts and the most horrendous F2P-system bar that of something like Magic Duels. Its not a Mobile-Phone level of ""F2P""-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but it is certainly horrendous and really, REALLY annoying for folks that doesn't want to put in 40-50€ into the game to even just get STARTED.I recommend the game if you are like me and have a cardgame-itch you need to scratch and you want another option than Hearthstone. But to anyone else who's basically not a cardgame-addict... AVOID THIS GAME!!!Oh and a few more things since I am posting this review only here on Steam:1. The fanbase is rabidly trying to defend the game because they are no longer victims of the horrendous new-player experience this game offers.2. The Steam version doesn't seem to have a working Steam-Overlay system so what's even the point of having it on Steam I don't know.3. It got essentially CS:GO lootboxes in the game so... yah', it tries to scam you in that regard as well being a Gambling-Simulator.4. Both Steam and non-Steam versions of the game can crash or just freeze up if you try to look through your collection quickly if you play in Windowed mode.5. The best way to summarize the community when asking for help is ""I don't believe you"" if you are experiencing something other angelic song when playing the game (they don't deal well with neither reality NOR with critique)."

I adore the fantasy setting and the lore is amazing! I've only read and unlocked a few of them but they are really good. Being an avid fan of fantasy novels I absolutely love these kind of things and also because I'm the type of gamer that reads everything in a game. LOL.If you're a fan of card games and/or strategy FF Tactics type of games then I would definitely recommend this game!

Game is fequently updated and there is ton of cards. Each time I play it gets intense and I never feel bs p2w or anything like it. I have bought one booster pack for 5$ (less than I have spent on arenas in HS :D ) and right now I have 2 full competetive decs and I land in diamond divisin each seassson while playing couple mathes not even daily so I think this is a very balanced business model in Duelyst.You like HS or other card games but u wan to check what happens when you mix board in it?

76561198084615317,Recommended,291410,29966417,Posted: 16 February,all,Oh God Help Me,"So I recently got myself into card games, it all started from Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Links on my phone, it was fun checking/collecting cards, winning duels, losing duels, creating personal decks or you can copy/innovate from those who post their decks online. But then some things just annoyed me in game; you can only summon 3 monsters and use 3 spell/trap cards,then there's the constant blabbering betwen the 2 characters before and after every duel, also the duel is locked in potrait and you can't change it to landscape, plus the menu has so much of everything(I guess).Next, I tried Hearthstone, it has a nice, slick, easy-to-read UI, nothing too fancy but the decks are hard to earn, you need real dedication to get new packs which I lack.Then I suddenly stumbled myself onto this beauty, it has a simple, readable UI, fairly earned packs, different characters have their unique ablilities and cards (not just a single card), really well done pixel art and splash art for each characters, so far a balanced gameplay for each character and last but not least the beautiful art of the menu background and each boards that you come acrossI really highly recommnd this game who're interested in card games, great stuff"

Legend in Hearthstone, Rank 1 in Elder Scroll Legends, Diamond in Eternal; and despite how fun some of those games were, none of them have matched Duelyst for me.Duelyst is probably the most visually attractive of any of the current online card games, and, at a glance, has one of the better UIs (which, if you've been playing online card games like I have, you'll recognize as a rarity for the genre.)I will note, I haven't been good at Duelyst (or even really played it) for around a year, so I don't feel comfortable commenting on balance. When I was heavy into it however (S Rank for a couple seasons) it was reasonably well balanced compared to other offerings of the genre, and well supported by the developer.Additionally the grind isn't as bad as Hearthstone (in my opinion, anyways), nor is it as dull as Eternal's endless march of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ commons before you get to anything useful.All in all, I would say Duelyst is one of the best, if not the best online card games out there right now."

Duelyst requires more skills to play as compared to most of the other card games, as players who required to kite their enemies strategcally to avoid being caught up, etc. However it would be even better to have more interactive skills, such as the ability to camouflage or u can choose to use your minions to guard an direct attack for u (rather than just having the ability to provoke enemy)."

The developers have continued to change the game rewards, the expansion decks, and now the boss battles. While it is definitely skewed for the players that pay (what ""free"" card game isn't?), I have yet to pay a cent and I still think I do pretty well in the game. The cards are often revised based on community reviews which is great and shows a genuine care from the developers. I highly recommend for people that are fans of chess and/or magic the gathering. I like the visual look of the game with the pixel characters among an almost watercolor background. If you want to waste some hours for free, definitely try this one."

76561198005488263,Recommended,291410,29637810,Posted: 1 February,all,Phill,"As both a turn-based strategist and card game lover Duelyst really does fuse both of these elements together in an extremely enjoyable fashion.Duelyst is a card game with a twist - instead of your monsters lining up akin to a game of dodgeball, Played on a 9 by 5 board the object (like most card games) is to reduce your opposing general's health to zero. However instead of just being a number, your general is a monster on the board, capable of moving and attacking (they begin with an attack value, something other card games don't offer).Starting play begins with you drawing 5 cards, and the option to exchange 2 of them immediately. The player going first begins with 2 mana crystals while the player going second begins with 3 (maximum of 9). You may play as many cards per turn as you can afford, as well as exchange 1 card per turn in an effort to find what you need.Cards are split into 3 types: Monsters, who are summoned next to either your general or another monster (so positional play is very important), Spells and Artifacts (items you equip to your general, up to a maximum of 3, that can be destroyed once your general is damaged 3 times while wearing it). You only play cards on your opponents turn, and card drawing is done at the end of the turn allowing you to strategise and plan your next turn more effectively.There are 8 factions, all who contain 2 different general options, that have differing playstyles depending on if you wish to brute force your opponent with creatures (Magmar) or sneakily sap their life force away (Songhai).The main reason I feel the game is excellent is the ability to exchange cards, both initial hand and each turn) as well as the grid allowing for a more in-depth strategy meaning a single misplaced monster at the wrong time will ruin your whole game!"

I love puzzles, and this game has card puzzles, and they are pretty cool.So... why dont I recommend it? simple: like most collectible card games its nature is... 100% pay to win. The strategy side kind of balances things out at first, but not enough in my opinion. Also the way it tries to sell you things is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥, I dont mind buying card packs but why are there limited time cardpacks? why are there free boxes that require premium keys to unlock? why do you give them to me and then tell me that if I dont buy the key in 48 hours it dissapears?Also, besides rare cards that have incredible value, the balance between factions and even between leaders of the same faction leaves a little to be desired, but I cant hold that much against it.TL;DR: This is a fun game and I WOULD recommend you to try it out, but I dont recommend giving it a penny in its current state"

I understand they need to make money, and I intended to pick up a few packs/orbs, I did buy the full expansion set. I'm fine with selling packs, emotes, skins all that stuff, but what I can't deal with is the key system. Basically giving you half the prize is nothing but a carrot on a stick and I find it distasteful. I recently uninstalled Paragon for the exact same reason. However I feel it's worse here as my friend opened up prismatic (shiny) cards from these chests, it's not just cosmetics.Like I said though, there is a great game here. If the key thing doesn't bother you then go for it. I half wish I wasn't so put off by the practice, but for myself personally, I can not recommend a game using this system."

,Recommended,291410,29493684,Posted: 25 January,all,Sir Percedal of Sadlygrove,"My First Impression - This game is a game that is unlike any other game that is like this game, this game... this... beautiful game... (start epic music) is a game that is a good game because its a game were you play a game were you need to use tactics to beat the games in the game, therfore winning the game. Seriously though, this *game* is a card game but it isnt only that, you need to actually think about what your next turn is and if youre lucky, you may level up and get more cards that'll buff up your strategy. I've only been playing for three hours right now and i must say that the character design is great, I especially like that in battle, the characters and minions (summon with cards) are pixelated (not because of bad graphics though). Right now ive beaten the first boss and got the boss crate, but you need a key to open it which costs $4.99 (my first complaint) I think that the devs should calm down on the cost for items. But overall, one of the best (and maybe only) card games i have played, 9.5/10."

76561198026217948,Recommended,291410,29597026,Posted: 30 January,all,Mr. Meeseeks,"Wow, where to start with this game. First off it's one of the best strategy collectible card games I've played in the last couple of years, and I've done my duty to properly vet all the ones that come out. As an ex PoxNora player I was particularly attracted to the use of a board and the skill that goes into any game using those features, on top of that the game is very fast paced, with my quickest match ending in a win within three minutes and my longest being only ten minutes long!Like any collectible card game you may get the thought that it is very ""pay to win"" at first, I sure did when I watched a couple S-Rank matches and saw the use of legendary/epic rarity cards to be extremely heavy. But the use of the crafting system quickly allowed me to almost mimic some of the top tier decks I observed within TWO days of playing, by disenchanting legendary cards I got from factions I didn't play I was quickly able to obtain rare and legendary cards that directly aided in my main decks win condition.After playing for only two days (6 hours) I have come to the conclusion this is the game I've been waiting for. Heck sometimes I can manage to pull off a win using only faction leveling cards (free cards given just for practicing and leveling a faction before jumping into ranked) and common cards, this is very rare in any card game nowadays, just because I use strategy and unit placement that the use of a board gives.If you've been waiting for a gem of a collectible card game that can be more fun than even Hearthstone, MTG, or Shadowverse.

I really can't understand people complaining about that Duelyst is pay-2-win game. It's one if not the most f2p friendly game. I know people reached S-rank (the highest rank) without spending any real money. I read a review complaning about the Key and Chest system. Seriously, I've been reaching Diamond and S-rank every season and didn't buy a single key. It mostly contains Cosmatics which will never give you a slight advatage."
,Recommended,291410,29947043,Posted: 15 February,all,Fredzillasaurus,My favorite card game after Shadowverse. Definitely the best in the tactical card game subgenre. Action is fast paced and complex but card collecting/crafting is somewhat tedious compared to Shadowverse and Faeria.

76561198359079728,Recommended,291410,29719925,Posted: 5 February,all,bowl_OF_flakes,"The first game I got on Steam, it may as well be my first review, too....Deulyst is a strategic CCG that doesn't disappoint with its Hearthstone-ish card/crafting system as well as a chessboard-style play field for an extra strategic wrinkle for those tiring of the CCG standard. Monetization feels somewhat expensive. Longer-term free players may feel some P2W oppression, but hopefully not too much as a legendary is rewarded for each faction by grinding your way through, about 8-12 hrs, times 6 factions. Pixelated graphics serve the game nicely and are animated quite well. Monthly ladders and a gauntlet mode demand competitive online play as well as a single player practice mode and a win in 1 turn challange mode to prep for said online pvp. A minor gripe about the monetization is the chest/ key system. I fully expected a simple timelock here, and instead was met with a paywall where your 'lucky draw/ reward' is another ask for payment. They are just cosmetic things, its just kinda crappy seeing this inventory of crates growing, knowing its 2-10 dollars to open one. All in all its entertaining, and competent free players can compete."
,Recommended,291410,29681823,Posted: 3 February,all,Acksu,"Been playing casually and I have enjoyed it so far. Not p2w imo. The game rewards for time invested with cards, but you can buy them too; it doesn't make it p2w. Some ""bronze"" decks can carry tou to Gold easily if you know how to play."
76561198046108341,Recommended,291410,29648237,Posted: 2 February,all,Jacked2TheMax,Duelyst while having elements of Hearthstone and other Card Games brings something quite fresh with it's battlefield and generals system. The quests are rewarding enough that you can aqquire new cards with relative ease. The graphics may seem a bit dodgy at first impression but there is a suprising amount of animation put into spell and death effects.Overall the fact that it's a Free To Play and has a Small Download Size should entice even the most die hard Hearthstone fans to try it out and see what it has to offer.
