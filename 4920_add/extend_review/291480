,Not Recommended,291480,29576954,Posted: 29 January,all,BigRig,"With shy of 1,900 hours into the game or about 79 days put into the game I feel like it's time to un cover the real Warface and what this game truly is.To start off I started playing Warface back in August 28 of 2013 on the Xbox 360. I instantly became hooked and met some of the most out going people on there. At one point, people were sending extra controllers to eachother because controllers were breaking from playing so much. December 3, 2014 Xbox 360 Warface was shutdown after people put hundreds of dollars into the game. Being a huge let down to all of us dedicated players, some of us moved onto the pc version. Some stayed some didn't (Most people didn't) I was one of the ones who stayed. The point i'm trying to make is I am as loyal as loyal could get to this game. But do you think any of the devs listen to what needs to be fixed and what needs to be balanced? nope. Instead after 1,900 hours and 200$ being put into my Warface account I receive a faulty ban. Why would I risk all of my money and time? I would'nt. Instead of banning the people using vpns or hacking, they ban someone who supports them. I must say, my best moments in Warface are not because of the game, it's because of the people I play with. 1.5% of the community are loving and caring people that just want to play the game. The rest are people that don't belong on the NA server and speak spanish, russian, or some other language or people who just want ruin your day. Stay away from this game at all cost. Bad devs, bad servers, bad community."

The only thing in this game that doesnt offer you a micro transaction is the uninstall button.UPDATE: In order to successfully migrate your account, you must install the gface launcher, start it and sign into it, then after u sign in go to steam and start it from the library. Then on gface launcher migrate the account with them both open (my.cm and gface) and it should work okay. They shouldve just migrated them automatically honestly, it is stupid to have to do all that.

76561198237999658,Not Recommended,291480,29698007,Posted: 4 February,all,RedGhost5,"Oh Warface, now this is a topic I do not enoy. I have been a long player to Warface, longer than the 500 hours on my account. I used to love this game just because it was free to play and I could play it with all my friends. I enjoyed the hell outta it. I thought it was such a fun game and so much better with friends. But that's about it, if you don't have friends this game is god awful. This game's community is honestly cancer where majority of it comes from like Russia or Spanish speaking countries. It has an insane amount of hackers and this new Fair fight system has helped that, but trust me it doesn't help much. This Fair Fight system can get you removed/banned for just being good. Also, this being a free to play game is actually free. But have fun buying anything new or better with the way the game is set up. First of all you have to buy all your money with Cash, and suprise getting cash in this game takes forever. Think of it like this, a good item goes for like 15,000, you make about 200, for a 10 minute game. On top of that there is this repair system for your items, which suprise, requires you to pay money to fix your items, which can be quite costly when you finally saved up for that Warlord item that costs a ton to repair. So after repairs you make like what, 70-100 cash? It's stupid. AND on top of that, to buy an item, like a gun, it costs an absurd amount, ranging around 40,000. And if you don't have that kind of money, you can ""rent"" the weapon for a day for like what, 2000-3000 cash? For a single day, which isn't exactly a lot and costs a ton. Also they have this way of getting items called Random Boxes, just look up a video of a Warface youtuber opening this dumb things. They blow like 100,000 Cash and not even get the good weapon outta the box. And take a guess how much some of them spent for that video unless they're sponsored. I'll tell ya right now, it's around that $100 range. I'm not even done yet, remember how I said that fairfight thing that bans cheaters. Well guess what it's awful, when it first came out it was amazing, but now it just doesn't seem to work. My friend, who in my opinion is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for putting like $4000 FREAKING DOLLARS into the game, has been banned from TWO different accounts. I do not know why he still plays the account after all the crap he's gone through, but the devs don't even care. He emailed them that he got banned for no reason and they just reply, ""Fairfight says otherwise."" He has put so much money into this game and so much time, nearly triple mine and still goes through this games crap. The reason I quit is because I got hacked and guess what, they're doing nothing about it. I don't have that kind of money to waste on a stupid game like he does, but when I lose nearly 1,000 hours of work which I repeat was all played freely, I give up on this stupid game and this stupid company. That's all I have to say and please for your well-being stay away from this awful game and even worse community."

People were just running around and no team work what so ever - maybe I am just blind, coming from support - medic.Combat - was ok. Few cool moves, such as slide attack, climbing with help of a teammate - which don't see from f2p fpsmmo's usually.Shop system is way too expencive. It has quite cool weapons and costumization items but getting them can be pain in the... Either you have to grind a lot to get a weapon for few days or use money.Achievements are not triggered in steam, which is little upsetting - since I am a fellow achievement hunter.Anyway, I dont really recommend the game.

,Not Recommended,291480,30052134,Posted: 19 February,all,WildSyde,"It's a shame what they did to this game. Like many people, I started playing warface on the Xbox 360 back in 2014. The game was an absolute joy to play despite the pay to win nature of it. Honestly, Warface on Xbox 360 was everything that Call of Duty should have been. Fun multiplayer PvP games types AND co-op PvE missions that required tons of strategy and communication with your teammates. Unfortunately, after being live for less than a year, Crytek shutdown Warface Xbox 360 in December of 2014.So, after the Xbox 360 version closed down, I, like many players who enjoyed the game, switched over to the PC version. Unlike the Xbox 360 version, the PC version is a complete mess. Firstly, the game on both Xbox 360 and PC used to have a CoD Modern Warfare vibe, taking place in modern times with modern weapons (yes there were a couple of not terribly modern bosses in the PvE missions, like a giant mech suit, but the asthetic was nice.) Then, everything for lack of a better term went to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Firstly, they migrated the game tomy.com, which wiped every single player's account. They also updated the game to be more like the more recent CoD games that everyone hates (you know, those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ future ones that try to hard to be halo? Yeah, those ones) They added some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ knockoff of CoD zombies, and finally, they started to not only not ban hackers, but actually ban completely legit players for no reason and then completely refuse to listen to any arguments regarding their broken anti-hack system.So, over all, if it was back 3 years ago, I would absoultely whole-heartedly give this game a thumbs up and suggest that everyone who enjoy's tactical shooters play it.But at it's current point... don't even bother to install it, it's a waste of hard drive space due to the fact that it went the same way as most other games like it on steam do, they start off good and then the devs single-handedly manage to run it into the ground."

When the new update came out, and the game download was something like 8gb, (when it used to be 2gb for update) which took, with my internet speed about 4 hours (and if I remeber right, 8 gb was the download size when i've installed the game fresh, for the first time, from scratch! ).I read the migration guide for steam user(NOTE: Nothing described in that guide happened...) and then I've clicked on the play button of steam and i've installed the new launcher. Why i have to do it manually? when EVERY  other games on steam that i've played so far gets installed when downloaded? But wasn't that what get me upset (I will cover about that in a bit... or maybe at the end of a wall-text story...). FINALLY the launcher starts... and the launcher starts downloading 40mb. Again i've have to ask: WHY? I've just download 8gb why I have to download other stuff?! And again, that wasn't what make me so angry to write a negative review. I take a look in the top right corner and I see my nickname and I think"" Well, at least the migration process was quick"" and then I hit the green play button and the launcher ask for my my e-mail ""...oh well still quick"" i think, i write my email and the game starts. Without even let me see a game menu, and so not even letting me adjust any controls and graphic settings, which I was 100% sure were screwed up by the update (and I was right...) the game throws me into the assault class tutorial. And my stupid positivist brain starts to think:""Umh... thats weird! I've almost 60 hours in the game why am i forced to do this tutorial again? Maybe they added some new features..."" and so i press ""ESC"" on my keyboard, I adjust the settings and then quickly complete the assault and sniper tutorial, without even letting the guide voice finish a single explanation and... nothing new was added.In the few moments that my PC took to load the menu i've thinked ""Why i've wasted my time doing that tutorial?Oh well! At least i've earned a gun for a few d..."" then my inventory loads ""ays... WHERE ARE ALL MY GUNS!? MY MONEY!? MY ATTACHMENT?! AND WHAT IN HELL IS  DOING _*INSERT HERE NUMBERS THAT I DON'T REMEBER* (something like _0294829)WHERE IT SHOULD BE MY ACCOUNT NAME AND LEVEL?""So, all my progress so far? GONE! All my money? GONE! All my stats? GONE! I can't even play the medic which i used to play with the 19000 credits piledriver shotgun... Becouse not only my progress are gone (so no Piledriver...) but i can't  even play the medic class as it's locked!

As someone who spent zero dollars on the game maybe I don't get to complain but the requirement to install the steam/origin/uplay like""my.comlauncher"" for just this game is super annoying. Combine that with not being able to migrate my account and the fact that I prefer the loadout style classes in this game to the CS:GO buy your weapon every match style isn't enough to keep me playing anymore.TL,DR = R.I.P.

And now it is like necessary to pay, to stay competetive. I mean, just to enjoy the game. F2Players will get nowhere within a reasonable time. You will be farmed in PvP, you will be dying a lot in PvE, your repair costs will be more than you earn. - For the average players. You will have to quit your job and divorce to play enough to unlock highest tier weapons.. Even when you pull all out, you will face disconnects. You wont be able to re-join the match. You will most likely experience latency issues randomly.Other cons:- if your team is bad, you can't carry in most game modes- no medic in team is a waste of time 90% of times in co-op- community is not that helpful- expensive RNG boxes- P2Play content is added, and they will probably will continue adding more- unprofessional supportPro:- active development- lof of game modes- progression system- runs on lower end hardwares- daily rewardsThe main reason I can't recommend the game is:You can't really enjoy what it has to offer without paying.It was just a quick collection of info, feel free to comment."

Many people ehad issues with game launch. After the game was handed over to new developers it has gone through the roof. I've played 6 /12 hours of this game and can confidently say that it's good. For a free game that holds it relevance to COD, or BattleField it's amazing.Pros:-Amazing graphics with multiple options for all types of systems 4/5-Multiplayer is great, always finding a match 4/5-Multiple guns to choose from with a range of attachments 5/5-Requiring a medium internet speed 4/5TOTAL 17/20Cons:-People being a much higher level than you or having better guns 2/5-Some maps have a ""blindness affect"" which with the right timing can turn the scores around 3/5-some guns take ages to unlock, same goes for attachments 2/5-No language filter for those whom don't like explicit language 0/5TOTAL 7/20ALL OVER 24/30Conclusion:So overall Watface is a good game and I highly recommend it, enjoy.:Credits to Wolffy, BattleCatz and 010Dogz010 For Helping Write The Review:"

Warframe was a good game to waste time on for about 4 months for me....but i honestly think the devs need someone with an imagination to fix the repetition problem."

76561198027159899,Recommended,291480,29579757,Posted: 29 January,all,The_Pruple_Fox1,Its a well made game the only drawbacks I have found are that its heavy with spawn campers. I havent been able to leave my spawn without someone shooting me. Another drawback is that the steam version is unstable. I played 3 or 4 matches before I crashed. I could not start the game again after I waited about a day before trying again and I still couldnt get in. This was however fix by downloading it from their websight. Another drawback is that you have to be rank 13 before you can play with your friends who are rank 13 and above. This was done in an atempt to minimise hackers and to keep new players from getting rekt by veterin players. All in all it is a good FTP game.

I first joined the European servers, reason being, on other games,  I didnt get any lag nor did i get kicked for low latency. My only problem is that this game kicks me off every single TDM, for example, because of my internet connection. Both North American and European servers have really bad connectivity. Other than that....THE GAME IS BRILLIANT.But please release an update that sorts the server problem out. I would really like to play this game for the purposes of making videos for my Youtube channel.P.S. It isnt only me that has this problem. I saw on the Player list whilst holding in TAB that all the players had 1 bar or less on their ping. It really makes the game unenjoyable.The mechanics of the game are brilliant, using teamwork to complete objectives. Running, jumping and the whole ""bang-shoot"" all require stamina. which is a first for me in an online game. BUT THE IDEA IS BRILLIANT. I personally believe this game has so much potential and by the looks of things, this game, already having really great graphics, gameplay mechanics and an awesome selection of weapons and armour upgrades...It could just as well be on the same level as COD and Medal of Honour. I am yet to play the game on many of its many other game modes and I personally cannot wait to see where this game goes in the future.In saying that,IT CAN ONLY GO UP!Thank you very much :)"

Yet after playing the PVP modes, I quickly discovered the servers to be filled with rampant cheaters and abusers. In a single game, the enemy team had four bots all armed with the same shotgun that kept sliding around the map one shotting every thing. And no, I'm not salty that we lost and are coming up with excuses, unless you know four pals with names like u_008012049, u_008012050, and the worst offender of ALL; u_008012048! And speaking of the sliding mechanic, I think it's kind of sh*t. Maybe it would make sense in a futuristic shooter with jump-packs, but Warface doesn't pull it off well, and the game is full of standard military dudes, who have somehow gained the ability to teleport themselves five feet in any direction by crouching!"

,Not Recommended,291480,29963596,Posted: 16 February,all,"Dark Assassin, Link™","This game is fun, really fun actually because of all the things you can do in it... Saddly it doesnt give you enough freedom. In order to play a regular mission that isnt against other players you have to have a squad of ur own. which if you have no friends will be impossible for you. And in order to do the Insane Marathon missions (OMG SO DAUM HARD) You would need to group up with people who know what they are doing. Which is good int he sense of... People from columbia play an US servers for some reason...How the game runs and its mechanics are pretty awesome. Id say its in between the BS of CSGO's toxicity and COD's Saltiness. So its a heavily teambased F2P Pay2Win game in its self. where as you can grind the same BlackShark mission over and over and keep on losing untill you finaly win!... and get a weapon that you have for 3 hours before it expires. It has an ingame store so you can basically see about 75% of the guns in the game ever in it. Or goto the auctionhouse that is now down forever essentially and try buying a gun fromt here with REAL CASH.Its hit marker system is pretty good, 1/10 bullets will pass through ur enemy without damaging them or tracking it as a damage. So look forward to that time where your team needs you to clutch the game as you Shoot a sniper round into the enemy who is currently 1 second away from defusing the bomb. Now ladies and gentlemen... Lets, Spin the ""Wheel of Fortune!!!"" Theres a percentage chance that the bullet u fired will either pass through the enemy or not even seem to hit close to them at all because you were in midair scoped in with the sniper zoomed in on hsi head! What you say? ""Jumping doesnt effect zoomed in guns?"" Well thats... absolutely right!Currently the games hit tracking is actually Amazing but most of the missed shots are because the people from columbia are using their horrible ping ot get past and reck you with a melee or shoot you. Even if you pelt them with bullets they will still be alive because their ping didnt register to the server that they werre actually there. Only the client responded to the movement and the server never prohibited anything because the connection was horrible enough to not do it in time. They could peek around cornors and destory 3 people and take a point.Right now, ""Warface"" is still a really fun game to play. but entering the game will make you wish you had some sort of disease that killed you slowly. because the beginner players are so bad, so horrible that they dont have the common sense to follow the objective to win the game. How the game works is, Killing wont make you win the game. Aslong as the objective stands, depending on which side your on. Will determine the game. In a Blitz game you have 2 teams. The blackwood and the warface. 1 team makes sure the bomb explodes as the other tries to defuse it. Seems simple right? Well the team that killed all the defending team killed them. But they didnt defuse the bomb. So the defending team ultimately won. And they never learn.With real money you can do is PAY2WIN! be the scumbag of the community and buy ur way to victory! Trump would be proud of you! be that guy to be a level 1 with level 80 weapons! Be that level 7 guy with full warlord armor (They regen health and shield over time at a decent rate)! And be that guy who has no skill in the 1st place, so he had to buy his way to be able to compete... AND STILL LOSE! XDXDThere are many things this game could add but the developers dont do such a thing. Its past february and they still have the Festive decorations for Christmas. And they were a good few days late on releasing the christmas decorations.Cons to this game:Its playerbase is pretty stupid toxic salty idiots.EU players ruining the game for the NA servers.Pay2win AFYou need people in order to do a mission you could do SOLO.pressing esc in the firing range exits it. so dont even try to change settings while in thereThe channels are brokenAlot of guns are broken (OP AF)Armor needs to be looked at for repricing.Theres No Team BalancingToo many HackersHorrible DevsBS EU people in NA servers (HORRIBLE PING)Jumping SnipersBut... Alass there are a few pros:the game mechanics are outstandingTeambasedgood graphicsAmazing missionsfun gunplaycool looking gunsAwesome game in generalBut is it worth playing?there are a lot of people who have more hours in it that I do. And their and my answer is. No, no its not worth the stress and BS. Stay away from this game as the devs dont give a daum of who you are or if you put money into the game. They will ban anyone for anything. Some of the people they ban are just plain gamers trying to have fun, not even cheating. I'd recomend a Dead Racoon to a child before I recomend this game."

The game is not good enough for me to spend any amount of time trying to fix it...so I uninstalled it, never to be seen again.  Just play Ghost in the Shell."
