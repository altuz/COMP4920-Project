The characters are cool looking and I like that. But the problem that I see is that all the characters are the same other than looks, which sort of bothers me. I would recommend the game as the gameplay is a lot of fun and enjoyable.EDIT: Alright so Now that I've played the game a litle more I want to elaborate more. The devs said they were making the characters unique and that's fantastic I'm super pumped for it, with the new patches there's not really balance issues. Today I got to play with my friend locally and I had SO much fun! I would highly recommend this game"
,Recommended,291550,15621753,"Posted: 30 April, 2015",all,Drizzle,"I've been playing this game since early last year, while it was still in early access, and I've seen the game develop a lot since then.Listen, I'm not going to say that Brawlhalla is bad, because it's not. It's some of the most fun I've had with a fighting game on Steam. The problem is the community, most of the people who play this game are just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Now, like I said, most, not all. I've met some cool people since I started playing this game, but there's so many people who just insult you if you win, hell, even if you lose. It's just a game, it's not that big of a deal.In conclusion. Good game. Crap community."
76561198275983187,Recommended,291550,29663256,Posted: 2 February,all,hearingshark72,"I was originally going to put a two word review like, ""♥♥♥♥ me"" or something along those lines while still giving it a positive review, but I'm going to give it my honest opinion instead.Let's start with the positives shall we, then I'll sock it in the nuts later.It has a super smash feel.It is well balanced-ish.There is no way you can really pay to win, anyone who says you can is an idiot. Now there is a way you can unlock legends quicker than grinding, you may purchase one legend at a time with mammoth coins (micro transaction currency) or you can buy the all legends pack that gives all of them and every future one. My opinion is this is far from pay 2 win, this is actually a downside if you just have all them instead of being forced to play charters and try them, more on this when I get to the cons.It runs on practically anything.Now lets get to the cons.It's ranking is complete load of♥♥♥♥♥♥ So what I'm saying is if you want to play ranked keep playing until you loose because once loose you get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥just enough to throw you off your game. You'll end up loosing every match after that and be at a four times lower elo than when you started. So how this joke of an elo system works is very simple. Win = gain elo, lose = lose elo. This is fine all the up until you hit about mid gold you basically have to win 2 out of 3 matches to keep ascending up the ranks. And even if you keep this consistently it'll be a very slow climb. So let's  you're on a 3 win streak and you're doing good, you jump into the next match and you're going up against somebody who is at a ridiculously higher rank than you and he creams you 3-1 you would end up being the at same place if you just got on and won one and stopped.The community is as salty as ♥♥♥♥. They are constantly complaining about spamming or some sort of imbalance or even a way someone plays. Spamming is there but it's not in every match. The only play style I have a problem with is wall huggers aka ultra passives. Other than that no other play style bothers me. Balancing is for the most part well done. The only thing I can find that I think is imbalanced is high dexterity legends. They are the easiest legends to spam. Spam is usually very easy to get around but when you have a heavy attack (or a signature in the community) as fast as my light attack we have a problem. But I do belive every legend has a legend that they don't match up well against, other than lord vraxx he is the only legend I have a genuine problem with. Way way way to fast, if you get caught in a  lance combo it is  over good luck mashing the dodge button praying you'll hit that one frame that's open.Well to close it up, do I recommend this game? Yes but just know what you're getting into when you play ranked. Or you know what, ♥♥♥♥ ranked just play the game casually."
76561197961494531,Recommended,291550,9981642,"Posted: 30 April, 2014",all,Rapscallion,"*Updated as of version 0.2. Updates in (parentheses)*Brawlhalla is pretty much a smash bro's for the PC, except with a few twists.Here's a Quick Look video I did so you expierence for yourself what this game is like. I've got a summary below for those of you who just like the short and dirty summary. I won't judge. (Please note that throwing weapons is nowhere near as effective now, resulting in longer brawls and less chaotic deaths)http://youtu.be/-RJhu-8S4coThe basic concept of this game is to knock your opponents off the stage the most to win a match. There's no health bars to be seen, and only two basic attack buttons, light and heavy. The heavy attack being what you'll need to use if you wanna send your oppenents rocketing off the screen. Now while you can choose to fight with your bare fists, you can also use the few weapons that constantly get scattered throughout the match. Each weapon you pick up gives you a new moveset to fight with exception for some one-time-use ones like the battlehorn, mines, bombs, and spikeball. And that's pretty much all I can say about the mechanics of the game besides you can dodge, too.However, as simple as it may be, it's still a blast to play over and over again, even better when you have friends over who you can banter with and taunt. It's just satisfying to send enemies bouncing off walls to their demise, even more so when you bounce your weapons/bombs off walls and hit them when they least expected it. I also like when you're waiting a short while for a match to begin, you get matched up with some bots so you're not waiting around and doing nothing.But let's get some of the negatives out of the way.Now I know this is early access, so I'm willing to excuse most of these things I'm about to list:*If you plan to play online, be prepared for terrible lag and characters warping all around the screen. It also isn't fun when you see your weapon connect with an opponent, but it phases through them like a ghost. (Also the online scene is pretty much dead at this point. Not many people playing)*Although there are 4(5 now) different characters currently, they don't play any differently. While it may be balanced, I'd like some variety. (This has been changed somewhat in the new patch. Characters have different stats and some unique moves depending on what you're using)*There is currently only 1 stage and 1 mode you can play, which is a straight deathmatch. Now don't get me wrong, the mode and stage are solid, but at least one more map and maybe a team dealthmatch should've been thrown in as well. (There's a new 1v1 match currently, but if you're single player, you have to do a weird thing by turning off bots, which really leaves one left to fight and allows you to play it. You should just be allowed to click a bot to turn it off or have a stage select.)*The game is super short currently and there isn't much to do/unlock. I've only played for an hour currently and have already seen everything this game has to offer. While this game has great replay value, I'm certain this might turn a few people away for the price this is currently listed at.*Unfortunately, there is also a lack of unique weapons, too. There's a hammer, sword, lance, and a gun, not including the throwing weapons. While the reskinned weapons they have in there may look like they do something different, they don't, so this limits the amount of diversity and mayhem that can happen on screen.But hey, even after all that, why do I still recommend this game? Because it's still fun. And if you're willing to overlook just the lack of content it suffers from currently, I'm sure it'll grow into something better. And if the price tag is the issue, this will become free to play in the future, so you can wait until then to get it. It'll probably have more content by then, too.So to sum it up, this is a solid game that can grow into something much bigger. The local multiplayer is fantastic right now, and if you can stand the lag or maybe get lucky, you may find the online multiplayer fun as well. So if you can look past some the of negatives I listed, you're gonna find yourself having a great time with this game.(I'll try to keep this review up to date, so when major updates start rolling out, please feel free to yell at me to give another look at this game.)"

,Recommended,291550,12939592,"Posted: 14 November, 2014",all,DemonDragonMaster,"Brawlhalla is a 2D brawler game, emulating the stlye of Super Smash Bros but adds it's own little spin and feel to the genre like, having a weapon system that modifies your characters attacks. Each character being able to wield one of two weapons that randomly drop in the map, but at the cost of not being able to grab anything else like mines, spiked balls and other items. The characters have their own stats and are pretty much the same moveset wise, unless when they have their weapons equipped then the get a unique neutral smash attack.Now in beta, with added characters and music tracks, the game itself is more enjoyable. Smoother animations, more weapons, diversity in the cast, the weapons and the soundtrack and now a ""market"" ala LoL (League of Legends) with minor things, like skins and taunts, but not essencial. With no hint of Pay2Win in the horizon the future is a bright one for Brawlhalla.Though not everything is positive, the Arcade mode is basically tournament mode but with bots and no difficulty choice, the online mode is a bit scarce ( I have yet to fight online, no idea if it's due to my timezone or if nobody plays the online ), and making everyone have the same moveset, except when they have weapons which ONLY grants them one move that distinguishes them from the rest, is a bit lack luster but does make skill a much bigger factor in winning a match and not if a character is top tier or not.In conclusion, Brawlhalla is a very good F2P 2D Brawler that has the potencial to become a great game, it's colourful cast and maps are great and wonderfull soundtrack make it pop out in the mixt of brawlers who want to be like Smash Bros and add nothing new to the genre. I'd recommend anyone who likes 2D Brawlers to give this game a whirl, by buying the founders pack, and keep their eyes open for the updates that the dev team is pushing out.*For the Devs*Keep it up guys! Make this game one of the best on Steam!"

,Recommended,291550,29427745,Posted: 22 January,all,Regent | Nein Cat,"Brawlhalla is one of the best games I've ever picked up, and let me explain to you why:1. The fact that you know you are getting good every time you pick the game back up:I've had Brawlhalla for close to a year now, and I'm a low plat. I've spent ~300 in Brawlhalla just with friends, on top of another account I use to boost players in 2v2. If you are to wanna end up long term playing Brawlhalla, save your first game wit ha screen recorder, and watch it when you hit mid-gold. You will cringe at how far you have come, I trust you.2. Practice is rewarding:Brawlhalla is all about fast-paced reactions and learning each characters' moveset. Strings, a combination of moves followed up in a linear fashion, help add a very satisfying edge to the game. With the ~300 hours I've spent, a vast majority of that is just playing with friends in a community, and we all work off eachother while laughing to death about a clash killing both players.3. Competitive has it's ups and downs [GOOD]I see many reviews backtalking the Brawlhalla community, saying how toxic it is. While Ranked in Brawlhalla has many players trashtalking eachother, the people who do trashtalk at the end of a game are not part of the community. The people on the reddit of Brawlhalla and the Discord are one of the most helpful, hilarious people you will ever meet. The person who spams then talks trash at the end of the game will most likely not be on the reddit throwing out a guide on katars.4. Playing with friends is the greatest thing everHopping in a custom online with 7 other friends is the greatest point of playing this game. It's filled with laughs, ""quit targeting me!"", and overall a jolly time.TL;DRDon't let people who spam get the best of you. If you want to go into plat, it's gonna take practice. The game isn't easy, but it's a whole lot of fun once you get it down. Avoid parry and spam, and you'll fit right in with the real Brawlhalla community.If you feel you could be at plat but are being taken down by spammers, look at your rank, and tell me where do you think all the spammers are? That's a bit of food for thought.If anyone wants to spar and help train, go ask on the reddit for any communities, or join the official Brawlhalla discord!"

Each Legend has two of the six total weapons available, and each Legend has a unique special move with each of that two weapons. Then you brawl till the time ends or that's only one stantiding. You can use your weapons, throw them to cause damage and ""delay"" the opponent, you can dodge, and there are the items that spaws in the map: bombs, sticky mines, a thornball, and even a nord berrante that summon a running valkyrie.It may be a little hard to ""get the way"" of this game, however it only takes a few matches for you to understand the basic mechanics.It's super fun to play with friends(4 players maximum), and others can spectate in real-time while you play. If none of your friends are online, you can play single player in quick matches or Tournament, a competition of 3 rounds featuring you against 3 bots each time. There is a ""MISSIONS"" button that is unavailable, so I'm sure we'll have more single player options in th future. For now, one flaw is that the bots get very easy when you get the grasp of the game(although they're not ""super dumb"", they're just easier than a average player)You can buy skins for your characters(with real money), and each skin comes with unique skins for its weapons. You can also buy skins for the weapons itself and taunts, and this is the only time you'll spend money in the game after you get it. No pay to win, no ""oh I'm a millionaire so i'll be super stronga"" sh!ts.It also pops up super rapido when you start it on Steam; no introducing loading screen, no developer logo, just WELCOME! TO BRAWLHALLA!So here's my general opinions:-Very fun;-You have 13 Legends that you can choose. Although there is only 6 weapons(and each Legend has 2), each Legend has somewhat unique abilities, varying from: left mouse buttom, right mouse buttom, right mouse button + directional, right mouse button in the air + up directional...-You can play with your friends (up to 4, free for all or teams) and even ranked matches. The online is still buggy sometimes, but just SOMETIMES;-It can be really ""addictive"" when you learn how to play, because you have many characters and we'll propably going to have more;-Once you got the game, the only thing you pay for is character/weapon skins and taunts, it's not pay to win - real money do not give gaming advantages;-Music is very nice - speaking for myself, I like the soundtrack a lot;-Some bugs here and there that may come up occasionally, but you'll find them very rarely;"

,Recommended,291550,25022093,"Posted: 19 August, 2016",all,Titiontot,"Brawlhalla is a F2P fighting game. More specifically, it's a Platform Fighter game in the same vein as Smash Brothers. Anyone familiar with the Super Smash Brothers series should be able to hop into this game with relative ease, and anyone who doesn't have experience with ANY games like these shouldn't have a hard time either. It's relatively straightforward, but the key difference that sets it apart from Smash is that it's item-based.In Brawlhalla, your default weapon is your fists. You suck with your fists. You have barely any range, your attacks come out slow, and you don't do a lot of damage. Every character in the game has the exact same moveset with their fists. What you're supposed to do is pick up the weapons strewn about the battlefield. Once you get a weapon pickup, you'll randomly be assigned one of two different weapons depending on your character. Lord Vraxx for example can get Guns or a Rocket Lance. Thatch can get a Sword or a Gun. With a weapon, your moveset changes accordingly. Everyone's basic attacks with a weapon are the same (two different characters who both use guns will have similar base movesets) but there is a strong attack button that gives you access to your Signatures, which are like Smash attacks. Every character has 6 signatures (down, side, and neutral - three for each weapon). Using your regular attacks to rack up damage on the opponent and finishing them off with your signature techniques is the key to success here.The fact that all the same weapons have the same basic attacks regardless of who you're playing as means that characters do initially feel much less unique than the rosters in other games like Rivals of Aether, but as a result the game is noticeably more balanced than most and there's more emphasis on individual player skill over the character you're playing. The weapons actually all feel really satisfying to use, and in the right hands you can pull off some pretty insane stuff with them. Feel free to pick a character with weapons you like. There's a viking, a rock dude, a monk, a pirate, and an alien overlord, among others. Gameplay is fluid and tight, and the netcode is surprisingly good.The soundtrack is actually pretty tight too. Nothing's AMAZING but the music is pretty enjoyable to listen to, and the sound effects for each attack feel good, really sound like they hit hard and seriously add to the overall experienceThe game itself is free to play, with a free rotation of heroes each week. You can earn coins through regular play to unlock heroes permanently, but you can easily play and enjoy it all without spending a dime. Compared to games like League and Smite the like, unlocking characters with coins is pretty generous because you'll likely only dedicate yourself to 2 characters at a time (unlike a MOBA where you'd need to learn several so you can fit into a team comp)In addition there's a huge assortment of cosmetic items which you can purchase with real money if you desire. Weirdly enough I openly welcome the amount of cosmetic content there is. Every hero has at least 3 skins, and then there's alternate weapon skins you can get, KO effects, taunts, and sidekicks. The extra customization is nice for anyone who's willing to shell out for it, but if you don't then you're at no more of a disadvantage than anybody else (at least unless you feel like looking ugly is disadvantageous).Partly due to it being F2P, the playerbase is surprisingly healthy. Casual online modes consist of Free For All (4 player brawls) and 1v1 Strikeout (three lives, but each life is a different character). For those who are a little more competitive, there's 1v1 Ranked and 2v2 Ranked. 2v2 in particular is a nice addition, as I find climbing with a friend and being able to wombo combo the enemy into oblivion to be immensely satisfying. I faced some toxicity at lower levels of play (Bronze to low Silver, really) but as I climbed I've met some really cool people. Much like any other fighting game, this requires some quick reflexes and split-second decision making, which may not be present in everyone and if you're not used to this sort of thing it may not be for you. Luckily there's a training mode which lets you work on certain things and gives analysis on attacks, framedata and hitbox info.My only problem would be the art, and it's more like a personal preference than anything else. The art isn't bad, but it resembles something seen from a Facebook game and makes it seem kind of...cheap? The game itself thankfully has a lot of value to it but the art style may turn some people away. The developers are luckily very open and transparent, and take feedback from the community on many internet discussion boards.Key Points+ Fun and satisfying to play+ Not Pay-to-win in any way+ Music is decent+ Well-balanced+ Developers listen to the community and regularly update the game+ Vraxx is kool- Art style may turn some people away@ Somewhat difficult to get intoGet If- You like Smash Brothers- You like F2P games- You like fighting with weapons- You like making people saltyFinal VerdictPick it up. It's free for one, so you don't really lose anything except a little bit of harddrive space. You can play with your buddies too!"

This game has a huge SSB vibe going for it, but not without its own twists and mechanics that make it a loveable game rather than a direct and bland clone. Ide recommend this game to anyone who enjoy the Smash Brothers games and would love that fix on PC.Note you dont need to pay for this game. Its in Closed beta at the moment but you can sign up on the site to be sent a beta invite after some time. It varies between people, but it never takes too long to get one.The only thing I dislike about this game at the moment is the Mammoth Coins(In-game currency like Riot Point or Gems) are super overpriced. All characters are free and only cosmetics can be purchased, and normally ide have no problem supporting the devs and buying some coins, but these are super overpriced.8.5/10 Do Recommend."

,Recommended,291550,17621798,"Posted: 19 August, 2015",all,Claudio,"Brawlhalla; An online Steam version of Smash Brothers, if you will. Like plenty of other all-out multiplayer fighting games, your outlook on this game really depends on your outlook of fighting games in general; If you're a competitive player, you'll probably be a nuisance and complain about the slightest flaws in the games, characters or level design and get turned off my minor issues like that. If you play for fun, however, you'd enjoy the multiplayer experience alongside the fact that it is able to be played with a controller, so no keyboard troubles for you (that is, if you have the USB corb & controller)! The characters are notably memorable from the gnarly ""overpowered"" Gnash to the hustling ""surprisingly female"" Hattori. Each have their own different weapon choices, which makes for different scenarios and unique battles, so long as you don't annoyingly and unnecessarily complain about their ""being overpowered"" or flaws, as that's personal and others can totally prove you wrong. As of now, new characters are being added to the shop, alongside the prior DLC in the forms of Valkris, (as you spell it in-game) weapon skins and costume skins. Each one is unique, and if you got some spare money or would care to costume up some of your personal favorite Brawlhalla characters, go for it! A few bucks would be worth it on a unique look. The recently-new level system made it so that you could obtain gold, skin colors and prior stances for each character. The only problem with the leveling system can get quite tedious a certain of levels in, it's still worth it for some prior stances, skin colors and gold for future characters. They have a ranking system and just a 'for fun' online free-for-all option. The ranking system goes from bronze and progresses a few gems up, and just try not to get frustrated as if you lose, you're likely to get deranked depending on your rank. One notable advantage from Brawlhalla opposed to Smash Brothers is the lack of long updates required to go online and the relative ease of being able to connect online and join a room with friends, not to mention it's quite easy to drop out and spectate. Although Brawlhalla is still being updated and some of the stages are either opinionatedly bland, trippy, or just ""frustrating"", Brawlhalla is an amazing Steam versioned substitute for Smash Brothers, and although it isn't quite as good, it is definitely worth the $13 purchase. Keep in mind that this is my personal opinion and outlook of the game, so if you have your own, feel free to let me know! 9/10; A Clauds recommended online Smash Brothers :]"

I do recommend this game for anyone who likes fast paced brawlers, if you are a fan of the Super Smash Bros franchise (is it a franchise or would it be considered like a series or something? whatever it doesnt matter) you would certainly love this game. I personally believe that if more is added to this game such as more legends(characters), gamemodes, weapons, gadgets, etc. This game could become as good as, if not better then super smash bros.I give this game a 6-7/10 as it is now but im sure if more is added than that score will increase.Major prosFast paced smash bros like combat with less accidental knocking yourself off the edge due to a more useful recovery.different weapons to change up your combat style mid-round.leveling system on your profile and each individual character so you feel like your making progressOnline and local play so u can play with people across the world or in the same roomMajor consEach character is about the same with only the unique combination of 2 weapons to really change there playstyleleveling system is bland without any major upgradesPoor bot AI making single player not really worth itim sure there are other things that i forgot to mention but oh well."

Net code seems pretty solid, I personaly have not experienced much in the form of lag. The controls are tight and I have not noticed balancing issue baring new ledgends when they bring them in, but that gets flushed out.The only downside to this is the games buisness model. I got into it with the All Ledgend pack. With that pack, the micro transactions are all cosmetic, but honestly I would be more than willing to drop the money for a full release cost on this and not have them in the game at all. The Skins are cool looking but frankly just not worth it at the current costs. I don't say this to rag on the game, I say this because I love the game and I think it would be so much better as a traditional game or at least a skins pack."

They have one, it only sells cosmetic character skins and weapon skins, You buy the characters with earned in game gold, not money. Don't avoid because its f2p.Very easy to pick up with an active community and skilled players. Four modes of online play, ranked 1v1,2v2, 4 player free for all and custom lobby's that let you set the match to all sorts of things ((up to 8 players in one map)).In the ranked matches, expect spammers in low tier with skilled players being in low gold and up. Spam happens, but you will eventually be able to read the attack patterns and punish them easily.Single player is lackluster at best, but the training mode lets you try out all the legends((and check out the skins)) before you buy them with game earned gold.Why do I like this game? Because I lose to players who are better than me. I do not lose to spam or ""cheap"" characters because the game does not reward these things. It is up to the player to learn how to play the game. At the start you might win some matches by spamming. More power to you, if your opponent does not know how to counter your spam you will always win. Once they do however, you can either keep mashing the keys hoping it works, or you can improve.This is a game of skill, pure and simple. Luck does not play a part of it, and I can honestly say after 100+ hours, there is not one single character better than the other. They all have strenghts and weaknesses, but the game allows you to main one and win if you are better than the player on the other side. In the immortal words of our forums, ""git gud""."

The game is fairly beginner friendly, but has plenty of depth for players looking for more than a casual experience."
,Recommended,291550,29836489,Posted: 10 February,all,RogueKriger,"To me, this is what would Smash or Brawl would look like if you used Dota characters, but personally I like it.Controls are relatively easy, customization is interesting, and unlockables are just hard enough to obtain to be interesting.Have played very little competively and the community is salty/toxic. And like most fighting games spamming and broken characters do run rampent at times.HOWEVERThe game is fun to play and a great time waster. I would definitely recommend if you want a game you and your friends can play together or something along those lines.As for competitive or strictly matchmaking, it would really depend on your own preference. The occasional salt doesnt bother me after playing hours of CoD and Halo Wars years back, but if it gets to you, maybe look somewhere else."

,Recommended,291550,29806105,Posted: 9 February,all,Aundrais,I recommend this game if you have friends to play it with. The community is kind of toxic from my expierience. Go into a casual game and you typically get paired up against people who are high rated in clans and are just plain better than you and then trash talk you for being a noob after they win. For some reason there are a ton of really good players in the lowest bracket of rated who are in clans so climbing the bracket is pretty difficult if you don't have good players to practice with. I LOVE this game but it's much more enjoyable in my opinion with friends as a casual game. Otherwise I wouldn't really recommend this game for people who are just looking to have some fun and a good community.

You can also play with a controller.There are a few different weapons in the game; The Sword, the Hammer, the Rocket Lance, the Spear, the Blastars and the Katars. Each have their very own moveset, and every of the characters have a special move with one of these weapons. As an example, Bödvar's special attack with the Hammer is a Bear spirit appearing behind him, while Gnash's is a overhead smash that lifts the floor itself!Its a very cartoonish game, very similar to Super Smash Bros actually. Its more than worth the 15$! There is still a few things that the devs should add, like queuing up with friends, 2v2 online games, etc., but so far so good!"
,Recommended,291550,15722133,"Posted: 6 May, 2015",all,Fucksmith,"TL;DR:It's a great game already. if you like the kind of combat you find in smash, if you like shiny ranks, and if you like nice streamers, then this is for you!PROs:- It's not a traditional combo-based fighter. Anyone familiar with smash bros will feel right at home.- The attacks feel very satisfying. The controls are super smooth too.- Dare I say it? Yeah, I do: Items feel very  balanced in this game. None of this FOX ONLY NO ITEMS FINAL DESTINATION stuff.- You pick up one of two character specific weapons that alter your moveset (you drop 'em if you get wrecked).- The weapons spawning randomly on the battlefield opens up for quake-like weapon denying, which is pretty fun, both as the guy trying to outmaneuver the guy with the pointy rocket-stick and said rocket-stick guy who's got a scrub to turn into a pincushion (they spawn rather regularly, so dying once wont end the game for you).- You can throw your weapon. and it feels so satisfying to toss a spear in someones face and then grab it into a combo.- I'll actually put in another PRO just for throwing. Did I mention it feels satisfying?- It has a training mode that displays hitboxes and hurtboxes clear as day. It makes practicing easy.- There is a cash shop, but it contains cosmetics only.- Extremely polished for an early access title. This is what early access should be like.CONs:-Only one server, and its in the US. Playing fighting games online with 150< ms is not particularly entertaining (Hopefully us europoors will get our grubby mitts on one of our own soon enough).NOW IS THE TIME EUROBROS- The health circles at the top right is a bit far off. One glance up there to gauge everyones health could be your unfortunate end. (if you put it at the bottom of the screen like smash does that'd be swell. I wont tell nintendo)- The hardest CPU setting in training is nowhere near a player in terms of difficulty.- The announcer pronounces Bödvars name as Bodvar.Now keep in mind folks, this game is compared a lot to smash but it is its own game. Its probably not going to be completely similar to smash bros, but that doesn't stop it from being a fantastic game.Now if the developers of this game happens to be reading this:Thank you for being the first to make a game like this for pc! I bought the collectors pack and I'll try my best to prove to you that there is a market for this kind of game by forcing friends to do the same at gunpoint.  I hope you will continue working hard on this great game.I'd give this game an 8/10, and its probably gonna be my 9 or even 10 after it goes out of beta."

I felt I got enough of the game to form a review.Brawlhalla is a fighting game like that of super smash bros. By that I mean you try to dish out enough damage onto your opponents until they are weak enough to deliever a final blow that will knock them off the edge of the map or screen to their deaths. But where this game differ is in the use of the weapons. Each character in the Brawlhalla cast have 2 sets of main weapons they can use. These weapons are the sword, spear, hammer, twin blades, twin guns, axe, lance. Now these weapons may have different skins or looks but they handle in a very similar way. Each character have heavy and light attacks they can perform with these weapons and the speed and powers of these weapons vary from character to character. Also each character have their own stats for their weapons. I won't comment on this, since this beta is in use so developers can see which character still need balancing, but from this current patch (v1.14.0) I'm on it seem to be coming along nicely.You can still melee and attack without your main weapons, but you feel naked without them. There also items like spike balls, mines, and bombs to throw at opponent if you don't have a weapon in hand. Honestly the combat feel solid, and the use of the weapons make this game stand out from Super Smash Bros. Visually the game looks great, and the levels look fine. I guess my only real complaint is that I wish there was more maps or more variations between each map. But again I know this a beta, and most likely there will be more to come.All in all, I'm glad the PC gamers now have a fighting game that is as fun as Super Smash Bros to play on their PC."

It invites that signature fighting style which focuses more on the environment and forcing opponents out of it. However, it is very unique in that it creates a new mechanic which involves picking up weapons to introduce new movesets to characters. Each character has 2 sets of moves which enforce their own fighting style; for example, Taurus, a Minotaur character, has both a hammer and an axe. Each has its own abilities. With this, Brawhalla is an interesting game to play around with, but if you're looking for more of a Smash Bros. clone, I would suggest getting Rivals of Aether."

It's large cast of characters and mechanincs makes it fun for new players and competitive for veterans. Thinking quickly is essential in this game and can lead a loss to a victory. Many people exclaim that the community is toxic which is not true,, only some players are. However there are nice person who can cheer up your day or can even become your friend :D. One good thing about Brawlhalla is that it is not pay-to-win. Sure you can pay for skins of your favourite characters, but it is not essential to 'getting good'. Spammers can be quite annoying, but if you are a good player/thinker you can get past them. The one major issue is the ranked matchmaking system. Sometimes you get matched with people 300 elo(points) ahead of you. I think the developers should take some time to change the matchmaking system. Other than that it is a great game that is FREE! have a great day :D"

Your skills from Smash won't carry over too well. As opposed to Smash in which you have one constant moveset and an array of generally annoying items, Brawlhalla gives you three rapidly changing movesets with items that are considerably more fair to it's target. That being said, characters are not too terribly unique or memorable. You are more likely to remember them as the fast ninja one, the steampunk girl, and so forth. It still is a beta, so they may flesh out the characters more as we approach a official release.TL;DRA very unique take on the platform fighter genre, but don't expect too much in terms of character personality."

First and foremost this is because the dedication the developers put into it, which is directly apparent. Everything from layout, interface, (soon to be) legends and their facebook etc show that they plan on sparing no expenses here and want this game to become as big as possible.At first I was taken back by the 2D cartoon graphics, I was afraid this would be some cheesy newgrounds-ish flash game, but I funded it anyways because I'm a sucker for brawlers. BUT, I was fraught in vain; s someone else wrote in their review here, the graphics were bloopin crisp, with detailed effects and motions. Also I love the artstyle.Since this is in beta there are of course alot of content missing and alot of touching up to be done but I am impressed with how much they have done with yet so little. Me and my girlfriend have had hours of fun. So what I am hoping to see more of in the future is:- Some touching up of the controls. I play with a 360 controler and have been loving the responsiveness but there are a few instances when jumping from ground have not responded as I would like it to. Perhaps jumping could cancel the longer attack moves?- More character unique moves. I guess that has to be one of the more time consuming aspects to make but the game could relly benefit from having more moves to learn etc. as we all do love learning and timing special moves in games as tekken and street fighter.- I would love to see more statistics when playing online. I love competetive gaming and to be able to track and record how well I'm doing against others, trying to beat them, it could keep me playing for hours on end.- and of course a metric mega tonne of more content, characters, maps and skins.Thatch-crew 4evz"

I would like to see this feature evolve from being only gettable through paying, maybe something like after sooo many matches with a character you can choose a random box and that box will have a skin pack for your character youve been using. Although I do understand them having it right now due to it being in beta and probably needing funding I would like to see it change in the future. One feature that I am extreemly posetive that everyone will pleed for is workshop, If you add steam workshop capabilities to this game then it will sell like theres no tomorrow and by that i mean let us create our own characters and maps then upload them to workshop for other people to download even if its not new characters its just skins for characters it would still be nice to have. It could be like contagion or left 4 dead with the workshop where to play the map everyone needs the map installed but the skins are only client side. all in all I give it a 9/10 for the quality and amazement of this game for just being in beta and I feal that it is going to be amazing when its fully release...ps I love the ability for local play like on the same computer but also having online( it's sadly a feature that we need to see more of to make our single player exsperience more freindly where you can sit with some palls)"

There is quite a selection and you won't be dissapointed.Gameplay: Fast, Frantic, and Fantastic!  There are spammers (especially with swords--SWORD SPAMERS T.T) but it is relatively easy to couter when you fight it constantly (such is the hell of bronze 2).  Aside from the spammers the combat is amazing and varied.  I cannot stress enough how important the dodge feature is.  Without this feature the spammers would really have the upper hand and the whole game would suffer.  LEARN HOW TO DODGE!

Right now it has some glaring problems that mainly revolve around variety. Base movesets are all identical. What character variety there is comes from the weapons that they're assigned - and many of the moves performed with those are shared, as well. The end result is that not a single character in the roster has any kind of mechanic that they can really call their own.This also applies to the character artstyle - dentical proportions and an abundance of Dreamworks-style smirk, along with copy-pasted movesets combine to rob the characters of any real kind of personality. It doesn't help that they have a very amateurish Newgrounds feel to their appearance."

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!"

This is the worst thing about this game, Literally all someone has to do to usually win is the same thing over and over again. From inescapable moves to the zero to death combos people are able to pull. It's just not cool, and i wish the game had more ways to counter.Community: It's trash. Completely and utteraly trash. Yeah sure, you'll meet some nice people here or there, but if your spamming because your so tired of losing all the time, the round will end with kys, f off, hang yourself. or, even if they barely win its nothing but ""GG ez"" which, i know sounds petty for someone to complain about, but you don't undestand until you ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME.lag issues are a thing also, which can completely ruin game experience. this game requires you to be able to dodge or counter at the right moment, so when you lag you can't  really do much. It's not that im  playing on a crap system, or that my internet is bad, because it's really not that hard to meet any of those standards. it's just game servers bugging out sometimes.Down to my final point. I tried to take this game competitively, and no matter how hard i try, no matter how much i play, i can't get anywhere. So, basically this is more of a personal review for me.

If you were looking for a Smash Bros equivalent, this is really as close as we can get right now.Pros:1) Great art style2) Guaranteed ""Oh man, did that just happen?!"" moments in every match. It's super entertaining to double KO your opponents with one charged move.3) Tight controls that are great for beginners but very deep and rewarding for people that take the time to master them.4) Numerous characters with great artwork and decent animation.5) The different weapon types have very distinct styles and mastery of each is integral to staying in the ring.6) Local Co-op as well as Online multiplayer.Cons:1) Buying a skin for a weapon besides the lance seems somewhat pointless since most matches have the camera extremely zoomed out. For instance, on a 50"" HDTV at 1080p, you can't really tell the difference between some of the cosmetic weapon skins.2) Even though the artwork is distinct, the camera in 1 can be a problem. The colors don't pop as well as I think they should to differentiate from different players.3) More weapon type variations would be nice.The cons definitely do not detract enough from the game to make this anything but a strong recommendation.

However seeing larger and perhaps more complicated maps would be nice.Very good game overall. It has a strong core mechanic. Currently there are limited maps / characters but this is to be expected in a Beta. More focus seems to be spent on developing the game mechanics and balancing with a slow trickle of characters and maps released on occasion.Despite the early stages of development it still very much feels like a complete game, and the limited current content does not at all take away from playability.The price tag is more than reasonable, particularly given the promise of future content.Subscribe to my curator page for more local multiplayer recommendations:http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7189360/Check out my Couch Gaming group for specials, bundles, etc:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CGLM"
,Recommended,291550,12957554,"Posted: 15 November, 2014",all,Asvarduil,"[First Impression Review - will be modified as my experience with the title increases/changes.]Once upon a time, the Norse Gods of Video Games brought a bunch of people from various times to Brawlhalla, their castle in the clouds where battles always rage for the Aesir's delight!Brawlhalla is heavily based on the Smash Bros. franchise for the Nintendo systems.  The goal of the game varies slightly based on game mode, but it usually involves hitting your opponents to make them fly farther...then, knocking them off of the stage.Based on my training session, it appears that the items aren't as bad as the Nintendo Smash games - usually, in the Nintendo games, there are a bunch of useless or nigh-useless items that get strewn about on the field that don't really have a great deal of value.  In Brawlhalla, this is very nicely averted by the guardians leaving weapons.  Be very mindful what you pick up, because it influences your character's fighting style!  The implication of this is that you can change styles mid-fight...provided your opponent can't reason you strategy.As I'm making this review, though, I'm doing so with less than 24 hours in-game.  That's a little low, right?  Well, this game isn't all sugar and rainbows.The level design is rather bad; it's not quite to Final Fantasy XIII levels of awfulness, but I can sum up the existing levels in a set of broad statistics: ""25% land, 75% pit.""  There are no maps like Hyrule Temple where you have a bunch of terrain options.  There are no periodic hazards you can use to your advantage.  The arenas are extremely bland, to the point of being lifeless and vanilla.Another problem, at least for some, is that microtransactions exist in this game.  The developers seem to be aware of how much microtransactions are abused, becuase they've taken steps to ensure that only heroes or cosmetic changes can be bought.  They've learned the lessons of the modern games industry and the games audience well!  NEVER SELL POWER!!!PROS:+ Remappable controls+ Quick support - my control issues were resolved within two days by a developer!+ Great visuals+ Great music+ Feels like a Nintendo Smash game+ Pickups are nearly always useful (Nintendo, Mr. Saturn does not belong in a Smash game.  Sorry.)+ Mallhalla is the best Norse-inspired pun I have yet read in a game.+ The microtransaction store only sells cosmetic upgrades, it doesn't sell power.CONS:- The current stages are 75% pit, 25% land- The current stages are soulless arenas, not imagination-inspiring battlefields- At the time of this writing, there are only a handful of weapons and characters.This is a fun multiplayer brawler that has supreme potential to be just as awesome as the Nintendo Smash Bros. games, only for the PC Master Race!  I can tentatively recommend this game, with the caveat that this game is Early Access, so you're taking a risk by investing in it.  Pray that the developers come through on their end of this great game-to-be."

,Recommended,291550,29795450,Posted: 8 February,all,Ryoverbッ,"If you're seeing this game for the first time IT'S NOT A COPY OF SMASH. I REPEAT NOT A COPYBrawlhalla (Salthalla) is quite a fun game to play. It's easy to learn but hard to master is what most people say and I agree with that.Each legend has different stats that affect the legend's play style. Each legend also has 2 different weapons (Ex. Orion has a  spear and a rocket lance) The game is very solid for being in beta, heck I'd even call it a full game if it weren't for a few things that needed to be added into the game. First thing right off the bat IT'S NOT PAY TO WIN. The only thing real money can achieve you in this game is pure cosmetic items which support BMG when you buy them. I repeat, COSMETIC ITEMS DO NOT HAVE ANY AFFECT ON STATS OR GAMEPLAY WHATSOEVER. While adding to the legend stats, the stats that each legend has is Attack, Defense, Dexterity, and Speed. Each legend has a stance for each one of these attributes which allows you to mix up your play style a bit. Some might argue but right now (for me at least) all the legends are balanced. The fighting, the meat of the game. When starting, all players start off unarmed and weapon and items spawn throughout the game. Every legend has the same moves for unarmed but when it comes to weapons, it's kind of a different story. Light attacks are the same for all legends (Ex. Hattori NLight with sword is identical to Val Nlight with sword) This is where each legend becomes unique. Each legend has a set of signatures that are (obviously) special attacks that deal heavy damage and are unique to each legend and weapon. Legends can also dodge during a match allowing you to become invincible for a second. Dodging in the air and performing an attack is called a gravity cancel, which allows you to use certain moves that you normally can't use when in the air. The fighting is very solid basically. Obviously some features are missing as Brawlhalla is only in Beta. (Ex. You can only do 2v2 ranked with a friend or guildmate)This is one of my biggest reasons of hate for this game. The community. I'd say at least 70% of the community is full of non toxic people that will help other players and actually say GG after a match. The other 30% is pure toxic. It is most likely that you will end up playing against a toxic player and will trash talk you if you end up losing to them. If you end up beating a toxic player, they will 100% of the time be salty and call you a noob (even though they are admiting a noob beat them) It's best to just ignore them. (If you say EZ after beating anyone and it was a close match, just kill your self) Another really bad thing about Brawlhalla (Salthalla) is that the servers and netcode are kind of bad and I usually end up lagging even though I have good internet connection. If you end up playing someone with bad internet, good luck.In conclusion Brawlhalla is a great game, the pros outweigh the cons in my opinion. Wait did I say brawlhalla? I meant SALTHALLA"

Generally speaking in fighting games you have to fight the other player by either being aggressive and dishing out punches or being defensive and punishing if the opponent overextends. In this game you have a dodge, which makes you completely invulnerable for a short period of time, not even acknowledging the other players attack allowing you to instantly execute and attack of your own. This makes most ranked games a passive aggressive-fest where 1 person will just wait for the other to finally throw out a move, dodge it and then attack the other. In most other fighting games the game timer will never reach zero, i myself have only ever had it happen once in tekken and never in any other game. In this game ive had many matches reach the 0 mark, and the game timer is 5 minutes compared to street fighter and tekkens 99 seconds. This dodge problem is amplified by there being 2 other dodge types in the game ( i wont go into those).Overall this game is fun to play casually, and the only good online mode are either the event ones or 4 player FFA, i cant reccommend 1v1 or ranked due to the fundamentally stupid game mechanics. I myself will definately play this game with my friends on ps4 when it (eventually) comes out (also i was plat before i stopped playing so dont call me a noob)."

,Recommended,291550,12702012,"Posted: 30 October, 2014",all,Ahutz,"I enjoy Brawlhalla. Below are my poorly organized thoughts on the game and the direction I would like see the development take.--------------- I’m slightly concerned as the upcoming update seems to deal with introducing more characters. I don’t feel Brawlhalla needs a deeper roster of characters in its initial phase. I think attention being paid to creating new characters is a mistake while other parts of the game remain more shallow than the current roster of characters. Specifically I think attention needs to be paid to level variety. Each existing character should have their own level, simply in the sense that the theme of the level corresponds to the character. Currently in Brawlhalla there are I think double as many characters as levels and not a single level seems to match up to any characters.  In my opinion eight characters and eight unique levels is more enjoyable than twelve characters and four non-connected levels. Every  level should feel different top to bottom, everything from music, layout, and color scheme. Currently the levels in Brawlhalla feel generic and I would like to see them tailored so that each character has their own level. I would also like to the see the current levels and any additional levels have a more interactive element to them. I’m concerned that the creation of new characters seems to have priority over the creation of fun levels to fight within.  If the developers can create a character with a unique look and fighting style, there is no excuse for why they can’t do the same with the level design.- I’d like to see player sizes be scaled to be more representative of the characters. Some characters should be larger than other character, whereas, some characters should be smaller. Currently all the characters are the same size, and I think that’s a problem for both immersion and game balance. While talking about player size. I’d like to briefly touch on hit detection and hit priority. Most noticeably it seems hit detection is poor when dealing with UP-Aerial attacks and DOWN-Aerial attacks. The most obvious lack of hit-detetcion is when trying to hit an opponent who is above you in the air, when your character is below. Moving on, I think there is poorly working hit-priority in this game. Depending on a characters attributes shouldn’t say stronger characters attacks take priority over a weaker characters when they’re both attacking each other at the same time? This doesn’t seem to be the case from my limited time playing Brawlhalla. I think by changing the scale of characters that would allow for better hit detection and a more visible representation of the priority of attacks when people are fighting. There are things in Brawlhalla like character stats for attributes like speed/dexterity/strength and so on, this all seems silly as when you’re actually playing the game there don’t seem to be many differences between the characters. If you’re going to include stats the difference between characters needs to be significantly more pronounced, that includes both size and scale as well as hit detection and hit priority.A lot of fighting games live and die based on how viable they are for competitive players, that’s the harsh reality of this genre.  The fighting mechanics of Brawlhalla I think need to be fine tuned. There simply isn’t enough here to keep non-causal players around. Perhaps adding the ability for players to block or even grab each other would go a long way towards alleviating some of the shortfalls of the current combat system?- Items and their role in Brawlhalla. Brawlhalla seems to be somewhat balanced around the spear-like weapons and to a lesser extent the gun or sword weapons. I’ve found this to be fun and I think the weapons are well balanced and the attacks and animations are varied well enough. It’s of my opinion that items are appearing with too great a frequency. Due to weapons appearing too frequently their importance has been marginalized. There is no incentive to rush across the board and fight over a spear or any other weapon as within moments another weapon will appear and then another and so on. Most importantly, the frequency of item distribution leads to spears, guns, and swords, being primarily used as charged-up projectile attacks since you can always almost instantly pick up another spear, gun, or sword. Brawlhalla is fast-paced and with too many items on the screen the gameplay is frenzied. So it’s beneficial to keep distance between yourself and the other opponents. The most efficient way to do this is to throw weapons instead of using weapons to actually fight with. Since there is almost an endless supply of weapons and items there is no penalty for choosing to throw my weapon away instead of fighting with it. Considering the strength of the items and weapons, it seems odd to create a gameplay style that devalues them.There also needs to be more variety of items introduced into the game. Currently there are simply too few items available and coupled with the high frequency of appearance,  I can’t be the only person who is fatigued already of the items in this game. My suggestion would be to focus on introducing not more weapons, but, more unique items. The goal of items/weapons (outside the core spears, swords, and guns) should be to introduce randomness into the game at least to a reasonable extent. I would suggest thinking about adding some generic power-ups and trying to put a Brawlhalla spin on them.  Currently there simply are too few items in Brawlhalla and the items or weapons that are available appears with such a high frequency that they are creating likely a gameplay that isn’t as intended.- Customized game options. When setting up a match for both online or local play, the users should be able to customize every aspect of the ruleset. From number of lives, length of match time, what items appear and at what frequency. I would also like to see the inclusion of an optional handicap system as a way to balance the game for players who are of great skill differences.- I think the scoreboard should be moved from the top right to the bottom center. The least used real estate on the screen is the bottom middle as that is typically the underside of a level. IThe top right, where the scoreboard currently is, is too action filled as there is lots of aerial combat in this game and jumping to the side. Also considering the pace of Brawlhalla it’s difficult to look away to the top right and check both health and scores. I think making the scoreboard larger and placing in the bottom center of the screen is more functional and visually pleasing.- Add Taunts/Cheers.  If you look at many successful fighting games of the past, taunts or cheers are iconic parts of those games. I would like to see a single animation and accompanying sound effect for each character to act as a taunt or a cheer. I would like this “move” to be used freely in game. I think other players of Brawlhalla and fans of this genre would find it to be a welcome addition.--------------------Overall, Brawlhalla is a fun game, however, the current core fighting mechanics are simply too shallow. On the positive Brawlhalla is only in the Alpha Stage and hopefully by time it reaches the Beta Stage the game will have made improvements in the areas I’ve rambled on about above."

A nice and cheaper alternative choice for SSB4.Pros:-Easy-to-learn gameplay, each character has its own unique moves and weapons and at the same time they are all similar, so the game is balanced and anyone can play their favourite chars.-Nice visual experience, even if the animation is skelleton-like.-Easy and quick matchup in netplay, and very simple but effective ""custom online"" to play with friends.-In-game coins free when buying the early access.-Controller friendly.Cons:-Feels buggy so far, but runs well.-Some characters are not often used in online matches.-In-game coins are always bought with real money and not won in matches, and skins are a bit too expensive for the coins to be real money.-Needs better character dubbing to immprove the experience.-Only the buyer receives the benefits when buying the friends pack.Things that should be improved:-Cheaper skins and stuff.-More items apart from bombs, mines, horns and spike balls.-Add more weapons per char (for example, each character can choose 2 out of 3 for the match).-Winning coins by winning matches.-More voices.Still, the alpha so far is great.

,Not Recommended,291550,29531565,Posted: 27 January,all,Freefork,"Wait, hold on. Why would anyone waste their time writing a review for a free game? Uh... I don't know.Brawl...HALLA is a fun game that changes a lot about the smash formula. As a Melee veteran, I can tell you playing this game like Melee is like playing Mario Kart like Mario Party. YOU WILL LOSE IF YOU DARE TO:Trying to gimp in a game with infinite jumps and no edges is DUMB.Trying to wavedash is DUMB due to the fact the animation still plays on the ground... leaving you kinda open.Trying to L-cancel is DUMB.Rarely using Smash attacks (Strong as there called in this game) is DUMB.And trying to change your mindset on how to approach an opponent for each character is DUMB.In this game, animations and lag stay until you're hit or it ends. Meaning you can hit the ground with an aerial and your character will still wift their attack. Smash attacks are fast and EXTREMELY useful in this game because of the fact you can start the attack on an edge and continue the attack OFF-STAGE.Heck, characters aren't really different from each other. It is the weapons that you pick up mid-match that determine your playstyle. The only main difference between characters really are their smash attacks(yes, characters can have the same weapon).So go play the game. Nothing will happen to your game experience if you play with or without pay. Paying is only their to personalize your characters. My only issue is the game simplicity. No advanced tech, no moves with many alternate uses. The game is painfully straightforward for what it is. Brawlhalla is a great name for this game. I guess Rivals of Aether would be Meleehalla and Brawlout would be 64halla. But what would be Smash 4halla?Trash, of course!(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trash_(video_game))I give Brawlhalla a 6/10. Below average. I recommend it to those who keep items on or want a unique twist on the smash genre."

Brawlhalla is a free to play brawler which is essentially a platform fighter. Brawlhalla is  not one of those ""pay to win"" money grubbing games, its a pay to look pretty money grubbing game. theres a difference.In singles you can have a good time and win some games, lose some games, but in doubles its a constant cluster ♥♥♥♥ of your friend (Henry) beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you with bombs (again... Henry). However if you're looking for a good time, Brawlhalla makes a great party game, a great game to play with friends, and most importantly a great game to play alone. Now lets address the the elephant in the room, the community. Bralhalla HAD a great community, it was smll but it was loyal and forgiving, but now im noticing a lot of CS:GO players playing Brawlhalla and honestly its ruining it. after every loss now you hear things like ""SCRUB, bad, kys, drink bleach, i hope your mother gets cancer"" ya know fun stuff like that, if you want a game with a nice community i would not reccomend this game as it grows to become more toxic than League of legends. But none the less its a fun game to play with friends (unless you have a henry) so get ready to play the most addicting game you have ever played and climb the ranks to become the best. and remember...

As you get better you soon realize it's not about strategy or quick reflexes, but how you sucker people with dodge and throw crap at them.  Should change the name to throwhalla or dodgehalla, cause there is no brawling going on.  For every one game that is an exciting brawl, there are nine games of pure aggravation.  Too bad, it had potential.  The art style looks like an app game.  Mechanics are good.  Some bugs are lag and the occassional hit you in one direction, but flew to the other direction.  Not common, but are still there.  The community is bratty little kids, with the rare exception of some nice folks I met.Dash is the dumbest idea ever.

Characters are rotated so you get a taste of them all, and all unlockable characters and items are accessable in training.Music and aethestics are quite well done.The mechanics are a tad simple, but solid in their own right, with heavy emphasis on moving around. If you rely heavily on blocking in other games, prepare to have your world rocked.Despite only the heavy ground attacks varying between characters, each feels and pays different enough, and they all look really cool on top of that.So why am i not recommending this game? Online, simple as that. Everybody who i know who has got this game(mind you, we all have varying locations and interent speeds) has found online to be virtually unplayable. Incredible amounts of lag, disconnects, input delays, and a lack of variety in characters due to the weekly challenges making everyone play the same two. and because online play is how you get gold, forget about buying the legends without real world money. Every other game i've ever gotten and played(excluding Nintendo's awful online) runs quite well, so this relatively small and simple game should not struggle so much with a stable connection. And i'm not even going to mention toxic players. That one's a given.Once online runs better, i will switch to a recommend. Until then, if you don't have people to play locally with you and don't want only bot matches, don't bother getting this game and certainly don't put any money into it."

( It is definetely not my connection, my friends experience the same in the same matches. )- Items in Ranked ; they add a completely unneeded and ridiculous level of RNG to the game, especially considering the netcode.- False hitboxes : Some moves have wrong hitboxes that are either bigger or smaller than their visual effects.- Stale meta : Sword is and has been the best weapon in the game for an eternity ; Hattori is and has been the best champion since all of her sigs are very unique and can put her in situations in which she is invulnerable to most attacks.This may not be a problem for pro players, but it causes the game to be incredibly unfun in the medium ranks.- Only viable playstyle is defensive ; If you don't do anything but stay put, read the enemies and dodge them just to punish them you will fail, which can lead to matches in which nobody does something and the player that presses a key wins first."

For a dumb party game with friends? Yes it's fine. For a competitive 1 v 1 game? Not quite there yet. To master this game you need to know 3 things.1.Each character can equip 2 weapons; you can't customize which weapons you want, they're pre set. Currently the game heavily favors Swords, Katars, and to a lesser extent Guns. So choose a character who can use at least one of these things and you already have a good upper hand.2.Hit boxes don't work the way you think. There is no collision detection in the game so just because you see your weapon hit your opponent it does not mean it actually hit. If you go into training mode you can turn on hit detection and bear witness to the most bizarre hit boxes ever conceived.3.Load up YouTube and look up combo videos. Each weapon has two or three combos and that's about it. You want to get those off as often as possible and pray the RNG gods favor you for an early kill. I have seen full charged heavy attacks not kill dark red status opponents. I have seen sword combos that get you from white to dark yellow with no escape. It's very frustrating to experience.Also, there is strangely no indicator of when you can dodge. There's a cooldown for it after being used but the time until you can use it again has no display. That's pretty frustrating too.. All in all, fun party game (ala Diet Smash) but currently a poor competitive one."

This game you can just spam the same keys over and over again and win any match. It is not actually skill based at all unless you are very high ranked. Ranked play is the same spammy characters that can spam a bunch of power attacks and the axe weapon is completely overpowered.

,Not Recommended,291550,16613981,"Posted: 22 June, 2015",all,ShoTro,"I was looking into supporting the development of this game as I love the crazy and random fun of Smash Brothers. I am not a competative player by any means. I like to just sit on the couch and play with some friends who don't take the game too seriously. Given that, this is my review of Brawlhalla, a game that many claim is very similar to SSB.The short review: I got a refund. ""It isn't fun"".I can't consciously recommend this game to fans of Smash Brothers, any of them. The issue lies in the characters and the developer choice to make all the characters EXACTLY the same. Literally they all share the same 2D skeletal animations. There will be no boswers or other larger characters or even smaller characters (unless scaled which would be appalling). They all have the same default attacks from what I can tell. They all can change their stats before a match making their appearance WORTHLESS. You might have fought the same guy as an agile fighter, but the next time you play he will be a heavy brawler. This makes no sense and kills the fun. The fact they have so many characters of this EXACT SAME TYPE and it is Beta leads me to believe they have no intention of changing this.Also, there are no cues on almost anything in the game. It is mass confusion and not in the fun interesting way Smash Bros is.If you are looking for items to use against your opponents... there are three, maybe four in the entire game. Bomb, sticky bomb, and spike ball. The rest are one of your two weapons, which are not unique to your character. It would be a thousand times better if you could use any weapon and the characters you are fighting with just get suped up attacks for using the weapons they are experienced with, leading to interesting gameplay between players on the screen, instead you get indistinguishable swords which could mean: guns, hammers, knives, staves, etc, and even swords, but these are all dependent on which character you pick, because it will only be one of their two weapons. That is the only thing that defines the characters in this game besides their voices which don't stand out much when they move and act like every other character.You are basically picking load-outs of the range of weapons when you pick a character, which is very disappointing.After being recommended this game I played a little of it then went over to a friend’s place to asking him why I just wasted my money. We played about an hour and a half on his machine, but I was totally bored. I have seen everything in the game by that time and it is disappointing. I am getting a refund until this game finally includes something interesting worth the money.Pros:- basic smash bros style combat.- There are a few levels?Cons:- Characters can be smashed by some characters attacks sometimes, but not others at the same ""health"". I am assuming the characters have different stats but there is no way to tell.- One character with different loadouts and skins - no personalities- Uninspired level design - just platforms- Confusing and bland audio design for a genre that needs to be bombastic- A baffling lack of items- Most of what you want to see out of this game is missingNow, before people get too upset with this review, I know this is Beta, but we are still reviewing a Beta, if the game improves I will be revisiting it again later, but right now it garners a negative review. Yes, you have damage represented in percentage and a few items scattered around the levels, but this lacks some rudimentry things I am looking for in a SSB clone that other indie developers have done in the past. This game also lacks rudimentary visual cues for players which makes it hard to enjoy when that fast agile player you stomped can pick the same character and fix their stats between matches. Or out of nowhere you get slammed out of the arena while not quite near 100% by a character who didn't charge an attack before you got there.I have to ask while playing this, ""Why did that happen?"" then guess that the player changed their stats between games, got lucky or that I got two characters confused because their silhouettes are almost identical on the screen. There is very little visually that will clue you in on to why something is happening, and that isn't the random variety I was expecting."

76561198332930712,Recommended,291550,29534616,Posted: 27 January,all,megageek2013,"This game plays alot like a Super Smash Brothers game, but does enough different to justify existing. The combat system is a bit simpler with each character having only 3 specials instead of 4 and all the characters sharing from a weapon pool of about 10 or so weapons and you have to pick up a weapon in the area at the start, each time you die or if you take enough of a beating to drop it.The main draw for me other than gameplay is the quirky cast of warriors each with a unique backstory, although they pull from common archetypes and stereotypes each legend has their own personality and reading all the backstories can be fun in it's own right.Why are Cowgirl, a Viking, an alien invador, a Jungle Queen, a Knight, etc etc, warriors from different time periods all fighting? Simple they died and Vahalla is the afterlife in this universe or maybe multiverse, but the premise is fun and novel and I enjoy it. A dragon, a minotaur, an Archer with katars, a samurai, a ninja, a monster hunter.......Verdict: It is a fun game with good gameplay, presentation and lots of personality and it is free to play, though not paying will limit your legend choices weekly you can unlock them all eventually. 90 hours and I've unlocked about a third, but 20 buck isnt a lot for a game either so take your pick.Warning: This game is so fun you may never put it down, play at your own risk of having too much fun."

The All Legends Pack unlocks everything they'll ever make, and it was hands down the best purchase I've made - they've doubled the number of playable characters since I started.   The mini games are also loads of fun, from seasonal snowball fights to the regular bomb-charged versions.  This game is really underrated for the simple fun fighter it really is.

Also I dont hate the game, its pretty cool I guess, but nothing ever gets adressed with any of the characters or weapons. Axes can still hit through the ground SOMETIMES BUT NOT ALL THE TIME since its release as a weapon, Wu Shang or whatever his name is, still has really big long lasting hitboxes, and they still have 89 percent of all the specials hit behind you sometimes I guess.Also you wanna know the secret to get to diamond?Down light, side air. for every. single. weapon.EDIT:A recent update killed most of the spammy combos (down light side air is dead, thank god), changed a few hitboxes, and made some of the characters kinda good. It made the game more fun to play, and is entertaining to read the discussion page because of it. However its still not enough to change it to positive, it is a step in the right direction though.EDIT AGAIN:They added a stupid furry character for whatever reason, and the combos are back because people complained.

Like every other competitive online game if you don't play evryday you cannot keep up. I cannot stand this standard of online games. Either dedicate yourself completely or don't even bother. There has to be a middle ground. Why is it that people are not allowed to have fun when they play games. Why does it have to be a job?I play games to express myself in a fictional space, but you get into a game like this and you have to deal with social strata where you aren't allowed to get any enjoyment unless you are in the upper crust, and to get to the upper crust you have to pour blood sweat and tears. Don't get be wrong I am all for progression, I am all for skill. But I am sick and tired of paying for a game and then when I go to play it it slams it's♥♥♥♥♥in my face and says""no you don't deserve to have fun, you're not good enough"".Get gud they'll say. I was good, I used to have fun. I'm a damn founder, I baught this when it was in early access. Then I got bored and moved away from the game for a little while.

This is the land of shenanigans of silliness.I mean, where else can a viking, a space alien, and a minotaur fight it out? ...Well yeah, theres HotS... But that doesn't count.So anyway, what is the game like? It's word for word, a Smash Bros clone in terms of gameplay. You probably know the drill if you are an avid gamer. Punch someone until you somehow gain the power to punch em with enough force to make them explode. But just to spice things up is how the game handles items. You pick up a sword and instead of just changing a few of your attacks, your whole play style changes. It's honestly a nice shake up to the formula. I just wish I didn't keep forgetting that some directional attacks don't work(like, there is no neutral strong. I mean, there's no neutral smash in Smash bros, but I keep treating heavy attacks like Smash's special moves).Currently the big selling point is the game's pretty big character list at about 27 right now. There are plenty of game modes but besides snowbrall, strikeout, and the basic time and stock matches they aren't too much to write about unless you get some companions. A small issue I have is the lack of other items, but considering you can't pick up an item and a weapon I can see why there are so few of them.Personally, I'd recomend getting the All-Legends Pack if you want to just play this game. Twenty dollars is a fair enough price so long as you have internet or local friends.Or you could satisfy your cravings for bonus stuff with the Collectors pack. It's kind of expensive, but if you're the guy who really loves cosmetics the aproximate $100 worth of in game cash included with it is worth considering. Also you get a robot butler thing! Who doesn't love those?"

,Recommended,291550,29622642,Posted: 31 January,all,FUCKSLAP,"Legit fun. Grindy only if you're not willing to cough up the $20 for all the heroes. Even then, the rotation is forgiving and even for a new player such as myself, I managed to get a few wins in free for all. Winning doesn't make much of difference unless you're playing ranked.Each character has 2 weapons and an assortment of skills based on their weapon. Do note that the weapons have to be picked up in the match, BUT these weapons are plentiful. Although some skills seem to be static (IE if you have a spear and you up heavy attack in the air you'll always do a little helicopter spin and jump up more, if you're unarmed you all use the same basic and heavy attack.) none of the characters I played were boring and I would say at least 4/5 of them had skills that made me go ""oooo coool!!""If you like Super Smash Bros you'll enjoy this game. I highly reccomend using a controller if you want to play seriously. :)Very high potential."

Once all players are connected, you're given 4 minutes to knock players off the map or arena using  variety of weapons, from legend's weapons, to a throwable bomb. Attack combinations are possible, like jumpx2 --> down+heavy att, or just spam the f*** out :v. You start with bare hands, but eventually weapons will start spawning. You need to remember your legend look like because there's no pointer or gamertag above your legend so you need to keep track an eye on them. Winners are (of course) player with most knockouts. Once you win, you level up the legend you're playing, so you can't level up multiple legends.Overall the game is excellent. Need a while to get used with the controls. Multiplayer is not laggy (for me), and, it's fun knock people with a charged heavy attacks. They're like, ""Oh shet"" and I'm like, ""Surprise mothaf***a!"", but please add a ponter above the legend so I know where is my legend.Oh btw the (default) controls are:Z --> DashX --> Heavy attC --> Light att/Pickup weaponsV --> Throw ur weaponArrows --> Movement1-4 --> Taunt (Yes, not only TF2 has taunts)Tab --> Scoreboard"

It was a good game, just unfortunate about how they were quite ratchet towards my hattori skin! :( No biggy though! In the end, he said I was pro too, :DApart from some bad people in the community, Brawlhalla is defintely a game you should get! I honestly love it so much, it's probably one of my favourite games ever. It's so fun to play with friends too! Game devs definitely deserve a pat on the back, they've made such a fun and impressive game, that's free!! What more can you ask for?Also mentioning the fact that the DLC's are infact for cosmetic uses! No pay to win in this game :) (Possibly a sort of pay-to-win with the collectors pack, but honestly, I doubt that's an advantage, most people have 1-3 mains!)A lot of games are going to have bad people in the community! It's really hard to not fight back to the haters, but you're just going to have to get used to that. I'm sure they're nice on the inside!!!....10/10 would buy this game if it was a paid game :P"

The controller support in this game is the best, you can fight people online or try and be at the top by playing the single player tournament.Definitely, one of the best games to test your skills on.If you haven't played Brawlhalla, you should try it, you'll have the bext experience playing the game and it has a great amount of character to choose from with their own ability and skill set.Would I recommend? Highly! It proves how you can take a video game genre and be creative around that genre.Great game, great graphics, the best for live streaming video games."

Personally i have a set of responses to tilt people who are toxic towards me. To help the problem when i play a match against someone i'll either compliment them on something they did well or give them advice to do better.

With a low skillfloor, and being free to play, you can always play it with your friends on good servers lag-less, which is totally awesome.The strategies are more focused around the usage of items(mostly weapons), but they are designed in a balanced way, unlike smash bros. To define and enhance each characters' playstyle.On the competitive depth side, it might be because I didn't spend enough time on this game, but it seems like it's definitely inferior to smash bros: less punitive, overall, more recoveries. less simultaneous possibilities of attack, and the combos seems to be overall less technical than your typical smash bros fox/ness/Cpt. Falcon main.Some core mechanics like grabs are relying on the usage of weapons, and most heroes have the same playstyle when you don't have any weapons.Nevertheless, this game is still totally awesome, if what you're looking for here is to enjoy some fun time with friends, easily accessible, quick to learn, with still enough skill necessary to see the difference between players, this game is for you. You're gonna have a great time with your friends, no matter how bad they are at this kind of games."

I've invested alot of time into Brawlhalla because i love it so much. But despite all of this, I think that you guys really need to work on the ranking system. If theres one thing i absolutely hate is consistently getting matched up with people who are 100 or 200 elo higher than i am. It feels like everytime I break 1600 elo, I get matched up with someone 1750 or higher. Conversely, I get matched up with people 100 to 200 elo below me and end up pooping on them, thus continuing the vicious cycle of tilt. Although encountering this problem alot, I do sometimes have really great games with evenly skilled people and those are super duper fun. But where's the fun in being a Gold 4 getting matched up with Plat 4s and 5s and getting your booty hole mashed?"

This is because it is a lot of fun to play, but I suck at this game and there is actually no reason for me to give this ridiculous rating, crap....A 7.7 IT ISThere's different weapons in this game like the spear, the guns, the sword, the knives, the ridiculously fast and overpowered why do they exist in this game gauntlets, the hoe- I mean scythe, the lance, the battle axe and the hammer.SO THERE'S ALSO like 30 characters in this game because they slap different combinations of weapons on every character so they need lots of characters to get all the combinations. This game can be bought at the very steep price of $0,00. Now I know that may sound like a darn lot but just hear me out here. You can fight people in this. It's not only singleplayer. THAT'S RIGHT, you can ruin someone's day just by beating them in a silly round of spamming your one overpowered attack over and over again while dodging their attacks. DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN? Yeah that is why you must buy this, even at such a steep price. 7.7/10 not enough water.K BYE"

76561198031155706,Recommended,291550,29956993,Posted: 15 February,all,The Man of Brisk,"Do you like Super Smash Bros.?  Do you want a verison of Smash on PC?  If you answered ""yes"" to both of these questions, there's a very high probability that this game is for you.It's just as you would expect- do damage to your opponents and hit them hard enough to send them flying off the stage.Brawlhalla takes a unique approach to making its characters different from each other; all fighters have the exact same basic moveset, but each uses a different combination of weapons, including firearms, swords, spears, axes, scythes, and more (for example, Cross, a mobster, can use guns and gauntlets, the bandit Lucien uses guns and katars, the samurai Koji uses swords and bows, etc.) that they can pick up during a battle.  When equipped, their moves change to use the weapon they're holding- a regular attack that hits upward may now hit to the side using the same input, for example, so it's best to quickly learn what changes when you grab a weapon.  Other items, such as mines and spiked balls, appear, and you can throw these at opponents.While it may seem that the pool of heroes is just thrown together randomly, each fighter is given a distinct background explaining who they are, what they've done to become legendary, and what, if any, motives they have for participating in battles.  It's a nice touch to the fighters and makes them feel like they have presence; they're not cardboard.Functionally, the game is identical to Smash Bros., but there are noticeable differences to the gameplay.  For example, in Smash, you can hang off of ledges; this is not possible in Brawlhalla.  Instead, fighters will grip the walls and slowly slide down unless they jump off or attack, essentially dictating that players ""climb"" up.  While there's no percentage meter to show exactly how much damage a player has taken, a half circle suurounds a character's icon, starting at white but going to yellow to orange to red; the deeper the shade of red, the easier it will be to KO that player.  There isn't actually any way to shield or block attacks- the only defensive/evasive measure a player can use is a dash that renders them invulnerable for a very brief moment.  This dash can also be used to gain air, so it can be used to get back to the stage as well.  It cannot be spammed, so it must be executed wisely.Now let's talk about the Free-to-Play aspect.  The game is free to play, but without paying, you only get access to 6 of the now 30 fighters, with the 6 you can pick from changing every few days.  It's recommended you get the All Legends pack, which grants access to all fighters at any time, including any more that are added later.  That isn't a problem.  What IS an issue, however, is everything else.  With the All Legends pack, you have the meat of the game- the fighters- right there.  Anything extra, such as new skins, taunts, and even icons have to be bought using in-game currency, called Mammoth Coins.  The thing about that is that they cannot be earned through in-game means, you have to buy them.  I understand this is how the developers make their money from this game, but the prices for most extras cost large and perhaps ridiculous amounts of MCs.  For example, the minimum amount you can put towards MCs is $5.99, for 140 MCs.  Most extras cost around 100 MCs.  So you're basically paying 5$ for one taunt.  For one new skin.  For one PLAYER ICON.  There's even one KO animation that costs roughly $10.  Like I said, I know these are how the devs really make the revenue from this game, but those prices are just completely unreasonable.  I would stay away from those unless you REALLY play a specific character a lot and/or have money to burn.So, to recap:PROS--Gameplay like Smash Bros-Interesting characters-Fighters use different combos of weapons to define their playstyles-Fluid animation and framerate-Solid online play-Numerous game modes in addition to classic Sma- er, I mean, Brawlhalla-up to 8 players (good luck pulling that off though)CONS--Some weapons feel imbalanced, such as Scythes, which are new-Things like taunts, skins, KO animations, rescue parties, and even icons cost unreasonable prices of real money-Tactics such as camping and edgeguarding are much easier to pull off than in Smash-Music is only kind of ""eh""-The community can get quite toxic- insults like ""trash"" and ""f**got"" and ""n***er"" get thrown around a lot, especially in ranked battles no matter if the offender won or lostLuckily, the game is F2P, so you can always try it first before you sink any money into it, reasonable amounts or otherwise.  But I will tell you that Brawlhalla is worth getting at least the All Legends pack for."

While this game still has its flaws I think I'd totally reccomend it if you enjoy SSB or and of the platformer style fighters out there.

76561198290435442,Recommended,291550,30200886,Posted: 26 February,all,The swag,"After almost 200 hours of playing, I think I'm qualified to write a review of this game.MASSIVE DISCLAIMER: I give this game a thumbs up because of the game. But a lot of the game isn't the game. If this makes no sense, I mean the people who play the game are horrible. But the game itself is fun. So be warned, this game is very fun if you just play it with friends and NEVER take it seriously. Do that. If you do the opposite, playing against random people that are salty and take it too seriously, this game will become horrible. Please, remember this.DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU.TL:DR: Fun game, completely destroyed if you interact with the community. Besides me. I'm not salty.If you really want to read this massive wall of text, then go right ahead, though.Alright, let's get on with the real review now.There are many legends (Heroes that you fight against other people with, the two on the cover are brynn the angel and teros the minotaur) and they all have different weapon combinations. The weapons are as follows:Katars (Knife / shortsword looking things, focused on speed, weakness is damage.)Bow (All around.)Sword (Strength and weakness same as katars)Axe (Strength is damage, weakness is speed)Hammer (Weakness and strength same as axe)Gauntlets (Same as katars and sword, but a little less speedy and a little more damaging.)Scythe (It's just tricky. Speedy on some moves, damaging on others, it's really hard to say what it focuses on. It's the tricksters favorite weapon.)Spear (All around.)Rocket lance (Wide hitboxes, it's very hard to avoid. This one has no weakness, it's kinda unblanaced.)Blasters (I just flatout hate this one. I've played them a little bit though, and what drew me away from it was that they do a lot of damage, but are waaaaaaay too close range.)Let's look at the currency.Like every other F2P game in history, you pay real money to get some items that greatly increase your experience of this game. You can purchase Mammoth coins with real money to buy things. They are as follows:Legends (Also obtainble with currency that is obtained by playing, I will talk about that later)Sidekicks (Things that revive you when you die. You get one by default.)Taunts (Self explanatory. You get 1 by default.)Skins (Things that make legends look super cool.)Chest keys (Chests are well, chests that have skins inside them, if you open a chest you get a randomly generated skin. You cannot get a duplicate.)Podiums (Things that your legend stands on at the end of the round. I don't really think they matter, but you might find them cool. You get one by default.)Seasonal color schemes (Also obtainble with currency obtained by playing. These make your legend a certain mix of colors.)Avatars (Cool symbols under your IGN. A select few are obtainble by doing certain very difficult things, I will elaborate on this later. They are also displayed on the Taunt Avatar Flag.)KO effects (Little GIFS when you kill an opponent.)Item skins (Make the weapons you have look cool. If you buy a regular skin, it comes with 2 item skins in the legend skin's style.)2nd currency: Gold. (Obtain it by simply playing the game.)You can obtain Gold in a number of ways. One is by simply logging in every day. Another is doing the brawl of the week, a customized gamemode that gives you an extra 300 gold bonus for winning a certain number of times. Also known as TBOTW. You can also obtain it by doing daily missions, which require you to play a certain one of the legends you have by default that change weekly, which gives you a bonus of 125 gold. Of course, you also get gold by simply playing a match.  The last way to get gold is by leveling up. You gain EXP from playing matches so you level up eventually. You get gold no matter if you lose or win, but ofc you get more if you win. You can buy regular color schemes, legends, and rare seasonal avatars with gold.3rd and final currency: Glory. (Obtained from fighting in ranked combat.)This allows you to buy skyforged color schemes for legends, and skyforged + goldforged color schemes for weapons. I will now elaborate on this ranked combat thing.So, what the heck is this ranked combat thing?Ranked is a certain type of gamemode that wins you ELO when you win matches. If you lose a match in ranked, some of your ELO goes to your opponent. You can do a 1v1 match, or get a friend and earn a team score of ELO in ranked 2v2. Getting more ELO gets you higher ranked flags, from Emerald to Bronze to Silver to Gold (I'm currently at gold, it's pretty good) to Platinum to Diamond.When the ranked season ends, if you were at gold or higher, you get one of the avatars I mentioned earlier. You also get Glory. You must win 10 matches to get glory, and more and more match wins in ranked (To get glory you must compete in ranked combat) get you more glory. I got around 200 wins last season and ended up with around 7000 glory. I'm not sure of the exact Wins to Glory conversion, but it's out there on the internet if you are interested.There you have it. Brawlhalla in a nutshell. It may seem simple, but as you play it more and more, you'll start to really appreciate it. Unless you spend all your time playing random matches against other people instead of your friends. Then, it'll get so salty you'll feel like you drank a gallon of the dead sea. This also is in ranked. So to have the most fun, I say play custom matches with your friends, if you're going to touch ranked play ranked 2v2 (So much more fun than ranked 1v1) and you'll enjoy yourself.Congrats if you read this far, I hope this helped. If I said something amusing, maybe rate it funny, or if I was helpful, give it a thumbs up. GL out there, and beware of the salt."

,Not Recommended,291550,30245336,Posted: 28 February,all,Warper,"Game is great till you realize that the meta is SPAMMING ♥♥♥♥ing dodge cuz you cant tech for♥♥♥♥♥♥ Thats all this game is spamm power attacks and spam dodge. Game is absolutely not balanced. every ♥♥♥♥ing new character they have is broken. Then you get memers that pick the most broken characters and just sit and spam power attacks. Its sad that gimmick style works in this game. Skill ceiling is low af.EDIT: Came back to the game after many months of not playing and it seems like they still havent fixed the fkn hitboxes. Game is complete TRASH. Id rather go spend the money to buy a gamecube, ssbm, and a gamecube controller than pay however much this trash is worth. Funny part is they are having a tournament. They chose to have a tournament with broken HUGE hitboxes where you can just spam your power move and suck the other player in? like i said before LOW SKILL CEILING. you can get good at this game in a matter of hours. Complete trash game. Dont buy unless you want to casually play. 1v1 is out of the question because its a game of who can dodge the most and who can get map control and spam their power attack. Just buy super smash bros if you are gonna spend money. Dont waste it on this♥♥♥♥♥♥ass game. Seriously."

,Recommended,291550,29436337,Posted: 22 January,all,5DollarFootLong,"I have played this game for a while now and I have decided to make a honest review on how I feel about this game. In all of the free games I have played on steam this by far has to be the best game. However with this game being free the devs need to make money somehow so they make there in-game purchases insanely high. But there are no pay to win items in this game, only cosmetic items (Which I appreciate). I would recommend buying the in-game purchases/DLC's if you want to support the devs and the game as a whole. With the game still in beta updates are always happening which is a good and a bad thing. With new updates cool skins are added which are still overpriced however. But when a new character is added it usally is a character that is very broken or spammy and is used in mostly every match you play in until a new character that is just as broken is added. This isn't all of the devs fault however they need to fix this. Also sadly this game has a terrible community of players. After most competitive games you mostly get called a spammer if you win and if you lose you just get trash talked. Also after a while of playing competitive matches or free-for-alls the game gets very boring and repetitive. It would be great if the developers could add more fun and exciting gamemodes. With all that being said this game has many flaws however is still a fantastic game and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fun and free game to play."
