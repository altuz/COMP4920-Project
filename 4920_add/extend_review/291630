But for a full price I think it's too short (about two hours without even using a hints). Overall the game is fun and sometimes even pretty challenging but don't be afraid you'll never get frustrated because of the hint system and ability to skip puzzles (even thought there are only a few of them).Pros:-Fun and relaxing-A few challenging objects (but if you don't want a challenge you can always use a hint)-Nice and simple story that ties the game together-Cheesy voice acting (I think it fits into this type of game)Cons:-Too short (for a full price)-Some objects are hidden in a really cheap way

Some of them can't be obtained before gathering other items in other locations. And that's what you will do everytime: find objects, place some on the scene because they're missing, head to another location, repeat the same thing and solve one or two puzzles thrown at you.While this gameplay is interesting, I had a major problem: some items are so hard to find because they're partially hidden by the end of the screen or they're so well matched with the background that you don't see them. However, you have a visual indicating that it can be found as they're not in grey and as the game doesn't tell you that you're done with the location. And sometimes, some of the active areas aren't really highlighted, meaning that you don't know what to do in the scene. After a while, it's boring and frustrating.Even if the plot makes sense, I would have expected more background on the mirror or on the worlds you're travelling to. You end up running from the mansion with the kids, which is expected but you don't know nothing about the mirror.The graphics are acceptable though I found them a little too... dead. I mean that I was under the impression that there was like a grey filter on nearly each location and I find that it was adding frustration to find items. The soundtrack and voice acting is ok, particularly the voice of the mirror.I know that Mirror Mysteries isn't a recent hidden object game, however, I feel like that there are better out there. I didn't really enjoy this one and I'm wondering how the sequel will be, if there is any improvement. Anyway, sadly, for Mirror Mysteries, it's a big no from me. I suggest you to look at other games, like Mystery P.I. or Mystery Case Files."

If I wanted a regular hidden object game without substance I'm sure I could find a lot of free ones online.The set up has you thinking it's going to be a great story, a mom's journey to find and save her two children . . . so far playing the first level I feel more like a house cleaner, finding items to straighten up stuff when her main goal is suppose to be fixing a clock.   You're children are being held captive until you fix a mirror and you're going to go about calmly sorting things instead of sticking to the task that will most likely free them?

Full price it's not worth it, but at a discount it can be put on swiftly for a coffee break.

The break a mirror, and it's your job to retrieve the pieces and repair the mirror - the rest I'll leave for you to find out.The graphics are decent - and present well.

I picked it up with the sale so for a game that may sell full price at the standard $9.99 or bit less at $1.24 I was satisfied with the fun I had.I will say the voice acting was enjoyable though I found myself laughing after a few times when the mom speaks.The V.A's for the most part each had their own personality and it didnt' feel like the V.A's were just reading from a script as I felt at least they put an effort in having a personality behind the voice.If you like to play just a small casual game like this then try it while it's on sale or wait for it to be included in a bundle where it may be even less.So for what it is I""d say 1 1/2 to maybe 2 stars.Also if you have young kids I think this would be a pretty good choice for them.Also I think it will show my playtime shows 3.7 hours however I often keep games up even if I am not actually playing so if I was to play this without breaks I think it's a game that can be finished in about 2hrs.So I'd say this is shorter game ( average standard editions games I think are about 3-4hrs).Happy gaming~"

Personally, I prefer FROGs over HOGs, so I might be a little biased in recommending the game. If you really like the genre, you may give this a try. If not, look elsewhere.In any case, don't buy this at full price. It isn't worth it. I bought it at a big discount, and I feel I got my money's worth.The game in detail:# It has only one game mode. It's fairly easy, and the hint button recharges quickly. There's a random clicking penalty, that doesn't really do much (you can still click; it just makes the screen harder to see).# The graphics are decent, but not amazing. The HO scenes are clear, and the objects are big enough to be spotted. There's a magnifying glass feature, that I didn't use at all.# It's quite short. It took me just 1.5 hours to finish it, and I read all the dialogues.# I've encountered one bug: Whenever a steam message (like ""Friend X did Y"") popped up, the screen went black. The game didn't crash, though. Minimizing the game and maximizing it again fixed the issue - until the next message showed up.# The story isn't very engaging. Some evil mirror trapped your kids, and you have to save them by retrieving missing mirror pieces. It felt quite bland to me, but it wasn't too bad.

I've played way more than I care to admit, and this game is among the worse ones I've played. It's very short, for one, and is also by far the easiest I've ever played. The hidden object scenes can often be completed without even looking at the items you need to find because they just don't blend in. I don't know if there's some kind of drop shadow or what exactly makes it obvious, but I could just easily pick them out. There's also way too much hand-holding with a pop-up telling you when you're out of things to do at that scene. There's no logic involved at all. I never had to ask myself, ""Okay, so I found this item. What scene had a problem I haven't solved where I might need something like this?"" You're given numbers telling you which scenes still need actions and if you pick the wrong scene, a popup tells you you've already done all you can there, instantly narrowing down your choices. I really didn't like that at all. There are also maybe 3 actual puzzles at most. I should mention I always play these games on Casual difficulty, as I enjoy them only to mindlessly pass time when I'm stressed, and even so I found this too easy.The graphics were also very pixelated when set to fullscreen. This is my first time playing a hidden object game on a PC instead of my phone, though, so I don't know if perhaps that is the standard.The only real upside is that the music was enjoyable. It's the first time I've ever noticed the music while playing, though that may be due in part to the fact that I wasn't mentally engaged.Bottom line: don't pay full price. My rule of thumb is to try and get 1 hour of gameplay per dollar. I got this on sale, so I came out close to even, but don't buy this for $5."

This game is VERY VERY SHORT and as such, not worth the full price.That said, the hidden object puzzles are set up in a more unique way than some and I found it pretty engaging.  The scenes weren't horrifyingly difficult nor were they very simple.  I prefer when these games make me work for it a little bit.There were some minor annoyances.  Plot was flimsy at best, characters were not even remotely fleshed out or interesting, and for some reason all of the cut scene dialog is in capital letters; generally I don't expect really excellent plot or character development from straight HO games, though, so it doesn't faze me overly much.  You might have other ideas.So anyway, this game barely squeaks by with a recommendation from me, and as I already said, get it on sale.

There are a few other 'minigames' which only takes a few clicks to get through. This game is all about the hidden objects.You play a mother who finds her kids missing when she wakes up from a nap outside an old house. She enters the house to find that a mirror has taken her children because they destroyed his mirrors. The mother now has to go to all the mirror worlds and fix problems (mostly cleaning up) to get mirror pieces from the characters in each world to put all the mirrors together again and get the kids back.I enjoyed each of the small mirror worlds, each world has 4-5 scenes with some backtracking, but only within the specific world. You can jump to the world map at any time and you'll get a message saying you are done with the scene either 'for now' or 'completed' so you'll spend no time looking for extra stuff.Short game, 2 h playtime without skipping/hinting much. Some objects are hidden so far out the side of the screen/behind other items that you see only such a small part of it that it can be hard seeing that it is the item you're looking for.I liked the voiceacting of the main character and most other characters in the game.

You will get about 2 hours of gameplay.I found it slightly grinding after the first couple levels, as its the same thing over and over. I was hoping for more puzzles and different games to be played to mix up the constant looking for things. The tutorial does a good job teaching you what to do and how to do it, and if your ever frustrated at not finding certain well hidden items, there is a hint button you can press to reveal the next item.The main reason I am not recommending this game is that the price is much too high for so little content, 12$ is incredibly high for only 2 hours of gameplay, and holds zero replay value (this changes if you have kids or other friends and family members who like these games and can play them on your account) for most people. Its worth 5$ for what you get, the price tag is just too high. Thankfully I got the game for 1$ on a mega sale last summer, so it was worth the 2 hours.Personal Rating: 2.5/5"

Fans of the genre would enjoy it, but It is quite short, so they'll probably race through it very quickly. Take that into consideration if you're going to pay full price for this game.An annoying limitation is that the resolution is locked low.

I don't usually pay too much attention to plots in these types of games, but there is a strange disparity in tone. A woman's children are stolen away by a well-voiced and sinister antagonist. However, the mother does not seem to be too upset about having to earn her kids back. Then there's a goofy mouse inside a clockwork; he sounds like a character from a fun children's story but is a little out of place here. And this is just in the beginning. However, if you enjoy fairly basic HOGs, I would recommend purchasing this one at a sale price as I did. The art and music are nice."

The Art seemed very good, and the voice acting was decent given what I felt was a lack of a really solid story.  I found the whole premise that a family on a road trip to somewhere to out of the blue decide to take a picnic at a spooky abandoned house really far fetched. Mostly between a banter between the psuedo badguy and the heroine there is not much dialogue. Overall I enjoyed the game.  Would I reccomend this game? Certainly  If like me you like Hidden Object games.  There is little to no replay value and you could probably burn through it in 2 hours depending.  I wish for achievements and trading cards which this title is lacking but not a reason to not buy this game.  Based on my impression of this game I may plan on playing the sequel to this title."

76561197978350645,Recommended,291630,16732610,"Posted: 26 June, 2015",all,lionhart,"For some reason I like this little hidden objects game enough to have played it all the way through three times. The thing is, it's not even a good HOG -- the graphics are dated, the story is lame, and it's nowhere near as sophisticated as the recent HOGs by Artifex Mundi or Silverback. So why do I like it? Let's see if we can figure this out:- It's short; you can finish it in under two hours. Some people would say this is a negative, but I appreciate the fact that you can complete it in one sitting.- It's easy; the graphics are big and cartoonish, and you can find most of the hidden objects just by clicking on anything that looks out of place. Again, this could be viewed as a negative, but when I choose to play a HOG I am not looking to be mentally taxed, at all.- You see pictures of the objects you are supposed to find, rather than a word list. Not only does this make the game even easier, but you don't have to waste any time trying to figure out if a 'nut' is supposed to be an almond or a piece of hardware.- The hidden object scenes are logical. That is, they're not just random collections of weird items that have nothing to do with each other. The objects all belong in the scene, but they are out of place. For example, a typical task is to find some buttons scattered around the room and sew them back on to a jacket, or find all the pieces of a broken stone column and then repair it. You actually feel like you are accomplishing something as you work on each scene and restore it to order.- The game doesn't do anything especially well, but it doesn't do anything especially wrong, either. The music is decent (or at least not annoying), the voice acting is decent (or at least not annoying), and the heroine is nice to look at.So there you have it. Mirror Mysteries is not going to make anyone's top ten list, but if you can get it cheap on sale, and if you have a mindless hour or two to kill before bedtime on a Thursday night, it fits the bill perfectly."

It has the suggestion of  ""spookiness,"" but is totally ""G"" rated for kids and sensitive folks.  I agree with another reviewer that it ""doesn't overstay its welcome,"" which is not always the case with HOG games. There are very few puzzles; in that sense, it feels a bit unbalanced.  However, the game is a good choice for settings when there are distractions, as it  doesn't require much concentration or timed responses.Because Mirror Mysteries is so short, with little replay value, I would suggest buying it when it is on sale.  At worst, it's a nice little break from more challenging games."
