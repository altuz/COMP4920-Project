76561198000387937,Not Recommended,291710,12815523,"Posted: 6 November, 2014",all,Sir Valence,"I thought long and hard about whether or not to give this a thumb down/negative rating because I hate kicking independant developers and this isn't actually a bad game but a flawed one. However, since there are (at time of writing) so many reviews and comments heaping praise on this game (and even calling it a masterpiece), I figured a negative rating would probably get more people to read this review and consider some of the poorer aspects of this game before buying it.FIRSTLY LET ME ACKNOWLEDGE THE GAME'S FINER POINTS. The artistic design is excellent. The stylistic grey and white with splashes of colour is a great device for delineating supernatural vs ordinary events. It makes use of the night vision camera all the more spectacular. The setting of an isolated english town steeped in history and pagan beliefs is very good too. In fact, as a premise for a game the whole thing sounds perfect; explore a spooky town with ghostbusting gadgets, solving mysteries and vanquishing evil. What could go wrong? A fair amount, it turns out.For a start, it's slow. Painfully, bloody slow - even for a point and click. You can double click for quicker movement but it doesn't work everywhere and you have to sit there and watch the player character, Nigel, slowly glide across the screen or perform an animation at a slugs pace. Meanwhile, you're sitting there grinding your teeth in frustration. It also takes a while to get the ghost-hunter gadgets so I reckon a lot of people may probably give up before the game gets interesting.Oh, have I mentioned that Nigel comes across as being stupid. Well, he does. He just seems to react (or not react at all) to things so strangely. He's like those characters in horror movies that trip over things that aren't there and you're kind of glad when they get killed. He's also voiced poorly (by the game's creator) so his response to characters, ghosts and events in the game can be so odd and jarring that he is quite unlikeable. For example, there are a couple of times in the latter part of the game when pebbles are hurled by ghosts at his head and hit the camera - absolutely no response! I wanted Nigel to die. I really did.The game also isn't scary/spooky enough. There are one or two genuinely creepy moments and a couple of jump scares but that's about it so it really shouldn't be described as a horror title.Look, I don't want to completely trash this game and dissuade people from playing it. I repeat, it's not bad, just flawed. Just take my criticisms under consideration. If you're ok with slow games and/or love point and click adventures, then grab this game. Maybe wait for a sale!???One last thing; some STEAM ACHIEVEMENTS are buggered (they certainly didn't unlock for me) and according to the discussion forums, you may need to tamper with the game files to get them to unlock.UPDATE: For whateverer reason, this review seems to float at the top of postings and has garnered a few critiques of it's own. Some people seem to superficially misunderstand the first paragraph here as a petulant or contrarian stance against positive reviews of tLC. To be clear, I wrote that WHOLE first paragraph to openly outline my bias and to address the fact that STEAM ONLY ALLOWS BINARY POSTIONS OF THUMB UP OR DOWN. It's that simple.I stand by my brief review in almost every respect. It's not terrible but it's not great. The flaws tend to drag the game down the further it goes on. A few people won't mind this but most will! Adventure-game fans will probably love tLC but I can't give it a general endorsement of thumbs up.I hereby drop my mic."

I played it a long time ago, and it was decent enough.- Voice acting is kind of meh, however the town and it's denizens are plenty eerie.- A lot of black and white with splashes of color.- Touches of Lovecraft here and there..- What was going on with the cats is pretty screwed up...- If you like Scratches, the Darkfall series, the Black Mirror series, or the Darkness Within series, you'll probably enjoy this."

The first time i bought it i wasn't sure about the black and white coloring, but i'm SO glad i was able to look past something that was *seemingly dull. After playing it, it became one of my absolute favorites; It's layered with disturbing tales and eerie sounds that Jonathan Boakes' games are famous for. You won't forget this unique experience, especially the people of Saxton, those both dead AND alive."

Such tales - particularly if they are well-delivered - can raise the hairs on your neck and send chills down the spine. The Lost Crown: A Ghost-hunting Adventure is steeped heavily in the folklore intrigue of the spirit world rather than the full-on gore and flesh eating creatures found in horror games, but it still delivers a winding story full of scary moments and interesting twists. It's a creepy game that dabbles equally in aspects of ghost-hunting, searching for ancient treasure, and old fashioned detective work. If you're into ghosts, you'll love digging into this haunted adventure mystery set on the fog-laden coast of England."

Great story, atmospheric sound and music.Get used to hearing ""Thats not right!""The long version:NEGATIVESMy first instincts after 5 minutes of playing was to turn it off and burn my computer including the building it resides in.The reason for this is the first negative for the game.The movement is painfully slow, you can speed this up in most places (not all but most) by double clicking the exits.This is by far the biggest downside of this game and to be fair is due to a limitation of the game engine I am guessing.The other negative for me was the voice overs, the people who do the voices are clearly amateurs and it shows in places, some of the dialogue sounds wooden and doesnt show enough emotion in places, on the whole its more a small niggle as you can tell that the people were passionate about this game at least which for me made up for it and for the most part the voice overs are fine, some are clearly better than others and its only here and there you can tell that the people doing the voices arent proffesionals, it didnt bother me much but I have read lots of comments about this so thought I would mention it.It reminded me of an amatuer dramatic society reading through a script if that makes sense.They are the only two negatives for me personally.POSITIVESThis is not a game for impatient people, it is a game to play lesuirely and absorb yourself within the village of Saxton.I found myself hooked on the story after the obvious glaring bad points of the gameIt is a point and click game, you cannot use the keyboard at all, it is a supernatural mystery set in a fictional town in the south west of England and has a lot of text based information building a history of the town and the surrounding areas.It does not hold you hand, I had to use a walkthrough guide two or three times but some people will struggle less/more depending on your patience.It is a slow paced game at first but does start to smoothly progress after the in game day one which I urge you to perservere with as it does get better and the game world does open up to more locationsThe story itself is very well written and thought out with seemingly fragmented stories all slowly evolving to make sense.The sound and the music is exceptionally used, it is not over used and totally fits the game.The graphics really is just a lot of stills that have very good monochrome detail and seem to basically be converted real photos for the most part.I whole heartedly recommend this game to people with patience and want a story driven game to make you think, I cant really define this into a genre but the world needs more games like this,(if anyone behind the game reads this, I would like to be involved in any projects you guys work on, I will not state why or what i could do here, just message me if you are seeking help at all)Do not be discouraged by the general look of the game, although if you have played point and click games then it wont be a total shock to you, it is not a hidden object or puzzle game at all, you will not find silly puzzles for the sake of it, every aspect of the game is logical and relevent.If you are interested in this game based on this review then I encourage you to not read anything more about the game but to simply dive in, it is after all a mystery at its heart, there are a few definite horror moments but its more of a mystery than a horror gameRELATING TO PREVIOUS GAMESHaving played and completed the two dark fall games I can state that the order of play for the three games doesnt much matter, there are small snippets that long the games but they are subtle and you will not have any spoilers for other games if playing them out of order, the lost crown is smoother and easier to play too, the team seem to have relaxed the difficulty a little compared to the dark fall games which in places could be very frustrating.Thats all from me, go buy and play this little gem!"

Unlike anything else entirely.Absolutely to be forgiven of such painfully endearing floors as 'poor' voice acting, obtuse puzzles and slow animations. If you like adventure games play this on a week off school/work and preferably with a friend. Turn off your phone, minimize distractions, have snacks/ready meals on standby and settle in.Its floors (which are definite by any objective standard) make it loveable and unique. It is somewhat slow, misshapen and brutally clunky... but this is a one-man band we're talking about! Jonathan Boakes has done a singularly fantastic job making this game. I cannot stress enough how worth it this game is.If I had never played this I would pay around £15 on a punt to see if it was worth it because I like the genre. After having played it I would gladly pay £100 or more because it is honestly unparalleled (okay, that sounds rediculous, but it's honestly true.)I will not give away anything about the game because saying anything about it at all would be unfairly taking it out of context, something to which this game is vitally important. I will say however that the voice acting is preposterous, the opening cutscene is cringeworthy, and the constant appeal to 'what is scary', dumb - but none of this matters. The 'bad' points about this game become almost instantly charming; the atmosphere will win you over.The story is for the most part intruiging, the puzzles a mixture of challenging and twee, but the atmosphere... oh the atmosphere. Scary? Yes. Creepy? Certainly. Beautiful? Absolutely!You will be greatly rewarded for sticking this game out. A true independent masterpiece for anyone who is even tangentially interested in adventure games.P.S. The best part is, Boakes is already a decent way through making the next game in the series and there's an interim installment in the series called Midnight Horror!"

I quit mid-game upon its initial release because of the slow pace. I was forced to watch EVERY step Nigel took to look at an object, or reach an exit-point. I had to listen to every word of dialogue - even if I had heard it a dozen times before. And this is a 20+ hour game!I'm thrilled to find that I can now jump to the next screen, skip dialogue, and finally play through this intriguing, haunting story. If The Lost Crown tried your patience in 2008, this is the answer to your prayers :)"

But once that's over, this game is fantastically atmospheric.  The settings are wonderfully immersive and memorable.  The art style -- which seems like another puzzling choice at first -- rapidly grows on you until it you realize that it's perfect.  The use of color in this game is almost worth the purchase price itself.  This game is an unusual experience, but that's exactly what makes it stay with you for so long."

I had been wondering when/if this one would come to steam, and lo and behold it did!This one is worth playing for point-and-click enthusiasts. The visuals are quite nice, being largely based upon photographs, with some low-detail 3D models thrown in. The black and white aesthetic can be stunning at times.Unlike many games, it really takes the time to thoroughly develop its setting and the characters within it.Some puzzles can be a bit cryptic, many may need a walkthrough at some points.Overall, to any fans of adventure games, I highly recommend it."
,Recommended,291710,13335421,"Posted: 12 December, 2014",all,eevil.auntie,"Creepiness level: a couple of very mild jumpscares, some gore and animal cruelty, a whole lot of suspense and oppressive atmosphere. Most of the spooky stuff is conveyed through hints in dialogue and text fragments, as well as through environment and sound design, so there's not a lot of on-screen violence or anything.Difficulty level: I think there are only two timed puzzle/action sequences, you can take your time with everything else, and you can't die in this game. The slow pacing and easy point-and-click mechanics are perfect for anyone with slow reflexes or coordination problems. People have complained about Nigel's slow walking - the Steam version allows double-clicking for faster screen transitions, which minimizes the time spent just watching Nigel trudge around. It's still not a game for fans of fast-paced action, but personally I found myself deliberately slow-walking through many scenes, to better immerse myself in the atmosphere.Only minus point for tiny cursor and no hotkey for highlighting interactable items - in some scenes I had to check a walkthrough to see if there was another item a couple of pixels apart from items I'd already clicked through (and there usually was). The directional arrows are also sometimes confusing.As a completist gamer I'm also grumpy about the problems with the Steam achievements. I spent a lot of time trying to unlock everything, but had to give it up as a lost cause (there was nothing more I could try short of playing the entire game through in German, which apparently fixes the achievement bugs).I've previously played Jonathan Boakes's Dark Fall trilogy, and while I enjoyed those, The Lost Crown is superior both visually and in maintaining a consistent atmosphere. By now I've come to the conclusion that as a writer, Boakes excels in creating mysteries you want to keep following through, and that makes the games very addictive. He's not good at endings, though. All four games of his I've played so far have ended in a way that's abrupt and anticlimactic. But that used to bother me more than it does now - the endings are unimportant compared to the interconnected worldbuilding underlying his games. The layers of mythology, science and science fiction, different time periods and recurring themes really start to pay off once you've played several of his games. I'm looking forward to Boakes's future projects and to finding out more about the mysterious Hadden Industries."

First to notice is b&w photography stylization, which is creepy from the beginning. Later on, when you discover the foggy little coastal town of Saxton a little better, it becomes more and more suggestive, almost hypnotic.It's a game with probably the slowest tempo I know. And it's also very long. Like endless drowning in the swamps around the town. Many people could probably find it unbearable, but for me it's important part of it's charm. Wandering the streets or countryside around town, getting to know it's inhabitants and their stories, is beautiful. And despite tempo, actual ghosthunting in the sinister Saxton's atmosphere can be pretty thrilling.Unique experience, but be carefull with this one."
,Recommended,291710,16086608,"Posted: 30 May, 2015",all,shiaakuma,"Oh how I dearly love this game.  It's not perfect, there are definite flaws, but overall I find it a great addition to my library.On the plus side:  graphically beautiful, with photo-real settings in monochrome with occasional bright dashes of color that really enunciate the scenes.  Character graphics may be considered a little dated now, but nothing terrible.  Music and sound work well.  Voice acting overall is good and believable with the exception of Nigel, who has a sort of strange Shatnerian pace to his lines which could also be the result of botched sound editing rather than strange voice acting.  I've heard people complain that the voice acting is bland overall, but I disagree; I like that the characters have believable tone and cadence rather than hamming it up (melodrama ruins immersion).The biggest plus is naturally the story, which is deep and compelling and doesn't spoon-feed information.  There is a lot of opportunity for the player to form their own theories and explanations for some of the strange events; however, if you are the type that prefers definitive black-and-white explanations, you may be frustrated by some of the questions that are only loosely addressed and left to you to form your own opinions on.The ghost-hunting part of the game with a full Ghost Hunters set of equipment is really fun in my opinion, but I also suck up episodes of GH and Ghost Adventures like some people drink water, so I could be biased there.  I really enjoyed snapping pictures and listening to EVP playbacks, which ranged from blatant clues to added plot points.The neutrals:  the pace is slow.  The story, like many point-and-click adventure games, doesn't rely on fast action and jumpscares to progress.  Rather, it slowly builds the story (and substories) into a cohesive narrative.  I don't find the pace too slow, personally, as I prefer having the crap scared out of me in a slow, chilling way instead of a jumpscares-constantly-cause-startling-people-is-fun way.  However, if you like fast action and immediate gratification, you may not like this one.The negatives: going back to pace, your player character, Nigel, moves GLACIALLY slowly.  There is a doubleclick-to-move-faster option that works most of the time, but you do have to wait for him to get ""in position"" on each screen before moving to the next even with the doubleclick.  Since this game utilizes a fairly huge game world, this gets irritating relatively quickly.  For me personally, it doesn't break the game, it's just an annoyance to keep in mind.Some puzzles, as in most point-and-click games, are not as intuitive as you might want, but if you're a fan of the genre, you won't have too much trouble.  Puzzles are definitely less abstract than some other games I've played.The other complaint I see is about the broken achievements; while most work, there are a handful that only work in the German language version of the game.  There are directions in the forums for how to access these achievements with a minimum of fuss if you're a crazed achievement hunter (like me!).  While this is a definite negative, it does not in any way impact actual gameplay, and won't affect you at all if you're not ""into"" achievements.So overall, I recommend the game.  The negatives aren't negative enough to overwhelm all the positives, and the $10 asking price is completely reasonable given the substantial depth and length of the game.  I've played through twice since purchasing and will likely return to it again in the future for my scary, ghost-hunting fix."

But the atmostfear and the soundtrack in the game gives you the chill. You, as the main character gets to investigate paranormal activity, which is the following ghost. The grapic is pure lovely. This is one of my most favorite point and click games ever. The game is quite long, as you may need some walkthrough to get past the whole game. But the story in this game you have to capture while you are still around. Most part of the game is black and white. But there are a few color in the game, which makes it more interesting. Be sure to play it at night with great headset.Don't let the grapics of the characters fool you. I promise you, as you keep playing it, it will make you want to discover more.

I'm not quite sure what it is.  Partly, I know, it's that they tend to be a tad pedantic with the puzzle-solving and/or just a little too ♥♥♥♥ing ""clever"" for the dumb-arsed likes of me, but another part of it is...I'm not sure, but I suspect there's something about the whole interface which just doesn't resonate for the most part.  With few exceptions, I'm also not that terribly fond of turn-based strategy games, so perhaps it's something to do with the unnaturally ""static"" natures of such games.  I won't deny for a second that most of my favourite games tend to be fairly ""cinematic"" in nature, and if an equivalent term could be applied to these point-and-clickers, the word ""literary"" perhaps springs to mind.  Certainly less visceral and ""immediate"" in their audio-visual thrills; perhaps even requiring a bit more ""imagination"" on the player's behalf, rather than just serving it all up on a silver platter to be easily consumed.The Lost Crown is certainly anything but an ""action-packed"" or ""fast-moving"" game, at least as far as I've played it.  In fact, I think it would be safe to say that unless you find its storyline as compelling and immersive as some evidently have, it downright PLODS.  Perhaps it's very ""English"" in that way, I'm not sure.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing...it's certainly preferable to a Michael Bay movie, a phenomenon which is comparatively very ""American"", in the worst possible way.  Maybe that's the thing with point-and-click games for me...I WANT to like them, because they represent an ideal which I would like to support; that of INTELLIGENCE and TASTE, in favour of just making♥♥♥♥♥♥BLOW UP.  But...and I hate to say this, and I'm sure some of you will hate me for saying this...but maybe...just maybe...video games, to some extent, NEED to be about more primal things like, well, ""blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up"".  Again, I'm not sure.  Or maybe I just feel that if you're going to indulge in what is, just like a movie, a fundamentally ""audio-visual"" medium, perhaps you need to take full advantage of the strengths of said medium and create a predominantly audio-visual experience.  Which, all things considered, point-and-click games basically DON'T.Some people hate these games for being so ""old-school"" and ""retro"", and basically believe the medium should have died out a good decade or two ago.  Other people LOVE these games for PRECISELY THE SAME REASONS.  I guess I'm somewhere in between, and while I appreciate the great lengths The Lost Crown has gone to to evoke an interesting atmosphere and tell a quite possibly interesting yarn - I love a great ghost story, no doubt about that - unfortunately the glacial pacing and pedantic talk-to-everyone-and-examine-absolutely-everything gameplay left me a little uninspired.  And let's not forget the main protagonist, who may look a bit like Simon Pegg but is entirely bereft of said man's charm; he's an insufferably rude, borderline belligerent♥♥♥♥♥♥ truth be told.  I found myself constantly bemused that the other characters didn't just slap him in the face and walk the other way, the condescending little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!  Which isn't to say that I found many of the other characters terribly charming either...eccentric, yes, but not much else.  It's all just a bit...odd, and...awkward.  There's no doubt Mr Jonathan Boakes is an interesting and talented game-maker, but if he's responsible for the dialogue and/or any of the voice acting in this game, he should probably learn to be just a tad less stubbornly ""independent"" in his future endeavours.None of which is to say that The Lost Crown isn't successful in being something very different and even somewhat intriguing, it's just...well, I'm only a few hours in, almost ♥♥♥♥-all has happened, and apparently the game lasts a good thirty-plus hours and has plans of being sequelized, so...sigh...I'm gonna have to opt out for now, perhaps wait 'til I age another decade or two, then come back to it in the hopes that I will have ""slowed-down"" enough to better appreciate the paint-peeling pace which it seems so determined to maintain.  On the other hand, should Mr Boakes ever choose to widen his horizons/lower his standards and make a full-blown ""survival horror"" (read: action/adventure) game, I'm there with bells on.  This just wasn't the game for me, I'm afraid.  I will, however, heartily recommend it to anyone with far more patience than I apparently possess...just don't expect a non-stop-thrills/rollercoaster-ride of a game - quite the opposite, really - and you may find much to love.  Each to their own, no accounting for tastes, etc etc, ad nauseam...Verdict: 7/10."

There are so few examples of games treating this subject with any seriousness or artistry that The Lost Crown is worth playing for that alone.Aside from that, it has plenty of flaws, well documented elsewhere, and I needed a walkthrough for a couple of obscure puzzles, but it is all pretty tolerable. The ghost hunting aspects are not central to the game, but the theme of historical and supernatural investigation is, and gives this game a unique atmosphere. I found the art style to be a little strange at first, but grew on me a lot during my playthrough, to end up one of my favourite aspects of the game.People who are interested in the specific subjects and themes of the game will get the most from it."

This game renewed my faith, although it can be be it bit irritating at the beginning, mainly due to getting a handle on the movement (thankfully steam have increased the movement speed, otherwise you would be moving at a snails pace).Once you get over the movement & the slight confusion of the B&W graphics, thats it you are hooked, apart from being what I class as a very pretty game, The storyline is addictive you find that you have to know more.. The paranormal aspect is well thought out & at times will make you jump.. I found playing in the dark with headphones was the way to go.. Thankfully it is a decent length..

This is the reality of that worldPlay it in a darkend room. ...and keep the speakers up.I first heard about this game when I became interested in Ghost Hunting TV shows. I was hoping for a true ghost hunt game (which i would love to see happen some day). What i did get is a great point and click adventure game by Jonathan Boakes, creator of the Darkfall series. If you havent played any of his older games, check them out sometime.It is so nice to see that adventure games are still making themselves known and this is one of my favorites since the golden age of  Sierra adventures.Like I said in the intro. this is fun and spooky. Not scream and run out of the room but enough to give you a good creepy feelingBest part for me, is that you do get ghost hunting equipment. There are areas where you get to utilize them not only to find paranormal activity but to also help solve puzzles as you continue your story.Put yourself into the shoes of the main character. Believe that you are stuck in this odd, colorless and sometimes foggy sea-side village. That is the best way to enjoy this game.I heard that ths is the beginning of a new series by Jonathan Boakes about The Crown. I am looking forward to the next.Someone asked me if the game runs in 16:9 1920 x 1080. When I got my first widescreen monitor, the original version of the game would not adapt to it. I ended up with a stretched out version of the screen and no way to adjust for the wider screen.I would have beeen happy if i could at least have black bars on the side of the screen so the scenes didn't look squashed.This version does that. The game was not made for wide screen. The steam version has a option  to maintain the aspect ratio of the game when you press start, giving you the black bars on the side. This made me very happy.I run it at 16:9 1920 x 1080 , put a check in the box for maintain aspect, run it at full screen and it runs great."

It packs just the right amount of horror and story to keep you interested, with just the right mood to keep you clicking along. The story is rife with a number of twists, surprises, and yes, sometimes, scares, though for the most part the scares aren't of the jumpscare variety.I will say though that this point and click game is not for everyone. The black-and-white aesthetic is hit and miss when it comes to graphic capability, but that's the design choice the game runs with, and doesn't factor in as much as whether or not you find the characters or story intriguing. I won't lie, as someone who voice acts and has voice acted in at least one game on Steam, the voices leave much to be desired, and sometimes you learn details that you shouldn't have learned until later, or you never figure out the story behind a certain character or plot point. The scares are all quite decent- the ones in Harbour Cottage and especially ""The Room"" are particularly effective in that regard, but the game equalizes it with the fact that you're supposed to be looking for these scares, which, for the most part, are simply ghost sightings through your camera. However, capturing all the secrets the town of Saxton has to offer, unearthing all the spirits and trying to uncover all the mysteries has its own charms, especially with the myriad of subplots brought in.PROS:- Decent storyline and gameplay mechanics.- Nice allusions to the Dark Fall franchise, including the main character Nigel Danvers having been a character from the first game.- The scares, when they are effective, are very effective, even when they don't register a ""jump"" or ""shock"" value. Sometimes it's just really good at building dread or nagging suspicion.- The characters all have their own personalities, and while most of them are two-dimensional, they really do stand out on their own, especially in comparison to other point-and-click games.- The gameplay mechanics of using technologies and pseudo-sciences, old and new, to hunt down, record, or figure out how to repel ghosts is a fairly novel one.- Really good game length, it truly can go on for a while.CONS:- The voice acting leaves something to be desired. Especially with Nigel... pausing... during every other word... like this.- The characters' two-dimensionalities can be pretty apparent at times.- The main character sometimes can just be downright unlikable.- If you're into jumpscares, I can name about three that happen in this game. The rest is dread, disturbing imagery, or unnerving implications.- Walking around everywhere, especially since Saxton isn't the biggest place around, sometimes gets a little repetitive, and you have to complete every single task on a given day to progress to the next.All in all, I like it. It's a wonderful horror point-and-click game, and it's got a very nice story behind it, too, with an ending that brings Twin Peaks to mind. All in all, I can't wait for the sequels, but I do know that it's just not for everybody. But if you like point and click and want a little atmospheric horror goodness in there, it's not a bad game to pick up and try out."

The worst of which is centered around the main character Nigel Danvers. Who is voiced, written and modeled after the games creator Jonathan Boakes. This makes the poor voice direction all the more baffling. Under the guise of going for an eerie atmosphere the people ramble nonsense and the ""conversations"" as they were are mostly just two people taking turns saying things with little regard for the presense of the other person. In that it all feels very poorly directed and out of place.The biggest villain in this regard is the main charachter Nigel. His stiff delivery and ability to make you utterly loathe him is uncanny. There are many instances in which it seems the person speaking the line had no idea of the context of said line in the game. It's bad.The game itself is a fairly standard point and click. With weird floaty and painfully slow animations. As well as♥♥♥♥♥♥backwards puzzle logic. There are many instances where you know exactly what you need to do, but they game won't let you do it because you have to click everything in one very certain order at specific times."

The Lost Crown gains bragging rights for being a game that is not big on graphics, but it has sustances.  You play as Nigel Danvers, on the run from Hadden Corporation after witnessing some of their technological hardware, which apparently is illegal by their standards.  Danvers then enters a train that takes him to the Sedgemarsh Station which leads to the shady harbor town of Saxton.  Thankfully, Nigel discovers the town is riddled in mystery of the paranormal and is even helped by Hadden using ghost hunting equipment to discover the towns ancient treasure The Saxton Crown.  So, as the player you control Nigel to explore the town, talk to people and solve puzzles.  What I like is that the game will give you a chime once the puzzle is met.  Also, certain actions and cutscense will play unless you solve certain puzzles, like before Nigel goes to bed, he must place the camera on the window sill before going to sleep in order to continue.  This is good idea and little things like these help with the games creepy atmosphere.  Yes, creepy is a great word to put in this perspective.  I am also glad that there are no jump scares, unlike FNAF, the presence of scary looms over you and watches you from shadows, until it scares you.Using the tools are great as well.  You have many things to work with such as tape recorders to here EVP, a camera to take pictures for both scenery and the paranormal, a E.M.F. Meter to find powerful forces, and a Night Vision Camcorder to see in the dark and record movement.  The harbor town of Saxton is like a small dream come true and I do enjoy the ambience this game has.  It has calm quiet moments that enjoy the scenery, and there are times on where it will scare you.  I recommend to anyone if their are interested into ghost hunting and reading a huge story.  As always if you don't like it, you don't, but if you want to explore the curious side of things, I highly recommend you pick this one up."

A long, immersive, engrossing tale of hauntings and ghostly encounters it should appeal well to fans of MR James and the kind of lo-fi ghostly horror that British TV used to excel at such as the BBC Ghost stories at Christmas, West Country Tales, and the old Hammer House of Horror and the like.It's certainly not without it's flaws for sure; the voice acting is beyond hammy, the animations are wooden (although they are as good as needs be for this kind of game) and to be blunt the main protagonist is rude, sarcastic and generally a bit of a d*ck - he'd certainly get a good punch on the nose if he approached people like that in real life!After awhile however I found this added to the games charm rather from detracting from the experience and the lead character does grow on you as the game progresses.The use of photographed backdrops of a quaint seaside village and the surrounding countryside are also quite stunning and again add to the games unique charm.It's certainly, for the most part about as scary as someone in a white sheet going ""woooo!"" but this isn't about Silent Hill-esque psychological terrors and perverted demons of the mind, rather a quaint, pleasantly hokey and quintessentially English take on ghost hunting (and it it did have a few moments which were actually quite chilling, cat lovers beware!)Oh and the nutter in the antique shop is bloody hilarious!
