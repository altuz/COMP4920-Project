For a game that seemingly no one knew was even being made, it's confusingly well-crafted and substantial!  I mean it.  The graphics are extremely polished.  Animations are high quality and often pretty substantial.  I'm a little curious why it's only estimated at being two hours long.  Perhaps if you know exactly what you're doing in advance.  Personally, I'm at more than three hours and I doubt I'm halfway done yet.For $5, I'd say this is a no-brainer.  The only negative thing I have to say is that the heavy atmosphere that made the first game so memorable is often absent here, but as an intentional plot point.  You're literally at a Halloween party, so the game is a LOT more active and... goofy.  Not at all what I'd say has previously defined the series, which may be a bit off-putting.  Still though, all the old elements are present, and a real ghost story is coming to the front for me now.Just in time for Halloween!  Grab it!"

This is a perfect Halloween story with lots of references to the first game.It is very easy to get stuck and i found some items that seemed to have no point other than just being there. You will have to go back and forth a lot to check if you did the correct thing.On the DJ Voucher scene, the game can bug out. Simply press F5 and hit No, it should bring your mouse pointer back up and you can leave the scene.Enjoy and Happy Halloween! If you liked The Lost Crown, you will enjoy this short tale."

This game was very easy to purchase (and at a great price) and easy to download and install.  The game has a great atmosphere, even the first scene makes you jump!

,Recommended,291770,18799890,"Posted: 31 October, 2015",all,alexanderlucard,"The Last Crown: Midnight Horror is a nice short thematic point and click adventure game that is a direct sequel to ""The Lost Crown"" and a prequel to the upcoming Blackenrock game from Darkling Room Studios. Like most of Mr. Boakes' games, there is a lot of optional activity and superfluous items you don't need. I carried arround that Hot Dog from beginning to end for example.The adventure places you once again int he role of Nigel Danvers as you try to solve what appears to be a haunting at the local pub. The game oozes with atmosphere and style and I love that the came has kept the mostly black and white graphics which made the original game, The Lost Crown, so striking. The music, mood, visuals and atmophere should keep fans of TLC and the Darkfall games happy from beginning to end. You'll also find that events are somewhat more randomized than in most adventure games which tend to be extremely linear. An event with the police didn't occur with me until the very end of the game, while for most people I've talked to, it happened at the very beginning.Now that said, the game is far from perfect. Although it took me 4.1 hours to beat, half of that time was reloading the game due to crashes or stalls. There's a well known bug that occurs when you hand in the DJ Voucher. Thankfully this is not necessary to finish the game so just don't do anything with it if you get it.  I was surprised the game crashed on me four different times. Once after the seance and three other times in different rooms. I could play Batman: Arkham Knight without the slightest hiccup when it first came out yet this adventure game crashed on me several times. So remember to save regularly so you don't have to repeat things like I did!Another thing to remember is that the game has some very small hot spots and, unlike some other modern adventure games, you can't just click the space button to see all the available locations. This does mean you'll be huting and pecking for things that you don't see or just outright don't trigger right away. Some of these include the wall by the rotting fish, the pots int he kitchen, the keyhole on the fourth door in floor two you gain access to towards the end of the game and so on. So be prepared to be thorough and don't be shy in asking for help in the community boards if you get stuck. TLC fans are a great lot and already people have been helping each other out left and right here on the game's Steam board.  There will be times you get frustrated. Then once someone helps you along, the solution will make a lot of sense in retrospect. Just remember to pass the help along.Overall, Midnight Horror is a fun but flawed game. I love the artistic style of the game and the story told here. It's a nice classic ghost story in the vein of some great Victorian writers andf it was the perfect game for the Halloween Holiday season."

This transition piece was a welcome surprise by Jonathan Boakes, and ran about 5hrs of gameplay. The setting was lovely as always in Boakes games', and the atmosphere was suitably haunting (yes, the pun is intended). Plot was also egaging for a shorter game. There were a few thing that were left unresolved, but I'm assuming (hoping) those will be resolved in the next installment. Overall, well done and worth the price."

I personally hadn't had a clue there was such a thing in the works!  But I snapped it up the minute I saw it, and I'm completely delighted by it.As a caveat, you will want to have played The Last Crown (original game) before you play this, or you will lose a good chunk of pretty much everything in the translation.Playtime runs about 3-4 hours depending on how much you lollygag around, or in my case, wander off to answer the phone and forget to shut it off.From a technical standpoint, this game continues on the same atmosphere as the original; graphics, sounds, scenery, and character design are the same.  Nigel's slightly-odd voice mannerisms are also still there (but for some reason, I find his somewhat Shatner-esque pauses endearing rather than irritating).  It appears all previous voice actors reprised their roles.From a plot standpoint, it's not particularly deep like it's predecessor, but it's not supposed to be.  As a Halloween short and interlude between main games, it's perfect.  Short and sweet, but leaving some questions which I suspect will lead into the next main game.Gameplay is also the same as the previous game.  Inventory, navigation, dialogue, etc. are similar if not identical.  The ghost-hunting mechanics are very similar but have been souped up a little to give the player somewhat more control over the situation rather than taking static pictures and whatnot, and I appreciated that a lot.All in all, this is worth it especially if you enjoyed the previous game.  I know that I, at least, am waiting impatiently for the next installment of this series!"

It's quite short and takes a bit of experimentation to get through, but it's fun.I find that with many games like these I get irretrievably stuck on certain parts and have to rely on the Internet to see me through.Not so with this one; it's compact enough so that while you do have to put your mind to it, you don't need to solve a stupidly complex mystery to progress.I've noticed that some have experienced issues with the DJ scene. For what it's worth, I personally did not have any problems with glitches.Overall, a great game and well worth the $5.00 price tag, especially around Halloween."

After years of waiting for a sequel to the fantastic ""The Lost Crown"" I was very happy to return to Saxton, all its familiar inhabitants and its spooky atmosphere.Of course, this being a short (it took me 4 hours to finish) Halloween special centered around a party in The Bear, the atmosphere is less creepy and much more humorous, but that was quite enjoyable. Nigel has grown much more sarcastic since the last installment, and you get to see him drunk! ;-)The graphics and the voice acting have improved considerably since the Lost Crown and the controls are simple and straightforward.The only negative point is that you'll spend a lot of time pondering what to do next, with no clear direction or hints what to do, feeling like you've tried everything already. Some things seemed to hint at interesting puzzles but never went anywhere - I hope they will be resolved in the next full game.I still recommend Midnight Horror wholeheartedly to any fan of The Lost Crown who's been as eager to return to Saxton as I've been. Can't wait for Blackenrock!"

Thankfully for the reputation of the first game this is just a light-hearted jaunt because I'd be annoyed that the fantastic mood and storytelling of the original was now lost. As far as this goes it is rough around the edges with some of the voice acting all over the shop and some minor bugs, however the most disappointing was the linear gameplay: even though I knew the solution to a bunch of puzzles I could not progress unless I'd clicked on a certain object or talked to the right person, which forced me to consult a walkthrough to allow the game to let me move on. Whilst playing this I thought back to the first game and I cannot remember this being so frustrating.

,Recommended,291770,29154946,Posted: 9 January,all,IFoundADeadRat,"This is a short point and click game that follows The Lost Crown.  It is set in the same town with many of the same characters but is a much smaller game.  I finished it in about 8 hours playing very leisurely but an experienced adventure gamer may finish in just a couple of  hours.  There are only a few puzzles and they are not very difficult.  There are lots of things that seem important but don't lead anywhere, and you can sidetracked on them. There are no steam achievements for it.During play it can seem like you're stuck and not making any progress.  You'll perform some action and it isn't immediately clear sometimes that you've done anything.   There are choices that will affect the outcome if not the main story line.  I saw questions in the forums asking whether or not the game was bugged.  I played through without any issues at all and I think it plays as designed.  My advice if you're stuck is to look around thoroughly, talk to everyone multiple times, do actions multiple times (even if they don't seem to do anything), and don't forget outside.  There are only a few areas in this game so there really isn't that much to check.  I would not resort to a walkthough because there are very few things to solve here and you'll probably regret it.  I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes point and click adventure games."

The tones and nuance of the atmosphere throughout the games memorable scenes, the extremely accomplished and artful use of fairly lo-fi graphics, the eccentric yet sincere English regionalism of the setting and cast, intelligently written puzzles and mysteries and a haunting soundtrack lifted that game above so many other ghostly themed titles. Given how many lazily developed first-person jumpscareathons lurch up from under algae-laden bridges on Steam of late, Darkling Rooms commitment to legitimately scripted and evidently well-researched horror is nothing short of heroic in this market of lowest common denominators. I feel like it's been an age since the announcement of (and the delay of)  the titles sequel, but given that it's apparentlyfinallycoming out this year warms my cockles."
