76561198023208567,Not Recommended,291910,10199672,"Posted: 22 May, 2014",all,SHRN Bowmaster,"As a Firefighter I have a tendency to nitpick at games like this.Yes it's firefighter simulator, and yes it's clearly german based, so some of my points of view may not apply since I know next to nothing about germans and firefighting outside of the fact Stuphen makes really nice apparatus and Draugr is kinda of a garbage SCBA compared Scott packs (my opinions)1. Firefighting. This game has some aspects of firefighting right, like water, water is important and keeping your equpiment in usable order is important. But it kinda tanked on everything else. I pulled 4 firefighting calls total on this, You can't crouch at all (Not sure whats with that) you are in turnout gear 24/7. Even when driving an ambulance. This game has no concept of actual fire scenes. It's essentially, you show up, pull out a section of hoseline and it is magically never ending and longer than than space and time itself. Then you just go rambo. No Incident Command, no assigned positions, nothing. Just Put water on Fire.2. Pre-Hospital Care. There is none. And what they tried to dress up and label as EMS in this game is a total joke. You literally drive the ambulance to the scene. Open your doors, pick up the patient (LITERALLY, NO BACKBOARD, NO C-COLLAR, YOU LITERALLY GRAB THEM WITH TWO HANDS AND CARRY THEM TO THE AMBULANCE....) and drive to the hospital. I even did this for a cyclist that got hit by a car...I mean come on..Thats EMS 101....3. AI. The NPCs that drive in the game are ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I got sideswipped, t-boned, pushed off the road....Even with sirens and lights running...I mean seriously. Do people try and hit ambulances and fire engines in germany?I just want a real simulator....Not some gussied up excuse for a game."
,Not Recommended,291910,10190526,"Posted: 21 May, 2014",all,✫ Aionion,"Buggy and extremely unpolished-------------------------------------------This isn't intended to be a AAA title, I understand that. But I do expect a game where at least some measurable effort has been put into it. I expect a sim to actually simulate what it is said to be a sim of. I just didn't find that here, and instead, I found a seemingly incomplete, too early to be released attempt to be a firefighting sim. There are too many things wrong with the game that break the immersion of it feeling like a firefighting simulation.Had this been an early access game, I may have been able to see potential (and obviously, reviewed it differently). But because this is allegedly a complete game, it must be reviewed accordingly.=== THE GOOD ===The premise. To be honest, that's about all I could find good with the game. I do find the genre (rescue simulator) interesting and fun, but the premise only takes us so far...the mechanics, gameplay, ambiance, etc. all must come together to help immerse the player in the experience. The game just doesn't do that.=== THE BAD ===AMBIENT SOUND ISSUES--engine sound cuts on and off despite there being no running vehicles nearby--door sound opening/closing whenever a person is nearby in the station (despite no doors opening/closing nearby)--no sound distance; all same level despite distance (with a couple exceptions of cars I found while I was walking on road, but even then, they cut in and out instead of properly fading in and out)--repeat voice loops (constant ""good morning"" and ""Man, another shift that seems like it will never end."" On the way back from the event, he kept repeating ""I could really do with another hour of sleep.""  I didn't know firefighters complained so much about their job.--roaring fire sound same for all fires, even an extremely small 1 box fire. That is, it doesn't matter if a building is on fire or if it is a shoebox, it's a roaring fire with the same sound effect 100% of the timeGRAPHIC ISSUES--shading is bad on characters and other assets, more like smoke. It's difficult to describe, I've never seen a game do that before. I've changed the settings to see if it changes anything, it doesn't. I may post a screenshot to give an example.--reflections don't make sense. You can see reflections of things (like people for example) at angles, distances, and heights that are physically impossible (walking through the tutorial will give you an example of what I meant, but perhaps I should upload a screenshot to illustrate)--hose is non-existent once it is connected to water source. Nozzle appears in hand, but it is never connected to the hose. This is an immersion breaker.--reflections in vehicle rear view mirror are non-existent (except for sometimes, the top 1/4 of the rear view mirror displays the sky, nothing more)--100% of all civilian vehicles have darkest possible tint - can't see inside any vehicleBAD AI--walks randomly w/o meaning (back and forth down halls). They have no real tasks, they do nothing. They are just there to give the illusion that the facility is not empty, but it just doesn't work IMO.--will continue to walk into obstacles (like a desk). Eventually they seem to stop...but it takes a little while before they figure out they can't walk through the desk, it's weird.--colleagues do not actually do anything at all. They are there just for aesthetics (they do not put fires, they only appear to be doing so). The Steam home page advertises that your fellow firefighters do help you...but they don't. They don't do jack. The outcome of an event/emergency rests entirely with you...the other ""people"" there are just for show.=== THE UGLY ===GAMEPLAY--Tutorial only takes you through walkthrough of the department, it does not teach you the operations of the vehicles, nor does it tell you anything about any of the tools you use in putting out fires. There's a fair amount of different equipment, but absolutely no training on how to use them or what it connects to, etc.The tutorial does absolutely nothing more than what an in-game map could do. That is no exaggeration. There is no benefit that the tut gives other than showing you where rooms are and in some rooms, what can be found there (a couple items here, coffee maker here, etc.).--Mouse sensitivity - despite having it on its lowest settings, it's still extremely sensitive, I had to use my control panel to adjust settings since game's settings are insufficient. 1st time I've ever had to do that in a game.--Physics...high pressure hose does not affect any entity in game except fire. 100% of all entities are there for aesthetics only (gas cans, boxes, trash, etc.). There are no movable objects.--Water...once it leaves the hose, it magically appears, never to be seen again. There is no water on the ground, no soaking walls, nothing. It leaves the hose and disppears into thin air.--cars take ZERO damage when running into them. They stop (at least), but nothing else happens. Obviously this is not a demolition sim....but I expected at some some sign of damage or some penalty. There's not a scratch on any vehicle, not even the truck I'm driving.--100% clipping when walking into cars (or them driving into you). They are ""ghost cars"" apparently.=== CONCLUSION ===This is a game I'd expect to be in very early access. Currently, there are many early access games that are further along than this.   The idea behind the game (being a firefighter faced with different emergencies) is great, but the application fails miserably IMO.  Far too many bugs, immersion breaking issues, and lack of polish in just about every area imaginable.I had reasonable hopes for the game, but they were dashed by a poorly delivered product on almost every level possible.IMO, the game is worth around $5. I doubt that many players will get more than a few hours of game play from it as it is tedious, buggy, doesn't make sense at times, annoying (eg sounds), and has too many immersion breaking issues."

,Recommended,291910,13920901,"Posted: 10 January, 2015",all,Tzuyu,"This game has a few bugs/glitches I really want for them to fix. Firstly mainly at car accidents, when they say oil has spilled sometimes there is no spilled oil which just makes me have to reset the whole game. It's really annoying.Secondly as there are fires such as when a car has caught on fire near and it's near rocks, garbage and benches, they are normally impossible to put out. I'm always dispointed as those type of operations sometime happen as my shift is nearly done and I'm happy and all that and then they are impossible, which you then have to reset or just ragequit.Thirdly as I am rushing to a scene the car is really easy to slip which can lead to a flip over which then ends the whole operation.Now the last one is that sometimes the lights and siren aren't always appearing and working as usual. And mainly alot of features and things are mainly like copied. Inside the trucks it is un-releastic. I know that all these excailbur publishing games use the same technique. And I know that these are games base in Germany.Please try to find a solution.On the other hand, the game is really enjoyable and good with all these different operations. I really enjoy the different types of vehicles you get to use at each operation depending on your rank/skill level. This is probaly the best firefighting game they have made yet."

I played the game and i see why some people like it and some don't. This game is really buggy and really needs some work done to it.  Someone in another post had already posted all the problem so no need to post anything.AI in the game is the really bad.AI people:What is up with this who walks thur cars and walk around when there is a fire. I mean come on when there a real fire people arent going to walk around next to a fire building they stay clear.AI vehicles :Are you kidden meThe vehicle do pull over but don't stop. I was going to a fire had the siren and blue lights on and a car decided to pull right out in front of me.Callouts:I know this is a simulation game but come on. I get more callouts than the other NPC do and they only go out when there is something big that needs to be changed.Controler:Devleoper can add a controller support for this instead of the keyboard all the time.just to make this short this game needs alot more work done to it.

The concept of this game is great, and it could easily be a great game. However, it is not carried out very well. The graphics are iffy at best, but the real problem is the framerate. No matter what your specs are, this game will have an average FPS far lower than 30 due to it using an outdated unity engine. Also, this game has too many glitches to count. For example, on one of the missions for the swap-body vehicle, the ambulance and the batallion car keep phasing inside each other and then you run out of time and lose the mission."

It is a very basic firefighting simulator. I wish it went more in depth like for instance, having to triage a patient and treat them on scene before loading them ino the ambulance and actualy place them on a stretcher instead of literally picking up the patient and driving them to the hospital or the MVA's where you litterally go and cut the AB&C poston the drivers side, pick the patient up, take him/her to the paramedic, and take out the battery.That just seems really basic and takes away all the realism and it gets really boring after doing it two or three times. The timer is another issue for me that I dont quite undersand. I get having a timer getting to the scene, but having one while on scene is very inconvenient because I kow I like to take my time and come up with a strategy but when you dont beat the timer you have to start the entire shift over again. It would aso be nice to switch between a fog pattern and a straitstream when fighting fires as well as display the hose lines fully and more mission diversity. I got three oil spill missions back to back and one MVA one shift and it just got boring.

Simply put you drive to a scene (often offroad since ai traffic has no concept of your presence) pull out a hose and put water on an area until the fire is out some times 30 seconds a mission sometimes a full minute. Then you get back in your truck drive back to the station and wait 5 more minutes and rinse repeat. The missions are not very extravagant mostly garbage fires from what I saw. I like much more dynamic gaming than what was offered, vehicle maintenance is a joke, EMS is a joke, AI is a joke, and fire fighting in general was disapointing to say it generously. Its hard to judge some of these games so harshly but in all honesty they are mass produced, just check any major simulation website you'll see one for each year, all of them buggy and half-a%% done...this one just happened to make it on steam."

The gameplay is fun and most of the missions are good too. What sucks about it is that multiple times on multiple missions there are fires you cant put out. I have gone on youtube and to fourums and asked what you can do and the answer is nothing. The most commen response is to lower your graphics and resolution but even after you do that it still doesnt work. What is also bad about this game is that you unlock freeplay after you finish the campain which is bad because you cant beet the campain. I'm on the last mission and of course there are fires you cant put out and the only way to beat the mission is to save the people which you can't do because you will be burned and to put all of the fires which you cant do. I feel as if the company that made this game just didn't try with their horrible codeing. If your going to be lazy with your codeing atleast make freeplay unlocked so you can play what actually works. If they were to update their codeing so that ALL fires could be put out I would buy this game and write a good reveiw in a hartbeet.

I mean doing 120 KMH around corners? one steady engine noise so no sound of acceleration, the water looks like a white smoke.. my god I could keep listing, if you happen to read these forums before buying.. save the money and spend it on a carton fire game, you will get better details and a less bugged game for the money.It's a disgrace that Steam have this for sale.
