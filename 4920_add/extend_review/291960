It is not without some flaws, though.First, the great things:+ It's Wizardry. Grid-based maps, 6 party members, 9 different races, 16 different classes (You can recruit monsters too!). You can change classes, too, with some restrictions.+ 75+ floors across 16 different dungeons to explore, all with a unique environment and music. Lots of variety. Yes, rotating floors, teleporters, pitch black rooms, shoots, pits, traps, ie what you would expect in a Wizardry game.+ 400+ GORGEOUS hand-crafted monster models. Detailed in-game bestiary as you find more monsters+ 500+ different items/weapons/armor+ 65 quests, fairly non-linear+ Weapon/armor crafting. Endless customization to fit your needs.+ Great music, especially the 8 battle themes. Soundtrack included!+ Random encounters are rare. 90% of battles are from preset monster locations that respawn if you leave the dungeonNow the bad things:- Pretty bad menus. You get used to them after awhile though and quickly learn how to navigate them efficiently- Limited inventory space (Warehouse eventually gets expanded to 99 which is fantastic!)- Maps are consumable, but early in the game you get a reusable map item, and there are magic spells that let you view the ENTIRE dungeon on all floors.- Leveling up system is confusing for new players. HP gains are based on your vitality and level so don't worry about how much HP you are gaining per level, because it will balance out. If you want to min/max your stats, you have the freedom to.If you are looking for a huge game that rewards you with exploration and experimentation, Elminage Gothic fits the bill. Having finally done everything possible in the game, I must say that it was some of the best 300+ hours I've spent.9/10 as there are some things that could be improved. Can't complain though because games like this are pretty rare."

Why I'm I telling you this is because its my first impressions of Elminage Gothic (EG) I'm not a big RPG gamer with the exception of FF titiles and Dragon Quest. If you're thinking of buying this due to the 1st person RPG style from a yesteryear I can't think this will disappoint many. I rather have been enjoying EG however a few niggles which seem to stand out! It doesn't explain very much. This can be a + or - depending on preference. The biggest wall you will hit is getting lost and a party wipeout due to how the game has consumable maps!? Thats right single use maps, run out and its hit and miss if you'll see light again. Once this is understood and you buy lots of magic maps and remember to manage items and know when to head back its not bad. Although I could see this putting more casual gamers off. Overall this has the ability to become a favourite of mine."
76561198002811614,Recommended,291960,12686776,"Posted: 29 October, 2014",all,DeviateScaleCodpiece,"While playing Etrian Odyssey has spoiled me quite a bit, comparing the two is like comparing apples to oranges. While I would reccomend the former to anyone, Elminage has a few issues that give me a little hesitation.  Some of the sound choices put me off. The music isn't that bad, fortunately, yet the menu confirmation sound is a bit over-loud.  The art direction is very very top notch and the ability to go into an art gallery mode to appreciate the beasties you fight is a welcome decision.What is NOT a welcome decision was that this port removed the capability to insert artwork from outside sources for your own characters! Some of us like to draw our own characters and thrust them into the character grinder that is the Wizardry series.  This was a missed feature and Starfish really dropped the ball on this.Gripes aside, the real meat and bones is the wizardry gameplay and from the get-go the game does not pull its punches. If you decide to generate your own characters ( And you should! ) the starter dungeon goes from a challenge for the pregenerated level 5s to a nightmare for your level ones.  Every level you get, even if it's one HP point,  you will savor and each victory comes that much sweeter, especially since party members can now cover each other!  Having a tank character is actually a huge asset and lets your dual-wielders or two-handers take a breather if they get picked on, since he or she can defend them.  It's a nice little touch of teamwork from the usual fight/fight/fight/parry/parry/parry.Speaking of, the dreaded fight/fight/fight/parry/parry/parry is something that no longer happens nearly as often.  Furthermore, you can also screw monsters over by putting thieves in the front line.  If monsters can't detect them, they can't target them, nor can they aim at the back line, unless they have a longer range weapon.Oh that's right, kids. Long range weapons are no longer just for your characters. From the second dungeon on, your back row can be exposed to heat from spear wielders and ninja weapons that can behead on a lucky shot. Still, back line members are nowhere near as likely to get pinged off as your front line is, so there is that going for them. Oh, and on the subject of being hidden? Enemies can hide too and screw over your chances at getting at the mages in the back line. If you happen to encounter a group of mages with fighters in the back row, the fighters will gladly advance on you to keep their casters out of the line of fire.There are also classes that are nonstandard from the classic wizardry series, and in a decision that made me smile, there are also genders that are nonstandard from normal nomenclature. I got a chuckle when I rolled an effeminate ""?"" gender mage, only to find out later that they also qualify for a valkyrie class change when they get the stats for it, their indeterminate gender qualifying them for the normally female-only class.There really is a lot to like here, and the ups far outweigh the downs. I just wish that they would have included the ability for us to import our own drawings so we could play as characters we truly make. Alas, it is a fly in the ointment, but if you've ever played, and liked the Wizardry series, this is Wizardry, 110% so.  Fans of the RPG Genre should find enough here to greatly enjoy and I would gladly reccomend it to them, especially at the $10 price tag.  It's a crime not to enjoy another entry in the wizardry series."

,Recommended,291960,12142452,"Posted: 18 September, 2014",all,Lymanity,"The purpose of this review is to let people know whether or not this port is acceptable.This is a publication by Ghostlight, which has its sister company, Laughing Jackal, handle ports to PC. I have played another Ghostlight pub before, Agarest, and I felt that the port was acceptable, but not great.In the case of Elminage, I do see a great improvement. The cutscenes are still a little choppy, though I think this may be a problem with .wmv running inside the game engine. Other than that, the gameplay is flawlessly implemented to PC. You can play with controller or keyboard and mouse and they both work equally well, though I could do with an option for mouse sensitivity because I play on such a small surface.I will cover briefly some other topics about the game:A lot of elements of gameplay were not covered in the manual, though by now it has been diseminated onto the internet being that this is a port of a game that is a few years old. While this is a JRPG it has deeper roots than Dragon Warrior/Quest, most notably Wizardry. If you are not familiar with Wizardry and you are wondering if you would like this game, I encourage you to do some research. This game is THAC0 based and a lot of people dislike that system, but having been acquainted with this system long ago I do like it.The artwork is pretty good. It reminds me of Atlus games pre-Persona 3, but with better resolution.Finally, the music works well with the atmosphere the game is trying to convey and is properly implemented. Previously, Agarest had some issues with improper looping of music, but I detect none of those issues here.This game is complex, so I do encourage you to do your research before purchasing, but if this game turns out to be up your alley then it's money well spent."

Ability to change class to acess some harder to achive classes such Samurai, Lord, Ninja or Valkyrie.But also it dos have very interessing ideas, for having multiple parties, some new classes like Shaman (in fact the wiki says its a Kannagi and does look like more shinto priest), Servant (more like Maid/Butler), Summoner.The music is good fell very like a higher quality (or more modern) thing you would hear while playing a older rpg, however might fell a bit repetitive, but its amazing game to play while listening to podcast. The artwork is good, fell like the exact mix between old school art in western rpgs and what you would expect in jrpgs.If you like old Wizardry games and JRPGs, this game is must."

Be warned, it is based more on Wizardry 1-3 than anything else. Dungeons are 20 by 20, and the game will take every possible advantage against you.You can turn the tables though.It lacks some modern features, the interface is clunky, and the sound effects are VERY annoying, but it is still a fantastic experience if you can handle interface issues. I hope this indicates that more games of the type are coming to steam, because I really can't get enough grid based, turn based dungeon crawlers."

Have invested about 100 hours in game play to date and have enjoyed every minute.100% chance I'll finish the game.    100% chance I'll play it again with different character classes.Every battle comes with anxiety and that is what makes it great.So many people complain about the maps.  Non issue.  A couple of dungeons in you get the Goblin map which has unlimited uses but can break.    I found myself traveling back to town often enough anyway that it was complete non-issue.Complaints about  early access reward not showing up in time .  Who cares.  Do you buy a game for early access reward or do you buy it for gaming experience?There are complaints about needing to grind in the early stages.  Not actually true.  You'll die more often and it's a touch harder to play dungeons after the 1st one without having done at least some grinding but is that really a negative?   Knowing you have to approach every battle like it's the last battle your party will ever have.  Is that truly a negative ?  I found it positive.   And if you find it a nuissance, you can choose to do the grinding.  At one juncture I did a couple of levels, is an hour or two.The game becomes more ""approachable"" once you get the Mage Diomente spell.  Allows you to teleport wherever you want.   Without it, it can get tediuos.  But given it's accessible for a Mage quite early, I don't see this as a negative either.Just plan your party reasonably and you'll be fine.My party which has died a very limited number of times:Innocent Characters:  Brawler, Samurai, Valkyrie, Mage.Between them I have 18 Diomente spells allowing me to complete dungeons without complaining about maps.  I quite literally bounce all over the maps as I like to do every square.The other two characters:Alchemist and Lord.    The Lord started as a Cleric.   Is a pretty lame character at this juncture.  Wish I had done something different - Cleric to Summoner comes to mind.   The Alchemist started as a Thief.   I don't miss the Thieving abilities.  I can open chests and my char investory is usually full before I use up all the High Portal spells.  I like the Alchemist Forging skill.I didn't bother with a Bishop for Identify and the dual spell casting - too much EXP needed to level up and money is plentiful.Overall - great game.

But it's just not good.The first big problem is that this is an intensely, intensely mechanics-driven game that is awful at explaining those mechanics. The entire game is translated from Japanese, and done so poorly. The in-game explanations for mechanics are usually vague or misleading, in a tiny scrolling 1-line box. The manual explains some things, but not nearly enough. At the same time, the game itself is wildly unbalanced. This is normally fine for this type of game, discovering abusive combinations and tricks is half the fun, but you basically can only figure things out through trial and error or going online for guides. A 'blind' playthrough, even for someone with huge amounts of RPG experience, would be practically unplayable. You can't just 'go with sounds good' because the game is intensely punishing for mistakes.That translation, combined with the natural vagueness of a wizardry clone, also makes questing an enormous pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ The interactions with the story and NPC's are incredibly vague: characters stand alone in dungeons and bark a short paragraph of vague, badly translated info at you, and then you're supposed to put 2 and 2 together and figure out what they need. If you forget what they said, you're kind of screwed. Again, this sort of stuff would be tolerable if the game was well made, well translated, with a good UI, but it's just not.Finally, this just isn't a well designed game. The dungeons are tedious, samey loops designed to be as drawn out as possible. The map system is really ill-considered, I'm actually fine with limiting map access, but this is like a weird worst of both worlds that just winds up being annoying. Character building is FILLED with lots of obscure mechanics that are impossible to know ahead of time without a guide and that can have a big impact. The game is incredibly random, literally in the sense of using random numbers, and forces the player to cope with that without giving them the knowledge to actually plan ahead and do so. The game relies immensely on grinding and repitition, but then has an absolutely awful UI to make that experience as lame as possible.It's just not a good game. I got this for $3 on a sale. For that price, it's fun and worth it if you like the genre. For the 10 dollar list price though, even at that cheap price, it's just not worth it. The only way you will like this game is if you really love intensely mechanics driven RPG's, know how to play Wizardries, and are willing to put up with a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Even then, it's just not a good example of the genre."

Elminage takes the oldschool grid dungeon crawl experience and adds a lot to it. There's a lot of variety in the dungeons and puzzles offered, the monster art, while sometimes peculiar, is gorgeous and really interesting to look at. I love the variety in classes and races you can play. Admittedly things were a little tedious before I got access to the mage's teleportation spell, but after that things went great.If you like what the oldschool sort of Wizardry games had to offer, this may very well be up your alley."

Elminage Gothic of course keeps up with this tradition. EXCEPT THAT THEY DECIDED TO REMOVE ALL OF IT FOR NO REASON IN THE PC VERSION. Do note that since the original version of the game was made with the ability to add your own stuff in mind, it comes with very few options by default. Well, you're stuck with those limited default options. Enjoy.The PC port is badly-done too (this was originally a PSP game), with everything looking hilarious oversized, and the localisation work is shoddy with a lot of falling back to NES era ""we can't fit all the text in so let's just make it all acronyms"". It's also odd how the nickname field doesn't have as many characters as the name fields which means you might want to have a character's nickname the same thing as their real name and straight up not be able to.I only got this because it was on sale at 294 yen, just a little over a tenth of what the lunatics are asking for on PSN (2571 yen), but the the near to 90% discount just simply doesn't outweigh the problems with this version.Very, VERY disappointing.That being said, you can run it in a small window if you like that sort of thing (watch videos on Youtube while dungeon crawling? Why not?) and the requirements are low enough that it runs fine on laptops so if you're looking for something to play on a flight or something this may be worth considering.The game itself is an alright Wizardry clone, except that Elminage 3 was better in literally every conceivable way (possibly because the series director who handled pretty much everything was fired halfway through 3's development process). Also the whole aging thing is weird."

It /is/ a hard game. And I would be lying if I said that some of the negative reviews didn't have valid reasoning here and there. And, like Elminage Original, the translation job really isn't doing us westerners any favors. But when it comes down to it, party-based dungeon-crawlers are my favorite genre of video games. On top of that, I really like the art in this game. So in summation if you like Wizardry, Class of Heroes, or other games in the genre, this should be a no-brainer.

You have to find how & when to save, too many sub-menus (its possible to create better UI that require less surfing with more efficiency. No drag & drop system when managing items..- Random bonus system at character creation never allow easily to choose your class (Ninja, Lord, are very difficult to create at start because class require too much bonus points to create).- HP/SP recovery sucking system : even if you can camp, i never found resting option button to recover all HP/SP  from team. That mean long travel to dungeons->cities to rest in inn.- Too few portraits by class- Some Ex Skills are exclusive : Sacrifice exist only for cleric pre-generated character level 4, you can't create more characters with such exclusive skills.- Steam version seem to be port from PSP version, controversial version because Elminage Gothic is sequel from previous one Elminage that was better for fan to play in many ways (more classes, more advantages for some classes, more options to play...).- Classes problem : less classes to play than previous Elminage, some like Lord are weakness in protection now. Changing classes must be done as soon as stats match because only some spells can be passed to next class, all others will vanish (Ex Skills, stats above class requirement, class skills)- Level up system : you can't level up outside inn. I guess you need to rest to level up Grrrr.Elminage isn't bad game but if you already played previous version you'll be disapointed because new rules/options not better. In all case you need to balance your team to kill hard (i think its better to kill hard & fast (aoe) than to be better in protections only).You can buy Elminage Gothic but i don't recommend until game will allow me to rest anytime in dungeons. Elminage Gothic concept ruins my experience to play for these reason. When you start level 1 team you NEED to rest.By luck, with community modding, Elminage Gothic can become great game or for those who master how to modify rules."

There's a deeper plot than meets the eye and dark undertones, which I wouldn't spoil for you. The technique to last in the game is to have a balanced team with two mage spell casters as the last tier has the option of teleporting to a specific part of the map, and two cleric spell casters to be able to revive characters. It takes time to know the ins and outs of the classes, but once you do the game would be enjoyable as there's an option of having multiple parties on the same (or different) dungeon. There's wonderful battle sprites and the thrill that keeps you on your toes as you wouldn't know when you'll be killed - thankfully there's multiple save files and loading anywhere within the dungeon, so to revive characters you can save and reload until you luck out at reviving the character.Overall, this game is one of the few on Steam that lasted me hours of gameplay and I'll recommend it to everyone.ProsPuzzles: Time-consuming puzzles and intricate dungeons, each having their own theme. Lots of wall-checking, unless if your hunter can pick up hidden walls.High level-cap: I'm currently on level 400 at the Ibag Tower, and I still get pawned by enemies if I let my guard down.Variety of classes, alignment, skills and class-changing: If you class-change to an unrelated class, you retain 3 of each spell that you reached.

At my current hour count (10) I've barely scratched the surface and only haven't continued lately because life has kept me busy:Highlights:Hardcore dungeon crawling with 92 or so different dungeon levels. These are not the superficial, ""skin"" like differences you see in pretenders, but are things like levels that are partially underwater and your party will drown if you don't move quickly, or levels full of wind tunnels that impede navigation.Difficult, tactics oriented combat in which you cannot solve every combat the same way. While the game starts off simple, it slowly escalates the level of threat it throws at you until you need counter several different game changing abilities so that you stand a chance at all.Complex character building system in which creative multiclassing will get you far, while at the same time un class changed characters (innocents) get powerful equipment only they can use.A large base of loot, of which many items have a unique niche instead of being exactly like x, but better or worse.A complex crafting system in which the bonuses provided by your items can be enhanced or customized.One of the classes (Summoner) can bind and contract monsters and then use them as seventh party members. This system alone has far more depth than many entire games.There are people with hundreds of hours on this game still learning new things about it. I only regret that I haven't had the uninterrupted time for a proper runthrough myself.With all that having been said, if you are a casual gamer or a hardcore pretender you should absolutely stay away. This is not one of those fake hardcore games where you just grind through trivial content, Elminage will not validate you. If you're looking for a grand story... you'll find a alright one, but not for free. This is not one of those visual novel, on rail experiences falsely described as an ""RPG"". This is classic, old school dungeon crawling fun. About the only legitimate problem I'd say is the interface, it's really poorly designed and could definitely do with better placement of options and keybindings but I recommend it in spite of that relatively minor problem."

With random stat gain and loss on lv. this game is more gear based to determine difficulty instead of being reliant on natural power from levels. With many classes to try and roll for upon creation of a party memeber and the ability to change classes you can be very flexible. Be warned however this game absolutely does not hold your hand and with a brand new lv 1 party the creatures on even the first dungeon can pound you into dust and it doesn't get easier. There is also perma death, revival can fail and a memeber can be lost forever oh and insta death is a thing later on also memebers can grow old and die. The difficulty of it might seem a turn off but managing your six party memebers well and planning ahead can make a massive difference. Can you overcome the challenge? This is very worth checking out"

I bought in on the impulse and so far I'm not disappointed.It is a solid dungeon crawler in the olden style, entertaining and supplying a lot of strategic possibilities. There are many classes, with synergies between them, and a system that allows multi-classing, similar to that in Wizardry titles. The difficulty is nice, making every success a real accomplishment of skill and perseverence. Plus there are some little (or not so little...) things like alchemy, which allows for gear modification, summoning system, or item mixing. The ability to freely switch between companions in the city is also a great boon.All in all, I find this game simply fun to play."

If you are a fan of challenging, punishing, brutal games like Dark Souls, and enjoy dungeon-crawling through beautiful dungeons with lots of interesting encounters, gorgeous artwork and enemies to encounter, and much, much more, then you simply have to check this game out.You create a party of 6 adventurers from a variety of classes, races and stats, and head out into the world to explore why monsters have returned from a nearby cave. Well, things start to spiral down from there, and you're dragged into an epic adventure, however, the main draw here is the immersive, first-person dungeon-crawling. The dungeon tiles themselves are decent, but repetitive in their visual appearance. However, the monsters are anything but that. The monster and enemy artwork in this game is ridiculously cool, twisted and surreal. You'll face some really outrageous, creepy and even cringe-inducing enemies, all in high definition on your screen. If there were more variation in the dungeon tiles themselves it would just add to the game, but the monster artwork is more than sufficient.The character development is cool. There are hundreds of unique items to equip and wear, from maces to helmets, as well as other unique loot to find. There are a bunch of classes each with strong advantages and disadvantages that allow you to craft a party of your choosing and discover synergies yourself. You can class switch later on when you meet the stat requirements, and that also has some interesting quirks to it, as you can mix a few traits from different classes that you've already learned. In short, it will keep you playing and developing your party for many hours of old-school CRPG goodness.You will be crawling through all sorts of crazy locations, from maze-like labyrinths, to dungeons with hidden traps around every corner. To find some of the secret locations in the game, you really have to search, and the game does NOT hold your hand for one minute. The game is indeed brutal. The game is modeled after the original Wizardry trilogy, and they do not pull any punches. You'll die, you'll drag your half-dead party back to town only to have the priest turn your characters to ash. Of course, you can re-load your save to fix that, and unfortunately Elminage Gothic does not include a Hardcore or Mania mode that would make saving more of a risk/reward endeavor. Still, the game is tough.If you love challenging games and want to endure the gauntlet in this party-based RPG, just buy the game now. For $9.99 it's an absolute steal since it features over 80+ hours of dungeon-crawling gameplay, with some saying they have played for hundreds of hours due to post-game dungeon content where you will really be tested. And it never gets old because you are never quite sure what's around the next corner, and when you will get brutally murdered next!Try this game now if you're into first-person, dungeon-crawling, old-school RPGs. You will not regret it.10/10!"

I found Elminage Gothic while searching for something similar to W5 and instantly fell in love. Right off the bat you see things that are familar like the ""hub town"", how you create a character, rerolling the character for better stats, and even a room right at the beginning that reminded me of where you find the orb of llylgamyn.Not only is the game familiar, it is modernized.

If you are into RPGs, you will have a blast with this game.If you'r not familiar with Wizardry, I'll explain.  Wizardy was one of the first RPGs to revolutionize the videogame industry.  Many of the RPGs that were produced for the NES, were inspired by the Wizardy games.  The game starts by forming a party of 6 characters.  You can browse a few places in town such as the Inn and Shop; but most of the game takes place inside an underground maze.  The maze gets harder as you descend, forcing you to make frequent trips to the surface to heal and level up.  The character creation is very in-depth and mimics D&D rules some-what.

And don't.Here are just a few since I don't have all day to sit here and write about everything this one did wrong.To start with the game has a poor interface with huge, scrolling descriptive text where smaller text would have fit on the screen and still been large enough to read.  Easily.Buying, selling, moving and equipping is tedious.  Searching chests and disarming is also tedious.  Combat... you guessed it, feels tedious.  Really, any game that has a ""repeat last set of orders"" button for all SIX of your characters (so push one button and repeat all six actoins) is doing something wrong.  I shouldn't want to do the same thing every single turn.  All of my (fairly few) fights have been pretty much like this: 3 melee attack, 3 support defend.  That only changes if someone gets hurt, then I heal with one of the support characters or occasionally have an attack spell tossed out there.  Otherwise support just sits there doing sweet fudge all because I don't have ranged weapons for them.  Yup, classic front row/back row crap.  That's all well and good if you can pick up rocks to throw, or buy a sling right away so characters aren't just sitting there cowering, but from what I've seen you can't.It also has my least favourite thing in any game - that Wolfenstein 3d style vomit-inducing movement (literally makes me nauseous within 5 minutes) and overall the game has mediocre graphics.  And I didn't expect much.So, one semi-good point -  I think the game's mechanics could be good but I can't devote enough time in 2 minute sessions, since anything longer makes me start to feel ill, to get into it enough to find out.So, while I like the concept I don't like the game.
