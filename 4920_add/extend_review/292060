It is an interactive Adobe Air application with art, interviews, behind the scenes making of type stuff. It is not the game. It was never advertised as the game. Even if you are illiterate, which chances are pretty high that you are, it is completely blatant from the pictures on the store page that this is not the game.Titanfall is not on Steam. It will never, ever, ever be released on Steam, nor will Titanfall 2. EA does not release their games on Steam since launching their Origin platform and they never will again.If you are on Windows 10, beware that the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Adobe wrapper they put this program in is broken and does not work on 10. It will say it's installing, but does nothing. You need to extract the application file using 7Zip or WinRAR or WinZip or whatever you prefer, at which point you will get a folder with a setup.exe and the application itself as well as the data folders needed to run the program. Beware it WILL NOT work without the latest version of Adobe Air and it will force you to install it.Content wise, good stuff."

After unckecking ""Add desktop icon"" and ""start after install is finished"", it installed successfully after the second attempt.From there I went back to my library to run the program, a prompt from Adobe Air showed up, asking if I wanted to uninstall or run, so I chose to run the program.From there going through the application is easy and simple - use the arrow keys or mouse to navigate, and close the window like you would any other window.Obviously the people that would be interested in this would be those that would like to know more behind the history of Respawn and Titanfall, as well as getting a glimpse of some of what goes into making these kind of games. If you're into that stuff, I'd recommend it.HOWEVER, if you're running a Windows 8 computer, I'd recommend using Microsoft's Bing Rewards program to get a $3 gift card for the Windows Store, and purchase it through there without having to worry about having to wait through the install process of Adobe Air."

,Recommended,292060,9889845,"Posted: 21 April, 2014",all,mark | dj.,"An interesting read about how Titanfall came to be (or almost didn't come to be, really). If you read the Portal and/or Tomb Raider books as well, you know exactly what to expect here. There's some interactivity in it, but mostly it's just about the history of the game. But why the book is on Steam and the game is not I will never understand (ok, I do, but it's still weird).Reading it completely will take you about 1,5-2 hours so don't expect a real book here, but it's interesting enough to read if you have nothing to do for a couple of hours.[Rating: 79/100]"

The story not only focuses on the developers but on the reporter himself. Seen as biased by his peers after the Dorito scandal of 1996, Geoff Keighley fights to overcome his alcoholism and shed some light on the new indie darlings at Respawn Entertainment.ABOUT:A sexual harassment scandal soon hits Respawn Entertainment/EA, and it's up to Geoff to put his journalism magic powers to the test to figure out what REALLY happened. Sex, drugs, murder, concept art...The world of video game development is a dangerous and erotic place.CONCLUSION:For only $2 you can't say no to this masterpiece. Heck, you've probably spent more on joke gifts to give your friends during steam sales. Treat yourself. This will definitely put a smile on your face."

Yes, it's for a game that's Origin-only. Yes, it's done by Doritos Pope. Doritos Pope is surprisingly informative in the Final Hours and while an ad in the sense that it tells you that Titanfall is a thing, in the sense of being a fully supportive ""rag"" as some knee jerkers on the Steam forums have put it, the Final Hours doesn't really do that. It sticks to the facts of the development, both the good times and the bad times.Especially the bad times.And for a $2 purchase? I say get it, it's fully worth the read."

This one however, is particularly interesting since it tells the tale of the legal battles between Activision and Infinity Ward, how they came to form Respawn, and how the prolonged legal entanglements affected the early stages of development. It's a really fascinating look at the intra-office strife they struggled through as well as some interesting pre-alpha/test footage of the game in various stages of development.If you like Titanfall (which I have really really enjoyed) or are just interested in the history behind Infinity Ward/Respawn, I'd highly recommend it."
