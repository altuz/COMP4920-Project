The game is dated, and a little tricky to get use to but still plays great.  It does have a 4:3 resolution, so on a widescreen monitor it stretches in fullscreen, but you can play windowed to fix this.The 3 UFO games, all thankfully on Steam are all great, if your into Xcom or the older X-com games, you will likely enjoy this game."
,Recommended,292160,14175616,"Posted: 26 January, 2015",all,Nilum,"It's a fun, older title in the Steam catalogue akin to the X-COM series of games. You fight to recover an Earth that has been largely depopulated by a malicious alien menace in a pausable, real-time strategy game.PROS+It's challenging, but not impossible. (Hint: Let them come to you sometimes! Choke points are an essential tactic later in the game!)+There are several different damage types which are stronger and weaker against various enemies, forcing the player to strategize and take squads that have a variety of damage types.+Most weapons remain relevant throughout the game--there's only a few instances where one weapon was genuinely superior to another.+Game has multiple endings. Three, to be exact. I can't spoil them obviously, that's not the point of a review.+Real-time pausable element provides an interesting twist to the usual turn-based X-COM formula.+Geoscape is aesthetically appealing and directly reflects how well you're performing in the war against the enemy.+It has a plot. With twists....CONS-Level designs are fairly basic and sometimes infuriating.-Enemies can sometimes be spawnedbeside your menbefore you even get a chance to do anything.-The last couple levels show signs the game was rushed out the door.-The voice acting is so atrocious it's hilarious. Go to the options menu and turn off voices.-It has a plot. With sometimesstupidtwists.If you really need a numeric score: 7/10. Playable, fun, appealing to people who enjoy X-COM and Real-Time Strategy games.PS:If you have a widescreen monitor or are encountering technical issues, you may want to run it in a window with a couple other settings. To do this, right click on the UFO: Aftermath in Steam and select ""Properties"", then select ""Launch Options"". From there, add this: --options multisample=4 anisotropy=8 loadall=FALSE video_caption=TRUE --option fullscreen=FALSEHave fun taking back the Earth!"
,Recommended,292160,9944750,"Posted: 26 April, 2014",all,Teiwaz,"It's about time this game came to Steam!This game is a worthy successfor to the original x-com, and is one of the high-water marks for the genre. It takes all of the core ideas of the original x-com (many of which were sadly cut from Enemy Unknown) and adds a lot of meat to them. The ""geopshere"" world map phase of the game is particularly excellent. The aliens have a plan, and it's up to you to not only figure out what it is, but how to stop it.One of the greatest improvements is that the game is ""pause and play."" You can pause the game at any time (and the game will automatically pause when certain events occur, like spotting an enemy), and issue orders to your squad. Every action has a timer associated with it to tell you how long it will take to complete, rather than having action points and a ""you go, I go"" turn-based system. Things make a lot more sense as a result, and you can plan tactics without enemies taking their turn to run across gaps or cross the map without you being able to do anything about it since it's not your turn.It also lets you have multiple soldiers moving at the same time, and group-select and move orders, which means that the squad sizes and maps can be *far* larger without the game slowing to a crawl as you move an entire team one at a time down a hallway or street.The one thing I really miss that was in the original xcom which is missing from UFO: Aftermath is the environmental destruction and the interesting tactical options it provided. Also, this game was significantly superior to its own sequels."

Rather than the turn based combat previously seen in the likes of UFO: Enemy Unknown/Terror from the Deep etc. This is now a live RTS sytle of game often been used in more newer games such as Jagged Alliance. The combat has some cool little feature such as squad members automatically peaking around corners, and that eary feeling of trying to find that last alien.The tutorial sets the seen, of a lonely guy called Malcolm and his trusty shotgun. After the tutorial he and one other are trust into being in charged of combating this alian threat. As the team expands, so does the technology based, from simple kevlar sytle armour to power suits. From earth based weapons to the use of alien ones or just weilding miniguns! Bewarned that this is a game best played cautiously as combat is now quick and easy, and there can be a learning curve when facing various new aliens.The game follows a story line unlike its predecessors where the objective was getting to the enemy base. The story is basic, but there. The aliens are not your typical sectoid look with a large variety of some quite difficult species to bring down.A great new feature is the training of soldiers, though there is no determined way of controlling how stats increase, you can now train soldiers in certain specialities which align to their favoured skill. This adds another form of creating a more specialised and team with a personal touch.On the series I personally do prefer Aftershock, where you can read my next review on why!"

76561198021545252,Recommended,292160,17276620,"Posted: 28 July, 2015",all,mcsproot,"This game is alright. It's someone else's re-imaganing of the original XCOM games. The game is real time, but it can be paused whenever you want. There is a global map screen where you select missions, though they appear at random. UFO interception is purely RNG. You can have a dogfight end with all of your jets intact when they have no upgrades, and the same UFO can wipe out your squadron with full upgrades.In battles, your squad is limited to a maximum of 7. Soldiers gain generic XP for kills/KOs, and you can then choose which attribute to level up at the end of the mission if they get enough XP.There is no economy to speak of. Good for those just wanting to get into this type of game, but maybe a turn off to those who want micro-management. This game is certainly more macro-management on the globe screen, with micro-management for your soldiers (don't forget to pack extra ammo!).The aliens late game can be brutal. I get the feeling I'm doing something wrong or using the wrong weapons, but they can drop my soldiers in 2 hits even with the best armour. I'm using some of the strongest rifles in the game and it takes 10 hits to put them down.I'd give it a 6/10. Not a masterpiece, but enjoyable enough. I should also note, that this game does not fully support the Steam overlay. You can still access it, but key presses are still registered in game. So typing in chat leads to a load of key presses in game."
,Recommended,292160,22410162,"Posted: 14 April, 2016",all,Boltie,"Warning: This game is old, so it is ugly and will not even run at a proper resolution.Ufo Aftershock is pretty much similar to XCom (UFO Defense for the geoscape and real time Apocalypse for the battlescape) with the difference that the aliens already destroyed humanity and it's up to you to conquer Earth back and eventually save it from a devouring biomass.It is simple and fast paced. There is no economy so your choices are mostly about what you need the most and a good positioning of your military bases.The tactical layer offer various missions for your squads. A big plus for this game is that you do not need to kill all the enemies, some missions can be finished in two minutes if you know what you are doing. Plus, if you can skip missions by delegating them.You can equip your soldiers in various ways with grenades, rocket launchers, sniper rifles, shotguns and even slow but powerful collapsible railguns. All these weapons are good for their roles and you'll need to properly use them to win.The only big downside of this game is the weird difficuly curve. First it is really easy, but at a certain step of the story, the enemy gets suddenly really powerful. This gives the false feeling that the game is first too easy then impossible. Truth is that you only need to use all the tools you collected in the later half and, with a proper strategy, you can still win.So it's a good game that you should play if you are a fan of tactical games."

,Recommended,292160,9957119,"Posted: 27 April, 2014",all,krank23,"Really nice game that filled the gaping hole left after the various X-com failures after TFTD. Now, of course, we have a new ""true"" X-com game, but this little gem is still worth playing I think. It's not really turn-based like the older games (rather it uses a hybrid system with pausing) and it lacks some stuff in the micromanaging departement (like the ability to have and equip multiple ships to take care of multiple missions, etc) but it's still a bunch of fun.Like others have mentioned, it runs at a 4:3 resolution (1024x768) which means it stretches on most modern monitors. I was able to make my monitor not stretch it using the monitor's own menus. Great success! Now I can play fullscreen without stretching!Another little trick: Not sure if it's been documented, but I find scrolling in battle using Alt+Shift+mouse movement much easier and quicker than using the arrow keys. I just hate that ""camera inertia"" of the arrow keys and the slowness of using the screen borders. So Alt+Shift works for me."

I fell completely in love with it. The strategic thinking that it requires from the player is well balanced yet fun and engaging enough to be both fun and smart. The story and monologues might be a little cheesy, but in my opinion it makes the game more charismatic and funny.  If you have not played this game, do so. It costs just 4 euros mate, go for it."

,Not Recommended,292160,34284031,Posted: 16 August,all,Shutup868,"Enjoyable enough for the first few hours but just not a fun game as a whole. The game has terrible pacing and arbitrary difficulty, where you will see no new aliens or technology for months at a time as you easily roll over everything and then suddenly see a huge amount of new alien tech out of nowhere. Since your tech is immediately obseleted you're then extremely weak for the next few months until you can catch up, making all missions nearly impossible to do. The only thing to really do at this point is ignore all missions and just wait for your research and manufacturing to finish. The story is pretty neat though, I like it taking a twist on the typical X-COM story that these inspired games typically have."

If you want X-Com style gameplay, go get the original X-Coms, the new XCOMs, Xenonauts, Rebelstar: Tactical Command (okay, that last one is for Game Boy Advance, but still. Get it), or check out others.This game has some serious problems with its difficulty, and I've only been playing on Medium. Early on, it's way too easy. Gather your guys in one blob, roll them around the map, and concentrate fire on one enemy at a time.Later, the aliens start using explosives. Or fire. Or bees (not kidding). They will kill you in two, three hits tops. All of you. You will die. Think the aliens used grenades too much in X-Com? Buddy, those guys got NOTHING on the AOE-spamming aliens here.Tactical movement does not help. This only separates your guys, and makes it easier for them to die, alone, cold, and abandoned in an increasingly horror-filled world. You will not get any weapons that help you: the biggest, best guns still require you fire in Gettysburg-style vollleys, and half of those require you set them down, bolt them to the ground, and unfold them into a delicate origami flower of insufficent firepower.I will confess, without embarassment or shame, that I activated cheats to get through this game, just to finish the storyline. It is dull and without any characterisation. I've found more intriguing things on the nutrition facts panel of my cereal boxes.None of your men matter. You will not get attached. You will not feel pride in hard-fought victory. You will not feel sorrow at their tragic loss. You will be numb to the grind. You will feed man after woman after man into the beast of battle, never to see nor remember their faces. You will only be haunted by the memory their AGGRAVATINGLY BAD VOICE ACTING.This was a junkies' fix, trying to rekindle the feeling of the original X-Com: UFO Defense (Enemy Unknown in Europe). It was not worth my time. In fact, ranting about it here was the most enjoyment I'd gotten out of revisiting this old game.Put this one back in the closet, and let nostalgia drive you back to the originals."

Consider it a ""skip this mission"" button. The game would be enjoyable, but then things suddenly go horribly, horribly wrong...That little while ends when the game starts throwing aliens with mega green armor at you. On top of that, the aliens get rocket launchers, yellow death beams which drop you faster than you can say ""Well, time to reload a save,"" psi guns that incapacitate or possess your troops even if they have heroic willpower and psi-helmets, and these blue alien grenade launchers which do rapid-fire, mega-splash damage and can wipe out your entire squad in four shots.All the enemies in this game are somewhat creative but almost all are colored the same, dull, dusty gray. There's an enemy in  the game that looks like a giant larva which zaps your troops with a physically harmless purple beam which has a good chance of stunning them for an incredibly long time. Just one of these creatures can stunlock your entire squad permanently because they're also rapid fire, then you have to reload a save.I tried save-scumming my way through this game on easy mode, and I couldn't do it. I tried waiting in a corner and luring the enemies to get killed when they round the corner, and it still was insanely difficult. I had elite troops with high stats in all fields, with the best equipment I could get, and I still wound up reloading saves constantly, and still not being able to beat the campeign. The difficulty curve of this game is so strong, sudden, steep, and unforgivingly hard that it breaks the game into a near-unplayable state. My guess is that the developers decided to make the game more challenging not by adding new situations and tactics but by just making all the enemies stronger.In a nutshell, this game is just so ridiculously hard that it's not worth buying."
