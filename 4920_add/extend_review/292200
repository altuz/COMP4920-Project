76561198044410014,Recommended,292200,11550568,"Posted: 4 August, 2014",all,天阿,"First: this is an educational game that teaches the basics of genetics and plant breeding (dominant/recessive genes); a novel twist on Gregor Mendel's pea plant experiments (who makes an appearance).Pros: Unlike most children's games, it's gentle and not flashy; there's no hurry to speed through everything, and you really want to double check everything before it goes through (fortunately, the glossary to check scientific terminology is readily available).Soft pastel colours and a unique art style remind me of children's books of my parents' childhood. A lot of good memories are evoked in this game: the dress style of the characters is a fantastical blend of classical 18th century stiff frocks to a 1930s flapper style, the music is scratchy like an old record and hovers just at the edge of your perception. And I really appreciate well-written characters, subtle storytelling and good voice work: every character was charming and unique to me, and helping them out advanced their one-sided story a little further.Cons: The game is unforgiving if you burn all your money buying plants instead of breeding them, accepting orders you don't have the energy or money to fulfill, or buying upgrades too early in the game. The 'tutorial' day feels tedious, but it takes two minutes to speed-click through everything. It's also extremely short: a skilled gamer can chew this up in an hour, but the quick end (and super-low price - I bought this at 4 CAD) prevents the game from feeling tedious and worth the money.Also, I'd shoot the marketer who said ""crazy"" was a good descriptor for this game.* Edited after completing the game."
,Recommended,292200,11624927,"Posted: 9 August, 2014",all,Praxis-[CE],"Crazy Plant Shop actually reminds me a little of Cook Serve Delicious in that ""just one more day"" sort of addictive way, except it's about efficiency rather than speed. The key is trying to offer your customers the most combinations of plants using the least amount of breeding stock (pedestal space in your store) and mating attempts (energy). It's a fun little casual game that is challenging enough to keep you coming back for more, but not terribly difficult or stressful.The game uses scientific concepts and terminology, and features the use of Punnett square diagrams to determine the traits of the plants you are breeding to fill customer requests. It would be a great game for kids taking biology classes for the first time, but I think it's still pretty entertaining even for adults who are familiar with the science involved.The artwork is cute, and the plants are interesting and varied. The music's appropriate, but the voice acting is pretty cheesy and gets repetitive and grating after a while."

The game centers around you being a plant shop owner and you breed plans to have certain traits and it's your basic genetics. It kind of took me back to those times where I had to fill in the squares with what traits would carry on and what not. It was really fun for the few hours I put into it, extremely cute with the nice graphics.You carry out your day filling orders and breeding plants to make money to buy/unlock more plants and eventually the game ends when you unlock all of the plants and all of the traits. It was cute.Reccomended for casual gamers or someone just looking for something to do for a few hours."

The gamer in me wanted more to do - randomization, mutations, etc, to get more longevity out the game. But again, it was worth the price.Biggest flaw was the mediocre voice acting. Some of the characters were better than others, but some of the accents were noticeably fake, and one in particular was inconsistent and couldn't decide what it wanted to be."

I wish I had this game back in high school since this is a medium of learning that I would've been able to get into.It takes about 1-2 playthroughs to complete over the span of ~2 hours. The achievements are simple and easy to get provided you familiarize yourself with the game's 'tutorial' during the first day.I really liked this game.

,Recommended,292200,11557566,"Posted: 5 August, 2014",all,Whitemage87,"This game is definitely worth it, especially since it's on sale right now.I beat the game fairly quickly (it only lasts 13 ""days""), but I replayed it about 5 times, so that's gotta say something.The good:-The animation is nice-The music/sound effects are good-It's definitely worth the $4.99 (even better if it's on sale)-The characters are fully voiced-It's very cute-It's mildly educational, I definitely know more about genetics than I did when I started, and I already new a little going into it.-The customers are very patient, you can take all day to serve one if you really want.. however, you won't get a new one unless you accept the current one.-You can check your orders at any time (in case you forgot exactly what plant was needed) and even change which one is your ""active"" order.-You can upgrade your shop with a few different improvements-Steam trading cards, and achievements.The bad:-It can be a little confusing at first, especially if you're not familiar with simple genetics-The voice acting isn't the greatest (but at least it exists)-The dialogue (I use the term loosely) gets repetative, and I definitely found myself skipping through what people were saying, and just reading the quick tool-tip about what the order was that I needed to fill.-The tutorial doesn't explain some of the game mechanics, such as switching which order you're currently working on (a minor problem, but it did cause me a few issues)-The competitions you can enter have the same requirements every play-through, so if you have already won it once you can just do the exact same thing next time, and you know you'll win again.-There's no endless mode, or survival mode, or whatever you want to call it. So once the 13 days are up, you have to restart from the beginning if you want to keep playing.All-in-all this game was well worth the money, and the flaws were very minor. If you're a fan of tycoon-style games you'll most likely get some fun out of this, though it's definitely a lot more calm than some of those types of games. It would be very nice if there was an endless mode after you've beaten it, but even playing from the beginning again is fun, especially since it's fairly quick to play through the 13 days."
,Not Recommended,292200,11805290,"Posted: 21 August, 2014",all,Falcon,"Crazy Plant Shop is a decently entertaining game for a short amount of time, but is not by any stretch of your imagination worth paying for. As a game, it falls in the middle range of quality of games you could find easily for free on Kongregate or similar sites.First off, there is a very small selection of poor music. The voice acting is limited and at times cringe-worthy. There is only one game mode- a 13 day challenge to obtain all the plant types. There is no way to buy extra plant slots. Waiting on your character to walk around for everything and for the plant breeding machine to go ding takes up far too much time, which is pointless because the days are not on a timer. There is no penalty for rejecting customers or failing customers' orders that you accepted.Ultimately, there is just very little to this game. It's good, but there needs to be MORE. I can find good little games all day for free, and most of them have more depth and keep me entertained longer than Crazy Plant Shop could ever hope to.As a warning, note that there is no cross-breeding plants to create new, strange species. So if that's what you want to get the game for, don't bother."

(Who knew plants could meow or make music!) I admit I had to start the game over quite a few times before I figured out exactly what I needed to do to win. And the game really needs a ""skip tutorial"" option. Also, once you have a handle on things, it doesn't take that long to beat and grab all the achievements. With that said, I still recommend Crazy Plant Shop. It's cute, it's fun, and it's addictive. Even with all the achievements under my belt, I'm sure I'll still come back and play this again."

The landlord is Gregor Mendel, THE creator of the punnett squares, which I thought was pretty cool. When there was  a word that I haven't seen since school the dictionary option was particuarly helpful. The only downside to the game is that when you finally have 2 of each plant, both having one dominant and one recessive gene for each trait, any combination can be created, thus removing any challenges from the gameplay. Overall I found the game to be entertaining for a day and would recommend it to science/plant enthusiasts."

Diving into the science-y world of genetics through plant breeding is definitely amazing as well as great for the brain to think of how you're going to breed a specific hybrid for every customer that walks into your store. The voices are great, the characters are different and unique and amazing, and while they game is 'simple', it's still no walk in the flower fields because it really makes you think about how you're managing your orders and resources.

And it achieves its goals: it's recreative, smart, fun and snappy, you can learn few things about biology and having fun doing it.I guess the next step could be to add some mutation process in the gameplay: maybe a radioactive machine to get new genes, or spontanius evolutions.

At the beginning, you have very little room to learn and practice genetic combinations. With random orders, limited funds, and limited actions per day, it is very easy to go broke. While you can reject the least desirable orders to stay afloat, this habit leads to a clickfest by the end of the game, as you check and reject many orders just to get the best one.I still might use the game with my young nephews to introduce the concepts, but playing for more than 10-20 minutes got boring quickly."

I'm a grownup and enjoyed playing it; I found it very relaxing! Another friend has been enjoying playing it with her 11-year-old son. It's simple, but it's nice, and takes some strategizing!"

It doesn't dumb down its topic and within the first few minutes I saw enough scientific terms to scratch my brain trying to remember old biology lessons. Thankfully, there is sufficient in-game explanation to help you out.A single run takes about 2 hours and I found that exactly the right length for what the game has to offer. It's enough to figure out how to make the most of dominant-recessive genes and keeping an efficient plant stock, but without feeling like you're repeating yourself. You can do another 1 or 2 runs after that, e.g. for some achievements or secondary goals that you may have missed, but that is pretty much it.The price of the game reflects this duration, so I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who wants to run a shop with cute-looking plants and simultaneously conducting genetic science."

Buy it as a birthday gift for your children or nephew/nieces; buy it for those friends who've only ever played Facebook games; buy it for yourself for a pint-sized period of playful plant-puzzling. The game's children's-book-style illustrations lends itself further to a G-Rated experience accessible and friendly to all, and the puzzle mechanics are very easy to learn.The game is also lightly educational in that it'll teach you about alleles (gene pair members) and about a dozen genetics titbit-facts while you breed plants. But largely, this is a game about pattern management and minorly about money management.The game itself is short; it took me about 2.5 hours at most to finish the game the first time, and you'll have seen all its content in that time too. Plus, there are only a few ways of succeeding within the game so you'll have a mostly linear experience. Frankly, this game feels more like an experiment for a new puzzle format, dipping its toe to test how many players like it.However, do note that at most, this game is only at most USD$5, a bargain price for a game that's quick to pick up and get into.For a long plane/train ride, or for when you're away from the internet, or for laptops that need games that're simpler and less graphics-intensive, Crazy Plant Shop is a delightful snack of a game that'll please your eyes and raise your spirits."

It's very simple with only one criterion to continue your jourmey: have 10g to pay your rent each day.  Other than that, just get heterozygotes for the plant you're working on and upgrade breeding power early.  Simple and relaxing, but no replayability if you win first time.You can tell that the creation was pretty simple.I recommend it if it's on sale or you have a child that wants to learn about genetics or likes plants or shop games."

Each day you can breed a limited number of plants and the game is 13 days. This discourages you from experimenting with the genetics and forces you to fill orders as efficiently as possible. The punnett square is a joke. You put plants in a machine and select which trait you want to result. All of the traits have one dominant and one recessive gene, so you can keep two heterozygous plants and breed any result needed. The customers have quirky dialogue but there's no sequence to it. I had one character complain I sold plants to another character I hadn't met. By the last day, almost all of the dialogue was repeated."

It's fairly easy but a nice way to relax and see some genetic magic happen.Only downside is that I wish there would be a game mode where you could keep going indefinetily- didn't really get that much time to check out all the plants and combinations. A gallery or something would also be nice.I bought it on sale, worth the money but I wouldn't pay much more for it seeing how it feels a bit lacking (only 12 days before the game ends)."

After completing the main story you should be able to continue creating plants and things. Its a great game but usually when I get the last plant its the last day and I have spent the last of my energy. Otherwise its just what I was looking for

I enjoyed the characters, the fun plant designs, and the game idea. However, the game is too restrictive on expanding the store, making purchases or selling crossbred plants back for profit.  I would only buy full price if I were using it to teach my kids and I couldn't wait, otherwise, buy it on sale."

Once you realize how to manipulate inheritance through what I call the ""gene box"" then the game becomes much more enjoyable. My only gripe is that you are really limited on how many times you can cross breed in a day even with all upgrades and I wish I had more store space. Hint: Customers will completely forget about plant types once you fill enough orders of that type so get ready to sell often once you survive that plant's popularity. Buy during a sale though."
