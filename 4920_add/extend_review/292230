Unfortunately, and to my knowledge it is still unclear to non-users willing to purchase, the software as of now only authorizes usage of its contents for ""RPG Maker"".What does that mean?It means that you won't be able to use Character Hub production for your 2D Games, not in any way.At least if you are not a pixel art designer. And if you are a pixel art designer, I wonder what use could be Character Hub to you as you would combine your tiles and sprites on Photoshop for about the same results.The game descriptiom says that ""the elements found in the program should work with other 2D game engines as well."" As of now it adds that ""RPG Maker assets are for RPG Maker use only"". But even some months after, the software only contains assets from RPG Maker! This means that you cannot use it in any game of yours, unless you make a RPG-Maker-RPG. I've googled for other 2D resources for Character Hub to no avail. If you know any legal resource library that we may use for our own games (and not something restrictive like RPG Maker), please tell!The software should be renamed as ""Character Hub for RPG Maker"" ; as of now, although a very nicely made software, it ends almost as a scam for programmers willing to use it for their own games. It's very unfortunate as I am sure Character Hub programmer, an indie, has worked on this software, but it needs clarification and efforts to get some license-free resources."
76561197991567326,Recommended,292230,10225416,"Posted: 24 May, 2014",all,Moonfairy,"I have used Photoshop for my custom spriting and animation, but just got this today and found this to be very much helpful in making my animation aligned properly and framed appropriately (I use RPG maker VX ACE, btw). Before, it didn't look bad when I tested my current custom sprites' movements, but this shows me all the directional movements along side each other in the proper frames and it shown me a big difference in the alignments of my previous sprites. Something I would've never noticed, otherwise! And it updates the preview as you work on it.I highly recommend this as an addition to sprite animation editing, especially if you want to make custom edits, even if they are not the traditional xp/vx size :) It'll let you know if the current grid sizing isn't optimal for what you have (I had imported a custom sheet and though it just barely worked in game, it wasn't the proper size till I fixed it). I may still use my photoshop program for stuff like scenes, very large stuff or minimal to no animated sprites, but this is my new favorite for most character spriting. I also love the ability to layer clothing, hair and items, separating them individually, this is a plus :D And the price is really great, too. Especially compared to another program here on Steam that does something similar. Fortunately it doesn't matter to me if there's limited resources included as I've got tons I've collected and many I plan to make anyways.Update (and further/clarification tips): Yes, you can adjust the amount of frames to what you need and create a template for more sprites that work in a ""similar"" manner, if needed. When adding, it'll ask if you want to scale the frames to match, depending on what it is, you would want to select for it to not match so it'll expand properly. Unless it does match, of course (may have to test variations out to be sure). On some clarifications in my post, when I tested my sprites before using this, I was testing animation in photoshop and using the actual rpg maker vx ace engine to test if the sprite would work correctly in it, which was time consuming and ineffecient in itself, since I have to go between programs. Also when I tried to import my ""finished"" sprite that was made beforehand, it shown me that the framing size wasn't correct (particularly in the middle column, thus cannot be imported properly, if at all), I had to correct it in photoshop by expanding it with the 32px grid sizing requirement to match the outer two columns. This program is best for those that either has a bunch of resources to import/work with or those who are creating their own templates, etc. Even if something isn't aligned right, it's not that hard to go in and make adjustments, just select the layer and make the adjustments. It's a slight learning curve, but not hard to work out. The other program I saw on Steam, cost over/around $100, so this is a great deal once you know how to work it."

Make your charter, import the pose you want and start cutting and adjusting your character to fit over the imported one and your done in ten minutes or less. Want to mix two tile sets together without risking messing up the format? Just use the grid system to copy past what tiles you want into the corresponding area.

The ""save as diffferent hues"" option is great. It lets you pickwhich elements of your sprite get recolored and spits out a bunch of randomly colorsprites. It will also convert from various formats. Sure, converting XP style to VX styleby hand isn't hard, but this just makes it easy and error free.You can also import parts for the generator. For example, I took the taira accessory fromthe VX ACE RTP character generator and imported it in as a library piece. Now I can have atiara on any character I create.With the amount of time and work this tool will save me, it's a great deal. Even at full price."

It's cheaper and more streamlined than Photoshop. (That's what I was using before.) It's very easy to set up the grid so you can rearrange and edit tiles, too. I'm well versed with Photoshop and GIMP. But GCH is a great tool because it's so specialized for 2D spriting. You can see a walk cycle preview, for example. It can convert sprites from XP to Ace so they fit the number of frames. It can even handle the old 2000 and 2k3 sprites. It features random sprite generators that are easy to customize and set up. Some people expected it to have ""behavior"" bases and corresponding parts, for animations or poses, like dancing or collapsing. It doesn't. (I have no idea where that expectation came from. At least one person already made a ""down"" base.  Just consult the internet.)Yes, VX Ace has a built-in character generator, but you can't even adjust colors without an outside editor. GCH allows much more freedom for what parts you're able to use and how you can layer them. The resource sets it comes with are for RPG Maker XP and VX Ace. (If licensing is an issue because you're using some other engine, you can always import your own sprite parts...)Now, this might not be the best tool for making a sprite entirely from scratch, for a number of reasons. But it's probably one of the best options for editing sprites or piecing them together. If the price is too steep for you, just wait for a sale."

While RPG making tools often come with their own standard characters, it can really set a game apart if the game uses custom designed characters.  But, for those of us like me who lack the ability to create custom character portraits and character sprites, Game Character Hub is a godsend.Basically, when you start the tool you create a type of character.  Then you pick pieces from the proper character type, select them, and shift their order around, until the character looks right.  The character (or face portrait) is shown in the lower left-hand corner, so you can quickly see what your result looks like.Once you have a character, you can export it to use in the game or save the particular character, so you can re-load and edit it later.    This is a huge help, in case the character doesn't look exactly right, or if you want to make a similar character later.And, what if you want a slew of similar characters?  Say you want a lot of minor NPCs that look just a bit different?  Game Character Hub has you covered there.  With one special Export command, you can create dozens or hundreds of characters (or faces) which vary in color (such as hair color, eye color, clothing color), all from a single template.  This is a great way to fill in the roster of minor NPCs, very quickly.Overall, it's an invaluable tool for character creation and I highly recommend it."

Why?PROS:- have many character and face portrait parts...- layering, hue and otherpaint.netoptions...- animation preview...- Steam Workshop (didn't tried that out, but some objects look nice, but a developer shouldn't rest on those)CONS:- ...that you can find all in the specific RPG Maker- ...butpaint.netis free- ...that sometimes doesn't appear and sometimes it does (don't see a pattern there)- you need to close the programm with the Task Manager in Windows 8.1 64 Bit (else steam say's forever GameCharacter Hub is still running)- the RPG Maker XP is a mess, every single part needs to be moved manual, because nothing fits- easy things are really laborious to do, like mark pixels, mark cells (much easier onpaint.net)CONCLUSION:I hope I mentioned all above, but all in all I can't recommend it. The RPG Maker VX/Ace editor is decent, but nothing special. Most parts are in the Character Generator of VX ACE, only 1 or 2 are from the GCH itself. For that pricing I really expect more, because there are free tools that are easier to use and have all the options GCH has. If you plan buying it for XP, then don't do it, every part needs to be moved manual!!!Probably the rating would be better, if ""Second Story"" would be implemented in the GCH and didn't cost another 3,99€ normal price or at the moment 2,99€.

,Recommended,292230,28897619,Posted: 1 January,all,rontifu,"First, Disclaimer. I bought this without knowing about the supposed MV Update, I bought this for VX Ace. Therefore, my review will not talk about this update, but rather the software itself, used by me for VX Ace (As I didn't use other versions of RPGMaker)This Game Character Hub is exactly what it says it is: in short, it's an upgraded version of the Character Generator from RPGMaker. There's some very useful features in here that you cannot find in the Character Generator from RPGMaker: changing to color of various parts to exactly the color you want, moving some pieces, layering different clothes/body parts for your own amusement. With this tool, and a little imagination, you could make your game having entirely different NPCs, not one will look exactly the same. It's a big plus for me who always disliked how in various RPGs, several NPCs always had some long lost identical twins scattered through the world.Pros:Tutorial when you start the program for the first time. USE IT.Ability to generate 100 characters at most with a simple click. Just choose basic characteristics, and you have your characters.Change color hue/Saturation/Lightness.Ability to move/create parts. Want a green alien with 6 eyes? Easy to do.Possibility to add extra parts in the generator. Always useful.Cons:Even if it's a convinient program, there's nothing here that you cannot do in picture modifier programs. Everything I've tested here, I could do on GIMP (even if it takes me more time)I do not know if I didn't find it, but so far, there is no way to create a face and making a Sprite generates itself along the face. It's one thing RPGMaker Character Creator has over GCH.I got this software on sale, and I figure it's worth the money I spent. I would recommand it on sale only though. Like I said, everything you can do here, you can do elsewhere. It will only take you more time to do. The price you pay is the price for speed and convinience."

There are a few pros and a few cons to it, even though I haven't used it for very long, but all in all, it's a really good editing program, especially if you use the RPG maker systems. The biggest problem I have is layering--sometimes you'll have to move them around so that way hair/clothing/etc. shows up as it's supposed to, and the fact that I have to change the opacity every time I use the eyedropper tool. It wants to default the opacity to some where around 50%? Like, no, this needs to be solid. But it's still a really good program. I'm not sure what other problems people have experienced, but I don't think I've experienced them.

It uses the exact same resources, and so the sprites you can make are nearly identical, save for maybe a few color variations, if you can figure that out, and the faces are no less creepy. I had really been hoping to make better sprites and face sets with this...That said, you can also make custom sprites for RPGMaker XP, which is kind of cool. Most of the assets for XP are not gender specific, so odds are you'll end up with a female villager who looks like a guy.
