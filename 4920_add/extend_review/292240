However, I lost the disk to this game a long time ago, so I was very happy to see it on steam. I feel Spy Fox is the most challenging in the series, with Putt-Putt probably being the easiest. I feel growing up with these games greatly benefited my problem solving skills. Highly recommended, especially if you have children. Also, I have played and beaten all of these games, so if you’re stuck feel free to ask me x3"

This was the first one I ever had, and in my opinion, it has aged gracefully. I definitely appreciate it a lot more now than I did then, because I've seen James Bond movies now :PI wouldn't recommend it to older people who had never played it before, but if you're wondering whether or not the nostalgia is worth it--or if you're considering it for your kids-- it's a must."

Some include cloning food or getting through a super small home.2.Gameplay mechanics are the same as in Dry Cereal but our now used a bit more. We interrogate more people and use more gadgets.3.This one has 2 routes as well. I will be playing the second route after competing one of he routes in the 3rd game.4.Puns, references, and jokes are still quality.ConsThere are no cons this time, but let's go into some more deep information on the game instead of the gameplay.StoryThis time we must go up against a pint sized terrorist who plans on using a Evil Dog-Bot for world domination. Apparently once the 1,000,000 customer enters the world fair it activates. Wait what the ♥♥♥♥ Leroach. 1,000,000 customers before you get this♥♥♥♥♥♥on the road. Why not just click a button that turns the Robot on.You're probably wondering why he wants to do this. What is the tragic backstory behind this.At the age 5 his mother threw him in a trash can. Out of pain he decides to commit acts of terrorism against innocents. I'm just ♥♥♥♥ing around. It's not anything like it. He couldn't get on ""The 'Creamiest' Ride"" because he was too short to get to the turnstyle.So he wants to use this Dog-Bot to get his revenge on turnstyles murdering thousands of innocent civilians in the process.Listen we dont want this to happen. So to shut off this sonuva ♥♥♥♥♥ we need to get through a breath analyzer. fingerprint detector, and a code as well as finding and obtaining the off switch hidden in the park.So basically he shoves it in a Venus Flytap's mouth and ships it off to Madame Ladybug (Dont Remember her name) instead of a beautiful rose he promised. Why. Cause ♥♥♥♥ her thats why.The code is found by some fish lady but oh no her connection is all staticy so we have to find her in Wee World a exhibit for tiny cities.How do we get through the breath analyzer and fingerprint detctor you may ask. Figure it out yourself.Anyway this game is good and definitly worth your cold hard cash especially if you played it before and are looking for a nostalgasm.Enjoy my friends and enemies. And frenemies. And aquaintences. And people I have never met."

The game play and conecpt is similar to the previous game except with new characters, situations, and locations to interact with. The World's Fair is a very active place to check out in the game. I can tell the writers had fun coming up with the idea of the place that's on par with Disney's Tomorrowland and the New York World's Fair. The jokes and dialoge are just as clever as heard in the first game, and the characters are a great cast. If you love this first game, then you will like this one just as much.

,Not Recommended,292240,23320773,"Posted: 31 May, 2016",all,Double Uppercut,"I've never played this Spy Fox game before. Ever. I always wanted to as a kid, but the furthest I got to playing it was in a demo attached to Spy Fox 3. So, there are absoulely no nostalgia-goggles on me for this review.But, unfortunately, like the first Spy Fox, I didn't enjoy this game either.As a follow-up to Dry Cereal, this game is a little bit better in a few ways. It doesn't just show the villain and give him screentime at the end. LeRoach is given some fleshing out (though it doesn't make ANY sense, how a kid denied entrance to a fair and getting laughed at would lead him to join an evil organization and want to take over the world). The humor is much better in this game as well. Spy Fox was still annoying as hell with his snide comments, but I enjoyed the other sight gags and the repeating joke where a chatacter would slide into the screen and say, ""S.M.E.L.L.Y. Oh yes. Our arch-nemesis,"" had me laughing several times.But with those positive comments, comes my slew of negative ones. For one, I think this choice of location is MUCH lazier than Dry Cereal. It's a cool World Fair, but there's so little to it and it's so aesthetically uninteresting that it got boring to me really fast.Also, similarly to Dry Cereal, the villain's plan seemed really stupid to me. How would relying on precisely 1,000,000 people cranking a turnstile to enter a fair which would crank a giant mechanical dog could possibly work. How would you know if the stadium could hold a million people? How would you know a million people would come? How do you know your robot is durable enough to destroy an entire planet? Doesn\'t world domination require a successful leadership instead of... rampant destruction? In the words of Tony Stark, ""Not a good plan.""The whole S.M.E.L.L.Y. plot didn't really go anywhere either. They mention it several times, and it made for some good jokes... but really in the end it's just LeRoach doing his own thing.However, the whole ""ticking clock"" plot allowed for a very Pajama Sam-esque plot development influenced by the gameplay itself. It's not as linear as Dry Cereal. Every piece you get to deactivating the robot dog increases the drive for completion. It's much more organic for a player to get involved in the story, and I prefer it to the archetypal Humongous plots.But, you saw the thumbs down. And because you liked the game and saw I didn't, that means you're going to downvote my review, even though I gave my legitimate points for disliking it. Even worse, you won't leave a comment telling me why you disagree with my review. I'd happily accept arguments, but this is the internet so ho hum.In spite of everything, Some Assembly Required is a better Spy Fox installment than the last game. But I still personally didn't enjoy it. I'm not saying that you shouldn't enjoy it because I didn't. I'm saying that I didn't for my own reasons. I'm giving Spy Fox 2 a 6/10."
