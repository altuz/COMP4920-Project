Has your good old fashioned 60's style destroy things for the fact that you can villian. Good pun humor, and if you've played any of this companies games in the past before, a warm fuzzy feeling of joy that you can not get from any of the best street drugs money can buy. Do I recommend? I go beyond and demand you get this. Also you should just turn off the tape before it ends....TOO LATE *BOOM*"

There were hundreds of jokes, comic scenarios and conversations which made it (to me at least) one of the most charming games in existence. However, the puns, one-liners and charm of 'Dry Cereal' have been compromised in 'Operation Ozone', instead leaving our titular character awkwardly didactic and explanatory in situations that he would otherwise be comedic and interesting.""But why the positive review?""Regardless, this game is exactly the way I remember it in my childhood, and at least in terms of gameplay, it's still an absolute treat to play. The novel gadgets and quirky scenarios are there in abundance (greater so than the first). And playing a second time will reward with with an alternate story, a testament to the care placed into making this game. The art style and music are cohesive and the game world truly is filled with interesting and funny characters; but its always going to be overshadowed by the first game, a comparison which becomes more stark with age.7/10"

Replayed them and played a few new ones. Remember everything from Operation Ozone as I still have that one with me today. Love the voice acting and it has been updated so really good.

I really miss hearing the suave Dutch voice, instead of this more wacky English one. Finished it in about two hours, which is shorter than I remember from the other two games in the series, but still got my moneysworth."
,Recommended,292260,10542861,"Posted: 19 June, 2014",all,FeistyGreenSnake,"Even now, Spy Fox still remains one of my most favourite foxes on the block. But seriously, the game has great voice acting, amazing animations and graphics, dramatic background music and effect noises to entice all ages and make the scenes better, and enough gameplay (dialogue and games included within) to keep a person occupied for about 3 hours long.Considering this is a children's game and over 10 years old, it is more than worth the few pounds on Steam. However, to be fair as a reviewer, although this game in the Spy Fox series is the longest one made, it is likely that you will remember how to solve most of the puzzles after one playthrough. Nonetheless, the major puzzles (i.e. codes on blocks, hairdo's, etc) change with every playthrough, keeping the game interesting once you've completed it once.Overall, I would highly recommend this game. It'll keep a child interested, mainly through Spy Fox's laughable humour and the interesting puzzling solving, whilst it's dramatic sound effects and plot are detailed enough to keep an adult intrigued as well. Besides, who wouldn't enjoy seeing a humorous fox in a dandy suit ;)"

Just with all the weird and funny stuff that goes on is just entertaining and makes you want to play more since the story sometimes isn't the same. It's still a very good nostalgic game to play again if you've ever played this game in your childhood. Or even if you just want to try it out, it's still a great time consuming-ish game."

Embark on a journey of love, betrayal, and really good puns.  I beat this game in 2 hours and you should too as long as you find the cheat code called ""playing the game"".  Grab your fight stick and graph sheets because you need careful planning if you want any chance of finding out who framed Roger Rabbit.Also bowling is required to win, this may upset some people."

,Recommended,292260,23565187,"Posted: 14 June, 2016",all,Double Uppercut,"Well, after all this looking, I've finally found it!I finally found a Spy Fox game that I enjoyed, and can completely recommend.Spy Fox 3: Operation Ozone is the thrilling conclusion to the Spy Fox trilogy, and what a wild ride it has been! I was surprised to find out that LeRoach was actually Spy Fox's uncle, and pulling MobCo's strings from the start. And while in this entry in the trilogy there's some odd choices, like a romance between Billy the Kid and Moneypenny, and delving into Professor Quack's childhood, but I feel like it helped flesh out the story a lot more. And the return of Russian Blue right at the end was a nice touch to tie everything together.Of course, you realize I'm kidding, don't you?Spy Fox 3 concludes the Spy Fox trilogy in no way related to the previous games, barring the exceptions that they follow Spy Fox beating a maniacal villain, and there's some slight nods to Spy Fox 1 and 2 here and there, but not enough that it becomes annoying. In fact, this game improves even more than Spy Fox 2 did over Dry Cereal.Spy Fox 3 has a massive gallery of devices this time, and some gadgets that might potentially never be used for a playthrough. You also can control Spy Fox's spy car and drive across the planet to the four most well-known worldwide landmarks: Street... Jungle... Desert... and Lake. All very important in the history of humanity.However, what I felt was lacking Spy Fox Uno and Dos, that Tres has done so much better is that, the world (while large) isn't completely isolated with its puzzles. There might be something you need in order to finish a puzzle in a different area, so you'll be transporting across the globe between locations so much to the point, that you start to wonder how long Spy Fox has been spending driving to all these place and how much time there really is left on the massive aerosol can. But each area you visit is beautifully colored and drawn. I love the way each location looks, and how the character fit so much better in them, than the bland worlds of Acidophilus and the World Fair.On top of that, the music in this game is actually pretty good. You won't be humming the tunes after you beat the game, but they each fit to their own areas nicely. Even though the African deserts have a western guitar sound, and the Russian lake has northern banjos playing.Another complaint I had with the previous entries were the villains and their plans. Between Billy the Kid trying to blame cows for flooding the world with milk, and LeRoach relying on precisely 1,000,000 people to wind up his doomsday device, it's nice to see that Poodles Galore actually has something of a slow-burning ""Death Star"" aerosol can floating over the earth to slowly deplete the ozone layer. It isn't the most sensical, but I think it better fits a villain's master plan than the incredibly stupid ones from the previous entries. And I liked Poodles as a character. She played off that make-up diva angle that I'd never seen as a James Bond villain parody before, and I thought she was funny.The humor in this game is a lot more visual now, too. Spy Fox spouts his annoying puns here and there, but a lot of jokes are sight gags, and are legitimately funny. Jokes have set ups and pay-offs through the character's interactions, because I think the Humongous budget went somewhere into the animation. This is probably one of the best looking and best animated HE games I've played in the library thus far.Spy Fox 3: Opertation Ozone has that perfect blend of child-like charm, spy thriller action, and good humor to provide an experience that I believe is well worth the price of admission. It succeeeds in gameplay and story far more than the first two Spy Fox games, and the puzzles are much more intricately laid out this time around. I'm giving this game a 7/10. It's nice to see that Spy Fox ended on a high note before he went out."

I love the characters, the environments, the music, the puzzles, the gadgets, the dialogue. The story is pretty good, it's your basic save the planet plot. Oh and the ""11 original SPY songs"" were a cool bonus. Shame you don't get the CD audio version of them with this release (or even the 2 bonus tracks). Overall feels like a worthwhile conclusion to a long gone, but not forgotten franchise."

In fact I never even knew Spy Fox had a third game until I saw the Humoungus Games on Steam. Still its a game that was really fun to play through. The parodys still hold up and the enviroments were fun to explore. So yes this is one that would defenitly be a recommendation.
76561198088380930,Recommended,292260,23746077,"Posted: 23 June, 2016",all,emasterslake,"Spy Fox 3 was the final installment of the Spy Fox franchise and the most ""James Bond"" Spy Fox game ever made. In Spy Fox's final outing he must prevent global warming as a giant space station is spraying harmful vapors to the ozone layer. The culprit is a cosmetics CEO named Poodles Galore(obivious parody to Honor Blackman's character from Goldfinger). With the acessment of newer gadgets and a network of helpful agents, Spy Fox must not only infiltrate Poodle's hideout but also go on a global trek to find items he needs to destroy the space station. With the appearance of Roger Boar and the jukebox filled with James Bond parody titles, this game will amuse die hard James Bond fans and will also delight Spy Fox & Humongous Entertainment fans alike. Out of the primary titles of Spy Fox, this was the only one that had a villianess instead of a villian. While it was true that Russian Blue was the main antagnogist in Cheese Chase, that one was a spin-off  arcade game that didn't utilize the point and click scenario. Which comes into conclusion that like Pajama Sam, Spy Fox is a fun series that both kids and adults will enjoy. Don't miss out on it."
,Recommended,292260,21179883,"Posted: 13 February, 2016",all,it grows on trees,"The only one I had no nostalgia about. Still a masterpiece.Pros:1.Puzzles. The Puzzles for this one can actually get pretty difficult. My favorite one was probably the Chicle Puzzle or the X-Y Donut Ingredients Puzzle. <You'll know what that means if you play it. Puzzles are fun as always. Not too easy not too hard.2.Gameplay Mechanics. We still have the ability to interrogate people about things as well as several interesting but absurd gadgets. Overall gameplay plays just as well as the previous two games.3.Paths And Endings. As with the two previous installments of the Spy Fox series there are two paths leading to the same ending and a hidden ending. I'll be after that hidden ending soon.4.Humor. Although not as good in jokes and puns as the previous installment this game definitly still hits the humor mark just fine. Some of the humor is a bit edgy; like a joke about cops and donuts as well as this psychopath who talks to her sock puppets. I applaud them for their minor risks.5.Pocket System. The Pocket System has improved just a smidge. In the previous installment you had the gadgets pocket, the interrogation pocket, and one pocket for each individual item. In Operation Ozone all the items are instead in one singular pocket together.6.Spy Car System. This was something I really enjoyed that they added to the game. In previous installments the Spy Car was only used for puzzles but now it is used as an actual vehicle for getting from place to place. It can be used to travel between The Street, The Jungle, The Desert, and The Lake. I thought this was a very nice touch.Cons:1.The 5 or 6 minute intro is kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm not gonna lie, i did not enjoy the short beggining. Too hard to follow and just extremely abnormal. Maybe a bit too abnormal.Story:So this time we're up against a poodle who dresses and wears makeup like some sort of rich♥♥♥♥♥♥ Her plan is to use the APD to destroy the ozone layer. This will of course cause immediate threat of genocide, so people will have to line up to by her sunscreen; SPF 2001. Of course buisness goes as usual in Spy Corp and we must stop this crazy ♥♥♥♥♥. Through a world of Indiana Jones references, James Bond references, absurd gadgets, strange characters, beauty, and cosmetics we must stop Poodles Galore. Yes that is her name... Poodles Galore."
