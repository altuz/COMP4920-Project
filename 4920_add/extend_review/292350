,Recommended,292350,9728350,"Posted: 4 April, 2014",all,The doctor is in,"Just picked it up today and did up to and including video 2 of 11 videos and so far it's been great and an with a most amazing price to boot!S2 covers advanced topics and takes you beyond where S1 leaves off. So if you have not already done S1 go get it and it it first and then do S2. The great thing is right now S1 is like $2 so pick both up to lock in the saving and do S1 which will take you a good amount of time since its huge easily 3x longer than S2 and then after completely finishing S1 do S2.Honestly you won't get videos, tutorials, starter unity projects for this kind of money anywhere. You will easily pay $25, $50 or more... He covers things step by step and completely. Not like on many websites which drop leave you in the middle of a topic and then they never get around to finishing it and go to some other topic in fits in starts... Not here...He gives you every thing you need and walks you step by step through the subject matter in the videos.Plus the new steam launcher the he's uses for S2 is is so much better than the original one that he used in S1 and it makes it so much easier to get to the the different content that comes with S2.Not only do you get videos with step by step instructions, but you get complete source code and project files and notes and also exectubables and the rights to use them in your game.So I can't wait to when I can watch the upcoming videos and learn how he did those things and compare it to how I've been doing them and others have been doing them...I will update this review as I progress through the totorials, but so far I whole heartenly recommend S2 its takes you from where S1 left off into more advance topics that anyone contemplating creating a video game using Unity will need to learn."

I learned almost everything in unity from these tutorials. If you want to learn how to make a game this is definitely a must-have!"

,Recommended,292350,10760275,"Posted: 24 June, 2014",all,Bisu[Shield],"The Gamer To Game Developer series is one of the most informative and thorough Unity3D tutorials around in my experience. If you want to learn about how to make multiplayer games I would highly recommend this product. The first season is also very good and teaches basics about the Unity engine as well as some more advanced topics, so pick that up too if you haven't already. Being this cheap anyone can afford it and even if the price was higher it would still be worth every last cent."

I recommend you also get the S1 series if your starting out as it's got soooo many examples and pointers to help give you a flying start.....very nice work GTGD!

You may be wondering how this is possible, but I assure you it is. I tapped into the quantum field and delivered all of his knowledge to him while he slept, he peacefully accepted this, and used it without my knowing. he is just rehashing my knowledge into a whipped up pile of doggy do do"

,Recommended,292350,16719643,"Posted: 26 June, 2015",all,Reizla,"Awesome tool that shows how to build a framework for a 3D game including the server step by step. The project includes the sources used as well as a lot of videos to explain what's been done.One warning though, this project uses Unity 4.3.4 (download link included) and that one is a bit outdated. Chances are that with the latest release of Unity (5.1 at the moment) the examples won't be working anymore."

I seen your work on guild, I was wondering if you your thinking of doing some RTS stuff like c&c. I see alot of tutorial of them, but there horrerable. I believe this would be a very interesting add to the GTGD. love the learning format, you have for teaching people."
