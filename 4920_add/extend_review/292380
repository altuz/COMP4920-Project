That said, it's a mediocre iOS port that has given me some issues already.  Note that the game is free on the AppStore (iPad and iPhone), but with in-app purchases.  Wish I searched more about this before purchase."

Yes believe it or not, This is a puzzle game. Yiou are not racing. The only thing what you are doing is switching puzzle pieces of Road together so that your car (which is driving automatic) is able to ride on it. If a road is not connected it will Crash because the driver is stupid enough to keep driving forward in his slow pace. Which means you have to restart over.Graphics is bad.Music is bad and annoying after awhile.Camera is bad.Able to pause the game.Only left mouse button is required.TOO EXPENSIVE!Other things.Highscore is totally hacked. Wow! this is the first time right?Just a big no. This isn't a racing game. This isn't worth your money, This isn't worth your steam badge. Just don't buy it.-------------------I Give this game a 2/10"
,Not Recommended,292380,26458868,"Posted: 6 November, 2016",all,Bob Spigot,"One of the worst designed games Ive ever seen, thats not an exageration. There are obviously worse games in existence but to fail so spectacularly on every conceivable level at what is essentially Pipe Mania with a twist...Where do I even begin?-It deliberately obfuscates your view so you cant see whats happening with the track. (because what puzzler isnt improved by putting a load of crap in the way?)-The game will change tiles around which would be only a minor annoyance if it didnt constantly change the tile your car is just about to enter which just straight up kills you. (At one point it marked the very next tile for change so I had no choice but to go in to it and hope, I thought Id get across it before the change, but the tile switched while my car was wholly on top of it instantly destroying me...)-The shop contains items that largely do nothing but attempt to mitigate the terrible design choices of the main game.-You can buy new cars but the differences are barely noticable and the stats make no sense.-It has a variety of odd bugs like music tracks playing over each other, menus locking up, and periodic hangs.-Navigating the menu is an unresponsive nightmare in the first place. (Im not using a tablet you clowns, optimise your damn game if you want to sell it at four times the price on PC to subsidise your mobile crap.)-There is no aerial view in the camera angles and it resets the angle every game.-The list of your statistics are all wrong. (0 refuels? Not quite right...)-Try to get a better view of the course and it actually starts fogging out parts, which is apparently a feature.-If you run out of fuel as you get to the finish line the game doesnt know what to do with itself.-If you crash a huge crash logo comes up blocking your view. (Given the way it has a tendency to screw you up by changing tiles itd be nice to actually see what cheap crap the game pulled on you this time.)-25 levels in and they are all basically identical. It changes only in how many dumb things are getting in the way of you seeing what the hell is going on, and how long you have to put up with the frustration of playing the game.-Several times I collected every fuel icon that came up promptly and still ran out before the end.-Blue tokens you use to buy the upgrades that make the game at all playable are accrued at an insanely tedious rate while each upgrade can be lost in an instant setting you back dozens of games worth of collecting them each time.-Instant setting back dozens of games? Yeah, because all your upgrades are taken away the moment you crash for any reason including all of the unavoidable broken crashes Ive already mentioned.-In game power up items like fuel are sometimes trapped by the random way in which the board changes so you drive around for the next minute or so hoping for the board to change in a way that will let you collect it while slowly and inevitably leading up to you breaking down.-When I bought auto driver and changed some tiles to build a route to go down it switched the route already laid out causing the car to crash instantly. (It did actually give me a bit of a laugh, but I cant give the game a pass for being literally laughably terrible.)-Even though I had the tokens and some of the shop items are only available in the game, at no point would it let me buy them. Not while playing, not after a crash, not after running out of fuel. Sometimes I could, sometimes I couldnt.This is not an exhaustive list; I could go on (Scoreboard is messed up), and on (About page has broken overlapping text), almost every aspect has a half dozen levels of awful to get through. The entire approach appears to be 'Make the game as frustrating and broken as possible, then have them retry it dozens of times in order to buy ""upgrades"" that return the game to a semblance of playability.' This game type was perfected almost 30 years ago. This demonstration of how badly you can screw it up is almost impressive.At full price youd have to be profoundly masochistic to purchase this, but in case you see it on sale. I got it for 39pence, and part of why Im writing this review is because I think everyone involved in this game still owes me the satisfaction of ragging on this trash for having the gall to think they could sell it at any price...Im not a fan is basically what Im getting at. Stay well, well away."

The actual game is a new version of the pipes game from windows 98 with a bit of RNG to waste your time.  If you want a game that will actually make you question if you are more annoyed or bored then this game is for you.

,Recommended,292380,30272318,Posted: 1 March,all,๖ Ollie Huℂℂi,"This is not a great game. I’m not going to pretend it is. Anyone who reads my reviews and sees my game library knows that I’m an optimist and that I like to support dev’s with their kooky ideas.  But it’s unique, they decided to mix two of the randomest genres and see how it works and now we know the answer: not very well… To be very honest I’m rather surprised it sold as well as it did (I mean look at how many reviews it has!)Nevertheless, I am still going to give this a positive review. Why? Because despite the fact that the game is rather mad, it is playable and you can see the effort behind it. I had a rather good go at it and you can see the love the dev’s had for it, no matter what a poor idea it was!Maybe not a great game for adults (who are now the main customer base for dev’s) but perhaps it’s simplicity and repetitive nature may suit a child better."

Heck lets try this anyways and it was actually not that bad. If your into the whole puzzle games idea. Then this game is for you. I quite enjoyed my time playing this whenever im bored or my internet is down (since its single player) it was also on sale so.. Im giving this game a thumbs up."

,Recommended,292380,17888699,"Posted: 4 September, 2015",all,FrPaulDure,It's fun except when your car is creeping along and the next tile starts flashing because it's about to change.  You just have to hope the car enters that tile before it changes or when it does change it'll continue to connect to your path.  Or it might not and you'll have a flash moment to rotate it into the correct position as your car crashes into it.Other than that it's pretty fun if you get it on sale.

No options of any kind, so you have to listen to the terrible music loops, no way to accelerate the car, so you have to wait for ages, it randomly fails levels from what I can tell. My car crashed twice and as far as I saw it was not my fault, a block vanished under me and it was not marked as a block that was about to vanish. This game is embarassing. Not worth the 2 dollars I picked it up for."

It often changes a tile just in front of the car, so you haven't time to avoid the crash. But there is more : as you go farther on the levels, the car goes quicker and quicker, letting not enough time to set the route and if you buy the autodriver option, the game plays by itself..."
