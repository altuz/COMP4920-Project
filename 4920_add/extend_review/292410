First and Foremost, If you're looking for a game thats entirely seamless and has top of the line graphics on the vehicles, You may as well stop this review, and head to another page, as this game is nearly 10 years old now (Came out late 2005).With that aside, SRS has many features that even most current games do not give you the luxury of changing anymore.The Pros:1) Get to Customize your car [i.e. weight reduction (for carbon fiber peices), A Body kit (sadly, only 1 for each car i have tried that is... beside the stock body), Underglow (to which you can change between about 8 different colors), Body+Rim paint, etc.]2) You get to choose which parts can go onto the car, they have about a 18 parts from real life authenticated part manufacturer's that you can use to upgrade your car with, turning that 343HP Nissan GT-R, Into a 918HP AWD Road Beast ;)...3) The game is fairly realistic in its driving (except the fact you can obviously keep driving after hitting someone going 120... but hey, its a video game), But on that note. You dont want to go around and wall grind around corners like alot of people do in NFS. It makes for a very costly repair bill after your races.4) ^ In note with that, It honestly makes you a consious driver, As you NEED to avoid obsticicles if you want to start earning money toward that awesome car you're waiting for, Giving it that realistic feel. (Repair bills are a B!@#$.)5) What it adds over the other games, Is the fact you can free roam everywhere without limitations toward the map. (But the map in its own is fairly small and rugged)6) Races are gauged by a 'Respect' system, You earn respect by running races quickly and cleanly, And throwing in a bit of spice to mix the pot.7) [and probably the best/most reason everyone whose played the game prior for] The girls. Yes, As you race, you get the chance to earn yourself a Girlfriend, (18 in total, all unique, their own descriptions and they even went as far as to add comments as to what they like) Each girl has 3 Videos of them dancing as you race with them tagging along with you. (Except for one, which i heard is bugged with only 1 video, unsure as to which one so far)The Cons:1) The graphics are pretty out-dated (but hey... its 2014, and this is a 2005 game, still not the worst..[could always go back to GTA2?.. bahaha])2) The maps are small.3) There is no real story to the game.4) To those of you whom play RPG games, This Racer has a 'Grinding' feel to it. As you end up repeating alot of races in order to get the car/upgrades that you desire.5) The modifications are pretty limited, (both tuning wise and cosmeticly)6) A (decent, but) Small quantity of vehicles to choose from. [If you are into muscle/luxury cars, and dont like racing with anything else, dont bother with this game, as it deals with mainly tuner styled cars (save for the Lexus IS300)]7) The game goes by fairly quickly, I've got just under 9 hours on record currently, and i already have the 2nd most expensive car, and beaten nearly every race perfectly.8) Is meant as a keyboard game, Not fully integrated for PS3/xbox360 controller use.All in all, I would definately recommend this game for those of you who are nostalgic with old racing games (weather it be this one specifically or racing in general) But would definately just add it to your wishlist untill it comes on sale, unless you're die-hard for those videos ;) haha.**As a side note, For anyone who plays/buys the game, keep in mind that upgrading and buying high-end modifications for your vehicle wont always make it the fastest, weather the fact its a bug in the game [which would not suprise me] Or just the way the designed it.As an example. I've got the Mitsubishi Lancer Evo VIII ('04 model) [which is unlocked before the '02 Evo VII]. Did a few minor modiciations to it, bringing it from the 200HP or so it started at, up to 814HP. It will go 0-60 in 2.5 seconds, But the top speed maxes out at a measly 160mph (claims 162, but i couldnt pull it off, even downhill).While on the other hand, I have a Mazda RX-7, which has about 740HP, but maxes out at a stunning 190mph.If you have any questions, Please drop me a comment, and i'll do my best to help out."

That aside, this game doesnt really do anything very well, whether it be the car physics, the story, or even the customization. The game feels somewhat like an arcade game, the kind you would play at a place like Chuck E Cheese or similar places that had the arcade cabinets with built in steering wheels and race seats to sit in. This was a popular title on ps2, however, so if you are looking to relive memories of playing this i suggest you pick it up at its sale price (99 cents) as it is a really good deal for just a dollar. The .99 price tag is the reason why i give this game a thumbs up, as it is definitely a solid game for street racing fans. However, once it goes back to its normal price (10 dollars) i hate to say it but theres plenty of games that will be a better deal. Pick it up on sale only.*EDIT: runs fine on win10, no issues what so ever.*"

The physics is real enough for me, with REAL DAMAGE on car and you'll need your hard earned money to fix it. But what i like the most about this game it's OPEN WORLD! When i said Open World, it means real open world, with the cop squad chasing you if you speeding right in front of them etc.During the game, there is ""Respect Points"" which is gained by performing great skill(s) like drift and ""two wheelers"" both during free roaming in the city and race. Collects enough points you will unlock new challenges, and get new hot chicks too! lolGraphics is great but don't expect a high end graphics from a game from 2005!Overall, it's not a 100% solid game but it sure worth the money and time.

The game has very arcadey gameplay and driving mechanics, rudimentary customization, and not a whole lot of car selection.  The Nissan Skyline is king, as was par for the course in early 00's street racing games.  For me though, the two big draws were nostalgia and the model videos.  There's no DLC or other user generated content, which honestly bummed me out after finding this game reissued on Steam.

To those who enjoyed Underground 2, this is the closest any Steam game will ever get.Although I enjoyed my playthrough, keep note of these downsides:It's not very realistic - the handling is acrade-style. The fact that you can drop $28k on upgrades and get a 900+ hp Skyline that goes from 0 to 60 in 1.9 seconds doesn't add much realism either.The progression is generally too fast, the game is beat in 5 to 6 hours. 1 hour into it I already had a 450 hp Impreza, which was heavily overpowered compared to other cars. In general, opponent's cars are way too slow in comparison and time trial events give way too much time, making the game very easy.The soundtrack is not big enough and same songs are heard over and over again. The city is also small and easily remmemberable even after 6 hours playtime.Even with those issues, the game is great to play through. Completely worth the 5 dollars I paid on release (50% off)Make sure to get a widescreen fix if you get this game - playing at 4:3 with black bars is not very enjoyable."

It's good because more people will get this mediocre gem once more, bad because, GameSpy servers are, well, very much dead. However, you can still have LAN Parties, or if you cannot be arsed, use Evolve to play with other people, friends mostly.SRS is your usual cheesing street racing racing game, with not much story. You start out driving Ken's Skyline, only to get your cut and start off the game with a new car and race crews. But something people didn't care so much including me, were the girlfriends, they don't add much to the game, and a few of them challenges, can be pretty harsh.But the way of progression is most definitely odd and ineresting. You don't just race for the ANTE or wagers. No points here like championships, but you gotta earn RESPECT points. That's right, if you have no respect, you don't own the streets, and no one will respect ya! You do that by doing, crazy tricks. Near misses, drifts, clean laps, sounds familiar right? Only that you'll be required to get respect points, if you wanna be with the big boys. And that's the kinda unfun part of the game, it gets to a point, you need to get good.The game also features the arcade mode, such as time trials, quick race, and two other main features of the game, for bonus cars, that are not just arcade mode - they...go towards the street mode of the game. Dope, isn't it? Either way...The physics and customization of this game aren't all that impressive, but you can actually flip cars, if you're risky enough. In freee roam, you also have to worry about cops, if they see you commiting illegal actions, and do hefty fines, that might hurt your financial doings at the garage or showroom. The soundtrack is okay and in other moments, cheesy enough to fit in with the game.Overall, if you have friends that are willing to play the game and try the lan mode for multiplayer, the full price while questionable, might be worth it. Or if you're here for the cards and to finish the game, get it dead cheap. Also for nostalgia, any price does it."

Unfortunately the police chases I've had so far have been pretty basic.  Turn a corner and they lose you.The real focus of the game are the races and they feel great.  If you like old-school Need For Speed you will like this.  Unlike Need for Speed, car repair costs money.  Pulling off perfect corner drifts, riding on two wheels or other tricks will replenish a portion of your nitro.  I don't know if car damage is merely superficial or if it effects how your car handles.  I've only played it for an hour so far.In addition to collecting cars you also collect ""girlfriends.""  Once you have won their affections by completing their challenge, you can choose to have them ride with you.  Unfortunately they do not speak to you as you ride.  Maybe she is just sitting there looking at her phone the whole time.  Women.  You can also unlock video clips of the girls dancing or whatever.  Very cheesy.  It doesn't let you stuff dollars in their clothing or anything.  This aspect of the game is unique but only half-cooked.Anyway, I got it on sale for $1 and it was well worth the price.

Its just a fun experience! It doesnt take itself too seriously and thats what made so many of these old games great. They were just ridiculous! Mad bodykits and neon lights everywhere! Truly a time capsule of a game.Car selection is a bit limited, not that much difference between car trims to justify prices in the dealership (just like real life). Options in tuning seem a bit pointless because the variety doesnt really matter. HKS and Greddy turbos have no real difference in performance. Tires do effect how the car handles in different conditions which is a nice plus but its a pain to have to pay for new tires every time you want to switch. Some cars have oddly low top speeds making them fairly useless pretty quick. The girlfriends mechanic is laughable in every regard and really appeals to the lowest common denominator of heterosexual human male. Really not that bad of negatives.

In other words another winner from the ps2 with bad controls and a crap setting.....the sound track is like 4 wierdly censored songs. Oh and if you think there is a good variety of vehicles you are dead wrong. most of the ""other"" cars are merely the same damn car with a different kit.

I want to recreate the anime Initial D, cos this game has a Trueno.3. The girls are hot.My reasons for getting this game might be silly, but its hard for me not to judge it based of merit alone cos i don't play racing games. So heres whats good about it.It takes place at night. Which is awesome. The world is not bad. The racing is decent. The Gf system might be cheesy, but it is nice. Thats ir.What i hate the most about this game are the mechanics that have nothing to do with racing. You cannot quit a race without loosing. If you loose you  cannot restart the match. Most races require an entry fee and you can run out of cash if you have to quit a number of races. No money no real races. Also money is used to fix your car, which gets damaged fast. Damage CANNOT be turned off. The story is also lame for the most part. The music is annoying. Also there is no sense of proper progression which can be argued on whether thats a good thing or not. Also without a test track and just a ton of money, you will end up buyying upgrades you may not have needed. How hard was it really to put a practice track in this game. Seriously, after the first race, you buy your fist car, and upgrade it to start actually playing.So if you are a racing game enthusiast, you might like this. If you are casual, the girls really aren't enough to keep you playing this game, even though they are really attractive.Note - If you are visually impared, you can try this, but cos of the open world nature its really easy to go of the course completey, seeing as how nothing is really walled off. Because it takes place at night it is easier to see the turns, but it really depends on the speed at which your eyes proccess whats going on. Also the motion blur and bloom effects are horrible and distort your vision badly rather than enhance the asthetics. If you are looking for a simple fun racer just go with NFS underground 2. Also the resolution is pretty old school so text is at least easier to read."

If you're wonderingPretty poor car selection too. You've got different variants of the same car but bottom line is, it's still the same car.Controls are pretty crap. Manual transmission is utter rubbish, it doesn't seem to shift when you want it to. It does up fine, but ask it to shift down and it takes it's own sweet time when if finally decides to accept the command. You also can't change controls in the middle of a race or event, you can change it but the game doesn't register the change.Physics is sorta a mix of Juiced and NFS. It can be tricky at times but is generally easy to use and learn.Gameplay experience is largely ruined by the crap sounds. It seems that the game cannot overlay the sounds properly and just chooses one to play together with the BGM.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game unless you absoloutely had to buy a racing game to play with the keyboard."

I didn't play much of the game, because I couldn't torture myself for so long. The game is filled with awfulness.First thing that ruined the gaming mood was the music. Devs couldn't afford to buy a better music I guess. If somebody would listen to any of the SRS's soundtrack in real life would mean they have absolutely zero music taste. In 30 minutes of game play I heard 1 song about 4 times. Does that mean there's only 5 songs in the game?The other thing is one of the maps was in the water channel. What could possible go wrong? Why are the plastic protective barriers there? Does it mean that it was specifically build not for the water but for cars? And who the hell would put a big TV screen there for nobody to see? Maps and the environment were not thought through properly.The developers went further and actually decided not to check for any reference of car crashes. Ugly as hell damage to cars makes you vomit. If it was so bloody ugly why would they even implement it, because I couldn't see if it was even affecting controls.I was looking at the car, and I am kinda fine with the whole squareness of it. But the triangle wheel arch just put me off so much. Unrealistic glass shader. I actually doubt it has one, as I think all the models were just painted.In the world, there's one light that is coming from underneath the surface and casting a shadow of you car on other objects. That's just... Other lights are baked and don't cast any shadows at all. And worst of all – the Sun. Its so huge and bright that it blinds you. As long as your camera is looking at the direction of the sun you are done for. Of course it makes zero difference for AI.I don't know who thinks that the woman in this game are hot. I find the really... old? One of them looks like my mates mother. That is not to mention that in 2004 the fashion wasn't so ugly. They look like they are straight from 90s. And why are they so skinny? Why cant this game follow NFSU2 and get a good looking porn star? I am sure its not that expensive to do one photo shoot.I wouldn't recommend this game to anybody.

It may be a good game, but its not $9.99 good anymore compared to what else may be out there.I may be a little nostalgic for this game, but it is pretty damn solid for what a racer.  Its a little like the poor man's Need For Speed.  It doesn't demand much out of your PC, and the AI does have a little skill behind it, so you find yourself actually having to work for first place late game.The police system is a bit wonky, but is surprisingly competant.  If you get put into a pursuit, it actually requires a lot more than a fast car alone to get away from the cops.  If they remain in pursuit of you for too long, you get busted and lose your ingame cash.  You also get a sort of ""beep"" that goes off faster the closer you are to a cop, and if you're going too fast, you get one warning before they engage in pursuit.  If you're paranoid like me, however, you'll find yourself doing 25 mph anytime you're near a cop.However, this game hasn't aged too well over the years, so the graphics do look a bit dated.  The game's feel also isn't spot on, so you find that 140 feels more like 60.  Frankly, that is a small price to pay.

Worked fine on my Windows 7 PC and with my Xbox 360 controller, though it needs to be selected in the options menu and the pause menu can only be accessed with the keyboard (don't ask me why). Racing is relatively fun, though you can destroy all challenge for the first 3 hours if you slap a turbo and level 3 weight reduction on your first car as soon as you get it with the remaining money, I reccomend you scale your upgrading to the competition!"

The map includes 3 different cities which provide 3 different environments. The handling is not too bad for keyboard but the parts that you add to you car can have an impact on the way your vehicle handles. The graphics dont look that great but thats only because its a 2005 game. The resolution can be changed by using mods online.

76561198046382146,Recommended,292410,23702734,"Posted: 22 June, 2016",all,DiscoJer,"This was one of my favorite original Xbox games, released during the street racing craze (2004 or so). It's a relatively realistic racing game - very forgiving, but you do have to brake for turns - and features mostly a sandbox style play. You get a car, you drive around LA and do several types of races, from organized street races, to pick-up races against roaming cars. In most cases, you bet money, it doesn't come out of nowhere like in a lot of games, except the prizes at sanctioned races.As a side thing, you can do challenges to pick up girls. It's a bit silly, but it provides an extra interesting touch. You can pick one to ride with you and they will be the starter for street races.The car modding is also fairly realistic, but somewhat limited. It's not Gran Turismo with 100s of options, basically a few for each part of the engine.  And the car selection is also relatively limited to imports (mostly Japan, but also VW for some reason)To a certain extent, you make your own challenge, it's very easy to soup up your first car and completley annihilate 90% of the competition.As an older game, it has some technical quirks. It doesn't run at a high resolution (though there are hacked exes that will do this, the rear view mirror ends up being in the wrong place). It's somewhat finicky, it takes about 2 minutes for it to start after hitting run...just nothing, then eventually it pops up. The interface was designed for a controller, so is a bit quirky. Probably not worth $10, but it goes on sale frequently for 99 cents and is easily worth that."
,Recommended,292410,23698626,"Posted: 21 June, 2016",all,daletfours,"It's er...it's ok I guess but it kinda sucks not really-ish?PROS+The upgrades are really cool.Rather than being laid out as ""ENGINE UPGRADE 2 IS AVAILIBLE AND IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE THAN ENGINE UPGRADE 1 SO IT'S OBJECTIVELY BETTER"" you're presented with real, individual parts from real companies, and they all affect how your car runs. One company's suspension might be more expensive, but is the extra $500 actually worth it? The game makes you feel like you're actually buying real parts for a real car, rather than mindlessly clicking [UPGRADE HANDLING] or whatever. It's nice.+You have to spend money on damage repairs and tanks of nitrous.At first I thought I would hate this game mechanic, but I actually like it. You end up driving your car like you actually care for it, rather than ramming other drivers and pinballing off walls. Nitro isn't just there for you to go faster whenever you want, it's a valuable resource to get you out of bad situations when you need it most. This, combined with the upgrade system, makes you treat your car as though you really own it. It's super fukken kewl.+The car list is a ricer's dream.This is one of the only street racing games I've seen that offers different versions of the same car. Other games offer you a Mitsubishi Eclipse, and that's that...but this game lets you choose the base Eclipse, the RS, the GT, etc. Again, combine this with the previous points; you really feel like you own your car. It's truly a special thing.CONS-The handling is♥♥♥♥♥oh my sweet lord.""Do you like games where your car has weight to it and doesn't act like somebody's origami art blowing around in the wind? Well FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK YOU!""-Namco 2004Go find your nearest Hotwheels toy car. Make engine sounds with your mouth and pretend to make 90-degree turns at 100mph. That's exactly what this game feels like.-The sense of speed is also♥♥♥♥♥ oh my sweet merciful lord.One of the things that an arcade racer should excel at is a blistering sense of speed. 150mph in this game feels like 60mph in any other arcade racer. Captain Falcon is laughing at you.-The customization is really sad.If you're mainly into just tinkering under the hood, you can have fun with this game. If you like tricking your car out, move on. The customization options are abysmal. A handful of washed out colors, very few body parts, and sparse vinyls. You can make your car look kinda cool, but it's not going to be unique at all.-Various other little things.The menu music just switches back and forth between two songs: one song where a young gentleman repeatedly ckecks to see if his microphone is working and then proceeds to have a conversation with himself about slowing down, and another song where some other fine young man asks you to contemplate the psychological horrors that accompany one getting their♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥/i] incarcerated.I'm totally serious. What the hell.The world seems like a total ghost town, the sound design is super weak, the sun in the water canal area is like a constant flashbang, and the game just has an overall cheap vibe to it.tl;dr Parts of it are really interesting and unique while other parts suck gorilla balls. The default price of $9.99 is too much in my opinion, but when it goes on sale it's super cheap ($0.99). If you're really open to trying something different and you want a street racer that's not Need For Speed, give this game a try. But be prepared to take the good with the bad."

,Recommended,292410,32025878,Posted: 28 May,all,SlazerKing,"I'm reviewing this game as someone who has never owned a PS2 therefore never played this game. This game is not bad. It bring the retro arcade feel. It also has a more realistic touch towards cars and what not. The only downside -at least to me, that is- to this game is the intense hypersexuality, as that is something I didn't expect in a racing game. Still, this game is a good game, I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy memories, or anyone who like arcade racing in general."

Worth a dollar when it goes on sale.Pros:Fun handling (drifting)lots a girls with funny lines and videosRepair system for your car (you actually have to pay to repair your car) which is awesomeDay and night parts of the mapPolice that drive around and can chase youController supportCons:Annoying point system (if another racer crashes into you, you lose the points, frustratingBad graphics, comparing to Underground 2 where the graphics are beautiful for even todayAnnoying handling at times where you'd like to drift but instead it goes straight into the wall or oversteers heavily without a way to get out of itNot a good soundtrack, I played three races in a series and the same song came up, the darn lunatic song.  The songs are so bad, there's a few good songs but the mainly only play when you are in the lobby to start the race and stuff like that...Also no ability to skip songsYou can't look back when you are in hood mode, there's a rear view mirror but you can't see anything with itPoor car selection, about 10 cars, they just have multiple models and with a dfferent engine and stuff like thatOkay car engine sounds, some, like the Skyline are SO bad, it's sounds so odd and annoyingWIll update this review a bit once I play more."

76561198408671944,Recommended,292410,34970794,Posted: 15 September,all,DevlinBlack666,"Street Racing Syndicate is crass, sexist, testosterone fuelled filth. And it doesn’t apologize.  It’s like The Fast and the Furious on ecstasy.  Or it could be called a Need For Speed Underground clone. This is a 2005 release.  I didn’t expect any miracles folks.Sure it can’t even run on full screen, and sure some of the controls are a bit of a nightmare, though for 99 cents, I’m not complaining.  If anything it’s a Sunday drive when compared to the speed and tension of games like Redout and Thumper.It’s aged horribly. It shows us how far we have come as a culture and how far the racing game genre has evolved. This thing is a dinosaur.  I picked it up for 99 cents. I got my money’s worth.  It’s probably the slowest racing game in existence but it’s still fun.The customization options, the wagering system, the races, the sheer volume of cars… I mean sure it’s no Midnight Club DUB edition, but it’s got real personality for the price and the value proposition was spot on.  Hot chicks, fast cars and free roam. What’s not to love?I used to adore burnout revenge and I used to adore Need for Speed Most Wanted. Then something weird happened and both series seemed to merge into a single lane.  Need For Speed Hot Pursuit was the outcome. A compromise that satisfied nobody.SRS is cheap, dirty nasty fun and it knows it. The keyboard/controller configurations are a little off, the game doesn’t display in full screen, and the graphics are noticeably old. I wouldn’t say its aged well but it doesn’t look terrible.In spite of being made in the naughties, it really feels like a 90s game.  Seriously who uses live action sequences in video games these days?  The models are sleazy hot, the cars all sound and look very nice.  Buy it for nostalgia. Pull it out on weekends and enjoy it.If you play it in short bursts it’s a perfectly serviceable arcade racer with some interesting mechanics long overdue and deserving of remake with modern assets and modern cars even though you probably wouldn’t get away with something this racy in this day and age.Whoever would’ve thought a racing game could be too racy? My only major complaint is that it seems to always crash upon exiting which I can only put down to poor coding. Or it could be Windows 10. I’m sure I could get it to run in full-screen but for 99 cents I’m not too bothered by it.The shadows can be a bit dark sometimes, the controls can at times be a little unresponsive however thankfully the races are often short so it’s not like you can’t just jump back in and retry the circuit.  Think about a minute per lap, 2-3 laps per race.You place wagers with fellow racers. If you win the wager you get money in addition to your prize pool money, both of which you can use to upgrade your ride with a reasonable variety of licensed parts to keep your garage and your ride competitive for current and future events.It lacks a sense of speed though I can only put that down to its age and the fact that I’ve played so many racers. After you’ve played F-Zero GX and Burnout Revenge there’s very little that feels fast in comparison to those classics even to this day.If you pick it up on sale, then I highly recommend it purely on nostalgia value alone in spite of its numerous small issues it’s a fun title at an insane price.  It’s my Sunday night warm-down for a reason. Because its fun, low intensity and one hell of a ride.As of the writing of this review the title is still on sale for another 4 days.. For 99 cents, hook in. You won't regret it.  If you like arcade racers you reallly can't miss with this one.  It has cult written all over it and deserves a spot in any racing fans' steam library.   At that price (90% OFF!!), you'd be mad not to!"

In order to complete the main crew racing mode you need not only to win every race, but to do a lot of stunts in process, ridiculous.
