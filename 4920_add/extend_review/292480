76561198028325917,Recommended,292480,13051179,"Posted: 22 November, 2014",all,TamaSaga,"It's a fun 3D battle game with lots of energy attacks.Gameplay:That said, I might not play many battle games so I don't know if this is normal, but I find it a bit difficult to break out of an opponent's combo.  I mean, all defensive measures (dodge/shield) seem to fail if you don't guard before the first hit lands and your opponent starts an X-X-X-X punch combo.  It'd be great if you can break free somehow, otherwise it seems stupid absorbing damage for if you don't guard in time.  I wonder if you can interrupt the combo chain if you overdrive.You wouldn't think it, but your companion bots are a lot more important than you would expect.  You need them to execute your best moves, run interference, and boost your stats depending on the formation.  If used well, it can make a difficult opponent easy.  And if ignored, even an easy opponent can become a pain in the butt.Story mode is very easy.  The CPU tends to crumble very easily if you perform an all out attack.  And you don't need to worry about ultimate attacks.  But don't let the ease of your completion fool you.  Wait till you unlock and try out Magical Battle Festa mode.  That's when the gloves come off and the CPU becomes serious.Controls:Let's see, what else.  I play with a Xbox360 gamepad and I've found that the default controls work well enough once I get used to them.  I've heard that keyboard players have a bit of trouble working with the camera, of which careful handling is needed.  More on that later.Sound:It's partially voiced.  During story mode, when the characters are performing the prebattle and postbattle conversations, the conversations are punctuated by bits of Japanese here and there.  It's sort of like emoticons.  It's cute I suppose, but it's also strange when you see multiple lines of text and you only hear like 5 words of Japanese.Camera:Because this game is battle royale capable, you might find the camera a bit awkward.  Unlike Virtua Fighter or other 3D fighting games your character and follow-cam do not automatically follow your opponent.   The reason is because there can be up to 3 other opponents.   You can't just jump the camera back and forth automatically.  It's not a movie, it's a fighting game.  Without the automatic tracking, you're left with manual handling.And when you play you'll soon find that part of your success in battle is keeping that camera focused on the action.  If you're not diligent, you can soon lose track of the battle and find yourself blindsided.That said, my pet peeve is that there is a button that allows you to lock the camera onto an opponent.    The button itself is fine, the problem is that it doesn't force your character to automatically face that opponent when you've locked on, you have to handle the direction your character is facing yourself.  So I have to spend a frame or two to run toward an opponent in order to face him before unleashing a long range attack.  Otherwise, I'll find the attack shooting off in the other direction because my character happens to be looking the other way.Story:The story is really short.  It covers a few days of a yearly tournament where the characters each have their motives.  Most of them have pure motives...some do not.  Saying anymore would probably spoil it.  I kind of like how the story mode is arranged.  Basically, the match results are predetermined.  Because of this, the matches that you find yourself playing will be as the character that is supposed to win.  So it's best not to lose, okay?Multiplayer:Right now MP rooms are hard to find.  I guess everyone with the game is trying to unlock all of the characters first.  That said, it was a joy to discover that it's not local multiplayer but internet multiplayer.So let me share my observations.  I'm in the US and I found an opponent playing in Japan.  It's a situation where two players are playing each other from across the world, a 12 hour difference seperating them.  We found that when we were the host, there were no response issues.  However, the situation is different for those players who weren't the host.  They would experience latency issues.  When he hosted, I've found that it could take a second for a button press to register.  While this delay won't mess with your ability to execute a combo since that's just button mashing, it will interfere with your camera control, movement, and timing-related actions like perfect blocks.  I need to test against someone closer to see if the delay is smaller.Overall:A few minor annoyances here and there, but overall the game is rather fun to play."
,Not Recommended,292480,13824163,"Posted: 3 January, 2015",all,Lakitu,"This may look like a fast paced game but it's really shallow and repetitive. Most of the game can be beaten by using the basic attack sequence that always launch your enemy>jump>air attack sequence>ranged attack, and out of that there isn't anything more complex that you can pull in this game, I didn't find any way to break out of the basic combo(and neither did the CPU on me), you can't link different attacks and there isn't any button combinations other than attack while dashing and hold button to charge. The robots that swarm you doesn't seem to add much to the game other than pollute your screen.Certain story levels keep on crashing and there isn't much people playing to get to fight online. Finding a proper control scheme can be troublesome if you don't have a controller as you can't bind any action to your mouse. The lock on is pretty wonky as there is no way to use it while having your character being in the center, it either aligns to the left or to the right and makes your character get too close to the camera, it doesn't even adjust your attacks to the enemy, defeating any purpose of having a lock on system. The game has some nice designs but the 3D models fail to reproduce the quality of the illustrations.I haven't played Magical Battle Arena in a while but I'm sure it was more polished than Festa. At least I don't remember doing the most basic thing such as facing your enemy when attacking being such a chore as it is here.I don't find myself playing this game ever again and I don't recommend getting it even at a lower price.Playism couldn't even get the name of a character right on the achievements."

Takes place in a sci-fi/magical setting with classes like ""Bushido Mage,"" ""Holy Mage,"" ""Magical Cyborg"" and mechanics that actually have depth (more than can be said for the random and quickly-boring ""fly, punch and shoot-only system"" so frequent with this sub-genre of fighter.) With mechanics like Just Guard, invulnerable wake-ups, what I'd call a refined Bushido Blade Clash System, it's very unique formation system and ""Drives"" with their own underlying mechanics and a defensive gameplay that focuses on your ability to sway and punish as oppose to wasting magic/energy/ki/etc, this game feels like what the DBZ Raging Blast games SHOULD have been like... on PC with controller support.

I tend to say yes, but this game has some flaws that have to be adressed.1) The multiplayer is deader than dead. For an arcade title, it's one of the essential features and it's a shame that it's not used. I wasn't able to find an active community prior to launching this game.2) Since Multiplayer is dead, local play is the only option. Story mode lasts for about 3 hours. Besides that, there is a ""Free Battle"" and Tutorial Mode. That's it.3) The optimization is♥♥♥♥♥ For♥♥♥♥♥♥and giggles, I launched a 4player CPU battle. The result was a 4player split screen with horrible FPS drops - which shouldn't happen during a game with ps-vita graphics. Can't blame it on my rig either. I'm sure a i7-3770k, GTX970 and 16gb of RAM should handle it just fine.I recommend picking it up on sale when it is cheap. Very cheap. I can't justify the +10$ I spent  on this purchase. Everything can be reconsidered, when there is an active community, hosting active events. But at the moment, you pay a rather big amount of money for a digital, poorly optimized multiplayer game without an active multiplayer scene."

It's a buggy mess from top to bottom.  No matter what sort of lock on option you choose, you can always rely on the camera facing the opposite direction of the enemy.  The sound and music will randomly crash.  Hit boxes are a mess.  There were several times I was juggled by enemy combos when the enemy was several feet away from my character and facing the other way.  That doesn't matter though, thanks to the braindead AI everyone can be easily defeated with some button mashing.  You could go looking in the empty lobbies for a human opponent, or you could just buy a better game to play online.There are lots of Japanese games on Steam that have cute girls in them that aren't pure trash.  Treat yourself to one of those instead."

The story is silly and anime as hell.  My only gripes are the default controls are kinda bad and the keyboard controls are unplayable(thankfully I own a game pad) No mouse support though. If you have a game pad and 4 friends to play with I recommend itEDIT: a point brought up by Soluna is being added. I should note this game is niche so it does not have a big user base at the moment(though a summer sale could change it) If you want it mainly for online play you may wanna hold off or think about it. If you got some friends(4 or so) interested in the game I'd say buy it. Also good if you are into these kinda DBZ sorty arena fighting games."

While it looks fun, the controls are needlessly complicated and basically require a controller to play comfortably. I recommend games like this! Some of them are quite easy to play without a controller.Unless you have a good PC controller, don't buy this game unless you plan to buy one of those too."

I know that there are mixed reviews about this game, but I must admit that this game is really good. Considerably fun to play. The graphics are also good. Full-force combat is pretty intense while making an attempt to pull out a combinative move or moves (Chaining). And yes, getting combo'd by specters is pretty irritating in such an overwhelming type of manner, but after all, I must say that this game is pretty fun and enjoyable to play for those who are most likely interested. :]"
