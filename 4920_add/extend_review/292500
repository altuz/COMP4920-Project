,Recommended,292500,32603015,Posted: 20 June,all,Hecatonchires,"Kero Blaster is a fun but in the end quite challenging sidescrolling shooter in the style of earlier Contra games from the creator of Cave Story. The game is very linear with some small bonuses tucked in hidden places here and there to reward exploration, but the main focus is in shooting enemies and collecting money and powerups. There's also some precision platforming in places but not much, which is just as well since the movement controls are a bit stiff.The game starts pretty simple with easy terrain and straightforward bosses, but the difficulty ramps up in the later levels and the Zangyou, or Overtime mode may provide a decent challenge for even an experienced player. The Zangyou mode unlocks after beating the game and rather than being just a harder version of the game, it actually moves the plot forward and changes the levels and even some bosses in various ways and the last levels and bosses are completely new. After that, there's even another mode available for unlocking and it has some fun secrets to be found! All in all, the various modes should give at least over 10 hours of playing time, possibly even more if you want to try and unlock all the achievements.One thing worth noting is how the game saves your progress. The game autosaves at almost every screen transition and you never lose anything like weapon upgrades or money by dying. Even minibosses and some forms of end bosses stay dead if you game over, so as long as you keep trying, you'll eventually amass so much money you can max out all upgrades and make the game considerably easier.Kero Blaster is definitely worth your time if you're interested in retro-style sidescrolling shooters. The only real negative I can think of are the somewhat stiff controls. The game also has a separate demo in form of two small freeware games, Pink Hour and Pink Heaven. They tell a separate, small story involving some side characters, are about 15 minutes long each and have hard mode and multiple endings. The gameplay is much simpler in them, but they give a pretty accurate approximation of how Kero Blaster starts out."

Kero Blaster is, however, more straightforward and linear than Cave Story. I love how you upgrade your weapons, the story is really funny, the soundtrack is brilliant. Although somewhat short, I know I am going to play this through again and again just because it is so much fun to play."
,Recommended,292500,19024698,"Posted: 11 November, 2015",all,Sean A_yylmao,"Fun run and gun style platformer from the developer of the highly praised Cave Story. Outside of a few very questionable bosses, the game remains consistently fun. The stages are expertly designed in both layout and enemy placement in order to give a lot of diversity of feel to a game without a huge amount of mechanical depth as well as encouraging the player to use all of the different weapons the game has to offer. It is very difficult to get through the game exclusively using one weapon.The base game is pretty short (around 2-3 hours) however there is a fair bit of bonus content. In particular, ZANGYOU mode is a hard mode which ramps the difficulty up quite a bit and adds some new content and dialogue in as well.Overall this game is a masterfully crafted experience that is simple to play but has enough diversity to never wear itself out. Fun gameplay, a cute aesthetic, and amazing music make this game highly recommended from me, even at the full price. Further, there are two free pseudo-demos called ""Pink Hour"" and ""Pink Heaven"" which contain similar gameplay though shorter and easier. If you are unsure about purchasing this I would recommend giving them a shot first."
,Recommended,292500,26635167,"Posted: 16 November, 2016",all,roa-kun,"Kero Blaster is a side-scrolling action game, which constantly tries to fool you that it's shorter than it really is. At first it wants you to believe that there is only 4 levels in the game, then bam, it's actually 7, and then you find out that there is actually 7 more levels waiting for you in Overtime (or Zangyou) mode. If that's not enough, after beating Overtime mode you will also unlock New Game+, called Bonus (or Omake) mode.The story of the game is pretty simple - you're a field technician who maintains teleporation devices throughout the world. Unfortunately, these teleportation devices are subject to some interdimensional parasites, which disrupt their work. So you have to reach a disrupted teleporter on foot, going from the nearest working teleporter, always through a very hazardous environment. It all starts simple, but things start to go downhill after your boss decides that having an interdimensional parasite as a pet is a good idea. Yeah, what could possibly go wrong? That's the plot for the first part of the game, the second part has its own plot, which is focused less on saving the day and more on the characters themselves, but I don't want to spoil it here for you.So there are 14 levels in total, along with a New Game+. It needs to be said that levels share names and visual themes (except for the last one) between Normal Mode and Overtime Mode, but the level design itself differs more and more with each next level. Normal mode and Overtime mode also have different plots and different cutscenes between levels.Level design is a really strong feature of this game. The levels are difficult, and require good platforming and shooting skills, along with quick decision-making, but you'll really appreciate cool moments of the level that you've experienced - the developer sure knows how to put your skills to the test. The good part is that, however unfair situation may seem, there is usally a key to resolve it easilly. As far as the difficulty curve goes - it's not that spiky, with Normal mode being a preparation for the real challenge in Overtime mode.The gameplay goes as follows: you go through the level, divided by several stages. Each level has two bosses - a mid-stage boss and a real boss. Somewhere in the level you'll find a shop where you can upgrade your weapons, replenish / upgrade your lifebar, purchase extra HP tanks or buy a ridiculously priced 1-up (which is there mainly for players aiming to beat the game with no gameovers). To buy all of the above, you need money, so how do you get money? There are two ways. First way is a regular one - kill enemies, and they will drop coins (with rare variation of dropping health replenishment or even a one-up). Second way - explore the level and find secret spots and hidden passages, which will lead you to treasure chests / money safes with a substantial amount of cash.Starting the level, you usually have three lives. Lose them all, and you'll have to start the level all over again, there are no save points to load from, like in Cave Story or even a checkpoint after mid-boss, you always start from square 1, which can get really annoying. The sour relief is that you won't have to beat the mid-boss again if you've beaten it already and you keep all your upgrades with you. The game also allows you to accumulate lives between levels, so you can save some up for hadrer parts if you're playing well on easier parts.As far as visuals go, Kero blaster goes for a simpler style of early NES titles, like Metroid or Layla. This simplified style with vibrant colors and amount of visuals impossible for original era is actually very appealing to the eye. Additionally, it helps you to identify enemies and projectiles really fast, which is quite important. Also, as the game involves lots of coin-collecting, its developer made sure that coins look really nice and shiny, making you want to grab them, which is a nice touch.Music gets you in the mood for the game, which exactly what is should do, but isn't something you would listen outside of the game.For a platforming action game this solid, Kero Blaster has sold really poor, with SteamSpy estimating it around 13k at the time of reivew. If you want to play a hard, but elaborate and well-designed platformer, definetly give Kero Blaster a try.P.S. For more awesome hidden gems, follow the steamCRIMINALLY Low Salescurator."

It's a step backward in complexity since it's very linear, but it has just as much charm to it, maybe even more. Everything is cute and unexplained, which really make it feel like an old-school game.The controls are very tight and feel great. The weapon upgrades are simple but very rewarding. Every level is well thought out and offers a decent challenge, especially in zangyou mode.Just friggin buy it and play it already, it's amazing"

Sadly, the game is pretty short, even with Zangyou and Omake modes, I promise you'll never want this game to end.Talking about characters and story, characters are pretty easy to relate to, more than Cave Story. The story is very simple, just read the description of the game and you'll get an idea.Graphics are ok, how the character is drawn is pretty simple compared to other graphics, this annoys me a bit but it's because the graphics on the game in fact were going to be alot more simplier (check Daisuke Amaya's YT account, he has a very early trailer of the game, it even has cat waifu savings)The soundtrack is pretty much like Cave Story's, but the engine it uses is different, however, some songs are just pretty good, the soundtrack may be even better than Cave Story's."
,Recommended,292500,19039934,"Posted: 12 November, 2015",all,(YouTube)Dragnix,"Summary:Solid but not spectacular is the name of the game with Kero Blaster. You can tell that the guy who created Cave Story is behind it with the art style in question, but it never hits the same level of charm or story that that game did. It's originally an IOS game that feels more at home here, with simple controls but solid gameplay that relies on good level design and basic weaponry to propel it forward. What it doesn't have is anything that hits you in the mouth, aka the knockout punch to really sell the game, as it's solid in most aspects, but not great in any one either. Some elements have problems with boss fights that let down and an overall sense of having played the game before, but for a title to pick up on sale, it will bring back some memories of Cave Story while you play through it, and it is enjoyable. Just don't expect Cave Story 2.Gameplay Footage and Video Review:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0zlBJWN3XwLists:+:Strong level design adds to the game's variety over time and helps the simple mechanics succeed thanks to enemy placement and rearranging of hazards.Simple straight forward gameplay that feels polished, and doesn't go overboard in any one way. Feels like most pieces fit together with no issues.Difficulty curve is solid as there's a solid progression of it throughout the game, never having large gaps or peaks of difficulty, but a solid rise of it.Controls feel at home here as opposed to the iOS.Gun variety is simple but rewards smart use of each gun type and different gameplay styles.You'll get some nostalgia for those who played Cave Story by the feel of the game.Jumping takes a bit to get used to for some of the more tricky jumps, but it does settle down once you get an understanding of what the game is going for.-:Some boss fights miss badly being basically regular enemies with nothing really new to show for it.Audio options missing, and screen resolution options are really non existant. Even for a mobile port, it doesn't really do a good job of playing to the Steam strengths.Some jumps go for the extreme limit of jump height, leading no room for error, and frustration sets in.Those Expecting Cave Story 2 in terms of charm and story will need to look away, as it never hits that level."

Why didn't more people play it?This game feels right at home with his earlier works. With similar physics, switcahble weapons, the same chipset for music, and an♥♥♥♥♥load of bosses and suprising content thrown at you when you don't expect it.Bonus: one of the most satisfying hard modes I've ever seen. Hard mode is almost an entirely different game complete with unique enemies, drastic changes in the environment, and a plethora of additional bosses.If you're old enough to hold Cave Story with any sort of high regard, you owe it to yourself to play Kero Blaster."

You can easily just stick to one weapon for all bosses, though.Character designs are solid for the main cast. Monster design is... fine I guess.Music is outstanding. Very catchy and upbeat. Easily the highlight of the game.NEUTRALBosses range from ok to downright frustrating. Mostly ok but I'll highlight a few below.BADKero's weight as you jump around is... frustrating. It's extremely floaty and you are COMMITTED when you launch into the air. I honestly hate jumping around as this frog, which is bad considering you will need to do a lot of dodging in this game.The hitbox for Kero feels off. I could never put my finger on it. I got hit by so many objects I never thought I was close to.Of all bosses I never enjoyed fighting the vehicle and the final boss. The vehicle boss is just annoying as you try to thread the needle where Kero's hitbox is so you don't get hit by missiles and hopefully don't get crushed into a wall.SUMMARYWIth good music, a moderately ok combat system, and some frustrating aspects for Kero (e.g. jumps, hitbox) I can kind of recommend this merely on the good graces of Cave Story. Kero Blaster isn't bad, but it never quite feels good."
,Recommended,292500,19070182,"Posted: 14 November, 2015",all,J-Mac,"I really like this game, but this is not Cave Story. Cave Story was more explorative and had secrets hidden in little nooks and crannies like Super Metroid. Kero Blaster has a very linear progression, akin to something like Mega Man. This linear progression is a big strength, because enemy placement is supurb. I'm not going to go into any story aspects of this game, because I don't want to spoil much, also its not a game with a heavy story. I really enjoyed the stage design, like I said great enemy placement. The pallet choices were good, the pixely aesthetics takes me back to the old days. It's also got a great soundtrack, I mean can you really expect less of the guy who made other games like Cave Story and Ikachan. Studio Pixel did a great job with this release, I know it has been out for some time, but its nice to see it released on steam.The only real downside is that you'll have to grind money off of enemies or die a lot in later stages to get your weapons and life meter maxed out, but grinding doesn't seem like that much of chore because this game can get hard. Especially if you're playing Zangyou Mode which is Kero Blasters new game+/ hard mode. I say pick it up, Its wonderful."

This is one of those well made games that don't revolutionize anything but just works. It's an action platformer, with lots of variety of environments and enemies. It has a finite number of lives system, that sends you back to the beginning of the level when you run out of it and to the beginning of the screen when you lose one life.The game self regulates the difficulty with its upgrade system. Each time you die you keep all your money, so eventually you'll beat whatever part you're stuck by simply having more fire power. Bosses don't have to be beaten ever again! which is nice considering they are not only difficult but quite long. In my previous review I didn't notice that and almost gave up on the game because I didn't want to fight a specific boss again.I liked it.

It slowly becomes harder as you go along without ever making it hardcore die hard f*ck your life BUT the game has a standard mode, completely separate NG+ AND an extra hard mode for those that do like to hurt themselves. That is 3 game modes right there already. Then Kero Blaster features a handful of achievements for those that love to fight for that extra feeling of satisfaction by doing things ridiculously overkill and making things so much harder than need be making sure you get your money's worth of playtime.The game features a bunch of awesome weapons including lasers, flamethrowers and bubbles. Yes, bubbles, you will learn to love them, go away DC! There are upgrades for each weapon, life powerups, secrets to find and more making sure that apart from general game progress, you are shooting for a reason while slowly making survival a bit easier.It has a great little story on top of that, not much text, not much explanation, no life changing deep impact psychological meaning of life kinda stuff or anything like that, it's simple, cute and doesn't take you for a retard. It is just there because it's there and isn't being forced on you to make you feel like you experienced Shakespeare.The final thing I need to say is that the soundtrack is excellent, the music is catchy, mysterious, beautiful and thrilling, all the right tunes on all the right moments and gameplay aside, one of my favourite aspects of the game and you'll be humming most of these themes in your head for at least months to come. The pixel graphics are simple but do not try to emulate some 8 bit or 16 bit style like most pixel based games out there, Kero Blaster is creating its own world and the busy screen and back ground layering really try to set its own standards and the game plays by its own rules.So to sum up, you have great bossfights to engage with insane weapons and high speed gameplay as you experience a unique little story all the while riding the tunes of doom.

I'd say, if you like the demo of this game, you'll probably like this game. In short, you have 4 different weapons which you can upgrade. each weapon is unique and upgrading a weapon really makes a diffirence. Ontop of that, every weapon is usefull.The game can be pretty hard sometimes but it's nothing unfair. If you die, it's probably your fault for being too careless.The bosses in this are designed incredibly well, testing your skill in using your weapons and platforming capabilities.The base game is pretty short but after you've finished the game there's even a hard mode. And I don't mean like a ""enemies do more damage and such"" but a REAL hardmode. the levels get redesigned to make them even harder, bosses are made harder by redesigning the stages or the bosses themselfs and there is even a whole new level and 3 new bosses. Hardmode is a true test of your skill and no moment feels unfair.The base game may be short, but in my opinion, hardmode really makes the game. I'd say this game is worth every penny"

,Recommended,292500,21420145,"Posted: 23 February, 2016",all,Times,"Kero Blaster is a bit of an odd duck. It's the second major release from lone auteur game designer Pixel, who about a decade ago created the absolutely legendary Cave Story. Pixel has made a few small games here and there since then, but this is his second major retail release.Let me say first that if you liked Cave Story, you'll like Kero Blaster, and that's really because it's just more of the same. A few of the mechanics are changed up here and there and there's a much heavier emphasis on arcadey action than plot and characters, but when you get down to the shooty pew pew bits it plays exactly like Cave Story did.Something that fans of Cave Story may not like, however, is that Kero Blaster is short, and comparitively easy. Veterans of Pixel's works will have no trouble breasing through the campaign. If, however, you are new to Pixel's games, then Kero Blaster would be an excellent start.From a personal view, I enjoyed the game a lot, but I did find it lacking in some regards. The ""prologue"" game Pink Hour gave the impression that Kero Blaster would, like Cave Story, be a story driven exploration game rather than a linear arcade shooter, and I get the distinct impression that was the original intention. Environments are detailed and interesting, and buyable upgrades are priced in such a way as to suggest a longer game. I feel like Kero Blaster is a game that the devoloper got bored of and just wanted to get out the door so he could move on to something new. This is supported by most of the music, sound effects, and even some of the assets and sprites being recycled from Cave Story, which is odd when Pixel is well known for his MIDI music and pixel art, AND because there were new sprites and music in PInk Hour.Here's the break down:Pros- Fun, high action shooter with extremely tight controls.- Four interesting weapons to choose from, each one feeling unique and special.- What new sprites there are are cute and endearing.Cons- Short, perhaps three hours if you have a lot of trouble, and two if you don't.- There's very little story. What's there is cute and funny, but it feels rushed.- The entire game has an aire of partialness, like this is only part of a game. A really good part to be sure, but incomplete.In closing, I recommend Kero Blaster because it's a fun little diversion, but since it's so short and lacking in plot, it'd be best if you picked it up on sale. The base price is a little much for what you get, but it's still a great game."

To start off, if you're looking for a veritable Cave Story 2, this isn't it. Kero blaster is less Metroidvania and more Arcade side scroller.In the game you play as a Frog who is part of the Custodial Sciences division of a company and has to kill strange alien creatures. To do so, you have a variety of upgradable weapons to fight with. Health is dealt with in what I would call a mix of Zelda and Mario style. You have a certain number of hearts and when you run out you lose one of the three lives you started with.I really enjoyed the game so far. The bosses are interesting, the enemies are unexpectedly challenging, and the upgrades are deffinitely worth the gold you spend on them. In addition you have a seemingly simple plot running in the background about the Frog's boss.Overall if you're looking for a solid Arcade platformer, Kero Blaster is the way to go. It's simple, the controls are tight, and you play as a frog. What more could you ask for?"

Rather than compare Kero Blaster to its creator's previous game, I think it would be better to say that this game is on its own a fun experience.  Music, aesthetic, and story are all pleasant.  Each gun felt useful in its own way and platforming controls worked well.  Levels are straightforward and linear so there's not much in the way of exploration nor choices to be made, but thats how the game is.Its about 3 hours long or less on a single playthough, with extra challenge in a hard mode that I did not try.  I believe this extra mode adds to the story somewhat as it plays like a sequel where you revisit the levels again, but again I can't say as I didn't play through it.

76561197998163088,Recommended,292500,19225970,"Posted: 22 November, 2015",all,Jjj'jj,"Quick Disclaimer; despite what the Store Page says it is Vista supported.Kero Blaster is simple, straight-forward run and gun style platformer in a similar vein to Pixel most internationally famous work, Cave Story. Unlike Cave Story, the game has almost no ""Metroidvania"" elements in it's design. Instead weapons and upgrades are unlocked naturally as you progress through the seven levels. There's no back travel function, so when you beat level 1 you can't go back to it short of starting a new game.As far as difficulty is concerned, it is easier than Cave Story. An auto save function allows you, for the most part, to effectively retry rooms with no major downside except towards the finale when the checkpoints start breaking up by several screens rather than one. As long as you don't die (and the menu button can be brought up at any point so even if you miss a jump and plummet into a pit as long as you're quick enough you can still retry no consquence.) you can keep retrying infinitely if needed. That said, Hard mode, or ""Zangyou"" mode is a definite challenge with it's own storyline. It revamps existing content IE new stage layouts, enemies and even boss patterns are slightly or completely different. Long time Pixel fans, or even just players who enjoy a good challenge will greatly enjoy this mode, as normal mode is decidedly lacking in serious difficulty until the last sections of the game.Gameplay is fun and basically a more straight-forward version of Cave story system with some key differences. Instead of weapon exp, money drops, which can be used to upgrade weapons or buy defensive items like more health or revive jar. Weapons no longer downgrade if hurt enough, and stay consistent. Like Cave Story, each weapon has at least 3 stages. Each one progressively better than the last. Some weapons even have a fourth stage. There's a total of 5 weapons in the game, one of which is a secret. They're all very useful and surprisingly well balanced. If you're the type to stick with one weapon, you'll probably have trouble in certain parts, but for the most part every weapon works exceedingly well in all situations the game presents. In order to max all the weapons though, expect to do a bit of grinding. If you ignore defensive upgrades you should have to do relatively little though, something else rewarding good play.Music and level design are pretty much what I expect from Pixel. Nothing really stands out as much as some of his other soundtracks, but I still absolutely enjoy Kero Blaster OST. Levels too, probably aren't his best work but his stage design is very ""fair"". Most area gimmicks or traps are explained in safe areas to give you a heads up and nothing really is ""trial and error"" about Kero Blaster. It's difficulty is extremely honest and if you die it's usually on you, not because of a cheap death. The story is kind of non-existant, very simple story. It's very cute in a way, particularly with it's foreshadowing.All in all, it's a nice little sidegrade to his other work, Cave Story. It does some things better and some things worse. If you're a mega pixel fan you'll be happy to know it definitely delivers. If you're a casual fan you'll find this probably MORE enjoyable. Even if you've never played a run and gun platformer before, this game is probably one of the best examples of a place to start. Either way, I hope you have as much fun as I did."

I occasionally found myself going through levels multiple times because I ran out of lives against bosses, but nothing felt particularly unfair, and each new trip through a level rewarded me with enough money to upgrade a weapon or my maximum health.The levels provide a variety of challenges, from fast paced reaction-based combat with a large group of fast enemies to slow, precision-based platforming. The game organically paces itself by switching up the style of challenge and the speed of gameplay.It has a wonderful hard mode which is really more of an epilogue (or part 2, I guess), with totally new levels sharing similar themes and bosses, and an entirely different final level with five new boss fights.A quality game lasting about 8 hours that I'd recommend to anyone who wants a fun, light-hearted jump-and-shoot style platformer."

76561198280076940,Recommended,292500,23211287,"Posted: 25 May, 2016",all,Mr. Kartoffel,"SUMMARYKero Blaster is short but fun experience created by Pixel of Cave Story fame about a Frog who works at an office of ""custodial sciences"". Your task as a player is to get to the end of the stage and defeat the boss.GAMEPLAYThe gameplay is quite basic, and rightly, so given that the game was inspired by old classics such as Mega Man or Contra. You move Kero with the arrow keys, jump with Z, and fire with X. You can also fire in 3 directions: up, left, and right. Whenever you start firing, your firing locks into whatever direction you started firing in, allowing you to strafe. Kero's movements are a bit slippery and floaty, but you get used to it. Eventually you'll find more weapons that you can switch between with the A and Z keys. You can also buy things from the shop with all the hard-earned cash you collected! Finally, there is a jetpack which offers you further momentum and allows you to reach higher places. Surprisingly, the jetpack feels like it actually has some weight to it, which is impressive for such a simple game. In short, it feels good.PRESENTATIONMost people have something that furthers their interest in a specific game and makes them want to finish it, whether it's the gameplay or the story. In Kero Blaster, the presentation is what kept me going. Simply put, the graphics are stunning and the music is perfect. In more detail, Pixel's art style used in the game creates emotions for the player to experience, as with the music. When you're in the ice level, the color palette is mainly whites and blues, creating this sense of a calm, cool atmosphere and the music complements it, while the stark greys and other industrial type colors give off the impression of danger or fear. The song that plays during the first part of the 6th stage is one of the most suprisingly dark & depressing themes I've heard in a video game. My favorite part would have to be the second part of the 6th stage. The colors mixed in with the scenery make you feel like you're experiencing a part of someone's past that they would like to forget, and the music, while nothing spectacular, is INCREDIBLY effective, making you feel cold and distant. Pixel knows how to strike certain emotions, and It just gets better the more you play. It's incredible, nuff said.DIFFICULTYNow comes my LEAST favorite part of this game. Don't get me wrong, I love a challenge, and Kero Blaster isn't even that hard. But it seems to have taken my least favorite aspect from the 8-bit era into account-cheap encounters. As in, ""HOW IN THE WORLD WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN?!!"". One time an enemy fell from the sky right     as I entered a room. Another time, a bird flew in right as I was about to leave a room and killed me! How is THAT fair? Sometimes while you are focusing on one thing, you don't notice the other thing coming to get you, like a falling ceiling light, for instance. And whenever you game over, you have to start from the VERY beginning! Even on the really long last level! One more nitpick is that Kero is kind of slow, making it hard to dodge stuff when things get crazy. Even though it can be cheap though, it can still provide you with a fair challenge, and those moments are usually a lot of fun.TL;DRI liek the colors and sceenery and the music it's gud and gamplay is gud but the difficulty can be cheap.8/10"

This mode actually has a different story. Same levels, but different designs and the cutscenes are different. The levels while it is the same, the boss battles has shown to be different as well. The last level is also different from the other last level.This game was tough, but if you can pull it through then you'll win for sure.

This game doesn't try to be anything more than it is, a very good game of the genre. The cutcenes between levels bring life and charm to the characters. The weapons you find along the way are varied and upgradeable, each having uses in multiple situations but all being able to do the job. This makes experimenting fun and doesn't punish you if you spec into one weapon over another. The game isn't too long but the replay vaule comes in after you have cleared the game for the first time. Kero's take on a hard mode is something that many other games should take note of. Instead of just playing the same game again with less health, more enemies, etc...this game delivers a completely new story for the second time through along with a whole set of new levels to go through. This second go around is of course much harder than the first, and the bosses remain largely the same but tweaked to increase their difficulty. It is a very fun, charming and challenging title that should not be overlooked becuase of its simple graphics. Studio Pixel has done it again, just this time on a smaller scale title."

You play as a frog who gets yelled at by his boss, but gets to blow stuff up to make up for that.Kero Blaster is an action platformer with an arcadey feel to it. You die in a few hits, and health is a bit scarce, making the game fairly challenging. Coins collected during the campaign can be used to upgrade guns into more powerful and satisfying ones, as well as increase your max health.While the game only took me about two hours to complete, the excellent enemy design and pacing (as well as a hard mode unlocked after finishing the game) provide high replay value.The soundtrack is also fantastic."

The controls are comfortable enough that you can get into a groove with a level and in step in line with enemy actions, but they're limited enough that they force you to think out how you're going to tackle a situation, thanks to very limited control in air, a sense of momentum, and staying stuck in a firing direction as long as you keep your finger on he fire button.

Although it has a lives system where the player must start at the beginning of the stage if the player loses all their lives, the frustration is removed because of the store system: stores are placed in the middle of each stage and you can buy health and weapon upgrades that significantly make the player stronger. Not only that, but since the player has familiarity with the boss, with the new store upgrades, the player will have a much easier time defeating the boss, which, instead of causing a feeling of dread or fear in that the player might have to redo the level all over again, creates a feeling of excitement knowing that the player will kick the boss' ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥after it killed the player.** tl;dr store system removes frustration from lives sytem **"

It doesn't do anything new.The weapons are fun and it's a good surprise when upgrading because you don't really know what kind of new weapon your old one will become. The game is a moderate challenge. You may have to try some areas or bosses maybe up to 10 times, but you know nothing is going to be too hard to beat. You don't even have to struggle.Definitely level up. Some things will seem extremely hard. Just do some farming and level up weapons and raise your health and you will blast enemies away with no problem. It's kind of made that way.Negative: A lot of the bosses sit around for a long time.

(The main fella is so cute~ <3) The only problem I have with this game is the fact you can't shoot down and sometimes but rarely the moving and shooting directions can feel slightly sluggish plus I feel that they should allow you to shoot downwards, that basic move would give so much better flow into the controls. I know that they may or may not add that move later on and that the creators made this so you can't aim down so that you have to use unlockable weapons, but I think it would of made it smoother if they allowed you to shoot downwards(Or add it in the start if they do have it in the game.) It would make it feel much more epic and smooth as a platform shooter. other than that also I Love the game play style, the leveling up system and the retro level design and epic challenging boss battles.

While it shares similarities to Cave Story, it is very different than Cave Story. Kero Blaster is not story driven, but rather game play focused. There is a large focus on this game of aquiring different weapons, upgrading them with money that foes drop, and continuing this process from level to level.  If 2D platformers with guns is something you're interested in than this game was made for you.The graphics are a great throwback to the old 8 bit aesthetics. The pixel based graphics looks big, bright and colorful. You always know where your character is and where the enemies are at all times. This pixel look really works for Kero Blaster, it's charming and endearing. The large but simple character sprites give you just enough information where you know what every character is, but also leave room for your imagination to fill in the gaps.The sound is great. All the sound effects feel really great when you're shooting your weapons. This soundtrack is catchy and light, which suits this game perfectly.The gameplay is really fun, but also challenging. This is a very linear game, you go from one level to the next, shooting your way through enemies. Enemies drop coins which you can use to upgrade your weapons, or buy an extra heart container, or an extra life or even a life replenishing potion. You can find the stores to buy this things about mid-point through each level. While each level has a steady challenge spike, where you will probably die a few times, gathering all the coins so that you can either upgrade a weapon or get an extra hear container make you feel like your accomplishing something even when you die. I think this system works well for a short game like Kero Blaster.The level designs are challenging, but never confusing. There are secret hidden areas for the invested player who likes to look in every nook and cranny. There is even a new game + mode where all of the levels are changed and there is a new story thread that brings you from level to level.Kero Blaster is an excellent 2D platformer shooter game. It's a little short, about 2-3 hours to beat, but there is a new game + mode that extends the replayability. If you grew up playing the NES you'll really like Kero Blaster. If you liked Cave Story, you'll like Kero Blaster is you go in knowing that the story takes a backseat to the game play."

The weapons are uniquely situational and come in 4 different flavors; Original, Sourcream and Onion, Raspberry, and Spicy Jalapeno. ]Your original blaster is an all around weapon, being good for DPS, Range, and crowd control, it's pretty well fleshed out.Sourcream and Onion shotgunny-thing is a little less generic, and more specialized, being for hitting tough-to-reach enemies and doing decend DPS at close range. It's pretty great for hitting enemies your other weapons can't.Then you have a nice Raspberry bubble blaster that shoots... bubbles. As harmless as it might sound, it excels in hitting ground enemies and spamming out tight areas.And finally your Spicy Jalapeno flamethrower is exactly what you think it would be. A high DPS, short range, icicle melting flame beam that ruins nearby enemies and melts incoming projectiles.The enemy and level design work great as well, having incredible high-tension combat sections, as well as slower, more thoughtful platforming segmets. Only the most daring gameplay segments combine the both of them for a trulySTRESSFUL, RAGE INDUCINGLY DIFFICULTinspiring and challenging gameplay high-moment. It's really something to see.The sound design is oddly fitting and extremely good, with satisfying weapon noises, a stellar soundtrack, and fun, lighthearted sound effects. But if you go in, expecting Cave Story level music, you'd be suprised at how (please don't kill me) simmilar they are. Not much has changed, other than how much  funkier this OST is compared to Cave Story's more upbeat and ecstatic OSTTL;DR is gud, pls pley."

As far as I know this game has no relation to Cave Story story wise. But by itself, it is a great game with a humorous story.The story of this game should really be experienced by the user so I will just give you the premise. You work for the C&F teleporter company and there are some teleporters that are malfunctioning. It is up to you to clean up the teleporter and engage any hostiles that stand in your way. Later on you learn that these black furry ball creatures are disrupting the teleporter. That is all I have to say but you will be laughing. Most of the story is told through symbolism (if I said that right). Some things are not explained fully.Gameplay wise it is a 2D sidescrolling shooter. You can shoot left and right and upward but down like in Cave Story. You get four weapons which can be upgraded. Upgrading works by collecting coins sometimes dropped by fallen enemies. If you lose all your lives you have to restart the stage but you keep all your coins and upgrades so eventually you will beat the stage because of your superior gear. One weird part of the game is that it seems like the entire set of weapons do the same amount of damage when fully upgraded but they just fire differently. So for bosses you can take your pick (I guess). I found the green weapon to be useless and stuck with the lazer uzi because it could reach the end of the screen quickly. The bubble gun and the flamethrower were useful too.I have six hours on record but about 1 and 1/4 of those hours were idle so this game (if you suck like me) is about 4-5 hours long. Some could probably beat it in two. There is an extra mode that you unlock upon beating the game so that will add replay value. There are also some achievements where they want you to beat the game without taking a hit pretty much.But you should get this game just because of its absurdity and good gameplay."
