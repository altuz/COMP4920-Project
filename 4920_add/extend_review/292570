,Recommended,292570,10146565,"Posted: 17 May, 2014",all,Tangysphere,"Chompy Chomp Chomp is a very simple game. If you want a myriad of playing options and a wealth of choice, this is not the game for you. The single player arcade mode is weak, but is at least expanded with co-op mode.At it's local multiplayer heart, it's good fun though. It's frantic and a good take on the Bomberman game, while remaining pleasantly simple and looking pretty good. However, it is severely lacking in some areas - there is no online multiplayer which is a big misstep and I would have liked more modes in the game as there's only so much you can do with points and time.I wish there was a mixed feeling option for this game as there is certainly potential and if you play a lot of local multiplayer you will get a lot out of this as it's a blast. On the other hand, there's so much that could have been done to make the game better rather than a lazy single player mode, and if that's the sort of thing you like about games you're not going to have a good time.Based on my preferences, this *just* earns a recommendation but wholly conditional on if you like local multiplayer. I hope the devs do a lot more with this title as the potential is there - they just need to capitalise on that."

,Recommended,292570,14877466,"Posted: 13 March, 2015",all,Negan,A very peculiar game that can get frustrating and yet enjoyable at the same time. Graphics are pretty good and all achievements are attainable. To get the local co-op achievement you need to play with a friend or if you're an octopus and can handle both controller and keyboard then you are very talented. Otherwise I recommend this game.8/10.

,Recommended,292570,16801234,"Posted: 29 June, 2015",all,Born 2 Game YT,A very simple game but is quite fun to play. The objective is to just run around the garden eating 2 different couloured monsters and switching the colour of the rings around your character in order to match the colour of the monster. I got it in the sale and don't think it's worth full price but if it's on sale it's worth giving a go :D

They say in the description they were thinking about adding online multiplayer later at some point, but that idea seems to have been dropped when they shifted focus to making the superior Wii-U version. I could be wrong, but I don't think they've added any of the new features and modes from ""Party"" to the PC version of the game. It feels abandoned and that's really disappointing because I adore this game. I really think its great. That's why I'll still recommend it. But the fun dies out quickly as a singleplayer experience and my friends aren't local, so I can't tap into the potential longevity of the multiplayer modes. Maybe one day they'll release a better version... until then..."

The music just fits perfect in the game and the artwork just looks amazing. The game is very very simple and there is not a lot to do it the game. But i enjoyed playing all the levels at 5 minutes each and loved every bit of listening to the music while i ate the enemy.3/5 Stars:1 Star for Artwork1 Star for Good Audio Music/Game Sound1 Star for creativity * I just love the Minions *Recommendations:Make for levelsAdd for Music Sounds * Because you guys did a great job *Review By,Turkey Master"

I picked this up on a whim (while it was on sale I think) and was not disappointed.   It isn't exactly a deep game but if you ever enjoyed playing pac-man or mouser back in the old days you might just find this little game to be fun for a while.  It has player vs player and co-op gameplay however it's local only and there's no online play through steam."

,Recommended,292570,14261510,"Posted: 31 January, 2015",all,Meat ★®,"Chompy Chomp Chomp is a small and fun game to play. In Battle mode you simply control two Chompies where you have to eat and avoid getting eaten by other chompies running around various mazes.In the Arcade Single Player mode, you have to eat as much Blobidee's as you can as the queen Blobidee follows you about.Other modes have Chompies that are all controlled by other players.It's just how easy the controls are and how quickly you can just get in to gameplay which is a positive feature right there.There could be, however, a few more features added to the game like bigger mazes, an increased number of reduced sized chompies on a maze at a time in Battle mode, and improved powerups.Overall this game is energetic, challenging and fun, giving it 7/10 for now. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is looking for something that is worth its price. :3"
