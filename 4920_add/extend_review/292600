I wouldn't recommend you try to play this at the end of your day. You'll go to bed taking a purple jab.The replay value is up there-you can get ""Perfection"" on each level, which is achieved by not dying at all. There are also challenges that you can complete that challenge you to best your previous completion time.Take into mind the quote by Albert Einstein that the narrator reiterrates, ""Repeating the same action but expecting new results is a sign of madness."""

,Recommended,292600,20226614,"Posted: 2 January, 2016",all,Calistus,"This game treads the line between puzzle and reflex-based gameplay. The gameplay is entirely skill, so any time you get sent back to the beginning of the level, it's on you. The difficulty ramps up a little bit slowly for my liking, but once you beat Story mode, you have the freedom to play some really tough levels. On the subject of Story mode, it may look a little short the first time you fire up the game. Make no mistake - it is, but that's not what you're here for. All of Story mode is essentially a tutorial for the Epilogue, Challenge mode, Encore mode, and speedrun mode.As a speedrunner, I feel it necessary to comment a bit more on this game's speedrun mode. In this game, speedrun mode takes you through your choice of Story, Epilogue, or Encore, and you set the pace. You get to adjust what speed you play the game at on the fly. This means you can crank it up to 200% and blast through levels you're comfortable with, and perhaps even drop it down to 100% on levels you'd rather just get out of the way. The timer keeps going if you have to restart a level, after all. I'd like to believe this means no two speedruns will look the same, but I can't say for sure.The art isn't flashy or mind-blowing, but it is absolutely fitting for what the game is. The music, on the other hand, is excellent in my opinion. It's definitely fitting, and while it's not crazy enough to be distracting, it's still good enough that I'd enjoy listening to it while not playing the game. In fact, getting to hear the next chapter's music felt like as much of a reward as actually getting good enough to beat each chapter.Overall, I'd recommend this game, especially at a discount. As a side note, if you've played and enjoyed the game 140, I think you'd really enjoy Duet. If you enjoy Duet, you'd probably like 140 too."

One of the main things i loved was the psychological concept of the game and the voice that reveals its thoughts on every stage, sections of the game are built around the idea of the stages of grief and tying these concepts with the gameplay and also making you wonder about them based on your reaction in game and in real life too. Overall awesome title, im glad it was finally released on Steam.For anyone willing to try a super fun puzzle game that has great ambient music and a great sense of depth --- this is the game you MUST play"

The only controls are turning left or right as the 2 orbs are connected and move at the same time, or tethered in symbiosis as the makers like to call it.There are 9 story chapters 8 epilogue chapters, where each stage starts with a psychologically layered line, making it quite mysterious, maybe even thought provoking for some. There are also various challenges, encore chapters and speedruns. Even though the story chapters are relatively simple you'll still have a lot of content to play after that getting a highscore on endless play or practicing your speedrun for example.After you have played for a while so many movements in the game will come naturally and it'll almost feel as if you're moving automatically and the game is just an extension of your arm, making it a very immersive experience"

Never before have I played a game where I can be both frustrated and relaxed at the same time. Although the game can get quite difficult at times, they do a really good job of easing you into everything you have to do. I also found that the quotes were very inspirational and at times were able to brighten my day.

If you're scared off by that, then don't worry this game is much more approachable then those previous games and can be enjoyed by more casual players while still providing some tough challenges for hardcore players in its later levels and its other modes.The game is very simple, you dodge and weave around each block, leaving a trail of paint from each death. When you finally beat a level, it’s not only satisfying it’s actually quite beautiful.Simply turn, left or right. Playable with gamepad, keyboard or just mouse. Switch seamless between to whatever you prefer. (Movement is digital, meaning you turn at one constant speed). (Also includes touch controls which I can’t test). I've played the Android version briefly before this, and I find that best version is on PC. Blasting the amazing soundtrack loudly, get hypnotized by the visuals on the big screen and get addicted to the challenge. The added game modes to the PC version make this a very good purchase for just $5, worth the wait."

,Recommended,292600,17408996,"Posted: 5 August, 2015",all,Wolf Revo,"Duet, my favorite mobile game of all time, is now available on PC! And luckily the things that made it so compelling on mobile also work well when sitting at a desk.The closest game I can compareDuetto isSuper Hexagon. They both do everything a mobile game should do: simple controls, easy to pick up and put down quickly, and minimal graphics that still manage to be beautiful.Duetdoes a few more things to make it worthwhile to continue playing, and because of that I believe it is a better game.InDuetyou control the rotation of two spheres: holding down the right arrow key rotates them clockwise, holding down the left arrow key rotates them counterclockwise. The only task the game gives you is to avoid the white obstacles as they fall from the top of the screen. It is much easier to understand if you see it in action, so be sure to watch the trailer.UnlikeSuper Hexagon, which procedurally generates its obstacles from a set of patterns, each level level in Duet is the same each time you play it. If you hit an obstacle, the sphere that hit bursts and splatters on the obstacle. The game then rewinds to the beginning of the level, and you try again. The splatter stays there, reminding you of your past failure. Once you have completed a level there is a brief pause and the next level begins.The levels are grouped into chapters, each with a title named after a stage of grief. The beginning of each level has a short quote pertaining to the chapter you are in, and it paints a strange story as you play. Each chapter is based around a new type of challenge. They start off simple and then start combining what you learned in past chapters with what you know now. The pace at which they introduce new elements is challenging, but reasonable. I would sometimes hit a level that seemed insurmountable, but determination and perseverance have won out in the end every time.The game rewards you with achievements for each chapter you complete. More challenging achievements exist for things like completing a chapter without hitting a single obstacle. You can also comprehensively compare how well you have done to how well everyone else in the world (or just your friends) have done. I'm hoping that some of my friends on PC will pick up the game so I can crush them on the leaderboards.If the story mode were all there was to the game, it would be short. But there is also an epilogue, several challenge levels, an endless mode, and a daily challenge. At time of writing, I have beaten just over half of the static levels in the game. Even after I have mastered all them the endless mode and the daily challenges will keep me coming back for a long time yet."

When you play in story mode, the levels are grouped in categories; categories with topics such as denial, depression, guilt, anger etc. In the beginning of each level, there is a little phrase about the topic of the category.Every level, I thought about the levels phrase while playing. I know this will sound pathetic but it makes me think about aspects of life, as if it was a piece of art trying to tell me something. It feels like the phrases comes from a person in the game, who I am together with and converse with. Those half- philosophical conversations (which I’m making up while playing) makes me feel like I’m building up a kind of a relationship with the person – just as I would with anyone who I had such personal conversations with. After completing story mode and I began playing challenges, I actually began to think that the game became a little lonely to play without those phrases. Then I found out that there’s also phrases when playing in epilogue mode and encore mode. So there’s still good stuff to come for.I think this game is fantastic."

I don't dislike minimalist styles, and it's not BAD looking, but when you only have two spheres and 3 types of rectangle in your game, I would expect them to look at least a little bit interesting. Not to mention how the constant blur effect makes it surprisingly difficult to see what's going on sometimes, especially with spinning blocks. The visuals are actually detrimental to the gameplay. The pulsing background effects are cool.Gameplay: Memorize sequences of left and right presses. There is some skill involved, but it's basically just remembering how long to push left or right for various combinations of blocks. It's very unrewarding. It is an interesting rotating concept, but it doesn't deliver. Every time you mess up you have to restart the level. Levels are short and the reset takes only a second so it's not a big deal, but it's not fun. That is how I would describe the gameplay here: not fun.It has a minimalist narrative which is pretty cool.Audio: This game actually has a great soundtrack, I really like the background music and when it gets going it starts to tie the game together and make it almost enjoyable. The in game sounds are lackluster. The ""narration"" is a nice touch.In short: It's not terrible, not the worst thing you can buy for sure.

Sometimes you'll feel the urge to plant your fist through the monitor, but completing a level is immensely rewarding.The music adds an entire dimension to the gameplay. If you can play this on the big screen with a controller, I'd highly recommend it."

,Recommended,292600,21715131,"Posted: 8 March, 2016",all,Beefenstein,"This game is like playing abstract poetry. It is truly excellent.The simplicity of the gameplay and controls, plus the excellent music and geometrically trippy  backgrounds, are presumably designed to cause a flow state. At the same time as being vexed at yourself for losing (and leaving yet another smear on the same corner of the same block) you realise that you are unlocking within yourself the correct reactions to conquer next time.Frankly you should buy it just to listen to the soundtrack. The fact the game is also great on top of that feels like an unfair bonus to me."

It's still the same game: challenging gameplay, beautiful design, endless hours of content, well worth the price. After failing over and over again at the start, you'll begin to see the patterns and find your way through the game. I'd say this might be a less challenging version of Super Hexagon but with many more levels and an even better soundtrack."

76561198040892981,Recommended,292600,27509848,"Posted: 25 November, 2016",all,cloudshaper2k,This is an addictive little puzzle/dexterity game. It reminds me a lot of Super Hexagon. You will fail - a lot - but the short time between checkpoints will keep you from becoming discouraged. The simple design elements encourage a kind of zen like instinctive response to the challenges coming at you. Highly recommended.Also of note: the inclusion of achievements for completing the levels without dying gives something to strive for even after you've beaten the level.

There is a story of sorts, too.Recommended for fans of the above mentioned games."

I feel like people keep not recommending this because it has a mobile version but honestly I found the PC version much easier and I paid for the mobile version too. I feel like people who are into minimalistic, atmospheric, mildly challenging games will be into this. I love these type of games like Hook and klocki and Hocus and now this. It's good both for warming up and winding down your brain. I have a lot of love for this game and its simplicity. Voice acting is good too. On mobile I never had my headphones on (even though it recommends it) but this time I did and it was very satisfying. Give it a go! If not for the full price then wait for a sale."

The soundtrack is ambient and relaxing as it TRIES to convince you NOT to pull all your hair out.  Tricky game that needs only for us to recognize some patterns and that's a lot of fun and it keeps you guessing.  Easily the most fun, simple, mellow, intense, and inexpensive when on sale.  I got it for $.99 I think.I highly recommend it if you like Indie, Puzzles, and Great Soundtracks."

Just thought I'd write the insignificant negatives anyway.edit:Oh yeah and very rage inducing, but how would it be perfect without?Also there's these pretty pointless perfect markers for doing a level in a certain number of key-presses, which is for one: stupid, and two, there thankfully aren't achievements for completing them that way anyway. However there is a perfect achievement for completing sections without failing once which isn't marked in game. And no way to nicely restart a section.There could be much harder achievements added as well, though it's nice that the ones available are reasonable. Speedrun mode achievements, for example."

The game's story is an exploration of human emotion, it's designed to make you feel at least one of those emotions, and it's just about as good at the game itself (spoiler: Absolutely amazing).10/10 Still waiting for Continuance mode"
