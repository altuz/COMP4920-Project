The music is annoying, the fullscreen resolution is horrible and the meat of the game - its 'puzzles' are meant to be played by a five-year-old, but not by a grown-up. I felt despair and anger when i tried to click those numbers to make a certain sum, because on hard levels it becomes a simple button mashing without any sense.

Unless you specifically get this game on sale super cheap to get cards I'd advise you to pass, even with cards I'd say walk away from this game.The real challenge of this game is more or less getting to the numbers in time not actually doing the math, choose a wrong number and you have to adapt and factor it in into your sum. Doing the math is easy, getting to the numbers you are going to choose is the problem and every wrong sum or click can get you closer to losing, well for me anyway. Too fast paced, but I guess that's why it's called Pressured."

The numbers you need to select to sum up to reach a given amount move so fast that, even on easy, you'll find some hell of a challenge.For 90% off, it was not a big deal, as the game has cards that, once sold, pratically paid the game. I had to turn off the in-game music after a couple of seconds (very annoying), and got tired of it fast, so I uninstalled it after getting the 3 cards.

A better version of this game could be programmed in your browser, look better, and not cost any money.You click cards to total to a predefined sum, gaining points by reaching that sum and not going over. It is not uncommon, however, for the game simply to not give you that card you need to reach the sum. For example, if the sum is 10, and you currently have 9 points, there will be no 1-point cards.It's a neat concept for a game, but you're better off buying pretty much any other puzzle game. If you're going to spend money on a Steam puzzler, get one with decent graphics that doesn't look like it was made in some high school intro-to-programming class."

The font is a bit odd as well as the theme color. but it's still tolerable. One flaw concerning the gameplay is that when you add up to just 1 less than the target with your sum (e.g. target is 45, you have already 44), there is nearly NO number 1 appearing (I have to say 'nearly' coz I've not been playing long). As the clock ticking, considering the fact that redoing the whole adding up would cause even more time, I normally decide to wait. And the 1 NEVER shows up!"
,Recommended,292620,22338232,"Posted: 10 April, 2016",all,TARRARPAUN,"The premise of Pressured is simple but relatively hard to master. In each level, you are assigned a target number. Your goal is to click on numbers that add up to that target number before the pressure meter fills up. As you click on numbers, your current sum is shown on the top of the screen so that you can keep track of how far off from the target number you are. On the bottom of the screen, you'll be advised as to how many times you need to reach your target number before advancing to the next level. Each time you successful reach the target, some pressure is relieved, in essence, adding more time to complete the level. Easy peasy, right? NOPE! The grid where the numbers are located is constantly shifting. Numbers flash on the screen for no more than a second before new numbers appear, bombs randomly appear (resetting your sum to 0) , and a ""2X"" symbol occasionally pops up (doubling your current sum). Points are earned for each correct target hit and points are lost for hitting bombs or going over the target number. You will need to stay sharp or you will fall to the pressure!It's insanely addicting and an intruiging game. The game is meant to a quick burst of action but you will find yourself trying to best your score after every game. And for under $3 USD, you can't go wrong!"

At the moment, I can barely get past the first few levels on easy but I think a little practice should improve my progression. (ADDITION IS HARD!) Plus I'm playing on my laptop with the touch pad and I think that slows me down. This is clearly a touch screen game so if you're on a computer, definitely use a mouse. The music is ambiet and definitely fits the mood and style of the game, but it's short and repetitive so I turned it off pretty quickly. The gameplay is simple, add numbers together by clicking them until you reach your goal number. The trick is that the numbers keep moving and you have to do it quickly before you ""build up too much pressure."" Overall a challenging brain teaser of a game. It's pretty minimalistic so seems a bit more suited for the $.99 or at best $1.99 price range but $2.99 is not outrageous so worth it if you like a good math blitz game."

Pressured sounds good on the surface, but the execution isn't great.  The game comes off as quite dull, and the overall presentation feels badly done.  There's some ugly contrasting between the background and the font which makes things hard to look at.  While I don't normally criticize a game for its graphics, this one was exceptionally poor.At its core, the game is a math puzzler, which I usually like.  You have a grid of TV screens which quickly flash different numbers.  Clicking on those numbers will add them together.  Your goal in each level is to arrive at a target sum without going over.  Do this 5 times and you move on.  There's an added twist, though.  The number you use to solve one sum can't be used the very next time.  So, if the target is 13, and I use 5+8, then the next time I can't use an 8; I'd have to try 4+9 instead.  As the levels increase, the numbers get higher, so you'll need longer strings of sums.  And of course, there's a time limit, which feels way too short even on Easy mode.You can unlock Normal and Hard modes fairly quickly, and after that there are poems that can be unlocked by meeting certain goals.  As unlockables go, that's got to be the least interesting kind I've ever seen in a game.  I played the game long enough to get the Steam cards (took about 45 minutes, roughly), and I doubt I'll keep playing.  The game is just far too boring.  Normally I feel pretty engaged when I play a puzzler, but this one never hooked me.This game normally sells for $2.99, which definitely isn't worth it.  I got the game 90% off for just $0.29.  In that regard, it's an okay purchase.  And if you sell off the Steam cards, you'll basically break even.  If you're curious, wait until it's dirt cheap to buy it.  Otherwise, just move on and find another puzzle game to play."

For someone who loves math puzzles :)Among the things I'd improve/change:- slightly longer times for numbers before they disappear (they still disappear too soon for me, I can't read them and find the right number before it disappears and is replaced by a different number);- less eroded fonts, as they're hard to read, especially on transparent numbers that are about to disappear.- added: pressure should drop significantly when a sum is completed. A game is only fun when its do-able, not impossible on Easy (for me its impossible as it is now).Speaking of fons, I like the font used to write the game's name, and its not eroded.But it could be just me being bad at this game.

You will be getting a number, Let's say  ""12"" and you will need to wait until you are correct numbers are shown up on the TV in order to make the ""12"". The TV numbers are changing pretty often and the text font will not be helping either. But that is the game. You just wait, match up the correct numbers and you get some points.Bad Text font.This game is super bad.Super boring.Too repetitive.Too expensive what the game has to offer.The game should be for free.. No wait, just delete this game from steam.Other things.There is literally nothing good about this game.-------------------I Give this game a 1/10"

,Not Recommended,292620,34469024,Posted: 24 August,all,Redbeard,"Pressured is a mathematics game in which you have several rows of boxes with numbers in them and you have to click on the boxes to add them up to reach a target number, over and over again.Then the next level will give you a new target number.Reaching the target number has to be done within a set time, hence the ""pressure"" part of the game.Unfortunately, sometimes the target numbers are not very legible - the developer should have used a better font. If you read the number incorrectly, or if you have to stop to try to read it again, then you're going to get a very low score, because of errors and/or time wasted.Also, it would have been better if there was a clearer delineation when changing target numbers - when I first played the game, and reached the target number, I was waiting for the next one, unaware that the next target number starts straight away.You can get over the poor target change delineation, but the font problem really needs to be fixed.If you're into maths, then it could be an OKish sort of game.However, I found it rather boring. I guess it just wasn't my style of game.3/10."

This was not an accident, but a conscious choice for artifical difficulty.  It should also come with an age bracket warning, as basic math is not something most people would find a challenge, even with an artifical time limit."
