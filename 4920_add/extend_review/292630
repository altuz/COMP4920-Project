Here are my thoughts.Here's what you're getting into if you play it:A dystopian space voyage through vaguely H.R. Giger-themed terrain.A loop of 80's synth that will quickly begin to rot your soul.Neon-colored, hard to read text with very amateurish voice acting.A story of a nun on a mission to uncover the reason behind a galactic monastery's disappearance.A space ship that uses a hallucinogenic drug-powered laser to mine bible verses from meteorites.Riding a container of drugs through a bullet-hell style side scrolling shooter while gunning down crosses.A final showdown with a godlike creature that makes it hard to tell what exactly the message of this game even is.Is it a bad game?No, not at all considering the dozens of space shooters that demand your 5 dollars without any sort of charm or originality. (Here's looking at you, Blast Em.)The visuals are weird, the gameplay is janky, and I probably won't play it ever again. What this game did that so many games I've played have not, however, was give me an experience I will remember, and I think that's worth a positive review.PS- I got this game for 50 cents. If you paid more than that, disregard this entire review. You ♥♥♥♥ed up."

76561198021732466,Recommended,292630,12156515,"Posted: 19 September, 2014",all,severin777,"I'm sitting here trying to think of how to review Uriel's Chasm, and it is extremely difficult. Let me start by first saying that I don't think Uriel's Chasm should be given a normal game review, as it is not a normal game, I would even hesitate to call it a game. It is both more and less than a game, it is an experience. It is most definitely not for everyone, it's not even for most people I would surmise; However if you are reading this review you contain that spark of interest, and in which case I recommend that you buy it (it's not very expensive) and try it for yourself.The game contains 4 levels, the last was added in an update. The gameplay is simplistic, and excepting the last level not very challenging. The game is very short as well, probably about 30 minutes to beat, less once you know what you're doing.  Do not buy this for the gameplay, that is not where the appeal lies. I know that sounds counter-intuitive, but I am a firm believer of games as art; they can be for more than entertainment! I like gameplay just as much as the next gamer, and more than some, but sometimes I want more than empty entertainment. And art is exactly what this game is, make no mistake. The game literally calls itself rubbish, so I feel that people that complain about the gameplay are missing the point entirely.The graphics are excellent, though primitive, and contain some very memorable images ( the hidden face especially ) that combine with the superb music to create an extremely surreal, trippy, oftentimes quite disturbing aesthetic. I cannot comment on the story other than to say it is 'out there' for sure. It is very obtuse and to me didn't make much sense. I am not the type of person to really read a bunch of stuff into something, I'm not very good at that. I can't deny though that it did conjure up some very powerful emotions, something very few games do.I could go on and still not be able to describe this game as it is something that needs to be experienced. If you have any interest I urge you to try it, form your own opinion. I feel sad that me and like 5 other ♥♥♥♥ing people like the game."
,Not Recommended,292630,22520737,"Posted: 19 April, 2016",all,tenshi_a,"I don't recommend this game, but I don't think it's nearly as bad as the reviews make it out to be, which is actually a little bit disappointing for me. I really was hoping it was as bad as the reviews led me to believe! Oh well, I will do my bit to add to its infamous ""Overwhelmingly Negative"" aggregated review score. :)It's a very short game about the dangers of blind faith in Christianity. I think.Or maybe the dangers of having faith so fragile that a mere bad 1990s video game could really upset a person. Perhaps.Or maybe it's about how ridiculous ""soccer moms"" and people in the media in the 1990s were, saying that playing video games (and/or listening to Heavy Metal music) could turn people to Satanism, or turn them into zombies, or create severe mental health problems, or nervous breakdowns, etc - whereas nowadays video games are even more widespread and as far as I know, the world did not become overrun with Satanists.Or maybe... maybe it is actually face value made by some people who find the idea of the depiction of An Angry God in a video game really really upsetting and disturbing.The point is not clear. I guess it has at least given me something to think about.It feels oddly like there was a lot of effort put into the artwork, the concepts, the scenes, and yet... everything also seems extremely limited. Like... there's some proper talent there but it's busy trying to get an idea across so it doesn't bother with the details, and just does the bare minimum for each piece and slaps them all together.I think playing the game isn't the point. I think playing the game was just the vehicle to getting something across.But I'm not entirely sure what that something was.Finished it in half an hour. It's not a hard game. Only one trading card dropped. Don't really feel it's worth sticking round any longer.I don't feel cheated at having bought this game at 90% off. I think 39p seems about right for this experience, whatever it was supposed to be.One thing: I really wish this game had subtitles for the FMV bits. I know part of the aesthetic of the game would be broken, but the fellow near the end of the game, before the last boss, is far too quiet and muffled. Perhaps that is also part of ""the point"". Who knows?!"

,Not Recommended,292630,24150450,"Posted: 6 July, 2016",all,Xepherian,"This game was the third game I've reviewed for my ""Steam Redlight"" series, where I review games when they're 'in the red' in reviews to see if it's deserved or not.You can see the review / reaction videohere.In summary, I can't recommend this game to somebody unless I wanted them to repent for this cardinal sin in which they've committed by playing this game.In this game, you play as Sister Tabitha, some person who's been asleep for like eight years. She wakes up and has this epiphany where she has to find ""Enoch's Hope"" which is a monastery in space.No idea when that got there, but it ended up getting lost somehow.The game has four levels, each one with a different game-style as if the developer couldn't make his mind about what kind of game he wanted. Here's the break-down by level:Level one, you dodge dip dive duck and dodge through space shooting asteroids in a top-down shooter. In these asteroids are bible fragments which you need to collect in order to get into the garden. You also collect drugs and shoot down Cherubs.Level two, a bullet Hell that's not too difficult if you've played bullet Hell's before. If you have, you'll find this terribly easy. Nothing special here, but probably the most fun part of the game... which is unfortunate. The boss of this level is none other than the fabledSocrates, who has played a huge role in the creation of the bible, or something.Level three, a platformer with absolutely zero risk of dying. The only reason I had trouble on this level is because I decided to press ESC, which I should mention,brings you back to the Start Menu. You're delusional if you think this game has a save or continue function. Go talk to Jesus who's just hanging around for some infinite insight.This is the final level. Bull Hell-y, but more like Ikaruga in the sense. The final boss is just something I can't talk about as it's an unspeakable horror. This level is slightly challenging if you have fingers the size of russet potatoes.So now that that's out of the way -- the game is messy. A lot of things are unexplained, and I feel like Rail Slave Games tries to cover their♥♥♥♥♥by claiming it as a feature:#Discussions_QuoteBlock_Author- Rich Context that infinitely rewards further investigation.No my friend, I'm pretty sure you're just a disciple of George Lucas who loves plot holes and unexplained storylines. The game leaves you with more questions at the end than you had at the beginning. Other than that, the gameplay isn't exactly interesting. It has basic mechanics that it manages to implement without bugs, so it has that going for it. There's these strange videos that appear in between levels that seem like they've had their quality nukedon purpose. These videos provide nothing else other than to tell you to use ""Z"" and the ""Arrow Keys"" in the very beginning of the game; otherwise they're irrelevant.If for some reason you want to read all the biblical references it shares with you, this game doesn't provide an adequate amount of time. In level one, you only have until you pick up the next page to read it, and sometimes you pick them up in quick succession. Level three, Jesus only speaks to you for like six seconds, and sometimes he has a lot to say. My guess is that he's free-styling or something, which justifies the speed you have to read it at. Also, there is absolutely no explanation as to why the final boss is what it is. Googled for a decent amount of time. I have no answers here.Score & BreakdownScore: 3/10+5 for Existing+1 for no gamebreaking bugs+1 for respectable gameplay mechanics-1 for not making sense 90% of the time-1 worst cutscenes in world-1 for making me fight Socrates-1 for garbo soundtrackIf you think this review cured♥♥♥♥♥cancer, then you may be interested in seeing the actual review in its fully URL's glory below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwgsYV9lpqU"

,Recommended,292630,12105383,"Posted: 14 September, 2014",all,Thaumiel,"(The description for this game flat out lies. There's no metaphysics here, and VERY little ""rich context"" that in NO WAY can be investigated.)I greatly enjoyed this game, but I would not reccomend it to most people. You have to have a very specific taste in these kinds of psychedelic games in order to appreciate it. Oh, and it takes 15-30 minutes to complete the game.Uriel's Chasm is a very complex enigma. First off, I would like to say that there is no ""Shovelware Queens"" as the description would have you beleive. I wanted to see their playthrough, so I googled it and searched for around 4 hours, and literally nothing even mentioning them popped up. This game is not based off an unliscened bible game, this is a game entirely handmade, not a revamp of a game from the 90's.I would try to give this game a traditional review, but that is impossible. The appeal in Uriel's Chasm is not the gameplay. The appeal lies in something more abstract, perhaps the game's overall aethsetics. This game is more of a commentary on other things than a game in of it's self. This is a fancy way of saying, the gameplay basically sucks. The second level is a very well made side-scrolling bullet hell, but the first and third levels are tedious. Now, don't get me wrong, I greatly enjoyed each level, but not because of normal reasons. It is a lot like Sluggish Morss in how it is presented.The enclusion of DMT is what made me buy this game, and what made me realize that this isn't a remake of a very old game. Why would someone trying to sell a christian game advertise DMT?The best part about this game is the ending. I found the whole concept of this game to be extremely innovative, and I am excited to see more games like this."

,Not Recommended,292630,29155224,Posted: 9 January,all,Jpdaniel,"The game is trying to do surrealist horror, but really just fails. The cutscenes are pretentious and preachy meant to just tell us how bad the game is instead of letting the game speak for itself. No, we need the girls in-between going ""oooh, this is so bad, uuugh. Why would God say that?"" and it all builds to a non-climax that comes out of nowhere and goes nowhere.The game-within-the-game is not horrifying. It just drops you straight into the surreal without any sense of contrast for the normal. There is no build to make it creepy or shocking, you're just dropped straight into the mix.On the subject of the gameplay, I have to ask. Why is it garbage? The point in the story is that this is supposed to be built as some crappy bargain bin christian game, but it has the horrifying imagery right at the start so throw out the subtle build there.And in the end, I have to ask: why buy this game for five dollars? For the horror? There is none. For the game? It sucks. For the artistic merit? You'd really have to define that, because if this is artistic, i can whip up something in the time it takes to play this game to rival it. For the amount of time, effort, and reason to play this game obviously took and gives, it should be free. Not on steam.That said, there's some impressive pixel art in here. Totally think the developer could be part of a dev team working art."

On one of the far ends of the dial there was a station called ""Network 1"".  In the evenings it would show little more than bad B movies, randomly placed 90's music videos, and terribly dubbed 80's anime.  Plus, nearly all the commercials were advertizements for phone chat 1-900 numbers.  It was badly done and amateurish, but it was one of the most fun stations I've ever watched.  It felt raw and unregulated, like I was watching something made from an underground entertainment industry, never intended to be seen by the general public.  The kind of place where cult classics are born.  I couldn't help but enjoy it, simply because it felt so unrepentantly wild.  There is freedom in witnessing something that is not bound by the constraints of normal behavior, even if you aren't a part of it.Uriel's Chasm reminded me very much of Network 1.  It's strange in a way that a VAST majority of the people who play it will not enjoy.  However, if you're able to appreciate the fact that this game includes a space nun who strapped a giant tank full of DMT to her back in order to rocket into another plane of reality, possibly even into the mind of God, then I would encourage you to play it."

It's actually a rather amazing game, although I can't say I understood all of it. It combines biblical themes with a bizarre meta plot told through recordings of people who ""found"" the game. The effect is not unlike Marble Hornets or similar works, although I wish it went a bit farther with it. The gameplay changes from section to section, though is usually a shooter of some kind - all of them were very fun, with the possible exception of the third one which was more of a simplistic platformer.

I'm skeptical of the notion that games are art (I think Kojima was right when he said games are a service), but there's certainly unruly fodder for the argument here.As noted in the copy, No-Wave scene musician/poet/whatever Jarboe does the in-game voice-over here. No-Wave music was notable for being deliberately abrasive, noisey and antagonistic, punk rock carried out to its logical extreme. Dare I say the music set out to be unlistenable. In the No-Wave documentary ""Kill Your Idols"" one musician who was pivotal in the scene admits that he rarely listens to this sort of music and spends most of his time listening to generic pop. I bring this up because Uriel's Chasm is a sort of ""No-Wave Game"" - it sets out to be un-fun, which gave me the strange feeling that the game was a joke on the part of the developer.Most of the game is structured as some sort of shmup, be it the first stage's mash up of Asteroids and the first Thunder force, the second level's side-scroller, or the Director's Cut-additional final boss stage's Invaders clone. From a gameplay standpoint the problem is none of them are very fun. The first stage require's you to fill up your ""faith gage"" by picking-up items dropped by destroyed asteroids, or just waiting, as the gauge slowly fills on its own. Guess which one I opted for? The second stage is the most playable, given the mercifully small hitbox your character has (hint: it's the cross on your sprite). The final stage is barely-playable given the headache inducing spray of bullets, which painfully flash white and black (I don't advise this game for anyone prone to seizures). It's worth mentioning that what I presume to be the end-boss (I gave up when my eyes ached and my head started throbbing) is scored to a track consisting of Jarboe's sampled grunts and screams over which plays her monotone free-verse poetry. It's easily the most unpleasant final boss I've ever had the mispleasure of playing, which wasn't aided by the ship's enormous hitbox.That being said, the aesthetic angle of the game is interesting. The set-up is essentially that you're ""playing"" a clumsy ""let's play"" video (I realize that phrase is redundant), with non-""in-game"" cutscenes consisting of the hosts commenting on the game, some of it being humourous, at least blackly-so. The game's certainly colourful, too, while the unlicensed head-trip bible game trappings keep things fresh. Light CRT and unlicensed-game-visual-glitchiness simulation is also a nice touch.The real star of the game is its soundtrack. Simply put, it kicks♥♥♥♥♥ Be it the second stage's homage to the Megadrive or the ♥♥♥♥♥in' shoegaze epilogue, the music at least keeps one part of this admittedly short game enjoyable.It would be nice if it were possible to give this game a ""mid"" rating, given it fits what one reviewer said of the film Demon Seed. To paraphrase, it's definitely not a classic, and it can't be said that it's even any fun, but in the end players with the right frame of mind won't have wasted their forty minutes. Just don't torture yourself with that end boss. Life's too short."

I feel like this was the history of the universe explained by some Christian-Scientology off-shoot cult. The controls seem to function, the graphics aren't abysmal, and the music is cool the first loop. Other than that there is really nothing good about it.Here is my intial playthrough of the game if you want to check it out."

I would recommend this if you're like drunk or something, or bored, or want a cheap laugh, or need something to dull the pain after watching Sex Lives of the Potatomen. So I guess it's alright for that.Giraffe boss fight is pretty steller I guess. Giraffe is God? Probably?"
