Well, that's probably because it's from 2009, not 2014 as the steam page incorrectly says. But okay, it's not like hidden object games have made a lot of progress recently.So with that out of the way... I still wouldn't have liked this game 5 years ago. It seems to be aimed at girls age 5-7 or something like that. Most of the puzzles are overly simple, and some are even more illogical than you'd expect from this type of game, like ""let's make a potion to cure this room!"". Erm, no thanks. Also, I completed it in less than 2 hours despite getting stuck for a good while because I missed a room and couldn't figure out how to move on as only rooms you've been in are marked on the map.The one good thing this game does is marking a room as clear once you've found everything in it. Unless you enjoy searching for pixels everywhere when you get stuck, I suppose.But yeah, there's so many better hidden object games for a similar price. I see no reason to get this one."

The game was developed by Gogii Games in 2009, and its age does little to worn out the naive beauty of the setting and the unconventional gameplay. It still is a very good purchase.Crown princess Isabella returns to Castle Greystone for his marriage to Prince Adam, only to find the castle in ruins, all rooms cursed and the royal family trapped in mirrors! She is quickly joined by her fairy companion to investigate the matter, while collecting pieces of mirrors to save royal family and undo the curse if possible. All witnesses speak of a vile witch visiting the castle and putting a curse over the land, yet torn pages from our mother's diary indicate another forgotten secret to be uncovered. As being a trained magician herself, Isabella travels within the castle, solving puzzles, collecting mirror fragments and lifting curses over rooms. Will you be able to face the witch and save your family in the end?Plot explanation aside, this game is a classic for the HOG genre. Art works and character designs are a beauty, even though they've been aged in the digital era. Voice acting is more than decent, bringing a vivid side to the whole setting. The storyline is actually curious, with a nice plot twist by the end. Sadly, the Steam overlay doesn't work, and the game has no achievements or such due to its age.Gameplay is basic HOG; collecting items and solving puzzles. Neither HOG scenes nor puzzles are actually challenging, but there is a logic presented in all HOG scenes - which was new at the time. We use most of the items we collect through HOG scenes, either for puzzles, or concocting potions to lift curses. The ending scene is unique in the HOG genre, by presenting a boss battle - a timed HOG challenge between you and the AI - which was never used in any other game aside the series in the genre. Map has a teleport function and you are declared when you complete all there is to do in a room, marking it as cleared. By the end, the game presents you 2-3 hours of clean cut fun.Princess Isabella - aside being a bit fluffy on the tone - is a good purchase for all casual gamers and a must have for all HOG lovers. The last game of the series,Princess Isabella: The Rise of an Heirhas just been remastered by Artifex Mundi, possibly upping the quality of gameplay a couple notches. I strongly recommend the series as a whole.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"
,Recommended,292660,18968146,"Posted: 9 November, 2015",all,talgaby,"Short version: 87%Despite its age, Princess Isabella is still one of the most enjoyable hidden object games, memorable for the quality of its voice acting, and the rather easy, but still fun mechanics.Long version:Princess Isabella: A Witch’s Curse, with its original 2009 release date, was one of the earliest hidden object games that left behind the old timed scavenger hunt mechanics to turn this genre into the lightweight point ‘n’ click adventure format we know it as now.For an early pioneer, it aged remarkably well. Many of its features like the map system are still used with almost no change in the original formula. If it ever received an update on the old low-resolution graphics and the photo cut-out hidden object items, it could be a fresh new hit even with today’s saturated HOG market.The storyline too is in line with most HOGs: we play as the titular princess, who arrives home to a desolate castle, where she has to solve a series of puzzles and challenges to lift a curse and save the residents. She has a fairy helper to act as a hint system and to keep company: her presence is a welcomed addition, as she is far from annoying, and she adds some life to the otherwise empty castle rooms.There is even a boss battle, believe it or not: the last challenge is a hidden object duel against the computer– a fun minigame  that surprisingly no other HOGs (except the sequels) copied."

Engaged to Prince Adam, she is ready to marry him but upon returning to her castle, she discovered it cursed. It's up to her to find who did that and why. And save the prince in distress.It's a nice litte HOG: visuals are good, soundtrack is good and the idea to dispel the curse of each room in different ways is also nice. The little faery that escaped the evil fate helps you and can gain abilities that will be needed for going forward and the fact that you need to rebuild mirrors to free people is also a nice addition. While the puzzles aren't hard, the HO scenes are a little hard: indeed, you don't always see what you need as it's really well hidden in the screen.It's a good promise for the rest of the series. Buy it, it's really a polished HOG!"

The voice acting was excellent as was the rest of the sound track.  It reminded me of a Disney type adventure.  It is definitely geared towards young girls, but could be enjoyed by anyone looking for an easy way to spend some clicky time.  I played this with my daughter and we had a blast solving the puzzles and going through the story.  We finished it in one sitting.  The hidden object parts were VERY easy, so keep in mind there will be little challenge for an adult playing this.  The other puzzles got to be a bit much for my daughter so I had to step in now and then and click thorugh a puzzle here and there.  Overall an enjoyable experience."

The rest of the game is ok, even if the resolution seems a little low/scaled up in places.The game uses block letters (caps) throughout, is mildly scary, and looks to be suitable for any age. Because it teaches the clock and musical notation, it could even be considered education; hidden object games exercise the ability to concentrate, and there are some logic puzzles as well.The game encourages the player to smash vases and other vessels in search of treasure, and it considers snakes and insects evil.The game delivers what you expect - nothing less, nothing more."

,Recommended,292660,15745589,"Posted: 8 May, 2015",all,HimeJezabel,"Cute Disney-princess-like puzzle/hidden object game. Probably best suited for kids as the puzzles are easy and the fairy helper easily hints/solves the puzzles if you're stuck.The player controls princess Isabella after she came home to her castle, which was cursed in her absence. Move from room to room and remove the curse in each room. There is some backtracking, but as the map lets you jump to rooms, this is not a problem. Your fairy companion gains abilities as you progress through the castle.I encountered one bug only and it was getting 2 of the same item as I clicked too fast to pick it up. It did not change the game in any way other than having that extra item in my inventory.There is some seriously flawed logic in this game; of course the normal magic/fairy, but also ""lighting this fire will remove the curse from the room because warm = not evil"" while in another room""putting out this fire will remove the curse from the room"". wut. There is no punishment for missclicking in the hidden object games other than not being able to click for a few seconds. The fairy will help you complete if you're stuck.Decent graphics, music and voice acting. Very Disney-like in sound effects. I had to turn down the music and sounds as there are too loud compared to the voices on default. A lot of small cutscenes, but all are skippable by mouse-clicking.Recommended for younger players, really cute game."

The music often overpowers the dialogue and there are a high number of repetitive loud noises to announce the smallest advances or simply the changing rooms.It is very random which dialogue or scene is unskippable. Usually you are forced to watch or listen to the most repetetive ones.The ""assistant"" you get is not only graphically distinct from the game, but darts all over the screen to pick up objects you find or if you even slightly touch an interactable area.Incessant popup notifications on certain collectables, even though the information is already on-screen and available via a menu."

The 'little helper' is patronising, and yet still remarkably unhelpful.

I clicked ""yes"" but it's with reservations. This game feels like it was really geared towards children. The plot is very simple and the puzzles are incredibly easy. I played through this is a little over an hour, and if I had paid more than the $1.99 sale price, I would have been pretty unhappy.I was also very annoyed with several of the minigames where you had to find all the ""evil"" in order to progress. ""Evil"" in this case were things like bats, spiders, snakes (so many snakes), skulls -- things that were not evil inherently. As young girls are the target audience for this game, I was irritated at this reinforcement of the idea that those things are bad and icky, instead of fascinating cool things that could be studied."

Play it ONLY if you're a completionist; the sequels are so much better.90% of the difficulty of the hidden object scenes was deciphering the wretchedly low resolution graphics, trying to figure out what a bunch of pixels might be. All of the minigames wouldn't be difficult to a kindergartener, and the game was as linear as it gets, there was never any question of where something would be used. The story was so bad it actually hurt. The voice acting was passable, though the fairy is as repetitive and annoying as Navi.Bad programming meant the windowed screen was tiny, and a technical glitch kept the game from staying in fullscreen, so I had to use magnifier. Ugh.In short, why the hell did I buy this?"

It's just the right amount of chit-chat. Good balance in story and gameplay2) You will mostly play hidden object screens but some have twists to them and you are graced with the occasional mini-games to spice things up.3) The environments are beautiful crafted, showcasing ""dark"" and ""light"" sides. Even the dark sides are interesting to stare at. In short, everything is gorgeous. Period.4) The voice acting is well executed. I didn't hear any cheesy dialogue to complain about.5) The game tells you if the particular room is done! Also, you can warp to the rooms via map! AMAZING, TIME SAVING!6) My only complaint is the sort of abrupt ending... you'll just have to see it to know what I mean.Overall, Princess Isabella is a hidden object game that should not be overlooked! It is a great addition to the genre. Be sure to give it a try! I'll be keeping this one in my library!"

Some of the puzzles are surprisingly difficult considering the age of the market that the game seems to be aimed at and younger players will need assistance in places.Overall, the game is nicely presented with strong voiceovers, sound effects and music. The graphics fit the setting and my one gripe is that the HO scenes seem to be lower definition that the rest of the game, making finding some objects more difficult than need be, due to low detailing.Having said that, if you can deal with the ""Disney Princess"" theme and story, it's a solid HOG, even for more experienced players."

Get it on sale and the cost-value makes it an apparent worthy choice if you like hidden-object puzzle games. The hidden-object elements and the puzzles are not overly complicated, and both in terms of interface and theme/plot I would rate it as a children's game. Still, even for adults it is what you might call a ""cute diversion.""The audio effects are acceptable if sometimes arcade-ish, and the music score is decent if not great. The interface is simple yet functional. The graphics are about on-par with my experiences with other hidden-object games - not mindblowing, but not ugly. Functional system all around. There is a (mostly, see below) unlimited help/hint system, and the game has the feature of a map that lets you move to any area without having to transition through the various screens normally associated with travel in adventure games. Neat feature.There is one puzzle toward the end of the game that is ""real-time"" action-oriented and basically an arcade-style click-fest - not my idea of fun or something I think belongs in an otherwise relaxing adventure game - but people from the console generation might not notice as out of place. I could not finish the game because of it, but as I picked this up for a dollar and for that it was a few hours of mindless entertainment, I cannot rate is as ""unrecommended"" because of that flaw."
