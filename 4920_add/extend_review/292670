Coming out from Gogii games as its predecessor, the game narrates another chapter in the titular princess' life and her lifelong enmity with a witch.Years after princess' adventure and commotion with the witch, the curse returns to her land. It's been several years now that she's been happily living with her husband, and baby daughter Bella; but dark shadows summoned by the witch infiltrate the castle and abduct Bella. They had an unfinished business after all. Isabella takes on a journey throughout her kingdom this time, facing witch's forces, aiding townsfolk cursed by the said witch and searching for her beloved daughter. Will she prevail and return Bella to safety?The game is a loveable continuation to the series, with beautiful background art, hand drawn characters and fairytale design. Game being old, you shouldn't expect a miracle about resolutions though. In tone, it is somewhat childish and carries the nativity of the first game. This time, we are also capable of observing the realm of Isabella a bit more closely, weaved from countless European fairytale references. Our fairy companion - who is also happened to be Bella's godmother - is also present to accompany our quest just like old days, alongside a dragon hatchling named Nessie who joins us just recently. They both have different abilities and interaction options to aid you in your quest.HOG scenes are quite basic and items are distinguishable despite the age of our graphics. Puzzles are various and a bit more of a challenge compared to the previous game, but item collection is all over the place. Due to your companions' various abilities getting unlocked in a timely manner, you'll keep revisiting different locations over and over again to harvest previously unreachable items. The HOG show down with the AI is still our preferred end game boss battle. Oh, and the ending isn't your usually happily ever after; rather a plot hook for the third game to come.In the end, I'd recommend the game if you've played the first one and curious about what is to happen to Isabella. It's not a marvelous HOG, but a pretty little casual adventure game with an enjoyable story outline that would present you 2 hours of game time. Enjoy!Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

This is a standard version not the extended one, which contains longer story line. The ending for the standard version is abrupt and feels very rushed. This is another proof how some companies are trying to generate more cash creating different versions of the same game. Why? Wouldn't be better to have a full story and create a bonus material not relevant to the story? Anyway, when porting old games to the Steam use CE versions instead to attract new players.The game mechanics is similar to any other HO game, it has good interactive map, which helps a lot when the game becomes repetitive. Some voice acting is very annoying especially those of the helpers. And they go on and on, and you can't skip them. Some of the puzzles are too easy some are pretty illogical.In short I would skip playing these games on Steam but would rather got the web site like Big Fish where these games are coming from. You might even get a better deal there."

I wanted to make my point out there by giving negative review.Firstly, there is NO support from the devs at all. I encountered so many bugs and I couldn't get them fixed.Secondly, there is A LOT of bugs that prevent you from progressing or crashes your system.Thirdly, I could not figure out the story and reasons for why something occured, I had to google it and found out that this game is missing HALF of the content that explains things clearly and has more game play.Other than these reasons, this game is very fun and I enjoyed it a lot."
76561198012003855,Recommended,292670,9897461,"Posted: 21 April, 2014",all,Saturna,"This game is a pretty fun addition to the genre. It has some neat mechanics with the helpers' abilities that you can use to locate hidden items. However, this mechanic can also be a bit of a pain, because you have to scan the whole screen for spots to use these powers, which can turn into a pixel hunting adventure. This may only apply to the harder difficulty, I'm not sure, as that's the only one I played.The ending isn't really satisfying, as I guess they are looking to make a follow up. In addition, they claim it has 6+ hours of gameplay, but I beat the game in 3 hours without the use of a walkthrough and did all the puzzles.I'd recommend it if you like playing Hidden Object Games, but the fact that it can be beaten in half the time claimed was pretty frustrating."

Saw it on sale hereon Steam,   and thought,   ""Why Not?""      Especially since I had played the first and third in this series.The faery and the dragon didn't annoy me as much as I thought they would.Despite what another reviewer wrote,  you can click on them while they are speaking just to shut them up.Especially when the dragon is repeating what someone just told you.I actually did enjoy it,  except for some of the HO's  being difficult to find.I like the fact that it has a jump map and you are notified when you are done in an area,so you can just move on.It was at times challenging,  but not overly so.   Puzzles  are solvable without being to simple.If your not sure what to do,    there is a hint helper on top you can click on that will let you know whatto do.    Otherwise,  it stays out of site,  for those who do not want hints.There is a WT  on the Big Fish site for when you get really stuck.Not sure what the CE  would have,  as seeing I played #3  I knew how the story would end."

,Recommended,292670,15748491,"Posted: 8 May, 2015",all,HimeJezabel,"Part 2 of Princess Isabella series and better than the first one.This is not the collectors edition, so it has about 35 minutes less playtime as it's missing the CE version only area ""The Witch's Trophy Tower"" and lacks a small part of the story partially explaining the ending of this game.Isabella's baby daughter Bella has been kidnapped by an evil force and Isabella has to follow the evil and de-curse areas as in the first game. In addition to the fairy helper from the first game she here gets a dragon companion with different abilities (but clearly the same voice actor).The game has 2 difficulty modes, I didn't try the lower one but I assume all the clickables sparkle as they would in similar games. Without the sparkling some clickable areas can be harder to see, but normally not hard enough to get frustratingly lost. The map is helpful and you can teleport to any area, as well as see which areas you have cleared.I encountered no bugs whatsoever and the game was very enjoyable. The puzzles felt a little harder than in the first game. Most dialogue is skippable with mouseclick.Though this game seems harder and darker than the first one, it still feels targetted towards kids. Buy it on sale if you liked the first one and/or enjoy this type of game."
76561198056807270,Recommended,292670,11885654,"Posted: 27 August, 2014",all,Sammah,"This is a casual game, which contains point and click and hidden-object components.  It also has two modes. Normal mode caters for players that are more casual.  The mode provides many hints, and important areas are always highlighted. Advanced mode on the other hand gives  the player almost no hints.There has been some improvement over the first Princess Isabella game, particularly in the art and design of backgrounds.  The game’s areas are more varied than its predecessors were.  And it’s very nice that this time around the witch decided to curse more than just a castle with similarly styled rooms!  The ever-changing scenery also seems to have allowed this instalment to have more quirky characters than its predecessor does.  Although I’m pretty sure those dwarves are living in a hobbit hole!The only issue that arose for me when playing this game, as that I came to a puzzle that did not seem to let me manipulate the parts needed to complete it.  Going back to title menu did not fix this.  However, I found that changing the game between screen modes (Fullscreen, Widescreen and Windowed), seemed to allow the game to work out better where the mouse cursor was placed.  So, there is an easy fix if you are to run into this issue.I would recommend this game to people who enjoy these types of games.  If you do not go into it looking for a life changing experience, and just enjoy it for what it is, then this is a fun little game, and worth playing.  Bear in mind it is a little short, but worth the price, particularly if you can get it on sale!"

Much more entertainting than part 1, look amazing and charming - atmosphere is darker, story is darker... and an unexpected ending! And: we have two ""hints"" now, with our beloved little fairy now comes a baby dragon! Yay! Maybe too easy. 8/10"

This game will definitely be a treat for the princess in your life .. or your inner princess."

As a game for adults, it will safisfy your HOG craving, if you can get around the Disney Princess theme.My only complaint is that the game claims to have 6 hours of gameplay, but was beatable in just over 2 hours without having to use the hint option."
