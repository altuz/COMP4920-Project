While there are some slight changes here and there to keep the game feeling fresh, Pajama Sam 2 is packed with all the distinct features that made the first game so amazing: more pointing and clicking, more item collecting and more existential journeys of self-discovery. Instead of collecting socks, Sam collects a large variety of puzzle pieces, which is likely symbolic of the courage and morality he must piece together in order to confront his crippling fear of thunder and lightning. Speaking of puzzles, Pajama Sam 2 is like a puzzle with every piece in its proper place: with its moving story, well-crafted characters and exciting gameplay, this game feels incredibly polished and complete.

There's not much hand-holding and, I won't lie, I got stuck.

The way it's animated plus its music gives it that title in my book. I can find myself exploring one room for an hour, maybe even hours at a time. The frustration of not finding the solution is filled with relaxation and calmness because of the ambient music. The way the worlds are crafted is truly mindblowing. They had a system in which you had to perfect a puzzle to earn a new area, and you would use that new area to earn more puzzles. In layman's terms, to earn more rooms, you had to perfect current puzzles. They ditched that and added the ability to google the solutions. I'm very glad they added this system and was skeptical about buying it. But now that I did buy it, I do not regret it even for a second. One thing I really love about this game is how you don't have to unlock the first room. In a sense, this game is open world. That sense is that many rooms are available to you, and you can choose whether you want to advance into more challenging rooms, or stay where you're at. To get an S in completion, you have to play every variation.Another thing I absolutely enjoy about Pajama Sam 2: Thunder and Lightning Aren't So Frightening is its expasive community. There are lots of flash games for you to sharpen your skills on, and lots of people who can set a good example. I'm sure most of the people who get best times on all the levels have a Youtube channel, so you can probably catch them there. The community may or not be active, but it sure is good and friendly.Overall, in terms of gameplay, music, artstyle, animation, and difficulty (it's not an easy game, but it's not that hard of a game either. It just depends on how much you want to play it), I rate this game:10/10BUY THIS GAME."

One of things I love about some Humongous Games is that you can replay the game and get a few different puzzles that you won't have seen before. The only things I didn't like was that one character would repeat the same dialogue every time you walked past it, which grated on me. However you can press the spacebar I think, to shut it up. Another dislike was the voice acting of Thunder & Lightening but it wasn't that much of a problem. I would recommend this to anyone.

76561198412517946,Recommended,292780,34548993,Posted: 28 August,all,dallin,"In my opinion, Pajama Sam was the best series Humongous ever made, featuring imaginative settings, witty writing, and clever gameplay. Now, I personally think that Pajama Sam 2 isn't quite as good as the first and third games in the series, but that isn't saying much because this is an excellent adventure game. In this entry, Sam decides that he's had enough of a scary thunderstorm, and sets out to put a stop to Thunder and Lightning, who turn out to be sisters in charge of the world's weather. Finding a massive complex called World Wide Weather, he sneaks inside and has an accident that sends the weather operations into turmoil, and now he must find the four missing parts to bring the weather factories back on line, before Thunder and Lightning lose their jobs.One point of criticism I have is that the big conundrum in the game  is all Sam's fault. That doesn't hurt my enjoyment of the game, but I don't like it when the main objective of game is undoing the protagonist's mistake. It would have been better if Sam had arrived just after things went awry, lending some mystery to what caused the problem; maybe Foster Boondoggle, who never appears in-person in the game, could secretly be the perpetrator who we confront at the end.Otherwise, the game is just what you'd expect from a Pajama Sam game: exploring a boy's wild imagination, populated by characters who are mostly living furniture and in a fun, nonsensical setting. The game world is a mix of industrial and corporate environments, contrasting with both PJ Sam 1 and 2. You'd think this would be boring, but the game is so imaginative that it's every bit as fun to explore as the other games. Something else that just occurred to me is the first three PJ Sam games each occur at different times of the day: PJ Sam 1 is at night, 2 is during the day, and 3 is during twilight. Having a fourth game kind of screws up that pattern, but oh well.All in all, this is a great game for kids, and also for any fan of adventure games. In fact, I'd recommend any of the Pajama Sam or Spy Fox games for any adventure gamer, regardless of age."
