I could have done the demo with my eyes shut, but I never got to play the actual game. That said, when I saw that this was on Steam, I was ecstatic.I will say, I don't think that this is quite as good as the original Pajama Sam, but that could be the fault of my rose-colored nostalgia glasses. Even so, this is still a worthy addition to the Pajama Sam series, and a fun point-and-click puzzle game for the kids."

As he reaches for the last box, a familiar voice calls out. ""Sam, it's time for dinner!"" Not feeling quite hungry for a meal, Sam notices something strange. The cookies come to life! As they flee, Sam searches for a logical place - the pantry. The door shuts, trapping Pajama Sam into a world full of scrumptious sweets, delectable delights, and tasty treats.You play as Sam, a little boy looking to stop the general from declaring war. How does Sam do this? He needs to find members of each food group so they can hold a conference together. The only problem is...they've gone missing! Pajama Sam will need to consume candy canes to escape prison, drive on a donut, resolve balance between beans, and much more. The cool thing about this game (and the other Humongous Entertainment games) is that your second gameplay might be different than the first. The different food groups might be in different places next time, so replay value is actually fun.I loved the creativity put forth in this game. Foods  of all sorts come to life with memorable personalities.-Strong, beefy muffins draw cupcakes on the coast.-Candy canes substitute jail bars.-The names. Plums nicknamed ""plummers."" A granny smith apple named Granny Smythe. The sweet troops marching around.Fans who have not played this game yet will love the cameo appearances. The carrot from the first Pajama Sam game makes a return. There's also Sprinkles the Donut who helps Sam travel. (It reminds me from Otto from PS1).Not only is this a fun game, the name is definitely true. Sam makes a valid point at the end of the adventure. You are what you eat from your head to your feet."

TurcotteThis game is a brain twister; you must use your head, but also have common scene. I remember playing this game and not know what to do. Until thinking of the obvious. I totally recommended this game to every crowed! Adult or child. You’ll have fun!If your child has played beginning level software and is ready to move on to more advanced gameplay, Humongous Entertainment's Pajama Sam series (and Freddie Fish and Putt-Putt as well) are an excellent choice. These titles take the cognitive tasks up a notch as children must accumulate specific items, navigate a number of locations, and use their problem-solving skills to help new friends and achieve larger goals. Along the way, funny and lovable Pajama Sam will meet a number of nice characters, visit a variety of interesting locations and play mini-games as he completes the larger task of getting a representative of each food group out of a pickle so they can get to an important meeting. Along the way he will solve a lot of smaller puzzles and click on many objects that dance or act out funny events. Specifics change if you start a new game, and you will want to play with your child a few times before they'll be able to enjoy it on their own, so each game is good for hours of fun."

It gave me a chance to finally have a closure to one of my favourite childhood game.Throughout the game, it gave me a very nostalgic feeling as we've been constantly playing games of high graphical quality, contrasting a lot with the graphics of games used in the 2000, making me enjoy every moment of it.Even though this game is recommended to kids of ages 3-8, it doesn't seem that way as I'm sure that there are many adults here that would like to ride the nostalgia train and enjoy the game like how we used to when we were kids. Playing it as an adult sometimes surprises me at times as I remembered completing a particular stage of the game as a kid, but was stuck at it for a while when replaying it as an adult. I'm proud that I've not succumbed to the temptation of reading guides when I'm stucked since guides of any games are so readily available everywhere on the internet now. I mean, there ain't many guides when I was a kid and I almost completed the game. Even if there is, I doubt I know how to surf the internet at that age.To those that have played the game before as a kid, but have never completed it before, or simply just want to play the game for nostalgic purposes, it is worth every penny to buy the game."

After playing the games I can only say - what a shame that I didn't have them as a kid! I'm positive I would fall in love with them, because they have everything you want from a kids' game - a good message, funny and memorable characters (especially Sam who's just the cutest kid ever), an environment you can interact with, minigames and, surprisingly, very smart sense of humour. If you have children, I stongly recommend that you play Pajama Sam series with them, and if not - just try it yourself, it may very well return you to your own childhood. It sure did that for me."

As the games progress, they really do get hard and the map in this one was HUGE (or felt huge). It was a little difficult, but as with anything, you do something enough times and you'll be fine. I'm not the biggest fan of how they laid out the body (the eyes were surprisingly far from the brain) and how they portayed the whole argument of the food pyramid but it worked. I actually liked the lesson Sam learns. Very redeeming and very true.The biggest plus of this game wasOne: We get to meet our favorite orange friend againTwo: We get to go on another crazy Pajama Sam adventureThree: The writers of this game didn't get too preachy about eating right. They didn't make fruits and vegetables superior to the other groups and that's a good thing. It all comes together at the end with Sam's lesson even though the game as a whole seems scattered and jumbled.If you liked the first two games then it's your duty to give this one a try. It's good, but not memorable. Not like the first two. Also, the end credits grace us with some rather interesting pictures. It's the 21st century and Pajama Sam offers a particularly eye-opening photo with our favorite orange friend. It made me tip a hat to the game makers. I never realized how progressive these games were until I became an adult.Well done."

Each of the four main Humungous Entertainment franchises is aimed at a slightly different narrow age bracket - kids grow up so fast, after all. Putt-Putt is the youngest - essentially games about a bunch of living toys, be they vehicles, aliens or animals - and next is Freddi Fish, essentially a serties of interactive direct-to-video movies. Skipping ahead, Spy Fox is for kids old enough to know what it's parodying through pop-culture osmosis. And in between, when kids are just starting to wise up to things, is the Blue Calvin himself, Pajama Sam. But given how his personality has been tweaked relative to Calvin's, it would be better to say that this game is FOR Calvin. This game has real wits and brains behind it - not surprising, given that Ron Gilbert was behind it. This is one of those few works enjoyed by kids and adults for exactly the same reasons."

Unlike in the previous two games, Sam isn't over coming any fears in this game, instead it's about preventing war and learning about the food groups as he progresses his mission. The story is just as inventive as the previous installments and the characters and jokes once again are clever and well thought out. If you love the last two Pajama Sam games, then you can't go wrong with this one."

You Are What You Eat is encourages you to scan enviroments for items and utilize your imagination in solving problems.The game is effectively an interactive cartoon in which the plotline is basically about talking food attending a Peace Conference in their equivelant of the United Nations. Nearly everything in the background is interactive, with neat and somewhat trippy little animations hidden amongst bushes and behind signs."

Taking into account the age of the game, the visuals still hold up to today's standards. The combination of the visuals, story, and voice acting all add up to the overall charm of the game. Pajama Sam is a great series for point-and-click enthusiasts, and for casual gamers alike."

My friend thinks I'm stupid for buying this game but I don't care. I know there is a more pajama sam game that I hope to play soon. I kinda wanted to play this game when I was younger. Overall it's a neat game.

It has comedy, it has tragedy, it has puzzles, it has skiing minigames. PS3: YAWYEFYHTYF offers all of the benefits of tactical role playing game, without all the fuss. Humungous Entertainment has proven their mastery of turn-based combat and any fan of series such as Tales, Shim Megami Tensei, Final Fantasy, or the Xeno series, ought to add this to their wish list and maybe even pick up the whole collection on sale.I cannot recommend you start with PS3: YAWYEFYHTYF, since PS: TNNTHWIDO has some required backstory for understanding the nuances of Sam's excursion inside of his pantry. Any reader of Marx or Engels should pick this game up. Think you know Friedrich Nietzsche, think again."
