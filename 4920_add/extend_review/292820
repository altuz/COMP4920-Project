,Not Recommended,292820,11093087,"Posted: 5 July, 2014",all,ConanHuynh,"This game is not too shabby, good even.Pajama Man's show just ended. Sam is about to turn of the television until he sees the credits - an autograph from Pajama Man himself at the mall! Joyous, Sam asks his mom if he can go, and she says yes, telling him to bring something to sign for his favorite hero. He finds a special edition comic book after a brief search. As Sam reaches for the comic book, it is sucked down in a pile. Pajama Sam dives in to retrieve back his possession. That's where the adventure begins.As the fourth installment in the series, people expect the game to live up to its reputation. Does it? Not quite.-The voice actor for Pajama Sam contrasts its predecessors. Once you hear a voice that sticks out, it's memorable. Fortunately for us, we all loved the original voice actor. Although this one shows satisfactory, it's just not up to par.-I don't know about anyone else, but the game is choppy when I move from map to map. This diminishes the overall fluidity of the game.-Collecting items. In Pajama Sam One, you collected socks. Pajama Sam Two, puzzle pieces. Three, box tops. Here, you collect these trading cards. These aren't bad. I actually like them. It's just the AMOUNT you have to collect. Essentially every place you go to has a card lying around. Like with the mini glitches stated in the previous statement, the collection of trading card simply reduces the flow of movement.-There aren't many objects you can click on anymore, and if you do, it's passable. One of the things I clicked on was some kind of poster in the first map of the main game. When I did, it just changed. No movement. No animation. Nothing. As a child, I loved looking at everything popping out of the screen. Don't get me wrong, there are some good ones out there. Just not as much.-This is a little detail, but saving the game bugs me. With the other Pajama Sam adventures, you saved and went about with your business. Now, we have Sam telling us what to do. At first, it was charming. Then, it turned annoying real soon.-The game in general doesn't make sense. In the previous three games, they all had a theme, and they all logically made sense. In No Need to Hide When It's Dark Outside, it was about darkness. In Thunder and Lightning Aren't so Frightening, it was about weather. In You Are What You Eat From Your Head to Your Feet, it was about food. In Life Is Rough When You Lose Your Stuff, it was about...well, stuff. Why do we need a shirt, some socks, and some shoes to meet Pajama Man?-Back to the previous thought, a lot of the characters contribute little to the theme. I felt they were placed there just for show instead of adding value. They did little to push the game in the right direction.Okay, so aside from all the substandard effort put forth, some good came out.-The different pathways continued in this game. This is a point-and-click adventure, and I welcomed exploring the various routes.-I liked the ""Part Two"" side of this game. It's in the Freddi Fish and SPY Fox series. In the Freddi Fish and SPY Fox games, once you were done with your main objective, there was a little more you needed to do in order to fix the problem. In this Pajama Sam game, you experienced a little of that magic in this game.-Probably the idea I liked most was you can try more items to other items. Before, in the other games, if something didn't work, Sam would say ""That's not going to help"" or ""I don't think that's going to do me any good."" Now, you can do some trial and error. I won't try to spoil too much, but there's one part with fireflies. I tried catching them with a jar, but they wouldn't be able to breathe. I tried catching them with a net, but they were too small. The options available allowed me to think, and I enjoyed the puzzle-solving.As a whole, Life Is Rough When You Lose Your Stuff is not a bad game. It's a charming, fun game with interesting characters, designs, and effects. With that being said, its performance compared to its older installments puts the Pajama Sam series to shame. This is a fantastic game for those who never received a chance to play with any of the Humongous Entertainment games, but for veteran players such as myself, this game will dust in my Steam library."

As a childhood fan of all of the Humongous games (Freddie Fish, Spy Fox, etc.), I wish this game wasn't created just as much as I wish Indiana Jones 4 wasn't created. The lip syncing is horrendous, the movement from map to map is terrible, you can't end scenes whenever you want and the beginning of the game leads off with a super long song. All of the voices sound like someone made it in their basement and all of the characters you run into are uninteresting. Pajama Sam doesn't have the same voice and neither the actress who plays him or the script written for him is able to capture his personality at all.I'm going to pretend this game never happened..."

What they did with these changes is what let me down. When I played through the past three games, they each had a flowing and organic theme to them. One that kids could relate to and it felt like an experience and achievement. There was great care taken into the details, voice work, the style. Even the musical placement. I did not, however, get the same feeling from this game. It felt like a game that was constructed by a paint by numbers manual. A song goes here, a puzzle goes there, hey this voice is silly- throw it here. I'm not angry...Just very disappointed. I looked forward to playing another sequel of the little boy named Pajama Sam. The one who ""Always helps those in need"". Their heart wasn't in the creation of this game, and mine wasn't in it when I tried to play it."
,Not Recommended,292820,23573331,"Posted: 15 June, 2016",all,Double Uppercut,"Well, we're finally here at the end of the road. I've gone back and played the original HE Pajama Sam trilogy from my childhood, and now it's finally time to see how Atari finished off the series with the conclusive Pajama Sam 4!And, I've gotta say, at the end of this long road... the destination sucks!I've played all of the Pajama Sam original three games, so all it took for me to review them was to just simply play them as a fully-grown adult, and compare them to the sandard I now hold to video games. But I never knew there was a Pajama Sam 4. It just silently exists. Like a foul turd at the bottom of a toilet from your friend failing to remember how to flush.Pajama Sam 4 continues the story of Pajama Sam learning important values as a child, when he's about to go see Pajama Man at the mall, and loses his comic in his messy closet. He then enters a world of lost objects and assorted trash to find his comic and... ugh... I don't care. I really don't care.I've never been so apathetic about Sam in a plot before. Even with my least favorite game in the original trilogy, Pajama Sam 2, there was still some drive. You had to fix the weather machine and save the world! How cool is that? And Pajama Sam 1 and 3 had the drive of you overcoming greediness and the fear of the dark. Both of which were subtly laid out and never preached to you.I don't care about getting the comic book mainly because it's too tied up in Sam's mundane child life. The first three games felt like you were solving problems within Sam's massive imagination, and while that feeling is still here in Pajama Sam 4, the goal is too close to something so dull and uninteresting, that I legitimately don't care about it.It also doesn't help that the world you travel in is one of the most vapid, boring worlds in the HE games library. Everything is just various shades of turquois and purple. with no variety thrown in. The first three games had some fantastic color palettes that didn't just stick to two colors. They used different shades of all the colors that complemented blue and purple. This world feels disgusting, bland, and ultimately unimaginative.And I do mean disgusting. There are some gross animations, like watching a sponge eat mold off a horn, seeing a pizza turn black and sink into a sidewalk, and watching a pig greedily chew on a meal in a greasy diner. It's just an unpleasant world, as well as bland.The plot in Pajama Sam 4 is incredibly stupid, and relies to heavily on a gag to give you any drive to succeed. You need to get a shirt, some socks, and some shoes in order to enter the garbage mall, see Dr. Grime (who you never actually meet), and get your comic book back. Yes, it follows that Humongous formula, but the mystery of seeing Dr. Grime is spoiled, when the garbage children mistaker Sam for Dr. Grime because he's so dirty. He looks nothing like Dr. Grime! Can you be that stupid?And at the end, Sam cleans up the garbage mall and makes a speech about how he should take care of his stuff and make sure to stay clean. I would've been fine with this if there were no speech, since everything you did already contributed to the message (kind of like the last three games. Huh.), and you didn't have the point of the story spelled out for you. That and most of the characters are too incompetent and lazy to take care of their problems and rely on a 7-10 year old to fix it for them. That was very irritating. I think only two characters go out of their way to help you: the scuba diver and the sponge. That's it.Technically speaking, there are some things that are just okay in the game and things I abominate. I like the music. It's actually pretty decent. There's some singers that'll hum or snap their fingers while you traverse the world, giving it a more charming feel than it actually is. I like the character animation and graphics now. They look actually hand-drawn and animate the same way, too. It looks nice.However, these features are blown out of the water by the terrible voice dubbing. The characters don't even match what they're actually saying half the time! I also hate how little animation there is in the world. It doesn't feel living. And that could be because I played Spy Fox 3 not too long ago, and a lot of the backgrounds were fully animated, but that game was made 2 whole years before Pajama Sam 4! Shame on you, Atari.While the animation is fine, there's a constant framerate lag for each screen. On a cartoon point-and-click game made in 2003. It's not enough to be a massive problem, but it's incredibly annoying when you have to wait for the game to catch up with where you are. Pajama Sam will walk from one side of the screen to the next, but will stop halfway for about five seconds, and then pop into the new area halfway into it already. Every time. I thought this was just my copy, but on the walkthroughts I watched, it seems to be the same case. This game runs like thick sh**.Along with that, once you've played the game once, that's it. There aren't anymore variations. I attempted a second playthrough, but everything was exactly the same. I think the only thing that changes locations are the trading cards you can find (which is expected), and... wait for it.... are you ready?... this is gonna blow your mind!... a jar. A motherf***ing jar. That's it. There are arcade games you can play, but they perform just as laggy as everything else that I have no motivation whatsoever to coninue playing them.Of course the final nail in the coffin is the horrendous voice acting. Sam has a totally new voice, and I wouldn't mind it so much, if she didn't emote like a wacky kid from the 90's. ""Whoooaaah!"", ""Yippee!"", and ""Alllllright!"" come out so many times, that it makes me physically cringe to hear her force those uncomfortable phrases. Most of the other voice actors are so stiff and dry, that it sounds like they're reading off their script in front of the mic, and only slightly adding an accent to it. Terrible all around.Pajama Sam 4, while it is the final Pajama Sam game, is by far the worst. It's clear that Atari didn't know how to make a Pajama Sam game and just feebly attempted to do what they thought make a good kids game from the established formula, but they failed so horribly on every level, that I can consider this one of the worst games I've played on my library. I'm giving Pajama Sam a 1/10. Despite the nice new animation and music, this game is one of the worst Humongous titles, as well as one of the worst games I've had to suffer through. My advice: just play the first three. I may not have enjoyed Pajama Sam 2 that much, but it's better than this hunking pile of sh**."

One of these things is Sam should sound right (voiced by Pamela Adlon) but for whatever reason Pajama Sam is voiced now by Elisha Ferguson. This is extremely disorienting. Ruin the game disorienting. Elisha Ferguson makes Sam sound very feminine, enough that Megan and I started referring to ""her"" as Pajama Samantha. PJ Sam 4 also has less things to click on, like in old PJ Sam games you could click a leaf and it would transform into a flower (or whatever) , this generally doesn't happen in PJ Sam 4. The collectibles (trading cards) are kinda cool thoughCurrently taking around 2-3 hours for two late teens to finish so it would be even longer for young kids.As a game by itself it's an OK point and click kids game. As a Pajama Sam game it's not good. At all.VIDEO"

This was the only Pajama Sam game in the series that I owened and played as a child, so I can't relate when people claim that this game ""Kills the nostalgia"" because to me, this game IS my nostalgia. However, I cannot disagree when people mention the poor audio synch up with the movement of characters mouths. It's definitely not the greatest. But, I was never bothered by this issue as a kid, and I doubt any other child playing this game would mind either.I like this game, it makes me happy, and I have no doubt in my mind that the other three Pajama Sam games will make me just as happy."

,Recommended,292820,22906581,"Posted: 10 May, 2016",all,ryoukemeiun,"I recommend this game, but that's because I love the series a lot. As other players have noted, yes, the original voice actress  does not voice Sam, so he has a noticeably difference voice. It's a bit of a jarring change. I can ignore it, but I know it may bother others. Overall, the art style and music is different (which kind of makes sense given the time gap between this game and the third), which isn't necessarily awful by itself, but both seem less zany than the previous games. Upsettingly, the dialogue isn't as fun or quirky as the last few games either, and the voice delivery is as flat as the dialogue.On a technical level, this Steam version, for me, had very laggy cutscenes where the audio would occasionally cut out for some lines. I own this on the original CD too, and I nevwr had such problems. Additionally, the gameplay is also way laggier (even on aforementioned CD). When moving from A to B, the screen pauses with an image of Sam exiting before popping over to the new screen instead of smooth transitions seen in other Humongous Entertainment games. Even the speaking in non-cutscenes is laggy.I think the plot still fits with the general feel of the Pajama Sam series (the end progression is weird, though), and I like the trading card system (because I'm also a giant nerd for cards), but the different execution makes the game feel very, very different from its predecessors and not in the best way. It's a love-hate relationship, I guess. Also, the drawer game is stupidly easy. Like, what? And the Bejeweled game also feels laggy as hell. Sigh.TL;DR: I recommend the game because I like the series, but it is VERY different from the other Pajama Sam games. Kind of flat and lackluster, but not terrible. There are lag issues, however, that are really annoying no matter how you look at it."

The voice acting isn't all that great.

But I completely disagree on that remark as this game is just as enjoyable as the previous three installments. In the fourth and final game, Sam (who isn't voiced by Pamela Adlon) learns that Pajama Man(which is actually a guy in a mascot costume) is giving out autographs at the local mall. Sam knows that his first issue of Pajama Man comic series is the prefect item to get signed. Only problem is that his room is a mess and couldn't find it. So once again he imagines that he ""visits"" a ficitional land. In this case it's a junk land where Sam encounters all sorts of characters and creatures. The thing I love about this game is that it explores the Pajama Man series more with the info of the characters on the trading cards you collect throughout the game. A lot of the cards reference characters and items mentioned by Sam in the previous installments. Which gives the Pajama Man character a sense of history to him. Overrall this game isn't as bad as people claim it to be, plus it be a bit hard to come up with newer ideas had this series went on longer. So the idea of exploring the Pajama Man universe and backstories is a logical choice to conclude this franchise. If you loved the first three games, give this one a chance cause it's far from being bad or boring."

But I would recomend this fun and challenging adventure game to basically anyone."

This installment, helmed by Atari after their purchase of the company, sometimes manages to have dialogue that can be funny, but fails in every other aspect.I don't need to be one of the many people who has blasted the voice-acting of this game, however, after playing this game and attempting to play it again for the sake of review, I would fell empty to not mention how horrible this voice acting is. Sam sounds far too young, and barely has much power behind his voice. He is far from the only one with bad vocie acting, among a slew of obnoxious characters even small children could easily find annoying.The plot for Pajama Sam games where usually easy accuses that make sense, yet this one somehow messes that up. It makes no sense and feels rushed, and the game itself is littered with not just confusing choices, but bugs. My second try end only ten minutes in after a bug broke the mouse. I do not understand how a point-and-click adventure game can make the mouse stop working, and yet that's exactly what happened with this game.Life Is Rough When You Lose Your Stuff is a buggy and annoying mess that should not be played. Do not buy this game for your children, and do not believe that it is good simply because of the previous installments, which thankfully hold up incredibly well."

Everything feels less whimsical because of it. I also had a problem with moving between locations, which I didn't have with the other three games in the series. It just feels like this last installment didn't get the love and attention our hero deserves.I mean, it's not unplayable, but... it's not as good as the other games in the series."

Was going to place this in my library of discarded titles in all likelyhood but would had liked to at least check what it was about since this seems to be more of a point&click than one of those annoying minigame titles and might have had potential. Oh well...
