Story is cute - Robin is actually a GIRL so she can get away with more because all the guards are searching for a man. Though there are wanted adds all over for her (guess the guards are oblivious to those) so, in addition to the HO scenes, you're looking around for those wanted posters and ripping them up. :D As she recruits her merry men, she gains skills from them. Is that boulder too heavy to lift? Ask Little John to help. Need something pick pocketed? Call on Will Scarlet. And, of course, she has her own arrow abilities! There are also archery tournaments that test your mouse aiming skills. I normally dislike those kinds of things but, in this case, I found myself enjoying them and entering every competition I could. Regardless of all my good words, wait for a sale if you're interested in a purchase. It's a fairly short game, with no achievements or cards. And it's not ""connected"" to steam so no chatting with friends or pic taking while playing. I also found that every time I exited the game, steam would show it was still running so that was kind of a pain. But considering all the stinker HOs out there, I was pleasantly surprised by this gem. Hidden Object and Robin Hood fans should give this a try!"

If you are an adult who enjoys hidden objects games, you will find no challenge in either the puzzles or the archery mini game.  That aside, for children of ages 7 to 13, this is a pretty cute game.  The protagonist is a female and the story is set in the Middle Ages and draws on some of the Robin Hood lore, so it has appeal for both boys and girls."

This is a 'hunt the object' game rather than the point and click adventure I was hoping for. Linear and full of hints. Its cheap enough but some older titles which have been reduced will have much more gameplay than this one.
,Recommended,292880,21690539,"Posted: 7 March, 2016",all,TheMummy17,"This game is a Hidden Object game along with a few puzzles. The game is done well, the graphics match the story and are pleasent to the eye. The gameplay and interface seem to work pretty well no real complaints there either. However, once I got going into the game it's clear that the game is designed for children 12 and under. The HOG were pretty simple and short and the puzzles were all very easy, probably except one and that was more time consuming then hard. If you have children under 12 it is highly recommended. It's a fun diversion for adults without much pressure involved if you really need to play a Robin Hood game.  My time in the game is five hours but had quite a bit of AFK time there. This is probably finishable in 2 hours, 3 tops. Give it a total thumbs up for children though and give it a rating of 7 for them."

But it has some nice features compared to other hidden object games, like party members with special abilities and optional side quests. Plus you get more than one useful item from hidden object scene, instead of being sent back to the same scenes multiple times to needlessly pad the game. The voice acting and BGM aren't bad, either."

It's just a little too short, there are too many segments in which the next step is utterly obscure (with little or no help from the hints), and the kid-friendly setting and story, while nice enough, are lacking in atmosphere and suspense. There are also very few actual puzzles, so progression and hidden object are the main challenges. Still, the gameplay has plenty of welcome flourishes for those craving something a little fresher."
,Recommended,292880,15898789,"Posted: 19 May, 2015",all,HimeJezabel,"Cute game, with children as target audience. It's colourful, easy and has a happy-go-lucky feel to it.The first person is Robin Hood, a young woman who was imprisoned with her husband. She has to escape the prison, help the town citizens with their problems (mostly getting their gold/items back from mean leaders), gather up her merry men by collecting their pardons so they are free to roam the town, free her husband and confront the evil Prince John.There is a lot of backtracking as you unlock companions with abilities as you progress and so have to go back to use them. There is a map, but it's completely useless and does not tell which areas are completed nor can it be used for teleporting.The areas themselves have an Area Cleared sign when it has been cleared.The game mostly has a Robin Hood-era feel to it with items and music, but some wtf-things stood out. Yin yang and statue of Vishnu? Really?Both the hidden object games and the other mini-games are really simple, the archery contest adds a little to the game, though this also is fairly easy. You have 5 hints available, in the form of a jar of fireflies, and should you use all of them, you can wander around collecting more fireflies to get more hints. Hints can be used both in puzzles and to figure out in which direction you need to go next.Good game for children as a sort of introduction to both Robin Hood and HOGs. Might be worth its full price for children, but adults will want this on sale as it gets too easy."

Finished in 2 hours but it was very entertaining nonetheless. Don't let the fact it's based on the legend of Robin Hood put you off, it changes enough of the story to make it fun and the gameplay and mini game elements more than make up for it. As well as the story to follow, you have collectables to find, gold caches to discover and archery competitions to win. If you are a HO fan, you'll like this one."
,Recommended,292880,22793587,"Posted: 4 May, 2016",all,Bassem,"A fun, easy, high-quality HOG & AG, if you're willing to play windowedThis is one of the best AG/HOG (point & click Adventure Game / Hidden Object Game) hybrids I've played.What I enjoyedThe HO scenes are well laid out, with no cheap tricks or obstructions. A bit on the easy side, but at least not frustrating.As a female take on Robin Hood, you recruit the famous members of the Merry Men gang by helping them win pardons, in return for their skills as contextual abilities.Great voice acting, especially on the main character Robin.Art is pretty good, and the UI is polished with excellent user experience.Side objectives like collectibles.Optional side games (archery competition) to offer a break from the quests. Because there's quests.The game helpfully marks a scene as ""area clear"" when you've solved all puzzles and found all secrets in it. If it hasn't, you're missing something.What I didn't likeLow resolution (garbled, blurry if played fullscreen).4:3 screen. Making it fullscreen on a widescreen monitor will stretch the game horizontally rather than add black bars, distorting everything.I didn't find much difference between Casual and Advanced modes of difficulty.The archery side game is just one stage that's repeated in all the ""competitions"".Having to play it windowed makes the objects in HO scenes harder to find.All in all an excellent little HOG/adventure mix. About 4.5 hours worth of play. For the asking price, definitely recommended."

The hidden object aspects were pretty good and having the different skills of the merry men to use to figure out the puzzles were fun. I think the best ultilization of this aspect was towards the end when you rescued Robin's husband. I wish that technique was used a lot more often. Otherwise, the only times i needed th hint system was to clean each area by finding the hidden gold. The fact that it told you when each area/screen was clear was helpful too because then it make  it easier to figure out where you were meant to go next. Overall, a short but interesting experiance.

I will try to give it a neutral review.Pro:Nice voiceacting.Changed story gives an interesting backdrop of an old myth and legend.Con:Dated graphics, still look nice. But - look at some of the screenshots.Some things within the story and the game give the impression of superficiality, which isn't really making the game a better one.Bumpy gameplay, as if the coding is flawed and therefore failing.Recommended with strong reservations.The game can be worthwhile if you like genderbendered heroes.

Mostly the former.  I would recommend it for little kids or intellectually challenged adults, except for the 2 or 3 stupidly hard puzzles.  There aren't many and you can ""autosolve"" them after a short period of time, but overall the game is just not worth the SMALL amount of time it takes to get through it.Some of the puzzles were solved just by clicking around randomly.  Even after solving such a puzzle, it isn't necessarily very clear WHY it is now solved.  The hidden objects are sometimes incorrectly named - such as when you are supposed to find ""gold discs"" that are ACTUALLY gold CIRCLETS.  NOT THE SAME THING AT ALL.  And most of the puzzles where you have to place gears and such just auto-place them FOR you and the puzzle is magically solved.  Not all, but the majority of that type of puzzle.PASS on this game.NOT SUITABLE for adults.NOT SUITABLE for kids.ZERO replayabilityAnd the real killer - no fun."

The story is light-hearted and fun, and you feel like the missions and objects you're finding actually have a purpose (unlike many HOGs). At $4.99 it's a good value, but it is a pretty quick play (2-3 hrs) so maybe wait for it to go on sale.

The search for the pieces of paper can be confusing at times as sometimes it is in front of you and you don't see itThis is a good game and you have all the characters like Little john and the robe wearer john who is persuasvie which is good and nice intereactions. I am only half way in the game and can take time to do it and feel engaged. It is on special for $1.49 and worth the money spent while on special.I finished it today and the puzzles were nice and it seems you are playing as the mother of Robin hood and you meet a young Marion, who would be older than Robin.

I didn't have to search up a walkthrough to figure out if I was missing anything when I got stuck - Robin's own inner commentary provides clues on what you're supposed to do.It is a great game to introduce kids to the HOG adventure type games - I created a new profile for my 12yr old.
