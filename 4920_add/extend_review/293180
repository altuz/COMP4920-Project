The game is too short. But, it can be depressive and scary sometimes.But, unlike some other indie FPS games that were made in some ""make-your-own-fps-in-5-minutes-or-less-game-creator"", I get the feeling that these two guys that made this game (if I am correct) actually tried their best. And for that, I give them thumbs up.Plus, it's a cheap game."
,Not Recommended,293180,22877226,"Posted: 9 May, 2016",all,Faudraline,"Overcast - Walden and the Werewolfis a FPS horror game, coming from the indie developer, Microblast Games. It was the first of Microblast titles that I've tried and I'm more than positive that it's gonna be the last of their titles that I'll ever be playing. At this point, we are used to indie horror games with poor environment design, broken or nonexistent stories and grindy rendering but this game takes the badly done horror game concept to a new level.From the tedious scraps of unhinged narrative, I'll try to present a baseline for the story. In a somewhat western setting, we have an old and bitter hunter called Walden living alone near the Ravin Town. Supposedly, he's been to a shooting years ago and lost so much blood, that it was a miracle for him to be alive to begin with. After the incident, Walden locks himself into his cabin, never to interact with the people of Ravin Town for years. On a fateful day, he leaves the cabin and notices an unholy darkness covering the area. He takes his gun and decides to investigate, only to discover the townsfolk to be butchered and the town itself in ruins. Thus, his journey to take revenge for people he has never interacted with begins.Graphics give you the feeling that this game should be hailing from 90s, not only 2 years ago. Objects are riddled with odd texture bugs and the environment design is tediously repetitive. Camera view is either too dark to see anything or all infested by blasting neon colors of blurry visuals as if Walden is in a bad LSD trip. There are no character animations in the cinematics; only close up recordings of character models in obscure positions, standing solid in really weird poses. They are quite spastic. I think the developer had no idea how to animate to begin with, so tried to sell this piece as an artistic choice.There is no voice acting at all. You are presented bits of narrative in between chapters, and the narrative is not only riddled with grammatical errors: it is horridly bad and meaningless. No definitive storytelling, no cause-consequence relation, no logical dramatic arrangement. Only over dramatic statements with absurdly empty undertone thrown around.  The setting itself isn't consistently logical to begin with. You'll go through your village, a mountain highway, an abandoned ship (?), a dungeon (wtf???) and a cemetery without meaningful story arrangement for any of these places. And that ending... well, you gotta love last minute enforced plot hooks and this one takes the cake with those! I literally fell out of my chair laughing the minute I heard the name of the main villain.Game dynamic itself is so badly broken, with no tension build up necessary for proper horror at all. You stumble upon jump scares every 3 minutes - consisting of either obscurely rendered close ups of monsters or some graphic images in negatives. All of those jump scares come up with ear♥♥♥♥♥♥caliber sound effects though, which is straight annoying. You run around with a mini-map directing you towards the next mission and either grab keys or shoot at some nugatory monsters. Walden's gun is probably the most useless weapon in video game history, by the way. It is a rifle - which Walden carries like a pistol - that takes 8 seconds to load. This is somewhat alright if you are facing a single monster but it becomes hellishly useless when hordes of monsters are running after you in the following chapters. Considering you have no sprint option; you run around, fire and run around some more while you wait for the gun to reload and repeat. That is all you can actually do in this game.Is it scary? Nah, it's so bad that it kinda ends up being good. That's why I completed the game to begin with. I was amazed at every little thing that I've stumbled upon, getting curious how worse it could become by the end. Atmosphere-wise, the soundtrack is the only good thing about this game. Consider yourself buying a music CD for a dollar. So it's good purchase in the end.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

I'm not sure how to describe it, so I'll tell you about the first bits of 'gameplay'. Together with the low price, the 'mixed' reviews and the screenshots on the store page, you'll be able to decide whetherOvercast - Walden and the Werewolfis for you.It starts out as a walking simulator, pure and simple. The only element that's added is that often, random things are in your way and you need to right-click them and drag them away so you can pass. Sounds a bit like a chore, doesn't it? Well, that's how it feels, too.From time to time, your screen gets jumbled or bombarded with seemingly random graphics, accompanied by loud sound effects. Yeah, jump scares, but strange ones at that because they are completely unrelated to what's happening around you.After a bit of that and another chore that consists of you dragging items around yet again, you're attacked by an illusion: a snake head that manifests itself in a green misty cloud and chases you. If it catches you, it's game over. Shooting at it has no effect at all, of course, but I thought it was worth a try. Running around for a couple of minutes didn't end the scene (if the solution is to run in circles for 15 minutes or so, I'll pass, thank you very much) and you can't leave the area (you get a message saying so if you try to leave). After a couple of tries, each time having to do the chore all over again first, I didn't feel any urge to try again.Overcast - Walden and the Werewolfmay basically be a 'game' in the sense that it has the technical requirements like graphics, sound and controls that allow you to move the camera, but the developers obviously forgot that a computer program needs to be more than that to be called a game. To keep it short: it should at least offer a bit of fun and it should create the illusion of purpose and accomplishment. You can't just slap together some code and call it a game. Well, these days on Steam, you can, but you get my drift.In the end,Overcast - Walden and the Werewolfreminded me of the following scene from The Simpsons.Principal SkinnerOh, licking envelopes can be fun! All you have to do is make a game of it.Bart SimpsonWhat kind of game?SkinnerWell, for example, you could see how many you could lick in an hour, then try to break that record.BartSounds like a pretty crappy game to me.SkinnerYes, well...

And maybe slightly improve the game's ending. Was about to say ""and combat""... but no, it's rather a little psichological challenge as it is(not too hard once you know how to act) and makes a significant part of what makes sense in this game.]Honestly, taking into account that it's a one dev's work, and, i presume, the first one of his, i'd like to give this game a thumbs up. But feels like it just wouldn't be right, and not recommending it is sure to save many players from dissapointment and the dev himself from offensive comments.Though i can recommend it to those who like getting themselves in some new surroundings to walk through another short and primitive story and have little care for how bad them both were thought out. You'd even find a little pretty scenery(if you like that kind of it), slightly scary for noobs visual and sound effects, nice music and maybe a couple of other good things. But it won't add enough to make the whole game damn good. Can't say i'm totally dissapointed but looks like screenshots and description on the steam store leave much better impression than the game itself. And everything that was relatively to my liking in this game was also getting heavily damaged all the way by the boring combat(which looks a little better if you view it as a check-up of your nerve and gets easier than it initially seems to be), and almost killed by the ending which was either(i'm sorry, mr developer) stupid or far beyond the limits of my ability to perceive why the hell it had to be ended that way, looking like a text description of a bad movie's promice to be continued(i'd even speculate that's what it is or once had to be).There was a slight hope for an alternate course of the game story, (here goes a spoiler on a game story event):screaming woman, found dead in my playthroughwhich i don't believe in and don't feel like wanna check it right away i finish typing this.

,Recommended,293180,20367271,"Posted: 6 January, 2016",all,HumanWreckage,"SO.. Where do I start?  I had to make a transaction to sell some uneeded stuff over the steam marketplace so I literally looked for the cheapest game that I thought I may could put up with one day and found Overcast - Walden and the werewolf for $0.14..Overcast - Walden and the werewolf is a physiological horror game that eats at you with the erie atmosphere not knowing when, where, or what may pop out.  In between every chapter you get cinematic cutscenes that fill in the story piece by piece.  The cutscenes have heroic music behind them and subtitles telling the story.  You have 9 chapters of story to complete which can be completely within a couple of hours at most.This is a FPS.  In the left hand you have a lantern, the right you have your handy rifle.  You only get one gun.  One bullet and then you have to reload everytime.  Only a couple of keys to control the whole game while having the ""hand"" cursor the same as Penumbra or Amnesia games to grab and move objects around.While being a huge horror movie and game fan I adore this game for what it tries to do.  The graphics are dated and are not pretty as the games today but Overcast proves you can still scare the sh*t out of people without modern graphics.  Now for graphics this games graphics are pretty plain.  Very grainy style graphics that makes it hard to see anywhere far from you.  BUT.  I've seen people get scared and jump at a lot less than this.  But there are a couple of times in the game that I can imagine some people may get freaked out or even jump at.Gameplay was pretty smooth for me but I did encounter a bug two times during the final boss fight that I guess kept the fight going and somehow I randomly died both times?  After one final attempt before shutting the game off for the night, randomly with me expecting more fight the game ended!The combat in the game was very boring in my opinion.  It gives you a gun that has one shot, takes forever to reload and makes you back up - shoot - reload during every fight.  I can understand that this machinism is designed to implant fear or panic but in my case it just annoyed me to no end making things feel very drawn out.I was not a big fan of the story, but to me it was more of a game with a ""base"" story that thrown me in the game to play.  The heroic music in each cinematic cutscene made me feel like a badass and even in some combat the music gave me hope!Bottom line:  For under a dollar if you are a horror fan looking for something to occupy your time for a couple hours, maybe give you a couple jump scares than pick this up.  I do recommend this game because besides the final fight I had no problems running or playing this game.  It has a story, it was in 3d, and could get a couple good jumps out of some people.  That is my $0.14 cents worth people :)"

76561198196490709,Not Recommended,293180,22056718,"Posted: 25 March, 2016",all,Ithaqua,"Warning, possible spoilers below.I'll start with the good things about this game, as I can tell the developer put some sort of effort into it. The music was really nice, it actually helped provide a creepy atmosphere for at least the first 3 or 4 levels, I don't know if it continued as I gave up upon seeing the werewolf for the first time and realizing that the gameplay doesn't improve in the slightest.Now for the bad. First point: Gameplay. I like a good story, but even more important is the gameplay, how you interact with the world and it's creatures. The gameplay here consists of move objects, fire one shot every ten seconds or so if you're in combat, strafe at a ridiculously slow pace against enemies that move slightly faster than you, and walk along a very linear path while enjoying acid flashbacks that will hurt your eyes.Second point: The story. It's not that bad honestly, but it doesn't really make up for the terrible gameplay which is what I was hoping for. I can pull through a rubbish game if I enjoy the story it's telling me, or vice versa but here I got nothing. No voice acting, which was fine as it's clearly low budget and bad voice acting ruins games for me nearly every time. So you learn the story from the little subtitled bits that appear in between chapters. Not a problem here, I love subtitles as I often miss things without them. However, I do like it when things are spelled correctly and the overall story makes sense. The biggest sin is that it tells you things that just happened, or puts you in danger then solves the problem for you in the next sentence. Perhaps it improves as you go along.Third point: The visuals. No, I don't mean the graphics. I've been gaming since the late 90's, graphics are not what I look for in a game and here they're servicable. When you can see anything, that is. The game is so bloody dark I couldn't see more than 4 feet in front of me. This actually added a bit to the atmosphere, but at the cost of frustrating me to the point where I very nearly gave up on the prologue. Also, the acid flashbacks I mentioned earlier. They were just unpleasant, broke immersion, hurt my eyes, and actually made some of the jumpscares less effective.Fourth point: Jumpscares. I'm a naturally nervous guy, I startle very easily. Thankfully the jumpscares here were weak enough to provide just the right amount of tension for the first few chapters. They come very often though, so it gets a bit repetitive. Nearly♥♥♥♥♥♥myself at the start of whatever chapter it is when you see the werewolf for the first time though.Overall, I bought it for 54 cents Canadian and got roughly half an hour of semi-enjoyment out of it. Not bad really, but I could've put the money to better use. If it's dirt cheap because it's on sale or you've got a coupon and some money to burn, go for it. Otherwise, just watch The Fragnostic's video for it. I got more entertainment from 5 minutes of his video than from playing this game."

I think presentation wise it is a good effort to tell a simple story that half of it is told by just looking at how it plays through with your experiences. I grew up in an age when video games were still a new concept and we didn't have fancy graphics or complex gameplay with our games. But they didn't need to be complex to have the user understand the concept of what is going on and how to operate the game.  Go ahead and try to play a coleco game or a intellivision game. You will see how simplistic games can be enjoyible.The one thing I keep seeing about this game is its visuals . Whooptie big ballzy deal. Not all games are based on graphics. ""Get that out of your head junior"". Story wise I see complaints aswell.  Tbh I like short simple stories and this one told a story and got its point across. ""Maybe junior you need to get more of your edumacation on the understanding of arts""Finally the music was well done for this.  Now sound effects wise some were ok but I will say don't play the game with headphones on at full blast.. Some of the noises will be so overwhelming and loud it will damage something.  I really would like to see this person make a sequel because the end sparked my interest with wanting more.

It's concept and style is one I really like, and I think it had potential. However, it's issues were that it's gunplay was awful as aiming was perfetic with nothing but a slight zoom to increase it. It's story (espcially towards the end) was just senseless and didn't feel like it really cared for itself. The game has an insane amount of blur and film grain, that it is sometimes impossible to see anything. Animations sometimes literally don't happen! And most importantly, it is SO DAMN HARD. Trying to hit anything often fails and reloading is a long pain. The enemies are way to overpowered and kill you in one hit, and they often come in large numbers at high speeds. You'll often be replaying these levels, learning the enemy's attack patterns and spawn areas to get an advantage, which just becomes repetitive.Not to mention, the jumpscares aren't appreciated.However, the game did do somethings right. For example, it's enviroment and artstyle is beautiful. Never have I seen a game create such a vivid and dark world. It's music is very fitting for the story it's telling and it's sounds are outright creepy and well costructed. Level design isn't bad, although not knowing where to go next was a common thing to happen. The game creates a great atmosphere and becomes immensly creepy when it wants to, unfortunately, this is often followed by a terrible, cheap jumpscare. In fact, this game has possibly the worst jumpscares I have ever to experienced. They're just a loud noise with a bright light without warning, and it's scary, yes, but not appreciated. At least  jumpscares from a game like Outlast were well done.So why could I possibly be recommending this game? Well, if you can overlook it's flaws, and yes, that'll be harder than the bloody game itself, but if you can, it is a scary horror game with good pacing, and a brilliant atmosphere. For such a cheap price, I can only recommend this just so you can make your opinion on wether you thought this game was worth 79p.It tries, and does what it can to impress you. It may not be a masterpiece of horror, but it's well worth the GB of hard drive space and your hard-earned 79p."

This game isn't horrible, since I managed to play through it, but the problem is I found myself critsizing and laughing at everything this game threw at me. A horrible attempt at a horror game, you play as Walden, who apparently is void of any sort of emotion and personality until the end. And it's weird since the game gives you his ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story at the beginning and then decides to not build on it at all during the game. So then we have this Werewolf with magic powers destroying things and murdering Walden's entire village (That he didn't live at) for no reason, so Walden has to go find this werewolf, but first he has to do a bunch of things that also have no meaning to the story. Now I'm not going to outright spoil the game, but basically finding keys and killing giant animals (that have no apparent explained connection to the Werewolf) are the majority of objectives for the game. I'm not surprised this game goes on sale for such little prices regularly. I bought it for 19 cents, which I think is appropriate, maybe a bit too cheap, but when I made this review it is now on sale for 29 cents. In the end, this game is absolutely, positively not worth the normal $10 it is priced at.

,Recommended,293180,21364474,"Posted: 21 February, 2016",all,EthanCrambo,"This review contains very few spoilers... I think. :PAlready from the first minute or two of playing this game, there have been a couple of jumpscares. These jumpscares are quite cheap - not screamers, fortunately - but in a sense, these scares are pretty effective for an early development game designer.The graphics of the game are not very appealing, they are very... well just not very good. I have a strong feeling that this game was made using the Unity 3D Engine, due to the scenery. The scenery is also very cheap, but once again - this is a good start for a beginning game designer.I have noticed from the beginning cutscene, there is text dialogue to read at the bottom of the screen. In order to make the game better, I believe that if the creator was to get some voice actors to simply read that dialogue and put it into the game, it would already be so much more effective and intriguing. Perhaps a scratchy voice, considering the character is a hunter.In addition, the cutscene doesn't contain any motion. It contains camera movement, but the characters in the cutscene are standing still and are not moving. Perhaps some rigging and animation could fix this and, once again, effectively make the game better.The game reminds me a little of the Amnesia style. You can pick up and throw (kind of) objects around such as chairs and tables. A hand is shown in the center of the camera view when you look at an object that can be grabbed.The title screen is simply a rifle spinning around in circles, however it still seems pretty effective. There is motion, at least, unlike other indie games' title screens.The jumpscares mainly consist of visual effects and really loud, strange volume. This is quite effective - I almost headbutted my desk.There are notes that can be picked up and read in the game. These are of good style and contain some good information to set the horrific scene of the game. Also, there is lots of blood and gore in this game, but the models used for the humans and the horse are not too exciting. They look like mannequins.There is a map that shows you where to go, which is a decent addition to the game because you have something to show you what you are supposed to do and where you are supposed to go. The jumpscares still happen through the entire game and do make me jump out of my seat.The creator has successfully used the right music to create tension and drama. Music is a very important thing in videogames, for without music there really is no build up in tension.Enemies in the game consist of very basic coding: they follow you and you die if they touch you. This makes the game incredibly easy as far as shooting the enemies, however extremely hard when enemies spawn in opposite locations around you, meaning that if you try to dodge one, another one will be near you and could possibly almost touch you. I actually found the last mission so hard that I was unable to complete it - it just seemed impossible to me. Of course it's not impossible, but after many tries, I had enough.I noticed something strange about the enemies' walking. Sometimes they would collide with an object on the floor or another enemy, which then made them make a swimming motion on the ground. That might need to be looked into.Overall, this game is not the best thing in the world but I would say that if you are the type of gamer that likes indie horror, you should definitely give this game a shot. It does have some potential. :)"

,Recommended,293180,15809032,"Posted: 13 May, 2015",all,CHUU,"Since the dawn of man, all the way back in 1947 with the advent of the first video game, men have stared longingly into their monitors and asked ""What if there's something more to games?"". With a flood of video games in the 70s and 80s, many believed that Western gaming would be forever doomed by shovelware and cheap tie-in software. However, with the fall of the Ataris and Intellivisions came something out of the ashes - a metaphorical phoenix determined to set the world ablaze. Only now, over twenty years after the infamous Video Game Crash, can we finally be witness to the greatest game to ever grace mankind. Spoken of only in legends previously, it is now our greatest honour as a species to play the masterpiece that is ""Overcast - Walden and the Werewolf"".First I would like to discuss the release of this game. Being a long-known legend, it was not simply released to little acclaim one random brisk Friday in April 2014. Walden and the Werewolf was actually found recently by archaeologist in the same spot that the Library of Alexandria burned at. While rummaging through the dirt at the site, a lone individual uncovered a charred, ancient hard drive, with a capacity of only 693MB. After many years of toiling to get it to work with modern computational hardware, the files on the drive were accessed, with only one executable file on the disk. Reading ""JogoHorrívelNaoJogar.exe"" (Portuguese for Walden and the Werewolf), the researcher double clicked the exe file, only to be baffled at what showed up. As soon as the game launched, his eyes were unable to process the glory of what stood in front of him, and he collapsed then and there, only to be found dead by his colleagues hours later. Those same colleagues found nothing on his computer however, for Overcast - Walden and the Werewolf had finally broken free of its physical bonds, and would soon grace the world with its presence for all time. Appearing as nothing more than moving motes of dust on the wind, Walden and the Werewolf managed its way into Valve Headquarters in Bellevue, Washington. Shortly after, it entered Gabe Newell's personal computer, and uploaded itself to Steam without him being any the wiser. A few short minutes later, and Walden and the Werewolf was on the Steam store, listed as being developed and published by Microblast Games. Little did these developers know that this would be the most miraculous event of their video game producing lives, for surely their wallets would soon be unknowingly flowing with dozens, if not hundreds of Brazilian Reals as the masses purchased 'their' game.There is good reason for why Walden and the Werewolf sports an 8.8/10 review by 'Desura' on its Steam page (any points lost must have had to do with the reviewer no longer wanting to live after completing the game, it's just that good!), and it has to do with how amazing the game itself is. On launch, the player will notice they have the option of not one, not two, but nine content-filled levels to choose from, though eight of them are locked away, requiring the player to complete the previous level before advancing. Should one be able to play any level from the get go, they would be too overwhelmed by the magnificence of the later levels to go on living any longer, and so the game slowly ramps up its glory bit by bit, so that the player can develop a sort of tolerance. The first level anyone will play is labelled ""Prologus"", which perfectly describes the challenges that lay before whoever is playing.Upon loading the first board, a faint outline of a house appears in front of the player, shrouded by a fog of static and fog. Approaching the house grants the player the opportunity to see some of the amazing graphics the game has to offer. While some may describe the aesthetic style of the game as ""Play-Doh like"" or ""Awful to the Nth degree"", I must say there is a certain j'est ne sais quoi to the rounded polygons which make up the environment around you. Falling into a trap, the player finds a bolt action rifle in the basement of the house, carried in the right hand from then on. Upstairs are 6 bullets which magically find their way back to you upon completing a stage. Leaving the house, the player finds a rope bridge, destined to bring them to salvation. The wavy nature of the ropes is all but a prophecy of things to come as the player plunges into the icy river below.I could bore you with details of how the later stages play out, but such brilliance must be seen to be believed. Countless ear-wrenching jump scares sure to spook the pants of off you, andstolenhand-crafted physics assets stand between you and completion of the greatest game of all time. Messages like ""You got KEY"" are sure to keep you tantalised for hourson end. Horses, puddles, and fences are sure to bring endless entertainment. Dark Soulsian bosses come about later, testing the endurance of the player as they circle-strafe for minutes at a time, only to perish in a single hit. Character models stuck in the T-pose and Hotline Miami-esque filters grace the player's eyes in cutscenesandgameplay, keeping the atmosphere fresh and alive. What's even better is the green-magenta stereoscopic imagery one will find as they progress which never goes away. Unfortunately I have never beaten Walden and the Werewolf, for I am a lesser man, unfit to complete such a masterpiece. However, I hope all of mankind can experience this wonderful work of art, and for a measly dollar you could almost certainly dobetterworse!Overall, it's alright. A bit boring. But then again so is this review.0/10"

It's not really a plesant jurney...Pros / Cons / Long Version:Pros:The Music is really Awesome!The protagonist, Walden, is a badass that can have his lantern in one hand, his rifle in the other and a table in the... third? ...or maybe with his mind!? How awesome is that!?It also started off rather good setting up a rather scary atmosphere.Even after the first jumpscare it kinda managed to keep the atmosphere going...Flame reflection in the water looks neat!I kinda liked the blurring effects when poisoned and whatnot....oh yea! Did I mention: The Music is really Awesome!Cons:The Filmgrain... it just gotta go!The 'jumpscares'... the first one was a tiny bit scary, but no. It ain't really scary ( shifted to bright backround with 'scary' creatyre and high pitch noice ), the only thing it does is it just rips you out of the immersion of the atmosphere the game seems to be trying to build up.Invisible walls... Come on! There's only plains with grass and dirt as far as the eye can see, why can't I go hiking this way?The non skippable cutscenes when having to run trough a corridor, push a button, wait for cutscene to open door/bars/whatever and then make my way back trough the corridor just to run off into my death and redo the whole chore again... and maybe a few more times...As good as the music may be... the other sound effects doesn't really cut it... it's not horrible, but it aint awesome neither...AI was... well... Charge! ...most of them doesn't do it that fast though, which might be lucky because of:Reloading! ...for... a verry long time. I don't really mind the really long reload time though, but it bugs me out because of the:Animation! Especially the reloading animation, wich during the slowmo sequences is really apparant that it's just a rifle wobbling around in the air. And when it stopps wobbling around and you have it back to your shooting position... you wait for another? ...really long time, before you're actually able to shoot.Oh, yea. More animations! The slow creatures running, leaping or whatever it does... it looks as if it should be getting somewhere, but it's almost standing still...Ok, this aint that big of a deal but: The kinda cool slowly clibing down spiders... that once landed on the gound can't even climb the walls of their own webfilled lair? Just twitching against each other trying to hug the wall waiting for me to shoot them...All the jumping around furniture, barrels, bottles etc that seems to be still when you leave the barn/house/whatever just to start jumping around in there making noices after you've left.The glossiness of some textures is a bit high since if you look at the stairs in an old house you shouldn't be blinded by the glossy wood...Conclusion:The Music is really Awesome!Also it starts out rather good, setting the mood and starting off with the story.But after a couple of jumpdontcares, and what seemed to me like unfair deaths making me redo tedious chores, in the end resulted in a not really that plesant of a jurney...Even though it started out rather good and has potential, in this current state I cannot really reccomend this game."

Really annoying.Dark, grainy graphics could work in this kind of game. I'm okay with that. But too bad everything looks like shiny plastic, including wood, blood, plants etc.First try shortly: After finding a gun, green arrow on yard was calling me. But I wasn't allowed to go there when my weapon was not loaded. (Why there was green glowing arrow there then?) I drop down from bridge and continued walking in water, but after a moment I died. (Apparently I drowned, there just wasn't any indicator of that?)For some reason game continued from other side of bridge even though I didn't reach it. Old locked wooden gate stopped me. Shooting it didn't make any damage. I walked out from the map and collided to invisible wall. When church doors slammed shut, I thought something is finally happening. But no, I just opened the doors and continued. I found key, but it didn't open the locked gate. And I must say that in this point I got a bit bored wandering around in darkness.I got 75% discount, but still this feels a bit waste of money. With a bit better controls, less shinier graphics and especially much less walking around aimlessly, this could be already much better game."

It's yet another shoddy jump scare fest made with Unity by some kid who was hoping to get PewDiePie to make a video about it. There's nothing fun or scary about it, and I wasn't even startled by the jump scares.Most of your time spent playing this is spent looking around in the dark for keys and other small objects. Your lantern is so dim that you can barely see anything more than five feet in front of you, and you get stuck on everything. Even the smallest object can't be stepped over, so you might be looking around in a dark room and realize you can't move, then you look down and see a severed arm or some other small object that your brain insists you should be able to step over but you can't, so you either have to walk around it or painstakingly pick it up and throw it out of the way. It makes looking for keys in the dark even more tedious than it already is.The graphics are terrible, and I guess whoever made this is aware because they tried to disguise it with a ridiculous grain filter which only makes things worse, as well as baffling light effects that only serve to obscure your vision. Every model that isn't either a tree or the ground has this this weird shininess that makes it look like an inflatable pool toy. I think the only thing that's actually animated is the werewolf, and even in the intro cutscene, the character models just stand still in a default pose while the keyframed camera slides around.The first time you encounter the werewolf, you have to run up a hill while it chases you, and it teleports so you have to shoot at it to slow it down (and your gun is single shot and takes about four seconds to reload, so you can't afford to miss). It also kills you in one hit. While this is happening, the screen blurs and you get this two-toned double image with motion trails. Combine that with the excessive film grain, the fact that everything is dark, and the eye-searing overuse of the color red. You almost literally cannot see what you're doing during this sequence. and it doesn't make the game any scarier. It just makes it stressful and frustrating. I could swear it was designed to induce migraines. With this, the game goes from being boring and tedious to thoroughly unpleasant.I don't care if this game was made by one guy. It's so terrible that he has no business charging any amount of money for it, not even the 19 cents I payed during the winter sale. Nineteen cents is almost enough to buy a gumball, and that would have been a more worthwhile use of my money. I have played free games by one-man teams that were better.This game isn't worth wasting your money on, nor is it worth your time. I promise, you had more fun reading this review than you will playing this game, and I'm not even exagerating."

This game feels like a student project more than anything else. The gameplay is clunky, the ""horror"" is entirely composed of sudden loud noises and bright flashes. The camera regularly shakes, sways, and the game intentionally skips frames to make it seem like the player is hallucinating. All this does is make horrible gameplay even worse.I can't believe a game this awful was ever approved for distribution on Steam."

The atmosphere isn't bad and it can keep you on the edge of your seat. For a horror game...the horror would be the surprise shock images and high pitched sounds that disrupt a rather peaceful listening experience. So basically cheap ""boo"" methods.The game makes a lot of use of different filters which makes visibilty a bit of a pain at times and good luck with combat. You have a rifle that only shoots one bullet so you must slowly reload after every shot. And most enemies are not one hit kills.The story line is interesting and I want to finish it to see how it ends. The music is also pretty awesome. If you can get over the slow reload, no run button (that I know of), and the tag-you-die gameover, it is a fun game to play. I would give it a 7/10."

But will they step it up with Overcast ? In Overcast you play as Walden. Walden is the most famous hunter in the land. But after a fearsome fight Walden is left injured and only leaves his home at night. One day Walden finds out that an evil spirit Zappiroth destroyed his home village killing everyone who lived there. So its up to you to pick up youre rifle and go fight the demon. So how is Overcast ? Overall this game is average. The game is a huge way better than dead bits but there are its own unique problems and ill try to say everything thats wrong and good with the game. The game is a standart FPS stuff. You can use the rifle to fight demons and bosses but its the most usseless gun in a video game ever doing very little to no damage and the reload speed is incredibly slow and in some parts of the game it doesnt help cause you have to act quickly. For the pros. Game for one guy looks pretty good nothing too special. The soundtrack is great and its the highlight of the game. The game also has pretty good atmopshere. But there are some things that i dont like about it. In some parts Walden starts to trip out and the game drops frame rates and its hard to see where you are walking. The gunplay is absolute garbage and you can never hit what you actually want to hit. Boss fights are annoying and take up too much time. The game is incredibly short only 9 chapters long. Overall i really wished there was a middle option for reviews but now im gonna give it a positive review cause the game aint that bad but its not good either. Overall get this game at a sale and enjoy this game as it is. I give Overcast Walden and the Warewolf a 6/10

Also, have to mention, they copied and pasted the fire animation and when you line two or more fires together, they all have the same animation tempo.

However, as the story unfolds, the game becomes less horror and more action packed. Which is unfortunate because the game has a downright terrible gun that takes centuries to reload and fire a shot.This makes the game frustrating as all enemies one shot the player upon touch. There are no check points; any deaths in the game cause the player to begin from the beginning of level. This becomes aggravating in the last three levels of the game; most especially in the last level."

While it was only made by two guys, Unturned was made by a teenager still in school, his game is a far better game just overall and it's free. This game however, the textures are really bad, they twist and distort textures to reuse on another model. The character Walden is unoriginal, the story is full of tropes and cliches. There is no sprint and reloading after every shot takes at LEAST 5 seconds and that's not an exaggeration by any means. It's very tedious.The character is using both hands while still somehow picking up boxes and items. During ""cutscenes"" the character model is terrible, if you've ever modded a game or seen a character model glitch out and they stand straight up with their arms out by their sides, this is the model they use for Walden in every scene,even in the scene where Walden dies, they lay him down and put his hat over his face, arms still to his sidesthey animated the enemies but didn't bother to animate the main character, good job. The boss fights? Irritating to say the least, consisting of mainly strafing and praying that Walden reloads faster, if they touch you once, you die and have to start over, ""cutscene"" and all but esc skips that, thank god.The map design? Shoddy to say the least, it might creep out a kid but for anyone who knows 2 bits about game design, it was lazily done. Each ""chapter"" takes about 5-10 minutes depending how lost you get. The game is really dark despite Walden having a lantern. The house's don't look like they could fit one person let alone a family for a ""village"" the doors are huge though. Dungeon chapter, let's copy and paste this gate texture/model all over the place, that looks spoopy.Normally my stance is, an hour of enjoyment per dollar for the game price, while I spent 2 hours on this game and it's only a dollar, most of it was from getting lost, giving up and or dying. I didn't get a single hour of enjoyment out of this, why did I even bother to keep playing it? I'm a completionist and just had to beat this game so I could uninstall it, make a review to warn others and forget it exists.

I found the game mechanics good and easy to operate and familiarise myself with but ultimately the game lacked in content you could get yourself sucked into and didn't give you the chance to connect to the character Walden mainly due to the lack of voice acting.

,Not Recommended,293180,24829131,"Posted: 11 August, 2016",all,Dark Lothbrok,"Overcast tells the tale of Walden, a hunter who survived an assassination attempt on him some years ago and lives by himself in the woods outside of a quaint little farming community. One night, he sees fire through the woods, and goes to investigate the screams he hears from the town. Armed only with a lantern that is perpetually lit and a rifle that holds only one bullet and takes seven seconds to reload, Walden tries to find out what happened to the town.Now, there’s one thing I need to take note of before I continue this review. The assassination attempt is meant to show that Walden is a tough son of a gun who knows his way around a weapon, yet he uses a gun that can only hold one round and takes ages to reload. Not the brightest hunter in my opinion. Furthermore, what does the assassination have to do with anything related to the games story? Short answer: absolutely nothing. How much do I care about the story? Answer: Not at all.Overcast is played in the first person, with your left hand perpetually holding a lantern and your right holding your useless weapon. Throughout the games nine chapters, you guide Walden around as he solves extremely easy puzzles and shoots werewolves and other evil creatures. The game controls work well enough, with the exception of climbing ladders, and it is pretty easy to move around the environment.The environment can be summed up as being mediocre at best. There is nothing special about the houses or woods that you traverse, and it doesn’t look particularly pretty either. At least, that's what it looks like when you can actually see it. Overcast does take place at night, yet it doesn’t feel natural, and I was straining my eyes just to get a proper glimpse of things that were right in front of me. On top of that, for no real reason, the game features a permanent fuzziness on the screen, almost as if you are playing it on an old television. There is no reason why it should be in the game, and it only frustrated me as time went on."

Don't expect too much of the story, because it's very simple. I liked the combat mechanics, but the game could use more of those respawn points, as I struggled in the last battle, having to skip the cutscenes over and over again. The game overused the jumpscares, the first one was really point on, but the later ones not so much.I'd give this game 6/10."

The story is...meh. Good for killing some time, but not something to look forward to as far as immersion, in my opinion. I lost interest in less than an hour."

I didn't expect much from a game that costed me 10 cents, but still.The jumpscares are cheap, there's a lot of motion blur going on at some parts which makes playing the game impossible (especially at chapter 4, where a fast, unkillable demon-dog or something is chasing you) and the story is just plain awkward.The music is really nice though, although, I feel that it didn't match the atmosphere most of the time.Either way, it's just for cards more or less..."
