76561197961494531,Recommended,293200,9902965,"Posted: 22 April, 2014",all,Rapscallion,"It's a simple, tower-defense game, nothing game-changing. But it's still fun, challenging, and forgiving at the same time.Here's a quick look I did of the game. Feel free to skip around to get a general idea of the game and what you'll be getting into. Or you can simply read my summary below.http://youtu.be/UCpTb8dBmkgI'll start off by saying it's got a good atmosphere to go along with what it is. The basic premise is that you're an anti-virus program defending off viruses, and the visuals and music that accompany it fit their their roles well to put you into that world.The basic gameplay is simple. You have lanes of creeps that mindlessly run into your core. The bare bones of all TD games. However, the game isn't as simple as plopping down a tower and forgetting about it. You have to allocate a limited pool of power to to each tower, and the more you give it, the stronger it is. So you're always frantically shifting your defenses around as the waves progress. That means you aren't staring at the screen and letting the game play itself, which is always a good thing. You also have to click little cubes and diamonds for ressources to upgrade and build your stuff, so you always have to be on the lookout for those. The game even grants you a free limited-time tower to help clean up some of the creeps that make it through, which is also nice. Nobody likes banging your head against the keyboard as the final creep runs into the core with only a sliver of health, ruining your perfect run.The music is also good, if repetitive, but that's kind of what techno is all about. I also really enjoy the fact that the music changes as you add power to different towers, and that when the tower themselves fire, they also add to the beat. It's almost as if you're remixing the song yourself.But now let's talk about some of the negatives. While the game does give you a good tutorial to get you started, it doesn't do a good job explaining the newer things you get later on down the line. It's all about trail and error. You also have no idea how much of a difference you're making when you upgrade a tower or give it power. You get a visual cue that the range has increased, but not about how much extra power you're giving it. A percentage or something would be nice to have. Also, the game kept on sending in new enemies at me that I had no idea how to deal with properly. The first being a big cube that only slows down when you constantly hit it with something. But the only thing that constantly fires is the free tower that's on a long cooldown. You also have to control it manually, so you can't allocate resources or build new things until you've finished dealing with the threat. Then the game snowballs into something you can't recover from, so you have to start over.Then there's the problem of not knowing how effective a certain tower is against a certain enemy type. I got a tower that was supposed to be effective against shielded enemies, but when they came, even at full power it wasn't that great. And when you start throwing other normal minions into the mix, you're never sure what tower you should prioritze over another as they enemies bum-rush you from all directions. And not only that, it's extremely frustrating when the tower that's effective against certain types chooses to fire at another enemy, and the one it's supposed to kill struts by unscathed. There needs to be some sort of target priority.But yeah, all of that is only a problem if you're OCD like me and want a perfect score. There's plenty of lives you can leak before you get a game over and have to retry.So in summary, this is a solid TD game at $3. The game offers good content, a variety of enemy types, keeps you engaged constantly in what's going on, interesting setting and music (if you like techno), and is genreally just a good time waster. Get it now, or even wait for a sale when this game won't cost more than a dollar. You'll get some enjoyment out of it."

So far, each stage has it's own colour pattern, looks, sound, and music. The variety has been overwhelming so far. One stage is Upbeat-House, while the next is relaxed Drum & Bass. I love it.The gameplay is really straight-forward and maybe not a huge game-changer. But the music-creation really adds that extra sense of ""Oh god I just placed a new weapon!"". Which is one of the best feelings in the game, together with gathering funds and destroying viruses.It's stressy, yet relaxing. If you're into electronic music and tower-defense games, I'd definitely recommend this!"

Your defense goes by the beat of the music, and the music changes according to your defenses, and how much power you divert between defenses. Very interesting and fun concept.For example, you don't really have any music playing without defense, or power running through it, but depending on the defense tower set, and how much power you have, the more interesting the music picks up. Keep in tune and in beat with the music to optimize your defenses. A good musical ear helps with planning (make good music) and timing your attacks/defenses (but don't be foolish with where you focus, power-wise), along with a good knowledge of strategy and patience for micromanaging (It's tower defense, it comes naturally). With good enough skill in micromanagment, a good tune might come out of the blue."

The gameplay is very boring, and the level progression goes from hard to impossible.  There's a good idea somewhere in this game but the creators failed to design it very well."

Nothing totally new about this game, but it does manage to turn what could be an annoying tower defense mechanic in other games into a much more entertaining puzzle than it rightly should be.  The musical nuts and bolts holding this game together make it a must play.  Be ready for a challenge."

WAY too micromanage-y for my current level of patience, and some of the visual effects that are taking place in the background in time with the music are REALLY distracting (clearly, I am now officially ""old""). Maybe I'll give it another try sometime in the future, but probably not…"

Beyond that it's a basic tower defense game, which I like, but an extremely basic one. Normally I'd give it points for that, sometimes you just want a simple game to kill time with, but overall I'd say this game is not that game."

76561198022820771,Not Recommended,293200,9902586,"Posted: 22 April, 2014",all,SocioPsycho,"Do not buy this game unless you love techno music, and bright lights. By love I mean, have posters on your walls of techno bands, your ipad is 3/4th techno music, and so on. The game doesn't even do that right you look at dubstep and how it has a drop and different pitches, this is more like techno generic song one A, then on to game two remix of generic song one A, and so forth.  There is no other music that I came across in my hour of play, and an hour which gave me a head ache.The music in the game plays no part in how the tower defense handles. It is no surprise that as of writing this the front page does not have a video, for it it did people would see it for what it truly is. If that's not bad enough, the back round on the screen is always exploding in some bright, in your face way with, with sound wave bars, or just odd shapes. The best way to describe this is if you have ever been to a club, stood in the middle of the dance floor, had people bumping into you, as you stare up into a strobe light and let the mind numbing, repetitive remix of the same song you heard the last 4 song melt your brain.The tower aspect of the game alone is not too bad, it can offer a challenge, and there is a volume slider in the game so you could turn the in game music off all together, and play your own music, but you would still have to deal with the brightness.At times the screen will also shake, making it feel like your in a boat, or middle of a club, trapped with little air, surrounded by mindless sheep.The way the gameplay handles, is simple, but never rewards you on winning a match, more of, yup that's nice go away do the next one like a chore.  I find it hard to believe even those who love techno music will enjoy this, but no doubt someone will, and be that as it may."

,Recommended,293200,13881720,"Posted: 7 January, 2015",all,Sereni Rikheart,"Sentinel is a tower defense game with a musical twist. Being a great fan of rhythm games, I was excited to discover it, and found the experience rather pleasant.This is my first tower defense game. It is not quite challenging, with most levels easy to pass on a few tries. Each level has a distinct feature of some sort, which is often reflected in the name (look for hints!). The bonus levels play on a single idea and are fun to pass. The game encourages you to complete the levels without losses for extra points, which are required to unlock further stages.As for the music, it contributes rather nicely to the overall experience. It does not affect the mechanics except on a few occasions, but it does add a pleasant sense of flow that is also backed with the visuals. The enemies appear and the towers fire in beat, and each event has its distinct sound. On earlier stages I played around with tower positions to create different musical patterns, but later in the game I had to concentrate mostly on beating the levels.All in all, Sentinel is a very enjoyable experience. I would place it somewhere between a game and a piece of visual art. If you appreciate rhythm as a part of gameplay, definitely give it a try."

,Not Recommended,293200,11102701,"Posted: 6 July, 2014",all,waffle,"This game is the rez of tower defense.  Your tower placement affects the music (imagine the screen as one large step sequencer) as well as events like tower shots, dying enemies, etc.The gameplay is heavy in micromanagement.  Most of the strategy involves shifting power between your towers according to enemy placement.  I found it to be tedious.  I'd rather play defense grid where I place or upgrade towers and forget about them.I barely played it, but I disliked the core gameplay mechanism.  If you want a great game+music experience, play rez."

76561198022636031,Recommended,293200,15474001,"Posted: 21 April, 2015",all,intradimensional,This game is a nice addition to the tower defense genre.  Its not complex mostly because it lacks the third dimension but it still has a depth to it which I appreciate.  There is ample opportunity to revise strategy and get a perfect level.  The music is both funky and pleasant.  It is integrated into the game audio effects very creatively.  The background animations are very well done. The windows version was still buggy when I played it.  It plays very nicely under Ubuntu.  This makes Sentinel my favourite 2d tower defense title.  8/10
