76561198084397914,Recommended,293220,17767686,"Posted: 29 August, 2015",all,NoTeVeNGooD,"To veterans of Socom:The developers are taking this game in the right direction.To those new to Socom:This game advertises ""tactical"" like Socom did when it first came out. If you were not around for Socom, the marketing team chose to do this for a few reasons:1) The game was one of the first to utilize VoIP and it came packaged with a microphone.2) You played as Navy SEALs in the single-player version of the game and could control your squad with voice commands.3) It sounded cool.This game is no more tactical than CS: GO or any of your other shooters. Do not go into this game expecting a realistic military simulator. It is not.Things that need to be added/fixed:- Round timers need to be cut by 1-2 minutes.- Inputs. The drop down list is dumb. You should be able to press a button on your keyboard/controller to override the current key. Also, alot of the input values you select do not save.- VoIP. It is hard to have a sense of community when people are constantly talking through static.- Grenades need to actually follow the ""arch"". I also feel like my character loses hold of the grenade mid-throw?- Footsteps should be removed. Right now you are put at a huge disadvantage if you choose not to camp a corner in 1v1s. I get it- listening takes skill, but it also promotes camping to an extreme.- Sniping needs a lot of work. If the crosshair is on someone when I pull the trigger, they should be dead (assuming I have my crosshairs on their head or chest). We do not need a game with bullet lag/drop or breathing mechanics. Sniping in Socom was a challenge, and it was fun. One of the biggest reasons for this is you could move in the scope and accurately fire a shot. Moving allowed you to balance out the sway as well as outplay enemy snipers in 1v1s. I encourage the developers to closely examine Socom 2 sniping mechanics.- Dragunov crosshairs need to be changed. Stick to a simple cross (+) in the scope.- Nameplate view distance should be ""Infinite"" by default.- If you can see an enemy through something  you should be able to shoot through it. I have noticed some metal railings with 2ft gaps between them that you cannot shoot through. I understand this game is in early access, but we need to fix the maps we already have before adding more.- Fall damage needs to be toned down by a lot. You should not lose half your HP when falling 10ft. Too much realism will ruin this game.- Climb option (also Jump to Climb) needs to be added for certain terrain- Headshot indicator needs to be added- I would like to see SOFs own version of SocomBattles. Maybe make a simple app to use on your phone that has everything you need to start a match vs another clan. For those of you that are not familar with SocomBattles/GameBattles, it was a website that was used to find clan vs clan matches.- This may be fixed by lowering my graphics setting, but the ""sunshine rays"" are extremely annoying in the new snowy Sismis. They make it hard to see.Additional Comments:- Movement speed is spot on.- No kill cam is good.- Grenade aiming and gun crosshairs are like Socom 2- The ""gun-up"" feature is in this game. For new players, when your gun becomes ""erect"" that means an enemy (or enemy body) is nearby. Use this to your advantage."

Really impressed, and its a shame if the early version of this early release was a let down, because people need to get back on and try it.Dont regret the money at all, and as long as you got a good trigger finger and know the playstyle of strafing/using 3rd person to spot enemies, you'll hold your own. (Havnt lost it even after so many years).Again, impressed. No more CS:GO for me.Negatives?Low playerbase (Cant attest to all time zones, im EST) but enough to have atleast a game going during primetime, and yes it can appear a bit sluggish but honestly to me it doesnt feel sluggish, just has a slightly low frame rate.I'll refine this half♥♥♥♥♥review as I play more."

It's going to take new players and new players on STEAM are used to the relative polish of even early access Steam games.I WANT this game to be a hit, I just wish it went to early access market with a little more patience and polish.

However, I recently built a PC and the game was only $10 so I bought it and I must say it feels much more like the experiences I've had in the past with similar PS2 games.The game seems to be getting better and the new(but old) maps are great. I honestly never thought I'd buy this game but I did and I don't regret it. If you're a SOCOM fan and have $10 to spare, buy this game. You won't not be disappointed."

It was hard for even Zipper to try and recapture the same formula with their sequels to previous titles, so a totally new developer coming in and trying to do that seemed to be ludicrous. But after playing a few games, I can see the amount of potential this title has. Don't get me wrong, this game needs A LOT of work.... A LOT. But as far as the gameplay right now, there is a solid foundation laid and with the proper fixes and polishes, I really believe that H-Hour can rekindle that addiction that most of us long time SOCOM players are so desperately looking for. SOF studios, you get a thumbs up for trying to appeal to this tight knit community (and sometimes stubborn). I just hope you stick to your word and improve this game the way I know you can. Thanks for getting it this far and I look forward to future content and updates!"

I myself played a very small amount of Socom 2 but a TON of Socom Confrontation. This game feel so similar to Socom 2 its ridiculous. Of course there are bugs and a handful of problems but this game has also just been released to the public. This might be the nostalgia speaking but atm i would give this game a solid 9/10. Once the developers fix what needs to be fixed and adds what needs to be added, This game will be perfect from a tactical shooter standpoint."
76561198157373638,Recommended,293220,25327126,"Posted: 3 September, 2016",all,DigitalXtreme,I've been a Socom fan since the beginning and I can honestly say this game brings back that nostalgic feeling of the series. The game still suffers from glitches and bugs but that's to be expected with any early access game. It also hasn't been fully optimized yet though u can adjust the settings yourself to your liking but that only does so much until the games full optimization is complete by the developers. The multiplayer is fun but suffers from not having a huge community of players to play with. I feel this will change though if and when the games final version is released. Rest assured that SOF Studios is dedicated to making this game the best it can be with constant server and games updates. For $10 you can't beat the price with the shape the game is in which is neither good or bad. It's just incomplete but I would definitely recommend this to a friend. Keep up the good work!

There is a learning curve, but to get to the point where you are good enough to hold your own is easy due to this game's minimalistic features. The reason I bought this game was to play with a buddy from the console Socoms.As it is, this game is a good game, in that you can have fun and play it for about 1-2 hours a day. More than that and you start to realize where some of the criticism is coming from.Get it, play for an hour or two, get off = decent time playing the game.P.S- Watch out for the camping fiend, SomeYoungGuy."

This is my view of H-Hour: World's EliteFirst of all, I played a couple games to see how this game actually is and I was very very very surprised on how it reminds me of the beloved SOCOM we all used to play. On top of that, now with the workshop they're bringing back all the old maps that you and I grew to love (i.e - Fish Hook!!!!!!!!) Another thing is that SOF is a very small studio (not quite sure how many, but no more than 15) and all the people who downvote this game are the ones who want a game that is identical to the SOCOM games we used to play. You have to give SOF studio ALOT of credit for even listening to their fans and taking the risk on creating a game like this. Yes, the game has some flaws but all of those will be fixed faster than most games that are in alpha stage. Games like DayZ and Arma 3 are still in alpha and they'll continue to be there because the Devs dont care about the community. SOF studios acutally cares about what us, the fans want. So all of the people who downvote this game shouldn't even be considered ""Fans"" of the SOCOM series or H-Hour game. This game has huge potential, we just have to give it time. Please tell your friends about this game so we can recreate the same joy that we had for SOCOM 1, SOCOM 2, SOCOM 3, and SOCOM Combined Assault!!!!HAVE HOPE GUYS, WE WILL GET A GAME LIKE SOCOM WHICH IS WHAT WE ALL LOVE!!!"

H-Hour is a 3rd person tactical shooter that feels and plays just like to original Socoms, right down to the victory dances. With the inclusion of the Steam Workshop, you can even download and play the old school Socom maps such as Frostfire and Desert Extraction.

It sucks that the community is so small we all get on at a specific time of day, usually in the evenings after work which is great.

The Devs are doing well with updates even tho it does seem they like to take their time. Now all this being said, this game must allow some sort of clan ladder matchmaking system. a ranking system, and proper 4v4/8v8/16v16 classic servers, but that all depends on players... playing lol.

,Recommended,293220,16019934,"Posted: 26 May, 2015",all,KillScreen,"Edit: review updated to match the current patchLet me start by saying that i'm not an old school socom fan, i'm just a third person shooter lover with +50 third person games in the last 5 years on my list both on steam and consoles on my background. So this review is oriented to ppl who couldn't care less about the girls locker room dramas associated with this game and answer one thing: - are you about to buy a good game?If you're looking for a finished product or you're just a first person shooter kind of guy, the answer is no. There's no competitive third person shooter that can implement first person perspective and done it right, and h-hour is no exception. Even if you enjoy third person games or third person co-op´s, i still don't believe this would be a game that you would enjoy enough to call your money worth as it is right now.But if you dig games like competitive third person shooters this is definitely a game that you should get. What you're going to find here is really solid mechanics that you can easily pull out +100 hours out of it. If you wanna know why, keep reading.Gameplay: - What makes the “sockrak” formula so addicting is how the mechanics of the gunfights work. Basically whoever knows how to strife and keep the aim on the opponent wins. Shooting is not easy though, just by having the cross hairs on the enemy isin’t enough to to register a shot as there’s no aim assist in this game or an aim button that would make your crosshairs any tighter. The first shot will always be to the center, the next ones will go up. You don’t have mid body cover (in third person view at least), making the camper to expose himself entirely and give the rusher a fair fight that never feels unfair. These mechanics are unique to socom, you won't find another third person shooter like this in the market.You got bullet drop as well. The camera works like it should for most part, even though it still needs some tweaking. In some corners the camera goes into the model head instead of the top of the head, blocking the player vision. The lean feature seems useless at first, but its definitely a good implementation as it helps you with camera angles as well, but totally useless as a cover system. Getting from prone to standing is slow and sluggish, not always being the best option when in a gun fight.The netcode is really good even on high pings. There’s some other bugs like you can’t crouch while reloading, but those are minor things already being taken care of and are not game breaking enough to be mentioned.Graphics: - Overall it’s a pretty looking game. Game is still not optimize and you can expect a 10 to 20 fps increase in the future. Some graphical glitches here and there but nothing game breaking. No SLI support for now and I don’t know if they ever will.Maps: - Only two for the moment. Close to perfect and feel updated to today’s standards. I really think the team made a right move here. You get everything you need when it comes too good map design. A good sense were the enemy is rushing, power points, hard to get spots, nade spots to every camping corner, and the usual “left right and mid” route is simple enough to new players. Not being able to use mid body cover just feels right. Whoever is doing these maps really knows what is doing. Thank god they did the right call in not getting this talent wasted in copy/paste work of the old maps (even if they could) and an actual evolution with new updated and tested techniques. Map editor is being consider so that everyone can enjoy despise their personal taste on this matter.Game modes: - Team death match and demolition. Its would be nice to see more team objective modes, as it makes some equipment being put to use like smoke grenades. Without voice chat and visuals on the objectives, everything’s casual for now. Since there’s no stats online, ppl are mature and friendly for the most part and will not stress you out for not playing properly. Most people pick their servers by number of players not by game type, you will find yourself playing whatever on low ping.Sound: - Guns sound really good, but overall it still needs a ton of work yet. There’s sound whoring in this game. If a player is moving the sound whoring is generous enough for him to be heard across an entire building. The music is just ok, some piano tunes you will turn it off after an hour. There’s no voice chat and only way you have to communicate with your team is by text chat. Without voice chat the team play is not there yet.Servers: - Fast dedicated servers, server list, ping values, recently played players list working. What else could you ask for?Overall this is a really fun game above all. But as it is you will just play this game in short bursts. Old socom fans know what they want and what they want is something really good, special and unique. We could either see the rise of a really solid game or the fall of an underrated one. Only time will tell."
,Not Recommended,293220,22434826,"Posted: 15 April, 2016",all,Miss Nemesis,"I can not recommend this game in it's current state at all. Sure, the game can be fun at times, but there are too many negative aspects to it.First of all, the game is running on Unreal Engine 4. Don't get me wrong, graphics aren't the most important thing to me, but they look very dated. If I wouldn't know this runs on UE4, I would assume this runs on Unreal Engine 2.5  (Also the game crashed multiple times with an Unreal Engine 4 fatal error.)The in game voice chat isn't really helpful. It sounds bad and sometimes it's choppy as well. It often happens that shots don't do any damage or get registered due to the bad hitboxes and hit detection.The movement / controls feel very stiff as well as the animations. There are not many characters and almost no customisation. There is an okayish amount of weapons. Some more characters, weapons and more customisation would be a nice thing though.The biggest issue with this game is it's playerbase, it is almost non existant. If you're lucky enough to find people, then only on US servers which isn't that great for european players. Also the small core group that's playing has hundreds of hours in this game, and will give you a hard time as a newbie.Bottom line:It's not worth the 15€ price tag. The game has potential, but lacks polish, a vital playerbase and content. If you decide to buy it, then get it while it's heavily discounted.PS: The devs don't seem to be very active on their own steam forum.EDIT: Seems like some players of the community are completely toxic and will personally attack you if you write a negative review. I also got told I shouldn't even write a negative one, if I don't have anything positive to say about the game. This behaviour is unacceptable."

Until now. Yes this game is nowhere near perfect & has a lot to improve on before reaching optimization, hence the Early Access. But even in it's current state, this game does what the previous two Socom titles themselves couldn't do... Capture that feeling.I haven't stopped playing this game, despite purchasing The Witcher 3 the very same day. With only having 2 maps & 2 game modes, this game still manages to hold my attention like no modern shooter has in quite some time. Video games are simply not made with the ""Classic Socom"" feel anymore, and that's what makes H-Hour so special.I highly recommend to get in on the Early Access for $24.99, considering the fact that this game is only going to get better. Whether you're a die hard Socom fan like myself, or someone who is simply wondering... ""What exactly is a Socom?"" This game represents a specific genre of gaming that seems to have been forgotten, but has potential to do absolutely amazing things for the lost breed."

SOF did a great job with H-Hour. H-Hour is a lot of fun, it's responsive, is pretty good looking, and feels like the old games. This is what Socom 3 was suppose to be.It's unfortunate that I'm just getting around to playing it after the Early Access was released (a year ago), but small budget projects can't afford advertising which leads me to the only concern I have. Socom fans got to get the word out and get their friends on this game. The community needs to grow a bit because having clans and tons of people to kill was 50% of the socom experiance. If there are ♥♥♥♥ing people who pay for Shower with dad simulator, Goat simulator, any of the Robert Yang games or hell even crappy♥♥♥♥♥battle field 3&4, or any other shovelware then why the hell wouldn't people play a decent and fun shooting game like H-hour? Don't buy Cod or BF just buy 4 copies of H-hour and hand them out for a good time it's still better then battlefront. If you want a real FPS then go play Insurgency or more realism then Arma 3. But H-Hour is all about mind games and intense fire fights in beautiful 3rd person.To the negative reviewers I will dimiss them as either 1. Not understanding what ""Early Access"" means, 2, Just plain potato aim cry baby rage quiters blaming lag 3. Comparing this game to modern shooters when its a game trying to emulate a 14 year old game and is supported by this community and isn't developed by a major studio (no offence SOF).

It is very promising and, despite the rougher elements, is a lot of fun to play and is by no means frustrating.Cons:Hit detection, bullet velocity, damage, and grenade AOE are a little unpredictable.Conclusion:If you are a SOCOM vet this will feel very familiar and somewhat satisfying. This has a lot of promise. I'll stick with it and provide suggestions. SOF Studios seems very engaged with the Twitch streamers and steam community in terms of feedback. Their Trello board is available to view for those wondering when refinements will be made and additional maps/guns/game modes will be released. When in doubt, realize this is a $25 early release for an eventual $60 title and it is concentrating on the basics before adding in the cosmetic flare indicative of a finished product as to not mislead anyone who purchases early access."

I feel the community needs to grow more, maybe a good way if it hasn't been done is create a LFG so if one server is full and others what to play without sitting on a empty server it can make a difference. On the graphics and performance wise it runs great, frames will go down depending on what map it is, like xroads i get 62 fps but in other maps its 40 to 60 fps mainly because of fogs and other stuff i assume. My build: AMD A10-7890k at 4.7ghz OC, 16 gb 2133 ddr3 ram, and rx 480 8gb; playing on a 1080p monitor.Overall the games good to my taste and standard, brings back a socom taste, only played socom 2, 3, and CA, I did not owned a PS3 for Confrontration.Solution:1.

As of this date they are still in early stages, and havent released what i believe is the core of the game. All the complaints on this game are typical of early access games.This is the silent socom successor, this is all there is thats left, and will probably be the only one ever made - so if you liked the; hiding in the shadows and waiting for the enemy to breach while using your headset to 'check' if your team is still alive and in position hiding- only for them not to respond - and you start to doubt your hiding spot is safe enough as they come blowing through the backdoor- then this is for you. Though headset support has not been developed, it is promised (though its not like there isnt other options for headset services, this is is pc after all).The shooting mechanic is sort of arcadey, where you strafe and dodge while you try to outshoot the enemy in a dogfight- i believe this mechanic is what makes the game stand out, because... its simply fun to do. Maybe not realistic, but fun, and i feel as if we are really fighting it out. And i think this combined with the fact that people hiding have a certain advantage due to the third person perspective, they still give the player who gets ""jumped"" a chance to show off his skills and outshoot him. There is a certain awe of knowing a player can take out 2 to 3 people based on his skill to maneuver around and shoot it out.What made socom socom was its shootout mechanic, stealth-based approach where camping was expected, and its amazing level design. What is missing is the levels and the great level design, i hope they can emulate the socom 2 maps, draw from what made those maps popular and recreate a new version of it."

They are constantly patching, which is great, but overall progress is slow. It's way too hard to just get into this game and start having fun. Most of the player-base is well-seasoned and has pretty legitimate skills. SOCOM was a hardcore game, but you didn't just dive in to ranked and start effing ish up. It took a lot of time to master weapons, maps, and mechanics. But the most important part of SOCOM was always the tactics and communication with your team. That is still there, but in the most minimal form. There are not enough players to create that gritty clan competition that used to dominate ranked. That's what I miss most about the old SOCOMs. Was being able to join a respawn or a casual ranked game, meet up with recruiters, and find a clan that fit your personality and playstyle. Once you had teammates to back you up, it really motivated you to get better so you could hold them down in all of the crazy firefights and intense shootouts.

I tried to play a couple of games each night and stay active but with the low content i found i was getting bored fast so now really only play when there is a patch too check out the new goodies that get added.After watching the Q&A with Tom on twitch i have faith this game is actually going to make it and look forward to spending many hours on it like i did years ago on Socom 2.

Need bots. spawns for bots, something for when servers are dead.I figured I would jump right in, I have faith in the developer, due to if they just add Bots for a terrorist hunt mode, to play co-op with friends, or just spawn bots to hinder players from attacking demolition zones for example.this feels like a quality product thus far, amd I would definitely keep this on your radar, and maybe make some friends who want to play the game the right way.

Besides that, this game fall far short from the game it tries to emulate. There is no consistency, this game you can do the same exact thing and get a different outcome everytime you do it. NO ONE PLAYS IT! There is about 1 server full (16 people) at the most, I've seen since I got this game. When you get idiots that just dodge back n forth from sniper distance, jumping like an idiot and pray n spraying, getting more accurate shots than laying down on the ground sniping. Some how the idiot jumpin around, with no more tactical sense than kids playing hide n seek, hits you with a head shot...and your bullets never kill him...lying down....with a sniper rifle?I have actually watched bullets come out of my weapon at an angle or two bullets at once! And the movement across the map just doesn't feel right, This game was made for team work, and says that solo play will only get you so far...LMAO Then how is it that so many people can wipe out entire teams on their own. I would say the only thing consistant about H-Hour is how many lone bullerproof heros there are every game. If they fix the bullet mechanics, and made it to where you really need to play as a team, then I would highly recommend it. I hope they do fix it. Till then I'll keep checking in and seeing if anything gets fixed, taking random trips down memory lane. The game needs more support than it has."

The reason for this particular review is the potential that I see in this game. If any one Remembers SOCOM Confrontation from PS3, then this will bring back memories and hopefully this game will spark some new interest. As far as the gameplay goes YES it is Choppy at times and a little glitchy but playable, So far it is evenly matched and can be really fun. Yes it is early release so I can't be too judgmental on the problems I have experienced. Yes a lot of crashing at the community menu, standard graphic glitches like getting stuck in an area and not being able to move, Throwing Frags is a nightmare because sometimes you see those things fly off to the left or right when they should be going forward. and this one is the worst, NOT being able to see your teammates name over his head and you start shooting at them, it's not until you get close enough that you realize you were shooting at them. I don't want to get too detailed, However, but all I can say is there were a lot of people playing and they seemed to be having the same issues and still trying to enjoy the game. Surprisingly enough I did not get too frustrated from being shot or blown up, You just have to remember that it's in it's early stages and it will get better.Update 31 May. So I have a few hours logged so far and I can say that the game itself is getting better, perhaps not by much but just enough to make a slight difference, There does seem to be a serious amount of lag between players though, for instance unloading on someone and clearly not missing them but they turn around and within a second they cut you down and subsequently there after take out a few more players, this is to be expected though, but....there are a few players already accusing one another of cheating somehow, I am not quite sure myself but regardless the game is coming along. the character movement seems to be more fluid, smoother and they have fixed a few minor details with grenades. All in all It is getting much better"

Just a hit or miss sometimes depending on the day. I can thank the Summer Sale though since I copped it for $4.99 so at that price I'd say it was worth it. Normally $10.00 but that's not so bad either. I mostly play it jus to have a fun quick pick up game whenever I'm bored.

In no time you will find a group of friend's to always play the game with and reach perfection and enjoyable moments like no other.

This game definately has a SOCOM look, and the Map designs are good. however there just seems to be  issues currently that stand out, First thing i Noticed was the UGLY yellow writting, Secondly was the UGLY User Interface or UI/ the weapons are White on the UI and the menus Lack. the sound when clicking for servers is bland and ugly as well.  This at a first glance was unnattractive in comparison to todays standards. Animations need more Improvements but once again this game is in early access state. with a year behind this title from its current state, we might be Looking at something that could do decent numbers If the game is optimized propertly and the animations seem to get better. currently jumping feels sluggish and floaty.... as well as prone. i really feel like the character should jump into prone or slide into prone. I also noticed the lean camera seems like it should shift more out as the character leans left or right. The options menu was very Simple which is great for new comers but it also just lacked too much as far a custimization goes. map slows down on factory in the lower tunnels. i notice gunfire decreases but when im out of the area my gun fires at its normal rate when using the SSD. The music repeats over and over as if The music score never was FInished,  the female voice overs are decent but it seems that there is not enough content to be delivered. certain guns make me wish i was able to scope in 50m but nothing more such as the ak or m16a1. but i cant. dissapointing but maybe it will change. overall the game modes allow for some serious addicting gameplay but there is alot of work that needs to be done overall to the base foundation of this title to get players to play.i think 6 maps would do this title well with maybe a future map builder for the community/ I think animations are rough especially when switching between prone and stance. camera angle through dores need to be fixed. crosshairs tend to aim at the back of the characters head while running through doors or tight hallway spaces. this could be fixed by having the charact auto switch to firstperson through tight spaces and auto switching to thirdperson once out of a tight space.or by having the character become transparent during these scenarios. voice chat needs work and there needs to be clan functionality as well. a jump to climb and jump over rail animation would be nice as well, would i recommend this title. Yes because im pretty sure this company will continue to update this game over time. yes it has more weak points currently than strong points but there is a core foundation here and its addictive gameplay reminds me of my ps2 days of playing socom2 .  buy it and support it. if your a Call of duty fan H hour is not for you. if your a die hard socom fan h hour  is not for you. H hour is kind of its own game with roots from other shooters. i can see this title being on console only if the studio and dev team truly listen to its BACKERS. if the studio intends to make h hour the next big thing then they need to pull out the old socom games and completely use that formula as reference to mimic it the best they can. then only will they pull in new comers and the old die hard vets. was it worth 15 dollars, as of now NO. but im sure it will be worth 30 bucks by the time its finished."

I hate to use the 'P' word but this has serious potential if it gets funded. While there is good arsenal of weapons available at the moment there are only two maps which are at least are well crafted and balanced. The biggest problem is the lack of VC and dedicated servers. The game runs well enough on my GTX 980 and my AMD-fx 8350 in 1080p at a capped 62 FPS but then again my specs are above the recommended hardware. I feel the price should be $14.99 for what's on offer but the dev's are in desperate need of cash to fund this. This is what Early Access was meant for.

It's been HALF A YEAR since my initial review and pretty much nothing has changed aside from a new map and map tools given to the community. The progress on this title is just way, WAY too slow. I'm fairly certain the game will be dead soon and the devs will move on to something else chalking this up as a first attempt at making games that failed.I wanted to give this a fair shake, and you can see my original review below but i just can't tell people this is worth taking a chance on when i no longer believe this game is going anywhere but up in flames. It's over. It started off as a great idea with a great lead who jumped ship and left the title to rot. Nothing more to see here.This is a tough one for me. I was one of those guys who backed H-Hour from the start. I've poured dozens and dozens of hours into making videos on youtube to both spread awareness and keep the community connected. I feel this game was released on EA too soon. I've voiced that opinion several times and it got me nowhere fast. But the real question is do i feel like this game is worth your money?It depends on several factors.1. Are you a Socom fan from back in the day?2. Are you willing to risk $15 on a potential failure?3. Do you care about the personal politics a studio sets forth or community relations?4. Are you willing to accept that early access is a rough, ugly, and often long process on steam?For me personally, at this point i think it's worth the buy in price. Personal feelings aside for SOF studios... and trust me i have a long history with them and it's mostly bad. But i have to give them credit from dropping the price down to a decent rate, I still believe it should have been that price to begin with and would have saved them A LOT of frustration but i digress...I have some faith in Kevin and Russ to pull this off, i really think we need to see more maps and a map editing tool for the community so we can recreate our favorite Socom maps and build new ones. I think this is DIRE, and NEEDS to happen soon. I fear for the future of H-Hour, some bad decisions have been made. But i have had some fun with it over the free weekend and i do plan on making a purchase. I recommend the game to those of you willing to risk it, and i recommend it for those of you who view Socom 1-3 as the greatest online era ever created. For the every day casual steam user?

This game is nowhere close to being complete and it is not worth the price tag in it's current state. The mechanics feel very clunky and broken, even for a game that's EA. If you're familiar with the series this game is supposed to success the only noticeable thing is the voice actor who did HQ. The key bindings barely work if at all, the controller support or lack there of is an absolute joke, the sensitivity doesn't work, weapon selection doesn't work (needs to be done every round or it resets, this is a glitch that was prominent on a title this game that was said to success the developers should have known better). In it's current state I do not suggest buying this game, the only people that might get some enjoyment out of it are the ones that want the spiritual successor to SOCOM a casual player that just enjoys shooters will likely fund pure frustration with this games mechanics, and bare bones features.

Every patch are things we don't need or things that should be lower on the priority list. This most recent patch(NERF) was a complete overhaul of the games gun mechanics, along with the new trash version of unreal engine. Things they never have been able to fix are hit detection. Which greatly declined this last patch. Why play a game if your bullets don't register on your target? The gun mechanics were completely nerfed, they don't want people with real skill in aiming to headshot you on the first bullet. Most of the maps are terrorist based i.e., the terrorist hide and seals get wall banged or naded. Currently the ak74 full auto is the most accurate gun. Anyone can pick that gun up full auto someone from across the map and get ez headshots. They also did something with the latency for higher ping players. For example there is a delay for when you pull the trigger to when your bullets come out. Higher ping players have to prefire even more to make sure the bullets go to target....Oh And on top of that they have to fire in front of a targets movement direction because of the delay(trace in front of target), this occurs at any distance even 5 feet. Watching some play back of recent games will make you wonder why you wasted your time on this game. Initially I played this game because the kickstarter said it was going to be like Socom was. I continued to play this game for the player created maps. Sof studios has yet to make a map I enjoy playing.If you want my credibility, look at how many hours I have played and my stats on the leader boards.There are a lot more things to add in this review that I will follow up with later."

It's free, yet it has more potential, has the basic framework for nearly all it's features laid out, has supportive devs who will keep working whether people support it or not, and they realize they need CONTENT, BEFORE going on Early Access. All of this in a free Tech Preview, versus the 25 dollars for this.Heck, Rainbow Six 3 is still good. SWAT4 if you can get it running, use Evolve or something. Ghost Recon Online if you get in a good group, all more tactical than this, probably more tactical than this will ever be, judging by the horrible lack of content and features/properly implemented mechanics ingame at the moment.In this day and age, you cannot use the ""Early Access"" excuse. You are charging money for a product, and it has less content than some other EA games even. Look at Killing Floor 2. Look at Insurgency when it was in EA, or Kerbal Space Program when it was in EA.Early Access is a poor excuse. This is not a place to upload babby's first pre-alpha, and charge people 25 dollars for it.If the Steam community hub would have loaded for me, I wouldn't have bought this, and could have got another game.As it was, Steam was being stupid and not loading so I took the risk, and am regretting it.Now if things completely turn around, I will update this. But looking at the road the devs are taking community wise, and the current state of the ""game"", I'm just not seeing that happening honestly.EDIT: The community is also incredibly hostile and apparently hates every other tactical game out there for no legitimate reason.So much for being mature SOCOM ""vets"".As you may be able to see by my reviews ratings, people hate hearing the truth about things, just like what happened with my Alien Isolation review, getting hate and even death threats.I'm trying to protect the consumer here, not cater to peoples fanboyism or biasedness."

It gives the players an idea of what the graphics will roughly look like in the final product and allows you to shoot some people along the way.From what I understand, they had this game nearly completed with many more features and animations to the point of being a fairly finished game, but it was using the Unreal 3 Engine.  Now they are in the process of taking what they had on the Unreal 3 Engine and converting it to the Unreal 4 Engine, which isn't as simple as copy pasting.  So this is the current state of the game we are able to play, the beginning of this conversion.  So there are currently a lot of features not yet in the game that were in the Unreal 3 Engine version of the game, they took a slight step back to take a bigger step forward.  But it will take more time, clearly.The game may not currently be worth the money for the gameplay in the current state, but I would argue that if you are a socom fan, it's worth the money for the support and funding so they can get the job done, because you can easily see and feel that even in this shell of a game, socom is in there, it has huge potential if it reaches its final state."

I've clearly killed someone, then froze and died as a result.Bloom is broke. I've used an M4a1SD (most accurate gun) and had my crosshairs dot right on someones chest, held down the trigger and mist entire clips without a single hit. Literally 1-2 clips on full auto while at medium range, every single shot misses. Gun fights are too much determined by RNG of bloom. Actually aiming at people does little to nothing.Nobody is ever playing. People simply cannot play the game, and the developers claim we should sit in an empty room for hours hoping it'll fill up if we can't get a spot. Sorry but I don't want to wait an hour for my clan to get a spot in the only 8v8 room up.Ultimately this game has potential, but is extremely broken due to the staff at SOF.
