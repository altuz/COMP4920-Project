,Recommended,293240,15688798,"Posted: 4 May, 2015",all,Goldyray! ^_^,"I was first sceptical, especially after the first few playthroughs but I'm a sucker for upgrades when done right and slowly but surely I became stronger and next thing I knew a 10 minute play session turned into two hours and now I'm hooked. If you like planet hopping physics and planting seeds to make planets grow (and give you health) then this is for you. I'm a 33 year old male and find it hard to get into games the older I get, even though I still love them.  So, if you find yourself in the same boat and are looking for a casual game where you die often (and that's okay) then this is for you! Anyway, I'm not great at writing reviews, this is my first one. I liked the game that much I felt compelled to come here and tell you all that I love it!"
,Recommended,293240,15589059,"Posted: 27 April, 2015",all,Techbane,"It's certainly unique. So the basic mechanics are: jet around in space from planet to planet, planting trees to restore them. Once a planet is restored, it dispenses a random treasure and heals you. While this is going on you will be assaulted RELENTLESSLY by enemy aliens, which gets pretty frustrating. I was having Spore flashbacks for a while. After X time has passed, a massive boss monster will spawn, which necessitates jetting through space while managing your fuel and hopefully hopping between restored planets for healing. This is the phase where you'll usually die horribly and start over -- and if you don't, you plod on until the next boss spawns.From treasure chests you'll either get some gems (for postgame upgrades), bombs, bricks (build largely ineffective towers with), or artifacts. Artifacts can be traded in for mutators accessible from the main menu, such as disallowing towers, more enemies, less enemies, ""no eggs"" (???) and the like. Most of these are also largely ineffectual, as I've noticed no difference even playing with fewer enemies and lower enemy health. Each time you start a new game the galaxy will be mostly randomized, including planetoids, what types of enemies will appear, and whether or not weapon powerups (which are crucial, as you can't buy weapon upgrades) will actually appear. The RNG swing is kind of ridiculous, I've had games where apparently every chest has contained an artifact, and others where they don't seem to exist. I've repeatedly gotten duplicate artifacts, and sometimes I've been unable to trade a new artifact in for no apparent reason. I somehow collected a pickup from a boss after the game was over despite dying to it, which gave me a white screen and a weird three-minute musical number.It's really hard to tell how much of this game is actually functioning as intended, what's glitching out and what's just plain dickish design, and much like Rogue Legacy the necessitation of perishing repeatedly to grind upgrades is starting to rub me the wrong way, but to a certain extent I'm still quite enjoying it anyway. I'm just not sure if it's more fun or frustrating yet."

Visual style is kawaii and neat, every planet is colorful and different. During exploring you will be swarmed by many different foes, some of them are annoying, some of them are really bad. Boss fights are nice but ice dragon is overpowered and the green cloud boss is really easy, you can just stand in one place and shoot around until it's defeated. When I was almost done with the game I found some kind of easter egg or boss, still don't know what was that because I was immediately terminated by blue screen of death (in the game). About artifacts - it's hard to find the place to bring the artifact back, for me it's not worth it. I think the solution would be some kind of radar to point where you need to go. There are some weapons to unlock but they are expensive, after 2 hours I was able to buy homing blaster which is worse than laser blaster that costs 15x less. Some upgrades are too expensive and I was not even bothering to buy them. And one more thing, when you accidentaly find the crystal there is 80% opportunity its a monster..."

I am incredibly impressed with this game and how much the developer continues to add to it. I love playing this game and so do all of the people that I've shown it to. While this game can be difficult and it is easy to get lost, it is a great play and it keeps bringing me back for more. Cosmochoria is fresh and new, I've never played anything like it.

Here's why:The developer of this game is fantastic. I had a rather lengthy discussion with him about various aspects of the game I thought could be improved, and we talked about some of the logic and thought processes behind our opinions. These discussions resulted in an update in the game. Needless to say I now have a huge amount of respect for this developer.I am still trying out these new updates, but am largely enjoying the changes. Reasons to buy the game:-You are supporting a great dev-It is funny and cute, and those things will come in handy when tackling the difficult enemies present in the game.-Gameplay customization. The weapon upgrades allow you to change your gameplay to something that suits you. None of the initially unlocked weapons upgrades are any better than any of the other weapons by straight numbers (I still haven't unlocked two of the weapons) , so play around and see which one serves you the best.-It's a bullet storm with a purpose. It's a semi-rogue-like with a funand potentially non-linearsave feature. It's an interplanetary, psychadelic gardening simulator. You start the game off naked."

Amazing value during a sale.Explore a procedurally-generated galaxy using a jetpack, grow plants to terraform planets in order to heal yourself, shoot a variety of enemies with fun weapons, and uncover the secrets of a post-cataclysmic universe. Great fun.Beautiful 2D art with a lot of character, and a very polished overall feel.The controls feel very smooth and responsive (I've been using a 360 controller) and there's a good variety of unlocks and content to discover.Although there's no saving of galaxy progress, it's possible to start a new game in a galaxy that's at roughly the same stage as when you've defeated one of the game's bosses, so if you wish you can ""skip"" bosses you've already defeated. Plus, all your unlocks and bricks (the resource used for building turrets and other structures) are retained when you die or quit the game, ready for the next attempt.The developer is very responsive to the community and seems very friendly and reasonable. In short, deserving of your support if you like the sound of the game!"

The has still a lot of possibilities and probably some more updates for more feautres. Cosmochoria has a good and cute atmosphere yet challenging at the same time. Everytime you start anew, the map is randomized and basically your goal is to defend yourself while planting plants in a planet. Everytime you plant, the plant recovers and gives you health if it is fully recover. You could also upgrade stuff and turrets (the pyramid with one eye). I recommend this game because it is fun and a good game overall."

I'm pretty sure I got it on sale, but honestly, I'd have paid the full price knowing what I was about to experince. The game's premise is that you're an astronaut, wearing nothing but a helmet, terraforming worlds to support (plant) life again after a galaxy wide apocalypse. You do this by putting around on a jetpack, planting seeds as you go, although all kinds of aliens will try to stop you. At first, this game is going to kick your butt so hard, you'll be farting out of your eyes, but each kill, each secret item found, each boss annilated will make you even more powerful for your next playthrough. I will personally keep playing this game (as I already have for hours now) , and I strongly recommend you buy it and do the same. With a story shrouded in mystery, tons of plants, even more bullets, poetic style achievements, and an egg I still haven't figured out how to hatch, this game is a real catch."

,Recommended,293240,14202873,"Posted: 27 January, 2015",all,Asvarduil,"Once upon a time, there was an Ancient Great Black Wyrm who ate the Earth.  However, a little baby in a rocket-propelled basket, and some other generally forgettable NPCs escaped the calamity!  Somehow, everyone - except the baby - learned how to breathe atmospheres with lower pressure than the Armstrong limit, in order to facilitate the baby's future revenge.No, this is not D&D; this is Cosmochoria, a simple and refreshing action-roguelike.  In this game, the goal is to reinvigorate as many worlds with life as you can!  However, enemies - who shoot lasers, for good measure - intend to stop you.  There are also gems that you need to pick up, so that when you inevitably die, you can buy supplies and important upgrades so that the next time takes a little longer to kill you.What WorksFirst, each planet has its own gravity, which makes the shooter gameplay really interesting, because you have to learn to aim around the planet you're on.  Also, the gravity serves a more important purpose - being anchors for the deep space, Asteroids-esque travel you do through the title.  On a planet, you can move and jump as you'd expect.  In space, however, gravity goes away, and all of a sudden it's up to the supplies in your jetpack to nudge your velocity such that you intercept other planets.There's a neat TD mechanic in this game, in the form of the things that bricks can create.  You can fortify a planet with towers of various kinds, which is oh-so-necessary, because every third planet you revive invariably leads to a boss fight, against at least one big, nasty Chinese dragon, who spews projectiles the way you spew...well, never mind.  Moving along.What doesn't workThe first parts of the game allow you to progress really fast, but for me after getting the Laser Pistol - an exceptionally useful upgrade - the game slows to a crawl for me, probably because I'm having difficulty beating the Fire Dragon.  It seems that beating bosses unlocks some upgrades, which leads to a slight balance problem between a boss standing between you and an upgrade you need to more easiliy defeat it, instead of the game giving you tools that actually help you defeat the boss.Should You Buy This Game?Yes, if on sale.I'd absolutely say it's worth $4.99.  I think the normal price is high for the game that you're actually getting."

Weapon upgrades are pointless as well, since when you get hit you lose them and most of the times they are not worth recovering. And above all, the game is very repetitive after a while.It's not that bad, but having to choose between yes and no, I'd rather not recommend it."

The player travels through a galaxy of 50 planets, planting seeds, crafting defence towers and shields, battling bosses and probably saves the galaxy by beating the so-called cataclysm- a variety of powerups and perks. In every stint you do you will gain credits which you can invest in powerups and perks before starting another one. Those will permanently boost your abilities and thus make it easier to progress further. Very motivating!- neat cartoonish graphics and funny dialogues- Over 20 ""artifacts"" (to be randomly found in chests that pop up as rewards for revived planets) to twist gameplay mechanics in either a positive or a negative way, such as half/double damage, no planet healing, fast planting etc.The negative aspects:- rather short, repitive gameplay- simple story (galaxy is dying - please help!)- lack of content: galaxies are basically the same - not much variation; towers don't have upgrades; boss fights don't require special tactics most of the timeResult (and summary for those who have no time reading):What a great and cute game cosmochoria is! Saving the galaxy and unlocking perks several times will make you spend hours ingame. If only there was more content, like additional galaxies, upgradable towers and more challenging boss fights!

Some be gotten evil has destroyed the galaxy and rid it of life. Your task is to hover over to each planet and plant seeds to restore life on said planets while at the same time fending off invaders and monsters.The monsters start of simple and easy to deal with but increase in difficulty and variety as time progresses (Or as your save more planets, im not particularly sure). Every now and then, a boss has a chance of spawning in an attempt to ruin you for good.The area you will be playing in is widely blank (It's space lol) save for a few planets here and there, big and small, which you will need to roam around to find, inhabit and restore. While it seems simple, floating in space combined with limitted jetpack fuel actually makes roaming space more lethal than it sounds since you would have to ration your fuel so you are not caught floating in space on an empty backpack towards the edge of the galaxy (Which causes death if that isnt obvious enough)There are collectibles and artifacts that you can gather and send to the ""Wise one"" to be examined (Which is basically a way of cashing in your found items to be used in your next playthrough or identifying what it does). Permanent Stat and character upgrades are also available with currency you collect while playing the game which improves your chance of survival each time you traverse the abyss. There's also artifacts in the game which you can activate to change the base game mode either making it easier (Enemies spawn less/do less damage) or harder (Less Jetpack fuel). Top that off with procedurally generated map layouts to the game and you've got yourself a good replay value game.Overall, the game is completely worth getting and trying out. For the price tag they put on the game (23RM for me), I would say it is actually a pretty good deal considering how well fleshed out the game is. A discounted price is like taking Bacon and Eggs and adding MORE BACON AND EGGS.Edit: I seem to have forgotten one other thing. Im fairly certain it's obvious enough but the game has a strong childish and cartoon like art style which some might like or not. Personally it gave it a more innocent and simple atmosphere. The game would look more serious and action oriented if it was painted in another way. Like imagine Risk of Rain's explosion, art and chaos in this game. Pretty sure it'd probably be less about saving planets and more about destroying them. (Would be interesting to see the Magma Worm here :D)"

,Recommended,293240,18569778,"Posted: 19 October, 2015",all,Hrulfyr,"Cosmochoria is a game where you heal planets void of all life because of a cataclysm that happened millions of years ago... while fighting off wave after wave of stuff that wants you dead.In many respects, this game is a rogue-lite. Permadeath, unlockables that can be used over multiple playthroughs, procedurally generated maps, etc.. However, unlike most rogue-likes, the difficulty comes mostly from personal choice. You can unlock artifacts by finding them in the game and having them identified. Half of the artifacts will decrease the difficulty in some way, like, for example, giving you the ability to instantly plant seeds, which is how you heal planets, or have less monsters on screen. The other half will increase your difficulty, like not allowing turrets, or no healing, which will essentially turn the game into a survival.The story is a nice addition, though not necessary to enjoy the game, and completely optional. You can learn about how the world came to an end by randomly generated messages on planets. The main issue I had with it is that there's a lot of nonsense in between the messages themselves, and while it does actually fit in to the story, it makes it a bit confusing to cope.When it comes to gameplay, you'll find yourself dying a few times at the beginning. The game has an upgrade/unlock system that you can only access when starting a game. There's a decent weapon variety once you have the currency to unlock it, and there's some costumes you can unlock in game for that added variety, all with their unique benefits.You might find that a session, once you get used to the combat and pace of the game, takes a long time. A run from start to finish would take 1-3 hours, which is why the game has a milestone system, which will place you after the defeat of each of the bosses.All in all the game is a good bit of fun. With a nice difficulty range, artstyle that's pleasant on the eyes, decent story, and fantastic soundtrack, I doubt you'd be disappointed."

It's lighthearted and one of those roguelikes that chooses to let you learn to play on your own rather than hold your hand - a sentiment that strikes me as particularly ironic considering that the protagonist starts as a spaceman in his underwear.Very enjoyable, albeit, somewhat short lived and singular in purpose.

It took me only two short games to figure out the majority of what I needed to do, and then I just had fun with it. The game really drew me in, and I spent over two hours playing it the first time--couldn't stop playing til I'd beaten the first boss and advanced somewhat substantially.Great graphics and sound effects. Also, the game runs well on my laptop from 2009 that's just above the minimum specs for this game. Slow to start (around 20 seconds with nothing happening), but I assume that that's probably my machine and/or that this will get fixed, as it's still in early access. The game ran smoothly, even on my 5+ year old laptop, for over two hours straight. No crashes, lagging, etc. even though it's still in early access.My main critique at the moment is that even though I was playing with my Xbox 360 controller (fully supported, great controls), the commands on the screen kept telling me to push keyboard S...would be helpful to map controls to avoid confusion.I'll update this review with more thoughts once I've played the game a bit more."
,Recommended,293240,14423098,"Posted: 10 February, 2015",all,Svartsjö,"[Updated Review for new content added]My initial impressions of this game were very positive. My current impressions of this game: still positive! This is a stylized, fun game, with very smooth controls, great artstyle, atmospheric music, ambiguous goals (I mean that in a positive way), and just enough addictive quality to keep you playing. The premise of this game is simple; relaxing, even. But what you'll soon fine is that this game can get quite hectic at times, making you go from ""ahh"" to ""AHH!"".This game is still in development, and with the newest update, you can tell it's further along the lines of ""completion"" than ""development"". There are lots of great components to this game, that at first felt a bit disjointed, but as it's getting updated, everything is blending in together nicely. So I'm confident that the finished product will feel as cohesive as the dev intends.So what is Cosmochoria? At a glance, you're a naked astronaut, terraforming - gliding from planet to planet, planting seeds and buildings and mapping out a very foreign universe. Baddies show up to stop you and you blast them away with your laser. However, as the game progresses, as you unlock more, you'll find that there's more depth to it than that. You're mapping out a universe. Dodging enemies while terraforming. And there's always the sense of an impending boss fight coming up. You have to balance offense and defensive tactics, depending on the situation. Sometimes enemies show up steadily, sometimes not at all, sometimes 4 pop up with no warning. Balancing that with what to build in that moment (plant or structure) keeps things fresh.Overall, the game is fun as is, but coming together nicely!My only minor gripes with the game, as of now, are that some of the power ups, feel a tad underpowered. And that sometimes getting hit will power down your gun.[Sugggestions]The power down aspect: I still think this is too punishing. Especially if it happens in the midst of a boss fight. I would suggest that the power down is timed to like... 30 seconds or so. This way, you're still punished for being hit, but you can also adapt to it. It makes fights more situational, and not as dire. Like, if I accidentally get powered down twice and a boss shows up, I know that I don't have much of a chance. However, if that happens but it's timed... I know I cna just run and hide for a bit or focus on dodging attacks and play more defensively until I'm back to full strength. It could add another layer to combat.Compass/Map: I LOVE this very necessary addition. Although I suspect it was here, pre-update, and I just never thought to click the compass in order to open the map. For familiar design sake, maybe the map can benefit from being in the top right corner - only because that's where it is almost every game, and I'm just used to glancing up/right to get my bearings. But this is a very very loose suggestion because I got used to it almost immediatelyMapping: This is another loose suggestion. The ability to name planets, or mark certain ones, would be beneficial. That way you can look at the map and get your bearings, or if you have to escape from danger you know to go to planet X because you remember putting turrets down there and such. It could really flesh out the universe map mechanic, and help the player feel like they're contributing more to really discovering/fixing this universe.Save feature: sometimes games go on longer than I'd like, but I'm really satisfied with my progress and don't want to suicide. On the other hand... that could be defeating the purpose behind the game concept. So take this suggestion lightly too."

But there are also animals/enemies attacking you, lots of them. When you planted enough seeds, the planet is filled with love! :D So you go on to the next one. The orange/red thingies that the enemies drop when you kill them, makes it possible to buy updates when starting a new game. You keep previous upgrades and also orange/red thingies. You don't keep the planets and other stuff you found. When you die, you have to search for planets and make planets happy again.I myself was sometime not even trying to plant seeds, because I had the feeling that at that moment, killing enemies was  better at that point, because it would give me more orange/red thingies to buy updates.You could also look on your map, to see where you are. Beware that outside the map, you will die. Also, when you're out of fuel, it's not possible to move anymore (you have to wait some time before it recharges). So it's best to only use fuel to change directions, that means you fly very slow, but, who cares? :)There are also things you find on planets, that you could deliver on another planet. I find this hard, because I was never able to discover all planets in one game. So.. It's hard to get the planet where you get something you have to deliver, and the planet where you have to deliver it, at the same time.. But still liking it.You have to find out yourself how everything works. At the moment, I have 4,4 hours played. But I still don't know what everything is. Especially the messages you see on some planets. But I'm gonna discover more and it will be fun!Also, I defeated one boss, but I'm not able to defeat the second, that would be hard to find out how to do that, too. It's so powerful!

At first glance, it looks cool, with some fun little mechanics, and an interesting idea behind it, but it's very poorly executed... It's not even close to being a complete game, and is a beta version, at best.The entire gameplay mechanic is landing on planets, holding the down key to plant a seed, which takes several seconds (even with upgrades... UGH), while pausing fairly often to shoot completely unchallenging enemies.  Repeat this several times per planet, and you get rewarded with a worthless item that you can carry (only one at a time) that has to be set down to build anything else... there is absolutley no reason you can't do both, it slows the game down even more.  After you plant many seeds, dependent on the planet's size, you ""heal"" it, and a chest pops up with either resources, or thost stupid do nothing items.You can blunder your way around space discovering new worlds, which is awful, because the minimap icon is very difficult to read, so often your course takes you off the map, and into the sun (certain death), and the map doesn't even display planet locations, just your x,y coordinates on a blank map... it's nearly worthless, and is, hands down, the worst map function I've ever seen in a game, which is made worse by the fact that you SORELY need it to navigate featureless open space.  Eventually you'll stumble upon less than a handful of worlds with important characters on them, such as the bearded man, who will tell you what those  awful items you've been lugging around one by one do (most SUCK), and if you're lucky, you'll find some teleporters that will enable you to bounce around between planets you've rescued, although there's literally no reason to ever return to them.The game starts off REALLY slow, since your planting speed is ridiculously slow, your defautl weapon atrocious, and your jetpack fuel limited... one of the least fun things I've ever encountered in a video game is having to blast off into space completely blind, then run out of jetpack fuel, and be left drifting aimlessly until it refills itself ever so slowly.Oh ,you collect shards or crystals or whatever from killing enemies, and can use them to pay for outrageously priced upgrades between game sessions, none of which even come close to lowering the monotony of gameplay.  I don't care if I could instantly colonize the planets, instantly find worlds, or hell, even had a minimap that served any function at all... this game still wouldn't be fun, even if you removed all the hinderances to gameplay, because there are no fun aspects to be enjoyed... GD, it REALLY is this bad, and it's a shame the cute graphics and nearly free price caused me to squander hours of my life only to be disappointed.Yeah, so this game has some potential, and is cute-looking, but I doubt it will ever be expanded into anything I would ever recommend to a friend... it's just a hair above what a high school student would make in an into to programming class.This is one of the most cruel reviews I've ever written, but I believe it to be fair.  Despite the game being almost free, I wish I had never encountered it, because the few hours I wasted playing it, hoping it would become enjoyable were for naught, and honestly, I'd have much preferred to have cleaned my room instead; at least there would have been a reward for the time wasted.  I'm so turned off by how poorly almost every concept was implemented, it would take a miracle for me to ever look at this game again, even with a massive update.  If this were posted on Newgrounds, you'd play it for 2 minutes, then never, ever try it again.  Frankly, I will never try another game from this team ever again, either."

Watch our review here on Steam Punks:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGLwR_WXMlQIt’s refreshing to see a chunk of new indie titles actually come off of Early Access lately. While that section of Steam has become somewhat of a wasteland for perpetually unfinished indie titles, a large amount of them have actually worked their way through to completion in recent months. One that may fly under a lot of radars is a small rogue-like platformer named Cosmochoria. Should you pay the low ticket price to shoot for the stars, or are you better off leaving the jetpack behind?The game is focused on rescuing planets by planting seeds and cultivating them while defending yourself from enemies, travelling from world to world with nothing but a ray gun, a jetpack, and your space helmet. The concept is novel at first; healed planets in turn grant you a partially replenished life bar, as well as a piece of treasure that can usually be exchanged for small gameplay modifications from the game’s only real story character, the old bearded alien. The elder also goes on to reveal pieces of the story for this universe upon completing each boss. The game doesn’t really take its own narrative seriously; holograms of some planets’ past residents are spread out to give some strange but humorous lines. The dialogue is typically pretty tongue-in-cheek, even the menu text doesn’t seem to care too much about its own story. With the amount of light-heartedness it’s difficult to take the story seriously at all as it’s slowly revealed to you. The galaxy was apparently destroyed by a great cataclysm, and reinvigorating planets and collecting pieces of a “one stone” is supposed to make it return once more so it may be extinguished.Cosmochoria is setup around rogue-like elements, when players die they can spend collected diamonds on upgrades like weapons, speed boosts, and equipment. The lack of tutorials is refreshing, as it gives you some time and space to discover every design aspect on your own. The game is essentially broken down into lives or runs. At first you’ll feel completely vulnerable to the cosmos with little in the way of defending yourself, but eventually you become strong enough to take on a large chunk of the galaxy at once. Sadly some upgrades fail to make the player actually feel powerful, which is a hugely important aspect in this kind of design. Very few buyable guns feel effective and the upgraded speed just makes maneuvers feel more jerky and hard to control.Ultimately progression feels like a bit of a grind, and as you get further it unfortunately only gets worse. Summoning bosses is done by rescuing a certain number of planets, though their appearance is random after you’ve completed the correct number. This means you could rescue 6 planets waiting for an enemy that should appear after 3. This problem halts the flow of the game immensely. Planting seeds and fertilizing them is probably the least interesting thing to do, and having to do a lot of it for no reason is a real blow to player morale. This all wouldn’t be such an issue if health wasn’t so vital in each run; the AI in this game is overwhelmingly centred upon rushing the player for contact damage. Often times we would die fighting off miscellaneous enemies waiting for the boss to arrive, only to restart the game and recoup our lost planet count. On more than one occasion we experienced game ending crashes due to what seemed to be attaining too high player speed, making purchasing speed boosts and entering portals to be a reluctant affair. Space exploration feels vast and intimidating at first, but this is quickly replaced with a sense of checking off a list once the map is purchased. Bricks can be collected and used to plant tower-defense style objects, though since these can be carried between runs you’ll constantly want to save these for something, and likely forget about them altogether. The colourful but plain art is cute and appealing, but to some it can be jarring in its simplicity. Music is suiting for the ambient spacey tone, although there can be some real ear piercers.It’s really too bad that there are so many problems to be found in Cosmochoria. There is something here to be appreciated, as the game captures a legitimate arcade feel and does so well to pay homage to Mario, Asteroids, and Space Invaders. It’s not a title that deserves to be completely skipped over, but it’s clear that this one may need some more time in the soil.SCORE: 6.5"

I mostly stand by what I've said. This is a bit more than a flash game, the developer is definitley DEVELOPING the game. The map is lovely, it's nice to see what places have already been settled. Also I'd say this game certainly has more merit as a casual game. Slowly progressing through the improvement system and going through the story, which admittedly I haven't had the patience to do, is likely a rewarding experience. I'd like to elaborate on the VERY SLOW part. RPG elements, and taking a long time to progress because you need upgrades is fine, I just don't prefer those sort of games. My problem with this game is building. Sitting still and planting for a couple seconds is just frusteratingly slow. If we could drop the seeds and watch them auto grow that would be much better. I recognize that may cause planets to get inhabited too quickly, but you could make the gameplay more interesting by growing plants being vulnerable to bullets.I will keep trying this game as it is updates. I like the how the developer treats his community, and I'd really like to change this reccomendation to a yes.~Zee"

There is easily another 20+ hours of trying to collect all the different unlockables.  The game is great fun.  The graphics are simple and yet very appealing and cohesive.  The object of the game.  You start out in a universe of 50 planets.  You start on one planet and your object is to bring the planey back to life by planting and growing plants.  You have a jet pack, so you can jet around and even leave the current planet and go to another planet.  You are free to go where you want in the universe.  If you try and leave the universe you will burn up.  Also, you only have so much jetpack juice so try and conserve it while out in space and not on a planet or you could be heading towards the areas where you burn up with no way out.  There are also monsters to avoid.  while you are planting and roaming the universe, there are bad guys trying to hurt you.  You need to kill them first. They will come when you are planting or building.  Yes building, there are buildings that do specific things.  Kinda like a tower defense on different planets.  You have to collect relics in order to build so you can't just go and build everything or you won't have anything left to build.  Also you can only fit so much on a given planet (planets come in different sizes) so build wisely.  Once you have planted enough trees the planet will be renewed and form an atmosphere.  There are also bosses.  The bosses are not too varied.  I think the first three bosses are basically the same thing but they shoot different types of bullets.  Still fun and challenging.  There are lots of upgrades you can purchase.  More recently with the upgrades, the game is pretty easy for the most part.  That is ok because the final boss is very difficult.Overall the game is a lot of fun and very addicting.  I highly recommend playing it."

If you like a challenge, floating lost around space, shooting aliens and growing plants, this is the game for you.The basic idea it to recreate a planets atmosphere by planting seeds and defending it from aliens. After you have restored a planet, that planet will repay you by giving you its heath so you (hopefully) save the next planet without dying.As well as planting seeds, you can build defences to automate your defence against the aliens and try to get through the storyline without dying. This game has no checkpoints, once you die, you die. I've never got past saving about 5 planets in one game, as I said, this game is HARD.So, in conclusion, if you don't mind restarting every time you die, and want to shoot aliens while planting trees to save planets, sure, get this game."

You are just one tiny little guy in the galaxy on your own saving each planet one at at time. All the while, aliens and dragons spawn and try to ruin your day. Go along and plant tree all over the place restoring the natural order only armed with a single gun.But don't let the gun throw you off, its far from an action game. This is probably more along the lines of casual with mild pressure.  I think it is meant to be challenge and impossible to do on your first time playing. You will have to sink a few hours into it before you make it really far, but believe me, you won't regret it.It's got subtle jokes to lighten the mood and the art is cartoony and playful. The achievements are written in lymerick which is another bonus that has a sinister taste of challenging the riddle solving for the regular achievement hunter. But don't worry, they are TOO hard if you are looking for them.The physics for the planets and space are nice and subtle but make a lot of sense; you have to escape the gravity of the planet and using the jetpack causes exponential accerlation. (I don't know why but I really like that part... it's cool)Oo! and the best part is the upgrades! the more and more you play and longer you survive, the more upgrades you can afford and rewards you can collect. Buy new guns, upgrade your suit and add perks to your character all with a currency you collect from beating the ever-loving crap out of your enemies.Line you score up against fellow players and discover the mysterious bearded owner of the 8-ball in Cosmochoria.

76561198053353751,Recommended,293240,34408701,Posted: 21 August,all,Science5,"This is such a beautiful little game. The classic arcade core with a botanical twist; the cartoony-cute art style; the tone-setting soundtrack that is memorable but unobtrusive, fun and sophisticated; the gentle humor balanced by some existential far-outness in story bits and easter eggs throughout the game—each of these elements is full of personality and together they help to define each other and the game as a whole, making Cosmochoria a unique experience that’s more than the sum of these parts.Most of the action involves you thrusting around from planet to planet Lunar-Landing-style, planting seeds and briefly nurturing plants while defending them from alien ambushes. When you succeed in healing that planet, you move on to another. Boss fights challenged me but weren’t depressingly frustrating. For me the game delivers something between casual play and old-school arcade grinding, leaning more towards casual.I liked the designer’s pacing choices. There are at least a few different satisfying endings and you probably won’t find all the hidden artifacts before you beat the game a few times. Artifacts alter certain elements of the game and can be selected or deselected before every session. Apart from that, you also have a running total of little triangular bits (common finds as you fight through alien hordes) that you can use to purchase permanent upgrades for you character stats, weapons, etc.The music is REALLY well done. All electronic and spacey, sometimes more ambient and other times more groovin, but in like an alien/cyborg kinda way. Perfect for cartoony space exploration. Interesting and awesome final boss theme music too—love how the composer manages to convey such a phat menacing feel in a cartoony way.This is not just a cute lil game that’s fun to play casually and hard to put down; it’s a creative work with a playful heart and funky soul."
