Many adventures are behind a paywall. The visuals are unique and very transparent. The gameplay is interesting but may become boring quickly. I can recommend playing it for a bit, but not as a long term time investment."

The metagame story is fun and interesting.  Felt like the 1980s...Cons:  The micropayment cash grab is gross.  You can play free for @30hrs, then you need to start buying access.Also: this game is a _very cheap_ strat game, with minimalist card building elements.If you want to feel the nostalgia - play for free.  Any other reason should be a pass.I give it a thumbs up BARELY and only for the story and feels.  The game is a grind - barely entertaining."

Best of all, it's free, and its microtransactions aren't necessary to win the game.GameplayIfDungeons & Dragonswere played as a board game with decks of cards to resolve combat, the result would beCard Hunter. The gear that your characters equip determine what cards go in their deck. At the start of each encounter, your party of characters and their enemies are deployed on the board, and each of them is given a hand of cards from their deck. The player and the Game Master alternate playing a card from their hands to move across the board, execute a melee attack, or cast spells. When both of them pass without playing any card, the turn ends. If there are any hands with more than two cards, these must be discarded down to two, and two new cards are drawn from their respective decks to form a new set of hands. Play continues until the player or the Game Master attains their victory condition.There is no perma-death in this game, so even if your entire party gets killed, you can always start over with the same party if you want to.My EvaluationUsing cards instead of dice to resolve actions is nothing short of brilliant. This game mechanic adds a level of planning that would not be possible with dice alone. If you enjoy turn-based tactical combat in a D&D-like setting,Card Huntermay be for you. This game doesn't come with an emotionally engaging story (not that you should expect one), but you may appreciate the geek humor that this game has in spades.Note thatCard Hunterhas microtransactions, but they really aren't necessary to win. Over all, I find the developer's business model to be fair and well worth supporting."
,Recommended,293260,29674261,Posted: 3 February,all,RacePace,I beat the game way before it was released on Steam. It's a f2p board-game that's similar to Dungeons and Dragons. It's surprisingly addictive too. Highly recommended if you're into that type of games.

The pvp on the higher levels would require to have better cards, but it's farmable if you are willing to put the time in."

Save yourselves the frustration and just play Tetris instead, at least you'll get some bars."

76561198345568220,Recommended,293260,29596636,Posted: 30 January,all,Old Master,"If you have ever enjoyed playing a table-top fantasy game then I would definitely suggest giving this game a try. It is very nostalgic to the early days of AD&D and full of adolescent sibling rivalry and nerd humor. The interplay between card use and the figures on the map is very well thought out. Like any game there can be some mini-maxing going on, but, if you want to play the game for fun, then there is a lot of fun variation that can go on. The game has single player, cooperative, and player versus player modes. And, yeah, regardless of how well you make a deck of cards for your character, board tactics, and the-luck-of-the-draw can make or break a scenario or match, but that’s part of what makes this game fun and challenging."

Its a TBS that puts you in a world where the game is a board game and the game has board game vibes.You play as yourself and you pick 3 characters to play, Warrior, Mage, Monk and 3 races, elf, dwarf and human.Each Race is better suited for a certain role, Elf is good for magic, human for monk and dwarf for warrior.Its a solid game with each dungeon/map/board completed (which may have 3 or so stages) rewarding you with items and money. It features a huge selection of gear, to max health give you new cards and things. Its not P2w, even though i haven't seen any PvP (if there is) and even if you don't get The legendaryCardboard Shield and Larp swordGear you may be able to buy it off others."

Turn based, play a card each turn for an action, move, fight the bad guys, get loot, equip your characters, level up, good fun. Really like the way different items give you different combos of cards for your build creating an agony of choice. Just wish the optional membership was a bit cheaper but they deserve the odd payment now and again for the good work they've done."
