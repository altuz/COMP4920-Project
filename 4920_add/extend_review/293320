I take time to look at every crany and it could use more scare. The story is amusing enough but needs more atmosphere and better graphics. I would not recommend this for more than $5 though. It is about $0-$5 worth so about $2.50. There are other free games simular to this that offer more such as SCP Containment Breach.

Seemed like they were going for more of an experimental narrative type game than an actual horror-type game. You spend the majority of the game walking very slowly through tunnels without a real purpose except to flip the occasional lever or two. The one action scene they give you comes out of nowhere and it is extremely lack-luster.One thing I actually did like about the game was the story and I would definitely read a book about this game. Only problem is that it would be better than the actual game was...Coma earns from me a 1/5. Please do not spend your hard-earned six dollars on this game...

With this first part, which is supposed to act like an intro of sorts, they brought me from sceptical (I bought it on a sale so I paid almost nothing at all - so I didn't expect anything really), to underwhelmed, to a bit intrigued, back down to underwhelmed and landed on sceptical.If they put in more effort on the coming episodes, especially when it comes to character models and the AI, then I think it will be at least worth a purchase. As this episode stands, I would not recommend it to the general public - but I _would_ recommend it to horror lovers and people with a genuine interest of games of this type. The atmosphere is absolutely nailed at some parts, while it's completely ruined at others.If I were to give it one of those oneliner judgements, I'd say ""barely passable"".

A game about death! Sounds interesting.Ok so, I got this game for 50 cents or something and I really wanted to like it...Unfortunately, this game is, as many people pointed out before me, a walking simulator. Yes, there is some very basic fun to be had but, in the end, this game managed to bore me to... DEATH (heh)!Anyways, you play as a nameless guy who lost his girlfriend. He decides to commit suicide, but finds himself trapped in a bizarre world. Sounds interesting, right? Unfortunately, nothing really delivers. Everything starts off intriguing, but after a couple of areas, you realize what you are in for - a snooze-fest. The game doesn't really have an ending because it was meant to be a trilogy, so you're pretty much playing a third of a game.Gameplay is trash. You can walk slowly or walk... Slower... I am serious. I pressed shift to run and the character walked even slower - the fastest walking speed is painfully tedious and, considering the game has a few parts where you need to backtrack, this was even more annoying. I get it, walking CAN build tension but in this case... Frustration ensued.You can also interact with levers but it's all really easy and dumb. The ""puzzles"" require a certain lever sequence to be solved but you can't even press the wrong lever or anything, you just need to find the one that can be pulled and you're done.There's a part towards the end that allows you to run - it comes out of nowhere and the soundtrack turns into a heavy metal cacophony that left me ""WTF"".Voice acting is serviceable but the guy goes on and on about some nonsense about ""the place"" he is in. I mean, I'm all for a deep understanding of death and hidden meanings but this bordered on ridiculous. Also, there are a lot of parts where the character is quiet and the only thing you can hear is your footsteps - yet again, not scary , boring.""Coma: Mortuary"" looks really good. Even though the flashlight effect only works close to the character, the game world had an ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"" feel to it and everything looked better than expected.So yeah, a cheap, hour long game with pretty graphics, where nothing else works.Do I recommend it? No. I'm sort of easily scared by games and I didn't even flinch once with this one.Final Score: 3 out of 10."

The game's genre is adventure-ambient with horror-quest element. The narration of a plot is done through a subtitles and an atmosphere.Gameplay.Coma: Mortuarycould be a much better game than this. So much potential for nothing. The beginning cutscene was interesting to me, however, the motion blur throughout the game is uncomfortable to look at. This game is a post-death experience with an interesting atmosphere, in which you'll play as a nameless guy who lost his girlfriend. He decides to commit suicide, but finds himself trapped in a strange world surrounded by deads (mummies appear), and dead people that appear and disappear. You have a flashlight to guide you in the darkness. Yes, it sounds interesting but it's a trash.The voice acting is bad and becomes very annoying as the game progresses. ""Enemies"" pop up from thin air, the game takes control over when it wants, there's no interaction although the game will prompt you to press E, and in almost 9 hours I don't understand for what. The soundtrack turns into a heavy metal, even gave to laugh. Reminds me the soundtrack of horror british movies ""28 Days Later...""/""28 Months Later"". No sense. Adding to this, the map is basically the same over and over, you always walking on squares. The brief intro promises so much and after, the game is a waste of time.The gameplay is so bad, how it's possible. The only two actions you can do is walk and look around. First, the character walks so slow that it becomes frustrating. Not worth clicking on shift, it will not make any difference. Second, how can I move above the water? This sounds too bad. For last, I didn't realize how I died in all of times that I played. But as I walk so slowly, it was hard to escape from death. A real mystery. This game could be a very weak version ofAmnesia. And if it worth €5,99, is a joke.Positive points. (+)The concept is interesting, but very poorly implemented.Decent visuals.Negative points. (-)Too expensive (the price is a joke).The speed you can walk is just terrible.Mediocre narration/voice acting.Strange gameplay (how can I move above the water, is just stupid).The map is basically all the same over and over (you'll always walking on squares).The camera isn't good.The soundtrack is based in heavy metal, there is no sense. Reminds me the soundtrack of horror british movies ""28 Days Later...""/""28 Months Later"".What ending is this? I know that's a triology, but continues to be disappointing.There is no real sense in what happens in this game.It's not scary or close to that, at all.Very weak version ofAmnesia."

It has nice sound, also.- One can never walk any faster than a speed slightly above GLACIAL in The Land Of The Dead, except perhaps when being ""chased"" by things popping up (but not necessarily moving towards you) in corridors and doorways.  Water provides an even greater obstacle to one's movement, thereby proving the old adage that ""blood is thicker than water"" COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY INCORRECT (mind you, I didn't get to walk through any blood in the course of the game, so perhaps I'm just jumping to conclusions).  For those who can't handle the break-neck pace, however, there is fortunately the option to press Left Shift and slow yourself down even FURTHER.- There are lots of dead-ends in The Land Of The Dead.  Which take ♥♥♥♥ING AGES to back-track from, for reasons listed directly above.- Every visitor to The Land Of The Dead is helpfully supplied with a FLASHLIGHT (it is pretty dark, after all).- There are lots of levers and cranks in The Land Of The Dead, used to open doors and so forth.  These levers won't necessarily be close to each other OR the portal one is using them to traverse through.  In other words, bring a packed lunch if you plan on trying to get through any doors in The Land Of The Dead.- The Land Of The Dead comes complete with mediocrely-acted narration, in some desperate attempt to recreate the atmosphere of Dear Esther, only in a far less linear environment with far less clues as to where exactly you're supposed to go next.  Again, a packed lunch (and, perhaps, dinner) is advised; you may also wish to borrow a saint's halo to make the journey slightly less agonizing on the whole.- There are a lot of ""first-person"" cut scenes in The Land Of The Dead, all of which are directed by a very nervous person with a twitchy mouse hand who can't pan around smoothly.- There is death metal music in The Land Of The Dead, but only at highly inappropriate times, such as when one is being chased down corridors by witchy ghost women who look like cardboard cut-outs.  Or witnessing end credit sequences which are as unskippable as the game is now unleavable, except by way of forcefully shutting one's computer down.- Lastly but not leastly, The Land Of The Dead apparently comes in three parts.  Here's hoping the next two are at least slightly better, and FREE to all of us who who were kind enough to give the developers money for THIS barely passable excuse for a ""game"".  ONLY RECOMMENDED WHEN DIRT-CHEAP IN A SALE, AND ONLY FOR THOSE OF US SO ADDICTED TO HORROR GAMES THAT WE'LL PLAY JUST ABOUT ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING.Verdict: 5.5/10."

Here are the pros and cons, if you want the TLDR, it's the last paragraph.Pros:Story - It was kind of hard to follow the story, however I found the story quite enjoyable.Models - Some static models are okay and don't stand out too much.Ambient Occlusion - This was one of the things that made the visuals bareble, because it sure wasn't the textures, shadows or even shaders.Cons:Voice Acting - The actor pauses on nearly every word like they had an audio file for each one and couldn't produce the audio or edit it at all.Flashlight Delay - If you accidentally turn your flash off, you can't instantaneously turn it on again, there is a delay and it's not good.Sound Quality - The quality of the sound feels the music went through the shredder before being implemented into the game.Music - The rocky'ish music which comes around when you are randomly being chased, is awful for this theme of a game.Graphics - Although it says high on mine, it doesn't feel like it.Walking - Footstep sounds still play even if your walking into a wall or a blocked entity.Process - The game isn't 64-bit (seriously like wtf).Textures - Some textures seem to be high quality and then some are really low, it seems they didn't have a house-style sheet for their texturing ""yeah let's do 1024x1024 and then for these just do 128x128 or something...""Models - A few models are really bad, such as the dead body models.Model Animations - All they do is wiggle and that's it, the first encounter of an AI (sort of) is when a dead'ish body is wiggling on the floor like a fish out of water, it was hillarious rather than scary.Animations - The intro animations were in 30fps, seriously man.Transitions - Fading, seriously it's not ♥♥♥♥ing powerpoint.Text - Why in god's name would you have pixeled text and normal text merged together, it destroys the theme.Clipping - The clipping in the game isn't as advanced as you would want it to be, most of the time you will see your self popping down and up on rough terrain which should be smoother.Water - I don't mind walking on water but do we really have to have -5 billion % slow or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ like damn.Sprinting - No sprinting, wtf why is there no sprint.Death - From time to time you will see yourself in the death screen, and most of the time you won't know what you died from.I will rate this a 4/10, it's only worth on sale. The only thing I found interesting was the story and the only visually pleasing things were Ambient Occlusion and the Models. Other than that it was garbage, it isn't worth it's price unless it had a huge update fixing these problems. And you know what's funny, I managed to find all of these cons and few pros just in half-an-hour. Easy to spot and still not fixed and or changed."

It gives you no reason why or direction to what your supposed to be doing. Which basically consists of walking around aimlessly down corridor after corridor pulling the odd lever every now and then. The monotone mutterings of the narrator about angels and demons doesnt help matters either making you care even less about the supposed story. Also there are no puzzle elements here, you are simply trying to find the exit to the cut-and-paste surroundings. The movement speed also has to be mentioned as your character moves so damn slow. Which I can only think was purposely put in to extend what is already a short experience.The only redeeming qualities are the graphics and sound design, which aren't too bad at all. Although the death-metal style choice for the one short chase scene seems SO out of place.Overall very disappointing and I can't recommend this no matter the price. Hopefully the other episodes are more entertaining."

Basically you walk slowly(or extra slowly if you hold shift) through pretty repetitive and uninteresting rooms for 90% of the game occasionally solving simple/tedious find all the switches style puzzles. There are two segments during which you are forced to run which are somewhat tense but the rest of the time you are just walking slowly with the occasional loud noise scare popping up. While you are trying to enjoy your walking simulator you recieve the story in a pretty monotone narration that is very vague/nonsensical at times. I was really expecting this to be a Dear Esther clone, but it doesn't even deserve to be compared to that game.One of the main issues I have with this game is the immersion. In a game like this atmosphere is everything and a big part of that is being in control and experiencing everythging first hand. However repeatedly the game takes control of the camera and completely breaks the mood. The best example of this is  the cage scene in the trailer featured on the store page(that scene which appeared to be interactive was half the reason i bought the game), That whole segment is a  cutscene though you have no control whatsoever on the cage comes down even though the trailer makes it appear that way. It also doesn't help that there are a mind numbingly large amount of dead ends / repetitive empty rooms that you have to go through. There is also a surprisingly small amount of detail given to each are sure there were a couple of areas which appeared interesting but for the most part the enviornment was very bland.Finally the cherry on the pie is the game is a whole 40 minutes to an hour long. I came in at 60 minutes on the dot and that was after dying repeatedly and having the game crash to desktop 30 minutes in. It also ends rather abruptly with a cliffhanger that will lead into part 2 if it is ever made."

It doesn't appear to have any direct action (i.e. fighting and interaction is minimal), it doesn't really have puzzzles in the traditional sense... But what it does have is a Gothic chic like me's dream atmosphere! Creepy stone worked and long dark hallways, strange scurrying in the blackened corners, dripping moss, ancient angel statues, even giant centipedes!!!!! What girl could ask for more?  And, best of all, one has a chance to basically explore The Land of the Dead. Very cool!! Throw in an excellent, mostly Ambient soundtrack (one Black Metal sounding song does play too at one point but other than that, all Ambient), and Viola!  You have a very dark and almost fable like tale. I say 'fabel' as it has a moral message, not an annoying one, but one which makes one think of ones life. It does have an issue with ending too soon and I think this is because it was intended to be a two part game. I do not know if the devlopers are working on Part 2, but I truly hope they are. It is a graveyard rich, dark, and spooky explorer horror game is how I would assign a genre to this game. To top it off, it has a cool tale which the main character (you) tells as you walk through this dark world, which I greatly enjoyed. Definitely worth a look for horror fans like me~ 8.5/10For basic game play, graphics, and storyline. To be honest, I love this game but I am frustrated it does not appear to have it's part 2 yet. It is a bit like only reading half a good novel. So 8.5, not 10."
,Recommended,293320,23551571,"Posted: 14 June, 2016",all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"Coma: Mortuary is an indie horror walking simulator, developed by N A GA Entertainment and published by Nova Dimension. This title is the first of a trilogy, and it places you in the shoes of a nameless male who, one fateful night, got drunk and crashed his car in a suicide attempt. The man survives, but falls into a deep coma, and that is where this story begins.There is nothing exactly scary about this title, it's simply a darker walking simulator than what most people are used to. The man that you play as, and who also narrates the entire gaming experience, has no idea that he is in a coma. Instead, he fully believes himself to be in a sort of limbo/purgatory area after death, awaiting judgment for his sins. As you begin walking, well voice acted narration will play at various intervals to further explain this chapter of the story. The story itself is very well written, and the person that wrote it devoted a lot of attention to detail.You may be surprised at just how well optimized Coma: Mortuary is, the game plays at a flawless 60 FPS for its entire hour-long duration. The only issue that I had while playing the game, was that it would crash any time I attempted to place it in full screen mode. I navigated around this slight annoyance by setting the screen resolution to 1080, and keeping it in windowed mode. Other users have reported bugs and crashes, but I did not experience any issues other than the aforementioned.The game also has a brilliant soundtrack, one that's still ringing in my head some hours after I've finished playing. These tracks typically begin playing when you're pressed to be in a rush to run away or solve a puzzle, and it would've been nice if they played during the normal walking sections. The puzzles themselves are very straightforward and easy to solve, and they either include simply hitting levers or running away from an enemy. There are a few ways to die, though luckily the title is very generous with its checkpoints.There are only a few minor gripes that I can accumulate in regard to Coma: Mortuary. The main one is that at various intervals, the game has this terrible distortion/blur effect happening; this is usually when your character is rattled or has been traumatized. I understand the reasoning for the effect, but it is extremely distracting and takes away from the game. It's also quite irritating to constantly hear a pencil scribbling every time that the narrative comes on. Lastly, I will also be like the numerous other reviewers and say that the walking speed is abhorrent; it's excruciatingly slow.Other than those three things, Coma: Mortuary is actually a really solid atmospheric walking simulator. It's unfortunate that it is so short, but the good news is that there should be two more installments in this series on the way. The story, optimization, graphics, and soundtrack are excellent for the price point. I've played far, far worse, and it surprises me that this game has such a bad rating on Steam.Rating:4.0/5.0- Excellent, highly worth playing.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

It looked very atmospheric and had an interesting concept, and it still does, but unfortunately it falls flat. The game looks great and is very unsettling, giving you feelings of despair and loneliness. It makes you feel like something is going to get you at any moment. The game also had a interesting concept or idea around the story, that death affects more than those who die, that one death can affect and hurt many people. While I loved the idea behind the story, the game ended up disappointing me for a few reasons. Mainly because its short, its badly paced, and this game was supposed to have sequels, but they never came out, so the story is unfinished. It also had some bad design choices, like blaring rock/metal music during a chase scene, that just killed the atmosphere in my opinion. I also had a problem where after I died from an enemy (the only enemy) I was stuck moving slowly, so there was no way I could finish the game, without restarting it completely, because she would just kill me over and over again.I posted a video about my thoughts here if you are interestedhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMyXVmkur-4Overall, it starts off nice, but it disappoints.

Cavernous atriums, abandoned but still torchlit temples, stone passages that feel both decrepit and powerful; it's a serious and successful attempt at designing a place for primeval gods, or maybe the remnants of the first great age of their progeny. The game is definitely a walking sim, and a creepy one, but it's one of those few that feels like it's doing anything right.I'd give it a 2/2.

While this clearly is a walking simulator (as advertised!) with little actual interaction with our environment and no actual riddles or difficult tasks, the game still convinces with its great execution and intriguing ideas of what might happen after death and why.In my opinion, the price is a little too high for the 1 hour of gameplay this game brings, but if bought on sale, the game is very much worth it.For anyone interested, find my full playthrough here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOKYiYMV40w"

And that's just the first of this game's problems...Unimaginative and unoriginal story, voice acting that sounds phoned-in both figuratively and literally, unimpressive sound design, graphics that would have looked shoddy a decade ago (despite the game proudly telling you it was made in Unreal), overly-long death and restart sequences, and as far as I saw, no puzzle solving beyond pulling levers to open doors. A walking simulator in every sense of the word, and even among that dismal genre, this is one of the worst I've seen. Like a bargain basement Dear Esther, as if we needed an even worse version of that.I prefer to be lenient to a developer when it's their first attempt, but I cannot think of anything to praise this game on. This is a total waste of money, even when it's on sale. There's plenty of other better games you could buy for less."

The main character has a lot of knowledge that doesn't really make sense for him to have, and it comes out of nowhere when he initially starts to talk about it. Other than that, here's a quick summary of the good and bad:(Maybe spoilers? I don't know.)Good ThingsI guess the music's okay, if a bit generic.Those horizontal spike gates are pretty cool.The first chase scene is hilarious.Bad ThingsIf there was a way to turn off the motion blur that happens while you walk, I couldn't see it.So, if you get motion sick, I would doubly suggest you avoid this game.The walking speed can be best described as ""about the same as a geriatric snail,"" which is obviously an issue for a game where all you ever really do is walk. (Sometimes pressing shift makes youslow down even further,if you're into that.)There's no reason to go anywhere other than forward. There's no lore to find, no jump scares to see, no interesting sights to take in... nothing.The game tells you that ""light guides the way"" and it does! ... except when itdoesn't!Hope you like climbing up flights of stairs or walking down paths that don't actually lead anywhere only to realize you have to double back again, because you will. And that's always fun when you go the pace of a speeding baby, isn't it?At times, you have to hammer down on the action key to get something to work. (In one room, no matter how hard I tried, I was unable to get the game to let me read some books, despite having a prompt to do it.)The puzzles are boring and make you backtrack a lot. Sometimes the game doesn't make it clear that you've even done anything useful until the final part of a lever-pulling marathon.After a bit of heavy-handed foreshadowing by Mr. Narrator, there's a chase sequence where you can actually die. This is out of nowhere because, earlier in the game, you go through a sequence where you can just slowly walk away from some menacing cardboard cutouts while comically energetic music plays in the background.After being attacked by a ghost and looking at the game over screen, I realized that I had no desire to try again. While the concepts that the narrator explored were interesting, the execution is very poor, so I never felt all that invested in any of it. It's a shame, really. I wanted to know who the plague doctor dude on the loading screen was.I think I got this on sale, but I regret having spent money on it at all. Don't waste yours."

This is one of the few games that has appropriately used jump scares and managed to form chase scenes that go on for the perfect length of time – you don’t get away too easily, but you’re also not running for so long or regularly that you’re bored.I have a few issues with this game, however. One of which is that you cannot run or even jog at will, which makes the game feel like it is dragging at times. Even a slightly faster walk that the player can use would help prevent this feeling of drag. Additionally, the puzzles were less “use your brain” and more “Does the hand appear when I hover over this?”. Finally, after the credits there is a sequence of rolling down a corridor, interlaced with scenes from the game (With added footsteps), so you feel like it might build up to something. Has the game ended? Is there another scene? No. It just loops. It doesn’t build up to anything and it doesn’t end, which ruined the end of the game for me when I was waiting for it to take me back to the menu screen (as most games do when they are done). So just be aware of that.But overall I did really like this game and I would recommend it.If you want to see a bit of game play to consider buying it for yourself, I have linked my playthrough of this below.https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcN6cXpQDyhfiwsqgcqrhn8cjoVOyNSyY"

Boring. Full of padding. Abandonned episodic.Non stop lore-dump while going through boring corridors. As if they only had a few ideas for locations and they just cut down your walking speed and expanded the corridors. Additionally they reduced on-screen visibility and there is a short distance draw. Along with the constant re-use of assets this makes the game absolutely disorienting, very easy to get turned around and go in circles forever. Game ends very aprutly as the story just starts getting established. There is no real connection between the level design and the narration of the lore. Gameplay just involves shifting levers and going down correct doors. Might be a few jumpscares here and there but those are rather rare and not very scary. Game obviously hints at more content so either this game is unfinished or it is abandonned episodic format but aside from the concept for the game the execution itself was no fun and I am removing it for declutter."

This game is similar to Dear Esther in that there is minimal interaction with the environment and a heavy focus on story telling and atmosphere.  It's engaging and fairly well written and the voice actor does a good job at reading his lines.  Ignore the reviews complaining about how it's not a game because of vague reasons that don't make sense.  It's short and fairly slow paced but you're meant to soak in the atmosphere and environment.One thing I will suggest is forcing VSync through your video card drivers or some other means.

,Recommended,293320,13847387,"Posted: 5 January, 2015",all,RealSpooky22,"Worth the £0.79 I paid, wouldn't touch it at full price though. You're looking at about 70-90 minutes (depending on how much you have to backtrack/explore). Only died twice, and neither one felt unfair. Story-wise, it's a bit convoluted (hoping the other games expand more) and the ending seems totally detached from the rest of the game. You do walk very, VERY slowly, and there is no ""combat"" or anything, so the walking simulator tag is accurate. Some jump scares are pretty odd, but for the most part the scares are more of a panic inducing type of deal than a straight up surprise. That said, this game isn't Amnesia/Outlast. Don't expect hours of tension building. It's usually just short, sweet segments that see you break your usual plod in favour of an surprisingly fast run.I did enjoy it for several reasons, namely that it's an interesting enough premise and the locations are pretty neat (if a bit beige). It's also one of the very few games that uses actual death metal songs. I actually burst out laughing at one point where they used it, as it comes outta nowhere and is by far the heaviest song in the game, but I like metal so it was enjoyable none the less. Some art was laughably awful, as in literally a 2D jpeg, but for the most part it matched the rest of the game.Overall 6/10Recommended ON SALE."

A game about death! Sounds interesting.Ok so, I got this game for 50 cents or something and I really wanted to like it...Unfortunately, this game is, as many people pointed out before me, a walking simulator. Yes, there is some very basic fun to be had but, in the end, this game managed to bore me to... DEATH (heh)!Anyways, you play as a nameless guy who lost his girlfriend. He decides to commit suicide, but finds himself trapped in a bizarre world. Sounds interesting, right? Unfortunately, nothing really delivers. Everything starts off intriguing, but after a couple of areas, you realize what you are in for - a snooze-fest. The game doesn't really have an ending because it was meant to be a trilogy, so you're pretty much playing a third of a game.Gameplay is trash. You can walk slowly or walk... Slower... I am serious. I pressed shift to run and the character walked even slower - the fastest walking speed is painfully tedious and, considering the game has a few parts where you need to backtrack, this was even more annoying. I get it, walking CAN build tension but in this case... Frustration ensued.You can also interact with levers but it's all really easy and dumb. The ""puzzles"" require a certain lever sequence to be solved but you can't even press the wrong lever or anything, you just need to find the one that can be pulled and you're done.There's a part towards the end that allows you to run - it comes out of nowhere and the soundtrack turns into a heavy metal cacophony that left me ""WTF"".Voice acting is serviceable but the guy goes on and on about some nonsense about ""the place"" he is in. I mean, I'm all for a deep understanding of death and hidden meanings but this bordered on ridiculous. Also, there are a lot of parts where the character is quiet and the only thing you can hear is your footsteps - yet again, not scary , boring.""Coma: Mortuary"" looks really good. Even though the flashlight effect only works close to the character, the game world had an ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"" feel to it and everything looked better than expected.So yeah, a cheap, hour long game with pretty graphics, where nothing else works.Do I recommend it? No. I'm sort of easily scared by games and I didn't even flinch once with this one.Final Score: 3 out of 10.I am exactly his opinion.."

As a fan of horror-games in the style of ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"" and ""Outlast"", this game seemed nice enough to buy.However, I read a couple of reviews before purchasing it (and most of them were negative), but I decided to give it my own opinion.First of all, this game is not very unique. It felt very familiar to play, since it features a well-used concept; exploring dark and haunting surroundings through a first-person perspective. I was almost immediately reminded of two other Indie-games that uses the same style of story-telling and progression: ""Dear Esther"" and - as said before - Amnesia: The Dark Descent.However, don't expect any interesting or mind-blowing puzzles in this game. There are some ""puzzles"", although I wouldn't really want to call them puzzles, due to their simplicity.The mechanics are simple and the only thing required by the player is basically walking and listening, with the occasional interraction with objects in the world.Although I listened to everything, I didn't find the story very interesting and soon lost interest.For being the first part in an intended trilogy, I think the developers made a mistake by not giving the story more time and focus.To be fair, I suppose the story will flesh out and get more interesting in the following parts, but it would had been a smarter move to get the player properly introduced and not just scratch on the surface.The developers of the game has also stated that the length of the game - I completed it in little more than an hour (including some Googling) - was due to the fact of it being an introduction, but I still think some more could have been done.Also, for being a horror-themed game, I didn't find this game to be that much of a scare at all.Sure, there was one jump-scare that got the best of me (+ a stressing sequence at the end), but overall this game failed to be scare me.In the end - even though this game does have some of negative sides - I decided to give it a thumbs up.Considering what you get as a player, the price of 0,99 Euros is completely reasonable and there is no need to wait for a sale in the case of this game (unless one is really mingy!).I recommend this game to people who enjoy the horror-genre and who are willing to wait for the upcoming second and third installments (which are hopefully better and more enjoyable)."

I liked the aesthetics of certain areas; medieval stone interiors, candelabrum, viking long boat wrecks and so on. Ambients sounds such as creepy moaning and whispering and so on were good. There was no gamma slider (and I didn’t bother looking at the settings on my screen) which might have been handy to get a true black for the shadows. They were often greyish. Also some of the figures I encountered were actually 2 dimensional.You walk slowly through the dark environment (I forgot that I had a torch for like the first half an hour). You can’t run even if you are trying to escape scary looking figures. Occasionally the protagonist has dialogue which helps with the pacing of slow sections. Occasionally you have to pull levers. One section had a series of them in different rooms. If it was meant to be a puzzle it wasn’t very challenging. Maybe thing’s are more complicated further into the game?I actually got a few spooks from this game. Typical sort of stuff. Shadowy figures suddenly appearing and surrounding you, people sealed inside body bags writhing around and suddenly disappearing. You can die in this game. Seems to be when you take the wrong route the game will fade to black you will hear some sounds then you are dead. It isn’t entirely clear which route will be fatal so I had to basically rely on trial and error.It was fun. I like the environment. I wanted to keep playing.

At 90% off, and playing in the dark at night, it was worth a couple of shivers.It runs very smoothly on the Unreal3 engine for me, nice enough to look at, it has no atrocious mouse acceleration, but horrible motion blur that you cannot toggle off specifically, and is activated whenever you start walking or move the mouse to look around. The subtitles font seems to be tailored to resolutions higher than 1280 by xxxx, because it's barely readable at that screen resolution.Fans of the genre were able to make connections to things that this might be inspired by. Sadly, I cannot. And as such, I approached the story open-minded. It didn't really make all to much sense to be, until I thought about it, and tried to make connections. It's a really abstract place you find yourself in, a pipe dream of a mind in a coma perhaps.You have to decide what games to play but personally, I wouldn't recommend it at full price, or to people who are not fans of this genre. It really is a short and narrated walking simulator most of the time, and when it isn't, it's a trial and error run for your life that is not too hard to figure out though."

Short despite its slow pace, Coma is somehow equal parts forgettable and irritating. You basically walk along a set path with very little diversity, occasionally to the sound of an unenthusiastic narrator reading out what the game decided to call the story, and then you have to escape an enemy by navigating a maze. And that's about it, roll credits. The graphics are acceptable, if bland, and the couple of jump scares tossed in only serve to keep you from entirely falling asleep. I will commend the game for establishing a decent atmosphere, but atmosphere without substance doesn't do much.

Thankfully I accidentally hit the T key at one point and it opened up a console prompt. Typing things into the ""say"" command makes a robot voice say that text aloud, and I found this to be the least boring thing in the entire game. When I experimented a bit in that prompt I discovered a ""fly"" command that made me move slightly faster, and this cut down on the annoyance factor but I can hardly call that a feature as it's not supposed to happen. All in all, Coma: Mortuary is a prime example of a game company giving you as little as physically possible, wrapped in a pretty shell and trying to ride the coat tails of other, somehow better walking simulators. Save that 50 cents. You'd get more overall entertainment value out of throwing two quarters into a fountain."

(Cuz the introduction says that there will be 2 more to form a trilogy.)After beat the game, I have a bunch of questions about the plot. However, I don't think the developers can answer 'em all in the following episodes. The plot seems only causing confusions. If it is designated, I congratulate its sucess upon me. But if it is not, this game (Currently I only refer this episode) is better to provide free admission.Moreover, gaming experience is not so good. and reasons are the following:1. Moving speed is TOOOOOOOO SLOW!No running option, moderate speed when moving, which cost me half an hour more to beat the 1-hour long game.2. Can't use flashlight when playing with controller.Minor problem, but causes a lot of inconvenience.3.Setting menu is messy.What you can change is too few and some options just stuck together when you open them 1-by-1."

Then i got to a certain area where the game broke and i couldn't proceed. What did it was I got to a simple puzzle where i was supposed to pull some levers, and for some reason the game wouldn't let me pull this one that i needed to proceed. I even looked up 3 different walkthroughs to see if I was doing it right and all 3 walkthroughs were the same. I tried restarting the game multiple times and kept getting stuck. It's a real shame because i really enjoyed the atmosphere, and was genuinely creeped out at some points. This game also has an amazing soundtrack. But whats the point of all that if the game was broken and i can't proceed? If i can find a solution i'll change my tone about this game, but for now i can't recommend it based on my experience with it. It's obvious that other players have managed to beat this. so hopefully i can find a way to fix this."

Walk slowly or even more slowly. Every now and then you see something. Or die if you walk in to the dark, out of no reason. You can pull levers and you have to visit certain place to unblock your way but that's about all. You look around and admire the places. You can't  crouch, you can't jump, you can't climb. In places if there's 10-15 cm tall obstacle you simply can't lift your leg enough if it is not staircase.Whereas graphics are MOSTLY really good and soundscape is superb (both music and other sounds) some of the graphics are very poorly done - as if they were halfdone. It's like meeting a 2D Donald Duck in the middle of 3D slaughterhouse. Same goes with level design.Overall it feels more like a demo. Like devs had vision but lacked resources and skills to actually do it. So they ended up building rooms and experimenting with stuff - and finally lost their interest to build a playable game in somewhere between. What a pity."

Having said that, this game is the epitomy of the ""short but sweet"" saying. Yes, it is very short, I beat it in less than an hour, but, that's also this game's strong point, since the story is quite simple, and so is the gameplay and it's broody and heavy atmosfere do weigh on you, or at least it did on me, so having it go on for five or more hours might have broken the game rather than improved it. Although, since this world they created is so interesting and rich with detail and backstory, mostly spewed by the main character as he wanders the depths of the mortuary(world of the dead), it did feel a bit TOO short, having it last twice the amount of time, with more story, of course, would been better though.Still, with a price drop I can't recommend this more. Great atmosphere, solid art and design, interesting levels and a rather deep world setting."

It's mainly a scenery tourist game with some minor gameplay sprinkled in. Apparently the protagonist of the game is guilty for having caused the death of a friend and won't stop yakking about it. It seems like the developers started off making a generic horror game, ran out of money and just slapped together what they had and called it a game. The worst part of this game is that the character moves soooooooooooo sloooooooow. The game is thankfully only an hour long, but could've been completed in a quarter of that time of the charcter could move at a decent pace. Please don't buy this game. It will only encourage them. If you're really curious just watch a youtube video of it. At least then you don't have to keep holding the forward button down to get through the levels."

Me slowly walking around with nothing really of substance happening while i look at some interesting visuals, and yes, your character truly does walk at a snails pace, even when running from danger. It did well for what it sold itself on though. The visuals are interesting and quite enjoyable to look at. Sadly, 50-60% of the game takes place in the same stone corridors while you walk around flipping switches.The voice over is well done and well written, and tells a quite interesting take on the afterlife and how it works. The cinematics are relatively well done and look quite nice, but the terrible terribly boring gameplay of 'walking around in the dark flipping switches' is butt♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and ruined the game for me.Overall you've got some fairly interesting visuals, but not enough of them to purchase the game. I give it a 5/10, and I would give it far far lower if it wasn't short. To get visuals across, it's just the right amount of time. Just watch a walkthrough on youtube, will probably be more enjoyable."

Honestly wish I never bought it, it didn't scare me nearly as much as i thought, it was short, repetetive and the narrating was also a joke. The thing that I most enjoyed in this game was when the heavy metal music kicked in at one point. I highly recommend that people save their money and do not buy this game, as for the creator please get an imagination & try again, maybe a longer game like this even would have sufficed but it was too short and as the character barely got to do anything."

The character's speed is so slow, it makes me want to smash my keyboard. It's like developers were trying to say - 'Slow down pal, look what our graphic designers did'. Yes, I enjoyed the atmosphere, it fits the story, however, the ambient background music was not continuous, it was kinda torned, because the track was repeating all the time. Some music was unnecessary, for example the chasing part, it kills the mood. Probably the most disappointment was how short this game was, you can't even get all your card drops. If you want all card drops, you have to leave this game in the background, which is ridiculous.So don't buy this game for full price under any circumstances, save your money, go buy an icecream.P.S.
