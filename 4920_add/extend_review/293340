,Not Recommended,293340,13145776,"Posted: 29 November, 2014",all,Kryyss,"The Good Life description says that this is a game about building a ""commercial empire"" while becoming ""rich and famous"". However in reality, the game is so shallow that these descriptions are bordering on false advertising and misrepresentation. I'll briefly explain how the description provided is just barely met by the reality of what the game actually gives you.Do you build a commercial empire? Well, you do have a box that pops up occasionally to allow you to buy property. But that is the end of it, no further interaction from the player. I wouldn't call it management at all since you cannot even set a charge for renting these properties or influence them at all. What these do is function as bonus cash after you taxi clients from port to port. This brings me nicely onto the boating business aspect.When someone says the game is about running a business, there are some key elements required for that to really apply. Budgets, marketing, customer relations and employee relations are the core things which come to mind.  Well, The Good Life does require you work to a budget but everything else is absent. You apparently have employees because boats you own, but don't personally use, generate income like your other investments. But again, you don't actually influence any of that. Essentially your 'empire' consists of you personally picking up customers and taking them from A to B. Now this wouldn't really be too bad since games like Crazy Taxi actually made this kind of thing enjoyable but sailing empty waters in largely straight lines gets dull very fast and the highlight of the journey is the challenge of docking the boat without damaging it. One of the biggest mistakes the developers made is to give you the slowest boat in the game at the start and not explain that they can instantly buy a speed-boat instead. The developers should have simply provided the speed boat right away to avoid frustrating players.The description also says that this has exploration, treasure hunting and other activities. Well, since you cannot ever leave your boat the exploration is limited to looking at islands from the coast and while the diving sections do allow you to very slowly move around freely, there is only 1 small map which is used for every diving mini-game. There is fishing, but it is a mini-game that just generates some more cash and isn't profitable or serve any purpose in the larger scope of the game. There isn't any complexity to fishing other than pushing the up and down arrows keys to reel the line in or loosen it to stop the line from breaking. There are other trivial events which happen at random as well. Such as tossing life-preservers to rescue people in the water, the occasional pirate speed-boat for you to avoid and the laughable 'tornadoes' which appear from time to time. But none of these are very interesting.I can honestly say that while The Good Life sounds good on paper; what it gives you is a shadow of what it promises. Paying money for this game would be a big mistake even if it was on sale due to the limited entertainment value and what basically boils down to as leveling system where you invest time and energy to just see your bank balance grow. It lacks personality, a sense of progression or achievement and it just barely manages to even qualify as a game at all, due to how shallow the content is."

The idea of the game seems very cool.Pros:- The water is just beautiful!Cons:- Game controls are very weird and hard to get used to.- The boats are SLOOOOOW! even a speed boat is'nt much faster than the rickity boat you get in the beginning.- I was thinking there would be so much more to this game but your really just a water taxi for tourists, about 90 percent of the game is transporting people. Sure there are little side distractions, but they are just that, distractions.- When diving the controls are so bad its almost impossible to do anything underwater.- The clouds look like packs of UFOS- The dolfins sound like a bird of prey rather than a sea creature- The pirates are just weird.  It looks like they are shooting yellow nerf balls at you.  They are terrible shots and it dosen't even affect the strategy of the game much.  Just a weird distraction.Having said all of that, I hope the designers keep improving this game, because I think it could be turned into something great.  It seems like it just needs a bit more tweaking."

Appears to be a lot to do in order to reach the end.Controls are fine once your used to them and basics are explained well in the tutorial.Visuals are nothing spectacular but are plesant to look at and have found no ingame bugs in my 2hrs of play.Only bug so far is unlocking achievements before you do them.The tycoon part of the game is a very simplified property buying process that only involves money managementas to whens the best time to buy. The end game does involve owning all property though so is a nice incentive to pay attention. The reputation part is an important aspect because when you bid on jobs and property you need to pay attention to who else is bidding cause someone with a much higher rep than yours will drive the price up making it tougher to be profitable. Like that part.So if your looking for a casual way to spend your time yet stay engaged this game is a good buy for the price."

I really like this game a lot!Basically, this is a game about moving to the tropics and taking over a small boat transportation enterprise. You spend most your time transporting people from island to island (for a fee), while acquiring the money to help build your tourist industry empire (via bidding on properties that pay rent). There are also missions that have you skin diving to collect treasure and find downed vintage helicopters, etc... You also have the opportunity to fish (which I have yet to get the full hang of). As you gain money and property, you also gain reputation. And yes, you can buy different boats and so on as you increase your funds (and it is all fairly open ended). The game apparently ends when (you go broke or) you drive all of your competitors out of business. Haven't got to that point yet...  :)The game takes a little getting used to as far as the controls, but its smooth sailing (sorry) once you do. There are some minor issues that the developer is on top of and he has already released a patch addressing some of them and adding improvements (literally acknowledging the individual players who suggested them). He is very engaged on the ""discussions"" board and obviously, is very open to those of us who have made suggestions. THIS is the kind of communication that you hope for from a developer!I'm really excited about the possibilities that might be included and the tweaks that will be made. Because this game is really fun to me .... And I believe it can be even more fun as its further refined."

I thought that it felt a little shallow.  Understand that the main point of this game is to gain REP to increase your income through bids, and ultimately purchase all of the real estate to run the AI out of business due to bankruptcy.  After a couple of hours of getting the hang of it, this has become a suprisingly good game.Synopsis:  The cons aren't enough to take away from the strong features of the game.  If you're a fan of simulation/management games, then you must pick this up!  The price is well worth it, even at full $10USD retail.  Also, the DEV is awesome.  He really listened to the community through forums and quickly fixed a lot of the main issues quickly.  I don't think other DEVs put this kind of work in on a Sunday to please the gamers.  Cheers!BUY IT!"
,Recommended,293340,13046477,"Posted: 22 November, 2014",all,Desperado,"“The Good Life” immediately caught my attention since I like management games. It gives me a sense of satisfaction since I’m no business man. This is a close as I’ll get. To start off the graphics looks terrible when you’re still in the city. That’s acceptable though since the game will not be played in the city. Arriving on the island the graphics immediately got better. There is room for improvement though, e.g. if you look at the edges of the water and the beach – it just doesn’t look “real”.What I like is the idea of purchasing real estate apart from running a boat company (really is that what its called? Nice uncle :( ). Although I’ve not had time to really play this game very long the first thing that really annoyed me, was trying to dock the boat. Sure I understand that realism is important but damn, I’m where I’m supposed to be but just can not dock it. The water keeps moving the boat around. So maybe the controls needs some tweaking … or maybe practise makes perfect.But in general I think this game is worth the sale price and even the full price. I mean really, I’ve bought rubbish for between $14.99 - $19.99, that looked intriguing at first but turned out to be the biggest disappointment. So for $9.99, or for the current sale price, I will recommend it. I’m sure the bugs will be sorted out."

I canvased the forum, read reviews and watched a few videos before I bought it on sale at 2.49. The controls take some getting used to and the boats are tad to floppy sometimes but after playing it for awhile I figured out how to catch fish, collect rent, find treasure before using up all the air and in the end I won, literally the game told me that :)I thought this game was made by the company that did Aquadelic GT because the boats and water are very similair but its just a resemblance, Aquadelic GT had more boat sounds like water smacking the hull. At first I was not sure which property to buy and what to focus on but after playing and reading the screens that come up I started buying everything I could afford and completing all the tasks on the trips. I sold off my starter boat thinking I could buy it back or didn't need it but if you want the achievement for owning all boats keep it. I had to start over after like 12 hours because I sold all my old boats to buy property, do not do this as the boats you are not in generate income. I only had a few bugs, the first was the big sport fisherman (purple) has the steering wheel floating over the drivers head, its visible in the picture before buying it and second was the occasional treasure spot on dry land or a photograph target under a building. Otherswise the game was rock solid and I ended up somewhere around 41 on the Hall of Fame.For 2.49 or even 9.99 you would be hard pressed to find anything this entertaining."

When u dock u can't just drive in there, u have to be careful w/ the controls so u don't beat ur boat all up.  It's cool.-Fishing is ok, I only did a couple fishing b/c fish aren't valuable enough to be worth it.  Maybe if I casted closer to the middle there's fish worth catching?  I dunno.-I only did one diving quest for about 5 mins before throwing my hands up in complete disgust and giving up.  I play a game to have a good time, not to get frustrated.

Not as indepth as Ship Sim (if that could be classed as indepth).Not sure what the diving is all about nor the fishing.  But it is a slow cruise taxi service.  The Tycoon bit, as some one said, is basically buy cheap, sell at a profit.  The properties do generate income, so weigh that too.All in all, I'll get something out of it - but that's just me."

However, for those of us with that interest, this game is a gem. The Good Life has its ups and downs, but for the most part it is a very enjoyable game, if it's what you're looking for.Pros :-Huge world to explore, plenty to see and discover-Plenty of missions-Pretty environments-(sometimes) fun minigames-Awesome soundtrack-Good Price-New, rare genre-Online highscore ranking-Great to relax withCons:-The diving is fun, but the camera/player is insanly hard to control-Cheesy intro-Random forced missions while transporting people (rescuing people, taking pictures, running from pirates)-Sometimes you can't save, forcing to lose data or play until the option re-appears.-Long over-complicated 'controls' help on Main Menu-Little interaction with anyone, it gets lonely in such a huge worldOverall, I love this game. If you can look past the downsides it's great. The game is much less 'relax vacation simulator' as I assumed, and more of a 'relaxed small business game, in a vacation area', as you rarely leave your boat/work. However, I think this game is 100% worth the effort. When it goes on sale, the price is perfect (5$). If the devs continue to support this game by fixing bugs and adding new content, this game could be nearly perfect too. Overall, 7/10."

Well, here it is. You are completely in charge, to the point where if you want to abandon ship halfway through transporting them to go diving for treasure, you can. You probably shouldn't, but you can.It's the sort of nonsense I love. And it is, nonsense. If you are looking for an in-depth business or management sim, this is not it.

Some people have complained about the boat controls and how hard ""parking"" them is. I have been around boats most of my life. They DO NOT handle like cars. You need to think ahead and this is how they are modeled in the game. Think ahead, realise you do not stop by just throttling back, and you will be berthing your boat neatly before you know it.There have been complaints that the game sells itself as a ""tycoon"" type game. These may be issues that were in the older versions; I don't know about that as I have only just got the game. All I can say is that you have to make sure you have enough cash to keep your business ""afloat"" at all times. I learned that there is no overdraft facility by paying for my repairs, leaving me cashless. Keep a check on your bank balance!So, do I enjoy the game? Yes. The music in the diving area is calming... For a while then I got annoyed with it, sorry bout that. :( I found that the controls for diving are harder to get a hang of than the boats. But then I have never been diving, perhaps they are fine if you have dived, bit like the boat controls maybe? :)The pirates are a bit odd; another review says they are firing nerf darts at you. Couldn't have put it better myself. So far, even my rickity old startup taxi could avoid them so not sure, at this point, what they are there for. I may regret saying that and maybe there will be a dozen waiting for me when I play next time. I do have a very nice boat now, wouldn't want to lose it or get the green paint scratched.It is in the sale, (should that be sail ;-) ) at the moment; buy it now!"
,Recommended,293340,13073770,"Posted: 24 November, 2014",all,Dr. Arbitrary,"I really wanted to like this game. It's a budget title so I went in with what I think are fair expectations. The problems are fixable so I'll start with the good, end with the bad. Maybe they'll get fixed! Edit: The developers have noted that they're working on some of the negatives in my reveiw. This game is NOT shovelware, it's just rough. It's November now, if you're reading this review a few months from now, check the forums to see if my concerns have been fixed. Edit2: Pirate issues have been addressed. I can safely give this game a thumbs up. It's ROUGH, but still good if you like this kind of game.The graphics are a mixed bag, the models for people are so bad, but it's not really a big deal because the game is about boats, water and scenery. I think they did a pretty good job on that although there is definitely some improvement with weather effects.I really liked the physics for waves. You can't just point your boat in a direction and go, you've got to be active on the helm like in a real boat.The controls for everything except steering your boat are awful. Trying to aim when throwing life rings is nauseating. Trying to use the diving controls is a nightmare, fishing is confusing and unfun even once you know what you're supposed to do.The random event generator is unbalanced, a random Hurricane is awesome. Two in a row is dumb.Pirates, at least early in the game are a death sentence. I got two pirate events in a row before giving up on this game.Edit!!: Boat Damage has been addressed and fixed---Boat damage is economically crippling. A trip taking about 10 minutes might pay for 10% of your ship's damage. A single crash can cause that much, pirates might cause 50% damage. Damage also slows you down so good luck earning your way back to 100% health after a pirate hits you.Edited on 25 Nov 2014: Made a note that the developer has acknowledged some of these problems.Edit: 26 Nov 2014: Repair damage has been rebalanced and pirate areas are now marked.

You are a water taxi transporting wealthy folk between a archipelago of islands. With money earned you can buy more boats and various property oppotunities that go up for sale during taxi missions. There is always things going on and happening during taxi missions which stops the game from getting boring and keeps it interesting, from pirates (which are right nasty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s) to throwing life rings to drowning souls. The game can also be enhanced by playing the game with an erection. Its not perfect though, but has a nice balance. I like how the big boats which earn more are more difficult mooring than the small ones. All boats are available to buy at the start of the game, instead of incermentally so you can buy the best boats early on in the game whereas I would have liked to have worked on increasing my rank to get better boats. The AI players also start with a large amount of property and it will take some time on increaing your own portfolio before you are able to buy large amounts of property meaning the AI players will purchase it. The pre-set camera angles can also be awkward, but using my third hand I played this with an Xbox 360 Controller, mouse and keyboard at the same time.

Almost everything in the game from controlling the boat, to parking the boat, to the minigames is clunky as hell and borders on unplayable. Even if you tolerate that the game is a simple spreadsheet management game about grinding coin to buy pre-made stuff on islands, so it generates coin, so you can pay taxes, and grind more coin to buy more of the premade stuff.

At first you earn money from ""taxi boating"" and minigames like fishing, rescuing people or diving.  Eventually the money from renting pours in and you win.A little repetitive and boring.

Property can only be purchased at random and you can only buy one boat at a time. There's little to do in this game but ferry people around from one point to another. Sure, there's diving and fishing, but they're rarely worth the effort. Once I realized that the game was far more shallow than it let on, it was hard to play it to the end. There's supposed to be an end state, but after almost thirty hours, I haven't seen it yet.Look, I paid a dollar for it, but I'll be honest, it ain't that good. Your time is worth more than this."

Scenery is nice, the atmosphere is there but other things can be a bit annoying. In a way, well it is difficlut to say what kind of game this is. It is party a simple boat simulator, and very small partly management. A few things could easily be done better like those dumb pirates, repetative actions (transporting people), sialing boat bugs etc.Anyway, if even a new version could come out id definitivly buy it but the quite a bit more should be done to improve the game. I am thinking of more types of boats, customizable boats, faster boats (powerboats should sail faster than a sailing boat), managing and controllling your properties (rents), and please ... if bugs are found fix them. It came out did very few updates and that was it...For me i give it a 5.5/10, and I really like it. Makes you dream away.And I appreciate people's review + or - whenever they have played it a decent amount of time."
76561198116953146,Recommended,293340,17125304,"Posted: 19 July, 2015",all,Turtleswatter,"Firstly, this is an unusual game and, looking at the forums the developers are very happy to tweak and improve.  Their obvious intent is to make it as good as it can be.  For this reason I’m recommending it.  There isn’t a lot of experimentation with genre these days and they deserve the credit for having a go and persevering.  I hope that one day my game will be better as they patch it.  And the overall feel is such that even though the gameplay is driving me to distraction I’m still trying!However, there are some cons that are close to game breakers for me.  It feels as if it should be a happy, casual game with a few teeth to make it a bit more exciting – storms, pirates etc.  It also feels as if the random tasks you have to do while trying to get your passengers from A to B within a time frame should be fun and lift the pace a bit.Unfortunately, as it stands at the moment playing this game is a chore purely because, despite experimenting with lots of different combinations of settings, the controls are, quite frankly, awful.With my basic gaming computer set up, the boat controls are fine and as they should be, as long as you realise that these are boats and not racing cars.  However the big problem is the camera and mouse controls which are fantastically erratic.The mouse control is laggy, which means that you have to spend way too much time trying to hit a button resulting in loss of control of your boat. I have since found that if you go into your computer control panel and turn the mouse sensitivity down to the slowest you can, the situation - although not perfect - improves dramatically. The camera angles are poor.  On the face of it, as you are given 4 different camera positions, you should be able to easily see whatever you need to.  Unfortunately 2 of them have very limited use – why would I want to see inside the boat unless I’m happy to crash?  The third, I haven’t been able to find a use for and the default one, the one that you are almost constantly using, is a nightmare.In order to look around, you have to hold the left mouse button down and move the mouse in the direction you want to see (up, down and around).  This control varies wildly from fair, where you can see everything with very little effort; to ultra sensitive where the slightest touch leaves you looking at a scene and you have no idea where you are (please remember the boat is still moving at this point - well until the harbour wall stops it).  Alternatively you can end up looking at the bottom of the sea.  The problem here is that it seems to become ultra sensitive when you need it to behave most – such as when you’re trying to dock. Compare this with the lagginess of the mouse when you need to use it to click on things and the whole thing just doesn’t make sense.The sensitivity is an issue when you are trying to take photographs. You find your bird.  You point your boat in the right direction and hold the right hand mouse button down.  Sadly you see a piece of blue sky with absolutely no idea where in the sky you are.  You wave your mouse about in the hope you might catch the bird.  No luck.  You go into the normal view and find the bird again – to be fair not very far from where it was initially.  Try again.  No luck.  Eventually you glimpse the tip of the wing and you realise how fast your mouse is scanning the sky – you’re hardly touching it but it’s going so fast that by the time you realise you’ve seen the tip of the wing, you’ve got no chance of backtracking and finding it again. Rinse and repeat until you luck out.  Absolutely no way can you do this when you’ve got a passenger on board.Having said all this everything else is lovely – which is why, along with the developers, I’m persevering with it.  It’s just that this could easily become my favourite casual game and it’s frustrating to have it spoilt by the controls."

Every 2 to 4 trips pirats are coming into your line trying to damage your boat, every 2 to 4 trips tornados are coming into your line. For a simulation game a bit to unrealististic and very nervy. Very nervy are the camera controls, both with mouse and gamepad. The bigger your ship, more problems with controlling in side missions. I am not so happy with it.There could be more informations about docking stations to the map before you agree into a customer's contract. F.e. distance from current location and a list of it. An option is missing to get more passengers in one journey.If you run into a sandbar, don't think about to call for help. There is no option given in this game. You can load your game save by hoping that the sandbar will release you, but it depends on how deep you ran into it.You can change your bought boats at each docking station if you like.But I can give this one my recommendation because of the atmosphere of this game and all the skills you have to use making this one very special. All in all a nice game with interesting challenges. :)"

The graphics are not terrible but they can be a little more sureal. The pysics just don't seem right and it throws off the feel for the game. The concept is golden but the gameplay is not what it was all to be suspected. It gets very reptitve very fast in less than thirty minutes. Has potential but for now I give it a solid 5/10 for now.

The controls are fine - diving is tricky at first but ok when you get the hang of it and, apart from that, the boats handle like boats. Things really pick up once you've got a sailboat. Trying to outrun pirates or a twister when you're short of time and your destination means your'e sailing into the wind? Yeah that works.All in all, The Good Life will easily provide enough hours of entertainment to justify the purchase. Go ahead."
