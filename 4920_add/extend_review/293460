Imagine something like Zombie Shooter mixed with Project Zomboid in a way. You move around a city, collecting quests and loot and you're surviving against the undead. I've come across 8 different types as well as bosses [which actually feel like bosses].  The loot system is great [imagine Diablo with more of a weapon variety including  Handguns and Shotguns] and I'm liking the chracter progression [level up and you choose the equivalent of perks to add to your skill-set]. There's also a noise system in the sense that if you fire a gun, they all know where to come to munch on you. You can stealth around them but the loss of XP is just too much for me to do that.There's things I'd like to see though. Possibly some character creation or at least some customization with different armour/gear sets.I also think this would be insanely good as a co-op/Multi-player game.There's no many bugs as of yet. I've seen enemies clip through terrain and even get stuck within walls but nothing game-breaking as of yet. Also some of the animations are really clunky [especially the attack animations] and I've also found that when I go onto the screen to create a profile and then back out, the interface crashes and I have to restart.All in all, I think this is a pretty solid alpha and I can see this being quite good with some work. I'm looking forward to the updates ^_^"

HOWEVER, this game here, I Shall Remain is an exception to my library. I really love this game due to several reasons:- constant updates/bug fixes (Awesome!)- very atmospheric soundtrack- gameplay is easy to understand- run properly on low-end laptop(s)** note: you have to tone down a lot the graphic settings if you are running on low-end machine, buthey, it runs!- quite cheap (RM31 is a bargain for me!)- can be very tough if you just charge in without paying attention to recommended character's levelbefore entering a new area (great challenge)- 3 modes (Prologue, Survival and Story)- High replaybility value.- Post WW2 Zombie Apocalypse (Most Zombie Shooter apply present-day settings, so this is a freshidea to me)So basically, I strongly recommend this game. Oh, and aif you buy this game, try to play the Prologue first before jumping into the game.11/10 would try killing Hunterlag using a metal pipe again."

I think they are more of a guide so you don't get lost.-The music is freakin great, spot on incredible adding a sense of depressing atmosphere.Great game, would reccomend."

I think more ARPGs should follow this format. Your character progresses by using a weapon. Using a shotgun increases your skill for that, which in turn increases your rifle skill and in turn increases agility.  Once you level up, you gain a ""doctrine,"" which are essentially skill trees which help you customize your character even further, as well as research points for further specialities. You can build your character to be a leader with buffed NPCs, or a solo rifle wielding killing-machine.  The system is fun because it feels natural...why would I ever put my hard-earned points into small arms when you've been killing enemies with your trusty winchester shotgun?* New spin on post-apocalyptic games: When you think ""post apocalyptic,"" you think of Fallout, right? Past a future time with robots and computers? Well, this game takes place in the 1940s, sometime after WW2, and things have gone terribly, terribly wrong. Its a cool and novel way of looking at an old trope.* Serum: You're also infected. Which means you have to kill zombies to gain their zombie blood, from which the serum's derived. BUT the main currency in the game is serum. So there's a tight balance between getting skill points (by selling serum) to keeping some in stock for you to use before you become too infected that you can't fight anymore. It's a tight balance that keeps you on edge.Bottomline: Game is Fun, pay and play as soon as you get the CashMoney for it."

I am very happy that I bought this game.The game is a story-focused ARPG zombie survival game set in 1945. It also has a non-story based survival mode that I have not played yet. The gameplay is somewhat similar to State of Decay, minus vehicles, but actually smoother and more polished in this ""alpha"" state. Also there is an interesting twist in that your protagonist is infected and periodically needs serum to control the disease. The graphics are very nice. The game runs with no glitching or framerate choppiness.I have not played enough to experience every aspect of the game, but so far I give it a 9/10. Now I am going to play it some more."

Don't do what I did on my first playthrough of Episode 1 and use only guns. You waste ammo FAST and cant kill the bosses with close range weapons. I'm waiting for Darkwood which I belive is a similar game.I only have one problem. I think my serum is bugged because it keeps going down even if I dont take it, causing me to become infected with out it. Unless loosing it is part of the game, the devs might want to fix that or explain that."
,Recommended,293460,17838445,"Posted: 1 September, 2015",all,aShotOfDaniels,"Very fun and addictive game for its meager price-tag.Pros:+ Addictive top-down (and usually frantic) combat mechanics.+ Looting system that always has you drooling in excitement when an orange/purple drops.+ Explorative game-play with multiple side-quests/areas to venture, usually resulting in a mini-boss.+ VARIED enemies, and plenty of them. Even the basic walkers have different variations.+ Slightly repetitive but over-all beautiful sound-track that doesn't intrude too much into the game-sounds.+ Relatively stable game; I've only had one crash so far and that was spamming the flame-thrower in a sub-way.Cons:- Story started to get a bit lack-luster after a while; the usual 'catch up with the plot that's a couple of days in-front.'- Friendly AI can suck a hard-on sometimes. Mechanics in place to control distance/aggro, but they'll still run off a mile for a single walker, usually ignoring the LMG I gave them to favour a damaged combat knife.- Visual obstruction; actually consider this as game-mechanic. Lighting is poor at night, but you have flares/torch, though they kind'a suck and it's far better to head to a safe-zone and rest till day-light.During a zombie-cluster-bum-fun you'll lose yourself among the walkers and your window-licker companions while corpses turn into offensively large clouds of red mist, being in-doors can make this extremely irritating.Over-all, I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of titles like Diablo and Dungeon Siege (just not DS3...) and if you fancy a try at the respective game-play but with GUNS... And more importantly, a FLAME-THROWER. Dine away."

It gives you a relatively easy (If you want it to be, this game can be very hard) environment to explore, loot, and kill/be killed in. Ammo and health aren't terribly scarce but you will need every last pickup to get out on top. The game gives you companions, weapon variety, intuitive contols and smooth gameplay.Highly recommend for anyone who's a fan of games falling in any of the top 5 tags for this title.Some of the animations look silly, the combat can be repetitive, some things just don't make sense, like the UI and controls. But there is a tutorial to help you git gud."
,Not Recommended,293460,17713090,"Posted: 25 August, 2015",all,DS,"I honestly don't know - why this game is rated Very Positive (at the moment of writing my review). I don't know - maybe it would bloom at the late game, but this far game feels highly unfinshed - more like a beta test, where testers have to pay to test the game.The game is not without positive points - but this far - I've found 2 of them:- Advancement system, based on 'you are what you use' and unlocking 'perks' that further shape you into desired hero, which is both nice and annoying (because you can't save some points and invest them into firing rifles, for example, all of a sudden - you need to tediously go from missing every second shot to being able to hit zombie into eye from great distance)- Setting - most of zombie games happen in modern/futuristic settings and there are not many WW2 zombie games.But negative points are plenty:- Graphics - that's my first problem.And it's not a bad quality of models or textures or anything - it's a very wrong composition of them and lighting - during my game play most of time - I've controlled brown/black (no racial offense - I mean color of his clothes) character, who was running across brown/black land killing brown/black zombies.Sometimes I couldn't see my character in that mess. Quite often I couldn't see enemies. And flashlight doesn't help much. And to add to all that - after they are killed common enemies dissipate into red mist which obscures your vision even more.If developers were aiming for 'noir' type of style - adding 'brown' to the pallette was wrong - it makes you feel swimming through some sewage.Update: Thanks to developer's reply - I found out that there is 'aging' affect in options that makes things more brown. So, turning it off helps somewhat and returns colors to the game. Stil - other graphic problems stay - hard to spot enemies, hard to notice character (there are still moments when even without 'aging' character blends with back ground perfectly), blood mist into which dead enemy turn (imagine backing off from a horde of zombies, while shooting at them - and every shot enemy bursts into cloud of mist to cover its buddies). Also, found another problems - when your character gets covered by a wall - you can see his outline through it. But when enemy gets covered by one - there is no outline, even if the enemy is hitting your character.- Sound - or mostly lack of it. There are sounds of gunfire and background music mostly stays very quiet, aside from moments when it plays compositions 'cat jumped onto piano and we've decided to include it into soundtrack'. There is NO in-game voice, which brings you to another problem - sometimes character tell their thoughts/feelings/else, sometimes there is even a narative, but it's all (except some dialogues) made as a string at a bottom of the screen, which is hard to notice (most of the time you'd be focused on shooting things or looking at other parts of screen).- Level design - levels are a mess. In some games - there is a difference between one building and another - but here they are almost same. And maps are a mess as well - sometimes you see a passage on the map only to find out that it's blocked by something. And yes, things that block your passage add insult to the game - game tells you that you are a soldier, so you expect to be trained in things like jumping ot stepping over things... but, no. A couple of tires is an impassable object. Knee-high barier - also.Sumarizing my opinion - the game HAS potential.But in curent state - it's a mess that doesn't feel pleasant to play. If you really want it - try following it and see if it would change.After fidling with graphical setting - game stopped being unpleasant, but it's still clumsy. So, I still won't recommend and name it a risky purchase - but at least now I see why SOME people may like it. I'll try to update this review if there would be any significant changes in game or my opinion."

It's got the good ol' rpg elements (dungeon sieger) in a post-apocalyptic world with zombies. Lots of customization options for your character, stat-wise, lots of abilities and lots of loot. It's nice to fight zombies in the dark xD.It's a bit hard at the beginning but but it gets easier as you progress on, as all rpg's do.Yes, there's some downsides, as with all games, like murky graphics, hard to see at times, too much text (i'm not the reader type) but it's all in a good package.I'd say definitely give it a try if you're into RPG's or zombie survival games, as it's cheap as chips."

The only problems I have come accross is the hand to hand and melee fighting is a little buggy. Could just be my computer, but I don't think it is. With a few small fixes here and there this will be a great game. Definatly worth the price to play the Beta/Alpha test, whatever it is at now. Besides the small fighting issues, I am not sure I could ever collect enough serum to get my ""infection"" down, it is/has been full up and now I need 10 serums just to drop the 20-25% you get for a shot. I fully intend to keep trying and I am enjoying it greatly. Highly recommended to any who like action-rpg type games wether you are into zombies or not, as I am mostly not.Can't wait to see how the finished product rolls though.I want to make sure I add that every issue I have had has been fixed. As well as the infection/serum thing was just because I was early on in the game. When I play now I can easily keep the infection down. Rookie me thinking I would never get enough serum. I choose to leave that on my review to point out that that is how I was as a newbie player. It had nothing to do with the game or its systems.Very fun game and I get addicted when I play and cannot stop. With all of the patches it seems to get better and more fun with most all of them. 5 stars to both the game and the developers."

Set in an alternate history at the end of the Second World War, when Nazis managed to release a deadly virus over US territory, the game tells the story of two brothers and their intricate relation with the apocalyptic world that emerges in the wake of the disastrous Z0M81 pandemic.The first thing that I loved in this game is the graphics. They are sharp, there are a lot of details in the map and it really reminds of an old city like London for example. Another amazing aspect worth mentioning is the day and light cycle and the weather changing system that it also affects the mood of the characters. The soundtrack of the game fits the title perfectly and it creates an atmosphere of mystery.Moreover, the weaponry in this game is really enormous. From melee weapons to grenades and shotguns everything is there and can be found scattered in the game. The total number of weapons is over 30 and each one has 4 different levels. Each weapon can be upgraded and repaired if needed! From time to time also the game offers you the chance to enter vehicles and tanks and defend yourself to larger groups of infected.The game offers a really enjoyable experience andI totally recommend itespecially if you consider how cheap the game is.THE GOOD- Graphics- Day-night cycle and weather- Weaponry- Soundtrack- Price- Leveling up systemTHE BAD- Poor lighting in the dark- Objects can block your visibility- Quests sometimes hard to spot- You can get lost easily- Slow progress sometimes8/10DISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD |GREAT| AMAZING | MASTERPIECE"

,Recommended,293460,10367409,"Posted: 6 June, 2014",all,Xosski,"I bought this game not expecting much since I try almost all zombie games I can find. If you are looking for a diablo esque game with zombies and surival elements this is for you. You get to build a team as you slowly find the people in the city and do missions or save their lifeless body from the hoard to earn their trust. The rpg elements are minimalistic as in the skill progression is linear( not saying its a bad thing.) I'm just saying at this time in alpha skills only have 5 upgrade options for each path, so dont expect to have multiple classes right now since the progression is limited in that aspect and hopefully they will add more skill trees/ make different playable characters with different trees for skills. You will spend a majority of your time exploring the city and farming supplies to make it to the next mission.  The enemies seem pretty easy but in the options you can change the difficulty its easy-normal-hard-impossible in that order and there may be one more its late and my heads a bit fuzzy. For what i paid for the game it is very much worth it and if you are looking for a top down free roam with some rpg elements this game is for you. My only qualm with the game is that the camera seems uber clunky and could use some fine adjustment/tightening but other then that its pretty fun and straight forward. The game mechanics are so easy you can skip the tutorial and figure out what is what in a few minutes tops. Great game it has the potential to be one of the best zombie games available this year on steam."

No, but it is partly open worldDoes this game have online co-op? No, but it is just early access and the devs have said that once they got most of the stuff for the single player out of the way, they may start work on an Online mode.Does this game have♥♥♥♥♥♥♥devs who don't get along with those who buy their game? No they are really nice guys to know and guess what it's only 3 of them who work on ISR!I wouldn't let that fact it is not fully open world stop you from buying it, ISR is a very fun game, and the devs of it are some of the nicest guys ever. I've seen at lest one of them reply in every single discussion todate. Hell I even ended up in a nice little chat with them when I linked them a pic of my first version of the unique gun Unbreakable.And to add even more to how nice they are. Due to how active I am in their discussion and how helpful I've been with suggesting ideas for ISR they added recently have added or will be adding in the next update a unique Iron Pipe called Nightshade which they have said is based off one of my past steam names Nightshade (Don't believe me? Check out the discussion I started in the Suggestions and improvements secton of the ISR discussions) P.S they recently changed it to from a iron pipe to a flamethowerAnother user I know called Steve Blanner also had this happen to him where the devs have added a unique small machine gun (more commenly know to us as SMGS) called Steve Blanner's Repeater. Which I have the link of Steve's gun within the gamehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ht4l208jw717fhh/Zombie01142015_133528849.jpg?dl=0As for the gameplay? Well if you've come looking for bugs, this is not the place for you as I've not had any gamebreaking bugs that stop me from doing parts of the story, only the old one or two bugs that caused me to miss out on a item but nothing that stopped me from doing the story.There is also a large choice of weapons to pick from and doing pretty much anything including walking and running can level you up.As for the weapons don't expect anything like lazer guns or like a small lazer dagger as the game is set in WWII time so all the weapons will be WWII ones till the devs say otherwise (but we do have flamethowers and I think soon a WWII RPG)The controls are easy to use and get used to, that I don't even see why you would want to ask for controller support for ISR as the game is pretty much made for keyboard and mouse.Oh and unlike most devs the guys who work on ISR never just shoot your idea down the second you post it instead they say it may not fit well into the story or time of ISR but they never say they can't do it, hell sometimes they even think about your suggestion for the game and then come up with way they could add it to the game in a way that it would fit well into ISRThat is all I can say about the game (for now) but I will say this, you should really support this game and it's devs as they have my full support for 2 reasons.1: It's only 3 people working on this game which I find very fun to play2: As I've already said those 3 people working on this game are most nicest devs I've ever come acrossSo come on, what you waiting for? Support ISR as I for one want to see this game become a huge hit!And I forgot to add one last thingISR runs so smooth it looks like you're playing a game that isn't even in alpha or beta but as if its a already be released as a full working game already.

The ranged combat in this game is satisfying and the skill progression / development systems has allot of deph.  The downside is that there are some bugs, none I encountered were game breaking.  Thier customer support is awesome and the developers listen to what the players have to say.  The worse aspect of the game is the visuals.  Its really difficult to see what you are doing sometimes.  Trees completely cover up your character and enemies making it impossible to aim.  It is also very difficult to see at night but I think that was intended.  It makes sense that in a post apocalyptic world with not lights; eveything will be pitch black.  But even with a flashlight it is still very difficult to see.  You can use flares, to solve the problem but they are very limited.  Another problem I had is that you cannot buy ammo or explosives. You can only pick them up from scavaging or enemy kills. This makes character specialization in explosives imposssible and specialization in one gun type difficult.  You will need to pick several gun types in order have a steady supply of ammo.  Benifits from the type of guns you use are exclusive. If you use a different type the bonuses you bought with your skill points are deactivated.  The story is acceptable.  I found the music to be very good and fits the mood very well.  The whole game, especially in the beginning gives you a hopeless feeling, which is appropriate for a horror themed game."

Missions can be confusing to follow, the game gets way to dark, and your flashlight dies fairly quick leaving you with a pitch black screen, usually at the worst time possible, with floods of enemies attacking you. With all the bad said, if you stick with this game, and give it a chance, most will enjoy this game. The leveling, and item mechanics in this game, such as repairing, enhancing, and how resources are used. Does add more appeal to this game. Overall its not that bad of a game.

In Story Mode, you must also keep an eye on the bar to the virus does not die, you can also set the difficulty of the game and Hardcore mode on/off."

The biggest issues that have been brought up are already being adressed, THAT is how Early Access should work.All in all, I am very much looking forward to the release and hope that ISR and respectively Scorpius Games get the attention they deserve.My gut tells me they're going to finish this game 100%, no questions - and then probably pack another 15-20% on top of that, just because they're1) awesome2) convinced of their vision3) capable of pulling it offSo, if you came here looking for the game that would've been the outcome of ""Diablo"" and ""Commandos"" making a baby while ""Hellgate London"" was spying creepily through the keyhole, this is as close as you'll ever get to that!"

I am a HUGE fan of top-down style games, after watching the trailers and doing some research I decided to take the risk and buy this EA title. I have had some crappy luck  with Steam's EA program (cough...Starforge).Honestly, it didn't take me long to fall in love with I S. R. and it's unique take on the top-down RPG style of games. Of course still being in Alpha there were some rough edges, but I always found it very playable and had very few crashes, even at such an early stage in development.  During I S.R.'s time in early access I've seen it improve patch after patch and month after month and of course there have always been regular content updates.The devs are such an amazing group of guys/gals and are/should be an example of how to interact with the people who took the chance and supported you so early on.  I'm excited to see the game finally get released, I'm hoping that the game sells well so they can go on to make more games.I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RPG's, open worlds, top-down shooters or supporting a good team of devs who have done a bang-up job with this game."

I've changed settings, the resolution, and whether it's fullscreen or not, but it still does it.Getting around during timed events is too difficult because the map makes no sense and you can only see two feet in front of you.The menus feel really convoluted and the explanations in the beginning don't make them any easier to understand.Plus the constant pressure of things approaching and attacking you makes it difficult to read the dialogue at the bottom of the screen; not sure what I'm supposed to be focusing on.Pretty much the only good thing I was able to experience before I just closed the game in annoyance was that I was able to maintain a decent framerate.

I had more then a few hours of  fun playing this title on an old WIN Vista 32 machine. Otherwise avoid buying this title.Now.....Scorpius@Eugen had this to say about solving problems with why I Shall Survive does not run.Scorpius@Eugen [developer] Dec 20 @ 3:52amPlease make sure you install all libraries from ""Steam\SteamApps\common\IShallRemain\_CommonRedist"" because we've had issues with Steam not prompting to install those on game installation. This will surely not allow the game to start on any system.Another suggestion is to delete the Save directory from ""Steam\SteamApps\common\IShallRemain\Common\Save"" and run the game again. There have been changes on how the game read the save files while updating in Early Access and this might be the issue.If this doesn't fix it could you please run the game from ""Steam\SteamApps\common\IShallRemain\Debug"" and send us the log files after the crash so we can take a look at them?(support@scorpiusstudios.com)Thank you!This gem of a game has clearly become abandonware that is on sale to make a buck.When any DEV points to STEAM as a problem for why their game doesn't run, and will not on any OS because of the above described STEAM issue. It begs the question of why it's even being sold, or made available for sale. And I say.... surely thats to make a buck for bad code.Deleting broken libraries only to have STEAM re-install the SAME broken libraries. Is not a solution. Proper patching is and writing new code for a HOTFIX, one that makes a game viable for play... is.Also pointing a gamer  to send LOG files that aren't clearly indicated by a DEVELOPER (and said logs actual location),  after a crash, is no soution as well. This is not Customer support. Providing a viable solution that directly solves a problem is.So buyer beware. But as I mentioned, this gem of a game was fun....for it's time. But if your currently using an OS beyond WIN Vista or 7, DO NOT BUY.And Defininately DO NOT BUY, as Scorpius@Eugen had admitted that the files do not install properly via the STEAM platform. On any system.Avoid this title. PC Games that don't run aren't worth any price. Developers that still try to sell them in the STEAM marketplace, when they clearly KNOW their games will not run, should not be supported.Any gaming developer that provides inteligent sounding solutions, but does not solve problems is only providing a basis for a cop-out for cash digital enterprise. One on STEAM that allready is far too full of consumer con artists, and their version of customer support as well.Ones that pointedly do not provide digital products that ARE currently playable games."
