76561197993189274,Not Recommended,293740,11743438,"Posted: 16 August, 2014",all,Jack Ketch,"Road Not Takenis described as a Roguelike Puzzle game, in which you throw and move objects around with your magic staff to rescue children trapped in the Forest. Some puzzles are hand-crafted, but the majority are procedurally generated.The Good:The Art and Music are great! Wonderful Art Style and the music is a nice addition to the levels.The Bad:Procedural generation is a double-edged sword. Yes, you're going to get rooms in which things are laid out in an easily-solvable manner, but you're also going to get rooms that are basically broken (or quickly made so by a bad move). For example, Bear Statues ""stick"" to nearby objects, so if you get an object in a corner behind a Bear Statue, you are pretty much out of luck. Good luck corraling six Deer or other animals (which move around on their own) to unlock a door. A single novice move can render entire areas of the map inaccessible.The Ugly:The difficulty curve is brutal, and saps fun out of the game. Year 4 (of 15) seemed to be my Year of Death for a while, but with practice I've made it all the way to Year 8. Of course, Roguelikes have death, but after you die you should have some incentive to want to play again. In RNT, Death only occurs after several frustrating rounds of losing life/energy, and then when you are at your weakest, the Doom Spirits hunt you down and kill you. Where is the fun in that!?The Save/Checkpoint system actively discourages you from using it - what is up with that?I know people will argue that the game is about hard choices and you aren't intended to save every single child in each individual year - but that makes me wonder about the narcissistic sociopaths who lack empathy for children freezing to death in the Forest.In summary,my chief complaint is that the game is more frustrating than fun. There’s potential here, but in Road Not Taken’s current state, I cannot recommend it."

The story is emergent and available in small pieces, the gameplay is simple in theory but gets more complex as you put all the parts together (similar to how one piece movement in chess is easy but putting them all together gets complex). The goal of the game is to brave the wilds and find lost children, and playing the game gives me a very happy feeling which means a lot since I have issues with depression. I would recommend this game to everyone, it is well worth the price."
,Recommended,293740,11568002,"Posted: 5 August, 2014",all,GustoGaiden,"Road Not Taken is great. It is a really well done puzzle-roguelike with a FANTASTIC core mechanic. It is one of those games that absolutely nails the concept of easy to learn, difficult to master. It also has a bleak yet hopeful atmosphere coursing through the entire thing, which I found very charming.Winter is slowly overtaking a small village. You play as a forest ranger tasked with recovering children lost in the woods. The core mechanic involves combining objects in the forest together to make new ones by picking them up and throwing them. You can also cary objects, but doing so depletes your ever dwindling energy reserves.There is a staggering number of items and combinations, and it's a LOT of fun to expirament with all the different objects. Some combinations are beneficial, replentishing your energy, allowing you to manipulate the forest easier, and save the kids easier, but others are dangerous, and you should take care not to clumsly throw things around, creating hazardous items accidentally. However, many of the dangerous items can also be turned into bigger benefits if combined correctly. It strikes a  really great ballance between risk and reward.Being a roguelike, it has a LOT of replay value, especially since you can forge relationships with a few of the towns folk. If they like you, they will tell you tips, secrets, and even give you items and accessories to make your job easier, or harder if that's what you're in to! You have the ability to replay the previous year if you really screw things up, but I have also tried starting over from year 1 to leverage all the new combinations I have learned."

I love the soundtrack, and the story makes me want to know more.The game is a rogue-like puzzle-game. You are a ranger who's job is to save the kids who are lost in the woods. While not in a level you can socialize with the npcs in the town by giving them gift. You will get items and secrets this way. You can also have a wife/husband. Personally i got attached to one of the npcs quite fast.If you love puzzlegames that can be played through multiple times (random level generation) you got to play this game.

It's earned its puzzle tag here on the steam store and definitely favors deliberation. The need for strategy isn't unlike the roguelike genre, for sure, but rather than having to worry about enemies coming to kill you if you make a wrong move, you have to strike a balance between meeting objectives and the energy it will cost you to do so.There are multiple ways to go about finishing every dungeon, and you don't actually have to complete the dungeon to leave it; find half the children and see them safely home, if that's all you feel you can do. There are different leaderboards, reflecting different things to strive for.And the game is pleasing to eye and ear."

Look no further.Road Not Takenis a hard-as-nails, puzzle based, story-rich, atmospheric roguelike that breaks boundaries.This title was expertly crafted. Lots of attention to detail, and my-oh-my is there depth. It is quite a dark game, as well.Pros:+Like any roguelike worth its salt,Road Not Takenhas a lot of content and mystery to unravel and master. Tons of gameplay here. I haven't even scratched the surface at 5 hours.+Puzzles are super challenging, in a good way.+Atmosphere and artwork are absolutely stunning. Really well done here. Lots of attention to detail.+The story is rich and is a welcome addition to modern roguelike/lites.Cons:-Yeah, its difficult, but do-able. I mention this because it looks like a fairly cute puzzle game, but it can be overwhelming at times (especially if you want to avoid spoilers), IMO. Even in 5 hours, I haven't gotten very far.-Addiction factor isn't the highest, but I can generally look past this, since its got tons of depth. Hard to explain.

Imagine a mix between Spelunky or The Binding of Isaac, a new take on chess and Braid. Hard to imagine I guess, so try it for yourself. It will blow your mind. I would say this is THE best puzzle game I've played this year, it might even be one of the best games released this year, all-categories. A strong recommendation.

76561198107118085,Recommended,293740,20015270,"Posted: 27 December, 2015",all,【＝◈︿◈＝】 Dani-Claw,"This game...wow. So much can be said about this game. I can't get enough of it! Here are a few main categories to sum up just some of the many amazing things about this spectacular game:The Gameplay:  The dungeon randomization makes every year and every life unique, and it is up to your wit and problem solving to decide how to best craft and cluster the right items in order to get to the children. Sometimes the game can be UNBEARABLY HARD, but you still push on 'til you die or have to return to town without having saved all the children. Many of the negative reviews I see have to do with the difficulty of some of the dungeon generations, and yes, it CAN get infuriating! But there's nothing wrong with just starting a new life -I did it several times and got amazing careers afterward.Energy preservation is key -a simple step in the wrong direction can take your life, or make your journey incredibly more difficult, so it is best to evaluate every room before taking action. You also do countless backtracking trips as you need to craft and arrange items with just the right amount of items, so your adjacent rooms are your friends. Low on health? Have an axe in one room and a ninja bear in the other one? Just throw it over and kill the bear for your apple. Need to get rid of a dark spirit AND acquire health? Take the blue fire from one room and throw it at the spirit in the other room to get a very helpful stew.I LOVE how creativity is emphasized -there are numerous ways to create the same item, and this mechanic can be both beneficial (multiple ways to make food) or detrimental (multiple ways to create daemon bunnies or dark spirits). The ""teleport to mayor"" mechanic can save your life in very many instances, or help you get to a room from one entrance if the other entrance is blocked or dangerous.Because this game uses permadeath, you should always find ways to acquire money, rice, or berries, because the game is graceful in providing you a shrine to offer to and ensure that you will respawn. However, you lose very important charms upon death, so sometimes leaving some children behind when in a rut is a better choice than dying and letting your character respawn with next to nothing.The Art:  The art is beautiful, charming, and deceptive- very gruesome and dark themes can be overlooked because of how cutesy the art style is. The atmosphere is remarkable -the sounds, surroundings, and music totally and completely immerse you, making you easily waste hours upon hours on this game.The Characters: The customization in how you build your relationships -friendships and romantic- with differently generated characters every life gives you the desire to do better in the dungeons, and thus, receive more rewards to use as gifts to give to villagers. The dialogue is hilarious, sad, moving, touching, and sweet -the writers of this game put great thought and work into the dialogue. It makes the game that much more alive and real to you, and in combination with how you've built your relationships with the other characters, it can get you emotionally invested. I felt happy when a character would do kind gestures, return romantic feelings, and became unreasonably upset and sad when they would cheat on me (in romantic relationships) or simply decide they didn't like me anymore. I had to take a step back once in a while to remind myself that THIS IS A GAME! XDThis game holds a dear place in my heart, because you can see all the heart and soul the development team poured into it, and it offers infinite playtime that can always feel fresh and enjoyable. Because of this game, I have become a loyal follower of the small game developer team -SpryFox. There is something incredible about a small indie game developer doing so well with their games and it's encouraging for all other small groups of developers and artists that want to make their dream games become reality."

Despite the emphasis on 'choices', there is very little you can do to ensure you'll do better in your next year, or as the next poor fool in a 15-year quest to save the children of the town. You can ban a couple of items, choose from mostly identical equipment, and pick between easy or hard missions.The easy missions tend to be randomly too easy: the hard missions tend to randomly be piles of objects you have to muddle through. The ""recipes"" you learn as you go are by and large useless, except for the two or three you'll keep to heart and use every time.It's still a pretty good puzzle game when it works, though. The framing story is also quite unique: it's delivered in the smallest pieces that need to be recalled and put together, and every nitpick you might have about the plot is eventually answered.The framing 'town' parts are purposefully random. Spend your resources wooing a townie, level them all the way up to True Love Forever, and they might still decide to ditch you for someone else at Year 15. Unlike the carefully exacting main game, the town section is one gamble on the future after the other and proud of it.""There are no stories here, just circumstances"", one of the townies says. Yep. No comforting answers to hard questions like ""am i doing the right thing"", here. After some time you might wonder whether you should not only stop rescuing the children but actually set the entire town on fire; yet there are only so many options to you. Marry or stay single. Have children or not. Easy Mode or Hard Mode. Die in a struggle to get the last child out of the storm, or carefully pace yourself to your retirement.In short, it's a game about choices more than it is about the consequences of those choices. Take it, or leave it."

However, nothing could prepare me for the degree of unilateral cruelty of the random level generator, nor how immediately repetative the game becomes.It initially reminded me of long lost point and click adventure games when I first viewed the trailer videos. However, it quickly becomes apparent that with no clear direction or reliable strategy involved, it simply becomes a matter of randomly flinging groups of items together until you get a favorable reaction. These are then noted in an in-game journal, and you spend the rest of the game desperately flipping through its pages looking for some sort of advantage to be culled from the horrific assortment of hazzards and obstacles that work to make your gaming experience both futile and frustrating.NOT ONLY are some levels seemingly impossible to pass, but ""saving your progress at shrines"" only means you respawn at the beginning of the current level... with NONE of your items or relationships SAVED!! Rogue-like indeed!The designers do win points for a creative new type of game, great art, music and cut scenes."

I got it on sale last year but didn't play it until now, and while it is a beautiful game with a unique style and taking on some pretty heavy themes and ideas for an indie game, the gameplay is frustrating. It's not truly a puzzle game because there are many solutions for the roguelike challenges, and it is so infuriantingly easy to softlock and be forced to start the puzzles over, without really learning anything in the process. There are some UI issues too, with text boxes popping up when and where you don't want them.

76561197983672075,Recommended,293740,18389282,"Posted: 8 October, 2015",all,DaetherX,"A cute puzzle game. It's hard to describe.Your goal: To save all the lost children in the woods and reunite them with their parents.Your energy free controls are to move up/downleft/right, to pick up everything around you in the four directions, and to throw them all at once. If you move while holding something it will take precious energy. You can match several of similar items, or different items, depending on ""secrets"" (crafting recipe?) that you learn through play or from villagers. Like throwing the axe at a tree makes a log, and throwing two logs next to each-other makes a campfire which reduces the cost of carrying things on that screen, or putting three beehives together makes a jar of honey which gives you a little bit of energy.Sounds simple, but while the controls are simple, the puzzle nature of trying to get to the kids, get them to their parents (or vice versa), get the kids to the starting area, or open pathways to another part of the forest can be complex. Sometimes it's downright frustrating but not in a bad game design way, just a yell obsceneties at the angry racoons who claw you if get next to them, or ninja bears who might block your path randomly way.Don't let the art style fool you, this game starts off fairly easy, but difficulty can spike. You won't always save all the kids, but that's okay. You can quit trying to help them at any time, but saving half or more of the kids is the minimum to make the mayor okay with your work. (Edit: Apparently failing to save half the kids 2x in a row kills you causing the revive mechanics to fire where you lose some of your items.)There's an aspect of the game of getting to know the villagers that essentially breaks down to giving them the right gifts to raise your friendship bar. I got married to one just before the end of my first game! I'll definitely be playing at least one more full game of this title because the levels are somewhat randomly generated so it has replayability.One full game took me between 5-6 hours."

The art style may be cute but the world is unforgiving - it is very possible to irretrievably trap a child you're trying to rescue, or fail to get to her before a hungry witch or spider does. This is part of the appeal, I think, and also part of the game's theme. Life is hard, and you can't always save everyone. You can't always achieve the things you think you're meant to. I think this is beautiful, but I also understand why they're implementing an easier difficulty level in a future update. The wall most players run into at Year 5 can be very frustrating.The art and music provided by Brent Kobayashi and Daniel Simmons is deeply nostalgic for players of the late MMO Glitch.This is definitely worth playing, though I must confess that before I started playing I had been prone to some gloomy moods already. Occasionally you run into some enemy creatures that whisper things echoing what might already be in your dark thoughts. I think this could go either way for different players - it can be helpful to work through those feelings with the game, or it might amplify them and make you feel a bit worse."

Despite being randomly generated it's open ended puzzles allows players to craft there own solutions while still requiring careful planning to solve.  The addition of an energy system, in which a players hp is deducted when carrrying a object, offers a surprising amount of depth as it encourgages players to play efficiently while introducing another risk-reward mechinic that allows you to skip saving children allowing you to conserve hp and the expense of the resources rewarded.  Central to this is an expansive crafting system in which players combine mobs and objects into unique items.

I really wasn't sure if I'd enjoy the gameplay, as I couldn't really get the feeling from the trailer and screenshots (no doubt a game that would have benefited with a demo). I decided to finally give Road Not Taken a try and absolutely loved it!The art style, characters and dialogues are just adorable (seriously, the little descriptions and dialogues when you talk to the NPC's or give them gifts will give you a warm, fuzzy feeling in your belly). The story is simple, yet nice and poetic (leaving much to be interpreted by the player, which I personally love) and the gameplay is indeed quite interesting. I can't think of another game with a gameplay like this. Sure there are games where you combine items to form new items, but the strategies you need to come up with to move around and not waste energy are something a bit different. Also all the interactions and having to move or run after (or away from!) some of the creatures are an extra challenge. It's fun to learn over time how to combine different items and how they act and react to each other, figuring out cool new strategies. Oh, at first the ending felt a bit underwhelming, but there is more to the game, a more complete ending. Though it's maybe not that special, I felt it was a nice little reward for the effort.Definitely a great game, though I'm sure it's not for everyone.I loved Triple Town (even though the PC version was lacking, unfortunately). So I can't wait to see what Spry Fox comes up with next."

76561198074691072,Recommended,293740,18060918,"Posted: 16 September, 2015",all,Larreate,"Update: after some time (and 74 hours of playing Road Not Taken) I decided to change this review to positive. I still think the game has all failures that I was talking about, but it also has some marvelous merits. Road Not Taken certainly isn’t for everyone but it deserves a try.If you don’t know this already, Road Not Taken is a quite hard puzzle-rougelike game, where you take the role of a ranger, who helps to rescue children. At first your character wear a hooded cloak and you don’t even know how he or she look, but if you start friendship with some villagers (and you better start it, believe me), your character remove a hood and… their look and gender depends of the character who you first become friends with. Like, if you start friendship with the girl in an animal’s hut, you will be girl in an animal hut with random hair and skin color and so on. It doesn’t influence anything in a gameplay, but still it’s a fun feature.Game mechanic is explained in a game itself, so I just go for pros list.Road Not Taken has three aspects that are made it so unique and wonderful: very cute graphic style, characters with their own past, personalities and views of life and the most important – many philosophical aspects and dialogs through the game. Never ever you’ll see such sad, touching and thoughtful dialogs about rice or bunnies, trust me.And now: why I still think that the game isn’t for everyone and you should think twice or thrice before try it. The answer is a quite simple really – Road Not Taken is a hard as hell. There isn’t any “undo” or “replay level” button – if you made a mistake (and you WILL make it a lot, especially in the beginning), than you made a mistake and there is no way to step back. First few levels will be merciful for you and you still can progress even if you made some wrong steps, but the game become more and more hard with each passing level and eventually you get the situation where you grab a wrong item, throw it away and screw it all with a big “BAM!” with a cherry on the top. And now you have to start all over again. At the best case (if you have a backup way with a shrine) you’ll just lost your entire inventory and half of the trophies and start the level once more. At the worst – you have to play all over again with the new character.So in the end I suggest you – don’t look on the cute and marvelous sides, think it over! If you are fan of hard puzzle games and rougelikes – maybe it’s really your wonderful choice, consider to buy it. But if you are the casual gamer and don’t like frustrating experience and whole “screw it all in few seconds with a simple wrong move and start all over again” thing – think again, maybe this game just isn’t for you. I still love and hate it in equal parts even after so much time, that I spent playing it and after completing it three times in row."

Unnecessarily long loading times aside (Especially for a trashy looking 2d game), I booted it up and I have to say, at least it managed to detect my screen resolution correctly. It went downhill from there.First off, the game's locked to 30fps, which is a nightmare. I alt-tabbed out to confirm this with FRAPS, and upon alt-tabbing back in, all of the art assets had been stolen, just like my money when I bought this trash. I was presented with a black screen with just the text overlaid on it.I rebooted it (I have no idea why, I should have just quit there and then), got past the introduction cutscene and mission for a second time, and decided I wanted to turn down the repetitive, irritating soundtrack and noises. Nope. I had two options: On or off. I mean, sure, I could go to the Windows Sound Mixer and turn down the program's sound, but that would mean alt-tabbing out, a ""feature"" this game doesn't support. Shame. I decided to opt with keeping the sound on and just switching from headphones to speakers so I could control the sound there, but I digress.I continued on with my ""quest"" (Can you call it that? I don't think many self-respecting ""quests"" would consist of overcoming a series of mild annoyances), and wanted to see if I could switch from full screen to windowed in the hope that that would let me alt-tab out. Nope. If you want to change between the two you have to reboot the game, something I'd done twice at this point. It might not be a problem, but the game doesn't actually seem to have any clear way of how to save your progress.I carried on, ignoring the plethora of bugs and missing features I'd encountered, into the third room. There are two NPCs in there that you can talk to. I spoke to both of them, listening to their unimportant small-talk (Why did they even include this in the game? It doesn't add anything and it's just infuriating to have to click through). After going through the boring dialogue, I saw something. Huh, there are three badly drawn boys (Hue) on a stage with musical instruments. This looks interesting (Funnily enough this was the first time I'd said this in my half an hour of working through the bugs). I interacted with them and the credits played. I felt a sigh of relief, thinking I'd completed the game and wouldn't have to play any more. Alas, after finishing the credits I just spawned back in the room I was in. Great, I had to play yet more of this. What's that? There's an exclamation mark above the heads of the two NPCs I spoke with before, indicating they have new dialogue. Oh, how exciting! I couldn't wait to hear what they had to say, especially after the thrilling heart-to-heart I'd had with them just minutes beforehand. What *could* have transpired in the time that I was gone?. Oh... It was the same dialogue they'd said before. Either they have Alzheimer's or the game forgot to save my progress before I watched the credits that for whatever reason, the boy band up on stage had access to.Carrying on, I moved onto the next area and finally got presented with a puzzle. I completed the puzzle and teleported back to the town, at which point I was presented with a console, a pause menu, and a ""which mod would you like to play?"" menu. I closed all of the boxes as I didn't recall asking for any of them (Unless Alzheimer's is now contagious, in which case I may have contracted it from the boy band). I tried to move. Nope. I tried to hit escape in order to leave this hellhole. Nope. Nothing was responding and yet again, half the ""art"" assets hadn't even loaded. It was at this point that I hit alt+f4 and decided to remove this broken mess from my hard drive.Oh, did I mention this isn't even a roguelike, in any sense of the word?Honestly, just avoid this.

Its characters with their childlike proportions, animations showing exaggerated emotions from tears to joy, and even its core mission of returning lost children to their parents all achieve a heartwarming feel. The gameplay is tricky without being rage-inducing, and procedurally generated such that the solutions to the obstacles it throws your way never become rote.The game also does an examplary job on the diversity front. Most characters (the protagonist and about two-thirds of the townsfolk) have their appearances randomized from one game to the next, most noticeably in skin tones that range through much of the human spectrum. You choose the main character's gender through a subtle dialogue choice, or can choose not to reveal it at all; whatever you pick, you're free to romance any of the six eligible objects of affection. It's successful and understated, a perfect example for what baseline assumptions of such thingscouldbe--in stark contrast to the usual default of ""straight dude protag woos straight lady NPC in a fantasy world full of white people.""Some past reviews complain about the game's difficulty. I suspect those reviewers played before the recent rebalancing that made a big chunk of the difficulty opt-in. If you stick to the ""normal"" difficulty path and hold on to a paltry bit of resources to spend on checkpoints, reaching the end of a full playthrough (called a ""career,"" fifteen levels' worth) will only take you a few hours. If you don't have a head for turn-based maneuvering puzzles (think Sokoban, Adventures of Lolo, any Roguelike, etc.) at all, then I could definitely understand steering clear, but for the average gamer difficulty is not a concern.My only complaint aboutRoad Not Takencomes on the technical level: for some reason, this very unassuming game grinds along like it's a boundary-pushing video resource hog. Expect to stare at the initial loading bar for half a minute or so each time you play, and stutter for a couple of seconds on scene transitions. Perhaps installing to an SSD might help.Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates the occasional break from washed-out grimdarkness and ultraviolence!"

It is a puzzle game that almost demands you fail at perfection. Redos and Undos would be cheating at the puzzles, it would just become trial and error until you figure it out...and they would have to rename the game ""The Road That Was Eventually Taken"" Sometimes you are going to fail the puzzle and you have to learn to live with that. Most of the frustration is the user's fault. It isn't as if the mechanics of the game cheat you."

Charming handdrawn graphics and at least somewhat interesting backstory developing during gameplay. Very challenging, at least at the start (haven't managed to get further than year 5 yet). The devs estimate around/at least 30 hours to complete the game, judging by the early difficulty it seems very accurate. 200 logic-defying secrets to discover based on combining various items/monsters available in the game (think of somewhat along the lines of Little Inferno).Definitely recommended for puzzle game fans and a must buy IMO if you enjoyed Tripple Town on your phone/PC."

There is a great sense of discovery as you peel back layers of mechanics without having your hand held. The art and sound are both utterly top notch. The procedurally generated levels stay fresh and interesting without feeling too random (very akin to something like Spelunky). And most importantly it’s just a ton of fun. Recommended to anyone who loved Triple Town, anyone old enough to prefer turn taking to twitch, or anyone who likes well made games."

Road Not Taken perhaps buckles a bit under the weight of its lofty pretenses, and gimps itself with far too many concessions made in the name of ""accessibility"" that ultimately violate those same pretenses. But overall, Road Not Taken is creative with its storytelling and offers an unexpected surprise in terms of game mechanics. Sly Fox is showing themselves as an experimental developer who can adapt their style and design into different game formats and genres while never losing their identity. It's not a perfect game, but Road Not Taken  isn't the end of the journey for them, and I'm happy to be along for the ride."

Well thumbs up for that.Also as a ranger you can choose to take off your hood, this will either expose something very cute or something you just did not expect. In other words you can be a man or a woman or something that makes no sense at all.The items and design of the game is very sweet, some stuff that seems 'sweet'  can also kick your but.All in all, just try it.

76561198131701503,Recommended,293740,33404446,Posted: 9 July,all,anotherphysicsgradstudent,"Though I've played a lot o roguelikes, this is my first experience with a RL puzzler, and I found a lot to like.  Starting with the gameplay, the simple starting point of throwing objects around to clear paths and make groups quickly grows increasingly complicated due to the large number of possible item interactions.  However, this is introduced sufficiently gradually that you don't feel swamped by knowledge.  The difficulty curves up well, with early years generally quite simple but the end of the game presenting a genuine challenge.  The fact that you don't need to save every child means that, if you get a really bad map, your game isn't ended.  Finally, breaking the action into 15 years makes this game ideal for short, coffee-break sessions.The story and setting are given much less emphasis, but if you pay attention you to these details you'll be rewarded.  There's a darkness to the game's setting hidden behind the bright visuals.  The game's overall message is also far from cheerful.My biggest gripe was that the controls were sometimes a bit sluggish, which shouldn't be an issue in a turn-based game but occaisionally led to my making unintended moves.  I also found the relationship mechanics a bit tacked-on.In general, though, I'm glad I picked this up.  I wouldn't class it as something you have to experience, but would definitely recommend it."

,Not Recommended,293740,35445940,Posted: 3 October,all,malaisling,"It's a really cute idea but the way they've done the randomization makes it so hard to have fun playing.The puzzles are the biggest thing to the game, but they are completely randomized. The screenshots of the game are totally false, the puzzles they show you are not what the actual puzzles are. The puzzles they show are rare special rooms players can encounter; but the regular puzzles are nothing like those.The regular puzzles are literally just an array of random objects and creatures, dumped into a cluttered room. The puzzle solving element is players loosely trying to figure out how to get one thing to another thing, or get through a cluster of things, or transport one thing to another thing. It is completely unstructured, there is no logic or thought to solving the problem it's just about figuring out the loose way to navigate through the problem by moving things around. It feels totally empty of satisfaction or even stimulation to play because the puzzles are just a jumbled mess of items which are solved by just moving them around until they align in your favour. There's no overarching solution or method, it's just the player moving randomly placed junk around until they force it into the solution they need to pass.Beyond that there's lots of frustrating elements to the puzzles. Some enemies randomly teleport around the map and serve as blockages, they randomly block certain ways everytime you move; how do you get them to stop blocking you, you move around until they teleport to a place that isn't in your way. Pointless, arbitrary design. There's lot of enemies that are borderline impossible to avoid because they instantly hit you if you get remotely close, or they attack inconsistently so sometimes you can pass sometimes you can't. Some enemies blatantly game over you because they instantly teleport you out of the map if they hit you; yet the game can spawn them right ontop of the entrance or near a significant area you need to reach. It's possible for the player to get straight up trapped among objects they can't move, it's possible for objects to randomly not me moveable even though you need to move them to progress, it's possible for random objects to not trigger their primary function which you also need to progress. There are many ways that the game can straight up screw the player over, all because it's randomly generated in such an obnoxious and unstructured way.Puzzles are about finding solutions, randomly generated puzzles like these completely defeat the purpose of this because the solution isn't logical or satisfying to achieve because it's just a loose brute force method found amongst the random.The art and world design, everything thematic feels very nice. The game makes it seem like a side-feature is the ability to talk and bond with the characters around town with this whole; play as an anonymous stranger who is nice to everybody and friendship is spread all around kind of theme.That's what it really seems like, which was sweet, until it suddenly shows that it isn't like that. Certain characters will actually judge and get upset with you if you befriend other characters. So you're running around being nice to every body, having a lovely time then you get told ""Oh, you like THAT person. They aren't one of us, and honestly, I like you less because you are nice to them. We can't be friends anymore."". And suddenly, you're hit with a dose of reality that some humans just suck; in a game that looked like it was about being nice to every body and having fun. So now you feel weird because you just literally were socially judged in a video game, and now you have one less of the few characters to talk to because that one sucks so why would you want to talk to them anymore. They don't want to be your friend anyways apparently. The game deceptively makes it look like it's supposed to be a pseudo-reality where every body is nice and it's all about friendship, then it suddenly brings in reality and ruins the precedent it set. While making it so you have less characters you can bond with now then before.The game also acts like the anonymity of the protagonist is another key feature. Which it completely looks like it is. Then suddenly, you are given the option to remove your hood to show a character what you look like. If you choose to not do this, you cannot increase your relationship with them or any other character until you do. When you do, it destroys the anonymity of the protagonist and their entire atmosphere in the world; and you can't even put your hood back on. Perhaps this is meant to be the protagonist opening up to the townsfolk by showing who they are, but when you actually do it in practice it doesn't feel like that at all; it's just this sudden dialogue option which gates future dialogue options unless you ruin one of the most base themes of the game. So basically, the developers make you sacrifice one of the biggest thematic elements of the game, for a special moment which doesn't actually work in practice, just so you can talk more to the townsfolk.And if you die without activating any of the revival lights beforehand, which the game does not explain, it will flat reset potentially a third or more of your progress towards beating the game. It's not that the game doesn't save unless you use the lights, it's literally just programmed to remove massive amounts of your progress as punishment for dying at all unless you activate that arbitrary and unexplained game mechanic.It seemed like a really great time but once again developers choose contradicting game mechanics. Game includes friendly social interactions, game scorns player for being friendly; protagonist is mysterious and interesting, content is gated until you reveal their appearance; game is about puzzles, puzzles are random jibberish.It only took around an hour to beat half the game roughly, before death reset almost all that progress. So, the unsatisfying and socially upsetting design of the game aside; it's really not even big enough to remotely justify its price."
