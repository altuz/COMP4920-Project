However with the hopes that other people will play, I reccomend it.1) Fun concept2) easy and smooth mechanics3) well designed levelsIf you are interested in trying it out, go post on their forum page.  I check once or twice a week hoping someone will answer my gameday post."

Unfotunately the servers aren't populated much probably due to very little fanfare when the full version released (I bought it during EA) but the community hub is great and workshop support is a wonderful bonus so for $10 it's a wonderful purchase.If you're wary about it then check out reviews and the hub first or consider buying it during a sale.  Personally I like buying 4-packs to give away to friends mostly because it's a great LAN game but also because...well, why not?"

Don Draper,"When I tried playing, directly during a huge sale for a game, there was literally one other person on a 200 ping server. The game's idea is great, but I have no idea if it actually delivers because I can't connect. Literally nobody plays it."

Yeah at the time of writing this review ive played one hour but during that one hour i have faught and won many a battle, and used many a power up. The pick ups are what really make this game shine, the randomness of getting a minigun or an auto cannon can greatly affect how the game will play out later, the chance of getting the pick up which will allow you to become your worshiped plane is a CotW players dream. Another brilliant feature is the linear map design, which focuses the fight into key areas, but also provide multiple storeys of combat for you to fight upon, yet is obviously more suited to those who have acuired the bomb pick up.At a bargin of £1.74 during the summer sale i saved 75% on this baby, which is even batter.Another great feature is the fact that this game is pretty much my entire life in a game, I too spend coutless hours running about with my arms outstrecthed, making both plane and gun noises, running around with my cardboard plane on, and also jumping from worring hights. This has lead to me having to visit A&E on multiple occasions with fractures in my leg, i also ran in to a wall and fractured my cranium whilst aspiring to become a plane. But you see this is why this game is so adequate for people like me, i now no longer have to injure my self, i can merely play the game to get the release that i need, Which at the age of 43 and a half is quite difficult to achieve.I just cannot wait for the sequel to this, just imagine jet fighters, using lock on rockets and other advanced weaponry to take down other plane enthusiasts, you just can't get enough of it can you. By using the word cult in the title those cheeky chappies at north of earth were just foreshadowing the popularity of this, though there isnt manny of us that now play this, we are devout followers to the end.I love you cult of the wind."

The one offical server never has anybody playing, and there are no bots, so there is no reason to play the game right now... shame that such a great concept went to waste :("
,Not Recommended,293840,13297514,"Posted: 9 December, 2014",all,CloudyIce,"Unfinished game before, unfinished game now.Cult of the Wind is a game filled with great ideas but never gained the player base it needed nor did it feel like the developer supported it much.The game is a flop. It had gained decent attention for it's peculiar trailers but that's all.Don't buy this game,"
,Not Recommended,293840,23767655,"Posted: 24 June, 2016",all,AcidPanda,"Cult of Wind presents a comical looking and original gameplay in an over the shoulder shooter.Heck, it looks great since it has Steamworks for map creation so you can whip up your own temple to the sky god. Sadly, the delivery is an absolute nose dive. Whereas most multiplayer games would have several dedicated servers running, Cult of Wind only has one which is empty. Even with it being on sale at $2, I was hoping for some fun only to experience absolute defeat when I saw there is nobody else playing, not even privately hosted servers. It doesn’t help that the developer has done nothing since the game left early access back in 2014.The combination of an inactive player base and a missing in action developer leads me to conclude that this game dead, just like the airplanes that once flew."

The other reviews stating that it is a graveyard are not exaggerations, there are no other people playing this game. I recommend it because it can be really fun when you have enough people on each team. Even if that almost never happens. Buy it in bulk when it's cheap and give some to friends to add to it's malnourished player base."

In the game you pretend to be an aeroplane flying around firing imaginary bullets, come play with me its great.also there are no players and only 1 server, the dedicated main server with a max of 16 people. no one actually plays this game. 15 bucks or how ever much it was well spent come join me"

It is actually a really fun game even if just for a short while (due to its simplicity) and with all the fantastic art deco design and included map editor, really the only thing that's missing is a playerbase (there is an official dedicated server still!). Buy it for your friends, get some snacks and beer and enjoy the feeling of being a mummy pretending to be a plane shooting invisible rounds at others!"
,Recommended,293840,10994419,"Posted: 1 July, 2014",all,shoggofu,"0 hours! That's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I played for like a whole 9 minutes or so lol. (okay, okay it was mostly in the menus :P)http://youtu.be/994kQZScPsQI played Cult of the Wind online for a few minutes (the only other person at the time online disconnected; and there wasn't really much point in me running around alone for any longer) and glanced at the level editor.The game look’s alright. The sound effects didn't sound as ‘pretend’ as I expected i.e. they didn’t sound like people just making sounds with their mouths e.g. ‘pew pew!’You control a person pretending to be a plane pitted against other people pretending to be planes in online matches (at least that's the idea). The match that I played appeared to be in a capture the flag mode.You have the option to customise your character outfit. However at the moment there doesn’t appear to be much in the way of options. When I played there was a single dedicated server. I did not find any other servers. This only option for a server had a ping of 9999. Not sure how accurate that was. I was able to join. But there was only one other person on the server. I had to fiddle around trying to figure out how to spawn and not be in the same same team as the only other player. I was able to experience a dogfight which was amusing. However my opponent soon disconnected and I was left alone on the server. So I took a look at the level editor. I made a box and stuck a flag to it. It doesn’t doesn’t seem to be something that a casual player can just pick up and use.It has some unique gameplay elements that offer a different experience. Potentially this game could be a lot of fun. If you can find people to play it with. But I really find it hard to justify the $15 price tag when I was only able to get a few minutes of gameplay with another person and when there are a lot of good games already out there that are free. I recommend that you wait for a special or for the price to drop if you are really keen to try. A sale will probably also boost the player base so that there will actually be people online to play with.Update:Look's at credit card receipt two days later. Wait I payed $15 USD to play THIS game?Clickherefor more let’s play videos =)"

I had no job, my parents disowned me and my crack♥♥♥♥♥ wife was about to birth my crack addict baby. Things where ruff and I even contemplated suicide after I found out I was diagnosed HIV positive. The days turned into nightmares as my mind was riddled with anxiety in anticipation of the dark days to come. I seeked solice in alcohol and perscription drugs but none of it helped, it looked like there was nothing that could help me. Then, in the midst of the steam summer sale 2015 I saw a multiplayer game about people pretending to be planes, a game about people,people who in the face of adversity said ''no: I will not be brought down by alcohol, drugs and my crack♥♥♥♥♥ wife;I will not succum to societal pressures;I will rise above what is expected of me AND I WILL pretend to be a plane''. Cult of the wind changed my life. I got a new job, my parents have accepted me back into the family and my wife and unborn child were assassinated by a hitman. I've been cured of AIDs and have been discribed as the new Magic Johnson. Cult of the wind can change your life too, just give it a chance.
