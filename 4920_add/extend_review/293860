,Recommended,293860,10206715,"Posted: 23 May, 2014",all,AestheticGamer,"White Noise Online is multiplayer-based Slender-type game, by which I mean it's a horror game where you go around collecting eight randomly placed objects while avoiding a monster that's hunting you. Slenderman isn't actually involved here, and there's some twists to the formula here to keep it interesting, but the baseline is that this is an online co-op Slender-type game, and that fact will either sell you or turn you away from the game.You play as one of over 20 characters in some very dark environment collecting cassettes. Strange statues line the environments, and a strange glowing monster chases you through the depths of darkness, with an intent to kill. However, the story here is rather non-existent, with the only narrative coming from an opening scene before the title screen, and the audio content that plays on the cassettes themselves when you pick them up.The cassettes emit a static sound to alert you that they're nearby, which is helpful to the formula as the stages in this game are bigger than most Slender-type games and the monster is notably more aggressive. One feature kind of cool and creepy about the monster is that he makes appropriately unnerving sounds to both sort of alert you where he is, and unnerve you. It can be creepy to be in a tight-corridor area and not see him, but it sounds like he's right next to you. Staring at the monster will slowly deplete your 'health', and he'll kill you if you let him get too close to you. There are also green-glowing statues placed around the environment randomly, and staring at them or getting too close will have the same effects the monster has (though of course the statues can't move). The statues emit a static-sound similar to the cassettes (though different enough to tell) to lead players to a tricky end.There are four difficulty levels, which mostly determine the difficulty of the monster, how many statues there are, and cassette placement possibility.The game also has a panic-system that's kind of similar to what you'll find in Clock Tower 3 or Haunting Ground. When you are isolated and alone, your character will start panicking (which can be noted when the character starts making panicked sounds and the screen starts acting up), and eventually starts tripping all over the place and making a lot of noise, which attracts the monster. This can be settled by either collecting cassettes, or finding other people.How prone they are to this depends on what character you play as. There are over 20 different characters, and they all have different stats. These are represented by an image for each 'category' (the images can be confusing at first, can read up on what each one means in the How to Play section on the options menu), with a notice of if they're stronger or weaker in this area than other characters (represented by a +1 to +3, or a -1 to -3, if not shown then they are neutral, or default, in that area). Areas effected include sanity (take less damage from the monsters attacks), flashlight battery life (the longer you keep your flashlight on, the more it will flicker and start becoming dimmer and dimmer), movement speed, stamina (for running), scout (the further distance you can get from characters before panicking), evasion (how high you are on the monsters priority list), and more. You only start with four characters, while the other ones are unlocked by playing the game and accomplishing tasks.There's also some fun multiplayer mechanics that are rather well thought-out. Firstly, death. When a player dies, they then become a ghost, which is visible to the living players as a blue silhouette of the character that died. The ghosts can stick around the living players to help prevent them from panicking, or they can go out and scout for cassettes. The ghosts see the level much more brightly than the living do, and they also move a lot faster around the level. However, they cannot see the monster, but can spot cassettes. This can be helpful in downtime and to be helpful even after death. The second feature cool for multiplayer is the results screen, which displays fun information like the total distance each person walked, number of cassettes each individual collected, how many times they were hit by a scare attack and 'screamed', how long they survived, etc., along with a map that shows the routes that each player took during the course of the game.The game currently has six maps, though the devs have noted if it does well they plan to add more. The maps are fairly varied, with themes like tropical island, government base, museum, snowy forest, and the like. There are three different map 'styles', with two maps under each style. The first is big-open levels that have monuments, like the original Slender. The second are closed-spaces interior maps with twisting corridors, rooms, and labyrinth-like structures. The final are 'island' stages, which has parts of levels connected with tunnels, bridges, and the like, with the level segments being separated like islands.This game was an Xbox Live release originally, the main difference in the Steam version right now is that all characters are now unlockable (as opposed to some characters only obtainable by owning other games), achievements, and they've updated the graphics some. This said, more updates may arise in the future to further differentiate it.In short, it's a very confident Slender game, actually one of my favorites. The online multiplayer is fun and well-thought out, and the game still manages to be tense and scary at times. If you like Slender-based games and have wanted or are interested in trying a multiplayer-based version of that type of game, this is it. There really isn't any better, and the game does very well at what it sets out to do. However, if you don't enjoy Slender-type games, or the multiplayer focus doesn't interest you, this probably won't interest you. The game maybe works better in short bursts than long marathons, but it's still a fun little multiplayer horror game."

This slenderman type game is not your typical slenderman game, Most slenderman games that i had played in the past are more of ""creepy"" than anything else, But this game has more jumpscares and ""scary"" more than anything else.I have also tested this game on my macbook pro 2012 and the results werent good at first, the game kept crashing and it didnt work at all.As suggested by WaaghMan  [developer] , updated my mono framework @http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.htmland the game began to even run on ultra graphics.It still has the 6 original maps but as i said before i hope that they can add more maps and a few more characters in the future and possibly even new gamemodes.I Cant wait to see where this game goes from here.Anyway This release is Amazing and they have done a good job porting it over to pc, also this game runs great on mac computers. I highly recommend this game to people who want to play an affordable,fun, co-op, Mac Compatible,  horror game."
,Recommended,293860,10203891,"Posted: 22 May, 2014",all,Cook13s,"There's not much of a story to this game, put simply you and three others investigate different locations in order to discover the truth by collecting tape recorders which contain information. The recording itself is not important, it does add some back story but not needed for gameplay, you must collect 8 recorders while avoiding the evil manifestation that slowly pursues you.Sound familiar? I bet you have. Its very similar to how a slender game plays with the addition to having coop, that said it doesn't mean the game isn't fun, the opposite if for a short while. I would suggest not binging, as you will exhaust all the fun in one play-through. Decent quality graphics and atmosphere, its recommended playing in the dark with headphones and no voice enabled, especially if you are playing with others, you don't want to ruin the experience the first time.I was disappointed that it was another clone of a slender game, I honestly expected something like a polished version of Damned with clue searching and puzzle elements. I do like that tape recorders are randomly placed, so the game stays fresh. The developer missed out with only one monster model, that should have changed it to have a different monster (with different abilities) tailored to a scenario. There's few scenarios but that balances with options to allow you to change how the map is played like difficulty. You have a choice to choose characters each with strengths and weaknesses, that can change the play style, which once again I was hoping the monster would use your weakness against you.Overall, it's a cool coop game but I would preferred a little more content, it gets a pass from me because its five dollars, less with a fourpack.3/5 Add more puzzles like keys to find for locked areas, hidden chambers, etc. More coop elements like requiring people to work together to progress and more locations to play through (No manor/mansion scenario!? Really?) but the core gameplay and the rest of the game is fine.EDIT: NOW WITH LESS TYPOS!"
,Recommended,293860,10204313,"Posted: 22 May, 2014",all,TheHealer,"TL;DR: For the price, why not? It's fun if you're playing with friends and actually scary depending on the level.Played two games with 2 other friends. The first map we played was, I believe, the Chateau? The second was the Area51 type zone.At first I was a little disappointed, we all were. It didn't seem _that_scary to us. Once we quit griping and actually ventured out to find the tapes it started to become a LOT more fun. By far, the most fun came from the closed up, almost labyrinthine, design of the second map. Panicking and losing each other, watching your friends die, having to continue on with their ghosts in tow, it was all so much fun.PROS:The ambient sound is really creepy and lends itself perfectly to the atmosphere.The graphics were decent and definitely worked in favor of the game's target atmosphere. Dark, creepy, and lots of fog so your rendering times are fast and everything runs smooth.The built-in voice chat worked fine and helped out a lot. Usually we use Skype but we decided to let the game do it's thing.The price. I mean come on, 6$? You can't beat that!Being able to continue playing as a ghost after you die was fun. Helped the search.CONS:All veryMINORcomplaints.There are NO subtitles. Nobody in my group could hear almost anything the people on the tape recorders said. It sounded like it might have been interesting too. :(Not being able to see the actual lit up areas from other people's flashlights. It would be nice to let your friends flashlights light up the hallway you're walking down too.Collision was sometimes irritating, getting stuck on some boxes while you're running away. Not much to be done about that, just try to steer while you panic?Tension was slow to build depending the maps. I mean, yeah, a creepy forest is creepy and all, but being trapped down in a bunch of confined hallways is infinitely worse.For first time players, picking a character is irritating because you don't know what the modifier symbols for them do exactly. (Increase speed, decrease sanity) Once you play a game or two, you get it, but at first glance as a beginner it's a tad much."

In this version the graphics are really clear and not scary in my opinion but on the xbox its all fuzzy and has weird static effects, the xbox has a way better scary atmosphere. Also i never see anyone playing this game, i guess if you want to play you'll have to play with a group of friends. On xbox there are so many people playing. Yeah the xbox version is only $1 and this is $5.99 but if more people played and it was worked on better people would buy it."

Monster is actually scary looking.2.The way you find the monster, either through the towers or him just poping up, actuall does suprise you when you first see him.3.They incorperated the ""Don't look and just run"" idea.4. It's a real challenge.5. Dev is great and very helpful, seems to know what he's talking about. Even put up with my stupidity.Cons:1. Somehow managed to make the controls clunky and slidey at the same time.2. A snail could outrun these characters.3. Why incorperate a flashlight if it barely works?4. Really hard to find the cassets.

,Recommended,293860,28321079,"Posted: 11 December, 2016",all,YieldingBusiness,"White Noise Online is essentially an iteration of Slender: The Eight Pages, the goal to walk around a scenario collecting tape recorders, the more tapes you collect the more the difficulty and music ramps up. The more you play the game, the more Investigators you unlock, each with their own pros and cons that are good for different situations. Since this game has since been long dead by the making of this review, don't expect to just happen upon a multiplayer game anytime soon, though the singleplayer is promising enough. The only cons I have against this game is that the shadows don't look right when you get up close to them, the scaling in some parts of the scenarios (which is more evident in the scenario Bunker 51) is way off, and that you just move so dang slow, though Investigators like Hannah and Alex can fix that.Since the concept is very similar to Slender: The Eight Pages, I might as well compare the two. For atmosphere, I say Slender definitely succeeds, as the fact that three other people can be present can demean the atmosphere by a lot. In Slender, the difficulty escelates on its own if you take too long between pages, and while White Noise Online doesn't have this, it can still be very challenging on the Nightmare difficulty once you get far in-game. I'd still go with White Noise Online though, as there are multiple maps, more places where tapes can spawn, and the fact that you can play it with your friends!So in short, White Noise Online is multiplayer Slender: The Eight Pages, but you should only buy it for the singleplayer."

This game is a very basic horror game. You have your flashlight, You can run, and a giant monster chases you around sometimes popping up right in front of you. Also each character has their own traits like one can get scared more without dying or a longer duration for his/her flashlight or can just walk faster but some also have minus some of these things like have a better flashlight but could be very slow. you can adjust your sensitivity to how ever you feel is best (highest to look away from the thing faster).

At the time, it was the best dollar I had ever spent on a digital game because this game is fun . . . if you have friends . . . and if you need to kill small amounts of time. The gameplay is very simple as you walk around searching for 8 tapes while avoiding eye contact with a monster and strange green statues., which is something I actuallly appreciate about WNO.The visuals and music are also simple. That's fine. It makes it easier to see/hear the tapes you need to collect and the monster you need to avoid.It's compared to Slender, and rightfully so. That's also fine. I liked Slender well enough.I'd definitely recommend playing with friends and not taking this game too seriously.However, the asking price is much higher than on Xbox. If, over time, new content is added beyond new maps and characters, then the price may be fair.But, I still bought it and installed it on my Steambox. I had good memories playing it on my Xbox 360 with friends, and want it available on Steam. I will encourage my friends to buy it so I can play with them.If you play alone, either wait for a steep discount or go all-in and buy the 4-pack to take advantage of what makes this game enjoyable - simple, stupid fun with friends.I'll recommend buying it as a small co-op game."

,Recommended,293860,33014256,Posted: 29 June,all,Frank Castle's Black Dong,"What can I say? Let me tell you somethingLove is complete acceptance: When we allow something to be exactly as it is, without any belief that they aren’t good enough, without any belief that they would be “better” if they were different, this is love.Love is completely unconditional: Love has no conditions. When we truly love something, we can’t stop loving it, regardless of what they do or say. If our love is dependent upon the other acting and playing how we want, then this love is completely conditional. We often confuse this to be love, but this is just positive thoughts about something. This is just loving what a thing says or does, not loving it. Positive thoughts or the thought “I love you” isn’t necessary to love. Sometimes it even gets in the way.Love is selfless: True love doesn’t want anything in return, because there is nothing it needs. We just love for the sake of love. When we love something, we don’t look for it to fill our needs, love us back, and all those types of things. If that is what we are looking for, then we are just using the other thing.

Chairs that aren't supposed to be possible to move in unnatural positions and horribly textured surfaces. Leaving you  to say such positive things about the game like my friend who said ""Wow, the best thing about the game is the water.""The controls are so sticky, like your character just bathed in honey. Looking around is a chore and my friends and I found ourselves trying to see who would die first, just so we didn't have to put up with it anymore.I would never recommend anyone to go through the horrible experience I have just gone through.0/10, never publish again.kthx. <3https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGn1ikxPBVs"

Theres just one downside... IT'S ♥♥♥♥ING REPETETIVE! The games gameplay is the same every level and theres hardly any reason for the co-op. I just wish this game was scary and maybe executed a little better but for the price its ok so i would give it a 6/10 (fun for a while until you lived it all)."

If you haven't heard of Slender, then White Noise Online will be a new experience.It's an arcade-esque experience where players run around in the dark in search of 8 tapes while being pursued by an eldritch abomination.The graphics are simple, and slightly cartoony, which helps to make the game more bareable for the easily frightened.The price is good for what you get, although you only need an hour to see all the game has to offer."

No difference at all, though it happens to run very smoothly! As for instance, solo'ing a place on Nightmare without any issue. :)White Noise is a remarkable scary game and the best White Noise out of any others. It's also plenty of fun whenever you've friends or people around to play with. Though the online community currently doesn't have anyone around, I'll continue to stick around to see if I find anybody for a neat match! :)This is a great product, if you're searching for a thrill or perhaps a scary adventure. I highly suggest you only play this game on ""Nightmare Difficulty"" aka the hardest difficulty due to the fact that it's lots of fun. Goodluck out there!"
