76561198012877688,Recommended,293880,12449847,"Posted: 11 October, 2014",all,Evil Jared Hasselhoff,"This game looks like it could have been made in the 90's, and that is in no way a bad thing. All the artwork in the game looks like it was hand drawn and the developers use the minimalist static character design in a great and often fantastically funny way. The gaming world seems so focused on graphics nowadays they forget that graphics simply accentuate a game design, they do not make a game great. A great game touches a gamer's emotions and draws them into the world the designer has created. This game will absolutely suck you in and make you chuckle, chortle, guffaw, cackle, snicker, and maybe even regret (there can be some surprisingly dark consequences to your actions in such a light-hearted game.)So how to describe the game.. I'll start off by saying you will spend most of your time in this game reading. If you don't enjoy reading in your games then I suggest you move on right now. If you do enjoy reading then I highly suggest this zany space opera-esque adventure in which you are a Dark Scavenger! Your spaceship is out of fuel and it is up to you, the courageous Dark Scavenger who will use Your Mother as a meatbag to absorb about a million archer arrows meant for you, in order to save the day! This game plays like an epic game of MadLibs, but instead of just picking random adverbs and adjectives to make a story you will pick from your selection of Weapons, Tools, and Allies to deal with events that pop up, often resulting in laugh out loud situations. How do you get those weapons, tools, and allies you may ask? Well the game is broken into chapters. At the beginning of each chapter you will start with some sort of event in which you choose from a few dialogue choices. After an event ends there is a strong chance you will get some sort of weird object generously called ""loot"". After the event ends you'll be looking at a map of scenery in which you can point and click on various objects on the map. Clicking on those objects can often trigger events and lead to more loot, so scan that map closely! After you have found everything on that map there will be arrows you click on to lead you along to the next part of the map. After you click the arrow, if you found any loot, you will briefly be whisked away back to your three space alien buddies who happen to be excellent crafters. Lucky you. You will then turn your ""loot"" over to one of the three crafters and they will offer some sort of funny explanation to what weapon, tool, or ally they will create for you. Now that you have your real loot, what do you do with it? Well when you happen upon an event you are usually given several options of how you wish to deal with it, and are almost always given an option to use a weapon, tool, or ally to help you out. In each chapter of the game you only have X amount of uses of any given weapon, tool, or ally, so choose wisely (I found myself choosing by how funny I thought the result would read!) You do regain the uses in the next chapter though, so don't be afraid of using what you need to use. You'll work your way around the map from room to room in such a manner, gaining loot and power until you reach the end of the chapter where you'll face a boss.I've had such a blast playing through this game, and there is a New Game + mode so you can go back through the game and hand the loot over to different crafters than you did the first time so there is good replayability. Highly suggested for anyone who would enjoy reading about a wacky sci-fi adventure in which you create funny situations based on your actions in your epic quest for fuel and salvation from an ominous universal being. Worth every penny and I wish there were more adventures like this."
,Not Recommended,293880,11647435,"Posted: 10 August, 2014",all,Trip Fisk,"updating review. evidently some people find my review helpful.The ""no"" is for the base price. $5 could buy you a lot better. Its too much for the kind of game Dark Scavenger is. Even getting the game on sale at $2.50 feels a bit like a gyp.  Dark Scavenger, and I know I'm going to get crapped on for saying this, feels and looks a lot like a flash game you could play for free on newgrounds. Hell, you could watch a playthrough start to finish on youtube and not lose much of the experience of actually playing it. There's not much to it.First: some people keep insisting Dark Scavenger is part jRPG. This is untrue. The closest the game gets to being a traditional jRPG is having menu driven combat and that's it. There's very little RPG about Dark Scavenger. It is almost entirely a choose your own adventure point and click game.Dark Scavenger is a real one-note game. Its very search about the screen for things to click on, an event triggers, fight maybe, ""scavenge"" an item, and craft it into equipment to use in events/fights. That's really all it is. Lather, rinse, repeat.There's no real challenge. There are only bad guesses at what to do during an event. The battles themselves are similar in that while you may choose the best weapon or item to use against enemies, luck usually plays role in how effective they are if they work at all.The sole thing Dark Scavenger has going for it is the writing. What the game lacks in depth, it makes up for with screwy odd-ball over the top writing and art direction which is usually amusing and adds a great deal of charm. Sadly, that's really the only thing Dark Scavenger has that's any good. That's what most of the positive reviews are raving about."

However it is far diffferent than just another RPG game.To describe Dark Scavenger then I would state it is a point n click RPG game with twists of comedy and bizareness.  When encountering enemies in this game there are plenty of other means to rectify the situation.If you love RPG games and love to laugh while also being able to make choices in this game, then stop reading and go buy it!"

Don't be fooled by the UI – it's better to think of the game as a descendant of text-based adventure games. And the great writing does glue everything together. It will have you giggling, or, in those moments that the game has sufficiently worn down your defenses, laughing uproariously. Definitely a cult classic – I would have loved to have played this game when I was still a kid!"
76561197993728166,Recommended,293880,13152812,"Posted: 29 November, 2014",all,Tarious,"I put this game on my wishlist after seeing it on the sidebar and seeing how it looked interesting, it looked like this space game I saw in a magazine when I was a kid (tried looking for the name of the game, but couldn't find it), So I thought I'd eventually buy it down the road expecting it to be a somewhat mediocre game that'll give me a few hours of gameplay. Well, the game went on sale with the Thanksgiving sale, bought it for almost 3 bucks, and stayed up all night playing it, it was that good.You play an alien that's stranded out in space, who soon comes across a galactic being who wants to consume you. After defeating him you're left to rot in space for years and eventually you're picked up by a group of aliens called the Dark Scavengers who are pretty much intergalactic junkers who invite you to join their crew if you can help them by finding a fuel source for their ship. This leads you to going down to the nearest planet full of your typical medieval fantasy setting including a race of giant masked wrestlers, crazy drunk bandits,  and an armored smart♥♥♥♥♥space raptor with a giant gun who wants you dead.The story for this game is absolutely amazing. There are constant twists in the story, characters that you get emotionally invested in, and even extremely interesting concepts that get explored. Each character has their own personality and always has you wanting to learn more about them. You'll constantly be laughing at the crazy situations and humorous characters you find yourself interacting with.Unlike Mass Effect 3, your choices actually matter in this game. You can kill everything you come across right away, or talk to them and get useful items and information or even backstabbed. There's several different endings depending on what you do in the final chapter.The combat is a bit different from other rpgs. There is no leveling up in this game. Combat is focused around finding objects through battle and having the dark scavengers turn them into either weapons, items, or allies. The vast majority of objects (i'm talking around 95%) have multiple options on what you can turn them into. You may find a bone that you can turn into a weapon that does wind damage, a controller which increases your damage for the next turn, or a zombie ally. You may only choose one of these, and you can't go back on your choice. All items, allies, and weapons have a certain number of uses before they break, and you won't get to use them anymore till they replenish at the start of the next chapter, making it so you have to have a balanced between all 3 categories. The only flaw in this system is that the majority of the time the Dark Scavengers don't give you good hints on what they're about to make for you.Combat is done with you going first followed by all enemies. You can stun enemies using elements they're weak against, which loses them their turn, allows you to use stuff that's strong vs stun against them the next turn, and refills your healing potion (restores you to full health when you click it). Enemies are even strong vs certain elements which makes them take little damageAlso all weapons, items, and allies have different characteristics. A weapon might be a long bladed weapon or a short blunted staff, or fast strong ally. You may run into an event (events happen regularly) which you need a long bladed weapon to attack with, or you may get stuck in a whirlpool which you need a strong ally to help you out. There are also weapons and allies that effect certain enemies, like ones with their mouths open or enemy with their feet on the ground. This adds a lot of uniqueness to the game.The game takes about 4 and a half hours to beat, but once you do you get access to New Game Plus. Once you beat it you'll be wishing that there was a sequel to continue the story (which the ending sets up for). I honestly recommend buying this for full price, it's only 5 bucks, but you'll more than get your money's worth."
76561198167454344,Recommended,293880,16277073,"Posted: 9 June, 2015",all,InsomniacFluton,"I cannot recommend this game more highly. It may not be suitable for those who like bells and whistles and constant blood. But for the discerning adventure/rpg enthusiast, Dark Scavanger offers a fresh and satirical take on the genre while casting eyes back to the days of early crpgs.The mechanics are simple, but beneath the point and click interface interesting choices can be made. Some choices are available depending on whether you have the right weapons, equipment or allies. You acquire these items by finding artifacts as you uncover the mysteries of the planet below. One of three aliens aboard the ship you reside – Kamaho an undead weapons master, Falsen a greenish trickster, and Gazer a mute and very alien alien – will forge the artifact into something unique.Story and writing are the main selling points of Dark Scavenger. I won’t spoil it by going into detail. Enjoy the humour, quirkiness and silliness of this inventive and imaginative journey that you won’t want to end. I wish more games were like this."
76561198141404871,Recommended,293880,17345440,"Posted: 1 August, 2015",all,joan4003,"This game in many ways reminds me of Zork minus the art work (now that will date me - Zork as far as I know was the first actual computer game; a text based choice adventure, played on a mainframe, back in the day when one needed punch cards and PCs did not really exist, circa early 1980s).  I digress.  Dark Scavenger is a bit point and click, a bit hidden object, a bit text based D&D choice driven adventure with quite a bit melee mixed in using the crafted weapons, items and allies one has managed to scavenge and a whole lot weird.  Odd characters, even stranger allies, and relatively conceited enemies make this game uniquely interesting.  This game seems simpler then it actually is, and dying can happen easily by making wrong decisions or choices.  Choices really matter, especially in combat where melee attacks are limited to what weapons one has available to use.  Hopefully along the way one has made the correct decisions on who to craft with, where one has looked for items, what information one has managed to gather and what action has been taken in a situation.  As I stated before this game seems far easier then it actually is and requires thought and planning to get through.  Though I did not pay full price, I would have.  The price is worth it for a game that is ... as Monty Python would say ... ""and now for something completely different"" because it is ""completely different""."

The gameplay is point and click with rpg elements; meaning you can choose navigation, finding clues to defeat enemies/bosses and whatever loot you find can be shaped into a weapon, item or ally (each with its own quirky title and definition).

76561198110519399,Recommended,293880,16205568,"Posted: 5 June, 2015",all,Ckh,"When I first saw a youtuber play this game one year ago, I found it to be quite intriguing and very much to my liking. More specifically, the gameplay and art direction. Unfortunately, I did not have the funds to buy the game myself and only bought it a few days ago upon discovering a location to buy steam cards.After finishing this game, I feel tempted to write a good review for it. Here's a few reasons why:Unique gameplay: The gameplay of this game is akin to a interactive book combined with a video game with the point and click exploration element added to the mixture. Basically, you click stuff, engage in battles and obtain loot. Loot can be used to craft special items and it also depends on the crafter you choose. Kamaho, the skeleton ""warrior"" will make weapons for you. Falsen, the green goblin looking guy will create wacky items for you and Gazer, the alien thing will summon or make allies for you. This adds quite a bit of replayability to the game (especially with the new game plus that allows you to keep all your items from your previous run). Choices that you make impact the game in small ways but never really diverge from the main linear plot line of the game. As such, making certain decisions may result in obtaining ""extra loot"" or just some extra details about the world you are exploring.Plot: The plot is kinda that a science fiction adventure. You are stranded in space after a battle with a mysterious creature called ""Den"" and wake up to find yourself in a spaceship with three aliens on board. The aliens request for your help in obtaining fuel to sustain the ship and you somehow find yourself accepting the quest. The rest of the game is just exploring the world to find the mentioned fuel.Apart from that, the storytelling sometimes takes on a dark humour like tone (with Juno (some random person you meet twice or thrice) lying dead on the floor in the next area with no prior explanation.) which could be quite entertaining to read. Overall, the storytelling is splendidly done to resemble an actual storybook and I find myself having no faults with it.Art:The artstyle is simply amazing. It resembles the artstyle of video games in the 1990s while also looking like a picture book. Keep in mind that my opinion about the artstyle is subjective as I really appreciate old school artystyles.Music:The music is quite fitting with the battle scenes and the game itself. Not much else to say about it really. (P.S. I can't really good a decent comment about music in general)The only con I find with this game is that it is a little too short and I would had liked to explore more of this world. Nevertheless, this is still a very good game and I would recommend you to try it.Rating:8.5/10"

The choices were not open ended, leading either to instant death, progressing in some way, or devious later instant death when you missed something important on an earlier page. The progression was linear, and while it branched somewhat, the roads taken would crystallize into one or two endings, depending on the length and complexity of the adventure. As with any genre of book, game or book/game hybrid there were categories of both comedy, high adventure, gloomy dunkelkeit and of course some smut <3Some books in the genre were single quest deals leading the player down exotic locales or dark environments. Others came in sets that followed a linear progression between books, each new installment assuming you completed the earlier ones.This game is very much the first cathegory of adventure book where the story is exotic, strange and stand-alone. The player faces off in space versus a cosmic monstrosity easily dominating them and taunting at their demise. In the nick of time the player is saved by three very strange aliens who introduces themselves as ""dark scavengers""; looters of planetary energy, forever traveling and therefore always looting. As their newest member (and the only one who can fight) you are sent down to a nearby world where planetary energy can be harvested. This is where the game begins.The game is divided into a series of levels that, in turn are divided into a set of ""rooms"", similar to an adventure book's pages. Each room has a couple of challenges for the player to attempt, yielding loot when successful and damage or other penalties when not. Items aquired can then be used to solve subsequent challenges, awarding the player with an ever larger array of solutions to problems.And what solutions they are! As for the first set of categories a CYOA could be mentioned to have this game is very much in the comedy section of things. Instances, combat, and even crafting your gear is all permeated with a stellar sense of humour that will have you staring at the screen in disbelief and glee. The world is interesting! The characters inhabiting it are funny! The comical timing is spot on! But aside from being witty, the game is above all else smart.Now how can I explain that..?*SEGMENT IS SLIGHT SPOILER OF GAME MECHANIC THAT IS FUN TO DISCOVER FOR YOURSELF*Well, for starters the game makes the best of its newfound tendency towards the game part of its Book/Game hybrid existance. Say for example that you face of against a bandit and combat ensues. Normally in an adventure game, and in some types of rpg's where the action keyword is absent from its genre title, combat would take place through the taking of turns, opponents slugging each other untill abilities come into play. So too here, but with a twist. Knowing the player can only experience the world through still images, items (used both for combat and environmental encounters) all react to the way a character looks. In his still picture, the bandit is jumping towards you with an axe in hand and with a crazy snarl on his face. In this case, the dentists drill will deal huge amounts of damage since his teeth show, the wind bag will stun him since he is up in the air, and the magnet will take his weapon, weakening him. Of course it would be silly to assume the bandit is always jumping in the air with his mouth open rendering him forever vulnerable to our very situational items. Lucky for us however the game figures its silly rules is better than realism it couldn't fake anyway :>*END SPOILER*Long, less spoilery story short; it plays around with genre conventions and mechanics as well as being genuinely humorous.Dark Scavenger is one of those games where you would like to see more of the world and the characters that inhabits it, but somehow know that to experience them in any other way than this specific game's would somehow spoil the magic. The game never lets itself get old and is surprisingly varied both in terms of difficulty, encounter types and tone. It leaves itself open for an impossible sequel but still somehow feels complete, like an expensive meal where the only regret after finishing it is not being able to have it again.♥♥♥♥♥♥ that got kinda pretentious. I guess what im trying to say is that the game itself and the way it constructs its narrative and mechanics is in itself part of the joke, and trying to do it again would, as with all good jokes, leave sort of a hole of anti impact that would suck part of the punchline away.Its like nothing. Costs basically nothing as well, so don't take my word for it. If you felt even a little compelled to check it out after reading this or the opinion of others I would say go for it! It will have you entertained in that ""ah good times"" way where you remember it later with a smile.Sountrack´s nice too. and FYI it is about 6 hours long."

You have some click-to-make a choice dialog boxes but I didn't see any lasting consequences -- at least not until I got bored and quit. It's a slow paced-game, kind of repetitive. You collect items which get crafted into weapons, boosters, and allies which you fight with -- all of the above have limited uses so you need to manage what you have to get more items.But the game never grabbed me.

It's basically a choose your own adventure gamebook type of game with interesting and quite unique mechanics. It is very heavy on text, so you'll have to read a lot while playing it. The game asks you questions from time to time to check if you actually payed attention or just clicked through everything without reading. Like in a gamebook, the text is really the whole point of the game, so that would be quite pointless indeed. What is very unusual for a computer or video game is that apart from very few typos the writing is absolutely excellent. Neither childish, nor deliberately opaque, the author has a very enjoyable and literate writing style. The orthography and the grammar were also excellent. Why can't every adventure game be like this? The story is original and refreshing, and the game has a subdued kind of humour that mainly comes across in the quirky graphics rather than in the text. Playing through Dark Scavenger takes a couple of hours, somewhere between 5 and 10 typically. Having done this once, I don't think it is very replayable. You can always try to do better to collect all items and solve all the puzzles, but apart from this the story is very much linear. When you play it for the first time, a large part of the fun in Dark Scavenger is the fact that you often don't have the slightest idea what is going on. Once you finished it, you will surely have figured that out, so this excitement is also lost on later playthroughs.If you like adventure games at all, I really recommend buying and playing Dark Scavenger, especially if you can get it in a bundle or a sale for one or two euros."

For example, nowhere in the game explains how the save mechanics work. Basically, all your actions are autosaved, BUT, you can do ""manual autosave"" by existing the room and going back in again. But as I said, the game didn't bother to tell you this important feature, so I had to restart the whole area many times before I figured out the system. The low score I gave is also reflect upon the unbalanced weapons/items/summons, and low quality art, and also the lack of new elements in NG+."

I'm eager to continue playing. You scrap with ""the apex of eternity"" in the opening encounter and then wake to find that you've been picked up by Dark Scavengers. They enlist you to find a new power source for their (and now your) ship - they will aid you with equipment. Of course, you find the planet that you intend to drain of resources has a host of issues for you to deal with. The writing/lore is outlandish; the humor isn't forced (not necessarily effective, but it won't exasperate, as many other ""quirky"" games will).The art is very fantastic(al); I wish there was a gallery of all the images. That lore; I've yet to figure if the characters/creatures were ideas first and then illustrated, or if they began as doodles and then some background was affixed to further substantiate - a cosmic Zeno Clash is how I'd describe it all (though not nearly as ""*puff puff* Bro, wtf."").The system is interesting:There are different areas in each Chapter (i.e. Level).Upon entering a new screen, there is always an event. After the event, you click about the screen on highlighted points of interest; leads to more events.Sometimes you gain Items from these events; sometimes you can choose to lose(/use) Items (i.e find someone: ""My legs are busted, could you have one of your Allies carry me home? (Could you also have another Ally carry my items? (Could you also have another Ally carry my wares?))"") - there are choices to be made (usually either good or bad, but sometimes there is a third option); have yet to really come across any consequences (again, 1.3 hrs - a few screens into Chapter 2).Upon leaving a screen, you're beamed back up into your ship (which you share with three fellow Dark Scavengers). They can convert the items you've found into either Weapons, Items or Allies. Each of these have a certain number of uses before they are depleted; once you make it to a new Chapter, your Health as well as all charges of all equipment are recharged.DEFINITELY worth the sale price, and I've little doubt it's worth the retail price - length will determine that (there are multiple endings, though, so).I TOTALLY recommend Dark Scavenger."
