It all sounds nice and straightforward and indeed the first voyage breaks you in gently with simple obstacles to build up your confidence.DO NOT BE DECEIVED.By the time you reach the expert voyage you will have worked out 3 things.1) Digital input requires very precise timing.2) The developers hate you (I can only assume a traumatic incident in a geometry class).3) You definitely aren't coming back to beat that high score...at least not for the next half hour.The game is a lot of fun when you hit the zone but be prepared for frustration along the way."

,Recommended,293900,29254968,Posted: 14 January,all,Edd,"Vib Ribbon was an interesting game. You controlled a wire rabbit and walked through a course which was generated based on the music that was playing. Pivvot is a game in a similar mould, though there are more varieties of obstacles and a character that is considerably less designed than Vib Ribbon’s protagonist – in this game, you are little more than a couple of dots with a line connecting you.This is part of what makes Pivvot so enjoyable. It’s so simple, there are no stunning, high-def graphics to distract you from the game, nor is there a story to get bogged down with. You literally just have to guide a little balloon down a line without hitting any of the obstacles, while listening to some pretty fantastic music. The tendency of developers to make games all singing and dancing of late is not always a positive, as it can stretch the game a little too thin. Fixpoint Productions stayed away from that idea, took a very basic game and made it worth playing.Read more at the Video Game Almanac"

You are pretty much through both guided levels in <= 60 minutes. Then you got the same stuff in endless mode. The only funny thing is looper and I got bored of it because it gets also very monotonous. I thought there be a ton more different obstacles than just two dozen or so.""Don't mistake simplicity for a lack of challenge""? The challenge lies in the controls because every button push sends the circle flying a thousand miles an hour. Of course there's the option to decrease sensitivity. Too bad you need fast movements to get past some obstacles... If only it was possible to control with the real mouse, not the mouse buttons?!""Truly sadistic""? Indeed, after one hour I already have the feeling the song from the trailer comes straight from hell.""Tests your ability to make quick impulsive decisions""? There are only 30 or so obstacle types. Once you got them down, you're set. And they're even spaced far apart. So there really is no impulsive decision on a more dynamic board than I would have expected.Overall, I can see why some people really like the game, but I would not recommend it.

76561198021570752,Recommended,293900,12089052,"Posted: 13 September, 2014",all,Orylen,"Pivvot is certainly an interesting game with simplistic controls that make an addicting experience. With this game possessing obstacles and game modes that demand twitchy reflexes, you can inevitably be so close to your goal, when suddenly you hit the wrong direction and ruin your great run. However, when you do reach your goal, your heart might just be racing in your chest from a surge of adrenaline and maybe nerves.While Pivvot might give these feelings to players, some might find that there is little to be had once you unlock and play all of the modes at least once. There are 8 modes, with the 2 voyage modes (Normal and Expert) suggested to be the main modes, displaying a sort of progession in difficulty as more obstacles are introduced in waves. It is a good progression, as you must successfully dodge each obstacle a set number of times before you continue, and are then incorporated into the regular waves.Outside of these two modes, there are endless modes for both voyages, just to see how long you can last, displaying the obstacles in order of how they appear, and also Random Endless modes, throwing obstacles at you as the game pleases. The further you get in these modes, the faster the speed gets as well, increasing difficulty as well. These modes do not really add all that much to the variety of the game, because once you understand the patterns for avoiding said obstacles, it simply becomes an endurance test.Pivvot also contains 2 other modes, Berserk and Looper. Berserk is a crazy avoidance mode that is very fast at the start, and presents scattered obstacles around that require your best abilities to get through. I find that this mode may not be for everyone who gets this game, because players might not be able to get very far, possibly only a couple of seconds, causing frustration. Looper, on the other hand, is a rather fresh mode compared to the others, looking for how many rotations you can do before you get hit. All of the other modes focus on getting through obstacles to continue on the track, but Looper changes focus by having obstacles float by you, with nothing in your path on the actual track. The better you do at Looper, the higher the difficulty becomes, and the obstacles and points you get.Overall, this game is certainly enjoyable, but I give a very tentative recommendation. The music that this game has is rather cool and enjoyable, and allows for tension to ease a little bit, but this game is not for everyone, and it may not keep a player's for more than a couple minutes at a time, and should be played in short bursts due to the potential of feeling stressed because of the twitchy gameplay. I'm not sure if it is even worth the $5 price tag, as half of the modes are lackluster variations of the 2 voyage modes. If you seriously consider giving this shot, it would be good to wait for a sale, or possibly get lucky with acquiring a coupon."

Basically your ball runs along a rail and you either use left or right clicks to rotate your ball in order to dodge incoming obstacles. You only get a small window of opportunity to look at the obstacle ahead and decide which way you need to rotate which is very fun and keeps you on the edge of your seat, not to mention as you get further into a level the obstacles always change so you can never get used to dodging just one type of obstacle.

Since I have it, everytime a friend is at my crib i'll let him test it, see who's got the high score at first try. After you passed first level there is still a lot to play in other modi, so quite good lifespan for a tiny game ! At that price it's a steal !"

Steam hooked it up with a coupon for this game and I had to get it. Get this game w/ soundtrack bundle if ya can.Warning: This game will make you spontaneously dance, especially when youre on a roll."

Not two games are the same, and even when you die the voyage changes, so there is no memorizing it just rolling with the punches."

If you're not driven by either achievements or high scores, then this might not be for you. Also if you're tempted by the low number of achievements and are looking for an easy 100%, then this isn't it.Very addictive, very frustrating, and very satisfying when you finally beat the last high score/get that achievement."

I was unfortunately not able to get multiplayer working because it was detecting a 3rd input device on ""player 1"" that did not / does not exist. However me and the wife found a single player journy to be easily shared using seperate controllers, and it was quite fun. Will I extract more then an hour or two off the game? Probably not. But it was $5, and I will probably whip it out once every few months when friends stop by."

,Recommended,293900,33726929,Posted: 22 July,all,thagenesis,an easy to learn but hard to master gameplay loop with only two mouse buttons to avoid obstacles and sometimes frustrating when you die over and over in the same place but that rewarding feeling when you finally master it is just priceless and totall< worth it. it's hard but fair and it's always 100% your fault when you die. additionally the great soundtrack also keeps you hooked. highly addictive!
