Players are expected to figure out how to kill the bad guy by combining and interacting with various objects within a level. The main problem with this game is that the behaviours of each individual object isn't immediately clear, which prevents players from being able to efficiently plan a strategy. Add to this that the bad guy never shows a clear direction or path, and the result is a game that fails in making the player feel clever in any possible way."

,Recommended,293940,12404035,"Posted: 7 October, 2014",all,cetx,"This is a cool, slick, puzzle game that reminds me, in a way, of something like World of Goo. Except a lot bloodier.It is heavily based on physics, because the goal is to create elaborate Rube Goldberg style traps that ""accidentally"" kill the current target. You get extra points for being particularly inventive, and if you get caught then you lose the round.This is a fun, [darkly] whimsical and cynical game. One of those that you'll fire up intending to only play for 15 minutes and then end up spending 3 hours at."

,Recommended,293940,22587386,"Posted: 23 April, 2016",all,DolgVlaPet,"It's a puzzle game.You set up a series of traps and obstacles on a course of your target in order to lead him to the kill-zone, where you plan to whack him. It's pretty fun and it gets way more challenging after a while... Use your creativity and planning. Study your objective route, set up your ambush and strike in the right moment.It's a decent game and I give it a 7/10."

76561198030978104,Recommended,293940,11459980,"Posted: 28 July, 2014",all,Tylermcd93,"So let me just say that I LOVE THIS GAME. Here is why I love it. It requires thinking, has a very good sense of humor that is dark and quirky. Basically there are 66 levels, (possibly more for all I know) which has a sort of angry birds type of system, where every level you try to complete the object (kill the bad guy) and earn all the stars, (five to six for each level.) You must kill the bad guy in each level by making it look like an accident and trying not to get caught by civilians, police, cameras, or the target himself. It's very much a puzzle game, where you must think of a way to kill your target with what the level presents you. I feel like this game is sort of speaking out with how our government treats criminals, by treating them better than they deserve, when really they just be killed rather than try to weasel out of their consequences and live peacefully under government protection. Lastly the music, the music is also pretty good, surprisingly. It's alot of fun and definetely worth the 15 dollars."

,Recommended,293940,14397730,"Posted: 8 February, 2015",all,-PEves-,"The concept behind this game is simple. The title says it all. There is a bad guy who you have to kill by any means possible. This game has a simple to use mechanic which makes it entertaining and fun. I put 102 minutes into it which is probably about the extent of what I see myself getting out of it. It is a good mildly entertaining game. I don't see it being replayable. It can get a bit bland. The creative concept behind it is good and cool. Everything is kept simple. You don't have to put a lot of thought into it and it is great for a laugh every so often.Graphically I think the game could use some textures. The models are black and white with red blood effects. and basic colors on some main items and explosions. Aside from that everything is white for the most part with little to no textures. I know this is the style of the game and it is how the developer intented to design it, but I think it would look a lot more lively if they took the time to actually texture it better.The game was good for an hour and fourty minutes of mindless entertainment I will give it that.Rating: 8/10"

You often find yourself thinking : I want to kill him like this, but you have no other option.All the ""bad guys"" are the same, no specific behaviour form one to another. I don't play multiplayer, and I can't remember if devs were talking about the multiplayer mode when I bought it years ago...A good game, but very very repetitve. To buy on sale. 10€ is a bit expensive for the content by now."

,Not Recommended,293940,10283439,"Posted: 30 May, 2014",all,[|||] Magnum Force,"Let's be honest, with the current price tag this game is a bad dissapointment. Basically it's nothing more than a puzle game and not a creative killing game. The background of the victims doesn't mean a thing either, which would have been a nice addition if you could use their own crimes against them.On the other hand, it's well made. The graphics are good, the sound is acceptable and there's a bit of replay value. Not much, but there's.Would I buy this game again, with the information I've got after buying and playing? That's a bit of a paradox, but no, I wouldn't buy it.The reason for it is the price and the plane puzzling aspect of the game. I was hoping for a little Garry's MOD massacre style game, but, that's not going to happen."

Also, the multi-player has loads of bugs, kind of freezing and loads of aura-kills.POSITIVE: The concept of the game is not so bad : you need to create your own justice and kill all the bad guys. You have a little selection of languages and the game is not hungry in memory.THE GRAPHICSThey're not bad but not so good. White & Black are the most used colors in here. Only the blood and ""the Bad Guys"" are well made. Even with an high perfomance engine...CONCLUSIONOnly buy this game at the special offers, if you already know (a bit) the game and if you're just going to play for maximum 5 hours. After that, it's really boring."

,Not Recommended,293940,16660410,"Posted: 23 June, 2015",all,ElevenMink3,"First I want to say the point in the game is to use interactable items in the environment to do something to kill the bad guy. Ex. starting a car to crash into him, or swinging a wrecking ball into him.I'm afraid I just don't personally LOVE this game, mostly because its levels are just REALLY hard. It will often give you items and doesn't tell you very well how to use them, and sometimes you don't even know you CAN use them. Because of this, I can't really even get past the third level.Of course, there IS a way past the levels, it's just extremely hard (to me), and I dunno what I'm doing in this game, so what I've said is all I can tell you. I would suggest downloading the demo to decide for yourself. I just jumped ahead and bought the full game because it was on sale and looked good.so 6/10 wud smash a dude with a wrecking ball agin"
