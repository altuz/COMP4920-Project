I'm really impressed with the content they keep churning out through the Early Access process.I was satisfied with the game before they added Juggernaut play style and Ripper power up but holy smokes those two things make the game awesome!Four player action is my favorite.  I can't wait to give it a shot with eight of my buddies!

76561198028641925,Not Recommended,294000,30976939,Posted: 6 April,all,Marrt,"Basically this game is one Analog Stick + one Button, this sums up the combat mechanics it offers. If you like decent instakill Brawlers with pickups you might wanna try this, for me the combat doesn't really offer anything interesting:-you either get a ranged kill you can't properly aim because your running direction is your aim direction-you run up to your opponent to test who has the better better-hitbox-range-timingWhy not offer some expert modes with extended controls? A one-button top-down game begs for twinstick shooting mechanics, backing of while facing your opponent would add so much depth.I accept that these Partygames should be super accessible, but the gameplay is just too dull for me.The challenges are tedious or boring:-Worms:I had no idea what to do vs the worms, they first appear only stunned so i tried to hit them during stun which did nothing. They didn't seem to suffer any visual damage nor did they got shorter so i thought i only stun them. The key was to stun them just a few times which made me go ""ok, fine, whatever"" after beatin the challenge. The worms just move randomly without considering you so it does not feel like a combat-Trolls:just boring-Crystal Hydra:Tedious! running back and forth the entire arena everytime for the swap is just unfun, the bullet-hell is a bit challenging but you only die to it if you want to kill more than 3 heads in one go (because its tedious). The blue orb is barely visible or advertised the first time so it felt like a cheapshot then.-DragonsThis is not a challenge-Dark KnightsHere is where you can extensively train the hitbox timings (if you can endure the waiting periods between deaths and the completely useless unskipable countdown at the start) but it also shines light on why the combat is so dull for me"

We planned on playing a bunch of games but ended up playing just this for most of the day. It's very fun! We played a variety of game modes in the afternoon and mostly just played Last Man Standing in the evening, as we perceived that one to be the most fun. We only didn't like the football one.Some criticism though:We were playing with 4 people and filled the remaining 4 slots with bots. Bot difficulty was a bit iffy. On higher difficulties bots have excellent timing with their sword swings, making them practically impossible to beat in toe-to-toe melee combat. However, even on Extreme difficulty the AI is still dumb as bricks, so if given enough freedom you can easily outsmart them. This makes the optimal difficulty vary a lot between game modes. For example, modes like Arms Race which just focus on killing as fast as possible were best played on regular difficulty, while on Last Man Standing even on Extreme difficulty the bots struggled to keep up with the players."

76561198120586201,Recommended,294000,24627091,"Posted: 30 July, 2016",all,The End is Nai,"So I will start by saying this I bought this game while ago when It was on sale, and I have to say this game has far exceeded my expectation, and as a testimate I think I have a little over 30 hours logged in the game. There are a few bugs admittedly, but none that hinder the gameplay in anyway as far as I could tell. The game has a variety of gamemodes meaning you can keep the fun going for hours, and especially with friends no game is ever the same.The single player challenged are difficult but not impossible. And I feel as though they have provided a difficult yet enjoyable challenge, and even on easy the higher level challenges require patience, and well timed strike before the enemy returns fire. I especially had trouble with the attack pattersn of the cell/plantdragon hybird challenge. There is hours upon hours of content here even with no friends, as the bots in certain games can easily compete and overwhelm the players.I have a list of things I feel as though would benifit the games popularity, and while I know that suggestions are always easier said than done here is my list of suggestions.-A mace like weapon that swings around hitting enemies in a circular pattern.-An upgrade for the recently added spike sheild that once two have been obtained you can shoot spikes from it(when standing still)-A map editor allowing users to create their own custom levels.- More map diversity(I know the maps have to be symetrical 8 ways but I think obstacle diversity could be interesting.-A spear weapon that you have to throw, and go pick back up, thus requiring timed strikes.- A modification to the bombs (An upgrade or something I dont know)-A improvement to A.I strategy (I'll take a little bit more later)-A customization option to allow players to change the amount of hits needed to kill a knight before they die and respawn.-A option to change weapons available to the game (assuming it doesn't ruin gameplay  or balance)-A new powerup similar to the horse except a dragon where players ride it, and can shoot fireballs, the dragon could be slower, but require more hits to kill, and then the player on top of that.-Lances for horses that once a knight is riding a direction with a lance( which is longer than a sword) they will have a hard time turning quickly. Lances would not be natural and would have to be picked up.-A hot potatoe gamemode with bombs or explosives?-A cannon- enough said.Ok thats enough for a wishlist (sorry devs I know its frustrating getting ideas that are harder to script than to imagine.The A.I in this game is both amazing and terrible well sort of is (maybe I want to much) On expert the bots are very unforgiving they make very fast attacks and round about swings that can normally not be avoided. Especially on the dark knight challenge when all it takes is one bad shot and you'e cook. So basically when the game focused on just killing they always have an advantage. However during the other games such as Capture the flag, or last man standing, they can't really compete.  That brings me to my next thought of making the A.I target players that are winning in terms of point or ojective, and target players that have the best weapons, or some balance of the two. The human players have an advantage of knowing what the scores are and how to act accordingly in gameplay. The A.I does not meaning it continues to keep up its old tricks. If the computer had knowledge of score and how dangerous a player is it would make it hard to kill them, or possibly lead to the combined strategies of the A.I. Because lets be honest in last man standing you can just stand around waiting for the A.I to kill itself and you win by killing on other bot. Make it so it continues chasing the player before giving up so easily. Or make the A.I just better with weapons other than the basic sword because when it comes to weapon like the bow, or the bommarange they aren't very tactical.These are my thoughts on the game as it currently is I will continue to add to this if new ideas come to my head. Once again I understand talking, and programming are two very different things, but reading this is appricated thank you."

It can be played online and it is very fun that way, too, but it's just unstoppable with friends in the same room. There are a ridiculous number of game variances and each of them are totally excellent in their own way. This game can be hard to stop playing.Also definitely worth mentioning: I had an issue with my controller support (wound up being a virtual joystick program I didn't know I had installed). #ChainsawsomeGames was entirely, completely, 100% supportive in helping me troubleshoot my issue. One of the best customer support exchanges of my life (and I'm 38 in September).If you're looking for casual, hilarious PvP fun that could easily be taken as seriously as CS:GO or Starcraft if you really wanted, this game is absolutely worth your 15 USD. And that's even considering it's early access.I could go on and on.Are you old enough to remember having lots of fun playing against friends on Atari 2600? That old-school goodness is alive and well in Knight Squad. Four stars."
