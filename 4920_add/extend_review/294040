You should avoid this game.And for the developers, i assume you want to make money, since steam offers refunds to games played less than 2 hours."

It's by the second time you kill the dragon you realize what you bought. You stare at the screen as you power through for all achievements, running left and right through the same set of stages, one after another, until you're a literal mutated overlord that simply cannot be stopped, curb stomping the dragon and other monstrosities with your hammer sword into oblivion as you gauge the direction your life is headed in when you realize you sunk in three, maybe three and a half hours, you don't know cause Steam says nearly four but the phone rang a few times and your girlfriend shoved your cat in your face to awaken you from your salivating catatonic state of disbelief that you are sitting here just running right or maybe left and right to rack up some loot to turn yourself into a being perhaps stronger than god himself - nay, Odin himself! - who slays the abominations and mythical beasts all to save miners you IMMEDIATELY put to work in a slave labor strip mine to obtain more riches that, by the time you kill the dragon a second or third time, prove to be absolutely worthless, turning you into a sadistic sonofa♥♥♥♥♥ because you kept increasing your defense and speed ability to run around the screen like a five year child mid-sugar fuelled ADHD fit who refuses to let them go incase a future update requires that maximum of 99,999 currency despite there being no actual level cap beyond the final achievement of obtaining level 100 as you yourself rock back and forth to the rhythm of enemy destruction and jewel drops/acquisitions that will haunt your pathetic soul well past your own nightmares but rather deep into the grave!!!!!!!!!!!!!In short: Fun at first but 20 minutes in is boring. Not enough substance for continuous replays. Only for achievement hunters. Would not recommend outside that reason."
76561198122163777,Recommended,294040,21169571,"Posted: 12 February, 2016",all,Opal Knight,"Recommended for select gamers.This game is not for everyone, but if you like trying out experimental game concepts and ideas there is a gem here to be had.  If, however, you are looking for a fully fleshed out game with lots of immersion, choices, quests, story or depth then this game is probably one to pass by.Perhaps the king of casual gamers, there is some satisfaction in the mindless left, right, left action which results in the demise of hordes and hordes of baddies.  And . . . that's it, that's the whole game.  Move your mouse to the left of the screen your hero moves left, move it to the right and he moves right.  Stop on screen at a shop and you can tweek a few stats: attack, crit, armor and speed.  You play through ten levels each with a ""boss"" (more on that later) at the end, and after the tenth level is completed the difficulty slightly increases and you replay through all the same levels over again.  This continues on until you get bored and stop playing, or for many, until you reach level 100 and get the last Steam achievement.Why this works:  Mindless fun can be fun!  Plus you do get to plow through hordes and hordes of enemies in mere seconds.  And you can watch TV while you play and only glance back at the computer from time to time while grinding to that level 100.However, what doesn't really work is that there isn't any real game after that.  It really feels like a good first level for a much grander game, but it just stops there and then repeats itself.  Even with the ability to up skills I soon discovered that I really only had to up my armor skill to be able to beat any levels that momentarily detered me.  Also, bosses were pointless.  They aren't stronger than the other monsters in the level, at least not by enough of a margin to be noticable, so if you can sail through the level, the boss will be a one hit kill.  Plus there were a few balancing issues I came across; either I could sail through the level without a hitch including the boss, or I was beaten by the first three monsters I encounted.  There were no inbetween challenging levels.  I could either beat the level outright, or I repeatedly died and had to go out and replay the previous level until I had accrued enough gold to buy enough armor to sail through the next one.Then the main trouble I had while trying to level my hero up to 100 was that the levels never got any longer.  So, most levels are easy to beat in about 15 to 20 seconds, but you need to really grind the experience to level up your knight, meaning there were many times when I inadvertently finished a level instead of swinging back and forth to gain experience for my guy.  And finishing a level in only a matter of seconds means that the load times to go back to the main menu and then back into the levels seem much much longer than they actually are.  It would have been really helpful to lengthen the levels as they got ""harder"" then to just have them be exactly the same every time.I should mention that everytime you beat the 10th level boss you save a miner who then goes and mines gold for you, apparently even when you are not playing the game.  While this could have been a charming aspect of the game it actual was 100% pointless.  Most people will achieve 80% of the achievements in the first hour and then it becomes a grind fest for the last 2 leveling up achievements which really only take 2 or 3 more hours.  So, having a person mine gold while you don't have the game running isn't neccessary as you will probably play through the whole game in your first session.  Also, your gold maxes out at something like 999,999 or so which really only takes 40 to 60 seconds to accrue while playing in game, so the slow pecking away the miners do to get you 20,000 gold after 10 mins isn't even noticable, or needed.  Perhaps some other system of freeing different townsfolk to collect would have been a better end-of-level reward.All in all, I really did have fun playing this game, but its limitations means it really is for the experimental gamer.  If the previous description of the game did not deter you, then by all means I encourage you to purchase this game and try it out for yourself, because it really has a unique game design to it, but just know ahead of time that it isn't going to give you much more than that."

The achievement grind is real and that's all it's really good for.EDIT: Upon completion of all the achievements I've decided that this game is not worth the money. A bundle game at most. The amount of time it takes to grind for the final achievement will make you realise how tedious and repetitive the whole system is.

That's it.As for graphics, the character sprites and backgrounds are well done.The soundtrack is catchy, but ultimately repetitive.I'd really liked to have seen a few more levels to reduce the amount of repetition in the content, and each level's music could have been a little longer to reduce how often it loops."
76561198005400484,Not Recommended,294040,21825293,"Posted: 13 March, 2016",all,DoominaBottle,"Loot Hero DX is one of a pair of games released by VaragtP that were previously available on smart phone and tablet and have been upgraded for the PC market, now credit where credit is due these games while basic are better than their original counter parts but remain seated in the casual games category with minimum depth. Arguably this doesn't automatically make them poor games and Loot Hero DX certainly has wonderful sprite work and music but overall there is a sense of lost opportunity as its gameplay resembles a clicker game more than the casual action RPG it claims to be.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G-7_gB3YOQFor those who can't view the video the basic summary is this:You begin as a knight who moves very slowly and all the game play amounts to is walking left or right bumping into enemies until either you or enemies die. When enemies are defeated they drop gold which can be spent on upgrades to Attack, Defence, Critical hit Chance or Speed however only attack or defence are of any use, you also gain experience points which will eventually level your character which gives pitiful bonuses to these stats in comparison to the bought upgrades.The enemies do nothing to stop your progress other than act as a blockade and you can stand next to them without fear of been attacked or been pushed back, they also almost immediately respawn once you pass an area so you can grind back and forth through the same line without having to progress in the level.While there is minor story elements at the beginning the ending is little more that ""A winner is you"" before shunting you back to the menu and increasing the level of all the monsters and levels.You do gain a single miner each time who earns you gold while your not playing but because of the small gold cap you soon can earn the maximum amount of gold in seconds at the higher levels.As I say repeatedly during the review I love the artwork and this could of been made into a nifty little rogue light or platform RPG but if you need something to kill ten minutes Loot Hero DX is ideal but its not much use for anything else."

Run, kill, run some more, upgrade stats, kill the dragon.. do exactly the same thing at a higher diffculty, rince and repeat.. While this game worked ok as a mobile title, it feels rather pointless.

There's a lot of polish on what's here...but in the end, there just isn't enough here.Pros:Hard to describe, but it has a very satisfyingfeelwhen playing with a controller. The rumble, the sounds, it all clicks together. This feels very polished.I enjoyed the music, especially the Bamboo level.Straightforward, pick up and play, and feel like you're making progress constantlyCons:There are 9 levels that repeat over and over and over, in order.Once you figure out the strategy, there really aren't any more decisions to be made. Hold right, except for when you don't, then hold right some more.The load screen when going back the level select screen seems completely and infuriatingly fake, given that every level loads literally immediately when selected. It seems like small potatoes, until you upgrade your speed to the point that the actual ""gameplay"" for each level takes less time than the ""you did it!"" screen plus the load screen.Idle reward maxes out at 99999, and you can't leave the idle reward screen without claiming the reward. If you already have any money, then you effectively lose whatever you had when you claim the idle reward, which really helps defeat the entire point of the idle reward.I started out very optimistic, but ultimately the repetativeness and being forced to sit through the ""you did it"" and loading screens 75 times did me in.If this game looks interesting to you, I would encourage you to pick it up on a significant sale, with the warning that there isprobably one hour or less of gameplay, all of which isextremely repetative.Note: I've seen this game promoted as an idle / incremental game, which is why I bought it. I could understand it being labeled incremental, but the idle mechanic is weak and flawed and does not make any significant contribution to gameplay."

Then you beat the game and get to start from the beginning all over again. With the same enemies, music, backdrops, etc. The only thing that changes is the enemies' damage and health.Has fairly nice art style, although gets a bit tiring after a while seeing pixelly blurs zoom past your screen once you've upgraded your speed high enough.Runs quite smoothly. (I'm looking at you, Batman: Arkham Knight.)Not incredibly buggy.Cons:Incredibly short.Incredibly repetitive.No challengePrices of upgrades doesn't go above 9999 ""loot"" (currency of the game)You can't have any more than 99, 999 ""loot"" at any one time. The number simply doesn't go any higher.You can continue upgrading your critical hit chance past 100. Well, when I say upgrading, I really meaning pumping another 9, 999 ""loot"" into the button, only for nothing to change.When you're ramming through a bunch of enemies, the enemies you just killed may spawn directly behind you when you ram into the enemy in front of you. When this happens, you can slam into the enemy behind you, which deals damage to you which could kill you. This only happens when you are running from right to left.Not really much of a story to speak of. You're a hero. Go kill these things by charging at them.Essentially a ""one-button game"".Eventually, once you've beaten the dragon and gone through the difficulties several times, all you have to upgrade is your defense to continue progressing.Despite all of the cons, I do feel as if I enjoyed it for a short while. Yet I can't quite get rid of the feeling that even with a small discount and a fairly small asking price, this game still wasn't worth the $2.70 I paid for it. I also feel as though, with the amount of work that seems to be put into the large amount of sprites for the game (which seem to be quite well done), the game could have been quite a bit larger and better than how it felt. Although, keeping in mind that this is essentially a phone game, I would still like for them to have added more content for the PC version."

You can play it for free, or play this slightly updated version for a few bucks. Is it worth it? Let's see.PROS+ Decent graphics.+ Good music and sound.+ Cheap (as it should be).+ Trading cards.+ Difficulty is scaled reasonably well.+ Relatively amusing, and great for when you don't feel like putting any effort into a game.+ Miner system is nice.CONS- Too repetitive. A little design finesse could have helped a lot here - adding a bit more story, some randomness, etc.- The FPS rate drops pretty badly later in the game. It's also a bit slow loading in general.- You have to go to the main menu to exit the game.- Slightly glitchy; e.g., sometimes when you go to exit, you'll click, and ""Yes"", ""No"" will be left floating over the main menu, and it didn't really exit. It's also had issues where it didn't update the run speed properly. Also, muting the sound still allows this weird clicking noise to occur occasionally, just like normal; plus, the noise when you get knocked out remains present. Code is sometimes present at the end on screen when you beat the last boss.- You can't upgrade critical past 100%, but it will still take your money.- It would be nice if you could have it where it just goes from level-to-level instead of having to leave the level and selecting a new one. An infinite mode would also be a nice touch, where it just runs level-to-level in a seamless fashion - one big level that repeats over and over. It would make grinding for level 100 easier.- Your hero seems to get stuck sometimes; like he slams into the same enemy over and over, and you can't see him on the screen.- There shouldn't be a gold cap.- You should be able to mute sound without adjusting the levels.CONCLUSIONIt's cheap, decent, mindless fun, you get trading cards, and you're supporting an indie developer. It will give a few hours of fun over a period of time of your choosing, and seems like something that would be fun to come back to every now and then for some easy-as-heck victory. To me, that's worth it - and if you can get it on sale, even more so.Thanks for reading my review; I hope it was helpful. Have a great day, and Godspeed!"

You merely hold right and your tiny knight dashes at incredible speeds into the enemy army. Monsters explode like obedient loot pinatas and then you spend some gold giving your knight incremental upgrades (hint: defense beats all).That's the complete summation of the game. The problem is that the developer(s) obviously put a lot of effort into the visuals and the engine. It's incredibly smooth despite the crazy speeds our metal covered hero sprints around at and the sprite work makes has a consistent and very pleasing look. Even the backgrounds have some serious polish.I'm recommending this game only for those who like ""clicker"" games and to support and encourage the developer to do more with this games art assets. Please spin this into maybe a side-scrolling RPG or something."

But the graphics, music and overall feeling of power had me excited to come back to it again on PC.This is indeed the difinitive version of the game.  The iPad version had less levels and features (At least when I played it last.) and eventually with a fully powered up character it also suffered some bad framerate issues.  However, there is none of that in this STEAM version and it runs perfectly well and smooth.What you see in the trailer is literally what you get.  You traverse maps unendingly slaying monsters and endlessly leveling up.  That feeling alone is intense and satisfying and of course watching the stats going up and the feeling of forever getting stronger is quite fun.Yes the game is very basic.  It is esentially one large leveling treadmill, but, depending on who you are, you might really enjoy it.  I can tell you for sure that 100%-ing it will take you around 2.5 hours and after that the game does indeed go on for all intents and purposes -- infinitely.  So you can revisit it again and again and eventually you will become so strong that you cannot even see what is happening on the screen any longer.  Your little dude is basically his own Intercontinental Ballistic Missile at that point, and it is hilarious to watch.So if you like leveling up for leveling up's sake, buy it.  If not, don't.  Simple math really.It definitely is a shame that people are reviewing this mini-gem negatively and talking about refunds, because really, it's just a great little game that will take you no more than 2.5 hours to finish and that you may come back to and play again one day.  IT'S 2 DOLLARS PEOPLE!  Many shames-on-you if you're even THINKING about refunding it.  We are essentially talking about a bottle of pop here.  And really you're cheating the poor developer because their game costs next to nothing and can be beaten within the time limit that STEAM still allows for refunds.  Which is a pretty disturbing loophole as far as this game is concerned and if you end up abusing it -- that's pretty sick and rather low in perfect honesty.Oh well.  I'll be KEEPING my copy because I actually LOVE THIS GAME!"

I really enjoyed this game. The game plays as a side scroller where the player only controlls the hero by way of the mouse to go from one side to the other, hit enemies and then makes upgrades to advance to bosses and better areas. I enjoyed the game because it's straightforward mechanics and progression really got me hooked in the first part of the game. However, the game does become repetitive later, with the same areas being used having the same exact monsters but with bigger levels and rewards. If you are looking for a few hours of active fun or want something to play in between work, this game is good, especially for the price, however, if you play very actively do not expect it to keep you hooked for a long time as after finishing it and getting all the achievements it just becomes an infinite level and repetition of the steps done before."
