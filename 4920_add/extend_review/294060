Gameplay wise it's probably not the best 2d platformer on steam, but it's teleport gimmicks make it quite unique. The game's intended to be challenging but at some points it's stops being challenging and simply becomes tedious, the boss fights being the main culprits.Nevertheless I felt I got my moneys worth out of it for 15$, and I will probably try and improve my times at some point."

It's not that they're not responsive, it's just the way the character functions in the world.Like other negative reviews have stated, it's too punishing because of the controls - which makes this game very unwelcomimg to players who are new to platforming games. For hardcore veterens like myself, this game is a pain. It's not a good pain like what you experience in Super Meat Boy, Spelunky or even Rayman Legends (towards the end).The game does a good job of explaining the controls and powers as they are introduced and the storytelling is nice but still the game manages to feel empty and fails to capture what other loved platforming games have.Sad that such a cool looking game with such a colorful style just fell short. Still glad I tried it out though."

The cel-shaded environments combined with the beautifully painted backgrounds make this a truly gorgeous game.  However, it takes more then really good art to make a really good game.  Thats not to say this is a bad game but it certainly carries with it some baggage that weighs down the overall experience.  This test of reflexes and patience may not be for everyone.The story of Aaru's Awaking is a tale of four gods.  The gods decided long ago to split the day into four equal parts Dawn, Day, Dust, and Night.  You play as Aaru.  A buff looking creature that lies to serve Dawn.  You're warned by you're master of an evil presence invading Night and must traveling through all four kingdoms to face this threat.  As Aaru travels through the realms the other gods sow seeds of doubt into his mind and he begins to question if he is on the right path.  This makes for a pretty interesting story which is narrated though story book cut-scenes between each realm.After seeing someone play it on Youtube, Aaru's Awaking quickly caught my attention.  I proceeded to download a demo and was instantly impressed.  Not only was the game fun to look at but the mechanics were very clever.  Aaru was fairly maneuverable but the key mechanic of the game is teleportation.  This is accomplished by pressing the left mouse button to project out a ball of light then press the right mouse button to appear at the balls current location.  This makes for some unique platforming especially when combined with Aaru's dash ability.For a simple concept the developers certainly push it to its absolute limits.  The later levels become extremely technical requiring immense speed and precision.  Although the first couple stages help get the player into a rhythm it still seems like the difficulty ramps up a bit too quickly.  I don't mind a challenge but I definitely didn't realize what I was getting into.  Towards the end of the Night chapter, especially the boss stage, it became so hard I just wanted to pull my hair out.  This was the point where I stopped having fun and I decided to stop playing soon after.  (About 90% through the game)I'm glad I tried this game.  It had a really unique mechanic at its core and some pretty clever level design.  My favorite part is still the wonderful art and original soundtrack.  That being said, I was so focused on trying to stay alive I didn't get to enjoy the music that much.  (Not to mention in the end I got so sick of hearing Aaru die I took off my headset.)  Whether or not you'll like this game really comes to down to how much you like a challenge.  I don't quiet have the reflexes to really enjoy this game to the end but I'm sure there are gamers out there who do."

It really is the first game that comes to my mind when I get to recommend one.The gameplay is original. I don't agree with people blaming sloppy controls, it worked out pretty fine for me. It's definitely designed for keyboard and mouse, though.But the real strength of this game is on the art side. Stunning hand-drawn graphics, simple yet beautiful story and awesome soundtrack make a really charming game. I'd say it's like having a dream.This was a unique experience that was worth every penny."

It might work better with mouse and keyboard, but I have a strong preference for a joypad. Not recommended for controller users, but if you can look past that, it may be a good game."

Teleportation mechanics open so many possibilities and the game does a great job implementing sections of a level to seem like mini puzzles as one tries to clear each level as quickly as possible. There's a sense of liberty which i enjoyed about this game as a lot of these sections within a level can be tackled differently and can required some out-of-the-box thinking. The game is by no means slow and will sometimes require precise timing and aim tho with each checkpoint u can breath easy. While some sections can be tricky requiring some serious skill fortunately there are infinite oppurtunities to retry but that does not make Aauru's awakening by no means a walk in the park, unless that park contained booby traps killer monsters and ninjas (cus ninjas make everything better, sadly this game had no ninjas lol, and it still rocked). If a challenge is what you want seek then a challenge is what you'll get. The teleportation is what set aside this platformer aside from many others to me and its just so much fun to mess with. I should mention the game is basically story driven but can be replayable i just wish there where some form of collectibles hidden items of sorts or stuff as i enjoyed getting 100% and stuff it would increase the replayability of the game to me, tho ik there are those people who hate those types of things so it could just be optional items to maybe like idk have notes like a lore to previous events of the war or monster encyclopedia pages. Still my respects to the creators of this game they have my support and i wish to see possibly a sequel or presequel witch i would buy. Hope this review helped."

A bit hard with the mouse and keyboard, a controller is better suited for this game. Just wish it wasn't as fast so the player can take in the art work and admire it. Get this if you like a challenge and want to play something while you wait for steam updates."

Gameplay is fair and consistant, which enables the speedrun-elements of the game.. A built-in timer, with Global/Friends -leaderboards.Gameplay:The game consists of Levels, within Chapters.. And a story in the passenger seat. Which is fine by me, as the story is potentially intriguing, but its depth is mere mediocre. Still, the progression comes organically, with the steady rise in gameplay difficulty, and players' skill requirement.The first chapter is more about getting a handle on things, and the few skills acquired by Aaru. The latter chapters are where those skill are needed to have been sufficiently adapted by the player, and in turn, applied with skill.Atmosphere:-Visual; Eventhough the game is set more in the 'fantasy realm'.. i find the game does have a tint of this 'sci-fi`esque' -cartoon style, which first reminds me of the year 81-cult classic 'Heavy Metal'-Sound; Much like the story, the music takes a back seat.. Still, it does its thing of setting the atmosphere well. No problems with 'SFX' either.=FOR WHOM IS THIS GAME FOR, is actually more important question, than 'How good is it?' (If that seems like a dumb as *Tral'la-fakin'-laa* statement, then let me clarify; The game is good.. really good, I mean..»Caveat coming»)»for those who enjoy a 'Fast, High Precision Platformer, with WASD+Mouse-movement'To sum up:-Gameplay/movement: | A-Story:                            | C+-Atmosphere:		       | B+"

I finished the first 5 levels so far.This game is challenging and will keep you on your toes for most of the level, but the checkpoints have made it tollerable, while still being rewarding."
,Recommended,294060,19607784,"Posted: 10 December, 2015",all,Nab,Playing on linux with x360 pad.Fun Jump&Run with unique visual style.The controls are a bit different from other J&R titles but very well suited to the game. Some reviewers complained about the game not controlling like every other game. Aparently the inabilty to adapt to change goes hand in hand with the inabilty to use the simple configuration tool that comes with the game.The voice acting is amateurish and sounds a bit rushed like it was done by their favorite niece. Yet it fits the theme of the game nicely.Each level comes with a time challenge. The times are pretty challenging to me but I enjoy that.
,Not Recommended,294060,20545582,"Posted: 15 January, 2016",all,NoNameBohr,"Recommendation:Worth 2$ it if you're looking for really looking for a decent new platformer. It's not great and not worth 15$.Description:Aaru's Awakening is a fun 2D medium-difficulty platformer, that comes with some issues.You can dash and teleport. To teleport you first fire a ball at your mouse pointer and then with a right-click you teleport to the ball. Your only attack is to teleport into enemies which instantly kills them.There's 16 normal levels where you run from point A to point B where you mostly avoid being killed. Plus 4 bosses. All levels are timed and they translate to a gold/silver/bronze medal.The good:Great art.Interesting story that never interfered with the playing.Really fun teleportation mechanics.The so-so:The level design could be more creative.The voice acting is ok.The bad:The screen is too small to see everything you need to.When you die you respawn near your last save-point. Each savepoint is just a little star which you have to pass through. The issue is, sometimes you respawn after the save-point and effectively skip part of the challenge. This feels really unsatisfying.Running feels slow and heavy. In the air that's fine, on the floor it should be quicker to move and turn.The art made it hard to distinguish platforms, hazards and background a few times.It doesn't make me want to go back and improve my time."

,Not Recommended,294060,18004072,"Posted: 12 September, 2015",all,yuru,"Trys to be a hardcore 2D platformer but fails to convinve because the screen is way to small to give the player enough time to react to all those hazards. The artstyle is unique and ok, but it also makes spotting certain obstacles really difficult, like lava or tar pits are drawn in the same colors like the surroundings, so you take it for solid ground. The unnecessary dying commences and drains you of joy real fast."

Got about 5 seconds in and it tells me press LT to jump.  LT does nothing.  No buttons on the controller jump.  Playing under linux with an xbox 360 controller.   Controller works fine in everything I've played with it.  This game is broken.  Don't buy it."
