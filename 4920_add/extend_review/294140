,Recommended,294140,12604068,"Posted: 23 October, 2014",all,Timberwolf1959,"Is It Worth a Buy?Allow me to explain why I'm going to say yes and no. If you were to spend a dollar for every hour of entertainment, this game gives you exactly two hours, even with unlocking all the achievements (Meaning if that's how things worked, this game would be a fair price).  Does that make this game bad, No, of course not. This is one of those games where it's one and done and you are satisfied, for the most part. Yet you feel empty, you go back and do all the extras, somewhat more satisfied than you were before. However, this game has atmosphere, it's not horrifying. No, it's creepier, and it really captures how helpless you are as being the frog you are. The only logical thing you would do is swim to survive.Pay Full Price?Again allow me to explain why I'm going to say yes and no. If you do all the little extras I would say yes. If you are just going to play through it once, it's questionable. The questionable thing to do is to buy it full price because this is one of those games that are, short and sweet. It really depends on you, the buyer. Most people don't like paying $1.99 for 20-40 minute experience, but some do. If this game is 99 cents or below, it's a definite buy. Again, it still is dependable on you the buyer.Sharing With OthersJust like many other creepy horror games you want to share this game with your friends. Does this still apply for ""They Breathe""? Yes, of course it does! Something so innocent such as a body of water seems too cute. Is it predictable what you find below the body of water, somewhat. However, it still has the creepy atmosphere that you are surviving as this frog in some sort of nightmare.Game FeelOne of the negative reviews here complain about the controls are clunky. However, I played with the keyboard just fine and was able to achieve a perfect game. However, everyone is not me. Remember you are frog underwater, the movement is slowed and almost like a light coating of ice. It feels to some extent realistic, but again I had no problem with the controls. *RAGE QUIT SPOILER* You will feel desperate and agitated when you attempt to save all the frogs, it's simply due to the fact that you have that icy movement and keyboards do not have perfect diagonal movement. I have not tried with a joystick of some sort. Despite the keyboard having not perfect diagonal movement, it's manageable.Overall RecommendationI would say yes to the full price, if you are going for a perfect game, sharing with others, or if you are going to play through it once, it is still satisfying. However, you might feel empty because of the amount you paid. If you do not want to pay a $1.99 simply wait for a sale. If you can't wait for a sale then buy at your own risk, but you most likely won't be disappointed. I myself enjoyed this game; it had a nice atmosphere and makes its debut short and sweet. If I had to give it a formal score, I would give it an 8/10.NotesI want to apologize that this review is not formatted. Yes, there is a ""Formatting Help"" button below the review box. Tried several times had trouble. If someone could help with the formatting I will take the time to format. *UPDATE* Formatting and revision will be done EVENTUALLY. My priorities aren't steam reviews right now. However, I do hope to find the time to get revision and formatting done. I would also like to apolgoize for it not being done yet."

What does heroism have to do with a froggy horror game?Heroes are not always the biggest, the strongest, the smartest, the fastest, the most popular, or the cutest. A hero can be none of these.In fact, a hero can be completely, utterly, helpless.Powerful weapons, shiny armor, fancy spells, even legends of exploits... these mean nothing to a frog, and to your knowledge, you are not the poisonous kind of amphibian.You begin this journey out of mere curiosity. You continue out of survival.As I played They Breathe, I honestly felt building wonder and terror as horror itself rose to meet me. Every wave was electrifying. I admit, I sweated. Some might say profusely. By the end, at the climax... fire ran through my body, threatening to paralyze me.But do you even ""win the day""? What does that even mean to a frog?They Breathe is a purist distillation of what many other games hide, and lose, behind an advertised front of graphics, features, and voicework of all sorts. Here, you will not find much in ""game content"", reflected by the small download size and very small price.But you will find a soulful, wordless look at the very heart of a hero, represented with the simplicity of a frog and the honesty of nature itself.If you seek timelessness in your collection, They Breathe is a pearl of great price, sold for *scoffs in amazement* a 2 dollar bill."
,Recommended,294140,10661907,"Posted: 22 June, 2014",all,kekmet,"Travel down into the depths of a flooded forest with your frog protagonist, competing with the forest's other inhabitants for the world's most precious resource. The game says this is oxygen- little bubbles of life floating up from the depths- but I think it may be something else entirely.What is that? Well, this is one of those games where knowing too much about the plot going in may very well make it not worth playing. They Breathe tells its story in twenty to thirty minutes, provides you with no quest markers. No on-screen hud, no explanations, no sonorous narrator lamenting your plight. It trusts you, the player, to find the story, at your own pace. For once this works, because the simple gameplay and single path leaves little room to get lost or distracted.Despite its short length, They Breathe nevertheless takes its time on its storyline, and obvious care was put into the crafting of this game. Gameplay is simple- you swim around collecting oxygen bubbles, facing one wave after another as you head deeper and deeper. You have access to a dash move and little else. The game doesn't tell you how to take down the predators you face in the forest, but your little frog is tough enough that you have some time to figure it out, and will respawn if you don't quite get it in time.The graphics are again simple but lovely, colorful enough to catch your eye but still looking like something that has been submerged deep underwater, so not especially bright. The flooded forest doesn't look like a place you would want to spend an afternoon, but it looks the part. The actors onstage are simply but boldly drawn. The design of the land's predators is especially good. The music, meanwhile, is pure background music, but quite relaxing- it seems like the sort of thing you might leave running in the background when you're doing something else. In fact, I've been leaving the game running in the background while I've been writing the review for just that reason.The game adds some replay value to its short length and simple gameplay with its achievements. Some of the achievements actually offer different ways to try and play the game, or give different ideas on how to take on enemies, none of them are especially grindy though some are difficult (or I am just horrible at games, which is also always true).So, for the low price tag, I would recommend diving into this one. It may very well leave you breathless."

I liked it so little that I left it a solid, like, year before I got around to polishing off the last few challenges.But They Breathe isn't for me. It does something, something that even I can appreciate, and it does a fine job of it.In They Breathe, you suffer through 8 waves of enemies, which you deal with either by avoiding the enemies until they run out of oxygen, or pushing them into the oxygen bubbles until they explode. After that, you deal with a boss and the game ends. Each wave is advanced automatically, there's no exploration or ancilliary elements.Every couple of waves, not all of them, you can try to save some friendly NPCs by pushing them into the randomly generated bubbles.""We wish you the best of luck""- The Working PartsIt's a very, very short game, maybe 20 minutes, and depending whether or not the RNG favours you another 5-10 playthroughs to try and get all the challenges - finish the game without using the quick boost, save all the friendly NPCs, that sort of thing.The main reason I don't like They Breathe is that it's not fun. Not in the slightest. Your character, Glenn, controls reasonably, but so much of the game is rockem sockem bumper cars, dealing with bad enemy pathfinding, randomized precious oxygen placement, with the quagmire of enemy health regenerating through ""head"" switching, or friendly NPCs being stuck in a loop of despair.This isn't fun. Honestly, I hate it. I hate the gameplay. If I knew what I was getting into I wouldn't have bothered.Gameplay isn't the point, though. The point of They Breathe is to tell a story through enemy design, environment and gameplay, without a single line of text or dialogue (Or ""pictograms"" the likes of which Hyper Light Drifter employs, which is cheating and missing the point). It does that incredibly well and uses each square inch of gameplay, design and character sprites to tell that story to its fullest.It does it so well that despite being a game that I didn't like I'm going to recommend it anyway, because They Breathe is something special that deserves to be played.Maybe give it a go."

Don't be fooled by the cute picture. This game is morbid and I found it scary at times. Worth the $2.00 although it is about only 30 minutes long. Well 30 minutes of being a cute little frog.
,Recommended,294140,16778639,"Posted: 29 June, 2015",all,Fire525,"From a young age, I've always had an irrational fear of polyps and coral. Something about their constantly pulsating fronds, that weird blend of plant and animal, just resonated with me on some primal level. I'd always thought if one touched me, I'd actually cry, so deep was my fear.They Breathe brings that fear of unknown sea plants to life in a very real, horrifying way. There's something about the simplistic art style, the subtle sound effects and the way things drift past underwater which invokes the sense of something darker lurking, of an unknown purpose behind the weird creatures I observed as I played. It's an eerie, unsettling atmosphere, where it feels as if anything could jump at you, where creatures twist and mutate.Everything about They Breathe seems masterfully crafted to heighten those twin feelings of despair and mystery.Despair, in the superb animations of frogs flailing about, gasping for air, or struggling as tentacles slowly wrap around them.Unknown, in the gradual descent, uncovering new aspects of the ecosystem while the sounds of more horrors to come drift upwards from below.While the chilling reality behind the ecosystem of They Breathe became apparent to me rapidly, the game still stands out to me regardless. Despite being built around a simple twist, its mechanics and art mean that it can stand more than adequately on its own legs, condensing into 30 minutes what so many depictions of horror fail at in hours of screen time.This is a game which not only confirms my childhood fears of polyps, but adds to them. This is a game which can inspire fear with a glimpse of swaying fronds off screen. And it's 2 dollars."
,Recommended,294140,10565536,"Posted: 20 June, 2014",all,ownosourus,"Intriguing and well-executed idea of a game. Controls are very easy to grasp and leaves the player to figure out each section by themselves, like a puzzle almost, but with more deadly jellyfish than most puzzlers. The end ""twist"" has to do with a certain optical illusion, maybe you'll spot it before then, maybe not, but all I can say is that it's actually pretty ingenious and a touch morbid, especially if you find out seeing the scenery lying at the very bottom. Atmosphere is topnotch as are sound effects. As you descend further and further it becomes just that much more unsettling. I wouldn't call it a particularly difficult game, though there are a couple of sections that I died a fair number of times. While I believe a game should only be as long as needed, this game is really, really short. Most people should have no problems finishing this game in a casual sitdown in under half an hour, and that's including the times you'll die and restart sections. I know that a game like this would get very repetitive if it was very long, but for a game that you have to pay for there should be just a bit more content. As well-executed as it is, it's still a very basic, ultra-linear title with every section basically variations of outwitting the same few enemies and going down further into the abyss. It's a great concept and a fun enough game that's crying out to be expanded on."

After all, who makes a mystery – horror game about frogs and lives to tell the tale ?I have heard a lot of good things about this title. For instance that it started as a two-people school project – and in my opinion that is an important fact, since if a game like this was able to make it through the Greenlight, there must be something going on for it.That ‘main’ feature is the game’s dark and creepy atmosphere. It needs to be said that ‘They Breathe’ is incredible at building the tension. The gameplay mechanics, sound and graphics may be simple, but still they do a perfect job of creating a completely unsettling experience. Furthermore, I believe that ‘They Breathe’ looks much better ingame than it does on the screenshots.Still it needs to be said that this game can be completed in below 30 minutes.  And this information is important for more reasons than the sheer gameplay length. First of all: the major component of every good horror story is the mystery. While ‘They Breathe’ deliver a strong (although a bit disappointing) reveal, after said 30 minutes there is nothing more to keep one playing with the exception of these few achievements that can be unlocked. Furthermore, it can be argued that such a short experience isn’t enough to build as much tension as it was in the case of games like Penumbra or (the early instalments of) Silent Hill which kept the player at the edge of the seat for many long and horrifying hours.To summarize: While I don’t necessarily believe that charging 2 euros for 30 minutes of gameplay is an entirely fair practice and there are plenty of creepy freeware games out there (say, suteF, SCP Containment Breach, Yume Nikki and many, many more…) I would still recommend buying ‘They Breathe’ as an investment in a promising indie developer. And then, maybe one day we will be able to play a longer and more complex game titled, for example, ‘They Don’t Breathe Any More’.***‘They Breathe’ to interesująca mała gierka. Bo niby jakie inne studio dotąd zrobiło grę – horror o żabach i żyło na tyle długo żeby o tym opowiadać ?Zanim zagrałem, słyszałem o tej grze dużo dobrego. Na przykład że powstała jako szkolny projekt dwóch ludzi co w mojej opinii jest dobrą informacją:  jeżeli tego typu gra jest w stanie przebić się przez Steamowego Greenlight’a, musi mieć w sobie ‘to coś’.Główną ‘atrakcją’ gry jest bez wątpienia jej ciężka atmosfera. Trzeba przyznać że ‘They Breathe’ potrafi budować napięcie lepiej niż niejedna gra z segmentu AAA. Mechanika gry, dźwięk i grafika, mimo iż minimalistyczne, świetnie spisują się w budowaniu niepokojącego doświadczenia. Co więcej, gra wygląda dużo lepiej ‘w akcji’ niż na zrzutach ekranu.Mimo dobrego wrażenia jakie gra sprawia trzeba powiedzieć jedno: ‘They Breathe’ można ukończyć w czasie krótszym niż 30 minut. To ważna informacja nie tylko ze względu na krótki czas ‘zabawy’ jaki gra oferuje. Po pierwsze: to co napędza każdy horror to tajemnica. Zakończenie ‘They Breathe’ jest mocne (może tylko odrobinkę zawodzi) – tyle że po 30 minutach nie ma już nic co trzymało by gracza przed ekranem. Może poza tymi kilkoma achivementami które pozostały do zdobycia. Co więcej, 30 minut to zbyt mało aby zbudować atmosferę – w porównaniu taka Penumbra czy (wczesne części) Silent Hill przerażały przez długie godziny.Sumując: Mimo że 2 euro za 30 minut gry może nie wydawać się do końca uczciwą ceną, a w Internecie pełno jest darmowych horrorów (patrz: suteF, SCP Containment Breach, Yume Nikki i wiele innych…), rekomenduję  ‘They Breathe’ jako inwestycję w dobrze zapowiadającego się niezależnego developera. Może kiedyś pozwolą nam zagrać w coś dłuższego i lepiej dopracowanego? Na przykład ‘They Don’t Breathe Any More’ ?"

,Recommended,294140,34387786,Posted: 20 August,all,BunnyLizard,"TLDR; Kudos to the devs for this great little gem of a game.My beginnings with this game are around the time it was released in 2014, when I became hardcore into 'hoarding' games on Steam to create the eventual backlog pile-up I have today. It looked interesting enough, but when I saw it tagged as ""Horror"", I chalked it up to users just trolling. Right? See, it looked like a simple adventure game about a frog. So perhaps I forgot to wishlist it, but either way, the game faded from my priorities list.This brings us to present day: I happened to see the game in my queue and had a flashback of realization. Since I've been on an adventure/platformer kick, and had the 2$ to spare, I bought it right then.The game is great, honestly, and I'm mad at myself for never playing it until now. Gameplay is tight and fluid (haha, water pun...) as well as leaving you to puzzle things out alone. The title screen music hooked me when I booted up the game for the first time - it reminded me of the hauntingly beautiful music ofDear Esther, another masterpiece of a game. The hand-drawn art style is both charming, and later on, disturbing, to perfectly capture the alien feel of a flooded forest.Perhaps I've seen too much in playing many dak and psychological horror games, but the game didn't feel like a horror-adventure, but did leave one feeling a bit uneasy by the final depths of the underwater forest. Personally, I feel the tag ""Surreal"" does more to describe the feel of the game; and if that's a genre of game you enjoy, pick this game up.It's also short, so it won't cut too much into working through your own Steam backlog (seriously..send help), plus a few challenging achievements will give you more time to be immersed in the unique world The Working Parts have created here.The less you know going into it, the better.

As I was playing I was constantly questioning what these enemies were, I thought jellyfish, moose, cow? I settled down and the game became scaled in difficulty not to the exent of you can't pass the wave but it made you think what you had to do in order to pass. The scenery was drawn up magnificent, it was nothing I've seen before and made me question what it was. They Breathe is is incredibly short, my playthrough was about 20 minutes, and I expected it to be short. It's a 2$ game and on sale for 59 cents so I wasn't disapointed and knew what would come. But for such a cheap price the story was insane and a mindblower. After meeting the boss I put 2 and 2 together and realized the boss was in fact an alien-looking egg sac holding captive frogs and using them for their air! The 'moose' enemies were actually frogs upside down! It made me sit in my chair and realize how broad it was, literally under my nose and I hadn't seen it. This game was well done and no complaints from me, I can whole heartedly say this game in my own opinion was a solid 10/10."

The game paints a macabre view of an ecosystem gone awry, and you are tasked (as a frog) to discover its secret. It is a short game, but the atmosphere leaves a lasting impression on the player. From its saccharine looking main screen you may be deceived into thinking that this isn't a horror game, but that soon changes as you delve deep into the pond you are forced to explore. When you realize the true reality of the protagonist's new environment and the enemies you encounter, you are left with a deep seated uneasiness.

That revelation, to me, was horrific. Mind you, it wasn't scary, but it was indeed disturbingly horrific.A+ on the story-telling. As you play, if you take notice of the enemies and the background, you start to unravel some clues as to why, what & how. Just a fair warning though, this game is extremely short but for a 61cent trip, it was well worth it.I love the ambience and the art style very much. It speaks, well... horrors! The game-play is actually a puzzle type where you have to figure out the best way to defeat the enemies (Megaman bosses, anyone?). Nobody tells you what to do and that makes it even better.I would have liked it even more if it was longer or if there was some kind of new game + or difficulty upgrade somehow.

What appears innocent at first glance quickly evolves into a brutal and unsettling game of survival as you control a frog trying to make its way to the bottom of a drowned forest.  The game is simple, and your only immediate goal is to catch air bubbles as you descend so you won't drown.  What becomes apparent however the further you go down, is that there are other frogs besides yourself fighting for air, as well as a twisted horde of parasitic creatures that prey on them.Initially, you may want to help your fellow frogs catch air so they can ascend to the surface, but the parasites become more numerous the further down you go, so saving all of your friends becomes a tall order if you want to survive yourself.  It might even be easier to nudge some frogs into a parasite to save your own skin; watching in horror as they feed on and merge with your fellow frogs, taking on a sickening new form.  Whatever awaits at the bottom is your ultimate goal though, and making it there is what drives this journey, even if it costs a piece of your soul."

Keep playing to find out.Start up the game and you are greeted with a screen to adjust your brightness settings.  Pretty standard.  On the keyboard you can use the arrows to move the slider left or right, or use A and D to move it.The next screen shows your frog sitting on a log.  A log floating in a large blue body of water.  Not much else.Press a key to start the game.  Your frog dives into the water.  The game gives you ""one last hint"" to use the spacebar for a powerstroke, sort of like the sprint button when running in an fps.  To swim you use WASD or arrow keys to swim in a given direction.Your other controls are: ESC - pauses game and brings up a menu.  Q - quit the game.  R - restart the current wave.You will encounter some other frogs floating up.  They're in danger of drowning.  How do you know?  Their facial expressions and their color.  The life indicator in this game is the color of your frog and the color of the exhaled bubbles.  Green means your frog is healthy, brown means your frog is dying.  Normal exhahled bubbles are squiggly and white.  If you're dying your exhaled bubbles are streaks of red blood.  To replenish health, swim into the round white/blue bubbles that come floating up from the bottom of the screen.  If you take too much damage you will lose the ability to sprint until you get more health.  If you take more damage you die.  The game will automatically restart you from the last checkpont.Back to those two frogs you just met.  They're brown, so bump into them to push them into the floating white/blue bubbles to give them some air.  Give them enough and they will recover and swim away to the surface.  That is how you rescue frogs.  If you neglect them too long they will drown.Eventually you will meet some enemies.  The basic descriptions are: cows and jellies.  Cows can ram you to do damage.  If they get an air bubble they will supercharge and move faster as they try to ram you.  Prevent them from collecting air bubbles and eventually they will drown.The jellies on the other hand are damaged by the air bubbles.  Lure them into a few bubbles and they will explode.  They will grab onto you if they touch you.Another note, green bubbles are bad.  They damage you.Keep defeating enemies and helping your fellow frogs, keep diving deeper.

Tem uma temática que deveria tocar a todos muito bem. Ele retrata a nossa maior necessidade e nos impõe a pensar o quanto a despresamos: O oxigênio. Com o decorrer do jogo, além de tentar salvar os outros sapos atraindo-os e empurrando-os para as bolhas, você também tem que buscar sua sobrevivência. E mesmo assim tem aquelas criaturas que abusam: Tentam roubar o oxigênio a partir dos sapos para garantir o seu, já que as bolhas não lhes bastam. É literalmente uma ""luta"" pela sobrevivência, causada esta, principalmente pelo nosso descaso em cuidar da natureza e de nossos recursos naturais, ameaçando nossas próprias vidas e inclusive a daqueles, como no caso, das criaturas deste jogo - porque não soubemos cuidar do que é deles também, sendo isto bem incluído no final.

But then, some of your other frog buddies are having a hard time breathing and also need those bubbles...but so do you. So what do you do? Do you share the bubbles, risking your own little frog life or do you take it all for yourself so you can explore further into the depths.Other than slowing drowning frogs, the depths also presents its own dangers in the form of unexplainable creatures of the deep. It is up to you to not drown and find out the source of these monsters and in turn, prevent the rest of your frog buddies from falling victim to the deep.They Breathe is a vertical sidescroller (Avoid-em up) where drowning is a major element of gameplay in that you are trying to not drown and at the same time attempting to prevent baddies from getting oxygen. You also have the moral choice to assist your frog buddies but that task becomes increasingly more difficult as you go deeper and deeper. For $2 the game is certainly worth it, especially if you go for the challenging but fun achievements (Only 8). On sale, the game enters the sub dollar range and I can recommend you pick it up during these times!If the game seems much more morbid than it at first appears that's because it is. This is an extremely dark game and the artistic direction is done very well. You even are rewarded with an interactive behind the scenes once you finish the game for the first time. It is understandable to want to take all of the oxygen for yourself but just remember...all of the creatures down there with you....They Breathe as well."

You're left to work out the rest of the controls for yourself and initially figuring out what to do may take a bit of fumbling around.But as you slowly learn how to move to the next level, you also learn more about the eerie ecosystem of the environment. Both through trail and error, and through watching the experiences of other hapless frogs, you discover the  harrowing evolution of the enemies you face and get to see the cruel truth of the dark depths.You are left with a few unanswered questions of your own about the situation so if you like your deep and meaningfuls handed to you on a platter, this might not be the game for you.

There are some creepy elements that gradually unfold to reveal what’s really happening the deeper you dive.  But honestly, it is more of a game that makes you think.Unfortunately for me, the “twist” in the game did not come as a surprise as I saw it almost immediately very early on.  However this did not prevent me from enjoying the game in the least bit.  The beauty of ‘They Breathe’ is in the presentation.  The game does not force any kind of a story on you but instead leads you on a journey to discover it for yourself.  There is the obvious discovery at the bottom of the sea, but it still leaves many unanswered questions that are up to each player to interpret for themselves.The art style is simple and reminiscent of some illustrations you might find in a children’s storybook.  With the content being rather dark, it is both ironic and brilliant.  The soundtrack (consisting mostly of ambient sounds) is effective and the gameplay/controls are top-notch.I purchased this game for $0.61 on sale.  And although you can beat this game in under 30 minutes, there is some replay value (especially for achievement hunters).  This is a nice little indie title that is well-designed and fun to play.  I would recommend this game for the short, simple experience that it is."

The art and ambiance blend perfectly together to create a very eerie mood in a game that starts off with a little froggy swimming around. But in mere moments you will come across underwater horrors and other frogs that dessperately need your help. Discovering what happens to these frogs that are caught by the horrors is terrifying. And with no music playing and only the creaks and moans of life under the surface drawing you in deeper, this game's beautifuly realised and haunting world is one that makes you wanting to play more.The mechanics are fairly simple and the frog you control moves fluidly and organicly. Our froggy hero can't breathe underwater, but you frequently get small air bubbles rising from bellow to replenish your health/air as indicated by the shade of green your frog is. You can use the arrow keys to move and the space bar to go faster, which is handy when needing to grab a bubble. But once the underwater creatures arrive you will need to figure out each of thier weaknessess to dispose of them. And once you get to the final encounter you must incorporate everything you learned to survive.They Breathe is a fantastic game. I love our froggy hero and his little friends you can save. The art portrays a lush, yet increasingly alien world, the controls are solid, the challenge of the game is just right, and when you finish the game, it will leave you wanting to play even more. It is hard to explain how in just a short time that They Breathe left me with a sense of wonderment and appreciation for a finely crafted experience such as this, but that's exactly what it did and it makes me even feel things that I can't even put into words because I can't properly express or comprehend them myself (as weird as that may seem). For $ 1.99 this game is a steal at this price; if they charged $5 I would still easily recommend this game. Play They Breate, you won't regret it, seriously."

I do not recommend the game.I can imagine if you were in the right mood to be creeped out this would make an exellent purchase, but it didn't work for me at the time. The story isn't all that 'horrifying' but more along the lines of 'maybe creepy?;.The game has nice music and good horror creatures. Unfortunately, while the creatures would very work well in a Hollywood film, the games main horror is based off something the game's founder realised when his colleague was drawing on a napkin (true story).The gameplay...is a bit eh. ""the game leaves it up to you to figure out every part of its increasingly bizarre universe"" This part of the gameplay is alright except the game feels more centered towards the story. The controls are good but the actual things you need to do are a bit annoying, it feels like trying to keep a balloon in the air while moving your hands with WASD.Pros:-Somewhat creepy story-The art is alright but only actually serves to pull off the plot twist-The musical ambience is very well made-Tight controls-Nice end scene (gameplay, not cinematic)-CheapCons:-Not really that horrifying-30 minutes long-No replay value (unless this is the only game you own that you like)-Annoying gameplay at points-The game came off a napkin.

I found it looking through a list of summer sales, the silly looking banner grabbing my attention. When I noticed it was only something like $0.60 I thought, ""Why the heck not"". Honestly, I got what I paid for - whatever you decide on whether or not to get this at the end of this review, don't pay the $2. That may not sound like much money, but this game is not worth full price.Anyway, it's.. well, I wouldn't necessarily call it good, but it's oddly kind of zen? The controls are clunky (I used a 360 controller, I wouldn't recommend the keyboard) and often frustraing to handle, and the game basically just throws you in with no explanation. In a modern age spoiled by tutorials, it was an odd feeling flailing about trying to figure out the controls and how to deal with the enemies. The game only takes about 20-30 minutes or so to play (unless you're a completionist like me trying to go the extra miles for achievements) and is a series of waves where you have to defeat the enemies and save other frogs (assuming the enemies don't kill them first). Your health is gauged by how much breath you have, breathing air bubbles or the last gasps of air from enemies. There's no meter for this, instead the frog changes color and starts to spit bloodied bubbles to indicate its slowly drowning. Graphically I personally felt it looked somewhat juvenile, what may have been the point, though the frog sprites in particular weirded me out over the fact it looks like a double amputee missing its front legs. The music I felt was the best part. It's very calming but also eerie. Very good for atmosphere.Unlike many other reviews I've seen I personally did not find it all that creepy to be honest. The story is vague and completely unexplained. You play a frog, you dive down into the water where you find strange things happening to the other frogs. The enemies turned out completely different  in origin from what I expected from the screenshots and the game leaves you to draw your own conclusions about what happened. The effort for all of this is rewarded with a link to some website I didn't bother visiting. It's kind of eerie and surreal, but not really ""creepy"". I feel as though it tries very hard to be more artsy than video game, which isn't by any means a bad thing, but as with all art it's something very subjective.I don't feel as though I've lost out too badly for having only paid 60 cents, but as I said in the beginning, it is NOT worth $2.

The bubbles seem random and the NPC frogs' AI is just ""move towards player"" which is largely what the enemy does as well so I never felt a sense of achievement on saving the NPC frogs.  Other than that the graphics and art style are okay and the story is basic and pretty average in my opinion."

,Recommended,294140,11455222,"Posted: 28 July, 2014",all,Snort Cannon,They Breathe is a horror adventure game that explores the life of a frog but will you want to play this game ? In They Breathe you play as a frog who goes down to the very bottom of the ocean. So how is the game ? Its actually quite decent and its kinda freaky too. Now for the pros. The game has a great art style which has alot of colours and cool enemy design. The gameplay is quite simple and fun. Youre trying to drown the enemies without giving them air. Now for the cons. The game is incredibly short and you can pretty much beat it in half an hour. The game has a few bugs that break the game. Overall theres not much to say about this title. Its quite decent and quite creepy game. A few bugs. Also its incredibly cheap and you cant go wrong with this title. I give They Breathe a 7.5/10

As recommending this game depends entirely on what $2 US is worth to you as a buyer.It's a very short, atmospheric, arty game, with a great twist in the tale. Is that twist worth it? I was left longing for more - it fealt like build up that needed a more subversive and twisty ending. I respect the game's twist and don't want to spoil it, just noting that it felt like an incomplete narrative experience to me.But, the designers obviously have some imagination and talent - I think they may make something really good down the track if they remain independant.

Even though it is very short, 20-40 minutes, I think this game is worth $2 but you if you're on the fence, you may want to wait until a sale. I played this game on the keyboard, not knowing there was controller support, and thought it was fine. Some of the clunkiness actually made it better, in my opinion, because I really felt like it made surviving harder and the whole experience more intense.

Bob and Steve were having serious trouble breathing, despite the plethora of bubbles around them.  So in my kindness, I lead them towards the air and they darted away without so much a ""thank you.""It was about this time that I was accosted by what sounded and appeared to be jelly-fish cows.  Strange creatures, darting back and forth.  I didn't know what to make of them at first, but as they began to bump into me, knocking the air from my lungs, I knew they weren't good.To my err in judgment, I continued down after the first ""jelly-cows"" attacked me, to find a couple more friends.  Jerry and Phillis, swimming among the under sea forest.  Had that always been there?  But they too were accosted by the jelly-cows.  They wrapped their hooved tendrils around them and took them to the briny deep.  I was horrified, mortified, shocked.  Two of my friends, died before my eyes.But before I could dash to save them, I saw a glowing green bubble floating up towards me.  The stench, the putrescence...the horror that gripped my very being as the acrid stench of rot filled my lungs.  The jelly-cow had just farted into my mouth.  I gasped for air, the color draining from my body, I gasped and groped for the nearest air bubble as the green jelly-cow darted to and fro, all the while a trail of stench bubbles popping out its backside.It eventually relented and returned to the deep.  Foolishly I pressed forward.  The leaves of the trees giving way to whiskered♥♥♥♥♥♥tubes.  Perhaps this was the diet that caused such a horrid stench in the jelly-cows.  But again, to my horror, I was accosted by more jelly-cows, but these were strangely headless.  Back and forth we darted, stealing my air as they went until finally they filled to the point of breaking.  Jelly flesh exploding in all directions, hooved tendrils flapping in the water like little phallic worms.Deeper I went, more and more jelly-cows and headless monsters accosted me.  So many friends lost along the way.  Jane and Rick....Tom and Cal...Cindy and Sally....all taken before their time.  Either gasping their last breathes as they evaded the relentless monsters, or wrapped up in phallic wigglies and taken to the deep.  Until finally, to my horror...I saw my friend.  The monster was wearing my friend as a face!  I had dared to hope that someone had escaped this terrible nightmare!  But woe unto me!  It only darkened the further down I pressed!The jellied beasts were not content to return with the bodies of my friends as faces, but began to switch their desecrated skins between each other!  Passing their faces...my friends, between them as they continued to pursue me!  I can't say what drove me down.  Perhaps I knew I too was done for.  That ultimately I would die.  That I needed to know what would do this, why this would happen, why?!At the very floor of the sea, I saw it.  I saw hell.  Corpses of friends, family, strangers...perhaps a whole civilization...  Bodies stretched out before me.  Wrapped among jellied bodies and phallic hooved tendrils.  And there at the heart of this horror, a clawed pearl that wore many bodies as faces.  One was even smiling at me.  As the air slowly leaked from its body, I realized I had shared its breathe.  I had survived this long by the air leaking from its wretched hide.I had to act.  I would lure the other monsters into this demon pearl until the faces broke free and the jellies died in pursuit.  Until finally, by some miracle...I was victorious...  The demon pearl exploded and I rocketed skyward.  As I rose to the surface, I saw much flash before my eyes.  Desecrated corpses, whiskered♥♥♥♥♥♥tubes, dead jelly-cows, and the names of strangers I had never known.  As I broke the surface, gasping for air, the handful of survivors were there.  Staring blankly at me.  We had all been scarred by this experience.  We all had somehow survived this terrible ordeal, but to what end?  After seeing such a genocide of my people...what life was left in this broken shell?"

The art style looked fun, the theme of the game was interesting, and I suckered myself into thinking that it would be one of those indie games that would be great, after hearing great things about it. I was wrong. The game has no substance. Sure it could be creepy if you put yourself into that mindset, but in all reality, I felt no emotion towards the game whatsoever. The gameplay is basic. You use the arrow keys or WASD to move your little frog around the screen, and enemies come in waves to kill you. This helps push the game in the wrong direction in my opinion, as I felt like it become repetitive far too quickly, surprising being that the game is only a half an hour long.

You kind of just have to work it out on your own, its a bit wierd and quirky but i cant say i got into it , played it for around 10 minutes and started wondering what am i doing, whats the point and i just dont get it . The gameplay is a bit wierd you basically have waves/rounds of enemies that come that you have to avoid them whilst also collecting oxygen to stay alive . Heck you cant even die , an enemy just drags you off screen and it keeps going...... i thought it glitched to be honest but when i puased the game there was a retry wave option .

On the one hand its a great little indie game with nice visuals, ambient music, interesting play style, story, etc.... On the other hand it is easily finished in 30 minutes and, to me at least, just wasn't satisfying. I mean, can a game really be that short and still be worth selling? I feel like the dev's should have made a few hours worth of content before releasing this. Its only $2.00 but I would much rather pay $10 for a game that I can play for longer than it takes me to eat my breakfast. Others have said it has replay value... I see none."

But I liked everything about it: The music sets a very good ambiance, the design really drawned me in (those are quality hand made drawings),and the monsters were really ""intriguing"", making me want to know ""what the hell they were!"".The only controls you have is moving the frog up, down, left and right, and a quick swim to evade the ennemies. You need to figure out how to defeat a group of ennemies, and then it makes you dive deeper, and so on and so forth, all while keeping your oxygen supply so you dont die (they do breathe). It takes about half an hour to finish the game this way.This is not the kind of game you are going to be playing over and over again, but for the price, music, and overall great quality game, it was a well spent 2$.
