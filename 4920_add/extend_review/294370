,Not Recommended,294370,12852362,"Posted: 8 November, 2014",all,kru,"This is a poorly balanced mashup of FTL-like exploration with HOMM-style turn-based combat.  It hides its incredibly unforgiving randomness behind the disclaimer of ""Roguelike,"" yet it provides little sense of progression or accomplishment.Grinding is the name of the game here.  You'll spend the first several hours fighting the same 3 enemy types - wolves, guardsmen and thieves - over and over as you run through the same scripted scenario over and over.  The environment becomes tiresome and repetitive very quickly.  The points of interests that you'll come across aren't interesting at all.  Most of them provide some a generic text description before presenting a single ""Search"" option.  They'll either provide loot or do damage to your party.The mechanics of combat are simple, and there is very little depth to the tactical nature of the combat.  This makes each run-through (and eventual death) flat and uninspiring.  I do not feel as though I have learned anything from that run-through which will aid me in the next.  I am left with the feeling that I merely ground out a little bit more xp to become numerically stronger, to get a little bit further when I play the same series of events and combats over again.The made-for-mobile interface is reasonably polished and makes this experience less painful than it could have been.The idea of FTL with turn-based party combat is a good one.  Unfortunately, this is not the game to do it justice."

I'm going to break this down as simple as I can because there is a lot to chew.[Lazy Version] The sound is pleasing. It looks like an old disney cartoon. Characters are distinct but distinct enough to warrant more depth. The enemies are cool but lacking variety. On sale it's a yes, full price it's a maybe.The sound is fantastic in this game. Not just the music but the way it softens when you're in a menu or how it changes tempo at the end of a battle. Something about it is just very pleasing to the ears. The music in each stage is also great without being so memorable that it gets repetitive.The visuals are very reminiscent of the days of VHS tape cartoons. Think disney's robin hood or the fox and the hound. So if you're into that sort of thing, there you go. Another thing to note is the way the map folds out in little hexagons as you travel. Whenever you go to click on something the hexagon pops up and back down with a little wooden thump. Like you're playing a game with miniatures.The characters are a little bland, which is disappointing. In FTL (my only real comparison to this game) you grew a little more attached to the hirelings. They were bland by design so you put a little something into them, but the mercenaries you use in this game are give distinct features and names. It just isn't early enough to warrant individuality. You only get a handful of them so the very least the designers could have done was give them a little flesh. Which isn't a huge problem until you think of longevity.The Combat is fun, but not as diverse as it could be. Each zone has different mobs, with their own abilities and such. By the time you figure one out and get the hang of it, you get to another zone and get rocked all over again. Which I love, it keeps you on your toes as you advance, but there is no mixing. Which seems odd for any unit based strategy game. It's not repetitive, at least as far as I've played, but it would make things a lot more interesting if it did. Other than that the combat is a chess match of positions and unit abilities and chaining attacks. If you love strategy you'll like the combat.I think that's enough information for anyone on the fence, so I'll stop there."

In a game where you have a limited amount of time to balance exploring vs. getting to the end before your time runs out they wasted one of my turns to show me somewhere I couldn't go to push the DLC on me.

But you keep all of your experience when you do, so it's not like you're starting over from scratch each time. Randomly generated levels keeps monotony out of the game and you can control how long you want to spend on each level. The gameplay makes you put a lot of thought into battle strategy, money/item management and character development.Each chacter class has unique skills and equipment management/upgrade is very simple. Gold can be hard to come by and to go along with the randomly generated levels, all merchandise and item pick-ups will be different every time. It's like starting a new hand of poker, you can get lucky or you can be screwed from the beginning.A good game to have for any lover of turn-based strategy games."

The gameplay is fluid and instinctive, the music is superb and even with only 40 mins of playtime under my belt, it's had me grinning several times with some wonderful humour. One thing, easy mode does NOT mean it's easy to beat.. easy to pick up the mechanics and play certainly, but a challenge to beat without a doubt. A brilliantly executed and fun game that I suspect will have me going back for ""one more try"" for many hours to come.One thing.. there has been a slight hiccup with the pre-order DLC that the devs have responded to and sorted with haste.

So it is not surprising.But unlike many mobile made games the PC version works well and the game itself is good fun if you liek the rogue-like genre.Tactical and challenging battles keep you on your toes as you try to advance through teh random gen maps. You will die allot as you leanr the ropes.  Gold is a little hard to find, and i seem to get lots of locked chests early game but then non once i get hold of lock picks, maybe a bug or I am just extremely unlucky.Put a couple of hours into the game first time out, time flew by which is always a good sign with a game, would definatly recommend for fellow rogue-like gamers."
,Recommended,294370,12870829,"Posted: 9 November, 2014",all,Spear Deer,"So I have about 15 hours logged in this game. I've unlocked all of the characters, and all of their seperate loadouts. I did all of this on easy, which is the only game mode available to you until you beat the game once.This game is actually a lot of fun. I really enjoy a lot of aspects of it.  It does a good job of blending the resource managment that you find necessary in roguelikes with the meaningful strategic choices that are present in any good tactical RPG. The engine works pretty well, I've only had one freeze, and one sound bug. But it autosaves before every fight, so no crash is every too big of a deal.My biggest problem with this game is that it feels, mechanically and systemically, unbalanced. It seems to work at first glance, but the more you play it the more you find yourself consistently frustrated by stupid things.A perfect example of this is their equiptment upgrade paths. In the game, you upgrade your character's equptment by using upgrade materials (Iron->Steel->Gold for Weapons;Cloth->Leather->Gold for Armor). The upgrade itself doesn't add any stats to the equiptment, but rather adds a slot to it. That slot can be filled with a rune to grant various bonuses. The important thing to note here is that any upgrade is, by itself, useless. Without a rune, there is no reason to upgrade, These materials can be found in the world, or bought from the blacksmith. Now here's the thing: Each character you recruit into your party needs to start with iron before moving onto steel, but iron stop showing up in shops or the world around zone 3 of 8.  So unless you horde enough iron to upgrade all of your future recruits by the time you leave the third zone, you can never upgrade them. And this directly goes against what a good roguelike player would do. They wouldn't waste money (which is used to do pretty much everything in the game) on materials that they can't use for another 50% of the campaign. Its locking away valuble gold in useless assets.This is an EASY problem to fix. Just have certain events have an option to drop iron/cloth in later zones. Boom. Done. But this level of imbalance persists throughout the game across a lot of little mechanics.My other big concern is that the difference between 'easy' and 'norma' is the difference between night and day. The difficult jump is so large in fact, that it qualifies as a design flaw in my opinion. Not necessarily how hard it is, but the fact that you force the player to play easy mode, a lot, before unlocking normal, and then expose them, with no transition, to the insanely more difficult normal mode just seems silly. Not only that, but the differences between the two modes isn't actually explained. They mention that your characters will all start from level 1, and you are foced to fight the bosses at the end of each level, but that's just a small part of what makes it so different.The differences I've noticed are:Characters start from level 1Fewer rewards from battlesSignificantly faster enemy growthMust fight bossesMajority of objects in the world are now locked, and require a lockpickLockpicks no longer sold in storesRes scrolls no longer sold in storesMercenary selected is restricted to 2 ranom mercs selected from the roster of 9 at each tavern (biggest and most significant change after the level honestly)I am going to keep playing normal, but as of right now (especially considering how luck dependant the combat can feel sometimes) I fail to see how it's beatable.TL;DR REVIEW:Good game. Needs a few patches. Don't get excited about Normal mode though, just play and enjoy the mandatory Easy mode when its still beatable and fun."

At some point, you meet theives. Every level with theives there are invisible enemies you cannot damage or expose from their invisibility and will just kill a member of your team.The only element of skill involved with this game is inventory management, picking complimentaty either or options for character level-up, and correct placement of units on the board.That is all there is here.

The closet relative of which I'm aware is FTL in the sense that it's a game of multiple stages where the objective is to gather enough resources to beat the final boss, and most of the time (even on the Easy setting) you will not be able to do so because of the RNG.I defeated Easy in about 20 hours, and took about 8 attempts to do so once the other stage bosses were clear and I am thoroughly lame. (For instance, I did not even realize in over 8 hours of play that you could at any time in battle select of any your characters to use the next action point in a turn, and, thus, was limiting myself to the random order that the characters were selected by the game.) Each of the 9 available characters has two unlockable forms (each with one unique skill) in additional to its starting form, and so it's worth paying attention to what it takes to unlock the additional forms as you work through Easy, because otherwise you will probably have to grind a bit on Easy to do so. The additional forms are not necessary but do add variety to the available tactics.Normal is much more challenging, and I cannot imagine with my poor play skills the kind of luck that it would take for me to beat it. The bosses reset in every run on Normal, and every character starts from level 1, and so experience and food become much more relevant resources.Like Nethack, it's a fun challenge even if you have no resonable expectation of ever defeating it. It's quite a bit simpler and shorter than Nethack. (No item testing required in this game: once you know what an item does, it will do the same thing in all games and so you can safely sell the 4 poison kinds of muchrooms, for instance, once you know which they are.) You can easiliy get through even a comparatively succesful run attempt in less than 2 hours. I thoroughly enjoy this game."

Once you unlock them, your hero and any mercenaries you hire have up to 3 different possible configurations to start with2. The graphics are charming3. The equipment upgrade system is interesting to a certain point4. The combat system is quite good to a certain point...The bad:1. The game is an incremental upgrade system that basically means it's impossible to finish it on at least the first several attempts.  I finally managed to beat it on easy after about 5 or 6 run throughs - but only because you and your mercs can keep your experience points between restarts.  I can't even contemplate how it would be possible to defeat this game on Normal, where you and the mercs all start at level 1!2. The combat can be brutally difficult, with some of the encounters you face nigh on impossible - with mobs often doing absolutely impossible stuff that your characters cannot do.3. The sheer randomness of most encounters where you just don't know if a choice is going to give you something positive, negative or otherwise.4. Random combat starting positions, often meaning that you're caught spread out with enemies all around you and no way to get into a defensive postion."

Crowntakers is straight up 7/10 in its genre.I bought the game for during 25% off sale, and I must say I wasnt disappointed. On average you would probably spend about 10 hours in game anyway.Pretty graphics and somewhat easy to understand game mechanics take you in pretty quickly. It takes about 15 minutes to understand how to fight and not lose and maybe about an hour that there are actually ways to beat the game in efficient way. All comes down to how random this game is, your strategy will depend on it and it will eventually decide the outcome at the end.Fighting mechanics are very easy to understand. Game mechanics are pretty simple too, all you need to worry about is how many turns you have left. Now, I have actually never finished a game in normal mode ( it was actually called hard before) and only won ( saved the king) on easy. Modes are not so different, but on normal you can only rely on yourself, you can hardly build strategy on the go, unless you get very lucky. Yes, a lot in this game comes down to how you will get lucky or unlucky with the choice of items, skills or mercenaries.The sound is really well made. Very simple music fits the game just right. I will not spoil you experience. Other sound effects good too, everything makes the sound its supposed to make.Graphics are simple yet very attractive. I am not sure if this game was ever on a tablet, but that is the kind of graphics is has. Simple and effective and everyone can run it on their low end computer. What else do you need from a game like this?Now, what really has me going is how random this can be. I understand that is a part of the game, but boy does it make me mad sometimes. You will be enraged on occasions when things just do go your way. Fighting can be annoying too, you will be misclicking quite a lot and that might cost you dearly. Oh, and no saves, you die - you lose!The game has some basic story with its plot twist at the end, but thats about it. You dont expect a story from a board game do you? This is just the same.In the end, this game is worth buying almost at a full price. Replayablility is high as every character has 3 different sets of abilities. The game is not extremely addictive, but you would not expect that. This game will let you do simple strategy moves and relax at the same time. If you are up for challenge in both game and yourself, then this game is for you."

,Recommended,294370,33926460,Posted: 31 July,all,Lynx,"You start out with two game options. One you start and your characters will level and they will stay that level so next time you play through they are better. The other option is where your leveling is completely dependent on that game file and once its over the character restart at one(or what ever level you have them at). I have played a mixture of both and reccomend you do the first mode as a newcomer.This game reminds me a lot of FF Tatics. You have one objective to get to the end of the map/game. The map and routes will always be the same, but the Items and enemy's blocking those routes will not be. To me its something that you just slowly progress the more and more you play.If your into a game like FF Tatics or if you want a Tatics game that challenges you this is for you, just be warned I cant see you getting 100 hours+ of this, least I can't."

Content-wise, It feels shallow for the pricepoint ($15). Even though the levels are randomly generated, every time I died and restarted I still felt like I was playing the exact same level.

It's relatively short and while it's a rogue-like game and has lots of variability in the instances and a very enjoyable enviorment, it lacks variety in combat, which is the  main focus of the game. thus losing replay value pretty quickly.I love the environment of the game, the tiles flipping over, revealing the surroundings as you move along the roads is fun and the music is pleasant, but the exploration of encounters like the hovels, caves and watch towers that you can come across aren't particularly deep, most of the time you only have one or two choices, so theres no deeper pull into the story through the use of the enviorment.The combat is also super frustrating. there is no set-up phase in the game so your characters are tossed around on the field seemingly willy nilly. I can't tell you the number of times I've lost my archers because they were placed next to one or two enemy units and they were slaughtered before I could move them away or kill the units surrounding them because my melee units got placed in some random place on the far side of the map.Inspite of these things I've replayed this game many times and still enjoy it every now and then when I go back to play it.

I thought I would give it a try...and was really surprised by how many great game design choices the developers made!Examples of great game design:+ Every map is randomized - not only the map layout, but also your units' positions!+ The fight is not going well and you're in a bind.  Do you use potions now or save them for a later fight?+ Mercenaries have different abilities, and choosing which mercs to use (and their variant skills) and building combos make it fun and replayable+ Normal is quite difficult, so the ability to carry over experience after defeat in Easy mode is a great option.  (I was able to beat the game in my 2nd easy playthrough, but it was close!)+ Runes for your fighters have good variety - enough to make choosing which merc gets which runes important for battles.+ A new merc can be unlocked with each playthrough, which incentivizes playing it again and again, even if you've won already (winning one time through might only take 3-4 hours)+ Your hero and each merc have unlockable skills. To unlock them you have to do perform various feats with each hero, which incentivizes you to change your tactics each playthrough.+ On the main map, at each cave/house/roundtower/etc, you can only choose to perform one action out of 2-5 options. Once you've done the action, you have to live with your choice!  On the next playthrough, you can choose differently...+ There is a trade-off between spending time searching all the houses, caves, etc, and progressing through the map.  Every night it says ""another night has past, your enemies have gotten stronger"".  It's another design element to force the user to choose a strategy.+ The user interface, menus and buttons have a good layout and are pretty intuitive.+ The encounter stories are entertaining.

The graphics are neat, the art style reminds me of an older Disney cartoon movie, like the Sword in the Stone. The music is appropriate kind of cheerful fantasy style.The controls are entirely mouse driven, and easy to use.It has an option for a controller, but I cant get it to work, and I have no idea why you'd use a controller for this game. Trust me, I have a physical disability, and have to use a controller for most M&K based games that rely on realtime keyboard for movement and mouse for options/looking around. I'd be the first to be asking for controller support if the game needed it. This one doesn't, but has it.The full review:The help files suck and I still dont know what all those symbols with the hand and arrow on the right hand side does (Hold in inventory, give to someone, drop?)Theres not to much in the way of deep tactics, but its entertaining.Basically, you move around a hex board. You choose the direction you go, and then you walk to the next crossroads. Sometimes theres a place you can interact with (search a cottage, visit a merchant or blacksmith, an inn, cave , a fight ect). Random events happen at these places. Usually searching for small items, but other things such as HP or gold gain/loss, or nothing at allThe blacksmith and inn are used to improve your weapon/armor, buy things, rest and buy food, hire mercenaries. To improve your weapons you need to buy or loot a certain item shown in your inventory screen then take that item to the blacksmith and pay a fee. The item is upgraded. Then you take armor/weapon runes and put them in the slots you get from upgrading. The runes have different effects, and are swappable but only armor runes work with armor and vice versa.Mercenaries are the people you hire at the inn to help you fight. They can gain XP and some of their their XP is persistant even after you die. So they get better and better as you go. Every mercenary is slightly different. I have found an archer and a fighter. Each character has 2 special skills they can use to help them in battle, and they are all different for each mercenary that Ive found so far.There is a day/night cycle and after every 24 hours (shown in the lower left corner) the enemies get stronger a bit. So you have to balance searching everything and getting to the end of the map. The maps are random for each playthrough, so you dont know where everythings going to be.Fighting is done on a turn based hex grid. Its simple. Move, attack, and choose facing. The arrow that is yellow instead of red is the chars back. Backstabbing does extra damage so facing matters. There is permadeath, so when the hero dies, you have to start again. Your mercenaries keep their XP (depending on gameplay mode), though, so its not like everythings completely lost.Seems like itd be really fun on a phone if I was stuck waiting for something. I dont do the phone-as-gaming-device thing though."

It wouldn't be ""RNG"" if it were ""balanced"", RNG implies randomness which is not solely dependent on ""fairness"" ( you can flip a coin 50 times and get 50 heads).That being said, if there were ever a Crowntakers2 or DLC to extend the campaign (or institute a new one) I would buy it. -I also feel like this game could have an interesting multiplayer mode if developed.-Feels short, but then again theres a lot of content that justifies the $15 price tagRegarding some of the individual grievances against the game:Firstly, saying that this game is meant for you to fail before you succeed is incorrect.While this seems like the case in easy mode, easy mode is more of a way for you to learn and understand the true nature of the mechanics, specifically how the mercenaries work together and their individual skills. You can do a lot by combining the different skills of the mercenaries in different conformations. Another key aspect of this game is that it has a lot to do with positioning in combat. Often, people don't understand this and charge in meaninglessly. This difficulty isn't manufactured, it is intrinsic in the games design. Thinking of how you will position yourself for the enemy's phase is often more challenging than deciding what moves you want to make on your turn (which also is considerably difficult). Also, fighting thieves work on the former mechanic much more than the latter (and you can definitely win without losing anyone). While you will likely die because of your incorrect choices and on part because of the RNG, it is ultimately up to you to consider which choices are risky and which aren't.All that being said, it is entirely possible for you to succeed on the first playthrough if you fully understand the games mechanics and strategy. I won't say its likely, but it was designed so that you can progress (from level 1) all the way to the castle in one sitting, because normal mode is beatable.The game is not grinding based (once again, because normal mode is a thing) although you will need to if you want to unlock some of the different mercenary stages (which have no impact on your ability to beat the game, just your method of beating it).I'm not gonna address the QQ ""errybody conters cept me"" responses when the game hasn't been played for more than a couple hours."

Frankly I think leveled characters would make each subsequent play through too easy and mundane - it is nice to have the option there however.I know this has had some other sour reviews but I found the game to very polished and appreciate it simply because this concept hasn't been explored often enough in prior years.Unfortunately all events within the main game itself have been done countless times before but CT features solid programming effort never-the-less.I paid $10 for the main game along with Necromancer DLC.I would pay as much as $12.50 for the combo."

The upgrade system works really well and it gives you a lot of chances to find ridiculous synergies (infinite range crossbow guy gets a ""deal and take more damage"" buff, you're pretty much set for life with that). Only real problem is that the game doesn't tell you when your inventory is full (at which point you start dropping things) so you have to keep track of that manually.This is a short game (10 hours and I've beaten it twice, pretty sure I've seen everything outside of the DLC) but it's a neat experience so grab it on sale."

It's as if they made the game as a single-playthrough experience which lowers the difficulty automatically each time you fail (which would be a fine small game IMO), but then they added the replayability unlocks to it...There are unlockable heroes, which are limited to unlock only one new hero per playthrough, as well as hero-variations if you have used each hero well enough (i.e. kill 30 enemies with Hero A1 to get A2. Get Hero A to 10 strength to unlock Hero A3)If you ""just"" want to complete the game fast enough to get the achievement, this took me 7 hours.If you want to try all the different heroes as well as each of the 3 variations of the heroes, then I'm guessing it might take 20-30 hours.I suspect it will start to get rather repetitive if you're trying to unlock all the heroes though, but I was not bored during this first win.Conclusion:I'd say this game has 5-7 hours of effective gameplay, followed by an optional grind of roughly 10 hours to unlock everything (maybe less).I bought the game on sale, so I'm quite happy with the amount of entertainment I got for it.I'm not sure if I would want to pay 15 EUR for it (normal price for my country), so I recommend getting it on sale (30% off or less)."

It can be annoying, it can and will frustrate you, but this game has such a nice charm to it that I keep coming back.It's not the easiest game, it's a Rogue-lite, you WILL die, but all your characters will keep their experience and level (when playing Easy Mode). Some runs will just be to level up newer characters you unlock. I've done quite a few runs like that so far. The art style is fantastic in my opinion. Everything looks nice and fluid and the soundtrack, while not amazing, does a good job of fitting the game.Overall, I definitely recommend this game, but only for people who enjoy Rogue-lites and a bit of a grind to get characters up levels and for the final boss (which can be a pain in butt if you're low levelled).PS: If the Devs read this, I do have one big complaint, and that's the way you deploy into battle. The deploying is randomized, and more than half the time, my ranged characters would ALWAYS be right next to one or more melee enemies, which means they would be useless.

Run in, kill everything, grab all loot.Events are repetative and lack impact. Your party searches a house, the floor caves in, Lose 1hp (or get loot).A moment of FTL, for example, plays out similar to this: I was given a choice, protect a fugitive computer virus or hand it over to ""authorities"". I decided to harbor the fugitive and in return for my kindness I stared at my screen in horror as the virus infected one of my crew members and... desintegrated them.

A lot of events have random outcomes so you can't really learn a ""right"" response, which is a double edged sword.I strongly encourage new players to start on easy difficulty.  The game is very punishing, and the ability to retain levels through playthroughs can help give you some buffer while you learn how to not die.  Treat normal difficulty as a ""challenge"" mode.  Once you beat the game a few times and really understand the mechanics, and have unlocked heroes you really like, *then* try normal modeOverall the game has a weird enjoyment curve.  At the start it's really hard and seems random and unfair.  It doesn't help that the designer has the route to the DLC in game, which can cost you a lot of very important time walking towards, which is very frustrating.  once you get over the DLC, and realize AAA studios do that skeezy♥♥♥♥♥♥to you *all the time*, and you die 3 or 4 times and learn some tactics... the game becomes pretty darn fun.  Now admittedly after a few more playthroughs, once you really understand things, there becomes one or 2 optimal solutions for every set of enemies.  I'm definitly getting tired of the game faster than I'm getting through objectives (like unlocking new characters, or new loadouts for old characters), but playthroughs like 3-7 as I really started understanding the game, and working on beating the final boss, were a lot of fun"

76561197982384806,Not Recommended,294370,18264965,"Posted: 30 September, 2015",all,Lemming,"Crowntakers has far too many encounters/mechanisms that are simply poorly explained, visualized or simply far too brutal. You will rapidly find yourself facing enemies that the game says are far too tough for you if you ever make the mistake of clicking the 9H option, so why add it? The rewards for clicking 9H are laughable (+1 str that you can buy for 1 gold). Add in the random start locations taking any semblance of strategy out of the battles and you've got a game that just feels annoying rather than hard. 1 minute you're facing 5 health minions, the next you're suddenly facing 3 armor/13 health minions who can inexplicably counter attack. And the bosses who can teleport or can't take damage from melee, inexplicably, without any reason, without any warning.Obviously you're supposed to play it again and again, but other games the pressure is gradual, the challenge ever growing. This one it's, easy, easy, easy, STUPIDLY STRONG. Having played 4 games, the difficuly ramp up just isn't there, even on 'easy'. There's no balance, no finesse, no satisfaction. You simply feel like you wasted an hour of your time to get rofl-stomped against an enemy that doesn't obey the same rules and makes any sort of strategy completely pointless.I've played and loved FTL/Dungeons of the Endless/Rogue Legacy but this simply doesn't work."

The combat is interesting and it's fun to try and put together a complemetary team. And the enemies have some variance, though aren't particularly smart. The adventure part of the game is pretty basic, hunt around and gather goodies in fairly random locations to level up. There's a timer of sorts, though it doesn't really impact game play much, but it does mean you shouldn't scavenge every last spot.For $10, it's a thumbs up. On sale, it's a great value. I've won 3 times and felt like I got value out of it. The replay level really drops off though, so take it for what it is, a fun 10-30 hours depending on how much the combat grabs you.If you like this game, you'd probably like Reknown Explorers: International Society."

I've played this for nearly 20 hours and I have to agree with most of the negative reviews, Dont waste your money. This had the potential to be a great game but it is onesided and often to predictable. the only thing you have going for you is pure chance during strategic map movement, and the only thing you have going for you in Tactical Combat is pure Time in game and high level character and mercs, otherwise you are going to lose. I agree , they could make this much more enjoyable, especially considering the continual re-run of the same monotonous crap in order to get your character and mercs to a high level.  It's enjoyable on a play one map and leave the game alone for a while level.  Otherwise I wish I could get a refund and wait for a similar game that actually makes adventuring not so dang predictable... Oh look a group of thieves that for some reason still have tons of Invisibilty potions...

Extremely random with too few player choices and not enough information about the choices that are available.  The only rogue-like aspect to the game is permadeath.Maps are presnted as a hex grid  for no particular reason since map movement is point to point. Each of the several possible encounters can be met once & the player must make his choice without any suggestion of possible outcomes.  Few encounters well balanced.   Many cannot be avoided.    Once the player has exited a map he cannot return to it.  As a result, if the player encounters a situation which he cannot beat in his current condition there is rarely a way to improve the character and try again.Combat begins with players characters  deployed on a hed grid map, frequently with no opponents in view nor any suggestion of their location.  Nearly always surprised even though the text says that player is aware of opponents.  It is not uncommon for player's characters with seven or eight hit points each to face four or more opponents each with six to fifteen hit points, when played on easy.That the devs assume that placing the player into situations in which he has no chance of success makes for amusing game play is but one mark of their shortsightedness.Camping & inns do not replenish hit points and rewards for the rare battle victory are inadequate for character survival.There is no sense of progress.  No feeling of having learned how to increase the character's chance of success in subsequent games.The entire game could be condensed to having the player roll a die at the beginning and then declaring him failed or victorious.All in all a poorly designed game utterly lacking in the elements that that would make it enjoyable.The game is not difficult it is highly random with an extremely restrictive choice basis.  That means that the player's chance of completing each level is very small.The first level has eight to ten encounters.  Each encounter has two or three options.  Each option may have up to a half dozen outcomes.  Since each encounter occurs once per game sampling each of the possible  options on the first level  alone requires between 64 and 512 plays.It is relativly easy to reach the second map but highly unlikely that the play weill have gained enough knoweldge/experience from the first map to effect his chances of surviving to the third.The second map is a bit less random.  It has more combat encouters  but opponents are significantlhy stronger.  I place the probability of surviving any one combat between one-quarter and one-third call it 7/24.  There are four combat encounters, I believe.  The chance of surviving all of them would be about 1/140.  It takes 97 plays to have a 50% chance to complete this level.If you are willing to play the game a couple hundred times you might make it to the next map.Though there a many player choices on each map the outcome of each choice has a high variability.  That means that very little of the information you have garnered from previous game play will contribute to your choices in your current game.Since each map has few opportunities for character improvement unpassable roadblocks are common.It is these last two points where this game fails as a rogue-like.  The best rogue-like games present problems for the player and provide him with opportunities to surmount them.  The worst rogue-like games simple provide scads of random events.WazHack & Bionic Dues ae both good rogue-like games.  Crowntakers is not."

In order for you to unlock your companions, their levels, items and steam achievements there are quite some randomness involved and enthusiastic music so it wouldn't be such a chore.The names of the ""difficulty levels"" (more of a game modes) are misleading. ""Easy"" means actually ""progression"" since in the beginning it is impossible to finish it with your level one hero. ""Normal"" means that once you have unlocked all companions and their items in the ""easy"" mode you have a chance to finish this mode.Conclusion: It's fun little game for some time. If you like RGP's with turn based tactical battles then you like this game as well.P.S. If they won't make the OST available as DLC soon then i have to rip it somehow from the game."

The map is linear with tree-branching roads that form the overground ""dungeon"".There is turn based strategy on the battle-fields, and there is engine-building strategy at the blacksmith's shop for arranging how buffs are set up.  Tuning the party can make a big difference.The art-style is not too misleading - this is a relatively easy game.  It was difficult at first, but after several hours it starts to feel trivial.Because of the RPG style, dice-rolls (RNG) can add tension at times, which is good.Not a great game, but it's good - if you are a fan of the genre and you see it on sale, it's worth trying out."

The final boss is pretty terrible though - it breaks basically every single rule of the game that you've learned up to that point and there seems to be no real strategy to it. The way they handle difficulty is also poor - you are stuck on ""easy"" mode until you grind enough to kill that boss, then you can play ""normal"" mode where all of your progress is permanently lost forever and you are unable to make any more progress. Significant flaws, but fun for a few hours. I'm also having trouble seeing how the final boss would even theoretically be possible starting at level 1 every time as you do on normal mode, probably you need to find some kind of semi-exploit to beat it."
