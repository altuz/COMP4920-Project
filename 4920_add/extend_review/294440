The art was nice and the puzzles appropriate and complex. Nothing felt forced in the game and I didn't feel like I'd missed anything by not playing the original game. There wasn't anything that particularly stood out about this game above others in the genre, but I felt it was very solid and enjoyable. The only real annoyance was the time it took to get anywhere which could be a little bit of a problem later in the game when the puzzles spanned more space or were more complex to solve."

,Recommended,294440,11813391,"Posted: 21 August, 2014",all,Kenuty,"A remake of the original game from the Nes, Shadowgate is a  click and point adventures that follows the original retro style redone  with voice acting, animated graphics, and the complicated puzzles changed up to blow your mind in fustration but full of satisfactory when solved. Fans of the original Shadowgate will love the remake of this game and the feeling of retro nostalgia.The game starts with an animated opening accompanied by a  great soundtrack and voice narration that will give you the immersion and overhwelming feeling of  epicness to your adventure to conquer the castle and stop an evil warlock.Though not everything is voiced in the game except for major plotline cutscenes for the story. The game still does a great job with the  text dialogue. The graphics will remind you of a really well done animated  graphic novel if you've ever experienced any of those. The gameplay itself a click adventure puzzle game and might not be everyone's cup of tea.Upon playing the game and starting off your adventure you'll be greeted with 3 different difficulty mode to the game, each of which changes up the solution to the puzzles to the game and stop players from thinking they know the puzzles after playing the first time. Along with starting the adventure you'll be given a well detailed tutorial that explains how the mechanics, and how the game works. This isn't your usual point and click adventure but a retro gameplay style with the player having to use hotkeys and clicking on top for buttons to execute commands such as use, speak, or even to open doors and move forward etc. So an example is  in order to get in through a door to the next area  to progress you'll have to first open the door or you'll run headlfirst into it.The game will feature puzzles that are pretty complex and feels VERY satisfying when you actually solve it. The game does give you hints hidden in well written riddles and text on spells, items, and scroll you find in order to progress.  Upon being stuck however, players  do have the ability to talk to your only sidekick skull partner Yorick who at times talk alot but does give you hints also in riddles  but unless you paid attention to certain surrondings and the riddles, you'll be stuck at certain areas for quite a bit.The way to solve certain situations sometimes is trial and error sometimes and  be warned however that making a mistake at certain locations and it's death for you in many ways. There are creatures in this castle to stop you along the way such as krakens and dragons.  Luckily the game does offer saving and  quicksave to keep on playing. To add on to this the game has a mechanic that everything you do is considered a move except for looking. So each time you are using a move your torch is slowly diminishing. If you run out of torches you'll have no choice but to restart a previous save becuase leaving  will make you fall in the dark and break your neck. Along with the torch there will be another element later in the game that will be more brutal on you forcing you to quicken your pace a bit.The one thing about the game is when you do die you'll die in a gruesome way. Along with death flying along and giving you a speech about your misery sometimes in a humorous manner. So try not to die and do your best at the puzzles, Read, look, and tread carefully in this castle of doom.+ Animated graphics+ Well written dialogue+ Voice over and cutscenes are nicely done+ Immersive Music+ Complex puzzle with 3 different difficulty and change up+ includes retro voice, music, and audio from the nes version that you can switch to- When you get stuck its pretty brutal don't give up- The retrostyle interface might not be everyones thing- The only downside is once you know the solutions then thats pretty much it for the game."

More clicks for the counter! One of the rooms in the first Hall by the dragon gets inexplicably blocked by an energy force, so you have to walk the long way around, up through the Mirror-room floor.Oh and the mirror room.

I found a gear somewhere, but needed a walkthrough to find the mechanism in the floor where it goes.. except it doesn't go there. Actually you have to pry off one of the existing gears in the hatch with your sword, to see the lever positions, then put the gear back to use them.How about the Library, remember the library? Red gem in the hole opens the bookcase...Or how about clicking twice (once to open the menu, once to activate the book) on every book in 2 rows until you find 5 books that unlock the wall! If 'click everything until it works' is your security system, just use a doorknob!Don't forget to use the rope & grappling hook on yourself to separate them if you forgot to climb down into the well before opening the drawbridge! You'll need the guantlet to piuch out the second troll, oh were you expecting to use that on an acid fountain?Oh, and periodically return to the very start of the game to add a skull to the doorway. Yes, rune skulls act like batteries, 'activating' the mechanisms in the castle as if it were Devil May Cry.Ya, so about that banshee. All of the hours my profile say that I have spent playing the game so far? ♥♥♥♥ing garbage! Back to square one! If you do pick it up, look up how to get the antidote, and get it ASAP!"

The puzzles are logical and you get as many hints as you want (or need) to solve them.Unfortunately, the game is quite short and shortly before the end, you have to do a little fetch quest with a lot of backtracking. I would advise against doing longer breaks between game sessions because of this.

So much that I convinced the store to give me a refund for it.Ironically, nostalgia makes me love this game.This version plays just like the original, but gives you options to drastically reduce or increase the difficulty.This game is full of obscure, hard to find path ways and solutions, and totally unfair deaths.If you enjoyed the older adventure games like DejaVu, BAT / BAT 2, Neuromancer, then you'll enjoy this.People wanting more immediate gratification, or with less patiience, will probably want to stay away."
76561198033802030,Recommended,294440,18067307,"Posted: 16 September, 2015",all,sudo sandwich,"Summary: Adventure game with dead-endsMultiplayer: NoCompletion: 6 hrsCards: YesCloud: NoI remember seeing Shadowgate for NES in magazines as a kid, and always wanted to try it out, but they never had it at my rental store. Now I get to have that chance, with much nicer eye candy. And... I must say it didn't disappoint, but it clearly is not a game for everybody.You take on the role of Jair. You want to beat the Warlock Lord. From there the story doesn't really get more complicated that that. It's pretty much your standard good-vs-evil tale. I would have liked some character development through dialogue. For example, there's a lady in a tower who would have been a good choice to converse with, but, well, that becomes moot pretty fast. Sure you become more powerful throughout the course of the game, but Jair never says anything short of grunts and tricks or treats.Shadowgate comes from an era where dead-ends are both possible and common. I'm still against this design philosophy, but I can't totally blame them for wanting to keep the spirit of the original. Just be forewarned that it's quite possible to screw yourself over, so save often and in different slots. Speaking of which, I would have much liked the ability to name my save files. It gets kind of hard to tell which save is which..Shadowgate boasts some very nice artwork, and is easy on the eyes. There's a fair amount of clutter in each scene, but I didn't have much difficulty picking out interactable objects, even without the use of F2. Retro graphics on the other hand is very harsh on the eyes. I recommend against using that, as it makes everything difficult to discern. I thought it would replicate the NES look, but instead it's like they took a mosaic filter and applied it to the screen. The music is pleasant, and fits the game quite nicely. It's never out of place and never obtrusive. Even better, the retro music works pretty well.The interface is a tad on the clunky side. The inventory menu has a brief delay before you can interact with it, which is problematic when you need to access it so frequently. Thankfully you can set bindings, but that's more of a band-aid fix than a proper solution. The ability to use scroll wheel to go through items would have been nice. I suggest learning the keyboard shortcuts, as they will help speed up your progress in subsequent playthroughs. If you play the game entirely with the mouse, certain things feel remarkably slow.There's 4 difficulty levels as of the time of this writing - Normal, Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master. I ended up playing through all of them in order, and I will say there's a pretty good progression. What worked once before might work differently in a higher difficulty.  I had the most fun with Journeyman difficulty which provides a generous time frame, but lacks puzzles exclusive to Master, which hampered the enjoyment a bit. Master difficulty on the other hand is overkill. I nearly failed both curing myself and beating it by less than 20 turns each. I thought I had a firm grasp on what I needed to do to win, but apparently not!From Apprentice difficulty and higher (all the ""Classic"" modes), the game starts to institute hard time limits, primarily in the way of torches. You only have so many turns before your torch flickers out and die. Torches aren't too difficult to find, even on Master difficulty. In all liklihood, you will probably die to the other natural time limits set by the game, especially on Master difficulty.Compounding the time limit problem is the abundance of items that do absolutely nothing. At least in Bethesda games you can sell all that junk you acquire. In here, the items serve to waste your time and nothing more. Unused items just makes the game feel unfinished. Yes I know they're red herrings, but they feel like an oversight, especially for the adventure game genre.The game tries its darnedest to be as cryptic as possible sometimes. Most obvious case is in regard to spells. There's no way anyone would know what the spells do, as the game provides vague descriptions when you examine and cast them. And on Master difficulty you really can't spend turns casting spells willy-nilly.Most of the puzzles in the game make... some amount of sense. The early difficulties are easy enough to figure out on your own, at least with the help of Yorick. The later difficulties I admit to using a guide. Many altered puzzles have solutions I didn't see clues for. When have I ever needed to make a green fire or get a wet cloak?Overall I found Shadowgate to be enjoyable enough to sit through it through all difficulties. While I can't fault it for trying to be faithful to the original, I can fault the original for its curious design choices. If there's one thing I would have liked, it's the ability to play on Master mode without time limits, because I enjoyed the sheer number of things to see in there, but had no time to see all of it. I think Shadowgate falls into a 7/10.EDIT: Bunch of spelling errors and grammar."

,Recommended,294440,13626023,"Posted: 26 December, 2014",all,Grimmblut,"This game enthralled me long enough to finish it on normal mode and I purchased it at a discount, so I'll be fair and give it a ""thumbs up"". There are quiet a few things you should consider if you plan to buy this, though:- It's not an RPG in any way regarding skilling, equipping or upgrading your character. You don't have skills, attributes or whatsoever you could manage or upgrade. You can't buy or sell items and all items you find in the game are basically ""use item x for adventure element y (e.g. use the only arrow you'll find in the whole game against precisely one specific enemy).- There are no fights in the classical sense. You don't aim or use skills or the like against enemies. You use item x, which is specifically designed to be used in this ""fight"" on the enemy or another item to win the fight.- There are some clues about what to do, but like in most adventures, you'll end up several times with spamming item x or ability y on everything you can to see if it has any effect. I felt really lost during the late game when I was just running around and trying to figure out where's the chance to progress with the game.- There are NO, I repeat, NO possibilities for alternative ways to get around a challenge. You either stick to the scripted plan of using item a on element b in situation c after you've accomplished event d or you are srewed. That's actually the reason why adventures died out some time ago.- I needed 6 hours to finish the game. That's a pretty short time to play through a game. You can choose to play the game on different difficulties, and I've read that some puzzles are different then. Nonetheless, I consider the replay value of this game to be like the reeat value of a pizza.If you've played the original Shadowgate (and liked it) or if you're a huge fan of fantasy adventures, you may give this game a try. All others should really think about if they really want to play this game."
,Recommended,294440,12721879,"Posted: 1 November, 2014",all,Xafron Chi 宁 静,"I was excited to see yet another old game I played on NES had been remade and released on Steam (the other being Gauntlet)!  The original was released in 1989 on the NES, and was a lot of fun (though very difficult) when I played it as a kid.The new one is just as tough, and has a new and very beautiful art style.  A nice soundtrack was made for this as well, though after exploring the options menu I saw there were options to make this game feel more like the original, ""retro"" Shadowgate.  One of those options was to have the old soundtrack play instead!  There's other options as well to make it feel more like the old version.  They did good there.So what is this game...well it's an old school point-and-click adventure game.  Extremely heavy puzzle elements that will get you killed and/or confused.  A lot.  There are ways for you to fail this game, without you even knowing it right away too.  You'll be unlocking new areas, as well as a fair amount of backtracking.  There are also a lot of items to be had, you'll want to get most of them because you never know when they might be of use.They've introduced some different difficulty settings, and the ability to either play the game with no saves or with the ability to save.  Unless you have the hints option on, there's really not much in the way of handholding.  And even with the hints, it doesn't really tell you much.Great game, and worth checking out if you like games that really make you think and pay attention to details.""It's a sad thing that your adventures have ended here.""  Get used to seeing that a lot."
,Recommended,294440,25829835,"Posted: 2 October, 2016",all,Audish,"Not many adventure games reached the classic NES, but Shadowgate was a stand-out among the few that did. The merciless journey through a deadly castle allowed you unprecedented freedom to Take, Open, Drink, and Hit just about anything you came across in the game world. Now Shadowgate has been re-imagined for the modern era, which means new graphics and new interfaces for a new audience. Surprisingly, it might still be plenty familiar to the masochists that loved the original as well.The first place new Shadowgate diverges from the original is in the story, though it might not be immediatly apparent how much it does. You, being a strapping young warrior, are summoned by a mysterious wizard to the living castle of Shadowgate. Within its lethal, enchanted walls is an evil warlock seeking some world-ending power, and it's your job to puzzle up a way to stop him. Along the way you'll learn plenty about the circle of wizards who once inhabited the castle, the power they protected, and the lands beyond.In terms of gameplay, this is a first-person point-and-click adventure. Each room is a static scene with features to examine and items to gather. Clicking on something brings up a context menu that allows you to perform all sorts of actions like looking, taking, opening, using, and more. Some items need to be used on yourself, some need to be combined, and so on. The objects you find are also helpfully sorted by type, which is a blessing once you realize how many damn scrolls you're going to find.The other thing you'll find is a plethora of ways to die. OG Shadowgate wasn't shy about murdering you for daring to pick up a book or dipping your toe in a pool of water, and the remake carries over some of that, though most are locked behind the game's many difficulty levels. Most fatalities will come at the hands of the few monsters that serve to block your progress at different points. They tend not to be hard to dispatch but there's usually one correct option among a mess of more obvious ones. For example, one enemy can be dealt with by simply punching it in the face, but using any sort of weapon or spell on it means instant death.This also brings me to my chief complaint about the game, the obscurity of some of the puzzles. Adventure games have thankfully moved far away from the days of cat hair mustaches and helium bubblegum tooth heists, but some still have problems directing the player to the right conclusions. There are plenty of puzzles in Shadowgate that have simple solutions that simply aren't telegraphed in any way, like the cure for the banshee curse or the ability to remove runes. You're sure to run into situations where you know what to do but not HOW precisely to do it, but also situations where it's just not clear how to progress.Luckily this isn't a particularly damning complaint, because the game provides significant help like a very specific hint system (his name is Yorick) and a useful map that marks important points of interest. It also helps that you'll be exploring some rather lovely painted scenery, accompanied by quality sound work and inspiring riffs on the original soundtrack. And there are even retro options that make the game more like the original, setting some of the gameplay systems and interfaces and even the music back to their classic incarnations.It's something you don't often see in remakes, a gradient of options between old and new, but it illustrates the love and attention that went into making it. And it doesn't hurt that there's a quality adventure that stands on its own hidden underneath. There's enough of the original Shadowgate here that longtime fans will appreciate the arcane puzzles and sudden fatalities, along with enough innovation to keep newcomers hooked.Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them athttps://goldplatedgames.com/or on mycuration page!"

Great art and atmosphere!Sadly I can't recommend the game due to the absolutely inept decision to add the banshee curse system. In what world was that a good idea? The fact that it's a cheap screamer aside which doesn't fit into the rest of the genuine horror it makes you risk wasting your current playthrough if you don't know precisely what to do and where to go to fix it.Fools on me for spending 4 hours on a playthrough trying to cure the curse. I can't just continue like in the original.The torches are timers enough. We don't need this BS.

Only people who have played the original get to fully enjoy some of the nods in the redux. How you proceed in the remake has changed greatly from the original and infact what were solutions to problems in the original now kill you in somewhat humorous ways and even offer secret death endings which I greatly enjoyed.""point and click adventure"" is a name that has been slightly tarnished with games that have you find 10 objects on a still screen while a timer ticks down (you know what I am talking about) but shadowgate tells a story and makes you think.

Later on it saw a resurgence on the Gameboy Color also by Nintendo. This rebooted version has more modern looking graphics. The gameplay is still basically the same, though the HUD we were used to from the original is no more. Playing out the game it seems to be very similar to the original with subtle differences to the layout and puzzles, making it a new challenge to play. I recommend playing it on the hardest difficulty to get the most rewarding experience for those who are familiar with the original game.Normally rebooted games are something you would approach with caution, but this game did a good job of keeping the story intact, while making it a more modern playthough.

,Not Recommended,294440,20326975,"Posted: 5 January, 2016",all,ViciousRaptor,"Shadowgate is a point-and-click adventure game where you are tasked with defeating some evil lord or another by interacting with objects, learning new spells (that interact with objects) and having objects interact with other objects.There is some sort of combat to it in the form of using the right objects during combat but it's more in the form of an interactive story (with perma-death) than an actual dungeon crawler.The interface is unresponsive, there's a map that allows you to see what rooms you have visited but you can't fast-travel so that means you'll be doing a lot of clicking to get to the room you want to go to.Unfortunately, there's also a time-limit to the game. After a certain amount of clicks, you will die. This means you can mess your save game up if you don't complete the objectives that instigated the time-limit on time.I also thought it was rather difficult to figure out what the spells do, their description is vague and the whole game kind of boils down to just trying to combine every object in your inventory with the objects you see strewn about (and those are rather numerous as there are also objects which are only present as filler)The time-limit really bummed me out, the sluggish interface annoyed me and the interactive story-like combat made me want to play a real dungeon crawler instead."

I can sum it up with one example: I ran into a goblin, my fist instinct is to kill it with my sword. But no, he dodged that and killed me. After exhausting every logical option I could think of I resorted to looking up a guide, it turns out I hand punch him instead. What kind of sense does that make? Something that does less damage and has shorter range works better just because that's what the developer wanted me to do."

And of course, that iconic unpassable slime when you open the incorrect coffin.Then much things that does not belong to shadowgate was added, for example those statues you can use theinvokainspell on, and the sphere that is aquired by putting the white gem into the slot (in the old gameboy version) is changed in a heavy way that requires it to be ""charged"" with different elementals.So basically:If you never played the original classic Shadowgate, then this game can be seen as a new adventure game.If you however played the original classic Shadowgate, you will be very disappointed by this game."

You start off with just a nudge out the door, a torch and a dirk and are charged with the quest of vanquishing evil in the living castle of Shadowgate.The game is loaded with puzzles, traps, and head-scratching moments depending on your chosen difficulty.  Having said that, I distinctly remember the NES version being far easier.  Perhaps the hardest difficulty wasn't the best idea...The menu options are pretty much the same as they were, but the full-screen approach to the UI is a nice change away from the classic version.  You get to see far more of the environment and the amount of detail that went into the hand-painted imagery.As I delve further and further into the game, I find some of the puzzles famliar but often with new twists (also thanks to the difficulty).  It's tough, at times, and potentiallly frustrating as all good puzzle games should be.The music is atmospheric and adaptive, laced with familiar nostalgic themes from the classic. The artwork is nice and crisp and the added storyline so far makes it far more immersive than its original form.For exta nostalgia, they have options to utilize some of the classic NES features such as the music and room transitions.I would recommend it to fans of the original and fans of point-and-click adventures (like Myst and its ilk).

The game is too easy. The puzzles are straightforward, too easily solved, and there's never enough death to punish the player. Sometimes the game won't even kill the player at all. So when a remake of the original Shadowgate was announced, my one fear was that it was now going to be too easy. Little did I know the game would be every bit as difficult as the original.It's as difficult as the original, but not quite as brutal. The original Shadowgate sometimes had passages you could move into that existed only to kill you the moment you went into them. Or it had traps that came out of nowhere with no hint you were walking into a trap. In this manner, Shadowgate has done away with the cheap kills, doing away with the need to constantly save in every room.Some gamers may not be able to embrace this style of gaming anymore. Its point and click and the gameplay revolves entirely on selecting verbs to interact with the objects, like ""use sword on goblin."" But for me, this is pure good nostalgia. Shadowgate is a game I grew up with and this is a great return to form. It's close enough to the original to push all the nostalgia buttons, but it has its own new cool style as well. The puzzles are familiar, but never quite the same as the original game. In my own subjective opinion I couldn't have asked for a better remake. I only hope they give Deja Vu and Uninvited the same treatment."

The graphics are absolutely amazing, and one of the reasons why this is an amazing game. The music also helps, it's amazing and haunts you with how great it is. I'm gonna have to say this is one of the best remakes of a game, with one of the best openings to a game."

Here comes the breakdown:Graphics: Not too bad at all, but any time there is an intense animation on my screen, I get a very noticable framerate drop in the animation itself. The good looking scenery is actually a little bit of a hindrance, because the environment doesn't offer a lot of context clues on items to be picked up or alternate rooms to go into. Everything blends together a little too well.Sound: AMAZING. Orchestral arrangements of the classic music, decent sound effects.Controls: The UI is clunky beyond belief. SCUMM worked back in the day, but In the modern era, not so much. Not tweaking the interface (and actually making it worse at times with what changes were made) for the sake of nostalgia is a bad design choice. The inventory system is horrible. Click command. Open inventory. Click on item. Close inventory. Click on environment.Gameplay: I  remember the old NES version well enough to remember most of the puzzles, but when the devs added in their new content, everything falls apart. They provide little to no context as to what you need to do, and the in-game hint system is a joke. They also put in a ""banshee curse"" in the beginning section which will eventually kill you, and if you take too long getting through the game and can't complete it in time, you will have to start over from the very beginning. These two elements together ruin it for me.A good adventure game should make you have an ""Ah-HA!"" moment when you get to the next section, not cause you to punch a hole through your monitor out of frustration when you hit the next barrier of progression.Overall score: 5/10"

Much like other well-done re-imaginings, Shadowgate's first impression is outstanding. 2D and well drawn, I can't help but feel the nostalgia I get when I play the original. Thankfully the game also has new puzzles mixed in and they make that point clearly early on. This isn't just a re-make with the same everything from before. Twists and changes to the formula make it so that even veteran players still have a ""fresh"" experience."
,Not Recommended,294440,13858769,"Posted: 5 January, 2015",all,DORAMATIC,"I did not enjoy the adventure/puzzle aspect of the game I just did not find it interesting or fun, it's not as hard as it is obtuse its more about exploration than anything else. I didn't like that there is just a ton of going back and forth and the game has 100+ rooms if you think about it the game is just a corridor of rooms you go up and down over and over. Then with the pick-ups the vast majority of them do nothing and are just there for flavor. Surprisingly there are not a lot of items needed to beat the game. I suppose the difficulty is primarily based on your time limit more than puzzles but I find that just makes the game more annoying because then you have to restart completely if you run out of time.What I do consider good about this game is that they built a world because there is just so much stuff that has nothing to do with the solution there are even side-quests and many things that you will not see if you only stick to the path. There is still a problem with that though because its a time limited game I don't feel that the exploration aspect really fits though I do applaud the fact that it is there.The extra difficulties are nice as well, especially since they made the puzzles different, so playing on higher difficulties changes the game slightly. Unfortunately I don't find the lower difficulties to be necessary. They are too easy and master difficulty is not any harder just ""longer"" by a few steps here and there. I think there's a stigma that this game is super hard and they tried to reinforce this with the difficulty levels but starting at anything below master is really just a waste of time.In closing I also want to say I was a bit disappointed in that there were not as many deaths as I thought there would be because I thought that was a big part of the game. I might have fallen from a few things or gotten shanked by some goblins but nothing I didn't see coming. From what I understand most of the deaths, or at least the good ones, you have to actually try to find. If you stick to solving the game though you will not die very often or at all which is the opposite of what I was expecting."

I was only 4 years old at the time, playing it with my dad, but I remember it quite vividly.  My dad and I had a great time with all of the MacVenture games when I was a kid, and I was very excited when I heard about the remake more than 25 years later.The new version does not disappoint.   It has everything that was fun about the old ones, with much nicer graphics(though still definitely not AAA level, they are quite charming in their own way)  and new puzzles.  While it definitely pays homage to its predecessor this is not just a nostalgia trip; This is a very solid adventure game that stands on its own merit.  I would recommend it to any fans of the point and click genre, irrespective of age or whether you've played the old versions.One nice thing about this game compared to many other point and click games is that there are four distinct difficulty levels that  make major changes to what puzzles you will face.  This option makes the game accessible for novice/casual player while still providing a challenge for the most hardcore players.  Also, if you start on one of the lower difficulty levels, you can play again on a harder level and its almost like a whole new game, with all sorts of new items and puzzles.If you are not into point and click adventures you probably won't be into this, but if you do like this kind of game this is definitely one of the better ones."

Not only does this game still have that timer, but worse, they enforce a mandatory curse that will end your game every time unless you can solve it.

No nonsensical (il)logic puzzles, although having said that, it was (save for Starship Titanic) generally always the 3rd person point'n'click variety that had that type of thing......Shadowgate has just the kind of stuff that's typical to first-person adventure games, but most definitely at the easier end of that continuum (nothing like Schizm or Rhem here (at least not so far)).Reminds me a little of Zork Inquisitor (just without the overt humour) although having said that it does seem that much of its text could be read as being very subtly toungue-in-cheek (I'm not a fan of obnoxious, flip and glib commentary in video games and thankfully there's none of that here).Altogether a very enjoyable game (if you're into 1st person adventures and aren't looking for something that's going to play like a graphically enhanced mensa test, as so many of the 1st person adventure games of the past have tended to do).The biggest (and for me really the only) potential problem I've encountered so far is the possibility of overlooking relevant objects and actions (if you don't want to pixel hunt every node and be subjected to skimming the same descriptive text over and over again, which you would almost certainly have to do on the higher difficulty setting (and why anyone would want to play like that is beyond me. For me (outside of the crazy logic typical of the 3rd person point'n'click adventrures) that's the biggest flaw in the adventure game format.)).Thankfully there is a hint system and a button to reveal the hotspots and on the easier difficulty, all possible actions appear in the context menu when you click on each hotspot (one cavaet to that is that I have to say that (apart from Telltale's adventures) I don't think I've played a single adventure game that isn't incompletable due to broken design or glitchy programming. One can only hope that Shadowgate can be updated should that be the case here).One criticism I do have, is the relatively poor quality of the sound-files. I've got an Asus Xonar Essence STX driving a mid-range 3-point speaker setup that staggered the reviewers for their quality within their price range. One common criticisms of my speaker setup was the quality of the trebble, and while, for the most part, it's more or less unnoticable, the sound that Shadowgate's pushing out of my speakers is sharp to the point of discomfort. It's the first time I've experienced this with my speakers and it almost sent me -- thinking there might be a fault somewhere in my setup -- reaching over to check my hardware.I'm not sure why Shadowgate's sound should be as it is, unless for file-size convenience but I can only imagine that on cheaper speaker setups, or worse still, the kind of speakers that are built into monitors, Shadowgate's sound may very well, rather than just failing to enhance the game, be tinny enough to actually mar the experience.My sound set up is capable of creating sound that envelopes and absorbs the player into it but Shadowgate's sound almost seems like it's doing its best to be impenetrable, to the point of almost feeling kind of repellent, and it's a shame. I wanted to turn the volume up and have Shadowgate's audioscape unfold around me, but unfortunately the quality was just not there. It would seem that with no size-restrictions in terms of limited CD or DVD space, games these days could have very full, very clear audio but unfortunately that just doesn't seem to be the case with Shadowgate. Maybe they just didn't want the sound to upstage the graphics, who knows...)"

If you haven't bought this game yet, buy it now!I loved the old game and played it for hours as a kid, can't tell you the amount of fun i had playing this game back in the day and this is far from a money grab. They improved and changed alot, there is still some stuff there that helps if you had played the game previously, but not enough to prevent challenge to the game. I know some people are saying it's not as good because it can be clunky but in all honesty part of the challenge to the game back in the day was having to run around the castle. I feel that in the modern age of gaming people are becoming too used to linear games and quickly lose interest in anything that lacks that. I'm not saying it's their fault but games have changed from being a challenge based form of entertainment to a linear play through movie and if there isn't enough action to pull your attention for 75% of the game it then is labeled as ""dry"" or ""boring"" But the lack of linear game play is  refreshing for this old school gamer. There is plenty of challenge and a great atmosphere that reminds me of the old game and I have to say being a huge fan of shadowgate this is a great throw back to one of the games that made me love the fantasy and horror genre.

If I had one gripe, it's that you can get cursed with a time limit death that doesn't reset - when you resume your game you can die and die over again if you haven't crafted a cure.  That was annoying.  It forces you to restart and blaze through it at superfast speeds in order to have time to figure out the puzzles later.  We only really heed one time limit - the torches.  Adding a second is kind of a pain in the butt.Still, I recommend it for nostalgia's sake, and it really is a well made adventure with lots of humorous callbacks to the 1987 original."

One of the best things about this game is the ability to revert some of the settings to retro, so that you can get some of the feel of the original.  I would recemmend that anyone who played Shadowgate when they werre young play this game, and anyone too young to remember the original should play it just because it's an awesome game with a great soundtrack."

I own copies of the NES original, n64 version, and TurboGrafx CD version (Beyond Shadowgate).   So, being a fan I must had to buy the special edition with the OST. Now, I have not played the remake much as of yet...but playing through the first screens It became quite obvious that it was done with care and homage to the original versions. The new art is very nicely done and sets the tone. The game is true to the original and has familiar settings and puzzles.  I really enjoyed how you have the ability to change things to back to retro.  I personally enjoy turning on the retro music, screen transitions, and text.  Fantastic remake.  If you enjoyed the originals, do yourself a favor and play this.  Well worth it.A side note about the sound track:The Vanstratho metal mix is absolutely kick♥♥♥♥♥ All the original NES music metalified. I think I loved it the most when I first heard the death music chime in at 3 min 35 sec of the song and then go from acoustic to distortion until the song ended."

It seems quite long, and it is very overwhelming, but since I enjoyed it so much so far and intend to go on until the end, I thought making it some justice by saying how good it is.- very old school: it's a remake of a 87 classic reminding me of my journeys on Atari ST)- very rich: items inventory is huge, gameplay is not only point n click based, but the more complex style ""point n choose your action"", like take open look use etc.- pretty: although I say this criteria in an objective way, because personally I thought it looks a bit too amateurish, sometimes awkward, and much too much ""photoshop layer A photoshop layer B photoshop layer C""... but the work on it is quite honorable, whether you personally like it or not (don't get me wrong, I do not particularly like it, but it is not unpleasant to look at in gaming terms- aesthetically speaking now that's another story- the story seems simple and traditional so far, nor surprising nor boring, but I suppose that's the remake thing- many places to go, many things to click, many items to pick and use, many spells to try out...- the music is fine, nothing spectacularI can not remember how much I paid for it, and one could argue it looks a bit like these casual games on tablets, but all in all, I think at a reasonable fee this game is really worth it. You enjoy point n clicks? You like the oldschoolish looks of it? do not hesitate, it is a good game."

If you're up to the challenge, this is the game for you!!I remember this game FONDLY on the NES, and spending hours on what could inevitably only take two hours to complete. Just be aware that this is a thinking person's adventure. Is it frustrating? Yes, but that's what makes it special. Just be sure to grab as many torches that you can find and THINK!!! An absolute brilliant game for those who want to spend their time thinking of every meticulous possible avenue of completion. A very rewarding game if you have the patience. a lot of trial and error here, but the pay off is grand.10/10"

In fact, they more or less just add a pixelize filter. I think I speak for all of us when I say that classic style would work better if they just swapped out the art for something that looks more like the art from the NES title."

I like that it cahnges depending on the difficulty.  Not a fan of the time limiting curse.  I can deal with the torches and that's fine but all in all it's a great game.

For me, this was a bit of a nostalgic jaunt.This is a nice little remake of the original Shadowgate mystery/puzzle game and probably would be a good game for those who miss the Myst style of gaming experience as this game requires a logic, all too often all its own, to solve the numerous puzzles of which this game is comprised. The graphics consist of mostly still or partially animated pictures which you click on with a mouse pointer while using different menu options to modify the effect of your clicks (you can also use hotkeys on the keyboard). Unlike the first iteration of Shadowgate the creators of this game have attempted to make the game feel less arbitrary and frustrating. The inclusion of multiple difficulty levels helps decrease frustration and increase replayability also. Unfortunately, this game has only 2 possible endings. 1) You die somehow and 2) You defeat the dread warlock lord and live unhappily ever after (due to the presence of an advertisement for a sequel).+Good, relatively logical puzzles (so far as this type of game is concerned).+Adequate controls for such a point-and-click style of game.+Adequate writing.+Will heavily remind you of the original without being as frustrating as the original.+Multiple difficulty levels.+No bugs.+/-Mediocre sound with adequate voice acting.-Not a great sense of mystery for such a puzzle type game.-Mediocre (at best) graphics in a odd storyboard/storybook style.-Fairly sedate music which can become repetitive over time.-The ending is severely hampered by an advertisement for a sequel.-Fairly generic story.-Some obtuse puzzles may require you to read a game walkthrough to figure them out."

Most include me dying and seeing that laughing Grim Reaper. (Hey, I think he's laughing.)This is one of those remake games that gets it. They managed to navigate the challenging terrain between people who have played the original and expecting that nostagic bliss and those who are new, who have different expectations for games. It's different enough that it's still a challenge if you've played the game before, but not so different that it's unfamiliar.That is one hell of a hurdle to do and this game does it flawlessly.

I have very fond memories of the original and trying to work through the puzzles.  The team did an excellent job on revamping old puzzles/rooms, but keeping the familiarity of the old game present.   You're still dependent on torches and there is another timed situation you must deal with, both leading to doom if you fail to keep up in time.The dialogue was well written and comedic in some places.  The death logs always gave me a chuckle.If you're a fan of puzzle games or games which can be a little unforgiving then definitely give this one a chance.Not a great game if you need hand holding or are terrible at puzzles, you might want to move along.""

I enjoyed the old mac-adventures that were made years ago, and Shadowgate has always been a memorable one over the years. These games were difficult as **** but they always brought a unique feeling of mystery and adventure.This remake was a blast to play through. The harder difficulties are - difficult as **** and require a guide if you lack patience like me. I'm not the best at these games, but I enjoy them still. They inspire me to create my own adventures."

,Recommended,294440,28198781,"Posted: 4 December, 2016",all,General Brent,"I will start off by saying that Shadowgate(2014) was the main reason I even opened up a Steam account. I played Shadowgate on NES back in the mid-2000s decade, as I had never played it as a kid. As far as point and click adventures go, it's certainly one of the best ever, and this remake does not disappoint. The atmosphere, enhanced graphics, well told story, remixed music, different difficulty modes, and varied puzzles and paths make this one outshine the original version even. With various customization options, anyone who enjoys point and click adventure titles will feel right at home with Shadowgate.For the best experience during gameplay, I like to set the music to retro 8-bit style and play that way. That music when the torch is about to run out always puts me on edge, and heightens the foreboding mood that a game like this is supposed to have. Some of the puzzles are the same as the original- such as needing to grab a shield to block the dragon's flame in the treasure room- but others require slightly different approaches than the original game, especially on Master difficulty. If you don't use a walkthrough, it will take quite some time to get through the game. Beyond that, I am certainly not going to spoil anything, so try it and find out for yourself.Overall, I highly recommend Shadowgate(2014). It truly is one of the definitive point and click adventure games around."
