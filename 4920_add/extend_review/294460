,Recommended,294460,12235849,"Posted: 25 September, 2014",all,[Cash.net] Mr. Payday,"Fenix Rage brings back the fun of classic hardcore platformer action. It's mainly inspired by Super Meat Boy and most levels really have the same difficulty as you had in Super Meat Boy. If you are an old-skool gamer like me you will have lots of fun with this challenging game. Instead of raging I'm mostly smiling. Why? Because hardcore platformers almost aren't produced (anymore). Super Meat Boy has been a while back now, and after completing that it was really time for some new hardcore platformer to make me frustrated and give me a real challenge.The game has over 200 levels, each as frustrating as any and each level can be played in 3 different modes: normal, challenge and godmode. I am yet to figure out what godmode is, as I haven't unlocked that yet. Normal let's you play through the levels, well.. ""normally"", while challenge gives you even more of a challenge by limiting the dashes and jumps you can make per level. Besides that there's also one cookie in every level to collect to unlock (real-life!) recipes and there's hidden ""red cubes"" which you can collect to unlock a bonus world with hidden levels that give you even more of a challenge.There's 4 different themed worlds, each with their own unique (challenging and frustrating!) boss and after you beat the last one you unlock another 4 new themed worlds, which are inspired on the levels from the first 4 worlds, again with entirely new unique bosses. You could see the other 4 worlds as the ""dark world"" from Super Meat Boy, so to speak.The last 4 worlds will definitely give you the real challenge, and I've spent a couple of hours already trying to beat these. I am currently at 8 hours of playtime and only in world 5, so the game will give you atleast 20-25 hours of unique playtime, so it's really worth the money!After you beat everything you can collect yellow stars, by completing each level within the timelimit that the developers set for each level. These yellow stars can be spent in the ""arcade shop"" where you can buy about 10 unique minigames and where you can try to get into the highscores, which are shared online through Steam. The best times of each level can also be seen on online leaderboards. Then there's also a lot of achievements to collect, including hidden ones, so this will surely keep you busy for a while! :)The graphics are also unique and stylish and the soundtrack is sweet and gets you pumped, although perhaps they could have used more varying tracks for different worlds.I would give this game a 9/10. I would say regularly update the game with new levels or perhaps add a level editor with the ability to share your levels and worlds online to make this a perfect game. I would also love to see more of the ""Fenix Box"" levels, which look very classic (I believe from early in-dev times).Other than that, retro hardcore platformer, surely recommended, especially for this price! Developers are also very nicely in touch with the community and are actively listening to your feedback. :)"

The response to the controls felt really good, and I could command great control of the character. The game starts out leading you to believe ""okay, this isn't going to be THAT hard...."" ..... but after only a few levels in, you realize what you are in for. Flying chaos involving jumping, dashing, fire, and ice.I keep seeing reviews comparing this to Super Meat Boy, which I have also played. I liked SMB as well, but this game does have an altogether different feel to it, which I like. I have a few hours in and have barely scratched the surface and look forward to playing more!Oh, and one more thing. The music is pretty ridiculously awesome as well."
,Recommended,294460,12227052,"Posted: 24 September, 2014",all,Denbowski,"Fenix Rage is clearly influenced by Super Meat Boy. Different from SMB is the ability to dash, providing the gamer a reward of finishing a level more quickly at the risk of not having as much control over Fenix. The gameplay is flawless. It is truly the gamer's fault for dying -- which you will, a lot -- and not the game getting in the way of itself.The only negative thing I can say about this game is that my hand became tired while playing the first boss level as I was frantically trying to dash and jump my way through the level. At the time of this review I have played through the entire first world obtaining all the cookies in those first 20 levels.I would consider this a must play if you enjoy the highly difficult yet satisfying platforming games."
76561198004885007,Not Recommended,294460,13887475,"Posted: 7 January, 2015",all,AxemJinx,"This is more a mixed review than a negative one.I purchased Fenix Rage because the experience seemed similar to Super Meat Boy, but two factors have depleted my motivation to continue. (I'm currently in the middle of World 5.)There is a distinct lack of enemy variety. Predominantly, all you'll see are enemies that move back and forth in a straight line, or that jump in place, which is nearly the same thing. It isn't until you've completed around 80 levels that you'll see enemies with different movement patterns, and by that point I had already grown tired of the level design. Even many of those later levels apparently focus on the straight-line enemies.Similarly, maneuvering Fenix often involves no more than button-mashing to take a straight line through openings in between the aforementioned enemies. In most cases, you'll either mash the jump button to ascend, or the dash button to move sideways. There are no precise wall kicks or nuanced, curved jumps, and Fenix's vertical speed feels rather slow. The idea of infinite jumps and air dashes sounded exciting, but ended up being more simplistic and repetitive than I expected.If neither point fazes you, and you seek another precision platformer, I'd say there's a good chance you'll enjoy this, even if it didn't quite meet my personal expectations. Otherwise, perhaps you'd be better off with another entry in the genre."

I have died too many times in the early stages that i felt should not be this hard. I'm recommending this game based on me doubting my skills and thinking that other players probably prefer harder games than I do. TLDR; cool and hard indie platformer game."

I wasnt even that fond of Super Meatboy, but I found this game very attractive and challenging. The main character looks really cool, too.  Reminds me of some of the older SNES character designs.  Definitely worth the $$$.  You will find yourself playing 'just one more level' far after you've wanted to stop."

I just finished the game and I put in about 9 hours into it. If you did not like Super Meat Boy you probably will not enjoy this game though. Fenix Rage has simple controls, great handling, lots of collectables that actually make you want to pick them up, and is just a blast to play. If you are looking for a challenge I definitely recommend this game. I want to make this clear. This is not a Super Meat Boy clone. It is it's own game and has it's own individual feel. It is well worth the price tag and once again I can't recommend this game enough."

,Recommended,294460,12496666,"Posted: 14 October, 2014",all,(+[__]::) Stovich,"Fenix Rage is an excellent purchase for fans of hardcore platformers.  If you like Super Meat Boy, IWBTG, Electronic Super Joy, or VVVVVV then you will no doubt enjoy this game.  The challenge-level is equivalent to SMB, however Fenix Rage presents enough new tricks and challenges to make this a unique game.As Fenix, you have an infinite number of air-jumps and air-dashes at your disposal for manuevering past enemies and traps.  The goal of all 200 levels is to simply reach the blue-block at the end.  Clever level design from beginning to end ensures that even seasoned platformer fans can expect a satisfyingly twitchy 9+ hours of gameplay to 100% the game."

76561197994686280,Recommended,294460,12394833,"Posted: 6 October, 2014",all,whatthetrash,"Fenix Rage is a fantastic platformer that's similar to (and very much inspired by) Super Meat Boy. While Super Meat Boy has momentum-based movement, Fenix Rage controls more like Donkey Kong Country (in that you stop moving immediately when you let go of the analog stick. Side Note: I prefer movement like this, but that's just personal preference). What's unique about Fenix Rage is that the main character has infinite jumps and dashes that you can use whenever you want.""But wait!"", you say. ""Doesn't that ruin the game?""Not at all. The levels are designed around this over-powered movement style. In fact, you will die - a lot. That's okay, though because the respwan is *instant* (which is FANTASTIC). It feels less like you're dying repeatedly and more like you're just learning the level and playing it until you beat it. The levels are actually not *that* difficult (I found myself flying through level after level), but an optional cookie that you can get in each level ups the challenge dramatically. I found getting the cookies super-rewarding and loved the added gameplay this provided.The art is charming and unique, the soundtrack rocks and is fun to listen to and the level design is great. The difficulty ramps up so gradually that near the end of the game you're doing straight-up ridiculous maneuvers to stay alive, but it never feels overwhelming. With over 200 levels - including arcade mode and secret warp zone levels - there's a lot of game here.Everything is not rainbows and unicorns, however. Some levels have enemies moving really fast in tight, confined spaces. Getting past these types of enemies felt more like luck than skill. The same goes for dashing through tiny 'one-block-high' holes in walls - that *always* felt like luck to me. Also, the little green squares (the main enemies in the game) are used *a lot*. Like, ""bordering-on-too-much a lot"". I honestly think they're used too much. I would have liked to have seen more variety in the gameplay. Different types of enemies, more patterns to evade and so on. With four Light worlds, four Dark worlds, a secret ninth world and warp zones there are a LOT of levels here. There's no reason to have a single mechanic (the dodging of square enemies) be used SO much. There are other mechanics in the game, though (I don't want to make it seem like that's all the game is). The variety of gameplay is good, but I would have liked to have seen more.TL;DR : Fenix Rage is a fast, frantic precision platformer that's a lot of fun. The controls feel fantastic. The level design is great except for a few places that feel 'cheap' (depending more on luck than skill). With tons of levels (over 200), exciting boss battles and lots of optional objectives, it's a game that you'll be playing for a while. An excellent game by Green Lava Studios and I look forward to whatever they're working on next. :)Final Verdict: 8.5 out of 10"

,Recommended,294460,12537295,"Posted: 18 October, 2014",all,R Dubs,"I played this game for the first time at PAX and was hooked almost instantly. The controls are incredibly responsive and the levels are almost always innovative.Fenix is as difficult as you want it to be. Just want to get to the end of each level? That's fine, touch the blue square and you've unlocked the next level. Want to finish it fast? Great, each level has a time to beat, and you get a gold star if you do. Want to finish it efficiently? Challenge mode limits the number of jumps and dashes you get to reach the end, and you'll get a red star. Are you a manifestation of pure, unbridled skill? Play Godmode like the god you are.Another review I read described it as a Super Meat Boy + Flappy Bird + Sonic the Hedgehog hybrid.. which is pretty accurate. For what it's worth, I'd say it's less grotesque than Super Meat Boy, far less repetitive than Flappy Bird (what isn't), and far more responsive than Sonic.Perhaps my favorite design feature in this game is that you respawn instantly after dying. I mean INSTANTLY. In Super Meat Boy, there's about 1/3 second of delay after you die, but in Fenix Rage, it's literally a few milliseconds before you can move again. Did you screw up during the stage? Push one button and BOOM instant respawn. It's amazing.From a pure gameplay perspective, Fenix wins. He just feels... powerful. However, the game could be more polished in its ambiance. The music is okay, but not as memorable as it is in VVVVVV or Dustforce. Dustforce actually creates an amazing ambiance with lush backgrounds, although that might just be my personal aesthetic preference.Lastly, this is just my personal gripe but none of these platformers ever has a real plot. They're always pretty half-baked, which is to be expected given the focus is on the gameplay, but still it would be nice to have say a choose your own adventure type deal with a good ending / bad ending / different levels depending on what you pick. But chances are good you don't care about that stuff anyway.8.5/10. Please buy this game so I can expect more great stuff from these devs :)"

Super meat boy lovers will probably love fenix rage as well.As challenging as it gets, the awesome soundtrack and well design difficulty curve will keep you going.The IL leaderboards are extremely fun to climb, it adds a lot of replay value.Content wise, the game doesn't lack. In each level there are 3 stars and one cookie to collect. This adds up to lots of runs per level (and deaths).I hope this game gets the attention it deserves."

76561198101453313,Recommended,294460,15790649,"Posted: 11 May, 2015",all,Mreitsma,"Fenix Rage has often been compared to Super Meat Boy. They're both very diffcult platformers. However, while Super Meat Boy features a single (or double if you play as certain characters) jump, in Fenix Rage, you can jump an infinite amount of times. You can also dash left or right an infinite amount of times. It's a very different experience, and I'd argue a better, albeit shorter one.The visuals are extremely impressive; much more so than Super Meat Boy. Menus pop, animations are fluid, and the game overall looks fantastic. It was very nice to look at after playing so many games that opt to take the 16 bit graphics route, which I despise. The cutscenes look great too. Yes, there is a story, but I'm not entirely sure what it is. However, games like this are rarely about the story, so this is easily forgiven.The game features many different things to do. The basic premise is to get from point A to point B, but there some twists to this. First, there is a cookie hidden in each level. If you find all of them in a world (20 levels, 20 cookies), you will unlock a cookie recipe. That's pretty neat. There are occasionally red boxes hidden in levels two; about 2 or 3 in a world. If you get to them in time, you'll unlock a level in a secret world, which automatically rewards you with a cookie if you complete it. There are also 3 different stars you can earn in each level. A yellow star can be earned for completing a level in a certain amount of time, a red star can be earned for completing a level by only using a certain number of dashes and jumps, and a blue star can be earned in a mode called ""God Mode."" In God Mode, you'll be invincible, and have to touch all of the enemies on the screen (thereby killing them) in a time limit.Yellow stars are decently hard to earn. I'm not really into speedrunning, so I only earned about 40 of them. However, yellow stars are also the most important. You can unlock minigames by spending yellow stars. Red stars and blue stars can't be used for anything, which is unfortunate, but not a huge deal. The minigames are... decent. If you're looking for a simple diversion when you're really, really bored, these will probably do. Otherwise, you'll probably only play them once.Red stars are the most fun to earn, in my opinion. Only being able to jump or dash a certain number of times adds a new challenge to the game. I had a good time earning all of them.I wasn't that excited about God Mode, though. I think I earned about 10 blue stars before I stopped wanting to earn any more. As said before, I'm not really into speedrunning, so the concept didn't really appeal to me very much in the first place, but they're also very hard; much, much harder to obtain than yellow stars. I've A+'d all of the light world (and many of the Dark World) levels in Super Meat Boy, but many of the levels in Fenix Rage are ridiculously hard to earn a blue star in. If you like to speedrun games, you'll probably like it more than I did, but it wasn't for me.There are 10 worlds in total, with 20 levels in each. You can't earn stars in the secret world levels, so that leaves 180 levels that you can beat in 3 different ways. 4, if you count beating it normally. While I've only put about 13 hours into it, they were very enjoyable. I highly reccomend this game."

,Not Recommended,294460,30570868,Posted: 17 March,all,RaZman,"I've played less than an hour of this game and I think I'm done. I love the artwork, music and concept. The levels follow a certain rythm that really allows you to blast through them once you sync up with the game. What bothers me is that while you can control your movement speed up, left, righ (infinite jump and dash) you don't have a way to control your falls. The majority of all my deaths in the game comes from the slow fall offsetting the entire mechanics of the game.Would have pushed through this fault if it wasn't making the first boss unbeatable (with the ""cookie"") because it takes five hours to fall through his vertical maze."

""Memorization"" is more ...PRECISE HURR DURR. This game does have unfathomable ""record times"" set by the staff.  I presume they set these times with the levels having no enemies on-screen.  Something to just Youtube to get over these so-called ""challenges""; Y'know, like every gamer does these days.  There should be a ""use caution"" button because I wouldn't want to spend $15 on this wanna-be retro Flash game (sorry, it is what it is.)It's simple and somewhat fun.  But Fenix being all floaty when you need to move fast and be PRECISE is detrimental to the whole core of the game.  The reason I say this is, the levels are pretty much vertically designed.  His jump is floaty, and the fall is slow.  So, in closing, trying to beat any of the outrageous record times with bullethell-level amount of enemies on-screen is just dog♥♥♥♥♥♥ So I'll just go through and just beat all the levels and not care about the times..."
