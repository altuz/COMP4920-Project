,Recommended,294530,10039285,"Posted: 6 May, 2014",all,Sunnycide,"A modern classic, Freddi Fish 2: The Case of the Haunted Schoolhouse is a clever (albeit blatant) satire on the McCarthyism era in United States history. Although I found it to be quite monotonous in storytelling, the character development and dialogue was some of the best we've seen this decade. If you're looking for a real work of art, Freddi Fish 2: The Case of the Haunted Schoolhouse is for you."

Few games have dared to stray into the territory that Freddi Fish 2: The Case of the Haunted Schoolhouse does. It was revolutionary in its time for its allegory of the Book of Job from the Bible. Along with Put-Put, Freddi Fish will always have a prominent place in the halls of American literature."

If you're an adult and have never played this game, it's almost certainly not going to do anything for ya, and ya should probably pass on it.This game and any other Humongous Entertainment game should only be bought for one of two reasons:1) You're getting it as a game for your young kids. That's how I was introduced to this game and it's stuck with me ever since. Freddi Fish, Pajama Sam, Spy Fox, Putt-Putt, they're all nostalgia mascots for my childhood and even playing this game now I still love these characters; as cheesy as they all may be now.2) You're like me and are reliving your childhood games. Trust me, even though this game is easy as hell and you can blast through it in under an hour, it's still fun to relive a game that you enjoyed as a kid.I spent a ton of the time I was on this game just screwin' around with the environmental stuff, which is half the fun of these old HE games. The story's stupid and would make Scooby Doo hang his head in shame of how laughable this ""mystery"" is, but it's still entertaining as hell to play through just so you can swim around the ocean, meet all of the Freddis' pals, and just see what you can do."

,Recommended,294530,13199640,"Posted: 2 December, 2014",all,RPINerd,"During the late 90’s/early 2000’s Humongous Entertainment released an absolutely fantastic stream of “edutainment” point and click adventures for children. These titles focus on a range of light academics including basic geography, basic to upper elementary level mathematics, logical thinking, critical thinking and puzzle solving, topped off with reinforcement of good manners and polite social etiquette. At the lower end of the age spectrum, they may require some adult supervision and supportive guidance, but there is no better series of games for a child’s first venture into PC gaming.I played the Haunted Schoolhouse right after finishing the Kelp Seed adventure and I remember not being okay with the whole “Haunted” part. Between the already scary sharks, and then some sort of paranormal activity in an elementary school, I remember that this game really frightened me at first. I think it was almost a year before I went back and actually really enjoyed it. It is by no means inappropriate, but I would recommend some supervision at first until you see how your child reacts to some of the opening scenes and concepts."

I cannot state enough how impactful this game is to the gaming communtiy and I feel it is my oblogation to convey this simple message. Freddi Fish 2: The Case of the Haunted Schoolhouse is a refreshing take on the childrens click entertainment platformer series. It's endless innovations are awe inspiring.

Like in Freddi Fish 1; we’re drawn into a struggle between several groups competing to solve the mystery, and deciding which of their imperfect post-spook philosophies to align with made me pause to consider how I wanted events to play out. Even the highly questionable Institute has a tempting reason to side with them, and turning away from them in my playthrough wasn’t as clear-cut a choice as I’d expected. I was impressed by the sympathy shown toward the schoolmates, too - even the most irredeemable murderer is explored and given a trace of humanity."

,Not Recommended,294530,24715234,"Posted: 4 August, 2016",all,Double Uppercut,"Did you know that when I first attempted to play this game as a child, I was too scared to play it because of the ghost character?I bet you didn't, you smug sons of b****es.Freddi Fish 2 is the continuation of the rich world of the titular character and his psychologically complex detective fish friend, Luther. While they are attending school one day, a mob from the Squidfather hits up the school, stealing supplies from it and frightening childrend, while disguised as a ghost. So Freddi and Luther must follow a trail deep into the bowels of Hell itself in order to uncover the dastardly truth of this sinister plot.I might be making fun of the game, but to be completely fair, I did enjoy it far more than the original Freddi Fish.The game centers around you catching the alleged ghost haunting the school by getting supplies for a trap. It seems a little a**-backwards, since Freddi and Luther have no literal idea when the ghost might come back, even if it does. I think their efforts would have been better spent actually tracking down the ghost. Hell, I even tried to at first but the b****** just up and disappeared after I chased him for a bit.While you hunt down these various items, you get to explore are far more enjoyable and colorful world, and while the characters don't exactly fit in it like the last installment, it still looks more friendly than the ominous backgrounds of Missing Kelp Seeds. I was actually surprised with how much there is to do in the world this time around as well. Many characters will break into song (most of them not that great), there's a Space Invaders minigame (which is watered down, but still fun... no pun intended), and even movies you can watch (all of which center on dumb puns, not unlike my last pun).While I can say that just throwing more sh** into a game doesn't make it better (A lesson that could be sorely learned by the Call of Duty franchise), it'll give the little snots a little something extra if they ever play this game. Which I assumed they won't. The only people that do these days are greasy f***s that are far too old to be playing a kids game.Like... me...A final point that I'd like to make, is that for this being a ""Case of a Haunted Schoolhouse"", there isn't a lot of mystery to it. All you're doing is collecting items for the trap. I mean, it is obvious to anyone who's older than 5 to tell that the ghost is f***ing fake, but the game goes out of its way to explain who the ghost really is before you even get a chance to start suspecting the various characters in the game world. And it's the same two damn punks from Missing Kelp Seeds and that cliche pun on The Godfather. When I saw those two tumors appear on screen again, I just sighed and rested my hand on my forehead, and promised myself it'll all be over soon.Luckily enough, it was. This game, while larger than Freddi Fish Uno, is still pretty easy on the run-time, but also low on the relpy value. It definitely fits into most of the Humongous game tropes, with gathering items, talking to zany characters, and playing minigames along the way... but it all feels disconnected in the large world. It doesn't feel as creative as Humongous' later efforts to make fun kids games like Pajama Sam or Spy Fox 3. But it's still and improvement from the first game, and that's definitely a plus in my book. For all that, I'm giving Freddi Fish 2: The Case of the Haunted Schoolhouse a 5/10."
