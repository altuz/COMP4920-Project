I started playing these at about five and now at eighteen me and my twenty five year old sister went back and bought all of the Freddi Fish games. If you're like me and grew up with them then you alrady know that these are the best kids games around to date. They taught problem solving skills and good morals without ever making it seem like work. All the games share a common lay out and a cast of memorable characters that children can really get into. I not only highly recomend these but also highly recomend the entire Humongous Entertainment collection. It's nostalgia at its best for us ""older kids"" and it's good clean fun for young children that will keep them comming back for hours on end.P.S. all the Humongous Enternainment package games sport at least two different versions of their stories, one common one and one rare one. It just makes them even more fun...that and the fact that you can quite literally click on anything for a funny result."

,Recommended,294540,13199646,"Posted: 2 December, 2014",all,RPINerd,"During the late 90’s/early 2000’s Humongous Entertainment released an absolutely fantastic stream of “edutainment” point and click adventures for children. These titles focus on a range of light academics including basic geography, basic to upper elementary level mathematics, logical thinking, critical thinking and puzzle solving, topped off with reinforcement of good manners and polite social etiquette. At the lower end of the age spectrum, they may require some adult supervision and supportive guidance, but there is no better series of games for a child’s first venture into PC gaming.I remember almost nothing about Freddi Fish 3; upon replaying it, some snippets here and there came back to me, but there were also locations that I swear I never saw. From my experience over a decade later, I think The Case of the Stolen Conch Shell is a great entry in the Freddi Fish franchise, but your child's engagement may vary depending on their personal interests. To it’s credit, the solving of a mystery is a great way to develop logical thinking, deductive reasoning and to a strangely competent extent, the ability to read emotional and behavioral clues. Buy the Case of the Missing Kelp Seeds first and if that goes well, consider picking up Freddi Fish 3."

,Recommended,294540,13800556,"Posted: 2 January, 2015",all,Ness,"I REALLY have no ♥♥♥♥ing idea why I decided to go through with playing this game, I guess just for the little bit of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ humor I get from playing a game meant for kids about a decade or so younger than me. Let me tell you about Freddi Fish 3.It's not a bad game for kids. It really is not, but there are still defining flaws, some of them are issues with the entire franchise I've found.On the positive side we have that this game allows for a lot of exploration, but not too much, just enough that a child can wrap his/her mind around the environment, which you have to do to gather up the dirt on the suspects so that you'll know who stole the golden pipes at the end. It's a fun little meander through a bouncy, colorful aquatic environement, and while I feel the pixelly graphics look and feel very dated; I didn't mind it one bit playing this game as a kid.On the negative side we have... well the gameplay. At times doing the stupid chores that this game throws out gets horribly dull, especially when you figure out it leads to nothing but a minigame or nothing but an extra feature. (I'm looking at you, Carnival.) Although I might be thinking too adult here, as I do know Children can be very easily distracted but still very entertained by extra features and minigames, but I myself, even as a child got a little peeved when I found out doing work was for naught.All in all, it's a neat little game, a little short, a little dull and a little dated, but it's not bad. It has extra features like the minigame, the organ that makes cow sounds and watching Luther go through ""The Terrific Tumble Tubes"" that make the game feel a bit more lively. It's still not a perfect kid's game, but it's okay, I enjoyed it as a kid, I just don't think I'd play it again."

Like most HE games, it has a random selection of puzzles (and you can tell right off the bat whether or not the next screen in the game will have one of the lost MacGuffins)....For some reason, certain sea critters are considered inferior, with some animals even being used as currency. As you play through the game, you will witness a shark biting into someone again and again, because you're trading that person and their family for a mirror. Does the book on the first screen have a picture of Earth on it? I hope you're prepared to find a prison containing many slaves that you will then return to their randomly-selected master, in exchange for getting to keep one to give to a bird that will probably eat them alive."

,Not Recommended,294540,24727447,"Posted: 5 August, 2016",all,Double Uppercut,"Now, we're getting back to some familiar territory in the Freddi Fish series. I only played Missing Kelp Seeds once, and barely touched Haunted Schoolhouse until I actually saw the ghost. But Freddi Fish 3: The Case of the Stolen Conch Shell and I have a personal nostalgic connection.So, like all my other nostalgic ties, let's take this one and burn it to the f***ing ground.I will be honest, this is probably the best Freddi Fish game money can buy... I mean, unless you spend an a**load of money developing an unofficial Freddi Fish 6 that's so damn good, it would even be considered by Yahtzee Croshaw to be the best game of 2025.The reason I enjoyed Freddi Fish Tres so much more than the last two entries was the environment. It's no secret that Freddi Fish 1 had a creepy world that the oddly-cartoonish creatures stuck out like sore thumbs in. And while Freddi Fish 2 was a step in the right direction, the actual environment and fish didn't mesh well. But Freddi Fish 3 has probably the best-matched backgrounds to fit these cartoony fish characters. It's bright, cheerful, and colorful almost everywhere (barring the downed plane and red chasm where the bully-crab kid lives). But the tropical island really fits in with a cheerful kid-friendly color palette of Freddi Fish.I also like how this is the first entry where those two incredibly thick sharks and their mob-boss, The Squidfather, have been reduced to ""Wanted"" posters in a jail cell. I hated those three so much. Now, the actual mystery is concealed until the very end. It's up to you and your wits to determine who the thief of the Conch Shell is.However, where my praise ends is where the gameplay focuses on you finding three golden horns for the conch shell, so that way Luther's uncle's dog, Salty, can sniff out the perpetrator (even though he could just as easily find a trace with one, but whatever). The actual ""crime solving"" comes down to the very ending where you find a vital clue that fits into these Usual Suspect types, and you can achieve 1 of 6 endings. The gameplay itself only shifts when you have to find the various golden horns. The 6 endings are totally random. In my 1.2 hours of gameplay, I played about 5 times, but only got 3 of the possible endings. So if you have enough patience, or you're a toddler, you'll have plenty of time on your hands until you get all the different endings.This particular Freddi Fish, while probably the best in the series thus far, is still far from earning a recommendation from me. ""Why?"" you must be asking. ""Is this guy just a d***?""No, you silly s**. Just look at my other Humongous reviews. The only three games I consider worth playing to anyone who likes good game design and clever jokes are Pajama Sam 1 & 3, and Spy Fox 3, because of their truly unique style, fun characters, and memorable little stories. Freddi Fish still feels like it's made towards the obviously younger demographic of children than Pajama Sam and Spy Fox are. It feels too safe. Too friendly. But it's, by no means, a bad game. It's worth playing if what I described earlier sounds fun to you. And I'm giving this Freddi Fish entry a 6/10."

It just felt slower and not as clear what there was to do.  Maybe it was just the certain combination of locations I had to find the items in.

There's certainly a nostalgic value here, however, it's not by any means as good as you remember it. The writing is very plain and dialogue is delivered very slowly and overly well-annunciated; the polar opposite of Pajama Sam's witty pop culture references and smoothly-delivered dialogue. The puzzles in these kinds of games have never been challenging, but in FF3 they're very limited. It can only be assumed that this game was intended for a much younger audience.To sum it up, don't buy this unless you played it as a kid, and even then don't expect the sugar-coated memories to make this any better. Except for the cop fish that eats donuts."

Someone stole the conch shell AND the crowd blamed an innocent person for it enough to where they send that innocent person to jail- The backgrounds are nice to look at- Freddi and Luther still have excellent banter, and the characters have interesting things to say--> Except Horse Fetters. It's awesome to blame him every game while he counters with suspicious sounding gibberish :)CONS- It's easy/fast to go through all the branching paths- The temple sequence, which is always the same except for getting a different colored crystal...Always tedious to go through that- The minigame where you match four sea animals together for an extended amount of time; not only does it take forever, it's incredibly easy and I usually exit out of playthroughs where I have to do that minigame- Freddi still comes off as condescending to Luther, but not as much as other games I've played...This could be a pro depending on your personality but sometimes Freddi is a little too self-righteous for my tastes. She'll look at me when Luther does something wrong, as if I should chastise him too. Well, sometimes, we all just want to reach for shiny jewels, Freddi. Accept human/aquariam nature- Horse Fetters isn't always the culprit :(- The price is way too highThis is my favorite of the Freddi Fish games. I love that there are so many culprits and they all have different motivations for stealing the conch shell. It's definitely too expensive for what it offers, but I got these on sale for about $2-3, so I suggest waiting for them to go on sale again. I feel like the different playthroughs are interesting in how you get different golden pipes for the conch shell, so if you're the kind of person who likes playing well-thought-out children's games, I definitely recommend this as I feel like the game doesn't automatically assume you're a child, especially given the ending sequences for each of the culprits.If you ever feel like you want to solve a mystery that doesn't require too much thought, play this. It's a different culprit every time and as far as children's games go, it still reigns supreme in my book. Freddi Fish and Luther still got nothing on the Pajama Sam universe, though."
