,Recommended,294570,14657210,"Posted: 25 February, 2015",all,SpeedySnail,"The Freddi fish series is one of the most critically acclaimed, and greatest series of all time. Freddi Fish 5: The Case of the Creature of Coral Cover, being the most acclaimed game in the series. The graphics, artwork, music, voice acting, plot and more are all perfect, they are better than freddi fish 3! How can you perfect perfection? Freddi fish 5 does just this! I would not recomend buying this game first as it will BLOW YOU OUT OF THE WATER (Hilarious freddi fish reference/general ocean joke) And make the other masterpiece freddi fish games look pale in comparison. However, if you simply want the best of the best, buy this game. The replayibility is great and for 6$ it is a HUGE STEAL. This game is chocked up full of humor, tragedy, suspense, horror, mystery, and MORE! what more could you ask for? The only thing lacking is Multiplayer but that is no issue as the characters almost feel life-life, they became your best friends from the get-go. Freddi and luther have been some of my best pals since I was a child, I feel happy to support such a great game, hopefully you do the same.-SpeedySnail"

,Recommended,294570,29552123,Posted: 28 January,all,LuluCalliope,"When I was a little girl, my brother and I had four Freddi Fish games: the first three and the last one. We completed the first three games countless times...but we never completed the fifth one. We spent hours trying to complete it. Eventually, our father looked at the game and concluded that it was ""too buggy"" and couldn't be completed. So...that was that. When I purchased the Freddi Fish series on Steam, I thought of my five-year-old self and decided to complete the game that Past Me never could...for old time's sake, I invited my Dad to sit down with me to watch the game. We had a nostalgic blast as we experienced the corny charm of Freddi Fish. And I am pleased to say that after over fifteen years...I finally completed Freddi Fish. Ha ha!The game is great for people who grew up with Freddi Fish and for people who want to develop their problem-solving skills. I strongly recommend this game if you're a fan of Freddi and/or if you're looking for a cute, entertaining game for children."

,Recommended,294570,34184852,Posted: 11 August,all,nujumkey,"My childhood <3All of these Freddi Fush and other Humongous Entertainment are fantastic. All of their point and click adventures have great animation and large creative worlds to explore. You are Freddi Fish and your pal is Luther; your goal is to figure out why a sea monster is terrorizing coral cove park. You do this by pointing and clicking objects to solve puzzles and interact with characters until you gather enough information to solve the mystery.I find there's a lot more visual humor than verbal in this Freddi Fish game; a lot of the jokes are told through pictures and character actions than said outloud. The puzzles themselves in this game seem simpler than in previous Humongous Entertainment games, a lot more straigthforward A to B puzzles where you have a very obvious keyhole and your goal is to find a key. While for me this made the game slightly less engaging, i found it made this freddi fish to be the best to introduce the series with. While the puzzles are simple, the world is still quite complicated. There's a lot of fun and quirky characters to meet, all well voice acted and offer some sort of interaction towards helping you save the day.If you ever want to show a friend a great old school point and click, this is a good starting point."

,Not Recommended,294570,28337573,"Posted: 12 December, 2016",all,Double Uppercut,"Another Humongous Entertainment franchise done and done with. And I finished both in the same day!But... yeah, I think as a whole, Freddi Fish just isn't a great series of games. Not when compared to Spy Fox and Pajama Sam. The series keeps suggesting this whole ""mystery-detective"" angle to the Humongous formula, but never really delivers (save partially for Freddi Fish 3, which I can now say is the best of the series).However, I'd say Freddi Fish 5 is a great contender for second-best Freddi Fish game!What a wonderful title.Freddi Fish 5 follows Freddi and Luther on, yet again, another big mystery to be had. There's a sea monster roaming around Coral Park and the detective duo are out to find out just what is going on at the park. And you know what? I think for once, Humongous understood how to make an actual mystery out of their story. It isn't the best attempt like Freddi Fish 3's but it's still good enough. The story takes some slightly interesting twists and turns with its development, and I was left wondering what was going on.But, the biggest problem with this story is that you know who it'll be everytime. The culprit and explanation for the crime is the same each time. You can argue that this is better writing as opposed to Freddi Fish 3, where it's just a random clue and random culprit every time and even THAT can be predictable after a while, too, but I still prefer 3 to 5 in that regard personally.The story does have a lot of cheesey and convenient moments. The dialogue and writing aren't as atrocious as Freddi Fish 4 (and not as many weird glitches, to boot), but there are plenty of moments that made me raise my eyebrow and wonder why the hell the characters in the story would do certain things. Especially on the Sea Monster and main villain's actions in the story.However, the aesthetic design and music are probably at their best here, specifically the music being the biggest update. Infogrames got to handle this project and their excellent control on sound design in the Spy Fox series really translates well to Freddi Fish (it might be why there was an improvement in writing, too). And the world is actually colorful and enjoyable to explore. I wouldn't say it's as beautiful as the massive locations you enter in Freddi Fish 3, but it's still well lit and well-colored.Beyond that, Freddi Fish 5 concludes the kinda drab series with a pretty decent send-off. Will 1, 2, and 4 are absolute cattle fodder in my opinion, Freddi Fish 3 and 5 are the two slightly better games in the series. Not perfect, by any stretch, but simple fun for you to waste an afternoon with. Hell, I bet you could play all 5 games in a day if you had the gumption to. And I'm giving Freddi Fish 5 a fitting 5/10."

The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!Can you survive five nights at Freddy's?"

As an adult, the gameplay still holds up and is still a fun point and click adventure game. Although I managed to beat it in less than 2 hours, it's still nice to be able to play it again. For a kid growing up today, this would make an excellent introductory PC game for them to play; after all, it is both fun and educational."

This game was a lovely part of my childhood and it's great to be able to re-play it on Steam. What I loved about these kinds of games is how the story occasionally changes so the objectives are different, although the outcome is always the same, but that's the thing that made me keep playing this game. Such a fun computer game back in the day and still is."

Multiple ending and gobs of things to interact with add to the replayability of the Freddi Fish games. It has helped my daughter learn to use a mouse so that's a bonus.I have had problems getting the resolution set correctly on our laptop but there is a workaround available for that issue.Recommended for kids.
