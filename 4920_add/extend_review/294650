With an amazing cast of full voice acted NPCs, you and your friends will be repeating the snappy one-liners like""Buckle your seatbelt Putt-Putt, you’re going for a ride!""for years to come.10/10, the Citizen Kane of video games."
,Recommended,294650,13199622,"Posted: 2 December, 2014",all,RPINerd,"During the late 90’s/early 2000’s Humongous Entertainment released an absolutely fantastic stream of “edutainment” point and click adventures for children. These titles focus on a range of light academics including basic geography, basic to upper elementary level mathematics, logical thinking, critical thinking and puzzle solving, topped off with reinforcement of good manners and polite social etiquette. At the lower end of the age spectrum, they may require some adult supervision and supportive guidance, but there is no better series of games for a child’s first venture into PC gaming.Putt-Putt Goes to the Moon is the nearest and dearest to my heart in the Humongous Entertainment lineup. I spent way too many hours as a child exploring the moon and helping Rover get home again and again. I think a lot of my infatuation with it can be credited to my strong interest in astronomy as a child, but Putt-Putt Goes to the Moon is still a masterful game and I cannot wait to share it with my children some day."

I mostly recommend buying this game if you played it when you were younger and want to have a nostalgia trip or if you are a parent with a young kid.

When I was released from the privilege mines, I had to learn all the new things ""the dating crowd"" was trying. I knew about scented CIS skulls and gluten-free cardboard, and sure was glad to hear people still use them. But I had no idea that ""video games"" were so popular with the ""romantics"" out there. All it took was one stroll through the Steam Store to prove I had to learn a new thing.""Where to start?"", I wondered. I wanted something simple. However, all I saw in the store was console ports that were covered with $19.99 DLC and extreme arson, or designed to somehow ""heat"" your NVIDIA card. No way, Jose! (I experienced the ""heat"" thing personally once after an adventurous incident with an XBox. I'll stick with ""room temperature"" from now on, thank you very much.)Luckily, I found a plain, old-fashioned video game that would not make me empty my pockets into the deepest bowels of Gaben himself. And it came in this HUGE bundle! No more awkward late-night Baal runs for me, once I could get my hands on this game. Now, I admit the graphics are not all that good. But after selling the ol' PS Vita and borrowing some cash from Aunt Irma, I was ready to ""checkout"".The product only took a week to download, and got to my computer just in time for my first real ""date"" since the Chex Quest incident. You can bet I was nervous for this one. When I got off the bus to meet Kojima in front of the Gamestop, I just about had a heart attack! The only thing keeping me calm was knowing that I could not possibly run out of video games that night. I gave Kojima a reassuring nod and smile, as if to say ""Don't worry, Kojima, I have plenty of vidya for later.""The dinner was great, and after knocking back a couple glasses of alka seltzer, we were ready to head back to my apartment. I winked and told Kojima, ""Let's ABANDON THIS THREAD,"" to see if she understood the gaming lingo. I think she did. Throughout the bus ride back, I grinned and hummed Gone Home tunes to set the mood.When we got to my place, I already had a song playing. It was by ""Protomen"", which I think you pronounce like Protozoa, because it is an exotic unicellular eukaryotic organisms that sounds just like real fedoras. After we got comfortable, I asked Kojima if she could help me with the video games. She looked at me weird, and I couldn't tell if it was because she thought it was ""too soon"" or because I was vigorously wiggling my eyebrows just like my hero Putt-Putt.So I ""took the initiative"", as women like men to do, and rolled my computer out. ""Ready to pay your respects?"" I joked, and by ""pay your respects"" I meant ""watch me pretend to be a car."" She looked at me all shocked, and said ""That's it, I'm out of here!"" I asked why, since she didn't need to run to Gamestop for any games - there was plenty right here. But she didn't answer, and got up to leave anyway. Then, as Kojima was about to pass me and the computer, she tripped on my dog Pep and activated my trap card! The force of my Mirror Force card knocked over my computer and ripped apart my Mountain Dew collection, sending 20 gallons of carbonated soft drink across my faux-hardwood floors.Kojima was completely drenched, and her momentum slid her to the front door - which she somehow managed to pry open with a pair of 2-litre Mountain Dew bottles. The last thing I knew, ""No-Fun Kojima"" was screaming profanities and sliding down three flights of steps. I didn't pay much attention because I was too busy trying to check my privilege. I managed to get about half of it checked - the other half probably offended tumblr. I never bothered to ask if she appreciated the free gift of Mountain Dew.Anyway, despite my ""user error"", I was quite pleased with the product. These days it's hard to find such a classic game, and you can find it right here at a discount price! I have to say I can't give this product a perfect review, because I can't figure out what I'm supposed to do at the rocket station. I've tried making millions of rockets but they all just sort of peter out and explode half-way. Aside from that artificial difficulty, I will definitely recommend this movie.9/10"

And really as being in the last group of people that used discs for PC gaming heres what I have to say about it.This was the very first putt putt game I ever played. I had a couple of them and pajama sam. I remember coming home from kindergarden and playing this whilst my grandmother finished up work. I remember always asking her for help but she always told me to figure it out myselff. Eventually I got used to problem solving by myself which I think was the point of putt-putt.When I was litlte I remembered spending weeks on one game. And I recently just beat it in an hour. So it's deffinitly on the shorter end.  But for 3 year olds I dont imagine thats much of a problem.Putt Putt games have always had this very polished sense and esspeiaclly after playing it on an HD monitor it looks even better being able to see every indivual picture. I've never really been a fan of the dashboard but I think its a very creative idea and wont say that I think it should'nt be there at all.The ""Story"" is a very simple on but honestly I dont expect much from a game for 3 year olds.Overall if you have 7$ and an hour to kill. Or maybe you want to introduce your children to video games from your childhood. Putt Putt goes to the moon is deffinitly a good start."

,Not Recommended,294650,31377111,Posted: 26 April,all,Double Uppercut,"I think there's an obvious progression in stakes for Putt Putt in these games Humongous made. We start off joining a parade and in the nexr game we LAND ON THE MOTHERF***ING MOON! It took Mario 9 installments till he made the leap to a game set in space.Putt Putt Goes to the Moon is about... Oh, f*** it. The plot is in the title. You've got Putt Putt. You've got the moon. Put the two together and bada-bing bada-boom, you've got Putt-Putt Goes to the Moon!Everything is set up like a Saturday morning early learning cartoon for young kids. Like, REALLY young kids. Much like Putt Putt Joins the Parade, the stakes are set incredibly low. I know, right!? How can being stuck on the moon and trying to get back to earth sound like it has low stakes?For one, the voice acting contributes to the underwhelming feeling of the circumstances. As soon as Putt Putt lands on the moon he very mildly exclaims, ""Oh my goodness... I'm on the moon."" where every vowel is sounded with forced enthusiasm. ""Time to go visit grandma... Yay...""The plot also does nothing to raise any of the stakes in the game. Sure on the radio, you hear about the cars back on earth who miss Putt Putt but there's no ticking clock. No possible threat of Putt Putt being stuck on the moon permanently. A moon rover shows him a rocket that needs parts (which only makes me wonder why the moon rover didn't fix the rocket himself back when he was stranded on the moon), and Putt Putt goes about getting these parts in such a mundane fashion that you'd think he just lands on the moon every other Sunday when there's nothing else for him to do.The tasks in which you get the rocket parts are also very uncreative and take no thought whatsoever to attain. The steering wheel is on a cliff and you'll automatically get it once you run into the moon rover again. All you have to do is put Pep on the ledge and he'll grab it. EXCITEMENT! Then to grab the nose-cone, you just have the give the Man in the Moon (Very educational, huh, Humongous?) a picture of the moon that the rover already gave you at the start of the game and then he'll just give you the cone. DRAMA! The moon crystals you win from two games of Whack-an-Alien. Yeah. That's it. ACTION! You get the key by going back to where you fell in some moon goop and save some other poor s** who slipped in (Only this time he fell in without the bridge breaking, so I wonder if he's just got poor judgment)...... Huh? What? Oh yeah! THRILLS!The final object poses a very slight challenge. You have to go to the right floor and apartment letter to find Robbie Rocket but in my game I just found two men who said he just left and went to a different apartment. One of them was incredibly buff and had his shirt off. I couldn't help but think that Robbie Rocket was in the ol' male pro******* game. No, shame man, no shame! I get it. The moon still holds onto those old conservative values but one day they'll come to accept your lifestyle. It just takes time and understanding. But, if you wanna sound less suspicious, might I suggest you change your name? Robbie Rocket is pretty... suggestive.Putt Putt Goes to the Moon is a bit more fun than that excapade with the parade but I can't help but feel underwhelmed yet again by this series of games. It's so bland, overly cheerful, and simplisticly easy that the 37 minutes I spent playing it were with some mild boredome. There are a few extra things you can do, but they're limited. And the tasks only vary on which male hoo*** is in which apartment to tell you where to find Robbie Rocket, and the type of key you need for the rocket to work. That's it.Like Putt Putt Joins the Parade, there's very little variation but the faster plot and slightly more fun moon premise give it just the smallest leg up on the previous game. Not a whole lot, though. It's no fun for anyone 8 and older. Hell, I'd say even 6 or older. But if you're looking for something distracting for your toddler, just slap this on your compuiter. The little bu***** will find some fun or challenge to it. As for me, I'm giving Put-Putt Goes to the Moon a 3/10. It's as boring and simple as the first game with just as few redeeming qualities."
