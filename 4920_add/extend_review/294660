Even though I am nearly an adult, I still enjoy and absolutely adore this game.Just as the name implies, the zoo is in trouble, and it is up to Putt-Putt, along with his pet dog Pep, to help out. From icy terrain to the heart of the jungle, Putt-Putt must save animals scattered throughout the field.One of my favorite things to do with each Putt-Putt game is that you can change the color. It's a little feature added to the series, but I always liked how you could paint this little fellow. (I always color him blue).Despite the dusty years, Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo, and all games for that matter, continues to shine. The memories left behind gives nostalgia a warm welcome."

Its nice to see that older games can come to sites like Steam in order to work on newer computers. This game is very low paced, which is great for smaller children. Its your typical 90's point-and-click game. Most objects that you click make funny actions and sounds. Its a unique feature that you dont see in many games now days. It gives you a smile. It really doesnt last that long, probably lasts about 1 hour at most, but its still somewhat fun. If you have the time,  want to get your child into gaming, or just in the mood to play a low paced game, heres a good game to play."

These titles focus on a range of light academics including basic geography, basic to upper elementary level mathematics, logical thinking, critical thinking and puzzle solving, topped off with reinforcement of good manners and polite social etiquette. At the lower end of the age spectrum, they may require some adult supervision and supportive guidance, but there is no better series of games for a child’s first venture into PC gaming.Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo is the pinnacle of the Putt-Putt Franchise. Between that absolutely brilliant opening theme and the best arctic exhibit in all of gaming, Saving the Zoo will forever hold the trophy for best Putt-Putt game of all time in my mind.

I looked through all the choices and saw most of my favorite Humongous titles, buying each one. However, much to my sadness, I did not see Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo, which happens to be my all-time favorite. Ever since that day, I periodically checked Steam to see if they'd ever put it up and sure enough, today, I saw it and instantly bought it! I couldn't be happier! The game still stands the test of time and is as great as I remembered it! The style, the voice acting, all the little stuff you can do and listen to... It's perfect. Thank you Humongous for bringing me so much joy as a kid AND an adult. I'm so glad I know the good that you did in the early 90s and I think it helped me and many others become better people.And thank you Steam for bringing these joyful, colorful games to your roster.

When Skeeter the snake told me about the glorious coils of the beyond, I knew I couldnt go back to the man I was. Anyone going into this experience has to know that it is an allegory for modern capitalism in american society. Mr. Baldini represents the man as he tries to suppress the inevitable and glorious proletarian revolution. Im also pretty sure he called me a racial slur. Once you get to the zoo, you are greeted by another ethnic stereotype as ""Outback Al"" orders you too return the animals he views as his property. This is doubtless a reference to Joseph Conrad's classic work Heart of Darkness, as Im like 90% sure hes a Belgian stereotype. The next pitfall of the borugeiosie scum is the food cart. I spent at least 50 minutes of my playthrough trying to solve the ""cheese squiggly"" puzzle. After that I met the monkies, who enjoy jazz and hanging out in trees. I tried using the rope to no avail. I dont want to spoil the entire game, so i'll only give you one last juicy tidbit of advice; To get the best ending, be sure to save the hippo instead of the snake. Only that way can you use his skin on the final boss. All in all, 4/10 it was ok I guess."

As a kid I used to spend hours replaying this, clicking on all of the things in the background. The simplicity of the game was just comforting and fun. And then there was the hockey mini-game. That was the bomb.After playing it one more time about 10 years later, I think that's all I needed. I just needed to remember a simpler time. I feel bad for returning it, but honestly, they publishers have already milked this 20+ year old game enough. Looking back on it, it has pretty bad voice acting at times, but otherwise it's just a point and click game for young kids and it fulfills that purpose.So purely for nostalgic reasons, I'm giving this game a solid 10 hot diggities out of 10 hot diggities."

This is definitely the kind of game that a parent and their child can play together, like what happened when I was growing up. I remember playing this game with my mom, along with the other Putt-Putt games and Pajama Sam titles.As a teaching tool, the only thing this game teaches is the art of basic problem solving. You won't learn maths or science from this, and it's not going to expand your vocabulary. What it WILL do for kids is help them learn to find solutions to problems; even if something seems hopeless at first, with a little bit of thinking you'll be done in no time.The game's laughably short: Even as someone who's a bit dumb in the face, I beat this game in about 40 minutes or so, and that was with exploring around a bunch, trying to remember all the things from as a kid. I'd imagine if you're in the game's target audience it'll last longer, but it's nothing too involved. It's still a fun experience, though. Even as I was just going around doing things, I had this big dumb smile on my face the entire time. It's nostalgic, really. I'm willing to bet that even now, this game would be able to entertain kids just as well as it did 20 years ago."
