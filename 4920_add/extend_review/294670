,Recommended,294670,13744422,"Posted: 31 December, 2014",all,Delta Papa Mike Sierra,"From visionary science fiction writer William Gibson in collaboration with suspense legend Stephen King, a pair made in heaven, bring you this unfinished story from the lost manuscripts of Philip K♥♥♥♥♥♥This is the tragic story of a young car, a dog, and a quest. A quest to fix time and save the almighty paper that has the power to rewrite history. I don’t want to give too much away but the story is quite a tearjerker and with more suspense than anything i've played in years. The gameplay is not dated at all, and the graphics look almost as good as the original crysis. The game keeps track of your choices and everything has an impact. The level design is spectacular, giving you many different ways to solve the many puzzles and encounters in the game. The cinematics are also stunning, clearly ahead of their time. The only real complaint I have is that sometimes it’s way to easy to be killed, Dark Souls really took some pointers from Putt Putt, other than that its quite an experience. I would not recommend this for those under 18 because of the dark themes and surprisingly lewd content and language. I’d also like to note that you must be a seasoned gamer to truly appreciate some of the mechanics and get the most out of your experience. All in all Putt Putt Travels Through Time is a justice to gamers everywhere, and deserves it’s place in the vaults of time."

Because it's a time-traveling game.) In all seriousness, it is quite fun to play again after 15 years.If you are a parent, I also recomend this game for your child. I can remember this being one of the first games I ever played, and it is by far the most memorable. There are a bunch of minigames, some with 50 levels. Even though the story is the same each time you replay the game, the gameplay is different and you have to do different things to progress. There is also always a ton of things to interact with in each setting.This is a great game, but I would suggest to buy when it's on sale. This game was made in '97,  so if you haven't played it yet, you can wait a couple months to the winter/summer sale."

Well, here you go!""Putt-Putt Travels Through Time"" is a wonderous journey where you continually screw up the space-time continuum because Putt-Putt is late for school and his dog never buckles his seat-belt. Throughout your journey, you meet a bunch of memorable characters and explore the different time zones (there's f*****g dinosaurs and cowboys and s**t!). In fact, the things you do in the past, present, and future change how the game is played.

The screen was also cut off a little near the bottom, and the mouse was incredibly twitchy to the point that it was near impossible to aim at anything small (like the nickel at the very beginning of the game).However, the lag issue wasn't there when I loaded the game up a second time right before writing this, and hitting ALT + ENTER to force the game into windowed mode solves both the screen sizing and mouse sensitivity problems.So, aside from those annoying little details, it's just the same as I remember it."

Btw, for those who launch this game and it's all full screen with high mouse sensitivty. There's two options you can do to fix this, on your Library right click the game, go to local game files, and you'll see the ScumVM emulator, add the game onto there, and go to it's settings and put it to ""Correct Aspect Ratio"". This will solve your problem however you'll now be playing it on the emulator so Steam will not be counting your playtime hours. Other way is to do alt+enter when starting the game, the game will go into windowed mode, for me it was on the left side for some reason not showing the full image but on the bottom corners of the screen I was able to adjust the size and it was fine but it's not full screen."
