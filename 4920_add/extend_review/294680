The plot is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing deep.  Putt putt lives in nazi-occupied Warsaw.  He works underground to try to encite rebellion among the simple-minded citizens who follow the government without question.  Putt putt decides to join a race to earn followers to his cause.  You have to avoid pedofiles, Benito Meusilini, and cannaballistic prisoners of a Soviet Gulag.  This is all done using the metaphor  of mentally ill cars who know nothing about the horrors of the world.YES/10"

Otherwise there are much better point and click games from Humongous Entertainment out there.Pajama Sam and Spy Fox have an all ages, Pixar kind of appeal to them whereas the Putt Putt games are clearly made for young children."

A note for SteamLink users which may apply to all games in this series, sound will not work through SteamLink if headphone jack is plugged in on PC."
,Recommended,294680,32168462,Posted: 3 June,all,kelseyr713,"The series is meant for kids, and I'm not a kid anymore, but I had fun playing this one. I played some of the series when I was little, and I bought the Humongous pack when it first came out. I'll get to all of them eventually.Putt-Putt Enters the Race was the one that took me the longest to finish so far at 80 minutes - there are definitely more puzzles here than in the earlier games, like Joins the Parade and Goes to the Moon. The animations are cute.Recommended for: nostalgic twenty-somethings and little kids."

,Recommended,294680,11097926,"Posted: 6 July, 2014",all,ConanHuynh,"This is my second favorite Putt-Putt game (Saves the Zoo is the first). However, I'm splitting hairs between my favorites.As Putt-Putt is playing with his pet dog, Pep, he receives a letter from Redline Rick - an invitation to compete in the Cartown 500. Excited, our little friend goes to the track, where Redline Rick tells him a few things are needed before he is allowed to enter the race. And so, we must help Putt-Putt collect the items to race.Man, so many good things stood out. There's too many to list, but I figured I name a few.-Probably what grabbed my attention the most was the soundtrack. I ardently feel the music in any game is a critical aspect to deliver, and this game did deliver. There was something about this game that stole my heart, and I loved every minute listening to nostalgic tunes.-Recycling. Not only is this game fun and education, this game is also teaching us a valuable lesson: and that is to help our planet in cleaner ways. Glass bottles are scattered throughout the journey. Collect enough to earn some coins. And with the coins, Putt-Putt can do two activities. (Explained in the next two thoughts).-One of my favorite things to do in the Putt-Putt world is the paint job. That's right. In every game, you can color Putt-Putt in a variety of colors, and this game is no different. (I always color him blue). One feature different in this game is that the dashboard is painted now. It's not much, but it makes a huge difference in my eyes.-The car wash is back. Remember the first game? One thing you could do included a car wash. Well, folks, it's back in style in this installment. I don't know why, but I always enjoyed scrubbing Putt-Putt with bubbles, washing the doors, drying the car as a child. I still do today.-Giving Putt-Putt a new coat of color as well as a clean bath is not part of the main storyline, but it is a nice addition to the game. It just goes to show how much effort was put forth in such a phenomenal game.-Next to the recycling machine, there's this game Putt-Putt encounters, where he must put toys back in the proper position. For some reason, I always loved this part. Now, it's been quite a number of years since I revisited this game, but when the scene played, I nearly jumped out of my seat with sheer joy. I'm practically an adult, and cleaning up toys still excites me.-Some characters make a reappearance! Outback Al, our Australian partner, makes a visit. Rover, the vehicle abandoned on the moon, also returns. Mr. Baldini, our Italian moustache pal, is back. And much, much more.-There's a theme that finally makes sense. Joining the parade, going to the moon, saving the zoo, and traveling through time all made for fun adventures, but entering the race is something that sounds like a car would actually do.-One of the coolest features happens when Putt-Putt finally acquires the required. I won't spoil too much. Let's just say there's a mini-game involved, a fun mini-game.I was five when this game sold on the shelves. Fifteen years later, I am still playing this game, and, to be honest, I may have had more fun now than I did when I first laid my hands on this game. Putt-Putt Enters the Race is a must-have in the Humongous Entertainment collection."
,Recommended,294680,13199604,"Posted: 2 December, 2014",all,RPINerd,"During the late 90’s/early 2000’s Humongous Entertainment released an absolutely fantastic stream of “edutainment” point and click adventures for children. These titles focus on a range of light academics including basic geography, basic to upper elementary level mathematics, logical thinking, critical thinking and puzzle solving, topped off with reinforcement of good manners and polite social etiquette. At the lower end of the age spectrum, they may require some adult supervision and supportive guidance, but there is no better series of games for a child’s first venture into PC gaming.Putt-Putt Enters The Race was the last children's “Edutainment” game I played. Since I was older, it didn’t engage me like the others did. At the same time, I feel like this was when the Putt-Putt titles began to slip in quality and originality. It’s still a worthy title of the Humongous label, but I would purchase the Parade, Moon, Zoo or Circus before this one."
,Recommended,294680,24145019,"Posted: 6 July, 2016",all,TheWhovian,Very entertaining game. Keep in mind that this game only takes about an hour an a half to complete the game. I'd say it was worth the $2.49 that i bought it for during the steam sale. Would highly reccomend this children's game.

As an adult, this game still is fun to play. The characters are a little corny, but very loveable and definitely entertaining. The goals were intended for a younger audience obviously, so it will be easy for adults. For kids, this would definitely encourage them to think and solve puzzles. For nostalgic reasons, it gets an A+ in my book."

,Recommended,294680,25830479,"Posted: 2 October, 2016",all,J2xp,"A very very great game. This feels like the spiritual successor to Putt-Putt Joins the Parade, as it is the only other Putt-Putt where you explore Cartown.  Cartown is a bright and lively environment full of fun and memorable characters. Also has a nice soundtrack. The puzzle solving aspect though not too challenging, also isn't too easy. The race at the end is a neat feat of engineering that they managed to do it within the SCUMM engine. Very solid Putt-Putt, though I prefer Travels Through Time, this one is also worth your time."
