With him being 2,I of course,have to help him quite a lot and that being said I think this is a really cute game for the 10 and under crowd. . .There are lots of activities to do in this game for older kids. Right now about all Elijah can do is the picture painting and he completely loves doing that. . . The older he gets,the more he will be able to play. . .I think I picked this one up for 39 cents and in my opinion I would have paid up to $3.99 for it,its well worth it.Some of the activities are checkers,painting,a memory type game,word finds and a game we call ""Dots"",where you have to make random lines on a grid of dots,in hopes of making boxes before your opponent does,the one with the most completed boxes by the end of the game,wins. . . And in all truth,I still play this game on paper with my 21 yr old daughter as it's a great strategy type game. . .I give this kiddie-activity game a solid 9/10 and I do recommend it. . .Happy Gaming Everyone. . . ."

76561198088380930,Recommended,294720,20368175,"Posted: 6 January, 2016",all,emasterslake,"Here is the first and only cross over game Humongous Entertainment ever made. It's also the only other game to star Fatty Bear who only had one game as oppose to Putt-Putt who starred in several games and a few spin-offs. Anyways this game immediately starts up in a mini game menu hosted by Fatty & Putt-Putt. No intro, plot, or goal for this game the only thing to do is just play any of the given games with either Fatty or Putt-Putt as the opponents. It's sorta like a predecessor to Pajama Sam's Games to Play on Any Day. And there isn't much else to say about the content of the game. I am surprised that Humongous Entertainment never made any other cross over games on their other games. It's common for them to have various characters making cameos in each others games but never a game where they actually speak to one or another. Putt-Putt would go on to star in a few more mini game theme spin off games like this one. While Fatty Bear sadly never got a shot at being in more games. Overrall this game is worth playing for die hard Humongous Game fans."
,Not Recommended,294720,35313777,Posted: 29 September,all,Verdantil,"Tags: Boards & CardsAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from LibraryTLDR: Dos minigames with dubious entertainment value. Leaves sidebar on fullscreen. Otherwise works as intended. Happy to own a license for archival purposes but would rather keep it out of my everyday permanent library.This was part of this company's effort to diversify their offer and move away from point&click adventure edutainment titles which I think they were excellent at. Instead they whip up just pure entertainment with no educational value, but featuring the same characters. As a result this title does not play to these dev's strong suit and has aged badly. I do not think I would want to play any of these, and I would probably prefer my kids play something a little more entertaining. In a pinch it might do if kids want it but it can stay in the library of discarded products and does not belong in my permanent library.About on par with flash games, they have been renamed and tweaked and are variations of classics like match 2 hidden pictures, tic-tac-toe, and whatnot. It has a wider selection of games than the pajama sam game but seems to have been made earlier and is much more pixelated. Not sure which one ends up on top and do not think it is worth figuring out."
