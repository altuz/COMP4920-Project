This game is broken and crashes without making it to the main menu.Edit: Due to negative comments, I must add that I am not the bad guy here. This game was NOT in early access. But I expected some flaws, as these simulator games are hit or miss on the quality. I purchased a finished game, I can't wait until its finished so I can write a proper review of my gameplay experience.Unfotunately for now, I cannot recommed anyone purchase this because I am not the only one having problems with the game crashing. When it is patched so I can play a few hours, I will edit my review.Edit 9/12/2014 The patch came out 8 days after release so here is my review- It's about what I expected when I purchased this title. Good graphics, probably the best feature of the game. There still are some bugs that need to be worked out. I am satisfied with the game for the price but you have to like simulator games. I am not changing the thumbs down because, at the time I purchased, there were no reviews. I posted this review because I use the review system to help me decide if I should purchase the game, and for all the other gamers that do the same, I was providing valuable information to help them as they have helped me.Edit 9/12/2014The patch was out yesterday and now the game will play. However, there are still game-breaking bugs and crashes.About 10 hours in, and this will be the 3rd time I have had to restart because of crashing during loading a saved game or a bug with the truck being empty but when I try to dump a container in it, it says the truck is full.Buy at your own risk."

As a QA analyst by profession I was truly disturbed by how unfinished this game truly was at release.  Mercifully I was not beset by the crashes many of the other users have been afflicted by, but the game itself was clearly rushed through QA if it was even tested at all.AI trucks not having cockpits, immediate resolution of AI routes, incorrect amounts fo profit returned from AI routes.. The list goes on and on.  I truly, personally gave up after attempting to dump in the landfill with the trash going under my truck preventing me from ever moving again. A gamebreaker if I've never seen one.Until this game is properly tested and patched do yourself a favor and stay away."

I love Simulations, was tenative on getting it until a patch was released, proves they care. So I bought it once the patch was released. Game play is unique, guess it would be for a game about garbage and recycling, little repeatative but most simulators are. Graphics are suprisingly good and the game play is fun if you like simulations. No complaints, I hope they add more maps not that I have finished the original but variety would be awesome. More trucks etc too but game plays smoooth, is rather fun to play, suprisingly addictive. :)Random events would also add a coolness factor to the game too, something to break up of the normal trash activities."

The guy takes forever to haul the garbage. This should not be listed as a simulation game because there is no simulation, not to mention the graphics sucks. I am a garbage man in NY and if i moved that slow i would fired so quick. You can't control the garbage man only the driver which sucks. No first person cam no moving the cam around just that horrible view. I did not have any problems with the game loading or working or anything it works perfectly fine for me just sucks.

,Recommended,294830,31693111,Posted: 11 May,all,Azghouls,"When I first set eyes on this game ‘Recycle – Garbage Truck Simulator’, I had absolutely no idea what I’m going up against. Yes, it’s a garbage truck simulator however what the heck do you do besides hauling garbage? So, I played the guessing game and my conclusion is not much – that is there’s no real replay value. However, it turns out that there’s plenty of things to do like hauling garbage with different types of garbage trucks (small / large / crane), manage your landfill with three vehicles being the crawler, truck and bulldozer and, of course playing the role of a garbage manager. So, to my surprise, it’s a decent game however the user-inference and a game crippling bug can make you toss this game into the tip (excuse the pun).Because there’s no real ending to this, you can literally go on forever however I cannot think any good reason why you want to do that. I used the achievements as a baseline so once completed, I deemed the game as ‘conquered’. That said, the game’s pacing is extremely slow with a bucket load of micro-management. I think what the developers was trying to aim is there’s a lot more to it than just collecting / dumping rubbish – there’s a whole network of systems to be concerned about.Whatever the case maybe, this game certainly tailored to the very niche market and granted, there’s plenty of busy work to do (especially when you need to manage a number of trucks). Plenty of lost opportunity here however it’s not a game to be totally written off as there’s a lot of evidence of love poured into this game. However, because the game is now regarded as ‘abandoned’, meaning there won’t be any more patches, it’s a game that you need to take huge precautions to play it, especially that game breaking bug where the AI truck never returns to the depot.Full review here:https://www.gamespot.com/recycle/user-reviews/2200-12727648/5 / 10 (recommended - barely)"

76561198105379460,Recommended,294830,12038567,"Posted: 9 September, 2014",all,michael.lohan,"I would recommend this game. I got it for 15% off, first of all, so that was cool. Above all else, this is geared as a business simulation, even if you don't get any inference of that from the video. Yes, the graphics are not up to par with PS3 or 4. The movements of the trashmen are somewhat slow, but not horribly so. I have had 3 crashes in about 17 hours of play - twice for the same thing (accidentally grabbing the wrong container type on route setup and instead of just letting it go, I tried to drag it back to it's original spot), and once it said my trash guy was blocked by an obstacle and to move to the open road so he could grab a container. I was in the road at the time. I never went off the road. Aside from that, the game has been uneventful, in respect to glitches/crashes. And yeah, there's only 1 useful camera angle I've found (although I haven't checked them all out, and only checked out 2 views{change views in the options menu}), but so what. It's not like you are playing against other people trying to collect the same trash or shooting at people, lol. Deal with it. Maybe they'll release a patch or two and things will be better. It's a decent enough game. But then again, what the hell do I know? Watch the video and decide for yourself. It's your cash  :)You start off with some cash, a parking lot, and that's it. Buy a truck, buy some route licenses so you can collect the trash, take a short loan to float you buying your own dump, or just dump for free at the municipal dump. Difference is, you get paid to dump it at your own dump. The object is to make money."

Goodish graphics, no lag, steering is a bit too sensitive but I believe you can change that in the settings. Others post negative reviews, if you are like me and have been alerted of this game from Garbage Truck Simulator 2011 this is a massive improvement, you do not get to collect the bins yourself as far as  I am aware and cannot control them overall but you can control them through a list of set actions."

However....There is no way the developer has tested the game play on 50 PCs as they claim. I think they have simply installed on 50 PCs and checked the start up screen loads.This game is not finished. Far from it.Everybody who has bought the game is being used as beta testers. The game sort of works but has too many erros too often.Everybody has reported that the crane truck crashes the game when being unloaded - this is something you would expect to have been picked up in testing. They claim a ptach is on the way and they seem to have had no problem replcating the crash so It really would have been picked up in a even poorly done test phase.My trucks on auto now randomly claim the wrong garbage is being dumped at the wrong place when its not. General waste to the landfills is correct and has been for the last 5 in game days. Now every other dump is wrong apprently.Driving the organic truck and no matter where I park the guy on the back can not get off the truck due to a none existant obstruction.Take the dumper to the incinerator and try to switch back to the crane without driving back to the landfill. Game hangs then crashes.The phyiscs system is ♥♥♥♥. Cars have infinate mass as do street signs. My truck must weigh 15 tons and I have 10 tons or garbage in the back. Why do I bounce off of street signs!!! Yes I am not supposed to be driving it like GTA but a street sign should not stop my truck.Everything is far to happy to ragdoll for the slightest reason. I can make my bulldozer bounce 10 feet high over the landfill. If you stick the handbrake on while unloading a truck at the dump you fire off like a rocket towards the perimeter fance ragdolling along the way.Graphics are extremely poorly optimsed. I have a PC well beyond the recommended specs but get frequent half second freezes and when using the crane to the load the dump truck the FPS drop to about 10 when the claw is full of garbage.The only thing the devs have done well is the trailer video. It makes the game look far better and more interesting then it is. False representation in the extreme.This game needs at least another 12 months of coding just to be playable and maybe even enjoyable."

When you get past the crashes and release bugs it's a really fun game to play. It's not that big or hardcore but it somewhat realistic and fun to play. The variety of vehicles and things to do makes the game enjoyable for quite a while. If you ever get bored you can always go on a rampage and crash into everything. The devs will soon fix the crashes and the bugs and add more updates so it will only get better from this point on. If the game is on sale I would say buy it before it goes off sale as almost anyone would enjoy this. (But not hardcore COD fans who play FPS games all day)"
,Recommended,294830,30571992,Posted: 17 March,all,Aandreas,"I enjoyed playing this game. There is a big similarity to the real world actions of garbage truck operation.Some of the tasks were very labourous though, like filling the garbage tipper wagon at the landfil with the crane claw.That was not very much fun. Then, when you eventually get the tipper truck to the incinerator plant, the truck would mostly glitch out and end up stuck on its side.Sometimes there were large industrial bins, (not the ordinary bins), that you couldn't get to because of restricted access, due to street signs and other street furnature like lamp posts being in the way. So you could not complete all of the bins because your AI guys on the back would not go get the bins.The recycle machine that lifts the glass and other bins is awkward to operate.Overall - I liked playing it and I think you will too!Its cheap enough to just buy and play once and not start crying if you don't like it."

This is very difficult if it is being done from a keyboard and the turns are too quickly done due the scale.  There is no reason to have to go through hiring a helper as he is needed to move the truck.  You have to tell the helper to either get on the back of the truck or in the cab.  Tell him go the garbage can, to bring it to the truck, to dump the trash, to return to the truck, all before where to get in or on the truck.  This could be a good management game or a driving game but should not be both."

I think this game is great! Yes you will be collecting garbage over and over but everyone out there that is saying the camera views don't work and it crashes on startup, if you go to the community hub and look at the posts by the developers you will see that they tell you how to fix it. Because I had the same issue upon release. But within 1 hour the Dev's were helping on the forums and got it fixed ASAP. And now I get full camera views and no crash on start.I really really enjoyed this game. I think it was well done and not for everyone but if you are a hardcore simmer then its a good pruchase. I would recommend this game to any true hardcore simmer!Here is how to fix the issue: You need to go to your games route folder in steam and add these lines to the file indicated in this post:http://steamcommunity.com/app/294830/discussions/0/613935403968896289/It worked for me! And for the last time people. I am NOT a game Developer, Just a happy customer!"

Still has a lot of bugs. crane is verry laggy in the land fill. A  Front End Loader would be better and faster, crane literaly takes hours to load a truck, by the time you load the truck at the land fill to take the garbage to the incenerator you don't want to play anymore."

I'm not going put effort in fixing it because they should be the ones that fix it not the person paying $21. Hoping for multiplayer later on if the game ever works

After all with the ability and very quickly to be able to own 5 garage spots each holding 6 vehicles managing all those every day is just not realistic, any compay would hve those vehicles already on a set rota system, something tha could ahve been easy to include in the game.2nd you can either drive a vehicle or autoroute it, great idea, but what would have been better is being able to hot jump into different vehicles as you saw fit, would have been more fun and rewarding, but thats where the lack of game development does show, the routes taken by the vehicles on autoroute do ot take the fastest route and do not simulate the actual collection unseen, instead they go on a set route linked to the collection route and drive righ back to base, disappear for around 1 game hour and then park up to be re-assigned on another route.just these 2 areas alone do let the game down and things that even in part were addressed would improve overall game play3rd no competition, not just that but there is no route development either and with the technology in games that is available today this is one aspect that could have been looked at more, routes could have been linked to the garage sites owened as well as the current criteria, plus how well you do with the routes you do have should have abearing on if other routes become available to you, poor performance on any route should see you potentially lose that route due o your customers opting to use another competitor - again totally over looked.4th Lack of any real campaign mode, really this could ahve been a much bigger and beter game if you were able to expand your business from say a village to start with up into a town and then a city, havint to manage them as you would a real business and making use of technologies as they appear.5th WTF no pause! and not just that the only speed option is a pointless x4, really there should havebeen more options on this considering you only have from 9am to 4pm each day to micro manage your fleet.Can I recommend this game? at the price its now dropped to, sure you have nothing to lose and it is still a game hat if opened up somewhere down the line o modders could really be improved and take off, failing that maybe just maybe the devs are taking on board commens hat have been amde and actually see the real potential this game has and decide o do something about it, but we can all live in hope right?"

The last update was over a year ago so I doubt that will be corrected.
