Didn't realize that the game is only 15 minutes long and only has about 5 screens that aren't duplicates of each other.  Then I finished it and went through it again thinking that must be the idea.  Nope...it's the same game.  Unless there's some amazing reveal or area that I missed,  I wouldn't bother spending 6 dollars on something that seems like it should be a demo or freeware."
,Not Recommended,295250,10182756,"Posted: 20 May, 2014",all,The Centipede,"I grew up on point-and-click adventure games, particularly the old Sierra ones. This reminded me of 'em and so I got it on the cheap since I've also got Proteus and Waking Mars.This is more like Proteus than Waking Mars; it's about wandering, having no real point or distinct rhyme or reason. Everything is presented without explanation; you're stranded on a planet with no background and get to walk (slowly) through alien vistas to visit robotic temples without explanation. The artwork is nice, yes, as is the music, but none of it is groundbreaking, /especially/ if you're over a certain age and remember EGA and VGA adventure games of the late 1980s and early 1990s at all.The problem here isn't so much the lack of explanation. This is definitely aiming towards minimalist 'art' and encouraging user interpretation (though I once had an argument with a collage artist that, since art is a form of communication, /something/ must be intended by all artistic design choices--if the artist completely abrogates the work of interpretation to the observer, then the artist is not communicating and could be doing absolutely /anything/).The problem is the pacing.This is quite possibly intentional.Your little astronaut walks slowly. All the screens have to be backtracked. In one playthrough, there just isn't that much to see. In my playthrough, I wandered through all the available screens three times over to be rewarded with... well... let's just say a game over that had as little explanation as anything else, though in hindsight it was a good game over since it illuminated just a little bit more of the world the developers created.Are there different endings? I don't know, and that's where the problem comes in. The manual encourages leaving the game alone and waiting for things to happen; something about how actions are static but the world is dynamic or something. That's fine, but even then the amount of time it takes for your character to walk from one side of the screen to the other is an investment that doesn't have much payoff. Is there any guarantee that if you leave it running for an hour and then come back and wait the one or two minutes it takes to change screens that you'll get something different? No.I don't want to sound like an anti-art game philistine, so I have to compare this to other works. Proteus, which is equivalently aimless, rewards running around and backtracking by being immediately interactive. Starseed Pilgrim encourages exploration by hiding the backstory in rhyme. The Swapper gives you new things to look at, backstory, and moral dilemma without relying on kinetics or speed. The Endless Forest at the very least interacts with you, and its artistic bent is /anti-kinetic/. The Graveyard had you moving very slowly, but every step added to the story (and it didn't suggest that there was replay value in an attempt to become a time sink).Stranded offers none of these things, and certainly does nothing to suggest that it has more to it. It almost seems to be given away by the tagline: ""Do you know what it is to die alone, and so far from home?""Seems like it is to shuffle around a bit and then, well, die alone in a godless universe and out of shake-n'-vac."

The one hour of playtime I've clocked in? That's two playthroughs. My first one, with plenty of roaming about and exploration, took 45 minutes. The remaining 15 minutes was poking around trying to see if there were other endings.I'd like to recommend this game, I really would. The atmosphere and the visuals are wonderful, and remind me of the old LucasArts adventure game, The Dig. I would have loved to explore the world more, see if it had more to offer, but there's so little of it here.That said, I do not regret the time spent on the game. If you enjoy the sort of visuals that Dig might have to offer and find this one at a steep discount, it's worth at least a quick look, provided you don't come without much in the way of expectations. Otherwise, skip this one."

But the game does NOT come with a soundtrack. The OST costs $6 when really it should be included.As per the walking part, it's really annoying to have to wait till the animation is finished. But that's to be expected for a Ren'Py game.I really wish more things were done with this game. It's an amazing concept, very atmospheric. But there's nothing to do beyond walking. To call this Point & Click is far too accurate. You point, click, and you look. If you're looking for something with a similar atmosophere and more gameplay, check out The Swapper.I spent exactly 36 minutes playing this game and have exhuasted it of all content. Can't really complain much because I used a 20% voucher I got from Proteus."

Each time, however, the only thing this game left me with, was one wish: the wish somebody would turn this piece of software into a real *GAME*, into a point & click adventure. I absolutely ADORE the gorgeous pixel art, the animation and the atmosphere. It reminds me of some mystical places you could visit on Mars in ""Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders"" or on the planet Cocytus in ""The Dig"".However, this is NOT a point & click adventure in the classical sense, even though it might look the part!It is merely a game in which you go from one screen to the next – and not in a fluid motion either; the protagonist can stand in up to 6 places in each screen and you really have to wait a lot until he/she actually moves – and try to interact with something. I write ""try to interact"" because it really is that! Most of the time, your clicking doesn't achieve anything. There are so many interesting objects and characters(?) on screen but there's just nothing you can do with them.All in all, more than anything else, Stranded feels like some sort of experiment.Which is a shame. This could have been SO MUCH MORE!At the current price tag, it's something you *can* buy just for the beautiful art. Better yet, however: wait for it to be discounted and try it then!"

You know, I got nothing against atmosphere-driven games likeDear EstherorThe Plan, I love them. But those titles have unique look, sound, mood. Here, though, everything is plain boring. Look, sound and mood. Graphics lack charm like inGemini RueorLone Survivor, music is not something outstanding, but good, I'll give them that.And gameplay is a disaster. Total boredom. You do nothing but click on the edges of the screen to walk. PlusStrandedis super, too short: you can beat it in around 10 minutes. If it was free, it would be fine by me, but for this price don't buy it. Because I did and was very disappointed."

No real substance here, you basically just walk around (slowly and unskippably) throughout the same few rooms, triggering events until you finally reach the ending. Then you are done.It's more of a demo or proof of concept than a game.Hopefully their next work,Murder, will have some actual gameplay, as the art is quite decent for a small indie dev."
,Recommended,295250,10192215,"Posted: 21 May, 2014",all,CueZero,"While obviously not for everyone, Stranded is a unique audio/visual experience that is extremely pleasing to the eyes and ears. The setting is incredibly mysterious, and you're thrown into an unknown world with little to no explanations. As you leave your marooned ship you'll slowly discover the secrets of your surrounding, and watch them change as the days and nights pass by. This feels more akin to an art project than a video game, and I love it.The game itself is very slow paced, which feels necessary for the story being told and the tense atmosphere being created as you travel further away from your base. This deliberate pacing only serves the creeping feeling of lostness and wonder, allowing you to take in your surroundings and focus on the sound of every breath you take.The soundtrack is a masterpiece and serves as much more than your standard background music as it evolves with every action you take, building up and changing as you visit different temples or advance between night and day. The dynamic soundtrack reminded me of Proteus, and is my favorite aspect of these games.In the end Stranded is a short but sweet experience that most people looking for a ""gaming"" session will be disappointed with, but those of you with a serious appreciation for lovingly detailed art, sound design, and storytelling will find a very memorable experience that is more than your money's worth."

It's a fine use of 30 minutes, as long as you're fine with only getting some atmospheric music and a small amount of wandering out of that experience. But that's all the game has for it, nothing more substantial than that, and the ending, while certainly not what I was expecting, is still little more than a curiosity."
,Not Recommended,295250,10274586,"Posted: 29 May, 2014",all,galthubu,"Worst buyer-seller relationship ever.It's a poor game, more of a game-demo space-walking simulator with a non-riddle which trigger an ending after 30mn of walk playing. I had read a preview on RPS, which was quite great, quoting nostalgia, Lucas Arts and The Dig. But The Dig was a much longer experiment. And it had story. And it had gameplay. And it even had humour.There, as you wander in the deserted landscapes of Stranded, you have none. No story, no riddles, no gameplay, no humour. Just an excrucciating pain in the butt when the end is triggered.7$? Really?I was intrigued, so I sent an e-mail to the creator. I wanted to share with him my disappointment and try to have his side of the story.He didn't accept any of my arguments (and I tried quoting others sci-fi point&click adventures), discarding them with a poor ""I'm sorry you didn't like [...] This was exactly the game I wanted to create, and was highly experimental (as you'll find detailed in the game's Steam description, if you care to read it)"". But I read the steam description, and it was never written nor said it was a 30mn experimental software.I tried understanding the 7$ price setting, again using comparison with other one-man-job-game (Antichamber is a good example I used, has Alexander Bruce charged for his game 150$ because he spent 7 years making it? No, it was around 15$, and they're the best 15$ I ever spent in a videogame). Stranded creator's answer was ""I can charge whatever I like for [my work]"".He seems to be in a Proteus allegiance, but doesn't seem to notice how Proteus is a far wider experiment to try. Proteus has a lot more variations in its landscapes, far more tricks to make the player explore its changing island(s). If Proteus was in 2D, it would have proposed more than 10 martian-like backgrounds.There's no point trying to compare Walking Mars, Proteus or The Dig to Stranded. Stranded is merely a 30mn game demo which aspires to big as big as his iconic elder but without doing the work needed to.Peter Moorhead (Stranded creator) wrote me ""No one made you buy the game, and no one tried to pretend it was something it isn't."" This sentence definitely showed me there wasn't any dialog available, and with this kind of answers, I feel definitely robbed, scammed, almost abused. Wrapping a game with mystery is not for young Peter a misleading way of selling it. Letting his steam store page quite empty isn't lying to the customer.  Lying by omission isn't for young Peter a so big deal.As you can read in some comments, buying Stranded will get you the ""you spent 7$ for this crap"" achievement.Nothing more.I wish I could have a refund..."

I got a fifteen-minute demo.Walking is excrutiatingly slow, and is animation-locked to certain points on the screen. You want to cross this empty room (of which there are several and backtracking is absolutely required)? Then you wait for your ""walk onscreen: animation to finish, click the other side of the room, wait for your ""walk across the screen"" animation to finish, then click AGAIN to play your ""walk offscreen"" animation.There is literally no interaction with anything beyond going to sleep and walking through doors. It LOOKS like there's a puzzle involving symbols in ancient temples and a floor covered in similar symbols, but in fact it's not a puzzle at all, merely dressed like one.Save your seven bucks and buy yourself a coffee. It'll be more entertaining and last longer too."
,Not Recommended,295250,10193341,"Posted: 21 May, 2014",all,Synit,"What a rip-off. I get that it is supposed to be aesthethic. For a game that supposedly focuses on exploration there isn't much exploring to do. You start in a space ship, explore maybe 15 different screens (Most of them being duplicates with different colors) with NOTHING to click at all. You just walk from screen to screen. There is no discernable story at all, not one that makes sense at least.Not to mention the game is only 15-30minutes long. And it has NO replay value.I am generally a fan of small Indie Sci-Fi games and i absolutely adore point and click adventures, games like Machinarium, Deponia and Resonance are just some of the good ones. All great games and all of them bring unique twists to the Point and Click genre.Stranded however seems in my oppinion to try to hard to be something it is not. They say ""It is both a love letter to classic point & click adventures, and an experiment with the fundamentals of the genre."" Sure i can believe it is a love letter, but i wouldn't call it an experiement with the genre. It is just a Point and Click stripped of everything that makes a Point and Click so good.It's basically a point and click railroad experience where you in 20-30 minutes of boredom, are forced to repeat the exact same steps 3 times over and over with a character that walks SO slowly that you will mummify before the game is over.So if you came here looking for a Sci-Fi experience, Point and Click or an Exploration game, even just a good game. Don't bother even touching it, you WILL be dissapointed to the point of just wishing you could get your money back.If you absolutely want to spend $7 on something, you are better of going to your local supermarked and buying yourself the softest most expensive toilet paper available, at least that will give you some comfort and joy, and it will last longer than this game as well."

,Not Recommended,295250,10200794,"Posted: 22 May, 2014",all,Astrobia,"*sigh* I want to recomend this but I can't. Even as a new release $8 is way to much for the experience offered, even $2 would be pushing it. Theres about 3 minutes of actual gameplay and the rest is just mindless wandering using a terribly clunky interface. As it stands you would be better off taking your money and spending $5 on ""The Dig"" by Lucas arts. Hours of gameplay, just as visually and audably pleasing and a much deeper more moving story. As for Stranded if you want to try it wait until it's in a humble bundle or something.See I want to appriciate this game for what it is... But I can't shake the feeling that ""what it is"" is someone with higher aspirations deciding it was too much work and just cropping it and selling it as is to make money off the time they already invested. The art is great and the soundtrack is nice but that's all it has going for it... And for context if you look at the screenshots and gameplay video above you've seen about 70% of the art and nearly all of the soundtrack. The map consist of about 15 scenes, there is no interaction with any of them... All you can do is walk between them which is a painful experience as the controls are frequently unresponsive and for someone looking for a way to surivive before time runs out your character strolls a long like they have all the time in the world.To their credit the scenes aren't static. NPC's wander around, theres a day/night cycle of sorts (relevent to the progression of the shallow plot... Yes even ignoring the slow walking the uninteractive game length is unnecassirly padded out by having to backtrack to your pod and trigger night fall several times). There are also a few events to witness which sum up as watching an NPC do something when you enter a scene at certain times of day/night progression (you can't interact with them)... That's all there is to the game. Wander about painfully slowly. See all the locations. Leave the game running to see if anything different happens (it doesn't really). Slowly wander around to all the locations again to see what events you can spot... Rince and repeat until the third day at which point the credits will roll and the game is over.I just want to clarify, I do in fact get it. I see what the game is trying to convey... Is it art? Arguably. See what defines a succesful art piece is if it succesfully conveys what the artist is trying to communicate. For example some artist do ironic intentionally garbage peices with intent of conveying that the piece of art they have created is a piece of crap. If I look at that art piece and say to myself ""that's a piece of crap garbage"" it's a succesful art piece. That's not necassarily a worthy accomplishment in and of itself though.See theres a few things this game tries to convey in sort of a sureal fashion. A sense of isolation, desperation (it fails on a couple of levels there) and questioning of value of life/survival. Now that sounds interesting in theory and the presentation they've come up with for it looks and sounds pretty but overall it falls flat as there is no depth to it. They've deliberately stretched out the pacing of the game to attempt to add value to it and all they've done is make it boring and pointless.There's no deeper insight to be gained by standing around or slowly trudging between the same backdrops you've seen multiple times already. They tout exploration is what's on offer but theres nothing to really explore. It's a short liniar experience and like I said at the begining, everything there is to see and experience you could do so in 3 minutes without the padding... And what is conveyed in those 3 minutes isn't worth a $2 compared to other deeper more compelling titles in same genre and setting which are actually cheaper then this cash grab...Which sadly seems to be the only way to look at this release. They say it's a love letter... But it's not even really a post card. It's a hallmark card they didn't even bother to write a personal message in. I say it's sad because you can kind of see where they wanted to go with it. Theres a solid idea there but it looks like they made the concious decision to not actually flesh it out or even do any quality assurance work on it to make it a smooth play experience (theres not screen size options, controls are clunky, no save feature which admitadly it shouldn't need but given the amount of standing around and waiting you need to do it kind of does). It's sort of the equivelent of a film student making a 5 minute experimental film and selling it on DVD for $30 a pop on the premise that it's indie art and that somehow justifies it. Which saddens me because it devalues other artisitic works of merit in it's medium.Now in fareness making videogames is hard work. Can be expensive work too. If you are not willing to commit to put in the hard yards that's fine but don't expect renumeration for it. Now to be clear I do like this game. It's nice, and without the padding it would be a pleasant and even interesting little aside. As it stands though I've played flash games the author has put more work into making a deeper more moving and certainly more compelling experience out of and they didn't see fit to charge me anything to share that expression of their creativity, they knew the market value for what they were offering didn't justify it. That is why I can't recomend this title. The scope of the game does not justify the price at all. Even as a donation to the artist $8 a pop is beyond generous. What makes writing this review difficult is I do want to encourage indie artist to make more games in this ilk... What I don't want to do is encourage this sort of blatant capitalism from them after they make a cursory token effort."

Mainly because there was no explanation for it or anything at all...To be honest... With the short story and no great plot or anything deep in this game... I started getting angry about the long animations - because my thought got to that they might as well have had to pull out gametime in order to make it up for that  half-hearted story and for the fact that the game was about doing 4 things to complete...And what better way to do that than making the animations for the player's movement take longer time?I'm really disappointed in spending money on this...

This doesn't make sense. If there was something you could do differently at the various points, some sense of agency or reasoning to this break, it could be forgiven. But there's not. You just need to cross half a dozen screens, and it takes a minimum of 2 clicks each to do it. The walking would at least be tolerably if you didn't have to click, wait for the slow character to move to the EDGE of the screen... and then click again to walk that last 10% of the distance.The storyline is so scant it's virtually nonexistant, and I wager while many would try to argue their interpretation of the events, the truth seems to be that either there's nothing going on here that isn't readily apparent (spoiler: not a lot going on), or -if there's more to it- you'll have to read what the author SAYS is the deeper story somewhere outside the game because the game doesn't do it.I wouldn't recommend buying this, even on sale.

Also, since there's no menu screen whatsoever you have to Ctrl-Alt-Delete to close the game as far as I could figure out...A pet peeve of mine with point-and-clickers is when the cursor does not change at all when you mouse over something you can interact with, making the interactive object hidden in what can only be described as a way to punish the player.Plenty of areas that are only good for wasting your time as your character moves slowly from one side of the screen to the other.

It has also given birth to a multitude of talentless hacks, who possess neither craftmanship nor originality, but who claim that people who do not appreciate their works just don't understand them.I am sorry, but I have to share Stranded amongst the products of talentless hacks.It is not that it is worthless. But it is definitely not worth the asking price. There is nothing in the game that makes its value rise above a couple of dimes.I do appreciate that people try to progress the art of games, by steering away from the standard fare and trying to insert something original. An original story, original visuals, original use of sound, original gameplay, original ideas. And I am not the only one who appreciates that: it looks like gamers are generally willing to support such attempts at originality, and buy experimental games in droves.Experimental games are often commercial successes. I am not surprised that therefore we now get people trying to create games with little work and try to sell them off as ""idea games"" that ""the masses cannot understand"" but that you really should buy because they are ""high art"".Stranded is minimalistic. It is based on pixel art. It has only about a dozen screens, a great many of which are rehashes of other screens in the same game. It has minimalistic music which gets boring after half a minute. It has virtually no gameplay - the only thing you can do is move a tiny astronaut around, and that is at such a slow pace that it becomes a chore really quickly. And even with that slowly moving astronaut, you play this ""game"" to the ending in less than 45 minutes. Because there is nothing to do, only moving, and once you have moved to the right places in the right order, the ending automatically plays. You can hardly call this a ""game"". It could easily have been just a short movie, or a series of paintings, as the player really doesn't do anything.The only reason to make this a game is to let the player identify with the character that he or she controls, but that doesn't happen here. The player has no reason to empathize with the tiny astronaut or get immersed in the game.""But,"" the game's supporters will say, ""this is not about the gameplay! It is about the atmosphere! It is about a feeling of wonder and loneliness!"" Yeah, right. I hardly felt wonder, apart from wondering what the hooplah was all about. And I definitely did not feel lonely. I felt ripped off.Stranded has been compared to The Dig. And indeed, The Dig provides a feeling of wonder when the protagonists enter an alien world, filled with weird contraptions they cannot understand, but which seem to have an inherent logic to them. It also provides a feeling of loneliness as the protagonists seem to have no means of escape and have to rely only on themselves. The Dig is not perfect as a game, but it brought original elements to the table which rarely had been seen before.Stranded gives me the impression that the author has tried to create the same kind of atmosphere as The Dig provided, but was unwilling to put in the required work. He could have created a series of paintings, but pixel art is easier, and games sell better than paintings.I believe that the creation of originality in games should be encouraged. But the creation of games that try to get sold on the notion that they are ""original"" while they are actually a cheaply-produced attempt at a quick commercial success should be discouraged.Rather than buy Stranded, see that you get a copy of The Dig. It provides what Stranded unsuccessfully tried to do, and much, much more."

The length of the game is mostly taken up by your character's clunky movement.It took a lot of aimless wandering and pointless clicking to get to the 4 inconveniently distanced temples, 3 different times.The ending, rushed as it was, felt cliche and a little insulting to my intelligence. I actually let out a laugh as I'd realised what had happened, and spent at least 10 minutes contemplating my character's fate.I would recommend this game, were it not for the insulting price of $7.99 (AUD).A more reasonable amount would be towards the $0.99 range, but even then I would feel a tad let down.All in all, the game had a lot of potential, but the length and clunky gameplay left me very, very disappointed."

Gameplay is also simple; click on a part of the screen to slowly walk there, and click on the edge of the screen to slowly move to the next area. As you explore, events will unfold, and eventually an ending will smack you in the face.Stranded makes the peculiar mistake of homaging old school point-and-click adventure games by removing everything fun from them (goofy humor, engaging puzzles, clever writing), and leaving only the prehistoric limitations of the SCUMM engine. The whole experience won't take you more than an hour to complete, and the majority of that time will be spent watching your silent spaceperson march across the same tiny patches of landscape again and again. I can't say for certain that there aren't some secrets hidden here that I haven't discovered, but the experience was drawn out enough to kill any interest in doing so.

Unfortunatley the game is minimalist to a fault and isn't even a pale imitation of the two aforementioned games. I get the impression that the game is going for more of a ""play it for the ambience"" feel that Proteus went for, but where as Proteus had a failry expansive and populated world to absorb, Stranded has nothing similar to hold it up. The world is just a few screens, several of which are filler, and whereas the majority of the world in Proteus responded to you in some way, once again Stranded has nothing of the sort, it is essentially a dead world in every sense of the word. Your interactions are limited to clicking on a location, your character will then plod very slowly to that location. So, yeah, walking is what you do. The game has some nice pixel art but whether you think 10 or 15 screens of nice pixel art is worth the price is down to the individual, though you can get the much better looking and much more substantial Superbrothers Sword & Sworcery for about the same price so I really cant reccomend this.

There's no inventory system of any kind as you don't interact with anything at all aside from walking into an area and sometimes seeing colored lights flash or a stone golem guy stand around.  The map system seems completely pointless since the game world is small enough that you have no chance of getting lost.  The ending seemed very artsy-fartsy too.

It is ""Meh"".This may be my fault for not reading more of the description of the game. But i assumed this would be a point and click Adventure. As ""Adeventure"" is one of this visual experience's Genre titles.It's not, it no more encourages you to click on anything besides the sides of the map.For a game like this... I'd expect better controls than this. The slow walk speed i can take, but the fact that i can not change direction if i miss click (In the assumption that i can explore each screen) on the map Is quite annoying. A similar flaw i didn't enjoy was that i couldn't just click once to tell my character to leave the screen. She walks to the side of the map and then waits for a command to actually leave the screen. As if assuming i may have wanted to stay on the screen longer than her walk cycle.I will say the enviroments seem beautiful, but lack luster for a game about nothing more than enviroments... It could have been more animated for one? moving clouds and flickering lighting is roughly all i saw.And while i do not know the costs of such an endeavor it would have been appreciated for making this game slightly less tedious.There is no adventure here. You follow the stories direction. You do not get to explore this world. You follow where it wants you to go.And if you don't you have to suffer more of the walk cycle, you do not get to experience anything more out of this game if you take the road less trod. You get depressed by your mistake and attempt to look around less each time, it is by luck i went back to my ship and decided to touch the pod to see if it did anything.Maybe if i was in the mood to play something like this i'd have been okay with it but i wasn't expecting something like this.I can't call this a terrible game but i will call it flawed. It's sadly flawed. I was interested by this game and the odd story it told, but when i can't experience the story without getting annoyed by the (should be) utterly simple controls; its a terribly sad day in gaming.The one thing that motivated me to keep going and not close out after noticing these flaws was the music, i will say the music composer did a wonderful job and i hope they go on to make wonderful successes in better games. Maybe better games by the same people; if i can be hopeful.I can't recommend this game at its normal $8 price tag, as i would have returned this if i had.Try this game if it's on sale and if you like games such as this. Otherwise ""Meh""."

Yes, the interaction is very limited, and the slow walking speed and somewhat clunky controls would definitely cripple it as a game, but I don't feel like that's how you should be approaching Stranded. It's an ambient, somewhat meditative experience, backed by a soundtrack that nicely plays off of and back into the environment; even the walking adds to the ambiance. If you try to get more than that out of it, you will be disappointed, but if you're letting it be what it is, Stranded can probably give you a very enjoyable hour or so.Finally, is it worth getting?

It reminds me a lot of the old science fiction stories from the 50s and 60s. The ones with barely any action, characters or narrative, you know. The stories that were a lot about painting a strange, alien world and showing it to the reader and not so much about people caught in some distress that they have to fight out of. It’s a game in which you have to pay attention to details and interpret what you see.As such, I enjoyed it. And as such it suffers from being too vague, too minimalistic, too bare, too small and too short. Well, maybe it suffers from that.

I'm hearing rumors that opening it a second time, the game is different, but I haven't tried it yet, so it's possible there is more play time than that.  However, the slow pacing and short play time do conspire to build a lot of suspense, and also allow you to play through the whole story in one sitting, which increases the emotional impact.  A more serious complaint is the ample reuse of generic scenery (rocks and plants) in a completely scenery oriented game.  Several of the intermediate screens are basically identical.I would also have appreciated a tiny bit more interaction with the world.  Particularly, I found it very bizarre to stand next to these crazy incredible stone giants, that are clearly breathing and walking around, and to be unable to interact with them in any way.  Like, being able to poke them or have them make a sound when you click on them or something would have made them feel more present I think.However, all things considered, I think this game is worth the cost and the time to play it, as a unique and moving piece of art.  (What do we call this?  ""Audiovisual experience"" seems to be the hot word right now.  I would not really call this a game, nor is it exactly an interactive movie, although that is a bit closer.  I might call it a poem)"

But if what you care about is atmosphere, art direction, music, and subtle storytelling, it will satisfy you. Because all of those elements are excellent in Stranded, in an '80s sci-fi sort of way. You may even, like me, appreciate that it acheives its effect without demanding much of your time."

Much like Proteus, its simplicity and minimalism style is both its greatest strength and greatest weakness. If you are expecting an interesting point-and-click thriller, I would suggest purchasing Gemini Rue or Resonance or Primordia. However, like Proteus, the game is an interesting experiment in how a- and I somewhat hesitate using this term to describe both- game can evoke feelings in a player. There is an undercurrent of mystery, of secrets that lie hidden, and the beauty and wonder of the world you're on elicits a sense of exploration and awe. So, if you are looking for a game, perhaps don't buy this. If you are looking for an experience, perhaps you've found one."

If you see it on sale, perhaps pick it up, but do be aware that it is very short (less than an hour), and has no challenge at all.This is a game about exploration with some rather subtle meaning behind it. Like I said, there is very little gameplay, not even a puzzle really, but its gorgeous graphics and great music make it worthwhile to play."
,Recommended,295250,12381767,"Posted: 5 October, 2014",all,S1MUL4CR4,"Terse and understated, Stranded offers a minimalist interface and a subtle yet poignant plot that you must deduce yourself by wandering through the small world and observing what happens around you. The artwork offers a compelling snapshot of an alien planet, set to a beautiful, ambient soundtrack that makes the silent and lonely setting all the more striking. The overall effect is pensive and haunting, more than compensating for the game's small size and short duration: Stranded can be completed within 30 minutes. Likewise, the player uses a short list of controls--""S"" for screenshot, ""F"" for fullscreen, and left-clicking for movement and environment interaction. Resembling a scifi short story, Stranded is a simple and thoughtful game that I would recommend to any serious gamer who enjoys an artful experience."

There is no replayability in that. Most of that 30 minutes is due to a super slow walk speed (and a weird thing where you walk to the edge of the screen, but then not transfer over).The slow walk speed really just made it a chore to beat. If you walked faster (or double clicking the edge of the screen would fast travel), the game would be shorter, but I think would be much better. At that point I could give it a thumbs up and recomend buying it for a dollar or two for a ten minute diversion.As is, this is almost nothing to this game beyond the art style, and you get most of that from the store page."
