Although this list is a lot of negatives, I think the game was definitely worth its asking price. It really needed some ironing out, but the execution is otherwise amazing.+ Voiceacting is good. Cartoony as hell, but good.+ Art style is cool. Also cartoony.+ Animations are fairly smooth.+ The setting and story are both unique and GREAT, and I wouldn't hesitate to describe the whole game as ""cute.""+ The puzzle solving mechanics are very interesting. There's a lot of unique abilties you have, and they each have a different cost. There are usually several different ways to approach every situation, and you have to think ahead to avoid wasting certain resources.+ Failure doesn't usually mean a lot of restarting - it usually means you'll have to try again a different way, since you've wasted resources.+ The difficulty ramp has a good, satisfying feel to it.+ I love and look forward to the dialogue. It can be cheesy, but it knows that.+ The characters aren't incredibly remarkable, but they certainly aren't boring templates.- VERY buggy. Enemies can get stuck in unreachable places, entire areas can become uncompleteable(although you can reset an area if that does happen), green goo is sometimes instadeath, sometimes not(something that I speculate has to do with getting stuck between non-square hitboxes), there are several buggy animations and behaviors in some enemies, and yet other enemies' movement is too wonky for a perfect clear to be worthwhile.- Damage is not always properly communicated. If you're not paying attention, you won't notice that leptons and bombs actually do hurt SC. Sometimes, green goo makes it look like it didn't damage you because nothing really happens - but it did.- The procedural generation of the main areas is unfortuantely not quite as interesting as it sounds, because you get so many resources that there is little to no challenge in any of the puzzle portions - it's all platforming, navigating and not being chewed up by electrons.- SFX are just a tad annoying.- Camera movement is awful in some zones.- Jumping control takes a while to get used to. You can usually stop on a dime, but you gain momentum in a very unstable manner.- It feels like there's a lot of unused potential in the way antiquarks act.- Short play length - about nine hours if you're not unrealistically going for a perfect clear. Fifteen to twenty hours in that case."

The humor is AMAZING, and I definitely love the theme--there aren't many games with living subatomic particles out there.The game provides a good platforming challenge, especially the ""RUN!"" levels, where you're forced to come up with combos on the fly.There are a few design elements that are a bit strange, though. I can understand why the neutrinos are invisible, but where are the photons? You got gluons and W & Z bosons, but no photons?! Also I have NO idea why a tauon would eat you when it has zero size to begin with....and the strange matter apocalypse is ruled out by cosmic ray collisions. Just saying.But video game wise, this thing is really really good.Now I just have to pitch that idea for an RPG where you combine atoms into molecules and make them fight each other..."

I caught a fleeting glimpse of the title of this game and I knew that it must be mine; it was one of the best decisions I have ever made.

The puzzles are at times fiendishly difficult, but all solvable within the design of the game, often in a variety of different ways.  The humour and voice acting are pretty fantastic as well, thanks to awesome voice work by the guy who played Marty McFLy in the Back to the Future video games.  Very fun game, especially if you're up for a challenge."
,Recommended,295490,30301223,Posted: 3 March,all,Kanturis,"If you want a game with cats, platforming, puzzles and a day out at the Particle Zoo, you can't go far wrong with Schrodinger's Cat and the Raiders of the Lost Quark.To start with the good things - the tutorial introduces you to Schrodinger's Cat and the issues the Particle Zoo is having and gets you familiar with the different Quarks you'll collect and their quirks (I had to, I'm sorry).  The different quarks can be used to help you navigate the challenges you'll come across – 3 Up/Movement quarks will combine to make a helicopter that will lift you, 3 Bottom/Construction Quarks will make a platform to stand on, 3 Down/Destruction Quarks will make a drill that removed ground from beneath you and 3 Top/Protection Quarks will make a protective bubble around you.  Why 3?  You can combine the quarks together in ways that are fairly intuitive – Combining 3 quarks of Up/Movement and Down/Destruction will create a missile you can fire.  Or Up/Movment, Down/Destruction, and Top/Protection will make a bomb you can throw.  There's 14 combinations in all and they use the appearance of the different quarks to help make them more memorable.  They can be seen at any time in game at any time with the start button once you've done them so if you forget one you can easily check.The game gives you free platforming areas between the different 'enclosure' areas (which are much more puzzle based).  It's relatively easy to build up a small army of quarks to navigate the areas and take on the (optional) task of capturing all of the rogue particles and although they work well for a chance to practice different quark combinations it felt like a lot of backtracking between the enclosures.  That might have been that it seemed to give me very similar areas but that might be bad luck on my part with the game's random generation of the zones or might be because of the similar appearance of the terrain.The puzzle sections are a welcome change from them and my favourite part of the game.  More limited in quarks but interesting problems to overcome and thinking time isn't an issue.  The later enclosures need a little more thinking but it's still satisfying to overcome.The last main section type is chase style encounters that will challenge you to find the right combinations quickly to avoid being eaten by the creatures that are chasing you.  Depending on how good you are at these, they'll either be very fun or highly frustrating as you find yourself back at the beginning of the section, going through the same motions to get back to the part you messed up.There's a lot of humour in the game and unique designs for each of the quarks and characters in the game that make it easy to tell things apart and help keep things fresh as the plot progresses.The game is voiced by A.J. LoCascio and although he has the task of voicing all the characters he does an excellent job giving everyone their own character and style.  I honestly didn't realise it was just one voice actor until seeing it in the credits.I only encountered two bugs during my playthrough, one was just visual at the end of a chase section where it the game didn't appear to load the rest of the chasing creature. The other was an instance of the game not making enough quarks in a puzzle section but it was easily remedied with reloading the checkpoint.  Certainly nothing serious in my experience.I completed the game in under 8 hours but I enjoyed it, it's probably closer to 5/6 hours if you're good at platforming games.  I'd certainly recommend it on sale but it's not a bad deal even at its full price."

The plot is funny as well.The gameplay suits me quite nicely - although it might not be the most challenging one in a platformer, especially not for the veterans of that genre out there.It has some cool new sides to it - you play on the keyboard only, but with both hands - one for moving, one for the quarks. By combining the quarks with your arrow keys, you proceed through the game - forming platforms, shields and so on...Although this game has its flaws (some minor bugs with terrain you want to explode and which doesn't work properly, and sometimes the controls can be a bit slow), I fully recommend it. The price is quite cheap, so the ratio between what you pay and what you get is pretty good!"

Team 17 also was involved with games from the Worms series (which I love). They did not disappoint:It's a great platformer with an interesting ""combo"" system that uses quarks you find along the way. It has a simple start tutorial. I haven't beaten the game yet but I am having a lot of fun solving the puzzles it is presenting me. I have noticed it has a ""restart area"" option (pressing ENTER) and I did not notice a life counter (so I assume infinite lives). So there's really not a reason to stop playing if you can't beat a puzzle.It's probably one of the best purchases I have ever done in this account, nice change from games like CS:GO."
,Recommended,295490,18363188,"Posted: 6 October, 2015",all,Brian C. (The Schmaltzy Cynic),"I would recommend this game as a cautious recommendation at best. The combo mechanic with okay-if-floaty platforming controls makes for a fun, original experience.The real question you should ask before purchasing is how much can you stand ear-grating one-liners or annoying personalities? Also, do you like physics?Schrodinger's Cat: The Procrastinator of Videogame Character AbilitiesLike most cats, they don't do the work but get other people to do the work for them. This is how Schrodinger works with the combo ability system.Here you combine three quarks (out of four) in order to result in some combination. There are fourteen total and nearly all of them are well-used throughout the game.You can make a parachute, a bubble-shield, a missile, a decoy disco machine and even a helicopter. The four quarks are given to you from the start, and they serve as Schrodinger's abilities (besides his attack) and as his groupies.On a controller, the shoulder buttons and triggers use one type of quark. On keyboard they have their respected keys.Although cumbersome at first, you'll be able to make these combinations fast like in a fighting game. You'll learn the most useful combos not too long in the HUB world, and the puzzles allow for some failure. If you ever forget them, you have all combos listed in the pause menu.In-between the smaller, focused areas, the game has this ""HUB-world"" (which I use in quotations as there's nothing to do other than collect particles). Besides the optional fetch-quest, the area serves as a means for the player to learn on his/her own pace with the superflous amounts of quarks.All of these gameplay ideas sound wonderful on paper, and the tutorial isn't unclear for people not familiar with quantum mechanics nor too long for seasoned platformers. Unfortunately, the HUB areas are my main gripe with this game.Mechanics Are Best When QuantizedIronic enough, a game about quantum mechanics is the most fun when you set enough limitations on all the probabilities you can have. Only then do you see the game's potential.The procedurely generated layouts are a nice touch for replay value, but the HUB environments aren't interesting to explore as the only objective is to collect X amount of each particle.Thankfully, you do not have to collect everything. The only time you need to collect everything in the area is when the game has some arbitrary reason to get progress. The only other thing you need to keep an eye out for are the Charm Particles to finish the game.When you are in those ""dungeon"" areas with a limited amount of quarks (which is limited by the checkpoints) is where I think the game works best.The abundance of quarks offers no challenge to get around the generated HUB. At worst, it means you may have to backtrack if you cannot progress without one type of quark. At best, it makes for a tutorial at your own pace in disguise. This is almost a different game to when you're in the dungeon areas.When limited, you have to think how to make the best with what you got. You learn about some combos' synergy and how to better reserve each type of quark. The checkpoints enforced a difficulty scale rather than some arbirtrary impasse, and because I had so many spare quarks that means there are multiple solutions too.If the game was only of these dungeon areas and running-sections, then I think you'd have a well-loved classic. It would be a shorter game, admittedl, if there wasn't more content added in to compensate, but it more polished experience... Until the end boss.Nothing about that fight had anything to do with Schrodinger's Cat's mechanics. Why couldn't the game ended with something that fits the game's focus and its mechanics?Aside from a weak, annoying boss-fight and a game that took the focus away from what works, the biggest problem about Schrodginer's cat is its dumb smart humor.Want a formula for this game? Η(umor) (WH)Ψ? = i h(ate) to derive Ψ(our) timeI mean no disrespect to Team 17, but I cannot tell whether you hate your jokes or if you like how bad they are. I love bad humor, if done right, which this game does not. (And I know this is a subjective section. but it's the main thing that turns people away. Not the science.)For starters, most of these puns are not puns. At worst, they're nonsensical combinations of words. ""Scienterrific"", ""Phystasticular"", ""Coola-boola"", and ""Fists of Feyman"" (actually, I like that last one; keep it). Most of them are not funny. Combining physics/science-stuff words with other words is a really, really lame gag. And I think you know this.Second, references are not funny without giving some context/set-up first. Why should I laugh about the Schrodinger Equation or Einstein's energy equation of light/photons generated on the map? (Also, where are those photons anyway? And the neutrinos? And the gamma-rays? And all the other subatomic particles that could add in more puzzles and cool combinations?)I did at least enjoy one clever joke, the answer to ""Why do problems always come in threes?"", because the game set it up and the answer came at the right time for a good delivery. Not an explanation in the tutorial for how many combos there are represented by a series equation.The one thing this game taught me is that there is such a thing as dumb smart-humor. As another user stated,""The game is good and is not good. Only by playing will you find out."" Similarly, I cannot decide whether most of the game's ""jokes"" are self-aware of how bad they are or if they think all these one-liners are ""smart"" jokes.If Poe's Law could ever be applied to science, this game would walk that line and keep you guessing at every turn.Please Don't Skin this CatAs much as I'm giving this game a lot of flak on its type of humor, I think people are pushed away by it, not the gameplay itself. If the game's humor is grating to you, I would recommend trying this game on a discount. The gameplay doesn't take long to get into with the first two hours.I think the one-liner superhero Schrodinger's Cat doesn't have to change. He is amusing as a trope-heavy cliche when he is poking fun at himself and others. His design is a nice color-compliment scheme. I also like how detailed he is when you change his forward direction from left-to-right. (His color-scheme flips.)The Particle Zoo is a wonderful setting that captures the subatomic chaos of the microscopic world, if a little bland because of the reused textures and layout of the HUB world. I also felt some of the wierdness, though wonderfully expressed in the setting and characters, could've touched on things outside of the nucleus.For example, I would've liked to explore the electron-orbital paths in a spacey-manner with a quantum of energy, perhaps with emitting and absorbing photons. (And because you need specific energy values, you would have to solve some puzzle to get that solution.) That would be a cool QM puzzle idea and educational without being a boring lesson.With the quirkiness and seemingly endless potential for a subatomic world setting, I think the core mechanics could still be built upon what we have now for another game. Hopefully then, with a more focused game, we can have a great newcomer for platformers."

If only the game wasn't so buggy that it was unplayble. Quarks that were nessasary to complete the level would not spawn, enemies could jump out of the world to avoid me, and at high speeds I could clip through walls. A few patches are needed badly, but if the bugs are fixed this game would be worth the money!EDIT: no.As I breezed my way through the game, I realized that this game is not worth it. Having just finished the game, most of it was moderatly easy (with execption to the runner levels). However, the final boss and the ending cutscence were terrible. More glitches, more going through walls and overall more cheap deaths from the running sections really soured this game for me. Also the final boss was defeated using none of the mechanics I learned in-game, which is not how any game should end. I should also add that the recent patch didn't even fix a single bug (that I noticed).While the game has some redeming factors and a high framerate throughout (even when I cranked up the options) it was utterly a waste of my time."

,Not Recommended,295490,31069996,Posted: 10 April,all,BPDsauce,"I went into this game LOVING IT. Today, I'm so incredibly frustrated I hardly want to play ever again, but begrudgingly will to finish achievements at a later point. I will begin with positives.I really like the art style, I like the cool environments, and the physics-related humor is (mostly) top-notch. I enjoy the collecting without really having to collect mechanics, and I (typically) like the puzzles. The voice acting is also very good.Now, the negatives.This game is extremely buggy. I didn't have the same issues on my first playthrough of the game, but on the second, it was practically unplayable. I would fall through the floor of levels, I would glitch through walls, I would break the game so unbelieveably frequently that it really soured the gameplay. Also, with the puzzles being the way they are, there is so little room for error. If you make a mistake, even a small one, you have to re-do previous puzzling sections multiple times.These two factors, in my second playthrough, worked together terribly. I would glitch to parts of a puzzle that I wasn't supposed to be in, and despite having the pieces would have to restart. This kind of tediousness was horrible for me.My other main gripe is the use of a point of no return. I tried avoiding the point of no return at the end on my first playthrough, but somehow got stuck and ended up not being able to 100% the game, despite me being so close. This discouraged me so much, I didn't even finish.Now, on my second playthrough, I am rage quitting because at the second ""boss"" segment, the game refuses to give me the proper speed, so I am stuck in a loop of constantly dying. I have a hard time believing this is my PC's fault, because I didn't have this trouble the first time. So now, I can't even go back and complete the game like I wanted to.Gosh I wanted to love this game, and the first time I played it I did! But after this, I don't think I have the heart to even finish it. If you want to spare yourself the heartache of wanting to love a game but ending up hating it, avoid this game.
