76561198015337264,Not Recommended,295590,16526578,"Posted: 19 June, 2015",all,Rhev,"I MIGHT recomend this game with a caveat, please scroll to the bottom to see it, or better yet read the whole  review!(updated review posted below original)--Original review posted Jun 19, 2015--Just doesn't deliver.I wanted to like this game so much, I really did.  I liked the concept and I was hooked by the write up.  But it just doesn't deliver a fun and engaging experience.  The real and true fault to the game is that it doesn't do what the main hook of the game is delivered as.  The legacy system is really no different than a game reset in the long run.  In most roguelikes, you get a game over and maybe you've made some progress towards your next game.  In this one you have a limited number of turns, usually around 40 or so, and then the game forces you into and end scenario.  Often times you spend the last quarter of your life just trying to FIND a mate so that you can continue your legacy of mediocrity.So, it's billed as a ""roguelike/4X strategy game about life, legacy & love""4X ?  Maybe only in the very loosest of definitions.Do you 'explore' yes, you explore a bland and ultimately uninteresting proceedurarly generated world.  But once you explore the area, it doesn't change in future legacy characters.  HOWEVER the fog of war DOES reset.  So either hope you have a really good memory or ask yourself why the fog of war reset.Do you 'expand' ?  I would say no.  You don't really have any classic base or sphere of influence that you expand.  Oh you can upgrade other towns, but since they 'rot' over a generation or two, there's no sense of actual building or accomplishment.Do you 'exploit' resources?  Yes, ok, this is one of the 4 ""x""es that you actually do.  You kill monsters, loot mines, find artifacts, etc.Do you exterminate?  Kinda.  You fight monsters and other 'heroes' like yourself, but there's no sense of accomplishment because they are constantly respawning every generation.  So it's more like whack a mole, not exterminating any enemy.Have you found the common thread in everything that I've written yet?  It's that the legacy system is basically broken in my opinion.  There's really no sense of accomplishment or forward progression.  You spend 20-25% of your turns looking for a mate to try to continue your legacy instead of trying to do quests or explore, and then you start all over with a new hero.  After playing for 90 minutes, I felt like I'd accomplished absolutely nothing upon my new hero.I might give this game another go if they do a signifigant update to the legacy system, but otherwise it's getting banished to the 'never to be played again' list of steam games.  On the off chance that Heart Shaped Games LLC reads this:Get rid of building decay, have coins automatically carry over on each legacy, and maybe a percentage of the previous hero's strength and / or fame.  Otherwise the whole legacy system in it's current incarnation is nothing more than a soft reset.--updated review Oct 13, 2015--Sometimes it's a shame that you can only 'reccomend' or 'not recomend' a game when you write a review.  Because with the recent update, I really don't know if I feel like a  ""YES"" or ""NO"" is exactly how I feel any longer.Scott a dev from heartshapedgames was kind enough to take the time and write a feedback response to my original review.  Let me say first of all any dev who takes the time to listen to feedback and reviews and then try to make their game better is already leaps and bounds ahead of others in the industry.  That point alone scores major points in my book.But lets get to the game and the changes.  I will try not to rehash my original review too much and focus on the changes that I noticed in my play time.Pro:-Building decay, this is a NOTICIBLE difference from when I played last time and a very much needed change.  The buildings still decay, but picking up a hammer or the right trait, and you can really make your buildings last forever.  Ignore them and they will rot away in a little while.  That's fine.  It's not like you have to rebuild every year.-Items: I don't know if this is just my memory, but it seems like there was a slew of new items dropping from the last time I played it many months before.  Training swords, hammers, rafts... these items were in the game but I only ever saw them in shops before.  It's entirely possible that I just missed them somehow during the first few hours of my play, I don't know.  But it does have a positive effect.Con:-I was really hoping the legacy system would be boosted just a little.  Everything I said in my original review still holds true.  Gold doesn't carry over, nor does strength.  Fame does to an extent, in that your legacy once built up starts to build, but it's very small.  It's a bit disheartening to have someone with an epic legacy and their child is a no body.  Really the son of Grokthak isn't even at ALL famous?- Fog of war.  I really don't understand why this exists at all on each new playthrough.  I could almost understand if there was a 'semi' fog of war, a see through fog of war on each generation that obscured the monsters, but let you see terrain previous generations had explored.  But since the world doesn't change between generations, resetting the fog of war just makes the game feel tedious when I'm thinking ""now which town had the strength forts, and which had the farms?""- Age, I've actually changed my mind on the whole 'looking for a mate' at the end of your life.  Since your strength goes down in old age, that's when you should be retiring from adventuring and settling down to find a mate.  So my gripe about that has been removed.... unfortunately it's been replaced by something else.  The 'age' that you become an adult and gain a strength boost is fine.  But middle age, and old age, shouldn't be 'set in stone' they should be a portion of your maximum life.  Far too often I found myself effectively being forced into 'late game' by age for a hero because he hit a magical wall of age and lost a chunk of strength.  Now I understand that any game has to have a 'game over' situation, and in this it's not finding a mate before you die.  But I feel like pushing that old age penalty back a bit would be a bit better.  Let me have the choice for one last epic battle with the dragon thing before seeking out a mate if I want to risk the loss.  By making me lose 10 or more strength, I know I'm going to have next to no shot.ANYWAYS, wrapping up, I DIDN't change my review from a 'no' I would not recommend this game.  However, it comes with a caveat.--THE CAVEAT--Now, for the average player, based just on the description in the store page, NO, I would not recommend this game.  However, that being said, I WOULD RECOMMEND this game, BUT with a caveat;I would recommend this game as long as people know what they are getting into first.Despite what it says on the store page, this game ISN'T a 4x strategy game.This game ISN'T really a roguelike.This game ISN'T really about life, legacy and love.This game ISN'T really anything like Civilization or legend of zelda.But what this game is, is a unique and interesting twist on tactical rpg-lite gaming.  It's more akin to a board game than anything else in my opinion.  But it can be very engaging and quite fun at times.  Especially for the price, it's not a bad way to while away a few hours.I feel like this is a pretty solid game, though it could be better, and hope that heartshapedgames continues to improve upon it."

Don't expect to get much more out of the game, the game brings some fresh elements, and the whole generations thing is pretty cool.The game is a bit repetitive and short, and from what I can tell there is no real end to it. You can figure out exploitive strategies pretty easily then explore and kill everything. Once you have done that there is nothing left to do. No proper end for you either. Gives you a very empty feeling.Game is a bit buggy, and could have better flow; it feels a bit slow.Overall it's a bit hard to just say YES or NO to the game because is not bad though neither is it great. It's just an OK game. At the same time it's a unique experience, and if you want to play games that gives you new experiences go for it."

It isn't challenging at all, which is a problem for me since challenging gameplay should be the hallmark of a good roguelike. The game also lacks depth. Hero Generations is a game about grinding that goes nowhere. Each generation sets up the future success of the next generation - but to what end? If I wanted pointless grinding I'd continue my life as a software developer. It's pretty fun to play, but nothing about my brief playthrough makes me want to come back and continue playing.The combat is extremely tedious - actions that should take less than half a second (or be instant) like dice rolls end up taking longer.I guess it comes down to this:It's not a terrible game, but for the price I would have expected much more. Would not recommend you spend your money on this, there are much better roguelikes/lites available. EG: FTL, binding of isaac, dungeon of endless"

You have to within your heroes lifespan develop the kingdom around you by building structures within cities that wil boost your stats. This is all good but in a certain amount of years those buildings will collapse and the city will decline. So you find yourself constantly runing back and forth building, upgrading and reparing buildings.-Your inventory is very limited (only 2 spots) which makes questing a hinderence since you can't carry a weapon and shield while picking up an ancient statue.......-Again Random combat is always a negative, if you get your hero up to 40 str your hero has a 0-40 chance to inflict combat damage, meaning your char with 40 str can lose to a minon with only 1-2 strg. (ANNOYING)-Lifespan is to short, by the time you get your hero strong enough to adventure and build up cities he/she is middleaged. Since each turn your hero takes counts as 1 year, 80 footseps comes sooner than you think. I am only glad that my 80 year old female hero can still reporduce.If you want a quick mindless strategy game, pick this up on sale, if you want something more polished pass on this"

,Not Recommended,295590,15363895,"Posted: 14 April, 2015",all,RootPew,"A decent premise, marred by technical flaws.Major issues:Some Game-breaking bugs. Loading screens get stuck/crash, and tiles can become impassable at random. Needs a lot more QA.Resolutions are very broken. 1080p Max, windowed mode only; which often displays a 720p window. Causes the small text used in-game to appear blurry, and difficult to read.Some graphical anomalies, such as backgrounds/textures vanishing, requiring a restart.Info pane sometimes gets ""cut off"" at the bottom of the screen, letting you only read half of an instruction/info text.Gameplay/logic criticisms:Lives feel far too short, and stats are dictated almost entirely by dice rolls and random number generators. Subsequent generations of heroes lack any real feeling of progress as a result.Battles are fully dictated by dice roll/RNG mechanics; a lost battle feels far too punishing, taking away from an already short lifespan.Town/Structure building feels far too much like farmville/mobile tap-gaming. Re-visit tile for reward, re-visit tile to upgrade, re-visit tile to prevent building degredation.. with so few moves afforded per lifecycle, it feels like a forced grind to make your actual ""play"" session even shorter.Unless I'm missing out on a deeper meaning in the game's message, I'm quite sure two males cannot produce an offspring as of yet - or at least, not in a time period where train stations are a new invention. Name/appearance generation doesn't appear to pay any attention to supposed gender.While the idea is good, the execution unfortunately, is not. With some minor amounts of polish, and more QA, this title could have fared a whole lot better. If this were a beta/early access game, I'd feel it has promise.. but as a completed title, I would not recommend it."

Sure, there were plenty of negative reviews, but everything about this game seemed interesting. When I actually started playing it, I was disappointed.It's hard to say what the fatal flaw of the game is. Is it the pace? The reliance on random chance? Pointless buildings? Mediocre character designs? Or is it just the general lack of love that went into the game?Ultimately, this is a very average game. Buy the phone version if you really want to play it; I could see it being good for a mindless distraction while on the toilet. But on Steam, where there are hundreds of better games to choose from, it's hard to find a reason to recommend this."

But perhaps my expectations were wrong, because I was unfamiliar with the roguelike genre. I had hoped that this game would be more like a sandbox in which you can play out your own stories. However, there is no way to create interesting stories in it at all.You can marry to have children (in fact: you always only have one child and after that you die, and play on with the child). Besides the marriage itself, there is never any interaction between your character and the one you marry. There is never an interesting interaction between parent and child and friendship is non-existent.In fact it's just some simple economics: building, harvesting, killing, gaining loot. Marrying is also entirely an economical decision. I think if that is what you play it for, it's fine.In general I tend to dislike it, when games that pretend to be about adventure, are in fact only about economics and statistics. Wastes the theme for me."

It's a Rogue-like 4X-lite with novel approaches to the way it handles some of the systems and is definitely not more ""been there, done that"". I can't recommend this game in it's current state, however, because there is a major glitch that makes one of the core features frustratingly punishing: buildings, once erected, only last X amount of turns before they degrade and vanish unless you keep coming back periodically to repair them before this turn timer runs out. The glitch is that sometimes these buildings will deteriorate away whether the turn timer is over or not, which makes planning your buildings for future generations a dicey proposition as you never know if the buildings will last as long as they are supposed to or not. This is not a new glitch judging from the forums, Unless and until the glitch is taken care of, as the planning of buildings for future generations is a MAJOR part of the game, I can only recommend picking this one up if there is a really good sale going on."

The word is limited and once you've explored and cleared all 6 areas of your playthrough, there is nothing to do, as an area only refreshes when a hero is born in that area only.Also the only thing you have to strive for is fame. Yes, the life limit curtails how much you can get and you can strive for a high score, but once you've discovered and gotten the vampirism trait, you can extend your life almost infinitelly by simply attacking other heroes on the world in hospital areas. I managed to get a character to 200+ life expectancy by just grinding combat. At that point, you can take your fame as high as you want, as long as you can tolerate the immense grind. I reached 65k before I gave up.Get this game only if you can get it on a good offer."

While I would and do recommend the game on mobile, it´s a waste of money buying this on PC, the game gets very repetitive and your choices don´t matter that much in the long run, every action with a long-lasting effect eventually has a counter-action that cancels all the effort you´ve spent on the game. You´ll soon get tired of re-building, re-discovering, re-cleaning the dens and the devs, instead of offering something new for the game you´ve bought, create a ""new"" game that´s pretty much the same as the one you already have.

A good game if you're looking for an adventure-fusion game that's fast to pick up, but has challenge, and if you like experimental games.Hero Generations starts with a hero, who goes into the world, gains fame and gold and equipment, builds towns, and then dies.  Sure, the monsters may get you, but your real enemy is age.  Heros age and die, each turn is a year of their life, and that can burn away quickly.To build a legacy you can construct buildings, win fame, discover equipment, and find mates to parent the next generation of heroes.  As generations progress new buildings are unlocked, and as you build towns change and grow, and you can explore different worlds, each with something unique.  Quests are given in each world to give you something to strive for, but you'll probably have plenty of your own goals, from making specialized towns to getting to a particuarly inacessible area.The game mechanics are simple:* Move around the map.* Age and gain (or loose) abilities.* Find assorted treasures, monsters, items, and features.* Interact with those things in simple ways - combats, for instant, are decided by a single die roll.* Build around towns or upgrade buildings - which provide many benefits and can change the nature of towns.* Find a mate is impressed with your stats and parent the next generation.* Choose the traits of your child.* Lead the child on their adventure.Though simple on many levels, the game's strength is how elements interact.  Towns change their nature (and the mates available) depending on what's near them.  Different items afford different advantages.  Different buildings provide different bonuses or tributes.  As you play, you find more and more ways to benefit from the elements of the game and adventure deeper - there's always something new to explore.Its the kind of game to appeal to people who like to make long-term plans - literally generational in this case.Visually, the game has a very charming, cartoony style; bright colors, amusing characters with lots of variance, vibrant backgrounds.  It's got its own look which really makes it memorable and enhances the enjoyment.The greatest strength of the game is how it manages to be both simple to play and offer a lot of complexity at the same time.  Gameplay is very easy, almost casual, and fast to pick up - but the depth of the game requires thought.  Yes, you're controlling a cartoony adventurer, but when you experiment with creating specialized towns, or plotting how to build roadways all over the world, you realize just how complex the game can get - and yet it's still easy to play.If there's an issue with the game it's that some people might find it boring after awhile.  It yields its secrets to experimentation, exploration, luck, and persistence - and you may not exactly be up for spending three generations getting a town just right.  If that's your thing, good, but it may not be for everyone - the game's unusual fusion really is it's own thing.The game seems to have good support, and even after release the author is integrating feedback and improving it.  The game's definitely finished, but the author is open minded about improving it - or reversing a bad choice or two.I consider it a buy for fans of rogeulike, adventure, and planning/4x games who want something easy to play but with some depth.  You can figure it out fast, then enjoy the complexity it offers.I also consider it a definite buy for people who like to explore something experimental.  The game's cobination of elements, the way it implements them, is worth exploring for people that like to find something different."

However, as the updates rolled in, the game only got better. Content-wise it still has a little ways to go, but technically, Hero Generations improved; it got fullscreen, combat was quickened, gameplay in general became smoother.I really appreciate the developer for being dedicated to improving the game. A score of 65% positive? Unacceptable, this game is very decent, and that's being said with the fact that it can still be better! If you like a simple RPG with 4x elements, try this game out.

There's something magical about it - it's clearly the labor of love.The gameplay is simple, yet strategic. The graphics are simple, yet charming. The combat is simple, and yet again, tense with every roll.That isn't to say that the game doesn't have it's faults. With the simple traits, a lot is left to be desired in terms of content variety itself. Although you have quests, it seems that most of them are pretty much the same thing with different names. Inventory is too small for quest items, and overall, it's clearly under-developed at this point, so much that it would seem reasonable to put it under Alpha (not in a negative sense, but in a realistic sense).However, the developer replies to almost every concern brought up, and has already fixed one game-breaking issue with saves. If this trend of correcting bugs and adding future content updates, I have no trouble believing that he will continue to updating the game and making it the next smash hit on Steam.As of now, it's a 7.5/10, but with the future, I have no troubles beliving it could be a 9.5/10"

It has a solid tutorial and the core gameplay is easy to learn hard to master. Traits randomly passing down from both parents is an interesting mechanic and forces you to try and woo the best mate each generation. Also, buildings are named after their builder and age which gives the feeling that time is actually passing.Unfortunately though once you do master it you will quickly find that it isnt balanced particularly well. By the 3 hour mark I had found a way to cheese the game and become a 1000s of years old vampire living off the drained lifeforce of other adventurers. Kinda arguable who the real villian is in the game at that point. There are also a few glitches that still remain in the game that at this point I'm assuming are there to stay, they are not game breaking though so not a huge deal. Despite these negatives it was still quite a bit of fun for around 5 hours, but once you've killed and done everything there really doesn't feel like any reason to start again.TLDR: A simple but deep strategy roguelike that despite a few balance issues and glitches still managed to keep me entertained for around 5 hours, definitely recommend it to anyone who likes strategy games and roguelikes."

You'll get better as you go along and learn what works and how this and that works and when to go where and such, but luck and strategy are HUGE factors in this game.It looks to be from where I've gotten to that in order to beat the game you need to do most of your progress within one single generation, that generation will need to be some generations in as you'll need to work to building a strong foundation and do some exploring first, all of which takes many generations - some luck and some skill. The fountain of youth found in the meadows I think it was, would be really good for when you go to beat the game, but yeah,.... this game is pretty hard to beat.Anyway just gonna say it again I love this game and if anyone doesn't find this or other reviews to be helpful enough try finding this game on youtube, just keep in mind its a lot more fun to play than to watch, the gameplay is the selling point not the graphics.Peace."

I do not know why the reviews are positive overall, since I can't imagine enjoying this game past about an hour. The concept is incredible, and they have the framework for it, but it's terribly executed beyond that. There just isn't enough content, and some of the systems, like the item and trait system, feel rushed and don't make very much sense. It's like they had these huge ambitions, made the world system, which is very well-done, realized they didn't have time/money to do what they wanted to, and haphazardly put together the rest of the game.I don't ever write reviews, and don't care to explain in detail, but I think a thought I had repeatedly while trying to play Hero Generations sums it up quite well: ""Why did I just pay $10 for a crappy Facebook game?""EDIT 4/18/15: I still do not recommend this game for the time being, but the developer appears to be paying genuine attention to reviews like this, and it seems like they intend to address many of the issues that negative reviews like this brought up.

I knew I wouldn't be playing it long, but it doesn't take long for a person of skill to make everything literally seem pointless.The finding a mate part took a few generations to set up good. I've got 1 town that I breed in. That in itself is a problem, because it's in the starting area. Would it be hard to lock other points in another area? No, I'd just do the same build mechanics that guerentee a mate.Age is a nice concept. You get +10 strength at Adult and Midlife stages, then -10 strength at Old Age and Sage stages. So your old as sin hero is just as strong as your fresh kiddy outta mommy. I get it, but I'm pretty sure a 16 year old could stomp a 120 y/o (My max age when finding a mate) into dust.City building takes a few gens. Get use to it. Build houses right off the bat. Put more people INTO the city, you'll be able to bone one. Got a bad lineup? Go to another city. All else fails, just start over. Every generation is a learning process (until you hit my point).Now, the playthrough I have going now, nothing breaks down. Not because of a building, not because I have traits. I have an emerald hammer, had it since gen 2. 800 years repaired.... Nothing breaks, because I walk over everything every life, have to to get strong enough to kill the bosses. How am I doing that?Turn 2 cities into fotresses, one with STR boost building, one with Damage boost buildings. On a good kid, I can easily take 20 years off other adventurers before even hitting ""adult"" stage.Therein lies the issue. I'm a huge RTS nerd. TBS isn't all that different. So I build to withstand over time. The hammer was a lucky drop, whatever. I still bought it. There's traits to get that effect. The problem is the moving. I don't think it should take 8 years to travel from one city to another. You're sleeping half the time, wake up and move your♥♥♥♥♥ 1 year 1 turn? No. Kill the life boosters so a character can't live 120+ years. I killed 2 bosses in that life. With the frailty this game shows on its ""heros"" that wouldn't work. Problem is, once you figure out how to build, you can get your guy out by midlife and into big fights, smash the enemies, hit sage, return to your breeding towns and just bang a chick to get a kid. Got the Golden Child Trait? Set up to smash a LOT of critters cause you're OP from the start of that gen.So for a couple hours? Sure, waste the time. Got a bad memory? Fog of War killing your vibe? Got a phone? Take a picture every time you fully explore a zone. Why are people hating on this? Take notes, it IS a form of stratagy game.All in all, I'm a harsh critic. I enjoy a challenge, and this game doesn't deliver that past the first 30 minutes (I'm being extremely nice on that) I would have to give this a 4/10. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends, they enjoy the same super insane difficulties I do.

You have one lineage you try your best with. Fail to generate an heir and you're done for.But why can't I keep on questing while my mate raises my child? Every time you get any sort of stats, you can either retire early and thus lose them again, or keep being useful with a chance of your run failing. How do people even still exist if every couple can only procreate once?Everything seems so inconsequential. I apparently made my home town into a kingdom because I had 12k Fame. I couldn't make it back to my Kingdom, as my time was almost up. When I went to the Kingdom, it was already a Slum. What use is there in generating something fancy if you can't even see it once?But fine, that was because I didn't plan well. I trained far too hard, had about 100 str when I died. I should have gone for 60 str, then go after the 60 str boss. But you have to beat the boss three times! He can easily knock 30 years off of my life! Or 60! Or zero. Like every roguelike, playing high-risk is rewarded, as that is the only way to break highscores after some time. But it's also boring to fail runs in a row.So just plan ahead. Instead of beating the boss, buy high level gear, get a kid at the Fort, inherit good gear, and beat the boss early. Maybe. And if you DO lose too much time, that's it for that run. You won't see a Kingdom.RNG aside, as that is quite inherent to roguelikes, the music is meh and repetitive, and the animations just take so goddamn long. See 10 numbers fly by on the red star dice before saying what our strength rolls are. Show me my damage given/taken, which you already know way ahead, for 2 seconds more. Deal damage for 2 seconds more.It got worse when I got a +0-1 damage bone. Most of the times it didn't even matter, as targets have 5- hp anyway. But you lose 4 seconds more every combat, to see it roll a 0, and to then add 0 to a different number to not change it.SOBOREDAt least you have ""meaningful"" choices when mating. You flip 6 out of 25ish cards to determine your character. But the cards are face down. You see the type(but not strength) of 3ish cards. You don't have 25 choices. You have 4. Which of the 22 random cards you flip is not an option. It's waiting for the numbers to show. This is made worse at the aging Milestones, where you always see 4 blind cards and 1 typed card, flip one of them. This isn't a choice out of 5. It's out of 2.In this way, I'm bored just as with (unpopular opinion ahead) FTL. Sure, you can do stuff, but you don't have real control. If I find a derelict spaceship, the ""don't investigate"" option isn't really an option, I will have just wasted my time on nothing. This is quite the same: you have 20 life left, explore? Well yeah, sitting around is even worse. But if you get back after losing a battle, your mate might suddenly not want to be with you anymore.

And I like it, I think it's a lot of fun, it's sort of like a lite Roguelike and a Civilization game rolled up into a bite sized game.There are issues that kind of make you feel like you aren't making progress. For starters, there's a ""world disaster"" event in the game and the count down to it is far too short, you've barely just started playing when it makes itself known.Further, any upgrades you make around other towns degrade slowly over time, even with the black smith utility. What makes this frustrating is, there's not really a point to upgrading each ""world"" unless you intend to spend any extended amount of time there. It feels like wasted resources and can be aggravating.The random element of the combat can be frustrating; it's all based on simple dice rolls. And even if you have a ability of 200 and are fighting a enemy with an ability of 30, there's still a chance they'll beat you. There's gear and buffs you can get later on, that add on bonuses to your ability and strength, which helps a lot, but early on, it's a problem.The game isn't really polished all that much either. There's been a few glitches I've run into that is really frustrating. The first is that the game is supposed to save after every move, but several times now my save files decided to just delete themselves or become something entirely different. Another issue I've been running into is, suddenly the game just won't let me move or skip any turns. The game is still running, I can open the quest menu, I just can't move.The game needs a little more polishing, there's some mechanics that could really stand to be changed and there's a few bugs to squash, but besides that, the game is fairly fun and the price tag isn't bad.

Build up cities, kill monsters or do both at the same time. There are a few problems though. After every few moves the game auto saves. The delay is pretty noticiable. Even worse, The game is not able to load those saves when you close the game sometimes. So you could lose whatever work you've put into the game. But at less than $15 it's still a pretty decent time killer. It would probably do well as a mobile game."

I was drawn in by the good reviews and promise of unique mechanics, but I found this game to offer no meaningful decisions and the most boring combat system I've ever seen.  For something that's so simple (simple graphics and simple gameplay), why do I spend half my time on loading screens?This is the first game that I've regretted buying on steam in a long time."
,Not Recommended,295590,16529129,"Posted: 19 June, 2015",all,pamplemousse,"Entertaining concept; poor execution.Having played a little under an hour, the gameplay already got very repetitive. Combat is completely uninteractive, and amounts to a randomized speed bump either netting you a minor reward or reducing your character's lifespan. The age mechanic (+10 strength, then +10, then -10, then -10, every decade or so) is more annoying than interesting, and diversity between characters is... well, very bland. And playing the game I constantly felt like I was waiting for slow, awkward animations and transitions. There may be real depth here at some point, but not enough to slog through the initial tedium I felt, and certainly not for the $12 it cost on sale."

The game, most noticeably, lacks an apperent save system yet has a load game button; it saves your game if you x out the window. The game world is very tiny which along with the ui gives it the feeling and appearance of a mobile game or a pc game in late alpha or early beta. So for what it is it is an ok game and worth considering if they lower the price, and make the game world bigger.Oh and make the people have normal skin colors instead of grey or green."

I would suggest you watch some Gameplay videos though as I was not expecting the Gameplay to be like it is.Added Plus judging from the other Reviews the Devs seem to be pretty good at taking players opinions on board."
,Recommended,295590,15339074,"Posted: 13 April, 2015",all,Silva,"---Warning long review incoming---This is based only on a couple of hours in. Oh! My english is not that good, so it's possible you see some mistakes.That said, let's get into the subject. The game has an interesting concept. The mix of ""5 Minutes Civilization"" as the dev said and the ""Rogue-Like"" genre, with the mechanic of mating so you can build a legacy make the whole idea interesting. The devs wanted the game to be accessible to everyone, so the game may be a bit simplistic.What is the result?Well... they managed to do something good, but i'll be honest, it's not the indie game of the month. You start in your village, and go fight monsters, build improvements to nearby towns so when you move on these tiles you get bonus (like more Strength, more Lifespan, Gold, etc.)You get quests as you go to other worlds, and you have a main quest too. So, you have your objectives, now it is up to you to find how you are going to accomplish them.The fact that they made the game accessible to everyone makes the game way too easy for harcore gamers, or some devoted gamers in general. The casual gamer type will find some fun, or even our kids or just new gamers.I don't want to spoil anything because there isn't much to discover in the game and it will destroy ""the magic"" if I tell you everything right now. Let me do a quick Pros/Cons list, so you'll have a better idea about the game.Pros___-Beautifull art-style. Simplistic, but still nice.-Nice music. Yeah... it's good.Now the real stuff-Good mix of genres (Simplistic 4x + Rogue-Like)-Friendly game that anyone can play-Interesting RPG system with the gear limit (2) , the traits you pass down, etcNeutral----Simplistic (i think i said that word a couple times now)-Easy-The art style, depends on your tastesCons----Too easy for the more dedicated gamers (way too easy for hardcores)-Doesn't have much content (not enough gear, traits, worlds, monster types)-Feel sometimes like a pocket game you would play on a phone or tablet-A girl named Bob, a boy named Josephine... -.- Seriously Heart Shaped Games LLC please fix your name generator (sorry for all Female Bob and Male Josephine out there)-Only 1 save slot-A ""Main Menu"" button would be nice by the way-More screen resolutions needed-Fullscreen and Borderless FullScreen is missing-What is this volume setting? It's like my phone. Make a slider or something please.-Fights are ful RNG based (My hero have 40 Str, my oponent 10, I roll a 6 he roll 8, he wins the fight and hit me with 5 damage, so i lose 5 years of my life)-Somehow overpriced (here it's 16,99 CAD$ full price, so i think $14,99 USD. Maybe if it was $9,99 USD (around 11 or 12 CAD), it would be more worth the money.And there is more i'm pretty sure, but i'll stop here because the rest is my personnal opinion, and it doesn't count right now.I heard this somewhere and I can't find who said that, but it's a very good way to think about games. Each dollar spent on a game should be worth one hour of fun. So in this case, the game must give you at least 15h of good time. Well, even if I found the game to be very easy, I still think  I spent some good time on it, because it was a relaxing experience. Sometimes, easy games are fun, even for more hardcore gamers.So, overall, I still recommend this game. But keep in mind that it's a small game for the public. So don't buy it if you want intense combats, deep strategy and complexity. This is really what the devs call it. a ""5 Minutes Civilization"" with Rogue-Like elements.This was Hero Generations.My personnal rating: 7/10Worth buying at: $11.25 USD or less."

Unfortunately I find that it's not a game I'm particularly fond of. I found myself bored within an hour, and unable to find many ways to build a sustainable dynasty, or achieve much at all. At very best I could defeat one easy boss in a lineage, and then once that lineage ends you have to start over in a completely new world, so any progress you managed to make is now gone.I've never been as strategy minded as some in these kinds of games, so I'm sure there are people who would do a much better job of this game than I. Personally, while I love the art, the game was not for me, and isn't one I'd recommend to friends."
