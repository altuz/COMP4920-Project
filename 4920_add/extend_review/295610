I suppose you can call this game a ""metroidvania"" in the same sense that a half-empty parking garage is a metroidvania. Sure, you have complete freedom to wander back and forth between a wide variety of drab-colored largely uninhabited levels that all look the same, but nobody would ever mistake it for entertainment.Honestly, the game was more fun at the beginning when falling more than a few feet at a time killed you. At least that made some of the mindless jumping between platforms bits a bit more challenging. Apparently ""adventure style puzzles"" actually means ""and now your player comes to a gap that can only be jumped if you nudge forward until you have approximately one pixel of sprite box left on the ledge,"" and failure doesn't result in death, you just fall back to the beginning of the level and have to loop back through three stories of tedious ladder climbing.Eventually you do pick up a few more weapons and powers, but what's the point when 99% of the game is wandering around empty terrain, occasionally shooting a bunch of identical monsters in the face and ducking to avoid their bullets?"

I never took any health damage except at the start of the game before you get the upgrade to negate fall damage.The game claims to be a metroidvania game, but in truth it's completely linear. The optional areas- which contain nothing except suit energy you don't need- only serve to make you waste time walking back and forth.Basically, the entire game is fighting trivial enemies that are no threat, doing annoying platforming, and then the game abruptly ends before anything interesting happens.The game's ""ending"" is an anticlimax that felt like the developer just got bored of the game and decided to end it half way through.=========== SPOILERS BELOW ================Yes, we all know that video game protagonists always manage to heroicly save the day despite a single person defeating hoardes of enemies being completely implausible. There's a reason that games are like that. ""Ending"" the game by having your character walk into a room and then die through some ambiguous explosion or earthquake or a ship falling on you or whatever that was isn't some novel idea. It's just an annoying anticlimax that makes the game feel incomplete."

It's a couple hours long and it's worth your time if only for the feelings you're left with at the end. If you want a metroidvania that lets you run and gun and hits all of your pleasure centers, this is not the game for you and in your case I cannot recommend it.This is a game that will leave your jaw slightly agape as you wonder what the ♥♥♥♥ just happened.

It's a Metroidvania with TONS of more depth, replayability, challenge and fun. If you've all but exhausted all the games that have this style of gameplay (are you for real?!)

76561198016248854,Not Recommended,295610,10602282,"Posted: 21 June, 2014",all,DeslaSlade,"The initial storyline is engaging.  You are a member of what seems to be a security team for some large coorporation dispatched to a planet by the boss himself.  Upon arriving you are shot down (technically forced to use the escape pod) by the company's arch rival.  Your comrads are dead and you must find a way to send a distress signal and get off the planet.  As you investigate deeper into the planet you discover that there is more at stake than losing a dig site to your rival company.The gameplay is fun and the controls are good.  The game itself is reminiscent of a watered down version of metroid where you have essentially an open world to explore and advancing is controlled by what powerups you have so far.  That said, there aren't that many powerups total and the enemy diversity is minimal.  There isn't anything which I would call a boss fight.I've seen that some complain about no map and no music.  I admit, music would've been nice but its absence does provide a certain tension that is condusive to the games atmosphere.  Having no map makes me think of those old games of yore (NES that is) where one had to draw one's own maps and keep track of where you were going.  From that perspective, I like the no map option.  It is a different kind of game design that stems from giving players value in a game by making it more difficult.So finally, would I recommend this game?  Well, the story builds and I was very excited to see how they would end it but ufortunately the ending was, in my opinion, the equivalent of a book ending with suicide.  It is like the authors couldn't write their way out and so went with a very unsatisfying solution.  Maybe I just didn't get their point but sadly, it was enough to make me feel as though my time spent playing was in vain."

I liked the power ups I like the bleakness of everything made you feel like you really were there. I even liked the story however only up until I gotto the ending if you can call it that. You just goto sleep on a big stone slab and you get a message about real heroes dont have an audiance watching them when they are being heroes. Thats it after your read that message the game ends. Completely ruined what was a decent game. Honestly they could have still done this but after giving you  a real ending. I don't know whether the writer just couldn't think of an end or they just didn't want to code it or whatever it is game makers do. So yeah it was an ok gameuntil well magentic realms tried to getto artsy or just phoned it in.

The ending is pretty rough--and attempts to cover its lack of completeness with a long quote. It takes about an hour to beat this game and it involves little more than running back and forth shooting cookie cutter enemies. I think it's a nice concept game--but I would argue it's not worth the $5--maybe $1-$2.  I think it shows he developer has a lot of potential but unless you're interested in trying out a quick indie concept I would pass or find it for cheaper as part of a bundle.

Okay !To put it simply, take a 2D metroid, like Zero Mission. You have it? Good.-Now, remove the ability to move while shooting. Also remove the ability to shoot up and down. While you're at it, also remove the ability to LOOK up and down.-The varied gadget? Forget them, and replace them by keys. Make sure your key doesn't look like a key. Use an ID card, a dagger, a necklace, whatever.-The different weapons? Remove them, and keep only a lame weapon who does pathetic damage, or a shotgun who drains the shield.-The enemies? Forget them, just make a bunch of humanoids monsters, give them different colours to give the impression there's a couple of them, and have them patrolling in a platform. -Later, you may add flying enemies, because shooting constantly moving enemies with a gun that can only fire straight is fun.-The music? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA there is no music at all in that game. The only noises you hear are the character's grunts, the gunshot, and the monsters' moans.-The main character? Take Samus's combination, put Old Snake's face on it, try to add some backstory, fail pathetically, and decides he won't comment on anything he sees. Including soldiers from other factions cooperating with the local monsters.-The graphism? Well, it's pretty good. COMPARED TO ""ANOTHER WORLD"". THE OLD ONE.-The inevitable backtracking? Make it more boring by having most rooms being just a corridor with two exits, and REMOVE THE MAP.I honestly do not suggest it. 20 years ago, it would have been good, now it's almost insulting. You can find better games for free on the Internet.For the sake of honestly, I must admit that you're warned about the graphisms on the store's page.I personally think it's an excuse (of the ""it's ugly, but it's on purpose, it's a reference!"" kind), given that, on the same page, they try to sell that game as horror/metroidvania.You know, I don't consider myself attracted to games just because they're beautiful. But I think it's extremely hard to make a scary game when all monsters look like giant pixellated feces.That other game, Alone, I think, where a guy with a breathing mask tries to survive, was way better. Because there was lights tricks, some area were darker than others, and monsters actually looked like something, and there was sounds and music to create an ambience where you expect things to pounces you and scratch your face until you look like a chile con carne.In that game, I don't know if I'm shooting a giant pile of goo who looks like a human, or if I shoot zombies with crystals in their backs. Add to that the RIDICULOUS death animation (a small flash, usually used for teleportation instead of death), and you have a game where it's impossible to be scared.And another complain about the monsters : some of them spits fireball.Except that there's no animation for that. They just walk, randomly cough a fireball at your face, and turns around. And that's not the worse thing, the worse thing is that, to avoid that fireball, you just duck.Yes, that's the main problem with that game, each time you meet a zombie/mutant/whatever, you stop walking, you crouch, and you spam X until the monster is dead.Until you understand that it's more interesting for you to ignore the small fry and just shoot the mooks, since they're the one dropping energy for your shield.And have I mentioned that the game is a maze, and that there is NO MAP?I said no map? Have I also mentioned that there is NO INVENTORY EITHER? Good luck figuring out what that thing you just picked was if you were busy staring at something else than your computer screen."

,Recommended,295610,10307045,"Posted: 31 May, 2014",all,Love&Crossbones,"Part of me wishes this was longer;  but it really is just the perfect length for what it is.  I really like this buy for five dollars.If you hear the ""Metroidvania"" tag and expect something along the lines of Super Metroid, Fusion, or such, you may be disappointed - the MV genre is the closest easy genre to throw at it, but this is something a little different.  It's less like a modern era Metroidvania throwback, and more like a Metroidvania era Amiga throwback.Compared to what one expects from an indie MV style game, it's simpler in many ways, but with a little more push on narrative.  I'd really like to see what the fellow making this can do with a few more resources.It's stripped-down approach, while it may just be an artifact of the single-dev approach, is quite suiting to the game.  It comes across as slightly haunting, really.  It's like a really good indie record from the 80's - rather than being hindered by it's limitations, it has embraced them into part of the aesthetic, and made something better for it.  I think trying to make a game with the same sort of emotional resonance that is attempted in modern titles, within the confines of a vintage-styled 2D game, and to succeed on the level this game has is quite the accomplishment.From a gameplay aspect, while I often like something in this genre with a more open and less linear map (Aquaria was one of my favorites in this regard) given the size of this game, and the slow speed of movement, I appreciated the ""looping"" nature of many of the paths you take - while it does create a slightly more linear experience, it removes a lot of the ""grind"" of making your way across repeated terrain.  Teleporters and shortcuts and other work-arounds wouldn't have worked as well with the feel of this game, really, and allowing the character to move through the environment faster would have ruined the feel and mood of the game.Really, there's been an incredible balancing act in a lot of aspects of this game.   Every decision in it's creation seems to be quite deliberate.Honestly, I have a hard time not recommending this to anyone - the dollar and time cost are low enough to not feel like a waste even if you don't like it, and it's an intriguing game.  It doesn't quite hit every note it reaches for, but if you like 2D styled games, and games driven slightly more by story than action (without being action free) this is a good try."

I certainly did.I will tell you now, that you will likely be disappointed. The game itself is not terrible, though it doesn't really standout, or even stand-up to those old classics you may have played and thoroughly enjoyed. You will probably not get that proper feeling of nostalgic satisfaction, as this game does not have much in terms of content, no real upgrades, and very few secret or 'extra' things to find, which in my mind is the core part of any metroidvania game. None of the sort of hidden things are cool, or interesting. There are also no bosses. That's right, you simply fight the same enemies throughout the game with no real challenge, no climaxes.The story itself is ok, but the final nail in the coffin of this game is the ending (no spoilers)...you essentially suffer through some bad level design, and ok gameplay to reach what you hope is some sort of epic, or at least intriguing/satisfying conclusion...instead what you get is, not a bad ending, not an unexpected ending, or dissatisfying ending storywise...no, what you get, is essentially an insult for finishing the game. It informs you of something that most of us already know about playing video games in general. It has nothing to do with the game. I have to say that with that ending, this was in fact the most dissatisfying gaming experience I have ever had. That is saying a lot. I have played thousands of games over the years, and plenty of them were not very good. But the ending to this just leaves an absolutely bitter taste in your mouth. I have to say, I beleive that is exactly what the developer intended.Don't bother spending a cent on this, unless you enjoy torturing yourself."
