Easy learning curve, great graphics for the price and you can see that the developers have put real thought behind the gameplay and emerging dynamic, as it does get hard even on EASY and you need to think about what your are doing with placements.Great Game 9/10 in this price point."
76561198263427469,Not Recommended,295630,35106473,Posted: 21 September,all,Rurik,"Engaging TD game with very bad UI, explanations and diversity.I don't remember when and why I bought this game. I suppose it's connected with the awesome preview and good rating (Very Positive 85%)First of all, the preview of the game is a lie. ""Stunning Detail of levels"" - there is nothing stunning. ""in-depth gameplay"", actually, the TD elements at this game are bare to bones; ""finely tuned balance of all levels and turrets"" - ""The balance is bad. See below for more info"".I don't like when people lie.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1139880749Let's talk about gameplay. There is only 8 towers. Each tower has 4 levels. When you upgrade a tower it gets x2 damage and small attack radius boost. Each tower gets Hellfire ability (which is the same for all towers except Tornado), which increased attack fire by 200% for 5 seconds. That's all. There is no buyable abilities, there is no tech tree for towers. There is nothing else except these 8 towers.The balance of towers is bad. There is 1 overpowered tower, the Mortar, which has long range, high attack damage and splash. So, the tactic for all levels are simple. Place cheap tower, save money for Mortar, place mortar, upgrade mortar, when save money for the next mortar. Repeat until 30 wave is done. Add some lasers for air waves and some ice towers for better mortars' performance. All other towers has much lower DPS than mortar. I tried to pass 4th map on hard 10+ times to realise that.This is the second huge flow of Defense Zone 2. There is a lack of information. You can see the damage and attack range of tower. You can't see attack speed, attack type, dps, splash, bounce count and etc. An it's really bad. There are tip in the game loading screen which says ""Build your defense depending on enemy units"". Ok I go to tower info and see, that this tower does extra damage to Light units. But what are light units at this game? I can't select enemies, I can't check their HP or type.... tthttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1139880724As I said each tower has Hellfire ability. It should be interesting. But you need to manually use for each tower ( you need to select tower, and click at the button). At the end of the game you have 20+ tower and you are forced to click on towers and activate abilities. I played on Mac with touch pad and I was really tired to do these repetitive actions. TD is supposed to be about strategy and not about ability activationThe graphic is.... average. I think this game was originally designed for phones firstly. You can't visually discurn levels of towers. Level 2 of tower looks like Level 1. And it's bad feature.Let's talk about enemies. There are infantry, air forces, vehicles and tanks. And I had no idea which unit is stronger and which is weaker. You just start new wave and praying that you have enough damage to eliminate current wave.Bosses in this game just a bigger tank with more health. I forgot to say. Enemies don't have any abilities at all. They just have health, move and diehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1139880333Pros- 31 levels- Cheap game. There are discounts often- No bugs were foundCons- A lack of diversity in towers- Average balance between towers. Some are overpowered. Some are useless- Lazy concept of waves. They are all the same. Start with infantry, then vehicles come, then tanks and mega tank as a boss in the end of game...- No information about game mechanics. You can't see health and type of enemies, you can't see attack speed and calculate DPS for your towers- Game requires a lot of clicks. Especially on hard, because you need to use Hellfire ability constantly (each tower has this ability)- Graphics are average with a lack of explanation about power of towers and enemies (you can't visually understand who is who)ResumeI think, I could be funny to play this game in 2012, but in the 2017 Defense Zone is too outdated. You can find better TD titles for the same price with deeper strategy elements, so I can't recommend it."

Slow them down, hit them with the big guns. Toss in a couple lasers for airplanes. Hellfire the final wave. Rinse and repeat.Enemy variety comes in the form of airplanes or ground units. Ground units may look different, but the only real difference is how much health they have. All of the turrets are effective against all ground units, it's only a matter of concentrating the most damage into a small of a space as possible. Not all that hard since 6 of the 8 weapons hit multiple targets.This is a very vanilla tower defense game. I won't say it's bad, but it's not that great either."

I'm waiting for it to go on sale.In the mean time, I picked up Defense Zone 2. It's a fun diversion. Nice grafix, and  music.The gameplay is fairly open, and you find out sooner or later, if your stratigies will fail or not.I am new to this genre, and it is a nice balance of action and relaxation.I can see where this can be exciting/ challenging to play for all sorts of people, who no longer have the fast reflexes needed to win arcade style, scrolling shoot em' ups! Nice Job developers!"
76561197983740996,Recommended,295630,33657717,Posted: 19 July,all,Chane,"Defense Zone 2 is a very interesting tower defense game. There are eight type of towers, that of course can be upgraded. Speed can be accelerated to 2x and 4x. The game allows you to pause, while still being able to manage your towers, which is very helpful and necessary because Defense Zone 2 is a very difficult game.The game has 31 levels and each level can be played in easy, normal and hard difficulty. You start each level with 20 lives, which means 20 enemies may exit the map before it's game over. If you manage to survive without losing a life, you collect an achievement. So the main goal of the game is to collect 93 achievements, one for each level and difficultly.This however is easier said than done. Hard difficulty is quite extreme on all levels and the final levels can hardly be won in easy mode. So the game offers quite a challenge.Nevertheless it's a lot of fun to test your skills. As many other tower defense games, the game is very addictive. Whenever you lose a life you immediately want to start over to try again.In order to win you need to analyse each map, perfectly place your towers, and use the correct timing for hellfire, a special attack mode each tower offers for a short period of time. Towers can be placed freely and sometimes a few millimetres can mean the difference between victory and defeat.Pros:- nice graphics- very good music- great sound effects- pause mode that allows you to command towers- 1x, 2x and 4x speed- keyboard shortcuts- upgrading towers increases their strength significantly- towers can be adjusted to fire at nearest, weakest or strongest enemy- enemy ground and air troops- several lanes- several exits- several entry points- enemies in different directions on same lane- option to save your progress for each level and each difficulty in the game (very helpful!)- air strikes- cheapCons:- no story- some players might find the game too difficult- enemies often escape because your towers don't fire at them, aiming at other enemies instead. This can be very frustrating.- winning all levels on all difficulties seems almost impossible"

And the developer likes to play hide and go seek with your save game, he hid it in the windows registry, lame developer.If you want to delete your game file good luck, first you'll have to run a search and then edit your registry 'cause this developer could not take the time to do it right like every other game made."
,Recommended,295630,17837958,"Posted: 1 September, 2015",all,Vejita,"At first I must say I can`t confirm any technical Problems with this game. Although the Game places your Window not in Full screen Mode when you select windowed Mode and your Monitors Resolution. It puts the Game in an actual Window. But that’s not a Bug, it`s only sort of inconvenient.Defense Zone 2is a Standard Tower Defense Game (don`t need to say what you do in a Tower Defense Game). It`s a lot like Defense Grid. If you liked those Games, you properly like this one too.But in contrast to DG, DZ2 has 31 Vanilla Levels + it`s much more Difficult. There are 3 Settings, whereas on the last Level ""easy"", is already an achievement.There isn`t much more to say about this Game, except that the Levels only vary in the form, that they ramp up the difficulty and add more simultaneous Lanes + Multiple Air Lanes and tougher/faster Walker. In Addition you got a neat Overload function in every tower. It keeps you on your toes, because it can get you out of though spots. But it needs to charge and triggered manually, so you can`t just do fast forward all the time.Pro:PriceDifficulty / Difficulty SettingsEasy to learn, hard to masterContra:The Game is nothing special (but must it?)For that Price it`s a bargain (don`t wait, it will not get discounted further. Already waited). Really solid Tower Defense Game that will get you some nice Gaming time.It`s really nice to play while you’re doing something else on the Side, like watching a Film."
