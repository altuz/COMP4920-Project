,Not Recommended,295670,32642334,Posted: 22 June,all,pebl,"Honestly, I wish this game was better.It's got a great artstyle and I can see it being very, very fun. However it gets extremely repetitive very quickly.  With a lack of variety in enemies it's not as fun as I first thought it would be.It's pretty fun with friends for a bit but it's really not worth it. I've asked the developers if any new features were going to be added in the game and they've replied that the in-game features are complete.The games levels known as Hives have only a couple of themes. Electric, Ice, Fire and Poison. There all have slight changes and one enemy change.I've got 9 total hours in it simply because I've gotten bored from it quickly."

If I had one complaint, it would be that I wish there were more cosmetic options; there's only four skins (five if you're a kickstarter backer) and I can't tell the difference between the starting skin and the last one you can unlock. I would love some armor designs that reference great classic sci-fi games, like OldCom or Doom, though I understand they can't do perfect representations for legal reasons.My extremely minor nitpick aside, I wholeheartedly recommend this game. Most of the weapons are fun to use and of the two that aren't, one states in the codex it's meant for co-op play (the cryo beam) and the other is probably fun if you have other Jumpers to cover you (the Mag rounds; it just fires too slow for solo play. It's the only weapon I died on the first floor of a hive with.) The grenade types are varied and the utilities are all useful. My current build is E.U.V. Beam, Healing Grenades, and Overshield, and I can usually clear Arcade mode on Medium; I've even solo'd a Queen difficulty run with this set-up.The graphics are great; they remind me of a good DS title, and there's usually very little visual confusion. There are a few different types of enviroments with their own brand of hazards and their own unique stage boss every three or so floors of a hive, with the possibility of a floor being an ambush floor or a dark floor which has a variant itself - a rather dangerous one. As for power-ups, you can collect yellow goo to power up your guns and unlock new grenades and utilities, as well as find relics in boxes and challenge rooms that give a few bonuses such as increased max health or faster movement.Speaking of movement, this twin-stick-shooter controls very well. You have a jump with a limited flight extra jump to navigate, as well as a standard walk that's fast enough that I didn't mind a lack of sprinting. I didn't have a problem with aiming exactly where I wanted with the analog sticks, but if you do, you can use the laser sight utility to get a clear line on where your shots are going to go.In my time playing I only encountered one bug: in the ice levels, sometimes when you're running along the ice and you hit slightly raised solid ground such as a ramp, you will glitch into the enviroment. It's easy enough to get out - you just have to move around a bit - but I can see how this would be annoying and could potentially get you killed.Overall, I highly recommend."

And i can imagine it will be awesome with some friends. Bosses are badass. And the game is pretty chalenging at first untill you learn some upgrades and get some buffs. Works great on controller, and can't wait to play it more..I will add more to the review once i play it a bit more"
,Recommended,295670,29370426,Posted: 19 January,all,dna.noodle,"TLDR is that this game is really fun and has a ton of awesome weapons. I haven't even gotten to play the multi-player yet, which is where this game must certainly shine, and I still think it's great. Very easily worth $20 if you like blowing up tons of aliens with your friends.Pros:Good spritesGood actionTons of weaponFun weapon conceptsTons of enemies to destroyCons:I haven't been able to get through matchmakingPossible con:It's hard to tell so far, but balancing seems to be a little off. The poison cloud weapon is incredibly powerful, for example. Meanwhile the sniper rifle seems worse in all ways from what I can tell. I don't mind so much because I find there's good variety in how the weapon loadouts play, and they're all fun to use. It's also not fair to the game/devs that I'm judging these weapons in solo play because of course high damage AOE dots will be more useful in solo play than a sniper rifle. Still, the fastest I got through a level was when I used the poison cloud and explosion upon respawn setup to corpserun my way through a hive. I didn't have to do almost anything more than fire constantly and run to find my way through.And of course there are other difficulty modes that might negate this ""possible con"" as well. But that doesn't matter because the game is fun, well-made and different from other games and you should buy it."

I love the randomness of the levels and progression of difficulty. I've only touched the surface of diff weapons/items and can already tell it's been well thought out.

Jumping into this game, you won't expect much. You will see the side scrolling and expect another twinstick shooter. Well, I can tell you that you will be quite surprised, as the game will quickly remind you just how hard twinstick shooters can be. The enemies come in waves and you cannot pause this game, so be prepared for the long haul of finding the exit!Bonus rooms are just as brutal. Some disabling your jump jets and others with wacky elements added to them, I'm lookin at you bouncy electric room. Just when you think you've cleared all the bug spawns out, in comes another wave of them. In the time you spend looking for the buggers, you normally lose most of your life. This game is a roguelike, so death is final. However, there is a twist. Your main HP is linked to your backpack. This controls your respawns of new jumpers to take your place and on Singleplayer, it is quite forgiving. You can move the pack when you die and keep it out of harm's way until you respawn.However...on multiplayer, where you die is where it sits. So it is up to the other players to snag the bag and keep it safe until you respawn. If both players die, the bag will fall to the ground, into acid, into lava, etc. Depends entirely on where you are when you pass on and the enemies swarm it. Once your respawns are up...you will be seeing the ever familiar ""Mission Failed!"" Fear not though! You get to keep your earnings(Most of them) and upgrade to try again with a better aresenal. Like I said, I normally don't write reviews and this was more of an explanation of what kind of game this is, rather than what I feel about it.So, what I feel about it? It is awesome. Sidescroll Helldivers with endless waves of bugs. Loves of EDF or Helldivers will love this game. Grab a buddy, keep that bag safe and save the world!"

Gunplay is a blast, platforming is fun, bugs have just the right amount of squish for that ""mowing down the horde"" feeling. Weapons and equipment have the perfect spread for every kind of playstyle. Game also looks surprisingly good, which is strange to say with such a straightforward design.The biggest surprise, however, was finding out BigGiantCircles did the music. I never knew he'd gone on to official work, but his talent really shines here. One of the absolute best OSTs for a game I've ever heard, with every single track hitting the mark in mood and energy.If we ever do go to interstellar war with giant bugs, I'd say we'd need BGC to compose our anthem, except he already has."

,Recommended,295670,29659002,Posted: 2 February,all,lunarwhaler,"When I first picked up Hive Jump, I messed around with it, felt there wasn't that much to it, and considered refunding it. Then I unlocked some weapons, tried out the campaign mode, tried some more builds... and here I sit, 14 hours later and still happy to jump some more. It's repetitive, sure - but that core gameplay loop itself is VERY entertaining, the guns are fun and varied, and the randomization provides enough spice to keep you going back for just one more jump.There are some problems, sure - the online could be better, and some of the weapons are distinctly less useful than others (lookin' at you, Cryo Beam) but the devs are responsive on the forums and actively working on fixing things up. Don't let multiplayer hold you back - the game is fantastic in single player, and local multiplayer works great as well.Would fall from heaven and fight like hell again."

It scratches every single gaming itch I have, from progression to manic platform shooting to extremely awesome music.  It also runs great and has all of the necessary PC gaming options.The Dev. team has been hardworking and very caring over this project - which I expect from folks living in a city with great BBQ, but is rare in modern gaming.  No doubt they'll take this already great product and make it even better as time goes on... not that it needs it."
,Recommended,295670,28994472,Posted: 3 January,all,JamesMcNasty,"Hive Jump is like Contra had a baby with Metroid, but the Dad was actually Usain Bolt.The gameplay is fun, fast, and frenetic, but some nicely implemented mechanics keep it from being overwhelming. The current mode available, Arcade, plays like a rogue-like, with death ending your run, but any goo (money) earned can be spent toward various unlocks for your next run. The action is further tempermented by the ability to use a jetpack after you initial jump, so you can maintain some distance from the bugs before being overwhelmed.I think the best mechanic for this game is that you can die as much as you want. Each death simply results in a new clone being teleported to your location via a backpack that you carry around. When you die, that backpack is open to attacks from the bugs though, and when it's gone that's game over.Overall, what's here is great, and I'm really looking forward to seeing what they do with the full campaign mode. I highly, highly recommend it with some buddies. It's one of the few good games with honest to god couch co op, and it works really well.Support these guys, buy the game."
,Not Recommended,295670,29883110,Posted: 12 February,all,T-Bone Biggins,"I wish there was a middle neutral rating, not good not bad. I'm going to lean towards a no at least for now, devs are good and keep updating the game so maybe my complaints will be resolved in a later patch.I love Contra. Played Contra 1-3 on NES and SNES since I was 3. I loved Starship Troopers the movie during my childhood. I thought this game would scratch that itch well, but in the end it frustrates at least as much as it pleases.Yes, I do Contra speedruns. Yes, I am good at scrolling sideshootes. This one has some cheap deaths due to the close-in zoom and I won't sugarcoat it. I think that is the biggest problem this game has. During queen fights it zooms out and that feels alright, you can see enemies from a fair distance and get a lay of the land. Here if you want to move with any speed you will run into kamikaze bugs, have your jump-jet interrupted and shut off because some creature you couldn't see 'knocked' you then you fall into a hazard, stuff like this. The utility slot is wasted if it's not used on an Overshield so balancing required on that front. I like to have low health, but not when you literally cannot see what is coming and back to the zoom issue for combat and navigation.Other issues bug me, certain cheap enemies like the stalker and me spending days trying to find a random match without any success just all adds up to an experience that is more frustrating than fun. I really hate to say this, but my main gripe about the zoom level seems to be something that will stay as a dev has stated in the forums before zoom is going to stay where it is due to beginning design decisions in the dev process. The devs are awesome, don't get me wrong, they frequent the forums and are upright fellows. Not going to cast aspersions on them in any way, there are just a few minor things would nudge me into leaving an enthusiastic 'yes' instead of a hesitant 'no' on the Steam reviews system."

Now that I can finally play it myself, I must admit......It's fantastic.I'm a sucker for everything this game is: Mega Man-esque killer tunes, roguelike features, couch multiplayer, challenging 2D platforming, incredibly vivid pixel art, and the list goes on. The jump packs make you feel slick and the guns make you feel powerful.I've only played single player so far, as the online multiplayer isn't here yet. Yet, this game will shine ever brighter when playing with friends. There's enough variety to designate roles: someone can be DPS (flamethrower), another a healer (regenerative shield), another a sniper, another support (cryo beam lowers enemy shields), and so on. With all of this variety and procedurally generated levels, you'll never have the same run twice.There are cons, of course, but they mostly come in the form of this being an early access title with bugs and unavailable content.Highly recommended."

Even in early download I enjoyed it and it is clear you will either like the game in the first 30 minutes, or the genre is just not for you. It is a simple metroidmania shoot at it's base but has a randomized selection of weapons and loadouts to work with. It is also fairly difficult but the game is easy to learn for most people who are used to the genre. My only problem with it are the instant kill spikes which needs to stop as a trope. No one likes them. But I guess it adds to the game.If you are buying this game, don't be put off by how easy it is to die.

Lot of fun incoming !I look forward to the multiplayer because when you are alone after 10-20 games you have unlocked and tested everything so there is no point in playing more, but with other Jumpers you can try a lot of different setup and use tools that are not reliable when you play solo.Of course having the campaign will be even more great but I know that there is a lot of work to do. I'm sure it will be awesome anyway !The only bad point for now might be that the fire weapons lack dynamism, the classic rifle for instance look and sound like a nerf gun... The character could be more dynamic too, and I don't mean faster but more reactive maybe.The devs seems to pay attention to the feedbacks so that is cool, I'm just sad that the game didn't benefit from a better visibility during the release because it deserves more player and more positive rates.Oh and it could be good to add things to spend our goo because it became useless pretty soon, I currently have 100 000 waiting for somewhere to spend it ^^"

Add onto that the fact that each time you desync (once every 10 seconds or even more frequently), a large message pops up and gets in the way of the game.  The desync got so bad that soon we realized we were nowhere near each other.  Yet on our own computers, we were all relatively close.  My friend tossed a grenade that killed another friend.

There is no penalty for dying, multiplayer, you just respawn in 4 seconds, if for some reason you both die, you might have to run 10 seconds to be back at the same spot.  Who wants to play a facerollwin* type game?  And the upgrades are decent, but you can weild too few options at one time, to really get excited about anything.*When you slap your face on the keyboard and roll from side to side until the desired effect has been reached."

I would really only recommend it if you have a friend to play with -- it makes for a much more exciting experience. As of late January 2017, there are definitely some bugs in the game which affect multiplayer, but I am willing to overlook some of these issues because I do think it is a good game that deserves support. Hopefully the devs will continue working to address these issues in the future. Other than that, my only complaint is that there is a general lack of variety in the level assets, enemies and bosses so it can become a bit repetitive.At $20, I feel I got my enough out of the game to warrant the purchase. I would buy it again and recommend it to friends."

Another thing i think i should mention is that when i first got the game i couldnt play it because the screen was completely black until i found the options button and changed the resolution to something else the dev's might have fixed thisPros:- nostalgic feel- lots of different types of weapons and powerups- getting swarmed by the hive and surviving will make you feel like a badass- controls make sense- has a storyCons:- repetitive gameplay- balance between the powerups is iffy (i kinda only use overshields because its OP)- there are breakable walls to loot rooms that you can only get through if you use the basic rifle (at max rank i think)  or explosive grenades (IE: if you switch your rifle you HAVE to use grenades to get through) but those wont make or break the game- online multiplayer is a bit spotty and can take a while to find a decent group"

You buy the shield and off you go, enemies have almost nothing that differentiate from each other. They fly, they jump, they walk.

The boss fights feels like a cluster, this is most likely where you going to die most of the time.The story is just lacking detail aswell.Game gets an average score of 6/10, if more variation was added and every mission felt more special it would be around 8/10."

76561198077323062,Recommended,295670,29514263,Posted: 26 January,all,Photon,"Hive Jump is a rogue-like shooter that does a pretty good job of speaking for itself. Between the crazy weapons and cheesy soldier mojo, you're here to bust up some bugs and bust them up good. Frankly, things don't get much more complicated than that. But if unloading ridiculous amounts of firepower on thousands upon thousands of insect grunts sounds like a good time, you have no shortage of ways to do it in this game.In Hive Jump, you are tasked with ""jumping"" alien bug hives that have taken up residence a bit too close to human civilization. This can be done solo or with friends, local or online. The online portion is supposedly still beta-ish, and I can confirm that I ran into a few hiccups. The developers appear active in fixing up launch issues though, and if I was able to get into a match without an immediate lag spike, things went pretty smoothly.Hives (or levels) in the game are procedurally generated; the strength or difficulty of the hive typically determines how many floors you'll have to best to consider it cleared. There are four different environments to explore and mid-hive bosses to conquer, as well as player-boosting ""relics"" to find. A form of permadeath is present here but its implemented in a unique way: the team must hold onto and protect a backpack that acts as a mobile spawn point for reinforcements. Its one of the more interesting wrinkles in this game: instead of being cast as a single soldier, you're actually a legion of soldiers who one-by-one fill the shoes of their fallen comrades. Not only does this make for a rather intuitive death mechanic, but the game injects a little extra character via an end-mission memorial for your recently fallen soldiers.Beyond little touches like that though, the game's wit and humor will probably be a love-hate thing for most people. Loading screens have corny one-liners that range from pure silliness to meme references. The brief interactions with NPC's are largely forgettable and often feature fairly random dialogue. There's a bit of charm to it if you don't take it too seriously, but you won't be missing much if you ignore it altogether.Fortunately, you can skim past the goofiness pretty quickly and get straight to what matters most: the running and gunning. The armory in this game is very robust and most everything feels not only usable, but unique. The heavy hitting guns in your arsenal feel plenty powerful, but the more nuanced weapons usually manage to give you nice perks while not sacrificing too much damage output. Grenade and utility equipment types are also used and do a great job of rounding out your loadout. The tactical depth in all three categories of equipment--rifles, grenades and utilities--is pretty impressive.Player customization is easily one of Hive Jump's strongest points. Not only is building a loadout straightforward, but you can swap equipment in between floors if your handy-dandy backpack is still in one piece. As you get used to the basic level structure, you can begin trying to foresee what's coming next and tweak your loadout accordingly. Hive Jump, perhaps in true rogue-like fashion, is a game that gets better the more you put into it. Its a great feeling when a good plan and an optimized loadout come together in a particular run. When taken into account with the numerous game and challenge modes available, such as daily and speed-run challenges, there is a lot of room for trigger-happy players to self-improve and compete on leaderboards.But if you're more into the discovery elements of rogue-likes, Hive Jump's general lack of depth could be a deal breaker. You are going to see a lot of the same type enemies even as you get deeper into a hive, and this repetitiveness generally carries over between runs. Unlocking player equipment does provide some longevity, but not much considering how easy it is to unlock most things. There is a campaign mode (which is also available online,) but it only adds a light tactical layer that is loosely-connected to the actual hive levels themselves. At the end of the day, you should be in this game for the in-level shooting action, because if you can get past the lack of variety the floor-to-floor bullet grind feels surprisingly engaging.So in short, the strong run-and-gun action is clearly the star of the show here. Procedural level generation does just enough to keep a bit of freshness and allow the bullet storm antics to shine. If gun-slinging prowess and a never-ending supply of targets is all you need to have a good time, make no mistake that this game delivers in spades.Quick Summary[+] Strong Run-and-Gun Action[+] Flexible, Fluid Customization[-] Repetitive In-Level Content"

There is a thin layer of campaign which serves to give the repetiveness meaning and ultimately it gives you more of a reason to play.  There is also a progression system where you unlock and upgrade weapons.  The resource you use for that also is required for base building which is probably more important than jumping hives.
