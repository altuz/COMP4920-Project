,Recommended,295690,18630507,"Posted: 22 October, 2015",all,Epilexia,"Particle Maceis a masterful lesson in game design that with its perfect scoring system and haunting beautiful abstract world will put you in some sort of hypnotic trance. While you leave your mind behind you, tracing circles like in a Sufi whirling dance ritual. One of the most captivating game experiences since Tetsuya Mizoguchi’sRez, that gives a true meaning to the expression videogames as an art formIn my first 5 minutes withParticle Mace, I wasn’t so impressed. Sure, the main mechanic was original and a brilliant twist respect to the typical twin stick shooter. But I wasn’t able to understand why it was the favorite game for some of my most beloved friends. But after I spent half an hour with it, when I dominated its psychics mechanics and I understood its scoring system realizing the masterful and completely perfect game design behind it, I became anxious.I felt my pulse accelerated with each heartbeat sending unconscious signals to my mind. Full of binary coded verses talking about the overwhelming sense of beauty suspended in the abstract and almost ethereal world behindParticle Mace.It’s the same sense of accomplishment that you can feel when you meet for the first time a lifetime love, this person who you will spend some of your more pleasant and intimate moments. Sometimes this tempestuous love will induce you to obfuscation, making you to feel a bit dumb about yourself for every bad step taken in your relationship, this meteor that you stupidly crashed while you were concentrated trying to evade a pursuing enemy’s red ship. But then you reconcile with it and the previously induced rage only takes you to a next and much more passionate encounter in which you have a better understanding of every particle in its body, allowing you to achieve a higher score.Sometimes,Particle Maceis a meditative experience that puts you in some sort of state of trance while you are tracing circles at a constant pace that flows like a mantra. An experience similar to a Sufi whirling dance ritual in which the participants are able to elevate his minds from his bodies through the constant act of swirling with the rhythm of the music.At other times,Particle Maceturns into a fast pace and frantic arcade experience with the screen inundated with menacing objects floating in the vastness of space. And you feel inside of a space opera, while you maneuver your ship tracing impossible parables. Creating complex strategies to destroy the enemy ships, trying to not lose the momentum while you increase even more an epic chain of explosions.It has a perfectly crafted level design, that like Nintendo’s most beloved classics, works on a two-dimensional level of complexity. There is a first layer in the game that makes it instantly pleasant to play only to be absorbed in its universe, being an experience close to meditation and with a main mechanic that is instantly fun. And then comes with its second layer of complexity, because the better you learn its level structure, scoring system and enemies patterns, the more you can improve your runs in a competitive way. In each run you can feel your progress, how you have a better knowledge of the game rules every time. At the end, destroying the enemies becomes an instinctive reflex skill.Particle Maceis a game almost eternal. Its three main infinite modes are truly differentiated among them. Each mode has a completely different layout with a diverse range of challenges that can immensely alter the gameplay. And every layout is in a constant change. The more you score, the more new elements are included. Its level of creativity is incredible, slowly introducing new ideas, patterns and obstacles.And then you have a glorious 150 missions mode that constantly amazes you with new design ideas, new menaces, new rules. This mode exhibits a level of ingenuity in its construction that is on par with the constant sense of surprise and novelty found in each of the levels ofSuper Mario Galaxy. WithParticle Mace, Andy Wallace reveals himself as one of the better videogame designers of his generation.And all of this is embraced with one of the most beautiful and evocative abstract worlds seen since Tetsuya Mizoguchi’sRez. The game is enveloped by a special sense of loneliness, an intense feeling of melancholy and introspection that can let us spend hundred of hours in it, while we’re absorbed in a universe constructed via suspended and ethereal backgrounds. A feeling that is intensified thanks to a hypnotic soundtrack that rises in a perfect crescendo to highlight the most action packed moments.Particle Maceis one of these games that likeRezyears before, makes that you couldn’t conceive a single hard work day that not end in feeling for a mere instant its abstract beauty while you are immersed in the still of the night. Captivating your soul and showing you the true meaning of the expression videogames as an art form.( The writer of this review is not an English native. So you should expect occasional grammar errors. I apologize in advance. )"

You know how sometimes you're just looking for a good, cheap game that you can sink your teeth into right away without having to think too much about it? A game that has an interesting new mechanic and is instantly addictive? This is that game. It takes about five seconds to learn the basics, and then it grabs you--that whole whip-the-mace-at-rocks-and-ships thing.For those who don't know: Imagine chunks of space junk tethered (by bungie cords) to an agile spaceship. The trick is to, with a single thumbstick, use the ship's momentum and direction to fling those tethered chunks like a mace and pulverize asteroids and enemy ships. (Yes, there is a local, four-player muiltiplayer mode.) It's simply divine.While it is inspired by arcade classics, it instantly sets itself apart. There's a whole lot of variety here for just a few bucks. This is that game you'll play as your warm-up for a marathon session of some bigger, grander game. Only...you'll probably look up after a few hours and realize that you spent all your time flinging the PARTICLE MACE.WARNING: Like a lot of folks, I was disappointed about the lack of Steam Controller support. I'm glad I took the time to dig up my old Xbox 360 controller, but this omission is unfortunate.Still, to quote Doug McKenzie: ""...all in all, a good five dollars worth for me and my whole family."""

Controls work great (xbox 360 gamepad) & responsive, great tutorial, and has a good amount of incentive to keep playing.  There are 3 levels (normal, hard, astroid) to play for your highest score, and the gameplay is fun enough to keep you trying for a little bit.  There are ships with different characteristics to unlock, which change how you might play the levels.  And what keeps me engaged are the 150 missions that vary things up to meet some objective, like kill 5 enemies within a circle around the starting point, or kill a certain number of astroids, or don't kill anything for a certain amount of time, etc.  There is a decent amount of variety to the missions, and then they increase the mission level.  This is a surprisingly competent game.  I am very happy that I gave this a shot.Plays great on my Windows 10 Alienware Alpha on my 47"" TV with an xbox360 gamepad."
,Recommended,295690,29387625,Posted: 20 January,all,Pogo,"Geometry Wars MeleePlays best with a controller, but unfortunately the game will not accept a Steam controller.Your typical top-down twin-stick shooter, except that it's not typical because it's not a shooter and it only uses one stick.Move your ship around and use the inertia to swing your tetherballs at enemies and asteroids. Your own tetherballs can't hurt you, but contact with anything else will destroy your ship. The asteroids float around slowly like the asteroids in the game Asteroids. They also divide similarly. Enemies have different movement patterns, but they all come for you eventually.The arcade mode is fine: survive as long as you can and try for a high score (and by extension a couple achievements).I had a lot more fun playing through Mission Mode: There are 150 tasks for you to accomplish (things like ""beat 10 enemies"" or ""pass through the checkpoints without breaking any asteroids""), and you're assigned 3 at a time. The round ends either when you crash your ship or when all three active tasks have either been passed or failed. Successfully completing a task crosses it off the list, and when the round ends you're dealt a new one to replace it. For the most part, they're delivered to you in increasing difficulty. An early mission may challenge you to survive for 20 seconds in a limited radius, while a later mission may demand 60 seconds within the outer pull radius of a black holeI'm not sure if the 150 tasks are always delivered in the same order, but they make for some interesting combinations. Unfortunately, some of the combinations are infuriating. I had a round wherein I was expected to:Accumulate 300 points while limited to 1 tethered particleDestroy 10 enemies (Level layout: small cage, black hole)Completely break down a gigantic asteroid to its smallest componentAny two of those tasks would've been fine, but having all 3 active at the same time meant I was trapped in a fairly small level choked with gigantic asteroids all getting pulled toward a black hole faster than I could repeatedly break them down with my single particle. After dozens of failed attempts, I finally got an asteroid configuration that allowed me to carefully sneak around and pick off the 10 enemies, so that when I died, the next round wouldn't be the claustrophobic black hole stage.There are multiple ships to unlock, offering varying top speeds and particle options. You can change ships between each round of Mission mode, giving you an advantage against certain types of challenges.Glad I dug out a 360 controller to give this one another try.Showoff / 10"

You have to move your ship in order to move the wrecking ball. You will have to kill targets with your wrecking ball by swinging it around. While the game is easy to understand with easy controls, It isn't easy to hit objects with the wrecking ball. Sometimes this could be even frustating too. But the game idea is totally there.  There are like 150 missions with each of their own objective. Like ""kill this within 5 secs"" or ""stay here for 15 secs"" and so go on.Game controls are good.Music is alright.Graphics is okay.Hitbox is perfectly accurate.There is a small tutorial.There is a difficulty settings.Local Co-op up to 4 players.

,Recommended,295690,26423442,"Posted: 4 November, 2016",all,mynameismonkey,"It might seem like a misnomer, yet if Particle Mace shows anything, it's that it's possible to feel totally claustrophobic in space. Yes, notwithstanding being among the evidently unending degree that is the universe, you can feel swarmed, penned in, even pursued among the stars - well, while going up against Andy Wallace's high-score chaser, that is.Here's a preoccupation where, from the word go, you get yourself completely incorporated by comets tumbling towards your position and foe make brisk to track you down and take you out, without even a weapon to shoot in fear. Besides, for the underlying few tries at any rate, you're not at risk to survive said trap for more than a couple of minutes, either.Seen beginning from the top, Particle Mace's 2D thought on space is a round of survival, with a virtual thumbstick at the base of the screen your elite effect on strategies. Dealing with your ship around an encased piece of space, the fundamental way you can to shield yourself is to utilize the trails of refuse added to the back of your craft that the redirection urges you to use like a mace, swinging around to clear your surroundings.Anything your stopgap mace scopes is either annihilated (by virtue of enemy water crafts) or if nothing else diminished in size, with centers amassed along these lines. You then have a short window of time in which to build up a multiplier, with any additional boats you take out in progression passing on results of 10 centers when hung together.What makes Particle Mace especially fascinating is this separation between the redirection's setting and reality of its play. The preoccupation's instructional practice overemphasizes your disconnection: you're the last surviving pontoon in the universe, and you don't have anything to your name other than the fuel in your tank. Regardless, the insignificant method for the play space and the growing number of articles in your direction suggests that you're something other than alone – while your first instinct may be to keep up a vital separation from all your beforehand specified adversaries, really survival infers ducking and diving between said segments remembering the true objective to forgo them.Indeed, Particle Mace is a session of smoothness. When you build up a musicality, it quickly ends up being evident that you have to voyage particularly close to the contort in order to survive. A couple of foes, for instance, will fly around space in much an indistinct route from you, with their way especially easy to track. Others, regardless, are essentially more unconventional, shooting or pivoting space in impacts. Everything infers that being bashful will, after a hidden few butchers, achieve nothing for you, and to string together the kind of top scores required to open better ships for later entertainments, you have to fly straight up to your rivals and take them out just before they do similarly to you.It's the time when you start hanging together these multipliers that Atom Mace really finds its feet and play gets especially hurried, however if you support much all the more a test, the preoccupation's fundamental objective mode sees you have to open three achievements in one burst of play. Killing a set number of enemies in just a couple of minutes, or take out adversary especially all while endeavoring to hit distinctive destinations meanwhile gives Atom Mace's focal objective mode an extra edge and, in light of current circumstances, serves as an accommodating mentor for the major mode, giving you allow to do the kind of betrays you may shy a long way from in the essential mode, yet have the sureness to come back to in the wake of acing them going up against the preoccupation's missions.Also, furthermore an allow to have a touch of fun, and – with everything taken into account – Atom Mace shies a long way from putting fun in advance. It really doesn't have any kind of effect about the setting, nor does the setting of the waste trails you use to monitor yourself have a critical impact, either. What it is, that as it might, is put an absolutely one of a kind transform on what could have easily transformed into a standard, best down space shooter. Particle Mace, rather, feels absolutely new paying little heed to its retro stylings and passes on the kind of experience perfect for adaptable – eat measured bits of play faultless eatable in an additional couple of minutes, yet adequately content on offer for the people who support to some degree more than a snack, too.Space, then, may not be completely as diminish and unfilled as we want to think it is – it may actually be coordinating with life vivacious to take an interest in battle - yet if Atom Mace is anything to cruise by, it's little consider everyone on earth rushes to get up there.Putting another bend on the space shooter, Atom Mace is hurried to its inside, blaming you for fighting off gatherings of enemies without even a slug to fire with all due regard. Regardless, its disconnected mighty style isolates it from whatever is left of the class and the troubles stuffed inside guarantee it'll stay centered home screen for a long time to come.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time.

It's a twin-stick-shooter, except you only use one stick, if that makes any sense.Instead of directional fire from the second stick, you drag ""particles"" behind you on stretchy tethers (i.e. a ""mace), and use the physics model to whip your mace into enemies.It's a neat mechanic that forces the player to split their focus between dodging enemies and asteroids, and fudgily manipulating the mace to make kills. The physics model is simple but perfect, and never feels arbitrary or mean. There's a classic score-chase mode, and a ""mission"" mode, which gives the player a selection of interesting goals to meet, which provides a neat way to switch up the gameplay and keep it fresh. There's multiple ships to unlock, which provide further tweaks to how the game plays.It's not going to be your game of the year, but Particle Mace might be your ""interesting diversion of the year that you boot up for five or ten minutes every week""."

It has a very nice, well-fitting, ambient soundtrack. The backstory is gripping. And last but not least – it can notably pride itself in having the best controller remapping in the history of gaming.It does have a number of drawbacks, though – namely:• a console window is shown when the game is starting;• you cannot change variables governing the game's behavior (at least not in-game);• Alt + F4 does not work.Still, it is a fun game to spend some evenings with!"

If you get such a combo, your only option is to either play the game until you get lucky or hack the mission XML file to change the missions you're playing - neither is what I'd expect to do to complete a game.Everytime you kill an enemy the game pauses/shakes the screen.  This is fine when there are a few enemies, but when there are lots the game becomes a stutterfest and it's almost impossible to control your ship/avoid hitting stuff.Whether a controller works or not seems random - restarting sometimes fixes it.  A controller is advisable here - being able to sneak or dash is key to completing missions - so it's a pain having to restart the game a few times to make it work.Some achievements seem reluctant to unlock - most are REALLY hard so it's even more demoralising when they fail to trigger.As I said earlier, it's a fun concept but it needs a BIT of polishing/some bugfixes and - well - doesn't seem like the developer plans to do any"

The Black Ops 3 campaign is way longer than what we are used to in this franchise. I think it took me about 12 hours, which is a good length for a shooter, even by normal standards - but especially compared to other Call of Duty games.The story was pretty boring in the beginning. But it got better and better, to the point where I was honestly interested in how it all would play out. The acting was pretty good (real actors, digitalized). And the ending - well, the ending was great. It left me sitting in front of my monitor and wondering what the hell just happened. I ended up reading explanations and theories about the story for another 20 minutes. It is a surprisingly complex story for this kind of action game. Not quite on the same level as Bioshock Infinite or To the Moon, but way above your usual CoD story. I have to say, I really liked it (despite the boring start).The gameplay is CoD standard. Nothing special here. You have some abilities to unlock and upgrade. But I rarely used them. You have a wall-run, but only a few opportunities to use it in the levels. It felt unnecessary. And that was a shame, because it's a cool mechanic and should have been integrated better in the level design. Most of your enemies are the typical noname soldiers. There are also certain types of mechs. Some are soldier-like, and a few bigger ones, which require the use of a rocket launcher. So there is some variety here, but in the end it is typical CoD shooter gameplay. Which is not brilliant, but alright.The graphics are ok. The game looks quite good sometimes, but overall dated. They really make the most out of the old engine. But the game cannot compete with modern titles like Battlefront or Witcher 3.If you want a number - I guess I would give it a 7.5/10 for the campaign. And it could have been more, had they improved the gameplay a little more. I really didn't think it would be that good."

The premise of using ""physics""  in this manner instead of just being another shooter is intriguing but the controls and some design choices destroy what reliable fun you could have here. Largely the game plays how it looks in the steam video. However, the controls are simply a touch too sloppy and sluggish. Considering that you need to be nimble and fast in order to survive and reliably attack with your trailing balls makes it critical to have perfect controls.Barring that, which can be ignored once you get used to it, there is one super, super annoying aspect and that's the screenshake after killing an enemy. It's like a stutter zoom and it's stupid and I hate it. *kicks dirt* It adds nothing and if it's meant to add a sense of chaos or whatever, there are better ways to do that.I paid 20 cents for this and really...still not worth it.

It makes a lot of fun and I definitly recommend it, but it's not perfect.Each time you kill an enemy or asteroid the screen shakes. While this makes every kill very rewarding and is generally nice in arcade mode (try to score as high as possible without dieing), it can be very frustrating in mission mode (do special missions like ""survive 30 seconds without killing a foe""). There are missions that require fast and precise play, and the screenshakes make it a lot harder and extremly frustrating.Another problem with the missions is, that a lot of missions don't synergies with each other. Every time you play mission mode, you are given 3 missions (150 missions in total). Most of the time I was not able to complete all 3 at once because they excluded each other (e.g. ""survive 30 seconds without killing a foe"" and ""kill 8 foes in 30 seconds""). This made mission mode a bit slow and repetitive.Still, the majority of the game is super awesome! The idea of a bunch of particles as your weapon is great and makes a lot of fun. The music is nice and the game is challanging, but not unfair (except a few missions). Although the graphic is simple, it's not bad.TL;DR Don't excepct a perfect game, but it's great to play now and then. Recommended."

I've never played a game with this same inertia-based combat, but I love it. There are about 8 different ships you can unlock, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, they are pretty evenly balanced. The three different modes keep you pretty busy, with arcade ranging from easy to hard, to a special asteroids-only mode where there are no enemies, but that only makes it harder. There are 150 different challenges in challenge mode and some of them are pretty creative, such as avoiding the black hole, or destroying X amount of enemies with only two particles.Surprizingly enough, I love the soundtrack for this game. When you first jump into the game is has a calm, 16-bit sounding rhythm, but slowly speeds up the longer you survive, and becomes frantic as the map itself tries to kill you. I went ahead and bought the soundtrack with the game, and I am not disappointed.Since this game is currently $0.19, I suggest buying it right now before it goes back up to $9.99.

Your tentacles are your only weapons as you try to dodge the numerous alien ships and asteroids that are trying to hit your soft, vulnerable body. Seriously, just play it, and you'll get what I mean. Btw, super fun, with plenty of achievments, ships to unlock, modes, etc. Just trust me, it's worth it. It's atmospheric, challenging if you want it to be, relaxing if you want it to be, and pretty much has something for everyone. It's super easy to understand as far as the controls and the objectives, but you'll find yourself strategizing to outwit your enemies, even if you just buy the game as a relaxing time-passer."

,Recommended,295690,19677866,"Posted: 13 December, 2015",all,Sheep!,"In comparing games and game systems, the refrain ""Graphics don't matter,"" is typically just the fallback cry of the partisan whose favoured game or system has demonstrably inferior graphics.Particle Maceis one of the rare games that proves the phrase correct.Graphically,Particle Maceis an obvious direct descendant of the original vectoredAsteroids, just prettied up a little.  Instead of pivot-and-shoot gameplay, however, your gunless ship battles by dragging little objects around on tethers, and using inertia to swing them around.  It's a fairly simple concept, but the game keeps it from getting stale too quickly by gradually introducing variant ships with slightly different performance characteristics, and missions (challenges, really) that provide twists on the core gameplay.Particle Maceis a simple but addictive game.  Part of the secret of the addictiveness is that the game gradually gets harder, but is scrupulously fair.  It gives that ""one more try"" feeling because, when you die -- and you die alot-- the death always feels like your fault.  I've yet to have a death in this game feel like the game cheated or presented an impossible situation; I always get the sense that if I'd only played a little bit better, I might have triumphed, and that draws me back for another round."

You face off in the ultimate arena known only as ""arcade.""  This game is different from most games on the market because your decisions actually mean something, just like the original Super Hexagon (no TellTale here!).  For instance, the ""score"" in the bottom left corner isn't a score at all; it shows how many humans the combine will keep alive to enslave when they take over Pandora (the higher number the better btw).The story is very complex.  There's tons of sexual tension between the rocks and a triangle, and you, the player, can decide where to put it.  Will you release the tension by having alien sex like in Star Effect, or will you build it up to become stronger like in 1984 by George Orwell.  Like I said, your decisions really affect the story, and the better decisions you make the more story you get.

The concept of the game is simple, you fly around dragging a bunch of weights that are smashed into enemies while trying not to crash into obstacles. It reminds me of Hammerfight quite a bit, with a dash geometry wars thrown in. It's incredibly satisfying to control, especially when you accomplish something tricky. There are a number of different ships with their own quirks and features, I really enjoyed the differences they each provided, especially in the multiplayer versus. They're not really balanced, but that hardly matters when you're playing by yourself or with friends.No online, but local multiplayer is pretty solid if you've got people around and multiple gamepads. There aren't very many maps, but they're dynamic and faily distinct. The game also slowed down quite a bit in multiplayer as players moved apart and the game had to zoom out. This was on my laptop however, which is nothing close to a powerhouse, but still suggests some optimization issues.I don't think I'd recommend the game without a controller, I just can't imagine fluidly controlling the ships without one. Fortunately, it's been friendly with all types that I've tried (360 and logitech).If nothing else, it's great arcade time waster."

Get yourself and up to 3 other friends together for some arena deathmatch, where the aim of the game is to swing your balls (maces?) at the opponents. Score points by destroying their ship. There are a handful of different ships to choose from, each with their own unique attributes; from the slow and steady Heavy with its large particle maces to the Hyper, which can fling its maces about halfway across the screen.Pick up some controllers, crank up the asteroids, and strap in for some hair-raising close calls. Definitely recommended."

The shaking is unnecessary and tough on the eyes and it makes it impossible to control the ships because you have no idea where the asteroids, the borders and your ship are while its shaking violently. There are quite a few different types of ships but most of them are worthless or have worthless features like all the mace parts clumping together at speeds necessary to keep them circling or drifing off to one side from some invisible wind and not having any snap when you need it.The missions are pretty clever and will keep you entertained for 6 hours or so but after that I think Particle Mace has limited appeal as too much depends on luck. Definitely worth a few bucks though and no regrets that I bought it."

Don't expect it to be more than a simple arcade game and you will enjoy it. The ""missions"" are crap (kill x enemies, survive for x time, stay in circle for x time, etc) and you will have to do them if you intend to unlock all the ships. Swinging particles around and attempting to survive for as long as possible in arcade mode is good fun though. Good score attack game, crap campaign.EDIT: It gives you three missions at once. Some of those missions can make each other nearly impossible. I can't get past it now because it gave me a mission that makes the screen filled with asteroids, a mission that makes the screen filled with enemies, and a mission that makes it so I have no weapons. So now I'm screwed. Very annoying that there is no way to turn some off and only focus on completing one.Also, this game is pretty similar to the game space hunk, which is free, but only has a 1 v 1 mode. If you're just in it to mess around with a friend, the link to that is herehttp://ludosity.com/tag/spacehunk/"

Otherwise you will die dozens of times ending with you quiting (asteroid field!). This will happen because of your cursor getting stuck and not being able to regain control almost untill you die.

You've got a really amazing control over your ship letting you gracefully (or not) smash your way through the different missions and enemies. Missions are difficult adding a sense of challenge to the game. And unlocking the different ships is a goal that is enticing to complete. For a cheap game this is a great passtime."

Beware, because the difficulty spikes to insane levels, especially near the endgame. Plus, the screenshaking is abhorrent and makes latter levels close to unplayable.

Asteroids with a twist.You can choose between free play, which is essentially endless survival, and missions, which gives you objectives to do. For example, some missions put a black hole in the map that you have to avoid, or put you in an asteroid field and tell you to survive for however many seconds.Doing missions and getting high scores will unlock different ships, which mostly differ in movement speed and amount of particles. Some ships do have special abilities though, such as ignoring your first collision with an object.Not sure I would recommend it at full price, but it goes on sale fairly often for $1, which is well worth it."

There's just enough randomness to keep gameplay interesting without frustrating the player overtly.  This ball-and-chain mechanic is interesting and warrants trying out on the current or next sale."
