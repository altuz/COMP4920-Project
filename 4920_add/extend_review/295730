,Recommended,295730,11117238,"Posted: 7 July, 2014",all,Bogandemon,"This is a short review of this game. I touch areas minimally, and this is mostly an opinion.For a game that seemed so simple on the outside, It's great. It's a beautifully made game about running in and shooting the hell out of anything that moves. The graphics are well done, the mechanics are nice, the sound in this game is catchy and enjoyable, and offers a challenge to overcome the barrages of bullets and enemies. This game is great and all, However there are things that I don't like.I happen to be a person who likes to 100% games with achievements and all, and having to go back and forth through multiple areas multiple times just gets painful. I forget that I am indeed able to die, and just run through like I'm god, forgetting about my gun and shield. I have also found a few glitches here and there. Once, I was able to go on the water at the beginning, before I had the ability to, accessing an area I shouldn't have been able to otherwise. I also managed to get myself glitched in the wall at the third boss. Not able to die, teleport or go back, I had the reset, doing the entire place again as well as the boss. That♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off a lot.Overall, this game is still great, the music and graphics are colourful, and the game mechanics are nice. There are minor annoyances, but they aren't game breaking."

My fiance has looked at me sideways as I throw tantrums at my screen after I've died during a long and nerve racking, nail-biting boss fight. Sometimes even just making your way to the well scatted stores is a mission in itself, but for some reason having to chomp through hordes of enemies that are attacking you from every perceivable angle does not wane in fun value after you have left that area and come back to it again.The graphics are clean, smooth and lovely to look at. The environments maintain a lot of diversity which makes stumbling upon new areas always exciting. Unlocking upgrades and the way in which you do is very fun and satisfying. I can't be the only one to start salivating when I come accross a giant heart!The boss fights are AWESOME to say the least. There's so much happening, I must say this game has given me better hand-eye coordination because I slowly get better at dodging bullets (slowly).You will die a lot, swear a lot (this is the first game that has actually made me scream out loud, lol), you will smile a lot and possible feel psychopathic.Overall I give this game a 9/10 -- 1 point off for the lack of story, which isn't at all necessary to enjoy the game, but that would complete it. I also understand that controller support is in the works, so keep that in mind if you're considering this game! I think that would make it a hell of a lot better, which seems impossible!"

Cheesy Gunner. Okay i was sleepy, so ... sorry for reading wrong.Yes, that name reminds me of the old era and i had a look at it.Believe me, it WAS love at first sight because the Gunner looks so awesome. Great Design.So i paid, was it 0,50 Cent, something like that and that was the beginning of a REALLY addicted friendship.Starting with the game, okay using mouse and keys, i was suprised how easily it was to get into the gameplay.Driving the Gunner with the keys in all directions, aiming and firing at the targets with the mouse in all directions at the same time. No limits, except the low weapons at the beginning. But hey the Cheesy  .... ehm ... Sweezy Gunner can be upgraded and that must be earned. Believe me, the Gunner has some nice weapons that will bring fun, but it has no no no Kitty Bombs. *sniff*So you start at your ship and go from one part of the card to another. Fire all that moves, because if it moves it can hurt you. Baaaadly. You know what? This game reminds me, from the style and mechanics of the good old Super Nintendo Zelda. Go from card to card, rise up, get more hearts and defeat one Big (And i mean REALLY BIG) Boss after another, getting also cool upgrades, to reach places from before, that were blocked with some kind of walls or other obstacles.Well, your Gunner is not a smart guy with a sword and a shield. This one goes by 2 great wheels, a plated body and a biiiig gun.Sweezy Gunner is a great Bullet Hell game, with a very nice rising of the difficulty level. This Game is fair ... well at one point not, but that is my opinion, i tell you at the end. Where was i ... ah yes, this game is fair und gives you a lot of fun. All you have to do is to pay simple 3.99 cent (Or less, look at sales).I played so many games, that are more expensive and so many dind`t gave me the fun that Che... Sweezy Gunner gave me. I remember how i was addicted to get all the achievements, to rise the Gunner and to reach the next boss.Yes i got through i got all the achievements and was happy .... but stop!Looking at the achievements i saw 4 new achievements. Challenge achievements. Okay, i said. Doing it, earning it, getting! You thought so. These Challenging Levels are hard as hell. And now i get my opinion from before, you remember my words. Fairness? Woah that Levels are, in my opinion, so unfair, but they can be done. Looking at global Achievements, they can be really done, but the danger of a rage quitt is really high.So i`m still sad, not to have that awesome game in my 100% List....Dear Windybeard, thanks for that awesome game, but don´t meet me in the Dark saying CHALLENGE LEVELS, :)Anyway at last, if you like this kind of Retro Games you`re really in. Great price, great Gameplay, great music, great design and also a chance of Ragequitting (Challen&%$§$%&&&) if you need this.Enjoy!I want more. What about a second part, dear Windybeard. :)"

I had a coupon and got it for significantly less even.This is a wonderful throw-back to old-school twin stick shootem-up gaming, only with character progression this time. Very satisfying bullet-hell gunfighting. Also has heavy MetroidVania elements!Pros:1. You will get WAYYYYY more hours out of this than the price merits2. Awesome addicting twin-stick mayhem3. Awesome soundtrack4. MetroidVania elements all overCons:1. No controller support... Yet2. Graphic style turned me off at first, but now I am more ok with them. I think it is that there is no real theme to the enemies - one minute you are real-life birds and the next it is spiders BoI style, and yet later it may be weird robotsThis is well, well worth the money."

A great game, with a really, REALLY big world to explore.A few spelling errors/typing errors in the game (sheild -> shield, compelte -> complete), and after defeating the third boss, I had to save, and quit, because I got stuck the next room I entered (to the left of the boss room).If you like game just as Delver, The binding of Isaac, Nuclear throne,... this game is something you might consider buying!"
,Recommended,295730,14298123,"Posted: 2 February, 2015",all,ej,"This is a multidirectional shooter with Zelda-like exploration and progression, similar to Zelda/Gauntlet clones from the 80s, especially ones made by Compile, but with more bullets on screen :) Very tight , fast-paced gameplay, decent 2D graphics, cool bosses, good sense of humour. Oh, and great synth music(DnB mostly).If you like shooting, dodging bullets, exploring and earning powerups you MUST buy this game even if it costs several times more than it costs now.Having said that I must mention that, while being very enjoyable, this game is not perfect. For example:No gamepad support. YES, this is a ""dual-stick"" shooter that has no support for ""sticks"".You can't redefine keys, and the default layouts are not perfect for this game in my opinion. But don't get me wrong, its still a blast to play.It crashes unexpectedly from time to time.After several hours it becomes somewhat repetitive, because it doesn't introduce new elements and most new enemies simply have more health, move faster and spew more bullets in wider patterns. Basically, even before reaching 50% you are starting to feel like you already got most of the enjoyment from the game and its time to wrap things up.Bullets could be slightly more visible, some of the graphics could be polished more, minimap could be useful, etc etc.."

The game soundtrack is like drum and bass which is really catchy and goes well with the game. If you complete the game you can also attempt the challenge mode which is extremely difficult and I’m not going to bother attempting it because I fear for my laptops safety lol.

It's layed out in the sense that you can go back and access areas that were previously inaccessible with your new abilities, and by doing so you can upgrade your gunner even more.It becomes addicting to collect what is known as Monster Cards, which is a collectible card dropped by enemies that allows you to learn a new powerup once you've killed enough of them. Pacing is excellent and the economic system isn't over generous which makes you want to collect enough gold to unlock some significant power ups (especially once it gets difficult towards the end)He also throws in survival mode which pits you against an endless onslaught of enemies until you can't take any more, fun to compete for high scores. With the mention of coming out with a challenge mode, this game is beyond worth the price tag"
,Recommended,295730,16311549,"Posted: 11 June, 2015",all,qoucher,"A simple point and click shooter, though this one is more point and hold.+Plenty of upgrades exist throughout this game, though they feel a little subtle at first, the power soon will show itsself.+The enemies become a little redundant, and often feel copied but just harder.+The evironments are wonderful and leave a good feel to the game, while not distracting from the action or becoming confusing with all of the visual stimulus happening.+The soundtrack feels simple and repetitive, but sometimes can be just what you need to get in the zone of all the action.After a certain point in the game, it becomes literally impossible to play without using the shield that becomes availible due to the massive continuous amounts of enemy shots coming from every possible direction.The final boss is a little outrageous as well, I believe he is also impossible to fight without losing health.All in all a wonderful game for it's price, especially if it becomes on sale."

Even if you are a hardcore bullet hell fan, you will die. And die again. You will die at least 5 times. And what's not helping is that most of the time you don't even know what killed you because there were a lot of things at the same time on the screen, and all of those things are aiming at you. The game is colorful and hand-drawn. Every character has a personality, no matter their lifetime. That's what makes this game unique. And also the fact that you die over 534789534789 times."

Would you like an arcadey bullet hell that also has quests, bosses, temporary AND permanent upgrades, and open world exploration? Welp, here you go.The only complaint I could possibly say about the game is that there is an issue with edges where if your little robot character touches the edge of a wall or object, he tends to get stuck to it instead of sliding along it. This little snag will definitely get you shot a couple of times.It's super simple. Not at all complex. But a great game for just mindlessly shooting and dodging."

Saves work fine but you better not forget to manually save from time to time!- Game doesn't auto-save or anything when you go to the credits after the final boss. Had to re-do the entire last dungeon (quite frustrating, so remember to save often as said above).This game is an easy recommendation if you like bullet-hell games.
