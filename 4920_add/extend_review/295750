I'm very happy that the game and developer will get the greater attention that each deserve through the new release.  It's an amazing but simple platformer that really demonstrates how much there will always be left to do with what seems like an old genre.  The game might follow just a few simple rules, but the emergence of complex phenomena from the seemingly simple restraints will be a constant and entertaining challenge.I remember reading a blog post by the developer where he stated challenging himself to not use the color green for the surfaces of the game.  It would be too easy to make the ground green, too obvious.  He instead chose to work the color in such a way that green would be implied, giving us dusk views where the blue suggests grass, or strange and outlandish colors that strangely connect themselves to grass in our minds.  The same degree of thought went into every aspect of the game, and it certainly shows.As far as I’m concerned Ian Snyder is right up there with Terry Cavanagh, and this game shows it."
,Recommended,295750,10329523,"Posted: 2 June, 2014",all,MrNinjaSquirrel,"Wouldn't it be awesome if the floor was made of wibbly, wobbly, oh so sweet jelly? Disregarding the obvious stickiness it sounds like a rather ridiculous and amazing idea to me, but luckily video games exist so we no longer have to wonder and can see for ourselves what a world made of gelatin might be like. As it turns out, Ian Snyder's The Floor is Jelly is almost entirely as delightful and playful as you could hope for, with so much raw joy and charm oozing out of it that I found it nigh impossible to restrain the enormous smile plastered across my place as I played.As the extremely literal title lets you know, the floor (and pretty much everything else) is made of bouncy, jiggling jelly that sways and molds as you platform your way through levels. More than just an enjoyable gimmick, Synder constantly finds incredible simple but ingenious ways to use it as a mechanic, from the obvious trampoline effect propelling you higher, to bouncing into the ground to momentarily cause it to sag as you scurry under obstacles. The game never dwells on any one jelly application for more than a few levels, driven by an erratic ""need"" for variety that keeps every level feeling completely unique from the last, but held together by the constant wobble of the world. The nonlinear structure is incredibly relaxed, never wanting to punish the player and allowing you to explore at your own pace, which is a very welcome change from so many hyper demanding platformers we've seen released as of late.The one instance where the continual reworking of mechanics works against the game is in the final few levels, which take on a faux-glitch design that involves changing the properties for the jelly you bounce on. The idea is good in theory, but in practice it causes the world more often than not to spazz entirely out of control, leaving it largely up to luck if you can make it to the exit before things go insane. It's really a shame that it ends on a pretty sour note, because up until that point I was absolutely in love with the game and its laid back atmosphere, which the later levels go entirely against. Some unexplainable slowdown and technical issues add to the list of annoyances that should have no place in such a beautiful game.Take one look at any of the other moments in the game, and it's hard to stay upset about a lackluster ending. The art design is absurdly charming and endearing, with the way the jelly moves being particularly delightful in ways I can't put into words. The color pallet changes with each new level you enter, all of which align with a chill design philosophy akin to laying in a hammock on a lazy summer day; it's impossible to keep from wanting to stay in this world forever. A gorgeous soundtrack by Disasterpeace (who my admiration for seems to grow on a daily basis) perfectly blends into the background, with spurts of sound accompanying your actions, creating a dynamic musical score that feels like a living organism playing along with you.It's not quite perfect, but The Floor is Jelly enchanted me in ways I haven't felt from a game in a long time. The level of love poured into the game by its developer is palpable, to where you really want to overlook the bad bits because there's so much more to enjoy about the experience. It probably won't charm everyone like it did me, and anyone looking for a challenging or lengthy (you'll likely finish it in about 2 hours) will come away disappointed, but if you can take it for what it is The Floor is Jelly is the sort of game that's more than willing to curl up under a blanket with you and hug you to death with its cuteness.Maybe that's a little weird to say about a game, but The Floor is Jelly inspires unusual praise and deserves all it receives."

,Recommended,295750,10346137,"Posted: 4 June, 2014",all,mark | dj.,"The Floor Is Jelly... If you ever played - and liked -Super Meat Boy then this is for you. It doesn't have any controller support however, so movement is a bit more difficult compared to using a controller but it's easy enough to remember as it's literally only a few keys to take into account.There are several worlds, all with their own physics and little puzzles (if you can call them that). You drop out of a window and have to enter a window somewhere else in the level. But there are many obstacles in the form of platforms and you have to be quick or need to know how to figure out how the physics work. Fortunately the levels last only a few minutes and they're easy enough to complete......Until the end, that is. Near the end the world becomescorruptedand the levels become frustratingly hard and start to rely on luck instead of skill. And this goes on for quite a while. Every time I thought I was finally finished, the game gave me new levels. They kept coming. Until finally, it stopped. In that aspect the developer seemed to try and mimic Fez, which is totally unnecessary because it has enough charm and style to give it its own identity. A little bit disappointed there.The graphics are colorful and the style reminds me of Ibb & Obb (which I haven't even started playing yet). It looks great, especially the animations and things like flowers popping up from the ground and the music is relaxing, even if it's repetitve.This isn't a very long game. I think it can be finished within 2-2,5 hours. Which is more than enough for me personally. Platformers usually don't stay fresh long enough to keep them interesting for tens of hours. But that's my opinion, of course.So, in short; The Floor Is Jelly is a great platformer, but prepare to be annoyed and frustrated near the end. Look past all that and you have an incredibly smart, charming game right here.[Rating: 78/100]"

Super Meat Boy is totally a no-no for me.When I first saw The Floor Is Jelly and noticed it had insta-kill spikes and tricky jumping, I was sure it was not for me. I still got it, but figured it would not be played much. I was wrong.It does have some really tricky bits, and you will die a lot on some levels, but the gameplay is just fun and actually quite relaxing. There is rarely anyhing to force you to rush, you can take your time and figure out the level, while listening to the wonderful ambient soundtrack.The influence of a game like VVVVVV is clear, especially with the kind of open world and the need to explore more than the usual platformer.Clocked about six hours on this, including a bit of exploring, and enjoyed all of it, even the slightly hard puzzles and jumping sections. Of course, if you are part of the OCD crowd and want every acheivement expect to spend a lot more...I played it with a controller, and it's probably easier than with the keyboard, since you have more analog control on the stick.Highly recommended if you want a nice platformer which is not too frustrating, with orginal gameplay and a great soothing soundtrack."

The height of any given jump is unpredictable. If you are in a safe spot, you can repeatedly perform the same jump until you get the height you want. If need to jump while running... well, you can just hope (and probably fail, then replay the level the exact same way and hope you get a better unpredictable jump height next time).Some other, more tolerable issues:- Same old ""unique surprise"" at the end- No gamepad support- Occasional glitches (stuck in a wall, physics launching characters unpredictably, stuck in a perpetual-death loop, etc.)- Meandering overworld maps without any real purpose/content, just meanderingCompleted or Quit: Completed"

,Not Recommended,295750,24697686,"Posted: 3 August, 2016",all,Manfred von Karma,"First of all, let me start off by saying this ""no"" recommendation is at the full price, because this game is definitely not worth $10. On sale for a dollar or two, it's definitely worth checking out.So let's start with the positives. This game is full of ingenuity and really interesting mechanic ideas. Most levels have some kind of unique gimmick to them, which are then fully explored over the course of the area.Most of these work pretty well. They add an interesting wrinkle to the gameplay and some of them change up the playstyle substantially. My personal favorite was the water level- each stage is half covered by water, which essentially acts as a flipped gravity zone. This gave each level a great deal of verticality, and I think it was the best showcase of the game's physics.Speaking of which, the physics are mostly pretty good. The jelly floors react satisfyingly to your movements and jumps, and although they can lead to some frustration with precision (more on that later), overall it's a fun concept. You can bounce all over the place, and the jelly physics are used in some interesting ways.The music and aesthetics are top-notch. It is a surprisingly atmospheric game, and always pretty to look at.And now, we must move on to the game's problems. First of all, a lot of people are reporting major bugs with the game. Personally I didn't encounter anything game-breaking, but it seems to be widespread so be warned.The biggest problem with the game lies in the level design. Early in the game, it feels great to move around the levels. However, the control scheme and movement physics were clearly designed with wide open spaces in mind, as the player character blasts around the screen absurdly fast. The level design is completely out of sync with this engine, however, as later levels rely very heavily on precision platforming on narrow platforms or through narrow spaces. The speed at which the player character moves is completely incompatible with the level of precision the game expects from you, which leads to immense frustration, especially in the second half of the game.The other big flaw with the level design comes from the jelly physics. The fun of the game comes from bouncing around the gamespace and using the jelly physics to propel yourself to new heights and the like. Why, then, does the game insist on having so many extremely narrow corridors? It doesn't make any sense and due to the bounciness these corridors are frustrating to navigate. This is even more true when you have to make a jump near a corner; the corner will always propel you diagonally away, making starting a wall climb impossible. Which wouldn't be so bad, except the game regularly forces you into this kind of position.My other main gripe with the game is the abomination of a final level (I'll keep this as spoiler free as possible). The first half isn't frustrating so much as it is tedious; you're forced to navigate extremely large levels with haphazardly placed obstacles, often being forced to take completely blind leaps and falls. The second half takes the established mechanics of the game and changes them up in tons of different ways. I won't lie, it's creative, but it makes for absolutely horrendous and frustrating gameplay. It takes the already difficult precision platforming and adds an element of near complete randomness to the equation, to the point where you just have to get a few lucky jumps to have any hope of succeeding.Overall, The Floor is Jelly is a game with a lot of great ideas, but the game never comes together to feel like a complete vision. The level design is totally at odds with the mechanics of the game, and that's a shame. It's definitely worth checking out if you pick it up at a sale price, but it's absolutely not worth the $10 price tag."

The controls are easy to learn, but takes some time to master (this might be more the fact that I'm still new to PC gaming, but that's still something to consider).  The levels vary in difficulty, flip-flopping from hard to easy on some occasions. It did seem to drag on a little bit in some sections, but that wasn't too bad.It's shortly after the third hub world that the game takes a nosedive. I'm not sure what the developers were thinking when they made this design decision, but I really wish that they hadn't. They took their basic gameplay style and chucked it out the window in favour of what I can only assume is their attempt to be zany and wacky. Suddenly, the very concept of the game has changed and there is no consistency in the core mechanics that the player has used up until this point.Because of this, I can't recommend the game. Not at full price and not as the interesting indie title I thought it was going in."

The entire floor being Jelly gives a very unique experience and the jumping mechaniics and physics are implemented perfectly. The game involves going through various levels using the inherent ability to thrust up of the Jelly and use the momentum to get to hard to reach places. The levels are varied with the water level absolutely fun to play. There are new platforms being introduced midway in game which keeps the game fresh. Fabulous game with pretty minimalistic graphics.Absolutely worth your time. Wish there are more indie games made like this. Changing the review to negative as the second half the game is not very good and the level design is horrible with the last half particularly atrocious with respect to the game mechanics changes they have done.

The environments are so unique; sometimes you are in a cave, or space, underwater, or you are in earlier levels plus a big twist. (You'll see what I mean) Second, the music is so soothing and subtle. At one point in the game, there are flowers that you can jump on like trampolines that make a guitar note when touched. If you jump on abunch of them in a row, I swear it makes a song. Third, it's just so intricate, beautiful, immersive, and fun. You feel a lot more like you are in the world when every step you make disturbs it. Not only that, but throughout the levels you are faced with all sorts of different puzzles, and it becomes a lot more than a platformer. The trees (coral in the underwater levels) are so perfect for whatever environment they are in, and it makes a really cool effect. Not only that, but there are so many little details that makes it even more beautiful. Like, in one environment, trees would grow where you stepped, or every once-in-a-while you would come across a unique swaying house.

,Recommended,295750,28097225,"Posted: 30 November, 2016",all,Frogge,"Since I finally bought and finished the game yesterday, I figured I would drop a quick review. The Floor is Jelly is a cute yet charming puzzle platformer. The base gameplay mechanic is simple: Everything is made of jelly(though later on you may come across several objects that are not, such as flowers in the black world that make you bounce, or the tools in the rain world that rotate platforms around). While the whole concept is quite frustrating to learn at first, it eventually turns into a really fun thing to play around with. It may look at first like it'll be very simple with bland level designs, but soon you'll see that the levels become quite unique and challenging with a series of interesting puzzles and hazards.Moving on with the negatives, the game can get a little glitchy. I never got stuck in the wall like most people seem to have mentioned, but I did fall through the floor or glitch my way through some obstacles several time, especially in the white world. While most areas are fun and unique, and the two I'm about to mention are no exception, the levels can get quite quirky. The white world and therealfinal area just had me bored most of the time, begging to get them over with, therealfinal area especially. The white world was quite glitchy. While the concept idea behind it was nice, it was so hard to tell what to do, and i often found myself, like I mentioned earlier, having to glitch my way through some of the obstacles to beat the levels. The worst part is, I felt that i was actually doing the puzzles correctly, and I think puzzles that intentionally require you to glitch the game shouldn't be a thing. Therealfinal area on the other hand, isglitchy on purpose and just makes you go OH GOD MY EYES MAKE IT STOPthe entire way through. I was so glad when it was over with, because I felt like I was gonna puke if i spent any more time with the mechanic it introduced.Back to the positives, it has a very smooth, beautiful art style that plays out nicely. The soundtrack is very well done, and fits each area perfectly. It has secrets, which is always a good thing.It also follows the formula that tends to be popular with cute relaxing games: start off peaceful and get darker as you go. That void world was creepy and unexpected. Not to a point where I would consider it mind blowing, but it did somewhat surprise me. The pink area, aka the final area, was also pretty peculiar, though like I already mentioned above, very very quirky.The game has no real story from what I've seen. That is ok, as I didn't go in expecting one, and I was more than satisfied with what I was given. There is no dialogue or narration at all, or any words for that matter. The controls are good and simple. You'll only need to use the arrow keys (up makes you jump, left or right make you go... well, left or right, and down is the interaction button for a select few objects) but even so it feels compelling. It really tries delivering something new, which I can appreciate. The puzzles aren't anything too difficult that's gonna make you tear your hair out... with the exception of that one puzzles in the rain world. That darned Cat-Flower puzzle. It's a very clever puzzle, but at the same time it's so hard, I actually spent 30+ minutes trying to solve it when I eventually gave up and just looked up a walkthrough. Well played, developer sir or ma'am.All in all, I'd highly recommend The Floor is Jelly if you enjoy puzzle platformers, or if you just want a little game(I say little but 2-3 hours isn't THAT short, haha) to play."

,Recommended,295750,17116034,"Posted: 18 July, 2015",all,Literary Video Games,"The Floor Is Jelly places the player in a beautiful world composed entirely of—you guessed it—jelly.  This translates to gameplay in a variety of ways, but most notably the player gains momentum by bouncing off the gelatinous ground and walls.While this sounds like a fantastic set-up for an intense platformer, developer Ian Snyder shies away from that approach.  Instead, the majority of The Floor Is Jelly involves loose experimentation in order to solve puzzles.  Although there are a few difficult platforming sequences—especially as the story progresses towards its conclusion—this game focuses more on experimentation than frustration.  This style of gameplay works well—instead of appearing as yet another Super Meat Boy clone, The Floor Is Jelly establishes an identity in a crowded 2D platformer market.The relaxing, relatively easy gameplay meshes perfectly with the game's art and music.  The minimalist world pulses with energy, and the soft soundtrack (produced by Disasterpeace) fits the art style perfectly.  I would go so far as to say the simple beauty of The Floor Is Jelly turns playing these levels into a mild stress relief.That said, this is not a game without flaws.  Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of The Floor Is Jelly lies in the game's complete lack of story.  I love plots hidden in abstractions, but Snyder's game doesn't even go so far as to announce itself as a generic love story.  Instead, the player is left with bright colors and the wanderings of an odd shape. My other two complaints warrant less attention, but I still wish they had been addressed: first of all, The Floor Is Jelly does not offer controller support.  The arrow keys work well enough, but I greatly prefer using my Xbox controller.  Secondly, the ten dollar price tag may be seen as too high for a game that takes between two to four hours to beat.Other than the lack of story—my only serious concern with this game—there isn't much to critique about The Floor Is Jelly.  Ian Snyder took a common concept and transformed it into a standalone game.  The excellent design, combined with the incredible art and music, turn this into a game worth checking out.FINAL SCORE: 8.3/10This review was written for Literary Video Games.

The Floor is Jelly has very nice visuals if you haven't already noticed from the trailer above.  It also has fantastic music, I espescially loved the song in the first few levels.  The game's mostly non-linear map was a very fun one to explore, I just wish it was six times bigger.  Anyways, if Ian happens to read this review, I want him to expand the game, or make a sequel.  I also liked how this game had no official story, it was just a world made of jelly for you to explore, filled with trees, bushes, and more.  I recommend the game, to those who appreciate a fun whimsical journey, through a strange new world!"

The soundtrack and visuals are beautiful.My only complaints are that some of the final few levels feel more like random chance if you make it rather than skill, and I couldn't figure out how to change the aspect ratio to 16:9 so there were annoying black bars on either side of the screen.Overall a very nice game that you can finish in an afternoon or two, but still worth the very low price."

You play as a little creature jumping across jelly floors that make you bounce high if timed correctly.  You go through a fwe zones.  Each zone has a different and fun gimic.  The controls are perfect, very responsive and allow for easy movement in the air after you jump.  The graphics are beautiful.  They are very colorful and unique.  each zone has its own very specail color scheme made up of bright colors which give the game a very fun atmosphere.  The story is non-existant, but this is the type of game that is fine without one.My only major criticism is the game's length.  It took me 5 hours to beat on my first playthrough.  This is the saddest part.  The game was so fun and creative that it really left me wanting more.  I hope the devs expand this game with free updates (no DLC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t).  If this game was 8-10 hours long, it would be perfect.  Anymore than this would make the game tiring.All-in-all, good game.  Smooth controls, creative levels, and nice atmosphere are its pros, but its lenght is a big con.I give it an 8/10"

The game gets matching the soundtrack to the level design down to a science, and the color scheme is breathtaking. The contrast of the calming atmosphere and the cataclysmic rage of some of the levels blends together perfectly and brings out the true beauty and potential of indie games. Just a tip, if you do purchase this, near  the end if something happens that's peculiar, it is not a glitch. :D"

Sometimes the controls made me want to smash things, but I kept on playing because it's very compelling and I wanted to finish it. But people should know going in that some mechanics are just unnecessarily frustrating. By the time I got to them I was already invested in this game and wanted to love every aspect of it, so this was ultimately disappointing, and the ending of the game just escalated my negative feelings. However, I'm still giving it a thumbs up, I just wanted to warn people if they happen to read my review - you will have fun, but you will get angry.As much as I enjoyed this game and would like to get all the achievements, the controls are bad enough that I'm unfortunately going to pass on this achievement hunt. It's already uninstalled."

I haven't finished the game yet but so far the levels haven't been that challenging, which is what I see in quite a lot of platformers."

Controller support was inconsistent and the game lagged and sped up erratically, despite exceeding the minimum specs (though admittedly not by much). Each region focuses on a different mechanic or technique, which kept the levels feeling fresh and appealing through the whole game. It's fairly short. I'd like to replay it for some of the achievements on a computer that can handle it."

,Recommended,295750,33815885,Posted: 26 July,all,Microsoft PowerPoint,"This is very fun (if short) indie platformer. The basic gameplay consists of platforming, except all the levels are made of jelly. That means they bounce a lot, and as a result you bounce a lot. I didn't mind how short it was, actually. It never outstays its welcome, and it always brings fresh ideas to the table, so you're never bored of the actual gameplay.The reason I can't recommend it is the performance. As soon as you get to the end (you'll know when you're there), the game grinded to a halt. I went from 60+ fps stable to 11-16 fps during the last hour or so of the game. It got so bad that I actually couldn't do the ending, because it involves some gameplay tied into the frames, and it just wouldn't run for me.EDIT: I have changed my review, as I seem to have found a workaround. I can't guarantee it'll work for everybody, but I restarted the game when it stuttered, and it seemed to have fixed the problem for me."

But it's really not all bad, certainly a tolerable way to expend a small portion of one's limited lifespan.Overall my feelings towards the whole experience is neutral.EDIT: It is possible to bypass the walking dead scenario via savegame editing, which I managed to do. Check the forums for a solution. Another problem with this game I have observed is variable game speed (the player will move faster or slower according to how much load is on the system at the time), which also impacts playability and enjoyability."
