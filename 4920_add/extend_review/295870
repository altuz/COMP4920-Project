It was recorded before it was on Steam, but the info should still be pretty accurate.The dungeoning features rock hard difficulty, fluid feeling controls, and simple graphics. This is one of my personal favorite rogue-like/lite games. I love how easy it is to get into, but difficult to master. I've already finished the game once, and currently working on game+.Overall it's a fun light romp, that could have you coming back for more.Positives:- Easy to understand mechanics- Fluid feeling controls- Will challenge the player- Multiple ""Game+"" for replayNegatives:- Might be too simple looking for some- Might be too hard for some- Could use more options and features"

Randomly generated dungeon?  Difficult but fair gameplay?  Inspiration from the 'Souls' series?  A liking to Legend of Dungeon?  Take my money!But don't let any of these fool you.  What you get is an overpriced, bare-bones, sleep-inducing and repetitive game.  This really needs to be labeled as Early Access because there's nothing to this game for the price-tag.  I'm sure the developer has plenty more to add in the future but as of the time of this review, this game has nothing to keep you interested for more than 3 hours, max.The dungeon itself is very uninspired.  The weapons all function exactly the same.  Every sword, every bow, every staff... exactly the same.  You cannot sell nor even DROP any of your weapons, so prepare to be battling with scrolling through your weapons the whole way through.  There's no armor drops, so zero customization there, and the stats are boring and should probably just automatically upgrade instead of making you pause the game, go into your menu, and add one point into a stat which doesn't make you feel any cooler, stronger, or tougher.There is some enemy variety, but it takes way too long before you encounter the next new mob.  A lot of the mobs, especially early on, are too boring to fight.  Unless you think fighting a bunch of plants that can't move or attack is fun.This game needs a lot more time to be fleshed out, and then it might be a decent amount of fun.  Right now, however, I would recommend you save your hard-earned money."

I hope the developer sticks with the project long enough for maybe a graphical upgrade, and maybe souls style multiplayer? Exploring a dungeon and seeing enemy players challenging you for your weapons/gold would be exciting.Improvements that the game needs-Smoother UI,The menu system feels very dated, I'm not sure if this was on purpose but I thought it was just frustrating. there's not even a way to use your cursor when playing with a keyboard.-Proper Controller SupportThe game advertises controller support but this does not seem to be the case, the game would crash if I even moved my anaglog stick which seems to be a problem many players are having.To the developer I hope you stick with the game and make it the best it can possibly be.

I've heard that some poeple has hinted that it's like a 2D Dark Souls but I would disagree with part of that statement, whilst on the other hand I can see where they are coming from.  Being a Rogue-Lite platformer, what really matters is how the game controls and I can happily concur that it controls really well & on par to Super Meat Boy which means when you die, it's generally your fault and not the fault of the game in any way.  The other element is the RPG part, you gain experience through killing the various different types of foes and pick up loot through looking in chests & destroying barrels.  The game in my opinion is a little short with only about 16 levels but there is a New Game+ to keep you coming back to see if you can beat the game again even though it's a little harder this time.  On the whole, I'm really pleased with the game & have enjoyed playing & would recomend it to anyone"
,Recommended,295870,10964004,"Posted: 29 June, 2014",all,Orrus,"Calling The Dungeoning ""Spelunky Souls"" is spot on.  The combat and platforming feels like a less polished Spelunky, while the pace and ""learn from mistakes"" difficulty mirrors that of Dark Souls.The Dungeoning is a pretty short game, consisting of only 3-4 tilesets over 16 floors of the dungeon.  A full run only takes about 60-90 minutes.Encounters with enemies are very similar to Dark Souls, in that enemies seen unfair and daunting until you learn their attack patterns. Mastering how to react to and counter enemies will let you breeze past them in subsequent play throughs.The sword play is skillful and satisfying.  Bows, slingshots, and wands each provide different projectile trajectories making all 3 useful in different situations.  You will switch weapons very often depending on the dangers at hand.You have a shield, but it is only effective against projectiles, and only in a small frontal arc.  Unfortunately this makes blocking much less effective than simply dodging.There are no time limits, so much like Dark Souls you are free to slow down, take your time, and study each encounter before diving in.Every run is a fresh start, as there is no meta-progression.  This works quite well for The Dungeoning.  Progression is satisfying because when you get farther than before you know it is because YOU as the player got better.Pros:+Unforgiving but predictable enemy behaviors and attacks.+Nice pixel sprites that aren't too stlized.+Loot!  In the form of weapons, shields, rings, and consumables.+Visually stunning particle FX and lighting.+Great 8-bit pixel sounding SFX.+Short.+New Game Plus mode.Cons:-Clunky, difficult to navigate menus.-Meager character leveling options.-No save system, so a game winning run must be done in one sitting.-Consumables are slightly too abundant.-Awful video and control options typical of cheap indie titles.-No Steam achievements.Fun to beat once in a few hours if you can pick this game up for a few bucks.  I'd gladly play through this game again if more content is released."

The controls are (for the most part) rock solid and the gameplay is fantastic. The art style is enjoyable, and I LOVE the music. Two marks against it are inventory management, and a lack of rebindable movement keys. The invintory tends to clutter up with old useless tat that I can't seem to get rid of. All of the other keyboard keys CAN be rebound, but not the movement ones. I hate using the arrow keys, so I had to resort to autohotkey (binding of isaac method much?) to reconfigure my keys.

The sytle of the retro art is great. The unique ememies you come across are creative.Maybe it's the leveling up that I like or the ability to keep weapons or discard them so you feel like your customizing your character. Each weapon will have a different effect and there aren't just swords, but bows, mages staffs which shoot magic, health bonuses, and leveling up your characters abilities over-all. And I like that it doesn't spoon feed you and tell you what each weapons damage rating is - you have to figure it out for yourself and experiment.All of these elements make this rogue-like more intersting so I keep coming back for more, more dungeoning that is!"

It is a difficult game, which I am personally a fan of, (though I know many others get frustarted easily and may be annoyed by the difficulty), and I feel a lot of the games fun comes from good gameplay and difficult levels. This is an early access game, so obviously many things will be added to the game in time. But there are a few things I would like to see added to the game. First, some bosses. While I found each level to be a challenge, I was dissapointed to see no big bosses. So I look forward to that hopefully being implemented. Also, some sort of stats for wepons in item descriptions would be nice. Maybe even add some new characters with different starting stats and weapons like dark souls?

I ended up using the numpad for most of the keybinds just to keep action buttons on the right side and movement on the left. It seems that most of the reviews stating 'fluid' or 'solid' controls are either used to arrow key movements or are more likely using a gamepad.Gamepad or autohotkey required with this game for those that prefer a WASD setup.No complaints beyond the controls
,Recommended,295870,11151170,"Posted: 9 July, 2014",all,Reckoning,"My time with this game has been short and sweet.  I write this review both with praise, and as a caveat.  I found this game during the Steam Summer Sale and it did not disappoint in the traditional sense -- that is, I had a lot of fun in the short time I spent with The Dungeoning.That being said, let me clarify some things.  Despite being a permadeath game, I found the learning curve fairly straightforward and the deaths in general to not be an issue.  I believe I died twice before completing the game, once on the first floor due to just starting the game with utter inexperience, then again on the fifth floor due to the difficulty curve pushing upwards in creative manners.Monsters pay experience (and occasionally coins) and this allows you to level (and potentially buy items from merchants later) one of four stats: Strength, Defense, Vitality, and Magic.  I did not end up using Magic at all in my run with the game and just focused on raising Stregth and Defense mostly, with a slight nod toward Vitality.  There are scrolls you can find in chests that may boost your stats as well, so that's a nice find.The character's controls are fairly fluid, though occasionally a bit spastic.  The hero moves fairly quickly and the swings they use have nice range to them.  The bow and slingshot both operate nicely and allow for depth in terms of how you approach enemies, provided you have sufficient ammo (which you will, if you don't stick with just one weapon).  Again, I never used magic, so I have no comment on staves in general.  The hero has several ""tricks"" that you can utilize involving jumps or swings based on movement input.  Also, jumping is a little peculiar but has a nice feel once you get used to it.  The hero really does feel pretty loose when moving about and I must say that for all the times when I had an issue because of a mis-jump or a bump into an enemy, I never really felt like it was anything short of my mishandling of the controls.  I do wish you could drop straight off ladders or attack while on them, but that's a minor gripe at best.The enemies are not plentiful by any means, but they are diverse enough to offer a fair challenge throughout the game.  There are no bosses or minibosses.  Sorry, folks.  In fact, the game ends rather abruptly when you find the item you've wandered into this lair to search for in the first place.  There is a New Game+ mode, but I haven't messed with it yet.  From what I gathered, it's mostly the same fare at a higher difficulty -- which is nice, given that one usually plays procedurally generated dungeon games for the replay value anyway.The graphics are pretty bland, though the lighting is nice at times (I actually enjoyed wearing the green glowing ring, which left a nice green ambient glow around your character that lit up the general area a little better or worse, depending on your perspective).  The sound effects are par for the course.  The music is where it's at.  Other than a strange lack of music on my last run through on Floor 2, there were some pretty awesome iterations of music that varied between levels.I cannot state this enough, but the game is very short -- exploring every secret passage in my last run and killing nearly every enemy left me at about 90 minutes of playtime.  This is a bit disappointing, especially since there are a number of different background level changes that happen from about Floor 5 onward, so I kinda felt like the game would be made up of blocks of levels that changed backgrounds and aesthetics to let me know I was making progress; instead, it was simply another background/level theme change every few levels after Floor 5.  I don't know if there is a defined set of levels.  If there are, I finished the game on Floor 16, I believe.So there is my caveat -- the game is very short, despite being extremely fun.  I don't like recommending taking away from a developer's overall profits, but this game really is too short to be worth almost $10, except for the most committed Rogue-ish players who want to see as many variants as possible after beating the game.  I do not regret my purchase, and would urge anyone who has an interest in this sort of game to get it when it's on sale, because it is definitely worth it at any sale price.  Here's to hoping the developer goes back and adds more to the game, but it's worth a look either way if it's available on a budget price."

No not repetitive like the addicting Rogue Legacy or Binding of Isaac, those games atleast had boss fights and unlockables to keep it interesting. All this game has is every couple of levels you will see a new type of mob (exciting stuff).Despite other reviews mentioning the challenge and difficulty of this game, It was surprisingly easy after about 10 minutes of adapting to the combat style. It also helps that at anytime you can pause the game to munch down on food for health Skyrim style.In short, if you are into mind numbingly simple and repetitive games like 'Legend of Dungeon', you might find this game good for killing some time, otherwise I would look elsewhere."

Nice lighting effects, particle effects, blood spatters, treasure chests, etc..The bad: Character movement doesn't really feel right, almost like skating just so you'll accidentally bump into that next monster around the corner or falling ceiling block. Maybe I'm just more adjusted to games that aren't trying so hard to get you killed.There's no ""save and exit"" option. What if you're just tired of playing? Is it roguelike because it's supposed to be roguelike or is it because they couldn't figure out how to store character and inventory data?There are only 16 levels with 4 variations.You can't destroy traps, even with explosives.It's difficult to tell which item/weapon is more powerful. Sure you can attack boxes, plants, etc.. to test swords, but it's very hard to tell just exactly what rings do, and their descriptions don't help much. Neither do the not-so-helpful abbreviations.There's not really any point to spending your levels on anything other than defense.At the end is a big sparkly chest with a trophy in it. You unlock new game+. I doubt I'll ever want to finish that. It seemed like it was a little more difficult, but I can't see any point in playing through again.Bottom Line: There's nothing here to keep me coming back. It might keep you busy for 2 hours, but it will ultimately feel like a hollow and unrewarding effort.If you want a more RPG-like side-scrolling game, then you might prefer Unepic. If you'd rather throw a few minutes of your life away while feeling completely unrewarded, then go ahead with this game.It wouldn't be bad at $2, but $5.99 is a ripoff, which is what I paid. It's too bad Steam doesn't offer refunds.Other notes:Keys. What's the point with all these keys? What if I run out? Will I be unable to move on? I hope there's at least one on each level. But really the keys seem mostly pointless unless there's always at least one per level in an attempt to make you get the key before moving on.Edit: I did run out of chest keys, but I believe there is always a door key on every level."
