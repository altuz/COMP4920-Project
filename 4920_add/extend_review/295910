It's not a metroidvania, it's just pure arcade platform with no backtracking. Just levels to beat one after another.PROS:-Nice pixel art.-Fast gameplay.-Well done boss fights.-Satisfying final battle (if tough).-Simple and effective magic system.CONS-The main character has way much momentum in her moves. Difficult to navigate or step on small plats sometimes.-Barrier magic is unuseful.-You're likely to get hit when navigating downwards.-Way too short.Am I seeing a sequel with tons of looting, magic and more weapons with the same arcade premise?"
,Not Recommended,295910,22311340,"Posted: 8 April, 2016",all,ExtraMan,"There are some things that I really, really liked about Olympia Rising, and some things that really, really frustrated me.First off, the good things.Chaining together combos feels great, it makes you feel like a mighty warrior and bonus coins make the entire thing an incredible joy when the combo is over and you are rich.The exspansive, well put together levels that I loved to explore, running around and grabbing coins, fighting things, finding treasure rooms, all of that was great. If the whole game was just these levels, I would have so much fun with them.Keeping your extra coins when you finish a level. A small thing, but it still felt really good. The game rewarded me for taking my time with a level, exploring all the nooks and crannies, and finding all the hidden treasure. It also created hope that eventually I would get so many coins that I could skip a level entirely because I can already pay the next fee. If I ever did this, it would have been amazing.Now, the not so good things.Enemies That Take More Than One Hit. Now, I realize that eventually, there has to be an enemy that takes more than one hit, but this breaks the pacing of the game. Before you find an enemy, you're jumping around and racking up a huge combo, after you find the enemy the combo is over. Everytime I saw minotaur/ice warrior/lamia/wizard/turret head/thing that I couldn't kill in one hit I knew that the combo, which was the fun part, had ended. A nice work around for this would be if the higher a combo the player had, the more damage they deal. This would mean that the game rewards the player for working an Enemy That They Can't Kill In One Hit into their combo, instead of punishing them for finding it.Terrain That Looks Like The Background. This was something I kept finding, and everytime I did it was confusing. Normally, the background is dark and what you can walk on is bright. This game has dark background, bright terrain, and darkish other terrain that you cannot jump up through. This becomes such a hassle, trying to check where you can and can't go, in moments when I'm trying to hurry because lava death is flooding the level.Levels That Flood With Lava Death. These things were a massive cause of frustration, because of what these levels try to be. They are expansive, well put together that I would love to explore and collect all the coins, but they are on a timer. This means I cannot explore the level or I risk death, I cannot collect coins or I risk death, I cannot search for hidden treasure or I risk death, and I cannot blindly jump combo through the level just trying to finish it as fast as I can or I might not have enough coins by the end. One of two things needs to be removed from the rising levels, either the coin number or the timer. Having both turns the level into a stressful, memory game. The first run of a rising level, I told myself ""I am going to lose all my bonus coins."" I knew that I would win eventually, but only when I had run the level so many times that I knew exactly which way to go and where enough coins were.Slippery, Slidey Shoes. This was a problem on two occasions, when I was pushing through a rising level, and when I was trying to avoid the next issue.Touch Damage. I know that touch damage is a staple in videogames, that enemies are not things I should be getting near. However, I mostly only have melee and there are some enemies that don't make sense to deal touch damage, like birds that are trapped in them sized cages. The other place this becomes a problem is with bosses, because bosses can suddenly change the size and shape of their hitbox. This doesn't feel like taking damage, this feels like being robbed of a health point.You Cannot Use Magic After A Double Jump. This sounds minor, and it is, but the thunder magic is the only way to increase melee damage and reset jump combos. When I find an enemy with two health in a jump combo, I use the thunder magic to kill it and continue the combo, unless I need to double jump to get to it in which case the combo ends.That's mostly it, there's a few more things. The water magic felt worthless because you had to stop moving, the jumping attack was so much better than the standing attack that the standing attack felt worthless, exploring downward didn't feel good because I couldn't see what was under me and would frequently take damage because of that.So now, the final verdict, would I recommend this game?NO. Don't get me wrong, there's some great ideas here, the game looks nice, parts of the game feel great, but there's so many little things that just wear on the player until the game becomes unfun. I can enjoy games that are challenging, when you win then that victory felt earned, not given, but this isn't challenging. It's frustrating. If the game was challenging, the player, if they are skilled and focus, be able to beat a level on their first try. They probably won't, but the possibility should still be there. With this, there's so many death that just came from things I couldn't see, or because I got stuck on terrain when trying to jump up, or because I took damage when I turned around to attack a stationary enemy. There is good in this game, but it does not outway the game's flaws."

Oh well, I'll try to give you the highlights.Pros+graphics+sound+music+level design+boss designCons-floaty movement-small weapon hitbox and larger enemy hitbox than the visible boundaries-first boss is the most difficult enemy in the game...by several orders of magnitude-coin collection as barrier to further levels-inability to pan camera-password system (what is this, 1990? At least it looks cool)This game would be great for things like speed runs, but due to the coin collection, you're forced to backtrack through branching paths. Backtracking wouldn't be so bad, but you can't pan the camera. I've taken many unnecessary hits as a result of this. I think a timer system (one that ticks down per level and one that ticks up throughtout the game for speed runs) would be a much better system for this game. I beat it in about 2 hours. It's enjoyable enough, but the faults will keep me from returning to it. Don't let the first boss get you down -- difficulty wise, it should've been the final boss. The bosses would even be a ton of fun if not for the rediculous hit boxes. Between enemies having too large of a damaging hitbox and the protagonist having floaty controls, I died more times than was reasonable to what I feel is poor design. Level design, sound, and music are really great. The art style is pleasant and unique. Try to pick this game up in a sale if you're on the fence. I think it's worth $5, but the cons truely are frustrating. I may sound overly negative, but I hope the dev will be watching the comments and improve. Maybe I'll come back to it one day in the hopes this is the case. Considering the price point, I will still recommend this game as it stands."

Everyone else? Probably not."

I've been having such a blast playing it for the last couple hours. The levels are fun to explore using the air combo mechanic, and the enemies and boss battles bleed old-school awesomeness!

The controls are tight and the mechanic of getting a new jump every time you get a kill is inspired. Whenever you manage a long chain it's heart pounding.I will say the first boss was a pretty frustrating wall for a while there, but the game really opened up as soon as I got past that. It's very challenging but doesn't feel unfair at all.The art is also great! Feedback on hits (aside from on bosses, weirdly) is super satisfying. The environments are varied and interesting, and the sparse narritive and just enough to keep me engaged.Recommened!"

This is not a metroidvania; the levels are vertical like Metroid, but they are very open, and the object of every stage is to accrue enough coins to pay the fare to the next.  There are multiple paths, allowing you some freedom in your harvest of Hades' booty.  You can double jump, and every time you kill an enemy in midair, you get two more jumps, so you can potentially spend a lot of air time.  It starts off pretty easy but gets really tricky at the end.  It's classic arcade goodness with slick, modernish acrobatics.Olympia Risingis a fine morning tea game that is fun for multiple playthroughs despite the lack of unlockables or achievements.  It's a great pity that it did not get the attention it deserved!  I was hoping for better fullscreen support and pad support (you cannot natively use the stick, only the D-pad), but I suppose the developers lost heart because of poor sales.  Fortunately, these two issues can easily be subverted with Windows Magnifier and Joy-2-Key (just set up a profile in which only the stick is defined, and that at a threshold of 30).  Trust me, the game is well worth the price and the tweaking!(If you beat the game, make sure to pay attention to the drawings at the end, as they reveal a lot of the hidden story.)"

The only downside I can see to this game so far, is that the coins can sometimes get stuck in walls, which can be especically irrating when trying to escape acid and collect coins at the same time. However it takes away little from the gameplay, which is excellent. My favourtie thing about this game so far though is the animation in the game, as the fire spell and the sword slash looks pretty damn awesome."
,Not Recommended,295910,18507226,"Posted: 16 October, 2015",all,Mickey,"I really wanted to like this game, because initially it looked pretty cool in its movement and aesthetic, but there are too many imperfections for me to recommend this.The fun ideas that Olympia Rising has (such as the chain system) are entirely undone by the multitude of pet peeves I've encountered in the span of 90 minutes. Zero button configuration and by extension being forced to use the D-Pad on an Xbox 360 controller. Camera swivel being so overdone to the point this game is one of the few that actually struck me with motion sickness. The inability to move the camera below you when you need to descend, resulting in numerous blind jumps and making the already annoying enemy placement all the more grating when exploring. The game effectively only using two buttons on the controller yet insisting to employ down + X for special abilities, which is cumbersome for quickly moving about and simultaneously dispatching more durable enemies. Progression being gated by having to collect a specific amount of coins, only to be met with a unbearably sassy skeleton ridiculing you with unwitty remarks for every level. Inconsistent hitboxes, no health bars for bosses, shrill audio cues, ...It's a genuine shame too, because Olympia Rising isn'tterribleand the majority of these shortcomings could've been resolved through (relatively) minor tweaks."
,Recommended,295910,17193122,"Posted: 23 July, 2015",all,Cyril,"This is a pretty neat little 2D action-platformer game! The main focus here is definitely the combat, but it's designed in a way that feels pretty platformer-y as well. Killing an enemy gives you your two jumps back (reminds me of Dustforce in a way) and chaining enemies together using these extra jumps nets you more coins per enemy. The goal of each stage is to make it to the end with a certain amount of coins in tow, and the further the game progresses, the higher this number goes, and the longer the stages get. The end result is, unfortuntaely, a difficulty curve based mainly around level length, though each new world gives you an extra heart so you can survive a bit longer. Health pickups are more than sufficient, and tend to be very useful, as avoiding damage in this game is no easy feat. I never found myself having trouble getting enough coins either, if I searched around the level a little bit I ended up having more than enough. Coins can carry into the next level, too, but are lost if you die - I can see this making for some interesting speedrunning strats, certainly. I feel like this could be a pretty good speedrunning game, really, it's fast-paced and pretty challenging though never unfair. If I had to lodge a few other minor complaints, it *is* a bit short, but the game's not particularly expensive anyways. The wall jump also feels a little wonky at times (primarily around thinner platforms). I also found the music to not really fit, it's pretty forgettable and pretty minimal most of the time. Nothing huge though and I did enjoy my time with this game, as brief as it was. Will probably replay it at some point though!"
