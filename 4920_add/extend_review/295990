,Not Recommended,295990,9911900,"Posted: 23 April, 2014",all,Robin von YouTube,"[For the lazy ones: Skip the text for pros and cons.]Well, this game really looked interesting to me so I bought it. Unfortunately it's not quite as good as it looks. Why? Let's see.You are thrown onto that map with a chosen ammount of money and you buy stuff to produce energy and earn money for you. Nice start.Some of the buildings affect the pollution of the map, like gas plants or oil refineries and some don't, like solar panels. But clean energy takes forever to produce money. Does it even produce money? I get a little ""3"" on my oil drills to tell my something happens, but my clean energy just keeps looking fine... however.If you earned too much pollution accidents start to happen, like lightning, meteors or a giant worm randomly popping out of the ground destroying everything in range. When any of these desasters destroy your building the pollution stops and... yes, that's it. You rebuild it, pollution starts again, and hello Mr. Worm!You are able to clean the pollution by planting trees, but I was not able to see any difference so far. So I'm not sure how or whether these trees affect the pollution...So in fact you could just build a lot of solar panels and hope you reach the goal. Oh, ""what's the goal?"" you might ask. Well, there's a little ""?"" in the top left corner to tell you: ""To win you must make 1.000.000 Dollars"". Oh my. And all that with a solar plant that... I don't know, does it work at all!?Besides that the interface is minimalistic. Building menu, money and that nice little ""?"" top left. It would be great at least to know how much pollution my buildings produce just to plan how many trees I need to plant. But nope.Next thing very annoying is the lacking possibility of erasing the enviroment. There are trees everywhere on the map, mostly in positions that block nice building grounds. And you have a wonderfull bulldozer-tool. But guess what? You cannot erase trees you did not plant by yourself. That's somehow nature-friendly, but come on... Don't cut my choices where I want my trees! At least they got different colors for map-trees and self-made-trees. Makes it easier to remember which ones to cut down...What else? Graphics itself are really nice, I like this retro-Pokémon-look. On the other hand the music sucks. It's like a cat walking across a keyboard. With a lot of reverberation. And a bit of rhythm. Annoying to me. Well, at least you can turn the volume down from the options. That's one of three things you can do there. Sound and music volume and fullscreen-toggle. Wish there were at least some more graphics options. Or the scroll speed toggle. It's sooooo slow, jesus!The last thing is the lack of progress in the game. Yes, you can unlock new buildings, but the world itself doesn't change (except when you have problems with leaking oil... :s ). Also it would be great if you could upgrade your buildings with better filters to produce less pollution, but that simply isn't possible. In fact you can't do much more than build things. This game is called EVOPOLLUTION, but all I get is POLLUTION, where's the EVO?Guess that's it so far.Pro:- great idea- many building possibilities- making money. Who doesn't like making money?- cute worm-monster- nice retro graphicsCons:- repetitive- hard on every setting- no feedback on what you do (how does that tree affect my world?)- no instructions- always the same goal (reach 1.000.000 Dollars)- cannot bulldoze any map enviroment (like trees, seriously?)- annoying music- no growth (besides the new buildings you unlock)- would be somehow catchy, if it wasn't that hard (""Yai, I build a gas plant! ... Oh, the worm destroyed it..."" YOU JUST CAN'T STOP THAT THING!)- lack of options (sound and music volume and full screen on/off)- incredibly slow scrollingConclusion:I gave it a chance and it just didn't convince me. All in all it's a nice idea, but not much more than that. This game needs a lot more work to make it an enjoyable game you would play and also re-play. So far it's mostly frustrating. But maybe we get an update, that would be great!Until now it's a no, I do not recommend that."
,Not Recommended,295990,9912526,"Posted: 23 April, 2014",all,BastyDaVida,"Right now, this game is not in a good state. (TL;DR at the end)The aim of the game is to reach 1,000,000 credits, starting with a custom amount of credits, up to 25,000.You can affect your weekly income by building different kind of power sources, including polluting types (oil, gas, etc) and pollution-free types (solar panels, wind turbines, etc) which all generate credits. Pollution shall be the main difficulty of the game:If you build too many oil drills for example, your randomly generated world will suffer from pollution, causing e.g. lightning strikes that destroy your buildings. In order to fight pollution, you may chose to plant trees. Two types of them.This balance system is however not transparent at all. You don't get to see, how much you pollute and how much your trees help, making it hard to find a proper distribution. The only feedback you get is when catastrophes are happening, nothing else.The plantable trees are the only units that cost credits. And once again, you have no indicator showing how much you earn and how much you lose per week.The biggest downside though is how damn easy it is to win this game, even on hard mode (not the expert mode, have not tried that one). If you don't want to be spoilered, don't read the following passage.All you have to do is build wind turbines and power storages. That's it. They don't cause pollution and give you a steady income. You build them. Wait, build more, wait more, and - magic - you have 1,000,000 credits.Basically, what this game needs is a downside to the pollution-free ressources, so that the difficulty lies in finding the correct balance between fossile fuels, 'green' ressources and vegetation, instead of just.... waiting.Moreover, the whole game (featuring music, menu, interface) needs more love. It all seemstoominimalistic. In the end, this game is, without further work, no fun.I really hope that the creators will rework the game, i love the graphics and the general concept and idea of the game. There is potential. Unfortunately, it's still sleeping.TL;DR: Game needs more love, gameplay way too easy, lacks transparency in terms of credits and pollution level making it unenjoyable. Not recommended."

We haven't come across many ""business"" management games that have a emphasis on the impact on the environment. The retro graphics style caught my eye, as did the fact It was also nice to see a game on steam that wasn't in early access or shovelware from the 1990s.The game itself seems solid in theory, try to make money whilst maintaining the environment. If the land gets heavily polluted then weird stuff starts to happen, like meteors falling from the sky, or giant worms trying to destroy your precious buildings. The fact that there is random generation in the 5 maps you can choose from adds to the replayability (although the only thing I really noticed this have an impact on is the number and location of Oil Nodes).First thing I noticed, there is no tutorial to explain how to actually play the game. There is a small ""?"" in the top left which you would assume would give you some kind of help or options, but instead it just tells you that you need to accumilate 1 million dollars to win.The UI feels clunky, you can only scroll the screen with the mouse at a painfully slow speed. Good Luck finding the scroll speed on the options menu, all you get is music and sound sliders (oh sorry and full screen, can't forget that).Perhaps my main gripe with the game at the moment is the lack of display information on the buildings and such. OK, yes you can see how much a building costs, how much weekly profit you get and it's (very vague by the way) pollution output, but how much does it cost to maintain? Is there maintenance costs? The system feels very basic.It would also be nice to see some graphs of some sort. I'd like to see what my monthly profit (and expenditure) is, or how polluted the land is on average. This is the only business management game that I've come across that doesn't even have that basic functionality.Considering the game is centered around the idea of keeping a clean enviroment why can't we upgrade our buildings to produce less pollution via installing (costly) filters and such?Edit: So after playing for alittle bit longer I've found the game to mainly reward the playstyle of building nothing but buildings that cause no pollution. Apart from the fact that it takes alittle longer to reach the money goal there is no downsides to it. This seems flawed as it then gets extremely repetitive to just do the same set-up over and over again. That's rather disappointing.Most of these problems could be patched. ""If"" it does, I'll happily re-review it, until then though I won't recommend it."

Yeah there are moments where you frantically try and fix the pollution problem but once you find the right balance, all that's left to do is afk for an hour or so, or stare at your screen as your wallet slowly fills up.It's really frustrating how slow paced this game can be. Morever there's no sense of progress once you beat a level. Nothing new to unlock, no new buildings, just more of the same sitting and waiting and tweaking."

When all I got was what was essentially a one screen flash game I was more than just a little disappointed. I think this could best be summed up by an impulse buy without doing the proper research and I hope to save other people from that impulse.If you're looking for what is essentially a phone or flash game this game might tickle your fancy. If you're looking for any kind of depth or strategy...might want to look elsewhere.
,Not Recommended,295990,9924979,"Posted: 24 April, 2014",all,QQ Chuck Norris,"For the price I figured it couldn't be so bad that it'd be a complete waste of money, but unfortunately I was wrong.  I made the mistake of looking at the images and description of the game and seeing perhaps a newer version of SimEarth or something similar, and as I love simulation games figured ""what the heck"".Lesson learned, always scroll down to the reviews.  Absolutely would have avoided this if I had, as everything that was pointed out in the first few I ran into almost immediately.Oil rigs are the first things you build, in order to unlock oil tanks, then refineries, etc.  You have to build one of each building to get to the next level, although solar farms appear to unlock but you can't actually build them (bug?) without perhaps building gas plants first (which I refuse to do based on the ""VERY HIGH"" level of pollution).Oil rigs have a low level of pollution, yet within minutes the ground is brown and trees are dying, and even planting a medium tree or two (which more than take up the tiny amount of profit from the rig) makes no difference that I saw.  Clearly something that's ""VERY HIGH"" or in the case of the nuclear plant ""VERY VERY HIGH"" would just obliterate my map in seconds, right?The correct strategy is to build a number of cheap solar plants, then stack the rest of the map with power storage facilities.  No roads, no trees, just stack them.  This gives you the maximum amount of profit, and then Alt-Tab for 15 or 20 minutes and you win!Clearly this is less a game and more of a propaganda piece, as no matter what you can't actually win by using polluting types of profit, since cost of trees offsets the profits and without that you get worms and meteors up your♥♥♥♥♥"
,Not Recommended,295990,10048567,"Posted: 7 May, 2014",all,Keeper_of_Peace,"I myself enjoy this game. I think the graphics are very clean and clear. If this game was rated with stars I would give it a 3.5, and here's why:-(According to other reviews and posts) The game NEEDS a gauge showing the amount of pollution and the amount of purity. Personally, I think there should be a mode or a button to reveal that information; areas being affected by pollution, areas clear and 'healthy', etc. And these areas should be color coded to the effectiveness of the buildings and enviroment. (in this special ""mode"", it would be good to include the amount your buildings are making.)-A lot of the gameplay is very inaccurate, for example the ""Nuclear Plant"". In a real life situation, nuclear plants are in favor of the enviroment, not against.-More buildings would be GREAT! and the ability to technologically advance your tools, buildings, enviroment, and custom would be a smart decision. This would allow for a more diverse gameplay experience.I do love the game but it is missing a lot. If the devs are still with us, please see what the community has to say. Thanks! :D(I will turn my frown upside-down when I see improvement.)"

The music is chirpy and annoying for a game that requires long and considerate attention in a gaming session. Mechanics are interesting albeit shallow, also trees cost money over time to own, which is not intuitive and not obviously explained. There are 5 maps to play on, but you can plumb the depths of the gameplay on a play-through on the easiest settings of the first map, then proceed to the hardest settings on the last (mars) map and touch on everything there is to see while skipping the middle 3 maps.TL;DR Not a waste of time, but not really worth it either."
,Not Recommended,295990,10699908,"Posted: 23 June, 2014",all,LostFate,Game is simple. Easy to tell what the devs political stances are. Nuclear power creates more pollution than oil and gas combined (under normal use). Trees cost a constant flow of cash for upkeep... Scored an F- but wasn't told why (time? because they hate teh idea of nuclear so much that they just straight up fail you if you use it? Some hidden goal that isn't ever stated?)... The devs have obviously not done any research into how physics works... or they were just trying tro make a game out of half the mechanics they should have used for a real game... Would not recommend. Wish I still had the $2.50 I spent on this.
,Not Recommended,295990,15783857,"Posted: 10 May, 2015",all,The Watching Shadow,"I really wish I could recommend this game.  I really do.  The premise of it sounds really interesting, and I'm glad I got it when it was on sale (though after playing probably 90% would be more worth it instead of my 75%).  The only real good thing was a 5 card badge.  Yay badges?The premise is simple.  You have a land map.  You are to earn lots of money (1,000,000 for each map).  You can adjust difficulty and starting money.  And it seems that each one is somewhat randomized.  To get your money you have to balance the buildings you make with the pollution they create (and add trees to counteract it).  Sounds like a good start, no?However, from there it gets...awkward.  The map control is really funky (move mouse to edge of screen to pan, hold mouse wheel for faster pan, no zoom).  The difficulties don't make a lot of sense to me.  There's Beginner and Normal...but I feel like they should be switched as Beginner makes you build through the 'tech tree' (not much of one) and Normal has it all unlocked.  I've seen in other reviews a harder difficulty but not sure how to unlock it.The pollution balancing is...interesting.  You have large trees and small trees both with different upkeep (like you're paying to maintain them) which balances on your profit (other buildings) and the pollution offset.  There's no real clear indicator how much it's acting...but you can eventually get a feeling of the radius like coverage.  Easiest way I noticed was on the final area where you need to start with trees...and you see a clearer look of its effect before you can start to build.The sound/music is...attempting at a sense of ambience but it gets a little old.  The graphics are fine for cost.  They're actually kinda cute in a way.Basically, you have a Simcity without the Sims and all the pollution...and some natural disasters.  Well, somewhat natural-ish anyways: meteors, lightning...and a giant worm like from Dune?I've got no idea how the grading scale works for when you complete a map and get the 1,000,000 dollars.  Best I've done as of this review is...a D+ (lowest was an E+).  Ouch...If you get for cheap, it's an ok way to pass the time and get cards for a badge.  However, there REALLY isn't much to the game and like others have said the science is...biased, extremely biased.  I'm sorta tempted to see what the ""Hard"" is like if I can figure out how to unlock it...but I'm really not expecting much more."

Here are my thoughts and make your own decision.1. It should be more options for buildings, there are other methods of green energy other than solar and wind, so that should be expanded upon (unless it occurs in later levels im still just playing and going).2. The Purification vs. Pollution mechanic needs to be elaborated on, trees are pretty crappy at removing pollution and the pollution can accumulate really really fast! There should be options to eliminate it better.3. Nice weather and daytime mechanic for the green energy. But the night time lasts pretty long compared to day time so take that as you will.4. Pollution is difficult to control even on the easiest settings, this relates to #2 but still. There should be a gauge to allow the player to see the balance between how you pollute vs how you repair the environment."

I decided to get any fun out of this, I was just going to end it planting the most pollution inducing and just cover the world with unlivable dirt.It also seems to bug me that the music is the same throughout which gets annoying, especially from alllll the painful waiting. I guess at some point I was hoping it would change to a dark setting when you pollute the land enough but no it stays the same... which sounds weird in a world that looks really dangerous to live in.The fact that I had to wait and do other things in order to win is a poor excuse of a game.

Those will destroy trees as well which i thought was strange.

A phew things like gas and nuclear making more pollution than oil.A lot of the game doesn't make sense; it's difficult to get a grip of and the 'very hard' level is actually incredibly easy.However, I'd still recomend this game. It's been good fun."

Evopollution might seem rather difficult to play at first, but it will rope you in with indicators that you are doing fine, however in one fell swoop, you will see the lost of your industry vanish ever so quickly.  This is a good game and contains similiar elements such as Banished, however it isn't polished as it's counterpart.  It's an overall great buy for a similiar gameplay expierence for the cost.  However lacks any real connective emotions since there are no people involved in the game."

I don't feel too cheated for spending money on this game. First off, there isn't a tutorial of any kind, when you start a game. It just throws you right into it. I, personally, like the graphics. Pixel games are the best, in my opinion. The music is alright. It gets old fairly quick, but I tuned it out. One mechanic of the game that I really didn't like was how long it takes to build up money. I get that's the object of the game, to reach $1,000,000, but I feel like you have to wait too long for even $100 to build up. There's nothing to do while you wait for your money to stack up, so you can buy more things. Pollution stacks up quickly, and it seems hard to recover from.It's a neat concept, but it needs refining."
