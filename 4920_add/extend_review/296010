I normally dont get into games that dont have much storyline and are more or less team deathmatch vs. the computer, however this games pace mixed with a rather competitive AI makes it a very enjoyable experience.  The game difficulty can be adjusted to fit prefered play style and i must admit being a fan of tron the visuals in the game are very appealing."
,Recommended,296010,21381712,"Posted: 22 February, 2016",all,huw,"NeonXSZ has captured my attention in a way that games rarely seem to manage these days.  It is absolutely packed with gameplay and player choice, is highly polished and very configurable, both in terms of game settings and aesthetics (how many games do you have that let you change the theme of the game world?).It's a mouse driven 6DOF shooter (yes, mouse and keyboard isby farthe best control method) in an open world cyberspace environment, so even though you have an ultimate goal you also have a high degree of flexibility in how you achieve it.  New ship components and even new ships are introduced at the perfect rate and make you feel always like you're making steady progress.  Two (well, four) warring factions make things even more exciting...rarely do you fly for more than a minute without encountering some firefight taking place that you can ignore or join as you wish.In short, NeonXSZ is a pure joy to play.  It's pretty, it's fun, it's packed with options...if you asked me what typical 6DOF shooters need I couldn't tell you any more than NeonXSZ already has.  It's a stunning example of the genre - a revolution, really - and an incredible achievement for the one-man dev team."

Yet I STILL love this game, which is a testament to just how extremely well-executed it is.  A one-of-a-kind RPG-FPS mash-up that's refreshingly free of fluff and boring bits, due to an easily traversable game world and consistently exciting combat.  The developer is really on to something here, and I hope to see similar games released in the future-- but for now, there's nothing else like it in existence.  Absolutely check this gem out, you're getting a stupid amount of value for your money."
,Recommended,296010,11848944,"Posted: 24 August, 2014",all,Blindlight,"Pure Joy! This is not a space shooter with hard target lock, there are no asteroids to mine, this is one of the rare breed of 6DOF twitch shooters done up in glorious fashion, a treat for modern gamers and old fans of Descent and Forsaken alike. The RPG and customization elements are crazy addictive, and the alien atmosphere and soundtrack are perfect. Amazingly polished for an Early Access title. All of the settings and HUD elements can seem overwhelming at first, so can the controls (fully remappable), but part of the joy of the game is discovering and experimenting with them. EVERYTHING can be tweaked to play exactly how you like, right down to the colors of the environment and even speed of the game. Pick this one up, you won't regret it."
,Recommended,296010,22642369,"Posted: 26 April, 2016",all,applebaps,"Immediately engrossing, NeonXSZ feels like playing a more arcadey interpretation of X3: Terran Conflict on fast forward.  You're plopped into the middle of a sandbox of dogfighting, and need to gradually master all six of your degrees of freedom if you want to get anywhere.  Customizable difficulty, lots of upgrades and weapons and ships to play with, and fun challenge arenas and procedurally-generated tasks make for a fast-paced, player-driven experience.  Nice bright high-contrast visuals pay homage to Tron and are highly customizable, and the low penalty for death (at first) encourages you to keep extending beyond what you think you're capable of, to never play things too safe.What you'll discover as you get farther is that everything you're doing consumes your main currency, uranium.  Whenever you thrust needlessly, or fire weapons without thinking, you're consuming uranium, which is also used to respawn, to purchase upgrades, and to use teleporters.  You can gain it by doing tasks and killing enemies, but as you move up along the power curve, you're forced to learn more advanced, more elegant and efficient, techniques.  Failing to use your power responsibly, or trying to farm things that are way below your level for too long, could put you in danger of not having enough energy to respawn, should you die.  The way the game nudges you gradually toward both this realization and to increasing challenge and player skill is pretty brilliant."

,Recommended,296010,17582272,"Posted: 17 August, 2015",all,stephen dedalus,"As an old Freelancer player feeling at home with endless waves of nasties to hunt down for loot in your own little spaceship, NeonXSZ is an amazing breath of fresh air, making me feel at home and yet bringing in the amenities and quality of life that we have come to expect from newer games.To compensate for the lack of a 'story' you get so much more here than in Freelancer in terms of loot and customization (those who love checking all the little stats have so much to do in the in-game upgrade shops, and the loot explosions after each kill feel like Christmas: loot comes inside spherical bubbles that go with the most satisfying pop as you collect them) .The game is all about killing the bad guys,  level up and get to try out the many new unlockable hulls while upgrading the dozen or more equipment parts that keep enhancing your killing machine. So even if you have the option of picking up standard kill or fedex missions at every shop, the point is to get into the action and, well, kill the bad guys.With every hour I played I came to appreciate more and more the incredible care and skill with which the (interactive) cockpit has been designed, conveying a huge amount of information without it ever feeling cluttered (I wish flight simulator cockpits were optimized like this!). The graphical quality of the environment and the effects is astounding and makes this EA game totally feel like an AAA title (let alone that I have never met with a single bug since I bought it). Adding to this, you can even customize the environment colors so that nothing will hurt your eyes as you hunt (including flipping the color of the enemies to a different high-contrast choice).There is no standard in-game tutorial but the learning curve is very gentle because the low level enemies are push-overs and, besides, you can customize the difficulty curve to just where you like it (even the travel speed can be lowered, so that you don't need to be worried about this being a twitch-game that shuts you off if you lack Korean-like reflexes. The many colorful, detailed in-game help pages have been added recently and provide all the information one needs, and the rest can always be learned from exploration and trial and error (it helps that the death penalty is very mild, inviting you to go back into the action with no regrets). So even if the ultra-detailed cockpit may at first overwhelm, don't worry, keep killing the bad guys because it will grow on you and one day you will be able to immediately find the info you need where you want it.Finally, speaking of levels and longevity, I have been taking in the sights and enjoying the leveling-up of my ships' components, so that after 16 hours I am still at level 12 or so, while I understand that one can work it up to 80! Seems like a huge amount of play value to me and so, summing it up, now that I recently passed the 500 game mark in my Steam collection I have never before seen a 'small' indie game done with such an incredible attention to detail and one that I could more sincerely recommend to all loot-addicted space flight fans in need of a high-quality fix. I know that we have been repeatedly disappointed by a number of Freelancer lookalikes in the past several years, so while we wait why not take this gift of a perhaps less ambitious, yet amazingly satisfying game?If anything in this review resonates with you, please do yourself a favor and give NeonXSZ a try - it won't cost you a dime, and it will probably suck you in."

Inertia might be great for a wide open realistic space sim, but in a corridor based 6DOF game it's actually kind of a nightmare.  There is however an auto-braking option, which acts a sort of inertial dampener.  This improved my experience greatly.Anyway It's pretty fun.  Upgrade system is a neat twist.  Good music.  Weapons feel and sound cool.  Explosions are satisfying.  Nice ship designs.  Some solid ship management as well.  Gear has mass and power usage, etc."

If you just need to shoot things or want a good RPG without a super confusing plot, this is the game for you.Edit:Half way through this turned into a 3d maze racing game.

I don't find this mechanic fun at all.  It is extremely frustrating and boaring.  I had to change my rating to not recommended.  I've been working on one of these stupid things for two hours now.

The default controls might work for someone, but not me. Don't get frustrated early on if you're not used to this type of game. Stick it out, it's worth it. The visuals are sweet, the music is good.

I really like the developers choice to make the game as easy or as hard as suites your mood at the time. The balance between difficulty and boring is really well done. Finally, the ability to reskin and change the look of the whole game is pretty cool and helpful in different lighting conditions.The developer says it's ""early access"", but it feels more like a complete game to me. No real show-stoppers bugs, nothing that doesn't feel ""complete"". In short, it's not the sort of ""early-access"" where you are a beta tester and have to go to the googles to figure out work arounds or where your save games will be deleted on a regular basis.I feel like this game is very appropriately priced and worth the money.I suppose the only critique I have for this game is that, as of now, it doesn't have much integration with steam. No achievements, cards or workshop support. Perhaps this is what the developer means by early access?"

,Recommended,296010,31312935,Posted: 22 April,all,Damienfr,"This game is AMAZING! it's basically like most RPGs. you choose your fighting style, you choose your ship, weapons, etc. You kill things. you get a prize. lots of prizes.Not a lot of grinding is really neccessary, but if you want to, it's really worth it. I can compare it with going on a RAMPAGE in GTA 5. JUST KILL EVERYTHING...but beware kiling factions.basically you take control of a ship that has 6 dimensions of travel. 6DOT. up down left right forward backwards. it's great. you can trust me. I have big hands.There is a SLIGHT learning curve, but once you get it, it's simple. after an hour i stopped bumping into things.You play a program in a computer. you can be good(anti-virus) or be bad(virus). Areas are separated by level, so if you want a challenge, fight higher levels, but BEWARE...some of these little shi7s will chase you...be aware. If you don't want a challenge, fight lower levels. Fighting at lower levels is like going into beast mode. The body count is HIGH!addicting. fun. time flies. you can get on here and lose track of time. It's one objective to the next. The objectives are finished quickly but can be complex. Honestly, I was thinking about this game at work today. It's really quite satisfying to play.it's DEFINITELY worth $15.I thought about whether I should for an entire week...and YES $15 is nothing for how good this game is."
,Recommended,296010,21398569,"Posted: 22 February, 2016",all,timleftwich86,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzrHK0xbts0So, I have always been a big fan of flying and shooting. It's honestly what I dream about at night. Growing up playing games like Terminal Velocity and Raptor, I loved taking down enemies and having their guts spill out with that oh-so-delicious loot.Enter NeonXSZ:This 6DoF gunship-shooter is absolutely fantastic on almost every level. From a gameplay perspective: the combat feels tight, responsive, and impactful. The movement is crisp, clean, and fluid. The enemies are predictable when they should be and brutal when you get in over your head. It becomes very satisfying to, like a small fish in a huge pond, creep along to your appropriate feeding grounds and lay waste, only to escape before the bigger predators lumber along to peck you off like the easy picking you are. It then becomes even more satisfying to turn around on those same buttmunches who drilled you into the ground earlier and blow them out of the sky. And even the loot itself is well designed. Does the enemy ship have that thing on it? It'll drop that thing. Every time. Well... parts of it anyway.The UI is very daunting at first, but easily understood once you take the time to pause, by simply right-clicking I might add, and take a look around. You're a pilot, damnit! Not a surgeon! You have to orient yourself with the tools before you go off willy-nilly. This can be one of the pitfalls of the game. There is no real ""tutorial"" to speak of, other than just reading the manuals in the menu. Like any roguelike, you learn the hard way. By exploding. Over and over again. The various missions you take on will lead you across the entire map, leading you to sometimes choose between a quick ship, or a hearty ship.And the world... My gods, the world. First of all, I love the aestetic. You're inside of a computer. Of course it looks like that. And since you have the ability to customize the colors, to an extent, of both your ship and the world itself, you'd be hard pressed to find a style you DON'T like. And that's to say nothing of the expansiveness of it.Overall, I would say that NeonXSZ is a must-have for anyone who loves Diablo-style loot, tight flight mechanics, bright lights and fancy colors, or any combination of the three. And at a $20 price point, you'll be making a smart investment.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzrHK0xbts0"

76561198030574691,Recommended,296010,14056233,"Posted: 18 January, 2015",all,Agnostic Avocado,"This game is an excellent, though fairly simple shooter. At least at first glance. Based on the omni-directional shooting mechanics of Descent, this game has you placed in a wheel-like, radial cyberspace map filled with allies and enemies. The story is also very uncomplicated, to the degree where I'm not too aware of what it is. It seems that you are battling malware entities in a cyberspace environment, but I could be very wrong.The keystone for this game is the combat, which is very good. There are a wide variety of weapons, ships, and special modules for said ships, making customization nicely nuanced for your speedy little fighter whizzing across the map. There is a strightforward progression system, where your engines, shields, and fuel expand continually through mods you gain from killing enemies. It's very old-school Diablo in its loot-based gameplay: Kill enemeis, get upgrades, kill bigger enemies.The combat ranges from flying through cyber-tunnels while blasting enemies with a lightning gun to engaging with intense dogfights with four or more foes in enclosed, contsantly shifting arenas. It feels excellent, and the game tracks your stats with every inevitable death, allowing you to track your skill as well. The ships UI is also really cool, letting you customize it to a very fine degree. Also, you can chnage your ships, and the environment's colours any time you want. That had to be mentioned.The flaws are few, and given this game's early-access status, still potentially resolvable. First, the lone map, though generates the locations of bases and ""cities"" with every load, can get repetitive rather quickly. More maps, or a larger map, would go a long way to making this game last much, much longer. Secondly, having more missions, goals, tasks and objectives in between the awsome combat could help elongate the experience too. Misisons do exist, yes, but they are few and far between, and I had trouble finding them.To recap:The game has an exccelent visual style, excellent combat and progressions, decent sound design and insane levels of customization.However, the lone map and few objectives make the game feel a tad empty, though both could be fixed over time with little problems.Overall, This game is awsome, and deserves way more attention than it's getting.EDIT: The map scenario isn't too bad when you consider the arena challenges, after playing some more."

I could have read the help menu in the interface but decided to wing it. I picked my ship from a choice of 3 and off I went, flying around in a station and getting my butt kicked. To be honest, I found it fun... it gave me a feeling that I hadn't felt since the NES when I played games such as Metroid and Solar Jetman which I didn't have the manuals for: exploration. Not only of a level or map, but of the game itself. It didn't take me too long to figure out what the game was about.You are in some kind of computer system which is represented by a space station with corridors and rooms. In this space station there are 4 different factions. You have the good guys which are the operating system and anti-virus, and the bad guys which are virus and malware. Each factions files or programs are represented by ships. Some carry harmful malware around while others attack programs of the opposing factions. You are caught in the middle of this war but luckily are aligned with the OS/Antivirus to begin with.The idea of the game is simple: fly around in your ship and kill stuff, pick up their debris which will allow you to research and eventually use the modules and hulls that they are using. Acting on this idea, at least to begin with, is difficult, as you are going to get killed by ships which are higher level than you. A lot. I didn't mind this though... I quickly understood that attacking anything that was more than a level above me would end badly, so I searched for lower level enemies. After getting my♥♥♥♥♥kicked for a little while, running away from higher level programs that were gunning for me, I found myself being able to fend for myself a bit more. After a while longer, I felt like I could at least give as good as I got, and a little while longer, I was king of that space station and any Virus or Malware stupid enough to cross my path was in deep trouble and I was ready to go to the next tier of space station. That's the thing: there is a massive snowball effect in this game with regards to levelling. After the initial teething problem at the beginning of any tier, you are going to be outgunned for a while, but once you begin to claw your way up, you will be dominating in no time. It's oh so addictive and a lot of fun, if a little repetitive: something which is not really too big a deal for me, I don't mind grinding.It's a great game but if I had any complaints, it would be that every station feels the same. It's the same central hub with the same corridors and same bases; it would be nice to see some variations in layout - it also seems to me that every time you log into the game, the bases will have switched positions randomly around the map. Not a huge problem but just a bit unnecessary. I'd also like the ability to assault enemy bases and defend my allies' bases. Sure you can take over the central hub but that doesn't really do anything apart from net you some rewards. It's quite obvious to me that this game is perfect for some kind of territorial conquest side to it, but no matter, maybe someday we will see a mod or dlc for that.In summary, if you like space simulator type games, grinding for new and shiny loot to help you find even newer shinier loot, you will love this game. I do expect that most people would get bored of the repetition before they reach the last space station though, but at least you'll get your money's worth first."

,Recommended,296010,17625283,"Posted: 19 August, 2015",all,Anita Medic,"Overall, the game is fantastic. It really does build and put a twist on Descent's game mechanics with taking pieces of upgrades from destroyed ships and collecting them until you've got all the pieces, then equipping them at a docking station. Though, unlike Descent, there are enemies that you have no chance of killing on your own, which is where the reinforcements call comes in handy if you have allies close by that will help.The only problem this game has is the CPU side of things. When I turned up my MSAA to max, checked all the checkbox graphics options, increased the light slider from 4 to 5, and decreased the render distance from 4000 to 3500, my gtx670 seemed to not even need to run at it's stock clock speed, but that's because my 3770K CPU was technically maxed out. But to be fair, they did spend a lot of time to optimize the CPU side already and it still runs at a good frame rate with those setting changes."

I keep knocking against the walls. The game tells me not to worry about knocking against the walls but if it doesn't matter the game really shouldn't flash the entire screen red whenever it happens. Like the devs don't seem to know the language of the medium. Red screen flashes mean ""you are getting damaged"", not ""you are getting tickled"".I gave the game an hour of my time to reveal itself. This should be more than enough time, but the combat was too simple and provided little opportunity for strategic play. The upgrade system might have provided an opportunity to strategize outside of combat, but I really do not have time to wait multiple hours for the game to start being fun.I guess, bluntly, it's grindy. If you like filler missions rewarded with fake money, go ahead. If you just want to play a fun, interesting game right away, don't bother, you wont have the patience to wait for it."

Almost all of the 'differentness' in this game is a difference of quantity or scale rather than a difference of quality. Progression is grindy, and it's about as 'on rails' as you can get in a sandbox."

,Not Recommended,296010,23829632,"Posted: 26 June, 2016",all,oohhboy,"The core gameplay the combat, just isn't satisfying, lacks tightness or feedback and movement is a mess that can’t make up it’s mind. Maybe using a flight stick was causing this as it might not have been designed for it in mind. Having to deal with massive multi-ship fights didn’t help, allies or not.It isn't helped that you are dumped not knowing where you are and the sameness of everything is less than helpful. Bumping into walls causing a shield flash is most irritating.The loot grind mechanic just doesn't appeal to me in the slightest. The sheer number of statistics is just not newbie friendly. The lack of clear goals or objectives mean guiding the player is a non-starter. You are already going to go out to kill something, point me towards activities I can do and where they are instead. A skippable newbie friendly area where you get introduced to the elements of gameplay would have done wonders instead of pages and pages of text.I just don’t want to risk an additional 1.5 hours knowing I already don’t like what I am seeing. I would suggest playing Sub-level Zero instead even though it is a rouge-like as the combat is done much much better.What as Shame."

Literally no explanation of game mechanics or systems - kill an enemy and pick up random orbs that do things because reasons.  Also enemies are super bullet-spongy.  I don't mind a grind if there's a concrete reward, or if the game takes time to explain, you know, what that reward actually is.  This game doesn't do that.  Objectives are super vague - go to this map marker and, well, that's it, really.  Controls are very twitchy - it literally feels like your ship is coated in bacon grease.  I played all 3 Descent games back in the day, and this is nowhere near that level of quality.  It shows some promise, but right now it's not there yet."

This game was built in the Unity engine and while there is some crude settings for sticks/gamepad in game, the dev does not support the function AT ALL.  You'll manage to get a few of the axis's to work, then one or two will be FUBAR.http://www.neonxsz.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=228&p=1706The Dev says ""trying to play Neon with a Joystick is like trying to drive a car with a banana"". I say ""Trying to fly a 6DOF game with a mouse and keyboard is like trying to drive a car with your feet"".This game looked like a nice modern spin on Descent/Forsaken type games. Too bad it has such a lousy limitation on control devices."
