It reminds me alot of diablo (I think the background music in the town of Babatula is intentionally similar to the in-town music in diablo), but is a deeper game with its own unique style and character. There is a lot of loot and great variety of ways to build your character, Rick. I like the 2d, almost cartoonish character graphics and the art in general. This is some of the best turn-based hack and slash you can get for 5 bucks.I also bought this game on Xbox Live in 2012- btw, shame on xbox for their shoddy support for indie games - I owned my xbox 360 for 5 years before I even realized there were indie games available. Xbox does nothing to promote indie games despite the large number of quality games, frequently available for just a dollar."

That said, I am still enjoying it for what it is.  If your in the mood for something light, give this a try."
76561198028253012,Recommended,296050,13076786,"Posted: 25 November, 2014",all,Ghin,"The trailer for this game is exactly what you get, so if you enjoyed it, you will enjoy this game. It is a combat-based action RPG in the style of an older Diablo game with a focus on straightforwardness, simplicity, and an absurd, lovable, and cartoonish style. The main character, Rick, is a melee fighter that you can augment by choosing different stats and items to wear.Like Diablo, the fun of the game is in beating things up and finding items.  Rick accomplishes both of these by slamming his knife into enemies until they die in Rogue-like fashion. The strategy comes how you plan ahead by choosing what to wear, what to carry, where to stand, etc. rather than the actual combat, which is mostly just your stats comparing with the monsters and deciding how to use your consumable items. You also have a special meter that can be used to give yourself a boost for a short time. It's easy to understand and enjoyable.Once you finish the game, you can try again with a different character and a stat focus. There are 9 or 10 special abilities you can pick as you level, some of which are passive. You can have up to 4, but some of them won't be relevant for the way you're playing. For example, I wouldn't choose a power like Flash (which uses your special meter to teleport you) on a character focused on Strength and Speed because I would never have enough Willpower to use it consistently. Or similiarly, I wouldn't choose Eagle Eye (which raises your attack rating and critical hit rate) on a character with a high Dexterity because I would already be hitting everything accurately and it would be redundant. You can choose a special ability to focus on one path, use in an emergency, or to balance out a weakness. There are enough different combinations and achievements to play through the game several times if you want.If the store page appeals to you and you're looking for a light, enjoyable game, I recommend this. It's exactly what it looks like and it has enough depth for me to enjoy 90+ hours."

It's a pretty interestingly deep strategy RPG style game, with a large ingame world, and a great art style, it's got a pretty nice price for all the content you get.

Which means you can't rebind the awful keyboard layout (you actually have to use Esc for more than just bringing up the game menu!) and you can't adjust any audio setting besides turning off the music.For a rogue lite, it has a shockingly low challenge level.  The death penalty (yeah, you can come back to life!) just subtracts a small amount of experience and gold and sets you at the entrance to the map you were on, leaving all the monsters in their current state.It ends up just being really boring and annoying to play.  Buy when it's 80-90% off if you're curious, otherwise stay away.  Go play Dungeons of Dredmor instead."

This is the perfect game to play for just those times."
,Recommended,296050,32944041,Posted: 28 June,all,Paco Vodka,"I bought this game for a whole $0.79 because I was poor and bored. I have played 42 hours of this game according to steam and to be honest I think that is low balling it. I'm not sure what kind of poor-college-student-inducing sorcery hoodoo was used to birth this game, but it is worth every, literal penny—all 79 of them.This game rewards exploring and checking all your corners. The first few run throughs can be tough, especially if you're trying to conquer hard-core. This is because you can never really be sure what you're about to get into sometimes until you're right in the middle of it. Sometimes it's strangely colored echolocating bats, or weird lumpy genie woman things, or your good ol' run of the mill goblin.The gear is pretty awesome when you get something new and fairly over powered early on. I do wish that the player character would reflect the changing gear.Overalll, I would recommend this game to whoever had the time, patience, and cheetos to listen me gush on end about this game. A conversations which usually goes:""Hey, what did you think of this game?""""I got it for 79 cents and I played it for 42 hours.""""Huh, sounds like a good deal.""""Yup."". . . or something like that."
,Not Recommended,296050,12089047,"Posted: 13 September, 2014",all,DaReputableJesus,BATTLEPATHS is a turnbased RPG that claims to be a roguelike. It has the traditional roguelike gameplay but nothing besides the loot drops is randomised. The game looks promising but falls flat at the gameplay. It has the turnbased movement but that doesn't exclude the randomised gamplay. The combat is really bland. You have 4 spells. Only 4 spells! Most turnbased roguelikes have over 50 spells and those 50 spells have more variety than a big bag of jellybeans. I often find myself hammering one button over and over again to kill a monster. 60% of the time I get to kill the monter. It just feels boring. The game claims to have variety in the loot drops but there is none. I found the same armor 5000 times and the same weapon 5000 times. Battlepaths said that it would let you build your own individual character. If you think this game had classes or something that would change your playstyle you're wrong. There is none of this♥♥♥♥♥♥ I went into this game hoping for an awesome rogulike experience but I got a poorly made bland turnbased RPG that couldn't make me smile once.STAY AWAY FROM THIS TITLE

Oh and the loot is always armor, boots, helmet, amulet or one handed melee weapon, that's it, you don't even have shields in this game.""addictive 2D-RPG""It was playable for 2-3 hours at most, but that's becouse I haven't played any simple RPGs(which I love) in a while. It can hardly be called even a simple RPG as there is only warrior class, you can't even rename your hero(he's always called Ralph or something, it's probably dev's name) and you don't have any skills(aside from ""specials"" that you activate to get+movement speed for few turns for example, which would do but you can have 4 max and I only had 2 on the level 17).""excellent loot system""Basicly anything that rolled without +damage is nearly useless, most of what you'll find is complete trash.""The battle begins in Babatula, the first of three big realms to explore.""It's tiny, especially non-story dungeons, they are like one room, i'm not kidding, you enter something called the viper cave and it's just one room. And those bigger dungeons are annoying to explore becouse there is no map.""You can choose to play in different realms that each have their own landscape and their own set of creatures""The most boring, typical fantasy landscapes you'll ever see in your life and reskins of the same of creatures - mages, archers(basicly mages but without resists), strong melee fighters, quick melee fighters and weak enemies that can't do♥♥♥♥♥♥to you. That's basicly it.""The character customization allows you to create a unique hero with its own strengths and weaknesses. You can build a heavy, damage dealing tank, a deadly ninja that utilizes high speed and agility to attack his victims from out of nowhere, a true master of mind who crushes his foes with powerful combinations of special abilities, or something in between. ""Regardless of your ""build"" all you'll ever do is press attack to whack enemy with your melee weapon, and sometimes use healing potions on yourself and throw damage/sleep potion, maybe throw a summon potion so that enemies can unfocus you for one turn. That's it, there are no potions of poison, weakness(even though there is poison and weakness status effects in the game) or anything, at least not in the first and second realms that i've played, all the atack/summon/heal potions were the same♥♥♥♥♥♥as in the very beginning but stronger.Only your character has movement and attack animation, overall this games looks like an amatuer tileset for  a roguelike while having zero content in comparison.This is a game that should've been free, devs are still bugfixing it, but should've just abandoned it long ago and focus on making something better."

Sure, this game becomes tedious trying to 100%, and the character graphics stay the same as you change your armor (slight graphic changes as you Level Up), but for the price, I think this game is great. It's all about upgrading and leveling up in order to progress and complete the game. This game has great controller support, decent top view graphics and a nice upgrade system. There are 3 Realms to fight through with different enemies in each, and a Hall of Challenges Mode. I'll give this game a good 7 out of 10, for the fact it plays well, has a lot of items, and a good difficulty level.It does get repetitive however trying to complete the Achievements. The Realms only take about 10 hours to complete, and another 20 for the other Achievements, and then much longer if you get into the Hardcore Achievements. Still recommend this for anyone with a gamepad, looking for Achievements & Cards and just something new for their Library."

,Not Recommended,296050,18814468,"Posted: 1 November, 2015",all,ViciousRaptor,"Battlepaths is a roguelike dungeon crawler with a fantasy theme. You move around by using the arrow keys and you attack by 'walking' into enemies. There's an inventory screen, you can compare items and you can add magical abilities to items by finding the right type of loots. Special abilities can be activated by pressing tab. It looks a bit like Diablo but it plays like Dungeons of Dredmore.Unfortunately, it is also rather boring. I played on hardcore mode, died and then realised that because the map isn't randomised (only the loot is) I would have to do the exact same thing over and over. ""Hardcore"" mode is only fun when every challenge is different. I don't play ""normal"" mode when there's a hardcore mode available as I don't think dying and losing some experience in this game would in any way provide for a meaningful gaming experience. It'd just be a slow, boring and ugly grind while experiencing something that doesn't move me at all.I also gathered that you can obtain a game key for free, which makes every cent spent on it seem a poor investment.That being said: the game is solid. It does what it is supposed to but it just isn't a lot of fun."
