76561198059383232,Not Recommended,296150,10291000,"Posted: 30 May, 2014",all,Burnout,"Let's start at the beginning. When the buggy menu FINALLY lets you join a game (that is, if there are any available), you are dropped into what seems to be a waiting area where you can run around randomly. Then you click the join arena button, where it sends you into the g-ball arena, which is a giant sphere full of random things on the ground and floating rings in the air. That's it. No explanation, no tutorial, nothing. It seems they just expect you to automatically know what to do.Now, the controls. First, you can't change them in game. Second, the standard setup isn't too bad, but it's unresponsive and hard to figure out. For example, why the hell is the button to throw a ball the right click? To move the camera, you have to hold either mouse button and drag, however it too is unresponsive.Overall, I think this game really does have potential. The graphics and environments are nice, but everything else needs work. Also, it REALLY needs an instruction guide."

I like the idea of a sport in zero gravity.  Where this falls down is in the execution.  It is glitchy, the physics sometimes defy logic, and of course the result is a multiplayer game with NO player base.  It's dead.  I begged my gf and she played with me to get the achievements, but in hindsight the only fun was not the game but in making fun of it.  Like watching a really bad movie.  It's so bad it is funny.  If I played this with random players (if there were any) then maybe it would be less fun.Avoid this game like the plague.  Shame on the authors for tarnishing NASA and shame on NASA for not suing them over it.0.1/10 at 33c-100/10 at $3.99"

,Not Recommended,296150,10303810,"Posted: 31 May, 2014",all,MrRodgers117,"Where do I even begin to explain this game.Okay, it starts like this. You spawn, you jump and try to get the red ball. Only thing is, you cant, because you miss it by an inch EVERY TIME. Then when omeone has the ball there is no way to get it from them unless you go back to one of the goals and get a thunderball. You miss, then you miss again, and finally after countless tries you score.Now the controls are amazingly crappy. I can barely control my guy. Its hard af to turn around, and if i get on one of the jump pads below the goals it always knocks me right into them. After knocking into it, I slowly at about .2m/s facing it like im stupid. The game would make a really good lets play, because just about everything that happens makes you want to knock the screen in. The only enjoyable part about it is the taunts, because you can dance thriller and gangam style. Also why is this called astronaut academy if your playing a space sport? Really glad I got this free from astronaut rescue.1/10. Only because I got it for free and the taunts are funny. Can be good with work."

Aside from the fact that it's a glitchy mess, obvious from the moment you launch it, there doesn't seem to be another human soul online to play it with. And you can't play against the computer. So if you love running around in an empty and glitch ridden futuristic sporting arena, go for it."

I didnt play it much. The concept is not bad, your part of a team of zeroG footballers the idea seeming to be to pick up one of a couple of ball types and either score or attack a player with. As simple as the game is, it's controles are what REALLY let it down. your mouse only controles looking about as far as i can tell, while w and s control forward and backwards, a and d are turn left and right, but there is a turning circle meaning you turn more like your driving a forklift truck rather than a person, there is strafe but its unresponsive and slow.This game needs some serious changes to be any good imo, the main one being the movement, its all just too slow, you cant quick dodge or side step and once airborn you never now whats gunna happen, you could go all the way to the other side of the sphere you play in, or you could just shoot off on  random axis for no given reason.The graphics of the game are aso a little odd, the terrain looks decent though dated but the characters are glossy as hell, like they are wearing super shine spandex and the ""audience"" is a VERY bad bitmap.All in all, I dont think this game is a bust, NASA need to really think about what ppl want in a game rather than trying to be inavitive, they just dont have the experiance for it. Do a co-op space survival game, DayZ on the moon kind of thing. Its not unique, but it would sell.Gameplay 3/10Audio 5/10Graphics 4/10Overall Rating 3/10This Game wasn't even worth the money at free, what little time I didn spend on it was just not enjoyable at all."

It is worse than the other Starlite Astronaut game, which I actually didn't think was possible.  The online multiplayer is dead, the controls are terrible, the game is not fun at all.  This game is everything you never wanted in a multiplayer game.  Buying an 8-ball would be a better life choice than buying g-ball."

Some feedback on this game would include an easier-to-understand system for newer players who do not research much about the game--After about 10 minutes of trying to figure out how to play, I had to download a PDF from google to understand the rules. There is a tutorial map, but for whatever reason I was not able to create a game with a tutorial."

Nobody playing multiplayer. Game is as dead as it gets.If you're an achievement hunter, this one is pretty easy to 100% with 2-3 hours grind. If you're not, there isliterallyno excuse for picking this up. Avoid at all costs, or pick up on sale at <£1 if you must."

,Not Recommended,296150,11928809,"Posted: 30 August, 2014",all,kazereal,"Bad controls of movement and camera are enough to cause nausea.Character moves like a giraffe in zero-g which isn't exactly sporty.Then there are bunch of nonsensical rules which seem to be to make sports fans feel at home or something..My suggestion: remove all distracting floating things, don't try to make it like ""quidditch in space"".Seems like original idea was about zero-g basketball so make it that: just two goals, a ball and two teams.That's it.Now it is just a waste of time as a game, as an experiment and as a simulation since it is entirely hypothetical in nature.If people are going to be playing games in space for excercise it should be kept simple."
