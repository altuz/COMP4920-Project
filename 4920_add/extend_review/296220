Gameplay is nothing new, you click on stuff so you can click on more stuff, then click on something else. The time management portion is iffy. I never really felt stressed out about the time limits and some of the earlier levels are much harder than the later ones. Once you figure out the basic ""engine"" and how to build it with your starting material on every level, it can feel like more of a chore then the other farm frenzy games. If, like me, you like winding down with casual cow clicking, pick this up on sale. Laugh at the awful translation and take it for what it is - shovelware of the highest degree. That said, it takes about 25 hours to complete (gold star on all levels), so it's actually pretty good value.The Farm Frenzy Franchise (ooo alliteration!) doesn't really set a lofty standard of gameplay, but this one fails completely. I won't be buying others in the series after this."

Each mission is timed (1 to 2 minutes), giving you little time to look around. Tasks just involves clicking in a series of areas to produce a certain final product. Bonus items also requires that you look around the scene and find it. Obstacles (like moles) try to impede your progress. The only way to get rid of them is, you guessed it, click on it.I was looking for a sandbox mode but can't find the option. I originally hoped this game would be some sort of cartoony sim farm, but all missions are timed leaving you little time to actually enjoy the game.Wouldn't recommend this game."

Or it gives the impression it's been poorly translated because of its terrible grammar and nonsensical dialogue. I'd hate to think who wrote the text actually spoke English.The game itself is mostly functional, but there are similar games out there with better production value.  If you liked the ones that came before it, and don't bother reading anything, you might enjoy it, as it adds a couple of new mechanics in, but I was left feeling pretty disappointed."

I'm not sure if anyone else experienced this, but whenever I would plug in or unplug my laptop cord, the game would freeze and crash. This would also happen if I used alt+tab too many times (the amount changed depending on... some factor that I'm unaware of?), or it I unplugged my headphones too many times.Still, this is a fun, mindless game that I've replayed a few times. I enjoyed it and I still find it's worth the money I spent on it."
76561198030321347,Not Recommended,296220,29476082,Posted: 24 January,all,Pyewacket,"This is NOT a farming game.  It is, in fact, a factory game, the use of farm products as widgets notwithstanding.If that's fine with you, then great.  Personally I want a FARMING game - without the ""social"" junk imposed by Farmville.There is no continuity in this game whatsoever.  You are not building a farm, you are not planting crops, you are not able to choose for yourself which farm buildings you want or where they will be placed.It's a series of hoops you have to jump through with a set goal, imposed by the game, and totally linear.  The only thing that is valued is how fast you can do things.  They place the buildings at random so at each new ""level"", none of which last more than a few minutes, you are starting over with some random initial conditions.  Within each level, the initial settings will be the same, but from one level to the next, you are starting with different buildings placed in varying and seemingly random locations, and with a variable number of farm animals and varying amounts of startup cash.You are never building on what's gone before.  Doesn't matter if you bought a sausage factory in the last 28 levels, you'll have to buy it again the next level.There is zero replay value.  Once you've hit the end, you've hit the end - and each new ""challenge"" is the same as the last.  Do things FAST and count on starting from scratch at the next level.I wish somebody out there would make an actual farming game that does not rely on - or even PERMIT - access to social media.If you're looking for an actual farming game, this is NOT it.Also there are a ton of small but very annoying bugs in the game.  Firstly, in order to get it to run at all, I had to go and disable Tablet PC Input Service, even though it was set for Manual only startup.  I have no idea why; I have never started that service ever, as I would have to specifically do when a service is set for Manual.  But nothing would satisfy the stupid game except that it be actually disabled.  That's just bad programming on the game developer's part.Then, everytime it starts up, it is screwing up the configuration check and tells me that my PC ""does not meet the minimum requirement"" - when in fact it exceeds them.  I can run Dragon Age and The Elder Scrolls Oblivion on here - heck, I can run all of the Witcher series on this but The Witcher 3, which is the most advanced game I own and needs way more graphics power than I have on this system.  But apparently not Farm Frenzy 4, even though this machine exceeds the listed system requirements.Then, it will lock up once in a while for no apparent reason.  If you have too many animals, you have to watch how much grass you put out - because if you put down too much grass, the pigs will go to sleep as if there were no grass at all out.  The music on startup will sound like a stuck record, playing the same 2 or 3 notes over and over and over again while its loading the startup screen.And the English translations are among the worst I've ever been forced to deal with.  You would think they could find one person in Japan or whereever this game comes from who can actually speak English to do their translations, or at least check the translations.  It's not QUITE of ""all your base are belong to us"" quality, but its close.If you would be happy with a game called ""Factory Frenzy"" then this game may be for you.But if you want an actual farming game, this isn't it."

,Recommended,296220,17938519,"Posted: 7 September, 2015",all,matt30060,"I have never played any of the prior Farm Frenzy games except the demos. FF4 is a surprisingly addictive game. I am used to buying and playing high-budget AAA games and playing a ""casual"" game like FF4 is a different experience for me.I was introduced to ""time-management"" games recently and I am enjoying this genre because it requires a bit of fast-paced thinking, not just clicking.  FF4 can get a little hectic and it takes a while to get through the entire campaign. It is very difficult to collect all the Steam Achievements due to how many rounds there are in the entire campaign.As many reviewers have noted, the broken English in the game used is pretty bad. It is a bit distracting if you are trying to immerse yourself in this game.  How hard can it be to find one American editor to clean up the broken English?The sound effects are good and functional. The cartoony graphics works for this game.  Again, my biggest criticism is the poor English being used. I am not a grammar Nazi, I simply object to what appears to be laziness on the developer's part to find someone who knows conversational English to edit the text.Aside from that quibble, I have no regrets getting FF4. As usual, I wait for a 66%-75% sale before I buy as to minimize the risk of paying money for a bad game. Yes, I know Steam does refunds but with all the games I have and available today, I am simply not into paying full retail price for most games.FF4 is a cute but challenging time-management/strategy game.  Don't let the cutesy graphics fool you. It does require some strategy to get through to the very end. I highly recommend FF4.UPDATE: I still prefer FF4. It is still the best version of the FF. I tried the sequels after FF4 and I really disliked the style and the mini-games. I was greatly disappointed in them which reinforces my love of FF4."

They were great to start out with, fun cartoony graphics, fast-paced play and challenging levels.  Then they got really hard but still enjoyable (All the FF3 varients). Then came the latest ones, FF:Hurricane Season and their ilk - really a blast to play and not too hard but still a bit of a challenge.With FF4 I don't know what the heck happened!  The graphics are awful, the animals barely even move around, the machines are not upgradable, the cat meows incessantly and the game play is SLOOOOOOOW.  The story is disjointed and the main character looks nothing like the original character.   It's like the developers lost any ability to program the basic things they had been doing before.  Are they trying to make the animals more realistic?  Well they look unformed or something.  I sure wish they had left well enough alone.  Oh well, I am still going to play it and I guess I'll recommend it if you can get it really cheap (about $2 or so), but it's sad that the franchise has gone so far down hill."

It may be called Farm Frenzy but it isn't.A few highlights;-Controls feel sluggish.-Game seems to have been run through Google Translate from whatever language it was written to English, into Russian, and then back into English producing such lovely hints such as this: 'The combo multipler has several marks and a certain sum next to each mark that you get once you reach this or that mark. Let's try to reach the first mark!' This is some seriously advanced Engrish.-Adorable protag Scarlett has been replaced by scary uncanny valley dwellers.-Animals apparently don't die if you don't give them enough food, instead they go to sleep. Bears no longer fling animals out of the pen, instead they scare them into not producing.I'm incredibly salty that I'm outside the window for getting a refund on this train wreck.

Everything is done from one screen and is a simple game of cooldowns, grinding, and the occasional clicking on a random event.

It's got a lot going on, there's constant challenge, and quite a bit of variety in terms of produce and products. Unfortunately much of it is a bit too frenzied and it just isnt' quite as user friendly as it could be to really make it enjoyable. Much of the time the challenge comes from clicking as fast as you can to collect things or process things. Added frustration is also included by having a limited number of stations so they have to be converted to complete certain levels. It's not terrible, it just feels more like grind than fun to me."
