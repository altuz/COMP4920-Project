I couldn't stop playing until i was done with it :)Cons:- couldn't really play in window mode, because it would crash for me (only one crash in Fullscreen)- well, not really 24+ hours of gameplay. It took me 10 hours to play through and unlock all (ingame) achievements. the only thing i didn't do was complete all Pirate-levels with 5 Stars (because i'm not a big fan of Angry Bird-mechanics)Pros:- although the game crashed a couple of times, no progress was lost- 10 hours of simple fun (totally worth the money, even at full price)- 12 levels of an Angry Bird style Pirate game- addicting unlock system, where you want to procede into higher tiers and unlock more buildings- it starts of very simple and gets alot more complex as you have to handle alot more wares and workers, but it never felt overwhelming- time challenges (optional) where you have to do certain tasks or get a fixed amount of wares (reward is a small bonus and it counts towards an achievement, but you can take all the time you want to finish)What do you have to do in this game?It's all about handling your settlers. There are five different Professions which they will specialise in, depending on what you let them do more often. They will ofcourse work faster when they do a job which they are specialised in (but don't worry you can relearn them later on in the game).On top of that they have 3 Statusbars which will decrease over time and might slow down their workflow alot. There is- Hunger (will decrease over time while they work)- Companionship (will decrease depending if they like their job, are ok with it, or dislike it; to raise it they will interrupt their work and talk to another settler for a while)- Health (some jobs are marked as risky and they will cost life over time; they won't die but need to heal up from time to time at the hospital - which needs herbs, so just like with food you have to watch out that you have enough of it)The buildings are in fixed locations so you have to manage how many workers you declare per building or you need to drag and drop your settlers to fasten up their production rate.You also have to trade your wares for Gold so you can afford more Settlers and upgrades for your buildings.So if you like to build-up, manage economy / workflow and trade - this game is absolutely for you."

You train them to become workers or farmers and they’ll be faster and less easily tired.You’ll unlock all the parts of the map by accomplishing a series of tasks. You have to manage your resources either by picking it up on the map or by making it yourself. Food can be picked from bushes and trees or grown in your fields by your farmers. Trees can be cut for wood, stones and iron can be excavated by your workers. You’ll be making special building like forges to make building tools and whatnot, the usual drill..The graphics are very cute and detailed but it’s too bad that we can’t zoom back as the camera is really too close. You can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to quickly move around your map. You’ll trade merchandises using a boat, I got attacked by pirates and had to fight them in an Angry Birds mini game! It’s rather well done and fun. You'll unlock more levels of that mini game by building a fort.The game is very slow compared to other similar ones. Money required is pretty high and your way of making it pretty low so it will be a looooong grind. Expect to keep the game running on itself for hours. The popup messages about the trading prices will constantly pause the game, it’s annoying as they’re pretty common. I don’t understand why they haven’t chosen to let the game run when quit considering the low speed of production.The game also lacks personality: i.e. In The Happy Hereafter there’s a lot of humor, in Virtual Villagers there’s mysteries and surprises to discover. Those games craft charm and you do eventually get attached to your village. Here there’s nothing beyond the trading messages and the very empty texts of build this or that, point.TL:DR the game is nice but gets dull, only buy the game in a sale so you won’t regret it. Or buy another one!Similar games: The Happy Hereafter on Steam, All My Gods and Hero of the Kingdom games.. Outside Steam:  the Virtual Villagers games, Wild Tribe, The Island Castaway games, Gemini Lost, Farm Tribe, Wandering Willows."

But what do you know - while getting those drops I've actually started playing - and got so hooked it's not even funny!That game stands next to Artist Colony, My Tribe, Gemini Lost, Wandering Willows (well, sort of), and Virtual Villagers (sans starving and otherwise meeting their demise villagers). If you ever played any of that - you will feel right at home from the very start. And yes - I've played all of those (and more).Pluses: really nice appealing art, easy to learn, easy to master, there's no sensitive controls or time limits that you have to meet to progress further in game...Minuses: if you are looking for high-octane action - that game is not for you. If you don't like resource management - that game is not for you. If you don't have patience for micromanaging and otherwise keeping track and ordering around 50 ""loyal subjects"" - you probably will not like it much (but I might be wrong).Now if only they add Steam achievements to that... ;PP.S. It took me 15 hrs to beat from start to finish - no skipping puzzles, no guides or tutorials, but not getting high scores in mini-game either. As for replay value - idk, not much challenge here for me... but still might get back to it some day."

I was most put off by the poor English in store page and such, considering it seems to be a quasi-fantasy game roughly about the English settlement of North America.I was pleasantly surprised.  I started playing it, and I did not stop for 7 hours.  Even now, I only stopped playing because I started falling asleep in my chair.It's a slow-paced, easy-going town-builder in which you grow your ""colony"" from a single building and a few colonists into a bustling village, complete with trade, jobs, building upgrades, and scientific research.  I really appreciated that it never makes you feel anxious about staying on top of things, like the Anno series can sometimes do.  You totally set the pace in this game, so if you're looking for a relaxing play, this could be for you.I was surprised by the quality of the game.  While a few things are a bit off--like the way the colonists perform the exact same animation at the exact same time when they talk to one another--the game shows a lot of polish, overall.  I never felt like my enjoyment of the game was being damaged in any way by a lack of effort or expertise on the part of the game's designers and/or developers.It's a bit like a slimmed down and streamlined Sims meets Farmville meets Anno, without any stressful situations, pushy monetization, or excessive micromanagement.  Overall, I would recommend this game to fans of its genre, though I would not really know what to call it."
,Recommended,296240,11695963,"Posted: 13 August, 2014",all,Praxis-[CE],"The Promised Land is a ridiculously cute little time-management/city-builder that sucks you in and doesn't let go until you beat the game (which looks like it can be done in around 10-12 hrs). It's a really simple casual game but there's a lot going on and it's really enjoyable if you're looking for a relaxing experience that doesn't require a huge amount of concentration.The basic setup is similar to a lot of other games, gather resources, build things, make stuff, sell things, get gold, upgrade buildings, get more workers, etc. There is quite a nice variety of resources and manufactured goods, and a couple dozen buildings at least, each with its own series of upgrades.  There is also a research laboratory that allows you to study half a dozen separate advancements, and those unlock buildings and upgrades in your industries and elsewhere in your colony.The workers will specialize and become more efficient after doing a certain task for a while. I especially like that the workers themselves have preferences, and if you put them in a job they enjoy, they are more productive than if you assign them a task they dislike. I also really enjoy the way that you pick up your workers to move them to tasks, and that they totally react to you doing that.The housing has an interesting puzzle aspect to it. You can upgrade your houses to increase the number of workers you can have, but it requires manipulating rooms in a sort of jigsaw puzzle in order to maximize the number of colonists each building can hold.Finally, there is a mini-game simulating naval combat that basically is Angry Birds with cannons and pirates."

You gradually come to realize that what you thought was the tutorial is actually the entire game. There's only one map, and the game basically takes you step by step through it. You can't fail at anything, and there's no challenge. The entirety of the game you will spend simply waiting for more of a resource to collect so you can build something that will then require you to wait for more of a resource to collect. It's as if someone took the resource management part of Age of Empires and turned it into a game. The end result is there's nothing at all you can do with your resources. If there was a game speed increase, you could finish the entire game in 20 minutes.There's some lurking potential here if some mechanics for challenge were added. I kept hoping the ""game map"" was a shortened tutorial map that would later throw you into a series of more unforgiving islands. Perhaps the developers will later turn this into a full-fledged title with suitable strategy, but I cannot recommend the gameplay that's presented here."

It is on rails for the most part but it's a nicely designed, fairly slow paced simulation. Graphically appealing despite the lack of video options. I also noticed near the end that the music was still uplifting and not getting old like other game's musical scores do. The sound effects are mostly charming and minimal which helps when these sounds play over and over so many times.The player has the choice to micro-manage for quicker growth, or to sit back and let things happen. Your citizens will perform their assigned tasks without maintenance. The only real choices to make are what order to spend your research or tobuild your buildings in, switching output of specific industries (switching the metal worker between gold and silver output) and specific chores for the individual citizens. Buildings are built in pre-planned spaces, and you do not choose how many of each there will be; there will be only 1 iron mine, 1 kitchen etc. However, there are 3 farm plots that unlock as the game progresses and each is relegated to specific crops.Each citizen has a preffered task and a hated task. The citizen can do any chore you want, but will stay happy if doing their favorite job and lose happiness fast if they are doing their hated job. I also feel that they skill up faster if doing something they like or are trained to do. The only combat whatsoever takes place in an Angry Bird fashion, and can be replayed as much as you wish. So you won't permanently lose any battle. It's a refreshing change of pace actually.I've played through it once and I might try it again. The single playthrough was worth the money. I don't always finish games, even the ones I like, usually because they lose me along the way. This one kept me interested until the end. I didn't feel overwhelmed, and I didn't feel the need to micro-manage to the end. I also was equally comfortable letting it run as I went to the bathroom or got a drink; event result in a pop-up that pauses the game until you click on the screen.For the price, I do recommend this game. I've paid far more for worse."

There are tons of resources to gather, buildings to build and upgrade, and a good variety of areas to explore. You'll gradually manage more and more colonists with varying abilities as you explore the map and make the most of all the land has to offer, as you quest for the fabled Fountain of Happiness.What surprised me most about the game is an the addition of ""pirate battles,"" which really play more like rounds of Angry Birds. There are 12 of these stages, and they are satisfying and welcome diversions. I could have easily enjoyed many, many more of these battles, but really, the bulk of the game is spent building your colony through gathering and trade.The Promised Land is a much better game that you might think it would be.

There's a mini-game, Angry Birds style, where you ""fight"" pirates. Not much going on there, the new games are few and far between. My ship was attacked by pirates once at the beginning so I was almost looking forward to that- the risk, the danger! But then later I realized how long it would take to recoup resources I was horrified at the idea.I would *maybe* recommend it to people with young children or perhaps chronic multi-taskers who are in the process of reading a book of some kind. The play is SO unbelievably, painfully, slow. Wait wait wait until you build up enough whatevers. The people move slowly, you can't speed them  up, you can't zoom out to look at large areas. I have gotten 28 villagers and it seems like it took forever. One thing that really irritates me is that it automatically pauses when you alt+tab to try to kill time on social media or something.On top of that, random talk bubbles come up that essentially pause the game until you respond so you can't just let it go while you go make dinner or something. The prompts are constantly coming up to sell something and putting everything you have into that resource to sell larger quantities is time and resource consuming.Fishing is way too slow (even by this game's standards).

Small map, made even smaller by the locked zoom level. Your view of your colony is very small, and you wind up spending most of your time clicking around the minimap or scrolling the viewfinder.Like most Facebook games, Promised Land becomes a waiting game the farther in you get. Whether you're waiting for research, a particular set of goods, or just the trade ship to return, you will wind up with numerous periods of nothing to do.  Normally this wouldn't be a problem, however, when you're just sitting their waiting, you can't click out of the game! This is a MAJOR oversight! If you're going to make players wait on your game speed, do not force them to just watch the game itself. Clicking anywhere outside the game automatically pauses it.Also, the resolution is locked, and can only be toggled between full screen and windowed. Many people on the forums have complained about the full screen resolution, a problem I also experienced.The gameplay itself is fun, but until the other issues are fixed, I would not recommend."

,Recommended,296240,22055510,"Posted: 25 March, 2016",all,AbbydonPrime,"This was an interesting worker management game. Unlike many of the others that involve simply assigning people, collecting resources, and then building, this one has some additional unique features. Most notably, the workers have job likes and dislikes, and they can become skilled in a particular type of trade, such as farmer or miner. They will level up, and become more productive, the longer they do a certain type of task. They can also be sent to school to skill up.To gain money, resources and products can be traded with the mainland via the ship. New workers are also hired from the mainland this way. Specialty items have to be purchased from the mainland. Every now and then, a certain type of item will become more in demand and be worth more. This is when you assign as many workers as possible to collect and/or manufacture to fill the demand. As the game progresses, workers, specialty items, upgrades, etc, will get more expensive, so taking advantage of the demand spike helps raise money faster.As part of the story, there are pirates to be dealt with. This is done by firing a cannonball at their ""boat"" structures. There are a limited number of balls, so they have to be aimed just right in order to cause an optimal toppling to take out multiple pirates. There are a few of these to deal with during the quest, and the final ones can get a little annoying. But, you can retry as much as needed.There isn't any way to die and resources are infinite, so it really is a casual game. As with most Alawar games, it is very aesthetically pleasing with appropriate music and sound effects. I don't think it's worth $6.99 due to the relatively short play time and no real replayability, but it's worth picking up on sale if you just want to relax and not stress about losing.---For more...My Reviews||My casual gaming...Group|Curator Page"

Unlike a lot of city building games this won't frustate you with revolts(after carefully trying to keep everyone happy)  and watching your community burn while you try to figure out what has suddenly gone wrong.

I know I'm not the only one since I checked the forum and there's also a few negative reviews that mention it not running.I don't know what's happened to it in the 2 years since I left my initial review but it seems to be a bit broken now :( Hopefully they can fix it, but keep in mind in the meantime that it may not work for you.This game plays like it wants to be an interactive screensaver, yet I have to admit I really enjoy playing around with it.It's very nicely laid out and very simple to play, you can wander away and leave them to it and not be in danger of any catastrophe occurring.The little peeps have a nice personal touch to them which I like, they all have their own likes and dislikes. I'd like to have seen something done with the 'social' aspect like this, something that fits the tone of the game like logging a best friend for them perhaps based on who they chat to the most, but even a randomly selected one would have been nice, just to add another little personal touch to them.I like to try and make it slightly more challenging by tailoring my colony to the likes and dislikes of each inhabitant, it's not at all challenging but I try lol.This is one of those weird games that is a complete waste of time and yet you don't seem to mind at all.The negatives for me:The pirate mini game. I didn't mind it at first but the longer I play the main game, the less I feel it fits.The people are quite varied in looks and mixed with the likes and dislikes they do feel unique and then there comes a point when you're adding colonists and they start becoming clones of ones you already have and if they have the same job type then they're also wearing the same clothing, and the uniqueness they had is gone *boo hoo*. I don't know if I've just been unlucky with the random choice available via the boat, but I feel if they'd had something very simple like a mix of hair colors for each character type that feeling of uniqueness could have been maintained for much longer."

It made me quite grateful for having the opportunity to see the sun rise many mornings in a row, disallowing myself the chance to sleep in pusuit of pirate golds and aztec treasures, all while becoming immersed in the need to maintain the health, happiness and full tummy's of my randomly gathered colonists.I am still playing, and the aztec gold still alludes me, but i am definately nearing my final goals, i can sense it!The waypointing is great in this game, the A.I. is wonderful, and if you like to be occupied for hours at a time this game is definately for you. Alot of micro-management, and enough time in-between everything to keep planning out your necessities. The map and the expansion process are quite static, but with the way it was put together its like a little story adventure and they could make literally millions of maps for this game, and i think they should :) The save system is great, as you always just pick up where you left off without even having to click save, even after a power outage or three ..... :(Oh and there is even small splashes of a mini-game that i wont spoil for you.Altogether i really feel it is a solid title with solid programming, and i have enjoyed it thoroughly.

Wasn't expecting too much at the beginning, seemed (That's SEEMED) simple and didn't think I was gonna last long. 8+ hours later in one sitting I was barely halfway through the building process. This game is certainly worth the time and turned out to be great fun. Only problem I had was the irritating popups of do this or do that or this price has fallen or this price is ghigher let's go trade now!...would have been much better served in a message window, not a popup that halted the game. I found the seemingly continuous side challenges a bit much as well as they interfered with what I was TRYING TO GET DONE...lol Which I guess shows the game is certainly engaging when you do NOT want to be interrupted in your current plans and actions.All in all it's a pretty nice and surprising little game. Pro-Tips..when you build houses check inside them, there is a maze picture puzzle that allows you to pretty much double the amount of citizens that house will hold. Try to keep your citizens assigned to whatever you started them as, worker, farmer...ect. If they're a woodcutter leave them doing it, artisan at the forge, don't move them. They get better and faster with each star. Likewise there's even more depth in the personality of each citizen, what they enjoy doing, what they hate..which I suppose effects their ""time to each level"" rate? Don't know, but those 2 tips helped me a lot. I look forwardto finally making the higher level goods...though I suppose it will be another 10 hour session to get there..lol.So, give it shot, not a bad game at all and NOT the toony clicker it appears at first."

Since The Promised Land has no microtransactions, it never deliberately inflicts you with the pain associated with the more well known fare. Your workers take time to perform their tasks but they usually finish up by the time you've checked your other spinning plates and come back. The game also throws in a poor man's Angry Birds style mini-game to handle your naval engagements. They're not bad, per se, just bland.Pros:- Everything, including the gameplay, is totally solid and stable.- The game ends at that perfect moment where it's still enjoyable but it's started to go stale.- Excellent controls and UI. It never gets in the way.Cons:- A hint or reminder system would be welcome. Do I train someone to be a worker or a farmer before sending them to collect silk? On that note ""Worker"" could be better named.- A few more character models would've been welcome. The game's population maxes out at 50, but that 50 is composed of like 6 character models?

The colonist models are fairly diverse, and only repeated 2-3 times each among 50 colonists. The gameplay is easy enough to grasp, but has a certain pace to it that kept it interesting - despite a few instances of waiting for enough resources to tick in.The game, however, is also very liniar in the sense that your progression in the game comes from completing a number of quests. These quests do allow some level of ""free"" development through research, but ultimately limits the type of resources you can get, what buildings you can build and so on to the progress of the questline.The buildings are limited to fixed, preset locations, so the freedom to make your colony as you want is more or less non-existentThe 7,3 hours of gameplay I've had is a complete run with every challenge and in-game acheivement on the highest level.All in all I found the game enjoyable to play through, but with little to no replay value. It's probably well suited for people unfamiliar with city-building or management games as a first peak into the genre."

I found it to be a relaxing, easy paced game that still had some challenge to it.  It did not make my head hurt trying to beat everything, it was just an enjoyable, relaxing time filler with decent graphics.I liked that I could keep defeating the pirates until I got 5 stars (Angry Birds scenario).  I have to say that I did not consider the pirates set up a natural segway with the flow of the type of game I was playing, but it was not bad, just a different flow.the only really negative point for me is that once you miss a timed event, you don't get a second chance to make it.  So, I received all gold awards except for completing timed events, it was silver with 13/15 done.  I had not known there were limited timed events or I would have spent more time on them.  I had assumed I would get more as the game moved on, but once you finish the challenges, there is nothing more to do, or build, or design, or create.  You can amass money, research points and all the products, but that is just sitting around watching it do its thing.  Just having the continued challenges would make the game a bit more replayable, or at least longer game play.As for the negative reviews, the only one I could agree with is that you can't zoom out (I kept trying, though!) but I got used to it.  I did get the flashy issue one time that one person compained about.  All i did was close out and restart the game and it disappeared.  Another negative review said it was fun the first time.  I agree, it was fun the first time, but it is not the kind of game you would really play a second time as there are not different strategies you can employ.I completed the game in the 20 hours listed.

Ever try to force your way through a few dumb episodes in series you're watching and need something to do on the other half of your monitor?  Look no further!  Does grandma call you and tell you about her virtual farm?  At least change the topic with this game.This is a basic resource management game, with no way to fail or die.  You might beat this game in 7 or 8 hours if you really played with optimum efficiency.  On the other hand, were I to train my dog to touch a mouse, he'd probably beat it in his lifetime, too.  The only way to fail is in your own mind, when you realize how inefficient you've been.  It's a casual game, but I nonetheless found it strangely compelling, and even rewarding.You start the game by managing a handful of settlers on an island.  You click a villager and drag him or her on top of a food source.  Poof!  That villager now gathers food.  You do this to other villagers to gather wood and stone.  You slowly gather resources and build (a pre-located) farm.  You manage the farm the same way.  Slowly, you build up a small town.As you grow over this small island, things get a little more complex.  Each settler has a job like and dislike, as well as three basic stats - hunger, social, and injury.  But their stats don't harm them, just make them limp slowly towards a refill station.  If you can match a settler to a job s/he likes, then her/his stats will decrease at a much lower rate than someone who hate's their job.This becomes important in the later game when you might have a bunch of jobs all lined up to create an industry.  For example: one guy cuts sugar cane, the next makes sugar, and a the next drops it off at a kitchen.   Meanwhile, someone grows corn, carries it to a mill and makes flour.  Those two ingredients make a special food.  That's probably the most complex industrial structure in the game - and there is a long lead into learning it.What makes the game compelling?First and foremost, it is cheap; often less than 2 bucks during any Steam sale.Secondly, it is a simple game, but rewards the player with little upgrades often enough to keep the momentum.Thridly, it is bright and colorful, and the settlers have cute little graphics, like an exaggerated 'thumbs up' they use when you help them out (via click and drag) or are placed in a happy job, among others.  And I often get connected to individual settlers unlike other games.  Ex:  I'm likely to remember that Marie likes mining and feel bad when I force her to do something she hates just to keep the colony moving.Fourthly, you can play the game windowed (on Win 10), at a low resolution.  Of course, the game is stuck in widescreen, but you should be able to play the game while having a small video screen up and running on a small part of your screen.Summary:  This is a cute, colorful, but simplistic casual game that involves (pre-planned) city-building with human and resource management.  It's very casual, with no way of death.  It's not hard at all, but it is rewarding.  It can eat away hours for a splt-screener, a grandparent, or someone like me, unemployed."

While I don't exactly regret it, this wasn't a very well thought out sim. You couldn't let it idle, because it would pause every time you left the game. You couldn't zoom out, which made it much more annoying to see what people were doing. It was also difficult to manage lager numbers of little villagers because they were always scurrying around, and while the game encourages micromanaging that becomes just about impossible late game. (The villager tab does help this a lot, but it's still too hard to keep track of people.) Additionally, it isn't rigorous about unlocking quests -- at one point it unlocked a timed mission for me to harvest a crop I hadn't yet unlocked, which seemed like an oversight (especially when it unlocks with a character asking for the crop because they're so impressed by the ones they've seen)."

There is no replay value at all.  I started over to see if it plays any differently.  The only difference is the settlers coming over on the boat have apparently random likes and dislikes, which calls for a bit of strategy in assigning them to jobs, taking into account that putting them on a job they dislike really destroys their efficiency.  The tasks sometimes have time limits which vary from easy to impossible to complete on time, but there is no real way to fail the tasks.  Research is so slow that choosing the wrong sequence to learn can easily cost an hour.  Tasks include upgrading the ship to carry more cargo, but it gives no real benefit since I eventually figured on selling only the requested goods, since you have to maximize the profit because the game takes forever anyway.

When I eventually installed it without re-reading its description, I was expecting a typical time/resource management like the rest in the bundle.What a pleasant surprise it was to find that it was a city builder, as I love those! Granted, it's not a city but a colony, but the game has more depth than what I expected. Every inhabitant has a preferred task and a task she/he hates, and it's quite fun to concile ""personal"" preferences with the resources you need to progress. The first moments spent working in a task ""locks"" the inhabitant into that role (up until you build the school, that is) so you might want to keep that little one away from an undesired profession until he/she gains his/her first star (after that, she/he will just be bad at doing things not from her/his profession). Personally I think one Builder and 2 Scientists are enough for the entire game.There are a few timed quests, but they're extremely easy to do without re-allocating too many people. The rest you can take as much time as you need to complete. And there's the pirates mini-game (basically Angry Birds with pirates), which I didn't enjoy as much as the main game.But the main game, well... I enjoyed it so much, that as soon as I beat it I started a new game.

There is literally no outside threat that could ruin the settlement, at worst it just means you grow slow if you somehow mismanage things - taking longer to progress overall.The enviroment operates very much like the old villager gathering/building akin to Age of Empires in the simulation and village-building from a single town center to a larger near-city size. But not quite, your population will remain modest, at most keeping under 50 total at its largest if I guess the buildings right. The enviroment is small, and the overal scope isn't grand, but its a good timewaster.There is a minigame sidequest that is very much akin to Angry Birds for both distractions and a first-time big resource boost and repeatable minor rewards.The game has a remarkable feel to it. Not quite stellar, but nearly nothing negative on how it works. It is polished, simple, and very focused on its little quest play you go through. I admit its tone is more geared for younger players, but all ages can still find it enjoyable to go through at whatver pace they feel comfortable with.Its something worth looking at, and nearly a must get on a good sale for the price - especially with what you could get out of it."
