If this was on 50% sale, then maybe.- The character movement is ridiculously slow due to the bad pathfinding, so you'll have to use WASD instead of mouse clicking- Harvesting resources with space key is slower in comparison to clicking them- House sizes are limited, why can't we have freedom to choose the sizes?- You have to restart the game to change settings- There is no volume setting, so you'll have to just tone down your volume from windows- There is no save game button, so if your game crashes, you're screwed2/10. I don't like it."

Above that, the crafting system isn't exactly user friendly. The NPC workers are bugged, and I often spend my hard earned money to hire a worker who just stands in the street doing nothing. There's also no save game option. Couple that with the occasional game crash, and you have an evening full of frustration.The town building is kind of cool. I haven't delved into the more advanced crafting recipes yet, so I can't speak for that aspect of the game. The farming does feel a bit like Farmville, and I can definitely see the parallels that other reviewers have drawn to this being a ""Facebook"" game.Here's what I would like to see for improvements to the game.-Faster walking/Better pathing-More user-friendly crafting interface-Fixed NPC bugs-NPCs with some personality (they're drone like at the moment)-Sandbox mode-Save game featureIf/When these features are added, I will definitely update this review and recommend this game. Until then, I wouldn't recommend it unless you're looking fora $9 time waster."
76561198050913189,Recommended,296280,14685852,"Posted: 27 February, 2015",all,Ana,I really like this game.  It's got some kinks to work out but im enjoying discovering the recipes and playing.  First let me say this game is designed where the challenge is to discover the recipe.  Im not sure why people think the maker of the game should just tell them off the bat what the recipes are.  That would defeat the purpose of the game.  Which is to think and figure out what the recipes are.I enjoy mixing and matching and it just makes it all the more fun and challenging.  This is a casual game that was first coming off of an ipad to pc.  So im not sure what people where expecting with it.  I did my research first and went in knowing what i was buying.  Still for a game that's been cross platformed i did enjoy it.  If you want to give it a try for something laid back to do than i would recommend this game.
,Not Recommended,296280,17346301,"Posted: 2 August, 2015",all,abenlen,"I really wanted to like this this game.  Heck, I can say that on some level I do.  But  in the end I have to admit that the negatives outweigh the positives.On the plus side, this is a relaxing city builder with a fairly easy to learn crafting system and not much in the way of pressure to do things on the game's timetable.  You gather resouces, you plant farms, you learn recipes (I did so mostly by hitting the wiki on this).  You have the option to do simple production quests.  You can hire wandering serfs to be your employees.  The plants on your farms can wither if you don't harvest them in a timely manner, but that's not really a problem if you hire a farmer to do it for you.  As far as I can see, there really isn't any way to fail this game.  Also, the graphics are charming.  I can't think of another title that offers such a chill gathering/crafting/building experience, and that is pretty refreshing.    All in all this is a low stress game.On the negative side, this is a bit too low stress.   Your character moves very slowly.  There is no way to automate the harvesting of resources, or even to line up actions in a queue.  Pathfinding AI is iffy at best.  The townsfolk you hire really aren't very bright.  Well, perhaps there is some stress.  The controls are very clunky.   I felt like I was navigating my character with oven mitts on.  As far as I can tell, there is no way to rotate the camera, which can be a big issue when trees are in the way of other resources.These negatives feel like they could be fixed fairly easily, but this game feels utter desererted by the game devs.  I asked on the steam forums about the rotating the camera issue, and got no reply from anyone.  As far as I can tell, the devs stopped reading, or at least responding to the the forums months ago.   It feels like I am playing a half done title that the makers just got bored with and wandered off.A real shame, because there is more than a hint of very good game here.  I'm crossing my fingers that the devs will actually come back and listen to the concerns that so many people have.  In it's own way, this game feels like it could have the potential of the much much better, but fundamentaly different ""Don't Starve"".  Saddly, it's hard to really care for, or recommend, a game that has makers that seemingly have stopped caring about months ago.+'s+ Fundamentally a fun, relaxing, stress-free city builder+ Learning Curve is managable+Charming graphics-'s-Character actions are very slow-No way to automate or even queue up actions-AI, from pathingfinding to NPC actions, very weak-Controls slow and clunky-No way to rotate camera-No indication that the devs are still interested in improving this game, or even communicating with the player base.I really hope that I am wrong, and the devs will one day wake up and improve on this title that has so much potential.  But until that happens, the best I can give it is a  3/10."

,Not Recommended,296280,18197104,"Posted: 25 September, 2015",all,camux,"Editing my review after an unfortunate visit to the TownCraft Steam forums.Abandonware.  My previous review was way too nice, even though I mistakenly thought it was an early access title; how fitting it is that this game is left as an unfinished husk, worse than any other early access game I've played.Anyway.  What I would have said back in early February/March 2016 is still true today, because the game was an absolute EXTREME rush to port from IOS and somewhere in that process it was completely and totally abandonded.  Occasionally a person who calls themselves ""Expect Problems"" (fitting name) posts in the forums to ""address"" issues, but a bug report posted in a stickied post in March of 2016 was replied to with:  ""This is a tragic oversight on our part. I will get our designer on this immediately. :-)""  A smiley face!  Of course nothing changed.Avoid, don't buy, and don't blame the community of you do buy it and realize that while it might have been a hit on the iPhone, the port to PC is broken and unfinished to the point of feeling like a very badly watered-down Flash game.  A whole ton of promise piled on top of selling as a rare city/farm sim on Steam, it got them some sales, but you would do better with almost any game in this genre because even Towns, a game lamented for being an early dev-hell fiasco, has about 500 times more content than the ghost of a ""game"" that is TownCraft."
,Recommended,296280,14698325,"Posted: 28 February, 2015",all,Siight,"I recommend this game, so long as you know what you're buying.  This isn't a survival town builder, in fact, there is really no way to lose.This is more a crafting game with a few maps.  Each map, you basically build your small little town, and do quests.  Silver quests grant you money, Gold quests go along with a small story that seems to go across the maps that you build your towns in.  Eventually you finish all the gold quests and unlock the next map (although I think you can unlock them all to start in the settings menu ... but why cheat).  Of course, if you desire you can play on after finishing all the gold quests.To me there is enjoyment in figuring out everything, all the recipees, and how to build all the different buildings.  I guess you can cheat and use a wiki, but thats not very fun.Like i said though, no way to really lose, I assume most that happens when you run out of money is you lose all your workers...however, it's incredibly easy to make money....so i've never actually had that happen to me.All this said, so long as you know what this game is about, I highly recommend it...if you're into that kind of game."

There is no save feature, so a crash 2 hours in basically means you wasted 2 hours. If/When the crashes are fixed I would rate this 10/10 for a casual building/crafting simulation game.Edit: There does seem to be a save feature and my data was saved when I logged in today. This made me extremely happy. If it auto saves then I guess the crashes are not that bad."

,Not Recommended,296280,27939296,"Posted: 28 November, 2016",all,Vanya,"I like the relaxed pace of the game and figuring out how to craft things.It's unfortunate that it's been abandoned because there is massive scope to improve the game and make it truly special. As it stands, there are a few bugs and little reason to keep playing after you've built a town. Stocking the Tavern is tedious and grinding due to the clunky crafting system for food and drink, on top of that you end up with ridiculous amounts of unused resources due to an inability to either sell them to merchants or throw them away. Some quests are impossible to complete if you end up on a map that has not generated a resource not sold by the merchants, and the merchants themselves are a little useless sometimes because they carry only a few coppers. The pathfinding is a nightmare, and the system for removing tree stumps involves right clicking on every single one instead of something more intuitive like cutting down the tree and then removing the stump with a shovel.I'll probably still play it, as I like the initial gameplay, but in the long-term playability stakes, it falls sadly short and is quite disappointing for the price."
,Not Recommended,296280,29304870,Posted: 16 January,all,Aurjay,"The game never was finished, but the developer slapped on a version number of v2.1.6 at the last update, just 3 months after the Early Access game was put out on Steam.  That was the last update, the last communication from the developer of this game.  Valve/Steam really needs to stop all this Early Access game support they are doing.  There have been too many Early Access games now that have abandoned their projects before completing them, most of them seem to be in my library.  You do nothing to protect your customers from these failed projects and our money for purchasing something that is never delivered in full.Really wish that Valve would take responsibility for their actions, letting these Early Access games be sold, when they do not get finished.  This one, just like Starforge, had a version slapped on it to make it seem like it was finished, but anyone who knew what features were promised in these games, know damn well these games never got finished.  We all should receive a full refund for these failed projects."

It isn't a hardcore game, but doesn't hand-hold past the initial tutorial.  It has a loose progression that pushes you along if you let it, but for the most part it is your sandbox to do with as you will.  It isn't  terribly stable on my system (1 crash every few hours), but it is a recent steam release, and hope they will patch up the issues in due time.

All is done with one click. You have to discover the crafting recipes by yourself.You can trade with random people walking by or hire them so you'll have less clicking to do.Tiles look 'ok', animations are basic but that's fine by me.Crashes a lot so far.Don't recommend now but probably will when they smooth things up."
,Recommended,296280,14683047,"Posted: 27 February, 2015",all,Savvycoon,"While I WOULD recommend this game, I have mixed feelings about it.1) The biggest problem that I can find is that it often crashes when you first start playing. Not to mention the fact that my antivirus software thought that it was in fact a virus when I downloaded it and began to play. So far it has crashed four times while I was playing, but I ignored it thinking it was something to do with my computer. After reading other reviews I realize I'm not the only one having issues there.2) As others have stated, the controls are clunky, and after about ten to fifteen minutes of playing  the obvious issues with not walking diagonally and constantly having to re-click things to harvest will eventually make you terribly irritated.3) I agree also that it isn't very polished; in the way of game details - the characters (and avatars) are quite ugly, but the items and background are cutesie and whimsical (which is fine). In the way of gameplay - I also have to agree that it plays almost like it was made for an iPad or Android. Not exactly PC material.4) The crafting userface also isn't user friendly, although since I waited a few days to play after it came out, there is a guide on the Wiki. It's just not currently very thorough.5) Unless you're really into the work put into Simulation/Sandbox games like this, it feels more like work than a game. Personally, I'm mixed on that too. While I love the idea of the game, and sometimes the game itself, it seems like I spend more time trying to fulfill the 'quest' that each scenario brings up rather than just building my town and having fun. :/I'd give it a 6/10. It's definitely replayable, you just have to get past the aggravation of the controls, and the obvious need for serious attention to detail when building towards the main quests. Not to mention the fact that when you first start playing it will crash a few times. So there's obviously some bugs that need to be worked out."

I play it on iPad more often than the computer.The game is slow and you never fight anything, although you can craft weapons to sell to traders. It is a cute town builder where your character has to do everything until you can afford to pay workers and have a house with a bed for them. No battles and no fighting for your life all the time. You harvest, craft, build, and walk around.It has several quirks and you sometimes need to cut down trees to reach parts of the map. Things are sometimes much simpler than you'd think. Like building bridges across water isn't anything special, if you have the wood, click on the water, ta da. Other times it is really complicated, farming with a worker means two wide strips of farms so the worker doesn't get stuck inside as the crops grow up around them.I think it is worth the buy if you want something that you can just pick up and build and put down again. If you want combat you won't find it here. Although, get it for the pizza trees if nothing else."
