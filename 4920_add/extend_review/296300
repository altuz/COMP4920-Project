,Not Recommended,296300,32348766,Posted: 11 June,all,Avyctes,"So I've never written one of these before, but I feel that a warning for prospective buyers is in order.I've played this game a lot as you can see, since (very) early access. Clearly I liked it in the past, but now I'm not so sure. Why?There is very little, if any, testing of a new update before it gets pushed out. Crippling bugs like the game not launching on Mac and/or Linux, black screens and other such delights are often missed and unleashed on unsuspecting players. I seriously wonder if any testing is done at all, these bugs are so bad and so obvious they surely would have found them by just opening the game once. This was somewhat acceptable in early access, but by now it's ridiculous.Class balance is handled in a haphazard way at best. Obvious problems are often ignored or ""fixed"" by doing the wrong thing. Some classes are cleary more powerful than others.Developers have recently added a system that helps friends play together. Fine I suppose. But in the process they removed all automatic team balancing. Apparently it clashed with their new system. This is incredibly stupid. Matches are now wildly unbalanced by default, players switch to the winning team without penalty and teams aren't even scrambled between matches, which is hilarious when half your team leaves between matches because you now face the other full team with just two mates. Again, this is incredibly stupid.A competitive mode has been promised. Last year. Still haven't seen any of it beyond a few second hand rumours. On the other hand, this is probably a good thing because playing competitively with the problems I already mentioned is a bad idea.The hit detection is all server side, so I hope you like dying in cover. Because you will. A lot.If you don't care about any of this, go ahead and get this game. You will probably enjoy it for a while, enough to get your moneys worth out of it. But if you care just a bit, I would stay away for now. Plenty of other games out there after all.Update 16 June '17: a new update was released today and guess what it did? It made the game not launch on mac. Hard to ignore the urge to yell ""I told you so"" at the screen."

It's insane, busy, fast paced, and action packed. Now, normally I don't like fast paced shooters, mostly because I can't keep up and I don't have enough time to play the way I want, but this is totally different. It does fast paced in a way that's fun, and tactical. Each class has it's own unique set of weapons, and there are classes that fight and go against other classes. For example, if you've got an army of people holding a certain area, and you want to counter that, there's a class with auto-pistols, and you can turn invisible to easily run past enemy lines. The only real downside to this game is that it can be hard to find a server sometimes, as it's all player hosted, no dedicated servers. I'd also love to see weapon customization, weapon skins, and more player customization in this game. Not to mention, a campaign. I LOVE to see a campaign for this game, and learn about the lore.In short:Should you get this game? ♥♥♥♥. Yes.Is this a fun game? Damn right it is.Is this a balanced game? For the most part, yes.Is it 100% solid, and complete? No, there's plenty of room to improve, and there's plenty that can be added, but even with that being said, it's still a wonderful game."

More classes and weapons will only enrich this meta.Looks good for the price.Runs well once in-game.ConsVery crude experience: both finding and creating a match is kinda hard and fiddly.Host-based servers: this means if the host leaves, everyone drops from the game.Short version:This is a rough gem that needs a lot of polishment. The ideas and content on the forum and promised features do point towards a great game, but onloy for those that wish to be involved in it.GET THIS GAME!!!--> If you want to participate as the game grows:DON'T GET THIS GAME--> If you want a fully functional and polished game: Wait until the final release =)Long versionI've played this game in its previous incarnation as a f2p service, and here is what I have to say about the Early Access opening.I recommend this gameat this pontonly for people who want to actively participate in its development. The game right now has some serious issues that I'll outline below, but it does have a lot going for it with a wealth of content to come. For those of us that participated in the alpha and beta stages of the f2p incarnation, it's the very same problems back again: hard to find matches and a crude user interface/HUD.While getting a game going is a pain, once you get in a match, however, I've found that my experience is smooth. I have found little LAG and the lack of feedback/HUD polishment is expected for this early release.Content-wise, the three available classes seem to cover everything from close-range brawlers to mid-range fighters and long-range assassins. The skill trees are interesting to play with, but its too soon to know if anything seems unbalanced. The weapons appear to function properly and sound and look good, just as do the new levels.Thanks for reading and I hope the devs will fix these issues soon."
,Not Recommended,296300,32512047,Posted: 17 June,all,Razzeeyy,"Game is not bad, at the core, but some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t design decisions just killing it.1) High ping. Each server for me always 100+ ping. You can't setup proper eu servers?2) Idiotic medkit mechanics. With this cod style game basically every time you're on low HP running to medkit is a suicide. Either introduce auto HP regen for all classes or proper medic classes.3) Weapons are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t (maybe ping is to blame) but even 90% accuracy weapon can't hit♥♥♥♥♥♥even though you're clearly leading your crosshair on a target.4) Mouse sensetivity is totally broken when ADS, basically ADS is useless because it makes different sens for every gun, sniper ADS can feel way slower, but when you ADS in the scope of mere assault but with optical scope, the assault rifle ADS sens gets over the top even higher than your normal sensetivity!! U WOT M8?5) Spawns: it's either spawn camping the unpenetratable enemy spawn doors or vice versa -- enemies (especially snipers) abuse the impenetratability of their spawn doors to stay safe and pop out for a shot when they need it.6) Map design is flawed! Lots of spaces on the maps that are just blank long corridors or squares with totally no cover! And that is in the game that doesn't have auto HP regen! Basically making you a deadman once you're try to cross those areas. Also color scheme of the maps makes it really hard to focus on the fight and figure out which is an actual accesible map route or just a yet another flashy decoration that is meant to confuse and attract your attention.7) Friendly/Enemy outlines take time to appear so that results in trying to shoot a few bullets just to realize it's your teammate poppin outta the corncer. Or you team mates will spoil your position by accidentially checking you because outlines just do not work properly. And sometimes you won't have lighting reflexes shooting at the enemy because you've mistaken it for friendly for a few seconds till the outline appears, by which point you most likely dead.CONCLUSION: Game design in this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I'm requesting refund. Thank you for attention. Have a nice day."

It's very fast paced and has close quarted combat. And the level design reminds me of CoD4. A great start for an Early Access game! Here's a list of pros and cons:Pros:+Shiny and cartoonish visuals (I love realistic cartoon graphics)+Decent map design+Good firing sounds+HUD and menu is pretty good for a game this early+Optimized for integrated GPUs+Only $6.99+It's funCons:-Weapon models are too big (I mean they're too close to the camera) and pretty bland looking-There should be a back button on the setting menu so if you accidently open it you don't have to confirm your changes every time-Shouldn't show the scoreboard when you die-Not that many players (Game needs more publicitiy somehow)-Shouldn't have to choose your class everytime you die, instead make it like TF2 where you press a certain button with a class specific menu-For some reason on the controls menu the text for knife isn't there-If you're in the menu and you die, it'll take you off the menu and show the person who killed you which is kind of annoying-The chat has some issues and gets in the way of the game. (For example, you have to erase the filler text ""Type here..."" or else it will make it into your message)-Ragdolls and player animations are kind of clunkySome suggestions:=A Call of Duty style killcam would be cool since it's better than watching the person who killed you walk around=The picture of the class that you're using in the health HUD is kida weird and it should be a cross or something like that=Linux support (I know not that many people are on Linux, but it never hurts)=AchievementsAs of now, it's a great Early Access title and it's a lot of fun for a small price. I hope the devs can fix the issues I listed and you should consider getting it."

Im already writing this review within 20 minutes of gameplay and the interface is smooth, the gameplay is fast and everything is so fluid. You can notice the developers put a lot of hard work into this game to please this community. Ballistic Overkill features various typical classes involing stealth, heavy, sniper and assault that is almost starting to be balanced in the game since it is an Early Access. This game has risen in the standard of First Person Shooters in terms of optimization, interface look, graphics and especially gameplay.

Despite pinning entire teams in their spawn, and in rare occasions playing flawlessly, the ""winning"" team still often loses. Performance of either team doesn't seem to matter 90% of the time.Gameplay overall is slow; the game punishes you for doing any action faster than a walk by alerting your prescence to the enemy maps, so both teams typically move at a crawling speed.Significant delays to attacks and actually hitting the target are apparent, especially with grenades. Its not uncommon to fire, and have the bullet/grenade hit a solid second after actual impact.The TL;DR message, is that I respect them for what they're trying to do...but this is NOT the ""Call of Duty + Overwatch"" baby they very boldly claimed it was in the trailer. The worst bit is there is actually a similar, if not better version of this game out already. Look for ""Dirty Bomb"" on steam, you'll get everything this game offers and more there."

,Not Recommended,296300,33084421,Posted: 1 July,all,Shield,"Since this is a very pressing issue, I have to address this matter.This game is utterly broken.Aquiris needs to implement some auto-balancing system, that runs before EVERY match, because right now, when you play a game, it is not rare to see high level (read 50+) players crumpled up in one team, and players in their first 10 levels in the other, NO EXCEPTIONS! Another glaring design f-up is, that it's not a problem to make a match be 1v6, when all your teammates leave.Aquiris may have provided (a pretty bs) reason, why the autobalance was removed - aparently it's because of the friend matching system, they wanted to implement, didn't play well with autobalancer. Well, you could have modified the autobalancer slightly, to make sure it didn't screw up partys, squads, platoons, or whatever other name has Aquiris decided to use for a group of friends, that will always end up on the same team.TL;DR:Aquiris - fix your bugs, screw-ups and add the autobalancer backPotential Buyers - Don't buy this, until at least the autobalancer is added back, trust me, the gameplay is bad, for a lack of a better word that Steam won't censor, at the moment."
,Recommended,296300,22295858,"Posted: 7 April, 2016",all,T H O T   S W A T,"There was once a browser game called Ballistic, and it was absolutely phenomenal for a browser game. I know it doesn't sound impressive to be the best browser game around, but it wasreallygood. Probably better than many of the games currently on Steam, but that isn't exactly an achievement either. I logged many hours in that game (I know, what a casual scrub) until Aquiris, the developer, took down the browser game and put a more polished version on Steam.This game brings back so many memories and nostalgia,  yet the game feels somewhat different. It's like Aquiris kept all the parts of Ballistic that I liked, but removed the bad parts. It keeps most of the game mechanics, so on the most basic gameplay level, it feels the same. I was always a fan of how while anyone can pick up this game and have a good time, the skill ceiling is also very high, and it's possible to become very good at this game. There are classes, and each has unique weapons and skills. Players can gain an edge by playing to the advantages and disadvantages of a certain class. It is easy to pick up a class, but it is much harder to truly master it, just like in the old game. Even the best players can always improve, making for a game that can be very competitive if that is your thing. This competitive nature is further reinforced by the fact that all weapons and skills are available immediately for all players, and that Aquiris has removed the microtransactions and pay-to-win aspect that haunted the original game. Immediately, new players are presented with a level playing field, and do not have to deal with more experienced enemies toting massively overpowered weapons.This game isn't 100% perfect, and there are some balance issues. Just like the original game, spawn camping is a major issue, and it is sometimes impossible to get out of spawn without being killed by the entire enemy team waiting to kill you. Thankfully, a small area of spawn is protected, but Aquiris should really do more about it. In addition, some weapons are ridiculously unbalanced, such as the grenade launcher. It doesn't really take skill to get kills: just spam grenades in the general direction of the enemy and profit. It should really be nerfed so that it rewards practice and skill.Despite a few issues, Ballistic Overkill is a very enjoyable but difficult game. Unfortunately, not many people play this game. There are usually a few populated servers with some very dedicated players. Sadly, this game is far too overlooked. It deserves more players."

On that note I'd also like to say that I'm not looking for a CS:GO clone, by all means a semi-tactical fps that feels more like COD or even Alliance of Valiant Arms, I'm all for.I highly encourage that some on the team go play some other F2P FPS games and ""borrow"" ideas from some, AVA is for sure one that has a couple of things that would do well here.Looking at your Early access sum-up I can see that the UI is being re-worked, but before that I was madly clicking around trying to change class setups, it would be nice to either-grey it out for now or some little pop-up letting me know this section isn't fully working yet.The loadouts REALLY need mouse-over help windows on what the skills do as I still don't fully know what the Berserker class does.I beg you, let me access settings while in-game to tweak mouse, keyboard or FOV adjustments.Any chance to give access to the console for minor tweaks?Final note! I have a very hard rule about never buying Early Access/Kickstarter, after being burned so many times.

Running around and shooting people down is fun. Graphics are sweet and it runs well. User interface is simple ,well-organized and good looking.However It's not the most unique fps game you will ever play. Most of the times, it looks too generic, reminding me of 'modern combat' on mobile but without the pay to win elements. There could be some more adjustments, content and balancing as well.Seeing its potential, I'll recommend it. It's not a bad game."

What I want to say with this is, that this game in 1,5 years has developed so much in so many different ways, something that the old Ballistic couldn't reach (in my opinion). Ballistic Overkill is a fast-paced first person shooter with 7 different classes with unlimited weapons. Corcerning the classes, overall, they are prety balanced, even tho I still think Shadow is way too OP (having too much mobility and dealing too much dmg with melee attacks, katanas). About the gameplay itself, Ballistic Overkill is a very smooth game running beautifully even on old machines with old hardware and software. The drop system is actually good but I think it should be better if we could get a legendary skin for every weapon, not just to a specific weapon (f.e. Curator is the only weapon with the legendary skin).Overall, it's a great game and I totally recommend this!"

First it started off as a free-to-play browser game, and at the beginning was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and laggy and did look bad like all of them. Eventually it began to look better and feel better, until it was _the_ best browser game ever. Super good graphics, nice feel, interesting guns. Now its back in that beta (early access), becouse dews decided to get rid off their publisher and make the game paid in steam, to make it not pay to win and much cooler and so much more better. In my opinion, its totally worth it to buy Ballistic Overkill right now. Yes it has bugs and stuff, but its getting better and better all the time. I believe, that eventially it will be one of the top 10 FPS ever made. PS: skins and new HUD coming in next update ;)./What is good-Graphics are super good, if compared to how good pc performance it needs. If u have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop, turn settings low and get good fps, when u have basic good gaming rig, the high settings truly are beatiful.-Gameplay is superb. Even more important than graphics, is the gameplay. Ballistic Overkill has lovely fast based feel in it. Weapons are balanced. U can choose from sword to grenade launcher, depending on your class. And u have plenty of classes to choose from; shadow to wraith they all have their cons and pros.-OVERKILL! Weapon Equipment system lets you to pick up any weapon for that class either secondary or primary. For example, shotgun and assault riffle, sniper riffle and smg, lmg and assault riffle. It creates super nice feel of freedom-Devs are really working hard for this, Unity is not easy to use (I know from my own experience).They also have Gamemaster (name: GM Ballistic Overkill) on facebook, whos in several groups and u can always connect him if you have found new bug or just need to ask something.-Community is good, everybody is friendly and helpful ^^. There always fits in some salty players tho. There also are clans, bigger and smaller, where u can really easily find friends to play with.-No hackers. Seriosly, not even single one./What is bad-It's still early access, so there is bugs and problems-There could really be more players, but usually there is server that you can join in.DROP IN LIKE IF U FOUND THIS REVIEW ANY GOOD OR HELPFUL, IT MEANS A LOT :)"

Just pick a gun from a list which you will unlock as you level up the character. It reminds of the seige except fast paced.- most people play sniper since the guns are one shot one kill but other characters are pretty good. they are all different just like overwatch and rainbow 6 the seige.- Maps are fun to play. they are unique. after each match ends you will vote for another one.-ITS LESS THAN $15. For the ammount of money youre paying its a lot of fun to play- The game starts fast and the UI is very simple and smooth. I havent found any glitch or hacckers yet.- No micro transaction. I hope they create one though for skins just so they can get extra income. Anyways its def not a pay to win game. everyone is on the same level.Cons:- If youre a begginer, its hard to get used to the game. Even though it doesnt take a lot to learn how to play. I have clocked less than 10 hrs and I am already pretty good. I am usually in the top 4. So if they had ranked match that would have been awesome.- Not a lot of players when compared to other games. but the list is growing. After steam summer sale started I have noticed a huge growth in number of players so thats somewhat a good thing.- People normally pick the same map almost all the time. It doesnt give you an option to select the same map after you just played it but from those selections its alyways the same. Its good if youre a begginer. It will help you get used to the maps.Other than the ones I mentioned its totally worth the money. I am trying to get my friends to play this game now. I am getting addicted to this game."

Someone mentioned it's like a cross between Overwatch and CoD and they're 100% correct.  Gameplay is fast-paced and smooth, and the gunplay is sooooo satisfying.  Controls are tight and fluid and very satisfying.  It's only $12 and I bought it as an impulse purchase and I would have 100% paid over $20 for this with no regrets.Essentially you jump into a Free for All, Team Deathmatch, or two different styles of King of the Hill maps, picking 1 of 7 classes.  Each class has its own weapons and passive skills, which you unlock more of both as you play.  This game also features loot crates, but you dont need to spend money to open them, they're 100% free and loaded with tons of cool character/weapon skins.  It doesn't make me as salty as Overwatch does sometimes, since respawn times are instant and the gameplay is super fast-paced anyway.  There ARE objectives, but the game is still centered around just wiping the floor with the enemy team.  It's incredibly satisfying.During my 3-4 hours streaming this game, I convinced roughly 5 other people to buy the game and they played with me.  It was a good time.I HIGHLY recommend this game.  Be sure to check out my stream above if you're unsure.10/10 Will be playing this a lot."

The devs have moved away from the F2P model to the traditional model of buying the game once and unlocking everything. This allows the game to be much more balanced, and doesn't encourage paywalls and Pay-to-Win balancing like a F2P model often tends to do.Pros:Cheap (as of the time of me writing this)Decently diverse loadout customization (I only say decent due to some instances still left where there are strictly better loadout choices, but the skill system helps cover for this)Currently has 6 unique classes, with 3 more planned (both the current and future classes are truly unique as well, for the most part. There are some obvious comparisons to be made to games like TF2, but overall this game distinguishes itself quite nicely)Great-looking graphics that are deceptively easy to run at full capacityDevs that are transparent, and actually involve the community in the development process during Easy Access (you can check out their public task board (which they've linked in the game description) to see what is being worked on or comment on their update changelogs on Steam, and they will actually listen and respond to comments from both sources)Cons:Small playerbase (mainly due to the game not being very well-known)Not all the maps are are balanced, and some enable spawncamping (Sunnsquare Mall is one of the worst examples of this)Can feel a bit too fast-paced when first starting outOverall, if you're looking for something new to try in the class-based shooter genre, Ballistic Overkill is well worth the $6.99 price tag. The balance isn't perfect yet and the community is small, but this game has loads of potential if the FPS community at large is willing to give it a chance."

It started out life as a browser game (which i was not there for) and it does sometimes show in terms of it's quality and design. Is the game bad? No. Is it flawed? Yes, in several ways. The gameplay is a mix between class-based shooters like TF2 and Deathmatch style shooters such as Quake or Unreal Tournament. The modes/maps are selected at a random vote at the end of matches and there's a little bit in the way of customization for your characters. It's a very fast game with plenty of dying and respawning in quick succession, which i personally feel would get boring after a little while. Not to mention even on a beast computer like mine, the game runs horribly often choppy and laggy, the awful netcode doesn't help either on 200 ping EU servers. But despite this, there is something satisfying about cloak stabbing people with a rad ninja sword. So i'm not really sure how to feel about the game. It's not crap, but it's not gold either.PROS+ Decent Graphics for a cheap game+ Gameplay is fluid and fast paced+ Each class feels unique+ Character CustomizationCONS- Feels like a browser game- Maps get old rather quickly- Bullet Sponge health- Feels very generic- POORLY OPTIMIZEDBOTTOM LINEI personally  like  the game verry much.

O///O-matchmaking is a problem in this game where you can only get four game modes: king of the hill, capture point, team deathmatch and free 4 all but still... yet no competitive mode. the lobbys are usually empty or usually full making it difficult to find a match. there is a ""quick match"" option but you may be placed in a lobby with one person making it no fun. in terms of player matching this game is not the best for it. if youre just an aspirant or a ""noob"" than you may be unlucky and can be placed in a lobby full of ♥♥♥♥ing veterans, wanderers, noteworthys and fugitives and get your♥♥♥♥♥absolutely demolished. then again the lobbys are usually empty so buy the game so i can have a friend in this lonely abyssoverall: 6/10 meh. the game could be better. this game has potential so i hope it doesnt screw up like those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ f2p browser shootersedit: ok after i wrote this review i had some problems in some game lobbys. if i joined a server with a high enough ping, i become ""invisible"" and my character model gets stuck in spawn. now whenever i got a kill people would call me a hacker like ""oh how did you kill me? youre in the ♥♥♥♥ing spawn. ♥♥♥♥ing hacker"" now i used this ""glitch"" in capture point and king of the hill so i wouldnt have to kill anybody and get called a hacker again. although i enjoyed trolling people the devs really need to fix the pink screen and this ""glitch"""

You start with all classes (2 still haven't been added yet) and all of the weapons are available immeadietly. This means no more long, painful grinds to get 1 class or gun then find out you need to pay IRL money to keep the gun.  Though it may seems dead at times, when you find a match (i reccomend quick match because that puts you in matches with other players) you're gonna have a lot of fun. All classes are quite balanced and each one is a signifigant threat to another. There really is no OP or UP class/weapon, as everything has it's own unique advantage.

Its dropped the F2P tag for a price tag. Limited by 3 maps and 3 modes pretty standard stuff so far. Skills, classes and loadouts that will suit, including sniper scum.

Well, take everything that made the game fun then, buff the graphics out a little bit, and take away any polish the gameplay had before it was moved to steam.This game has quite a few issues, and very few positive additions. I bought this game expecting something... what that something was... nostalgia? Who knows, but this game is not very fun to play.Pros:Classes-Ballistic Overkill brings back only a few of the classes (from what I can tell when first starting) and allows you to tweak their loadouts and skills immediately. From the main menu, you can look through the Vanguard, Berserker, and Wraith character classes, and choose what type of weapons and skills they start with.Skills-In terms of skills, you no longer need to grind out the game and level up in order to gain as many skill points as are needed to upgrade through the two individual skill trees. You start with a base of 20 skill points. Whether or not you can earn more skill points while playing the game for longer periods of time, is unknown to me.Weapons-The weapons in this game have been redone in the sense that you can now select any of the available class specific weapons at any time. I thought this was a much better idea compared to what was originally intended in the free to play model (you needed to either grind out your character and earn an in game currency to buy additional weapons, or you could spend real money in order to quickly acquire the weapons you wanted) since players like myself and many others hate microtransactions (yes, I understand why they do this in F2P models). You can select between different assault rifles, submachine guns, sniper rifles, and sidearms.Graphics-The graphics look much better in this version of the game than it did when it was still playable in a browser, The maps and weapon models actually look decent/quite good and I honestly believe that this game should have been a full retail release rather than a browser game.Cons:F2P w/ MT's to Full Steam Release-Now, because this game used to be a free to play model, the mechanics worked in a certain way that was very fitting, but now that you have to pay for it on steam with some of the main components taken out, it really struggles to shine through as a diamond in the rough, rather than being just another boring rock.Lack of Rewarding Gameplay/Microtransactions-Because you have all of the weapons unlocked from the beginning, there is no incentive to grind the game or casually play it for unlocks. It's great that there aren't any more microtransactions, but it isn't saying much when the only thing that you do is run, jump and shoot.Gamemodes-How is this different from most modern shooters, you ask? Well, if I recall, there were only two game modes in the broswer version of the game, and the same applies for this version. You have Team Deathmatch or a Domination style game mode where there are three capture points that can be taken to gain score over the enemy team. The more capture spots you have, you more points you earn towards winning. This isn't necessarily bad, but it seems boring to only have these two game modes, with nothing else to choose from, and Ballistic Overkill doesn't do much of anything to spice it up.Class Limitation-Originally, this game has additional characters to select, but I'm not quite sure if you have to work for them as intended, just like with the weapons, or if they haven't fully been added into the game. The only three classes you can play as are the three that I mentioned previously.Player Models/Clipping-Although the graphics do look nicer, I have seen player models clipping through the walls due and players who have invested their skills in movement speed clip through the map, other player models, and other items throughout the map. In regards to this, I have also seen a few hackers in the game already, which makes it even more frustrating to see them with higher movement speed that is unattainable, and makes the death that much more bitter.Spawns-Player spawns are just as bad as before. The original maps have come back, and nothing has been done to modify them (other than graphically) or make them more suitable and comfortable to play on. I can't recall how many times I have just waited in front of the enemy spawn and shot down enemy players as soon as they come out. On a few of the maps, the spawns are too close, but it doesn't take away from the fact that players spawn in the same area every time after they die, allowing enemies to gather around the ""forcefields"" and waiting for them to come out so they can be one tapped. There have been multiple times where it has happened to myself, and gets increasingly frustrating every time, especially when your team isn't even trying to take them out, but rather run into their spawn and do the same.Sprint Key?-Does the sprint key do anything other than activate your skills? Your character walks at a snails slowly, but when you hold down the sprint key, it seems like it doesn't change at all half the time. The only noticable difference is if you select a different class where your skills somehow boost your overall movement speed.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------There are many more issues that I could talk about, and probably others that I could find, but I'm not willing to put more hours into this game, and I can assure you, it isn't even worth the $7.00 USD. Most of the other people who have left reviews on this game seem to feel like this game is better than before, but I really don't see any improvement at all. If anything it feels like it has taken a step back. There are so many things that are generic and bland about this game, anything from design choice, to gameplay mechanics (if some of you think that the devs of this game have added amazing and refreshing gameplay mechanics that aren't taken directly from a Triple A title, than I believe you may have some brain damage) that make it annoying to play.Player Base-There used to be a steady fan base playing this game (There weren't that many people playing this game before, but at least the servers were populated and you could find players either leaving and rejoining matches, or you would be put into a match as soon as you searched) and it seems like this has changed durastically. I believe when I was playing, I had only seen 3 available servers.TLDR; I understand that this game is early access. There is a reason why there is a bold headline stating such before you purchase a game such as this, but there are quite a few issues that I feel shouldn't even be in this version of the game. The developers couldn't keep the game alive on browsers because they were ending support of the Unity Engine. If there were any way to get my message across, or actually talk to the developers on ideas, or how to make the game better, I would do so in a heart beat. This game was a lot of fun to play, even when it was just in a browser, which was really cool. There could have been other steps involved between the liquidation of browser support to the full release of the game on steam which could have eased the game into some better light. Hopefully, the development team will roll out updates consistantly and things will get rolling. As for now, the game has is too lack luster and has too many issues for me to want to invest any more time or money into it."

And I'll say this is a lot better than the old F2P one.-The learning curve is small for players with experience in FPS game before, the hard part is about picking a class and loadout to fit a situation.-Each classes provided many playstyle and build. I've seen marksman revolver'd people in the face and wrath running around with SMG. And just like the dev said, no wimpy support....everyone's a killer. There is always a way to counter someone. Seriously if you think there's a shadow coming for you, stop b*tching and grab a shotgun.....or just go for noscope if you're that desperate.-High level weapons did not means it's good. I've seen many pros stomping people with low level weapons. And the starting rifle for wrath can 1-hit-bodyshot everyone except tank.-The servers is kinda good, I rarely see problem with them. Just there're not enough people in it and the ping-limited servers is always a ghost town.-The community is quite friendly, but can get quickly salted when it's a one-sided stomp. Or when there's too many shadows. (I told ya, get those damn shotgun) And the dev are listening and responding to the player's questions and opinion. Reporting hacker is a bit tricky, but the dev have guidelines for reporting them in the forum.-Never understimated the Vanguard, these guys maybe a generic, boring FPS trooper. But their weapons are quite great and suited for every situation. (And their late game shotgun is a beast.)-The lockboxes system is nice, one lockbox every 48 hours. You'll get those lockboxes quite fast. If you don't like this game then sell those lockboxes to get your money back. Maybe you'll give this game another chance when you finish selling your lockboxes.Overall this game has great potential, all it need is more people and a bit more balancing.If you're looking for a casual, fast-paced shooter. Then this one is for you."

The ninja could, for example, have traps, or mines.Skin diversity is annoying and the lack of races is also annoying.  Not that it affects gameplay however it does affect one's desire to play it.All characters run the same damn speed. When does this actually happen? Environmental considerations would be epic.

What I really love about this game is that with it's relatively small download size, it packs a lot of fun and enjoyment, some of which I find rather more promising than black ops 3. I have it in my library, but I can't really urge myself to play it because I see so much more enjoyment in Ballistic Overkill. Right from when you launch the game, you click play, having picked a class every time you load in, and you immediately have a match within seconds and the intermission between them, is literally seconds. No waiting, no annoying bugs or problems with the game, and at the moment, no hackers at all. For the $12, I'd say it's well worth the money, but on sale for more than 50% off, it's a no-brainer."

It started out life as a browser game (which i was not there for) and it does sometimes show in terms of it's quality and design. Is the game bad? No. Is it flawed? Yes, in several ways. The gameplay is a mix between class-based shooters like TF2 and Deathmatch style shooters such as Quake or Unreal Tournament. The modes/maps are selected at a random vote at the end of matches and there's a little bit in the way of customization for your characters. It's a very fast game with plenty of dying and respawning in quick succession, which i personally feel would get boring after a little while. Not to mention even on a beast computer like mine, the game runs horribly often choppy and laggy, the awful netcode doesn't help either on 200 ping EU servers. But despite this, there is something satisfying about cloak stabbing people with a rad ninja sword. So i'm not really sure how to feel about the game. It's not crap, but it's not gold either.PROS+ Decent Graphics for a cheap game+ Gameplay is fluid and fast paced+ Each class feels unique+ Character CustomizationCONS- Feels like a browser game- Maps get old rather quickly- Bullet Sponge health- Feelsvery generic-POORLY OPTIMIZEDBOTTOM LINEFor a short burst of fun every now and again i see no harm in Ballistic Overkill, but if you're expecting something more competitive and balanced i would recommend playing something else like Counterstrike or even Team Fortress 2.

Maps too small, putting an emphasis on which team has the most map control. If you are in a good team with a solid map control, you are already going to win because the enemy team has no place to position themselves for counter-attacking. If the maps were slightly larger and the spawns are put in different areas so that there is less spawn camping, I think the game would've been more fun. My other issue is the lack of severs available as well as the server lag. Most of the servers I've seen are geared toward outside of U.S., such as South America, Europe, and Asia. As for the lag, there is a delay between the nade being thrown and you receiving the damage. So if I see a nade being thrown at me, it takes about half a second until that nade registers that I've been killed or taken damage. Last but not least, what makes me set this game aside is the fact that before I could even react to an enemy shooting behind my back or shoot when an enemy is already in my field of view, I am already dead in less than a few seconds."

The classes are still being developed for balance yet the game is almost flawless and very fun once you find your NICHE of skills mixed with guns. I have played thousands of other FPS games starting from CSGO on pc and Golden Eye 007 on N64 back in the day even the very first encounter of an FPS scroller like Dynomite Duke for those hardcore game fans. This game has a strong fan base and very nice devs who really want a new game to take over the mundane repetitive release of yearly games I.E COD, BF, etc etc."

It's a fast paced FPS game which features multiple classes each with their own perks and weapons. You can gradually unlock more by playing which opens ways for you to customize your character. Personally I liked the ninja the most as he's very fast and does lots of damage within close range.I think Ballistic Overkill has come a long way since my previous review and although the game still doesn't do anything new in terms of game modes, it does what it does very well: fast paced FPS gameplay within interesting environments.Also the game isn't too heavy on your computer and it looks great!Give it a try!"
,Recommended,296300,31460370,Posted: 30 April,all,Psychloaked,Pros:- Fast Enjoyable FPS shooter- Many dedicated servers- No immediatly noticeable overpowered gun or class.- Progression System in this game actually takes some time with leveling each class up as you earn xp in game while you play the class.- Cool Skins in this game- Melee isn't an instant kill in this game (like older call of duty games) and has pretty low damage making only melee gameplay hardCons:- Spawn trapping on certain maps- A lack of players- Certain popular game modes like; King of the Hill and Team Deathmatch. Making Free for all and Capture (Domination) a rarity.- Grenades must weigh an ounce because the throw distance of a grenade is a little too far in this game. This can be irriating when people are spamming their frag grenades in the King of the Hill game mode.

So many shooters are gray and brown.The negatives I sincerely hope is early access exclusive.- I have lost connection mid game (100mb Internet).- Some weapons seem too powerful (balancing issues).- Some character customization would be nice.- It can be hard to see if someone is on your team or not. Everyone look the same.- It’s slightly strange that not even one character is female.- I’m not very good at it.I like it.

At least the skins look pretty, but only if you actually get them. If you're looking for a drop-in twitch based shooter with speed manipulation (bhop) then this game is for you. The level system only unlocks perks and guns so RPG shouldn't be applied to this game. Apparently there's a lot of spawn trapping and that turns a lot of people off. I don't endorse spawn trapping (90% of the time), and it feels bad on my end. Spawn trapping feels good because you are essentially locking your opponents in so you'll always know where to put your crosshairs on. But it doesn't feel good when you are the one being spawn trapped with a 0:20, 1:23 or even 2:19 K/D ratio. We were all noobs once and felt the sh!thole of spawn trapping. It's just a greedy move to get easy kills. So watch out for Spawn Trapping when purchasing this game. And be mindful of your ping. It really matters."

,Recommended,296300,31158167,Posted: 15 April,all,{Art_Of_War}Archon,"Dispite my play hours, I've been playing it for couple hours already on the fb version. Let's tell you guys about the gamePROS:GAME IS VERY FLEXIBLEyou can choose a class to counter another, really! For example, ""Melee"" counters ""Snipers"", while ""Bombers"" counters ""Melees"", and so do ""Snipers"" counters bombers"". It's alamost like Overwatch or TF2, but they have various passives that you can change, like recoil reduction, invisiblity while moving, or damage resistanceOBJECTIVE BASED GAMEWhat I mean is, it's like Overwatch or Paladins or TF2. Yup, you get it. But there's no ""payloads"" those stuff, there's 4 game modes- Capture Points- King of the hill- Team deathmatch- Free for allNO PAY TO WINIt's like CSGO, you are only able to buy weapon skin or character skins. You cannot buy levels or something that give another people advantage. But the drops are awesome! Which means that the drops cost a alot because not much people plays the game. Certain weapons unlock at certain levels, so even you got $$$$ doesn't make you become goodLESS HACKERS*I can't guarentee that the server have no hackers"". Back in the fb version, a lot of hackers appeared, they can kill you even you've respawned. But now it's over already, don't forget this game also have VAC enabled.EASY LEARN, HARD TO MASTERThe game is pretty straight forward, this game is almost like COD,  there's almost 0% recoil on guns (but there's still have), so you don't really need to spend lots of time practising recoil. Meanwhile you can spend dozens of time mastering your skills, like when to use your knife, how to deal with a class that is your hardest counter (like snipers against assassins), and so on.CONS:BULLET AND DAMAGE CALCULATION IS NOT THAT GOODWell, like someone is hitting you and you run into a wall (when you almost die and the person is still shooting you), you will die for some reason. I don't know if it is the character hitboxes problems or what, but the calculation isn't that good, but not horrible and still playable. (Maybe it's wall bang?) *TBH the bullet damage calculation is not very bad, but it's just calculate a little bit late, like 0.04 seconds?*NOT MANY PLAYERSI mean, it's not because the game have low players playing, but it's the server problem. There's always 200+ people online everyday, but maybe not in your region, like if you're playing on SEA (south east asia) and you play at the morning, chances are you can't really play the game due to lack of players. I mean, because you can't connect to servers like South America due to the ping problems except you have REALLY REALLY good internet connection.MAP IS LIMITEDWell yeah, it's kinda limited right now, and the map isn't big indeed. Everytime if the match is over, you have to pick 4 maps with 4 different gamemodes, all different, there won't be 2 same maps or gamemodes everytime, and it's a voting, if you don't like FFA, chances are you're going to find another server or just play with it.DIFFERENCE WITH FB VERSIONWell, the skill tree is gone now, GLHF BOIS! It's acutally kinda limited now, there's not kamikaze grenadier anymore ($#*@ DATS MY FAV SKILL). Anyways, if you played the FB version of it, it's not that good actually, but the healing system improved, you don't have to go back to base to heal yourself.Weapons have changed, you get weapons by your level, not lockboxes anymore, i really remember that one time i got a legendary ""P90"" (i actually forgot the name, but the weapons look like P90 tho), I use it on Shadow and i got dozens of kills, but the weapon only lasted 2 weeks because, yeah weapons are limited that time, either you buy lockboxes with your in game currency or use $$$$$ to buy weapons #P2W, yeah, it's kinda P2W before but now it's not anymore.Some maps have undergone some changes, while some remain the same, like the sun square mall still remains the same, Overhead have some changes, but only 1 new map =c.Developers if you're reading this please add more maps, because you didn't really add many maps.SummaryGreat FPS, RPG game.But due to lack of players sometimes you can't really play (on certain time)Gameplay is interestingGameplay 10/10Interest 8/10Community 8/10 (There's no trashtalkers or toxic players in the game, really!)Overall: 9/10"

Currently 7 classes for you to individually level and get weapons, abilities, and other special stuff for them. (Every class has their own non-changeable passive abilities too!) The only microtransactions you can make are from the Community Market to buy weapon skins or loot chests for weapon skins, and the only DLC is skins for the characters which I personally think they did really well with.The price is extremely good for such a high quality game in my opinion, it's very addictive, progess feels good with getting new weapons/equipment every time you level a character, the balance is actually pretty good even though some of the other reviews are biased because those reviewers likely only play one or two classes, and like Overwatch every class counters other classes, AND is countered by other ones. If you can become decent at playing more than 3 classes you're good!"

The animations were good and everything was always so smooth, and even tho it was an in-browser game it wasn't really a pay-to-win type of game although money certainly helped lol I played the game for many years and got a couple great weapons, one which was the ☆☆☆☆☆ Golden halloweem Prybar that I won from a chest during the Halloween event and I absolutely loved that gun. It's the one I used the most and I still remember it to this day. And that's why I am writing this review. I just bought Ballistics Overkill a couple days ago and was immediately impressed by how simple yet smooth everything seemed. The animations are even better and smoother but..... I was extremely saddened and  disappointed when I found out that you no longer have chests I can earn from playing the game, those chests are really what made the game so great because I can earn great stuff too, it's what made me play it as much as I did. I've played probably 10 hours worth already and have everything unlocked for the tank. 17 levels. That's it. And I have a couple of stuff unlocked for other characters too. Now I know you do get chests but all I've gotten so far is two camos that (to be completely honest) are very plain if not ugly looking. Now I am not writing this so bash the game, i writing this to say that I want those chests back lol and I can't wait because I know you guys and do so much more with this game and that makes me excited.

,Recommended,296300,34255146,Posted: 15 August,all,NEWater,"Ballistic Overkill may look like your run of the mill trashy F2P FPS where players rely on cash guns to win. But it isn't.The devs have managed to knock something special out of the park here. The movement has a fluidity which reminds me much of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. It's not a case of holding down LMB to win, when recoil is significant and requires a steady hand to control. Battlefield-like ballistics means taking long-range shots requires good positioning and judgment.Weapons, while varied,  are surprisingly well-balanced. Unlike most shooters where 1-3 weapons are the meta picks and are used in every match, each weapon appears to be useful in their own way. Some may be mediocre in ADS but great in hipfire or vice versa. Assault rifles with short range sights have more ammo, and the same rifle type with long range sights have less ammo to balance things out. Grenade launchers, where available, are not one-hit kill noob tube affairs and are useful for flushing opponents out of corners, or emergency burst damage in close range.And yes, there are stealth mechanics. While they may seem really boring to play against, they're not OP or impossible to play against. Shadow, the stealth character with the ninja sword may be cloaked, but his cloaked form is easy to see if your situational awareness is decent, and he makes a loud sound whenever he goes in and out of stealth. This is an obvious giveaway which makes him vulnerable, and any careless Shadow player can get rekt with a shotgun to the face.Wraith is the sniper class who has an obvious yellow outline when in stealth mode, so he's also possible to go against. Because the game isn't hitscan and uses ballistics, being good at movement means you have a better fighting chance by dodging sniper shots.The community, while small by multiplayer PC standards, is quite active and growing rapidly. Discounting the usual few ♥♥♥♥♥ who have yet to reach puberty, community members on the official Discord server are more than happy to welcome new players and will help with any questions. It's obvious that this game came from F2P roots, but the devs seem determined to want to deliver a polished experience without having to rely on microtransaction cancer to keep the lights on.I can get behind that."

Do you enjoy running around as an invisible dude with a sword that can 1 hit most people in the back? Do you like non regenerative health? Then this is the game for you! This game features 7 unique characters each with their own unlocks for playing and leveling them up. Some characters, such as the shadow (affectionately nicknamed ""invisible sword ♥♥♥♥♥"" get a cool sword that can 1 hit people from behind as well as your choice of guns from dual automatic pistols to SMG's! Also he's invisible while sprinting. Other characters, like the wraith can use snipers, that tend to 1-hit most characters on bodyshots. He's also invisible while standing still. I don't play the other characters much but they're alright I guess. The game has a pretty fast pace for most of the gamemodes (fast time to kill from what I've noticed) and the characters can move pretty fast at times.The game features a crate system where after each game there's a chance for a crate to drop, but unlike most other games with a similar system the crates don't cost any money to open, which is a real nice change from other games (Looking at you, counterstrike). There are 10 maps and most of them are pretty small but there are a few decent sized maps. If you play a lot of first person shooters like call of duty, counterstrike, halo, you'll feel at home in this surprisingly good game. There is a bit of a skill gap where some of the older players can completely destroy some newer players but since I've played thousands of hours of first person shooter games it wasn't much of an issue.PROS-cheap (only 6 bucks)-surprisingly good-Reminds me a lot of call of duty: modern warfare 2-Many unique playstyles generated from the characters-perks systemCON-No weapon costumization yet (not sure if it's being planned but it's not that big of an issue)-Low player counts (You can still find a full server to join most of the time, but there's not really much of a choice if you don't like the people in the server you're playing or if you don't like the gamemode/map that's being played-Some bugs (expected in an early access game), some maps have environmental sounds that are DEAFENINGLY LOUD AND NO SOUND OPTION WILL LOWER IT BESIDES GOING INTO WINDOWS SOUND MIXER.-no offline/bot play (that I can find), which could be a problem if the game where to die sometime down the road.I rate this game a solid 8/10 in its current state and would recommend you to buy it if you're a fan of multiplayer first person shooters"

I bought this game expecting to have the same playerbase, stability, and fun as the previous release. I didn't really expect too much as this is an ""Early Release"" title, and this game barely lived up to my low expectations. There are plenty more issues that I thought there would be some of which include: Latency issues, lack of players, crappy FPS balance and optimization, hitboxes, gun balance, and servers - just to name a few. My biggest complaint is that the amount of players in a server more than drastically effects your Framerate - by this I mean a single player in a map with me drops my FPS a whole 5 frames - fix that. Also, I really hope there is a lot more content in the future as the current feature is pretty much just a copy and paste of the F2P version of this game.In conclusion, as of now, the game is not very good, I only recommend it because I know that this game can be great, the developers are very active and are always listening to community feedback - now all they need to do is fix some bugs, add some content, and advertise.Current score: 5/10"

The non stop fast paced action packed close quarters gameplay is still there and I still enjoy it except for the problems listed below. The game is relatively easy to play and can be compared to COD, but like on steroids with caffeine and red bull. Half the time when you die, you don’t know what killed you, which is actually not that good cause all the weapons seem to do a little TOO MUCH damage. But nonetheless a great must get game.Now let's get to business. This game, like many other reviews have said, is a great game as far as early access games go, and it DOES have TONS of potential to grow as I am sure the Dev’s are working very hard to get the full game underway. You have probably seen many people say these things but why? Well the graphics are STUNNING compared to the F2P version. The weapons and characters are still a little fuzzy around the edges with the detail and everything but I am sure they will end up fine. The only problem is the vanguard still looks really stupid in my opinion but whatever.CONSThe thing is I know how everyone is saying, “Oh this is great! I get all of the classes and all of the weapons! Cause ya know, this game is all about SKILL now. Not, who can buy the best weapons!” That is only half true. In the F2P version, if you didn’t know, you could only rent weapons for a certain amount of time with in game money. But with real money, you could by kong creds and get them permanently. This, which I feel many F2P vets will agree with, was total bs, and I am very happy that they did not carry that onto the new steam game. However, they contradicted themselves by giving everyone every weapon. If you hadn’t noticed, the weapons in the mix, like the Hydra (Machine pistol or whatever) and the Interdiction (Sniper), were both LEGENDARY weapons in the F2P version, and SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED FOR EVERYONE TO USE. Instead of everyone having ALL of the weapons, they should bring back IN GAME CURRENCY and have everyone start out with a default weapons, and have to EARN their weapon. Cause I have played countless games with noobs just running around with the super OP bonebreaker and just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥everyone off. Bassically they just threw a smorgash borge of elite, standard, and legendary into a big weapons pile and said, “Here, use this, it's’ a one shot kill”. Things like the anaconda as well should be legendary. All of these weapons like the Chainsaw, if they bring it back with the tank, should be hard to get. Or at least take a while to get.Secondly they need to have everyone pick one class they want to default as, and have them have to save up to buy their next class. BRING BACK WEAPONS CASES AND EVENTS. WE NEED SKINS. I believe any F2P vet can agree at how exciting it was to open a case and be like, “Holy crap! Check out this sweet gun! OMG I CAN’t BELIEVE I GOT THIS”. These things need to be changed. And I must say that spawn points are jacked up in free for all. I’ll die and just spawn in the middle of a firefight and die before I can move.#HOPEAPLOTLINEISADDEDI also agree that the chat does interfere with gameplay cause i'll be fighting and hit T and then i'll try and move and i'll be typing a message and then before I know what I did I will die.I know I just totally trashed the game but this game is STILL GOOD and I recommend it to ANY player."

No. But for 6.99$ did you really expect as much? Now, I really would like to add more time to my review, but as it stands, there is one aspect that just makes playing matches too hard currently.The make or break issue for Ballistic, at least in my case, was the networking. This is the reason I decided to go negative. Ballistic Overkill has a lot in common with Call of Duty. In that it's relatively fast paced arena shooter and the time to kill can be relatively low. You can find yourself getting one shotted at point blank with a sniper or even a shotgun. Why is that relavent you may ask?There are no dedicated servers. You get a p2p connection with the host of the game. And there doesn't seem to be any lag compensation to make up for that fact like there is with the old Call of Duty games. What this means is in those moments where you meet someone around a corner and both of you are capable of killing each other almost instantly. The person with the better ping to the host will almost always win. You'll die putting buckshot into someone and end up not even getting a hit marker before you die. That puts a pretty large advantage on where the game host is located.Now, I personally haven't dealt with a p2p connection based shooter in half a decade, not unless you count Black Ops 2, which used a hybrid of p2p connections and listening servers. So I have to say I'm not sure whether that was my problem or not, but generally I experienced higher pings then what I'm used to in other games, like TF2 or CS:GO. Part of my problem is I just don't have enough information. Thankfully, the developers recently gave us the ability to see what general area the host is located in. But, the issue with this is that it's still too vague. You know you're playing with someone in North America or Europe now, you just don't know what state, province, or city they are located in. Do you live Kentucky? Good for you! The host could be living in Quebec for all you know. And if you're wondering where Quebec is, it's on the edge of the East coast of Canada. This is the reason I can't tell whether the game's networking coding is the problem for my generally higher ping, or if the hosts are located in more remote areas of North America then I am used too dealing with.In short, unless you plan to be the host every single time you're playing the game, prepare to lose some gunfights left and right, and not of your own accord either. And if you are host, you should also learn to accept your winning might be due to the crutch that is the latency advantage rather then the other guy just being a noob who likes standing there and eating your lead."

Shadow, basically a ninja with an SMG that cloaks when he runs, Grenadier, the only explosives class specializing in grenade launchers and hand grenades, Tank, the heavy class who's slow, but packs a large machine gun and a CQB rifle as a sidearm, and finally the Marksman, an all rounder class with the most average stats but has the largest minimap range and can be equipped with any kind of primary weapon. There are no support/healing classes as you can see, it's strictly all classes with different ways to get kills with different weapons, perks, and abilities.There are no Pay2Win aspects of the game, all you pay for is cosmetics, otherwise if you want new weapons for each class you have to play the respective classes to earn them. Though there is a crate and skins system, you do not have to pay money for keys to open the boxes or anything, you just get them and open them and there are accessories you can get with the right skins.Gamemodes are pretty standard: You have capture points, free for all, King of the Hill and team deathmatch as far as I can tell. And the game has a bunch of neat maps on it as well.All in all, I can't give the game a negative review as it's not particularly bad, but I will say do not expect too much; If you have at most $12 (I got it on sale half off) you wanna drop for a multiplayer shooter for the heck of it, then I'd say give this a try, it's not bad, but it's by no means anything special, it's just okay. It's definately fun though. 6/10"

As it progressed through 3.0 and 4.0, the game stayed amazing. Now, here we are, with the game on Steam, in Early Access, for just $7. How can you not buy it? Just $7. Compare that to the newest addition to the CoD franchise, Black Ops III, for $60. Now, lets look a bit further into it. CoD has been recycled over and over again, offering nothing new. Ballsitic Overkill is fresh, exciting and, most importantly, new. It is being rebuilt from the groud up, so you can expect some issues.Lag & Latency issues are the biggest thing that drive people away. But, you have to understand, the game is being completely redone. With each update, patch, and hotfix, the game gets better and better, being able to handle more than before. With each update, the lag is decreased, and will be gone soon.The game is updated almost once a week, or, maybe a little bit more spaced out than that.Right now, the game is at it's cores, so if you get Ballistic now, you can expect fresh and new things to do, from exploring new maps, using new classes, to creating fun game modes in your very own dedicated server.All in all, Ballistic is still an amazing game. Yes, you can expect a few small issues here and there. But nothing so major that it will effect your gaming experience.Get the game, and join us in combat!

No. However it isn't anything special either. It definitely doesn't look, play or sound anything like Overwatch. Fast paced? The last FPSs I've played in multiplayer were Overwatch and Titanfall 2. This game feels like an old grandpa compared to the two. The gameplay is OK but it's not fast paced. Your character can do a little jump like in the old CoDs, sprint and that's it. Overwatch lets you jump very high or teleport into hard to reach places. There's none of that in here. The only difference bewteen classes in this game are weapons (sniper, grenade launcher etc) and the amount of health given.There's nothing similar to Overwatch. It's not as fast paced as any of the old-school twitch shooters or even some of the latest titles as Titanfall 2 and it is not the best shooter on Steam. Definitely not.Looking at the this game reminds me of Dirty Bomb. However Dirty Bomb is free-2-play, more fast paced and has a more polished and a more fun gameplay...So go play that instead.This is not a bad game. The graphics are OK. The gameplay is OK and the idea itself is OK as well and the game knows it's worth. I'd say that it's well worth it's price but not a cent more and that speaks volumes about the game.It's not bad but why should I bother when I have Dirty Bomb, Call of Duty, Battlefield, Overwatch, Titanfall etc. It just doesn't compete with any of these games.Just an ""Okayish"" gameplay without bringing anything new to the table is not enough to pull us away from other shooters. Especially when said gameplay is a bit clunky and feels weird at times.It's not a bad game and I'd say it's worth a try especially now when you can get refunds. The only reason I felt the need to write all this is because of the blatant lies on the store page.""Fast paced"" ""Best shooter on Steam"" ""Like CoD and Overwatch had a child"" - Where the hell did they pull all these out from?"

Yet with every single update I have become more disgusted of this game. The recent update brought up this 'spectator mode' for instance, and the developers did not even do a thorough check before making it mandatory for every player to update their games--the spectator mode has bugs that are so obvious such as making an in-game player quit and force them to choose sides after playing for a while in a single match. Also, balance is totally destroyed with the addition of 'choosing side' function. It's a waste of resources to develop such a function in such a fast-pace game. Many more times have I seen one team in a game getting 5% of the points their opponents do, than I did in the previous version. I am HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED."

The classes are balanced as well making for an excelent fps. None of the classes are over powered it is purely about how you want to play. When you find a class you like you will get attatched and it will be hard to learn/play another class but at the same time it is well worth it to try out the other classes. Audio, visuals, mechanics, and controls are great I have found no issues so far with anything. I hope to see a party system in the future so you can party with friends but for now you can join the same game and most of the time you will be on the same team.

You don't need to pay for anything to open it. You can sell the box or the skins if you want. Also, when you have a certain amount of skins of a certain quality or season, you can craft an accessory. Each couple of month, the boxe's season changes for a new one and the old stop from dropping. You can buy ""DLC"" but they're only paid merc's skins (only skins, no gameplay changes) and some are free.CONs- They're not enough players depending on your timezone, and you can find some empty servers.- The netcode isn't that great and depending on what server you've connected to, you can get a pretty bad game because of ping.- Not a lot of maps or gamemodes atm but it will change as the game is still in devlopment."

You see it is not an AAA title. It is a FPS for people that cannot afford CoD IW or BO3.* it feels too much like a F2P shooter.* always same spawn point on a map.* truly some balance issues with the guns and that the guns do not fit to the map.* I though I felt an aimbot on one of the weapons...""?""What I like:* decent graphics.* okay weapons.* size and theme of the maps is good.* exp / level-up system.* good connection.* server browser.Buy it if you can't afford Call of Duty.

I knew it was early, but not THAT early, you could at least add some space-fillers.I liked the idea of the South America servers, even though they are a bit empty.I feel like the game is more balanced than it used to be, with less snipers-one-shot-ruining-the-fun thing.I like the new talent treeI am not sure if I like not having levels and unlockables anymore, still need to think about itAs it early and the old game got deleted, the servers feel very emptySometimes, some players feel like cheating or being much better than others, winning the game aloneThere seems to be no more Vote Kick, which is both good and bad.Well, I play this game since on Kongregate, and didn't expect it to come back to be honest. But I still miss the great old days, even though I'm scared with how it's redevelopment will go, so here are some of the most important compiled tips I could think of:1: NO PAY-TO-WIN. PLEASE. - now that it's on steam, everybody paid, so everybody should win. Don't abuse in-game purchases.2: Reward early acess/F2P players properly - AFAIK, we did not just gave you money, we also lost everything we had on K, Facebook, etc at F2P: accounts, weapons... And the game itself. Make sure to properly award people[people who used to play it before steam] who still invest into and love this game after all.3: No hackers. Seriously, make it at least 99% hacker safe this time, it used to ruin the fun. Don't let it happen again.4: The 3 tips above are essential in my opinion. Anything else is tolerable, bugs, gameplay... I just hope it gets at least as good as it used to be and we can go through the obstacles, unless you f**k up one of the above items (no offense, talking for myself)."

I've spent £5 and I've been thrown in with a pile of people who have been playing this game considerably longer than me (avg level 10) and I've come out with the third highest score. My team lost but it was a thrilling ride. This has happened a few times today and I think it's luring me into being more boastful about my skill that it probably warrants. But again, that's probably a good thing. I'm enjoying it.What I don't enjoy is how precariously the future of this game balances on paid junk. Thereareunlocks but these  seem to be progression and luck based. I've no interest in playing a game where pay-to-win starts creeping in as it has so many other first-person shooters.Another downer is what happens when a team manages to dominate. I'm not saying it's always unfair but I was in a 2vs5 situation for most of a game and just getting out of spawn was tough. Could certainly cause a rage-quit or two.Oh and it'd be nice to play locally against bots. A class-based tutorial might not hurt for new users too."

This results in a lot of spawn camping.- The game modes are basic and can hardly be housed in the small maps, resulting in gameplay that pretty much devolves into bum rushing a point over and over with very little tactics involved.- The grenades get thrown with zero trajectory, meaning your years of aim and practice are thrown out the window.- The classes are unbalanced, and the game holds your hand in automatically activating abilities.Do not buy this game.

Spawn camping is the standard for almost every game.-Awful weapons. Small mag size, high rate of fire, and low damage mean if you miss any you are going to find yourself constantly dying while reloading. There is very low potential to take on multiple enemies. Maybe the guns at higher level are better, but I can't force myself to grind for them.-Ninjas with swords that are also bullet sponges. Miss any shots on that guy running around a corner at you with a katana and you are going to die while reloading.-Tiny health packs. If you take any damage you might as well just forget winning another gunfight. No health regen on most characters and the health packs are tiny. Oh and you don't even regen health in spawn. If you're lucky, there's a large health in there, but it's different on every map.-ADS sensitivity is garbage. It seems different for each gun.-The game is full of players that are absolute garbage or sweaty and play this game religiously. Because of the small mag size, no health regen, and tiny health packs it's very hard to stay alive long enough to hold control points/objectives, therefore you can't carry the bad players on your team.-Leveling up is a pain because some of the weapons are complete trash.This game looked like a lot of fun but just doesn't cut it. Go play black ops 2. Better weapons and map design, better hit registration, overall more enjoyable experience. And that's even with the occasional camper using an LMG with target finder.

I don't know if its because it's not pay to win or if everyone is just blind to see the obvious issues this game has.First of all, the game itself is nothing special, but it's alright. However it has 2 main issues.1. The maps. The maps in this game suck♥♥♥♥♥ They are all way too open so that you are never safe from snipers on the other side of the map. The best example for this is Sunsquare mall. There is a huge open area that you can control with just one Wraith (sniper class). In King Of The Hill the capture point is located right in the middle of this part of the map. It's my least favorite map. Also there is not enough variety in the maps. They all follow the same principle (except nox museum maybe) and the developer needs to add more new refreshing maps.2. The classes. There are 2 obviously overpowered classes in this game. The Tank and especially the Shadow. The tank is a tanky unit that has heavy machine guns, which would be fine, IF YOU COULDN'T ACCURATELY SHOOT SOMEBODY ACCURATELY IN THE HEAD ACROSS THE MAP. In my opinion the accuracies of all weapons should get nerfed. This is made worse by the fact that you cant one-hit him with most rifles (only if you hit the head) so that he has enough time to kill you without counterplay.The second class thats overpowered is the Shadow. He gets invisible WHILE RUNNING (INSTANTLY), he uses light machine guns that have way too high accuracies and if you spot him youre dead. In most games when I start using this class everyone else switches to Shadow as well out of frustration. Then it stops being fun for everyone.Good game bad balance 6.5/10"

,Not Recommended,296300,22101723,"Posted: 28 March, 2016",all,SourSalsa,"As a big fan of what Ballistic originally was, it pains me to give this game a negative review.When the game was on Kongregate just as Ballistic, it was so much better. A F2P FPS with pretty good graphics for a browser game, lockboxes (crates for weapons), multiple events for special lockboxes, a ton of classes to level up, so many weapons! It was amazing! I played the game for a long time, levelling up my classes, opening lockboxes, participating in the various events, unboxing those lockboxes. There was a little bit of character customization too, just some little hats or miscs that you could put on from Holiday Events. The game was so ALIVE! I would get in a party with my friend and find a match instantly no matter what time of the day it was. Ballistic was more than I ever expected when it came to a Browser-Based, Free2Play FPS game.Unfortunately, Ballistic Overkill is NOT Ballistic. Before I get into why, let's start with the Pros. Ballistic Overkill still has the good graphics that were in Ballistic, possibly even better. The game has all the classes from the original Ballistic and you can still level them up. They've also kept old maps from the original game. Gameplay feels like it used to. It hasn't changed a bit. The way you play the game now is the way the game was played before it came to Steam.Now, let's go to the Cons. Lockboxes are gone. There is no way to play the game and earn any type of lockbox. Special lockboxes, mostly event ones, would give you the same gun you can buy in the store but with boots and/or camos to the guns. Not to mention, you didn't even have to buy the lockboxes if you didn't want to. You could just play the game and over time you'd earn enough points for them to unlock for you right after the game. The game eliminated the idea of being F2P, but did they really have to get rid of the idea of lockboxes for boosts or skins or anything like that? I mean, it'd still be cool to have a way to personalize your gun through them. Rather than lockboxes, all the guns are already given to you. Seriously? There's no feeling of a grind to unlock a gun you want? There's no sense of achievement after doing so? (Not to mention that not all of the guns from Ballistic are in Ballistic Overkill!) Everything is already given to you. It's like you've already beaten the game just by buying it and pressing play. It gets so boring after a while because once you use all the weapons, there's nothing more to the game. That's it. Also, where the heck are the servers? This game was always so alive when it was on Kongregate. Now I open the game and I see about 3-4 servers. If I'm lucky, 5. Most of these servers don't even have good connection. After seeing multiple red 1 bar connections on almost all the servers, there's that 1 server that either has a 3 bar or the lucky, green 4 bar connection. Even if the connection is good, sometimes it still won't join. I click cancel and try again, but no luck. After a bit of time I click cancel again, and then the cancel button doesn't work. Cancel. Cancel. CANCEL! It doesn't cancel. Then I have to restart the game. That's just annoying.Ballistic Overkill is far from the original Ballistic. Sure, the gameplay is the same, it has the same maps, it has same classes, it has SOME of the same weapons, but does it add anything new? Is the game better in any way? No. Not at all. In fact, it takes away things that made the old game so much fun. Lockboxes, weapons, events, especially players and servers. It just makes the game worse. It's so boring to play. The original Ballistic was so much fun! I loved it! I don't hate this game, but I definitley don't like it. I don't want to hate this game! This game either needs to go back to its old self, or it at least needs to add back everything that made Ballistic what it was. This game is really nothing special or unique now. It's just anothe average shooter that you could easily find on a browser.The cons easily overweigh the pros, I do not recommend this game to anyone."

This is the games fault, not the players fault. Why would you choose something else if this is the better class?I like to see variety in my games, and this game doesn't seem have it.The type of classes seem to be mismatched for the kind of level design it has, you have tactical classes like the few assault rifle characters, but there is hundreds of corners and angles to check, which then removes the point of having tactics and strategy, you have a better chance of getting kills running around mindlessly.There is 7-8 classes (I guess?), but they are all played the same way.This could be one of your just shoot around mindlessly to kill time game, but this isn't my cup of tea.4.5/10TL:DREveryone plays the same classMap design doesn't match the mechanicsToo much like CoDRefunded"
,Not Recommended,296300,30880033,Posted: 1 April,all,Rowan,"SCORE: 6/10Ballistic Overkill seems like it would be a great title, offering various elements that other popular games also offer: fast-paced PVP content, 7 different classes each with their own skills and weapons, Loadouts and various different maps and game modes.However, there are certain elements to Ballistic Overkill that just simply makes it a 'bad' game. The game has a low player count, making it hard to find games on certain modes. On top of that, there is a lack of team balancing, meaning you will be placed in matches against high-level players so one team has a clear advantage. There is also a high focus on grinding the game, rewarding the players with uninspired, worthless skins. This fact makes it feel like more of a time-waster than an enjoyable game.On the contrary, I cannot bash the fact that the game does feel smooth. It's like a mix between Overwatch and Call of Duty, offering consistent and smooth FPS and performance.Overall, it's good but it's not quite Carling. Play something more 'polished'. Dirty Bomb, for example."

Gun play, always a concern for FPS, feels really good -- similar to howDirty Bomb played at release before they messed up the gun play months after. Dirty Bomb might have switched it back, but I quit the game, as did many, after they made that change.Here is what I initially said about Dirty Bomb, and I think it applies to Ballistic Overkill: Think Counter-Strike (gun play) meets Team Fortress 2 (objectives) meets Call of Duty (fast pace)... on steroids. A variety of weapons, great gun play mechanics and smooth movement meets team objectives/goals.It's an alpha, so there are some minor bugs here and there, and perhaps some slight balancing needed (definitely not as much as others would like to whine about, but then again, I have played *a lot* of FPS games).  But to be honest, it plays pretty great, all things considering.  Factor in the relatively low price, and you get a lot of value.Super fun, simple/straight-forward, fast-paced shooter game that is easy to pick up... and I would recommended it highly... BUT, increasingly, I find servers filled with people who are either of extremely different latency (making them hard to hit) or hacking (youtube for the hacks -- and you don't have to have an aimbot on to get a big advantage if you're a somewhat experienced FPS player -- even something as a slight speed movement boost or recoil reduction is enough to make it ).  These are amplified because of the fast pace and quick TTK.If I'm not mistaken, this runs on the Unity Engine, which is what Rust is also based on.  Read the issues that Rust has had on latency and hacking issues during it's development.Anyhow, I'll change my recommendation to Very Positive should I see more usage of latency limiters as well as a ban wave of hackers.  I'll still play the game once in a while because it is fun. But as popularity grows, so will the latency and hacking issues."

My one complaint is about the ninja charecter, whatever his name is. He is very unbalanced, and by far the most fun charecter to play as. This means that far too often you face a team with maybe 3 of these guys. I'd recomend going in the same direction as Overwatch(Which this game is clearly capitalizing on)and allowing only one of each charecter per team. Another thing to help rebalance would be to give the other charecters cool abilities too. I like the on demand fast cloak♥♥♥♥♥♥the ninja has, and if every charecter had a unique unlimited use ability like that this game could really be something special. Other than that, It's a lot of fun. I'd reccomend buying in.UPDATE 1:After another hour or so of play I have one more thing to say, holy mother of hackers. When I say this game is infested with hackers, I don't mean that sometimes people pull off bs shots. Almost every game I play has at least one. In just an hour and a half of playing I've encountered people flying, teleporting, enemies appearing to be on the friendly team, enemies inside of our blocked off spawn, and enemies who don't take damage. Because of this I'm going to have to change my review to negative and ask for a refund. Let me know when you find a way to stop hackers."

But what made this go downhill for me was the Shadow class and damage dealt by each weapon. The Shadow class allows to to sprint faster than other classes, but the worst part is the invisibility. Every 10 or so seconds,  the shadow will leave behind a clone that stays for a good second making you look like a dumbass shooting into thin air when it disappears. Now for the damage. For snipers, it is a one hit kill no matter where they hit you. Head, body, arm, leg , or even the foot, it is a one shot. Because snipers also one hit kill, people spawn camp with them which leaves a frustrating feeling. For pistols, their damage could be a little higher but overall they are fine. Now for rifles, they do decent damage, but some of them do little to no damage leaving you with an empty clip after you kill someone. One last problem I forgot to mention was how empty the servers were."

There are just a few things that need to be added to make this the complete package though. First, please add microtransactions, the loot system is so wierd, you first have to wait 48 hours and then play 2 more hours to unlock ONE!!! This is far too little. After 15 hours of play, I only have one skin that is worth my use, and THREE boxes overall. I know that this system is in place to prevent a box exploit but this is a bit extreme. I would gladly spend money on boxes. If they were to add these, they could add some sort of warning that tells you that the items are not ""game-changing."" Lastly, there should be a kill cam. After every death there should be a video of the enemies screen showing how you died. I like the anti-hacking system they have in place, but it would be much better to know if your report was deserved or not. Also I just want to see what I did wrong sometimes.

This game is a huge f**k you to anyone with remotley bad aim. You need an entire clip to kill just about any class2. Invisable Ninja. Whoever thought of this and made it. You're a terrible human being3. Lockboxes (The only thing i kept playing for) can only be received once every 48 hours. Dumb AF4. Bullet damage is late and that affects me alot. Ill shoot somebody watch the gun shoot and watch the bullets go throught the enemy and they take no damage then I die.How to make this game amazing:1. Health always 100 (Except for tank, maybe 150) takes too long to kill and in the end only helps people who are good at aiming.2. Shadow needs to go. Sorry if you like him but he ruins all the fun. One hit kills while always invisable with little clones to throw someone off even more than being invisable.3. Damage needs to be instant not a little after4. Damage Per Bullet needs to be Damage Per Second. If per bullet by shotgun dopes 298 then one hit kills should occur 90% of the time (They dont)5. If a knife can kill you instantly with 200 health then all shotguns and guns should be able to kill in 1 sec max6. Damage drop off needs to be lowered. I can stand not being able to kill somebody just because they are an extra foot away because of this.I dont understand how so many people can give this game a good review. For an Early Access game its very stable in terms of glitches. But this game is not good and the only people who will be playing this are elitists."

When you use a setting lower than than 0.25 (i had to use 400dpi and 0.15 ingame sense to achieve my desired sensitivity) and move the mouse slowly the game doesn't register your mouse input. I was able to move my mouse across the whole mousepad slow enough, so my crosshair ingame would not move at all.As a low sensitivity gamer this issue makes the game unplayable for me. Anyone playing on low sensitivity coming from cs, bf and so on and is used to raw flawless mouse input.  Be warned.This issue is 100% not related to my system , since i was able to replicate the issue on 2 different systems with different mice and operating systems/hardware.I hope that the developers will fix it in the future.Other than that the game seems solid and comparable to Brink and Dirty Bomb.

The only two really redeeming qualities of this game are that it looks 'okay' graphically speaking and it's cheap. Honestly the only thing that would've prevented me from refunding this game, was if there were any cute female characters to play (because yes, I'm 'that' guy.), but no, there's not even that. Of course I can't in all good faith count that as an objective reason against the game, but for me it's a deal breaker.Bottom line, personal reasons aside, I do not think this game is worth the time or money, buuut that isn't to say I don't think it 'ever' will be.

Think of it like Dirty Bomb except it isn't pay to win garbage.
,Recommended,296300,30545568,Posted: 16 March,all,Blitzkraken,"I got this game on a whim. I was browsing the ""shooter"" tag and stumbled upon this, and being priced at only $6.99 I figured I'd give it a chance. After playing it for a while, I'm actually surprised it's not priced a bit higher (for comparison, a TF2 taunt is around $10-12). Sure, it may have a few bugs, and a few weapons need balancing, but it's a steal at it's current price (or at least to me it is!). The servers are almost always full. I've played at pretty much any point of the day and could always find a match. (US, west)The class system is pretty interesting. Each character has unique weapons that only they can use, yet there's a lot of overlap of what types they have as well. Each of them have access to SMGs, assault rifles, pistols, etc. So you can adjust their loadouts to suit your playstyle. There is no primary and secondary restrictions. If you want two rifles or grenade launchers, go for it! Just be aware that certain weapons are better in some locations.From what I can tell, all of the maps support each gamemode. I also like how each location has a distinct layout and doesn't reuse assets between levels. Some games feel like they are based in one location, so I'm always glad to find some that try to keep things visually interesting.It has a drop system that doesn't require keys, and a scrap system for getting rid of duplicates (it's early access, so save the skins instead). You can even sell and buy items on the market, which is always a nice feature.As with any online game, ping is important. While *I* don't have the best connection in the world, it plays really well. I don't notice any rubber-banding or stuttering at my average ping of 150-380. I've had it hit 700 ping a couple of times on bad days, and besides missing most of my shots or being hit from behind cover, it still felt smooth to play instead of turning into a stuttery mess.(see edit)For performance, I'd say it's pretty well optimized. I play on a low-end laptop with all low settings and my framerate usually stays around 25-50 depending on the location. Explosions/Particles aren't a problem, since I haven't seen a huge lag spike from entering a chaotic battle. I don't even feel it affecting my controls or anything when it drops down either. If you can run Half-life 2 or Team Fortress 2, then it's probably a good chance you can run this just fine.More graphical options would be nice (currently there's only a global option with, low, medium, and high). Usually I'd only turn off shaders and shadows to make a game run better, while maintaining a higher texture quality. (specs on my profile, haha)Overall it's a great fast-paced game that I'd recommend, and it's one that I'll probably continue to play. It's a really good price for what it is!EDIT:While nobody complained about my connection before release, it seemed like quite a few people started to complain in-chat about me lagging (jumpy movement, etc) after the game left early-access. I didn't notice any of this while playing from my end, but apparently it's very noticable to other players.

Right out of spawn areas will then have barriers and walls making them easy to camp, complete with health drops, and cause a blowout.Blow outs - The game has no player skill balancing,  resulting in nearly every match being a blow out where two lvl. 40s camping enemy spawn destroy the team of lvl. 2s. There is also no ranked playlist for these better players to go.Balance - The community has willed that about 3 of the 7 classes are the only viable ones so you are often playing against and with teams of only snipers, assassins, and grenadeirs. Whether or not these classes are overpowered isn't really the problem, it's just that the community will overwhelmingly pick these classes.Servers - You will often take damage from places that you were standing a while ago, could be a hitbox or latency issue.Pros:There are plenty of pros, but none of them are really all their own.

I also played in F2P.It doesnt look bad at first sight, but there are big issues that stop this game from being good and having any potential as an competive game. The damage system is the biggest issue.- It can take you more than 4 headshots to kill enemys, with assault rifles form close range. No onetaps, ever.- Most boltaction sniper rifles cannot kill the average class in one shot. What is boltaction for then???- So boltaction and rifles take ages to kill with, while there are GRENADE LAUNCHERS and SWORDS, yes SWORDS that are really OVERPOWERD and super easy to use.- Look at the killfeed in any random game, most guys are killed with bodyshots, people just spray and pray. And you cannot blame them. It is an result of how the damage system was setup. If guns had more damage, and more recoil, maybe people would aim before they shoot. If you want a good KD just run and spray it always works in this game, no skill needed.- I suggest you play:-CSGO- WARFACE(but warface is on a road to P2W so it is still good but it will get ♥♥♥♥ed over)"

I always thought it looked cool, but after playing it for just 30 minutes I now completely understand why it has 500 players. The balancing in the game is completely off, each character has different passive abilities, and only one class gets played- Ninja. Why? Well their ability is for them to ghost around passively, over and over again, no cooldown what so ever and they have akimbo glocks that offer no recoil at all, they just absolutely melt people. They only have 150 health though, so I thought I'd grab a shotty and kill them and nope! 3 shots to the chest close range wouldn't even kill them (worst than H1Z1). I then played a tank class that uses a M240 LMG and it was the weakest gun of all the class. I really feel like they just made classes and weapons without any sort of balancing going into it, they just put random numbers for each weapon. Just avoid this game."

,Recommended,296300,22950884,"Posted: 13 May, 2016",all,~gLITCH-^,"~Please upvote the review if you found it helpful, thanks~Having played the game for a while and seeing the progress it has made within the past year, I figured I would give a review.-I'll add more to this review when I remember things or encounter new problems.Oh, and my hours aren't accurate, have only about 200-250, accidently left it running for a while.Pros-Movement-There is a type of bunnyhopping (you move faster after jumping than when you are sprinting)-If you are good at movement and know your maps, there are ways to navigate the maps faster, and without receiving fall damage. Basically, there's a lot of cool parkour that's possible.Character customization- You can choose two skills per loadout, allowing you to customize and fine-tune the class to a specific playstyle.Customization (visual)A couple hundred skins, when you get a collection of certain skins you unlock vanity items. Can attain skins for free by opening lockboxes you earn by playing, or by purchasing skins/lockboxes on the steam market.UIAesthetically and functionally, the menus are great. Simple, good looking, easy to navigate.Not P2W whatsoever. Guns can only be unlocked by playing the game and earning experience. All classes are unlocked from the start.Low learning curveMight be somewhat biased as I played the browser version, but being good at the game is 90% aim, combined with basic movement skills and game sense. Any good FPS player can pick this up quite quickly.BalanceIt is quite possible to be successful in this game with any class or weapon. All classes have their pros and cons, and the same goes for the weapons. There are a few exceptions of minor imblanaces (supernova with the right perks), but there is no class or weapon that is significantly better than the rest. And people who complain saying shadow is OP are just bad players, mad that they are not good at the game. Simple as that.Cons-Lack of basic features-Very few graphics settings. 3 presets (low, med, high) and 4 additional options (AA, V-sync, motion blur, fullscreen)-No competitve mode/ranking system/leaderboards-No 1st person spectating, impossible to tell if someone is hacking unless it is obvious (e.g. getting killed by someone in their own spawn)Not enough to do (esp. with players that have unlocked everything)Once you get all your classes to max, there is really nothing to do except trying to improve your stats, going for insane scores, or attaining skins.Optimization/Technical ProblemsFirstly, the game's performance seems to be completely different for players with similar specs. Some claim the game is perfectly optimized, with consistent high framerates, while others have a multitude of problems. I'm one of the people with that multitude of problems, despite having a powerful PC (i7 4790k, gtx 970, 8 gigs of ram).1. When I start up the game, it often crashes. At the very least, I am greeted by a black screen and the damned spinning blue circle. Takes at minimum 30 seconds to get to the opening screen.2. The first time spawning, my game freezes for about ~20 seconds.3. When killing an enemy, the game often freezes for a couple seconds.4. Random freezing while playing, can be anywhere up to 20 seconds (some have speculated the freeze starts when someone spawns)5. Framerates are significantly lower in matches with more players. On a typical 12 man game I am over 150 FPS on low settings for most of the time. On a 16 man match with the same settings, my PC struggles to even hit 100, often dropping below 60.6. The framerate difference between low and medium is insane, (cutting my framerate in half in some cases), while the difference between medium and high is basically unnoticeable (both with framerate and graphics)Bugs/Glitches/other problems that happen frequently1. When loading into a match, the loading bar is 100% complete but you never load into the game2. no servers will show up in the server browser.3. When respawning, all you get is a spectate screen overlayed with your HUD. You can't do anything about it except leave the match.4. incorrect ""can't join game"" messages. When joining a game that's not full, you often get nothing but ""error joining game"" or ""server is full"" Often can't do anything about this except restart the game.5. A bunch of stuff that I can't remember off the top of my head, will add later.Spawn SystemThe game's spawn system is simply flawed. Spawn camping is inevitable in every match. When the match has unbalanced teams, the problem gets even worse. In addition, the spawn system promotes horrible playstyles, particularly in TDM. Players can camp at the edge of their spawn wall for the entire match, peeking a couple times when they find an easy target, and go positive (therefore benifiting their team) that way. This makes map control useless, and even when a team is seemingly dominating the other, it can lose.Low player countSimply put, not enough people play the game to make every type of match playable. If you want to play a certain map, you have to wait until there is a match available on that map. Want to play a certain gamemode? You have to wait for that too. As someone who loves FFA, I often for hours in-game without playing or seeing a single FFA game in the server browser.(Neither a pro or con)- devsThe developer's decisions are questionable at the least- Prioritizing female character skins above a competitive mode, better netcode, and something as simple as making sensitivity customization useful mystifies me. However, the devs are some of the most interactive I have seen. Simply making a suggestion in the discord server often recieves a response."

Sometimes you get spawn capmed for the rest of the round, rounds randomly end (like the enamy team is at 854 out of 1000 points and then the game just ends) Oh and there is a map where if you can get a sinper up on the rail, he can spawn kill the team, and his team is now garanted to win because no other weapon is acurate enough exsept his own. And the characters are lazy, are the dialog for them feels like I'm playing paladens.Don't get this game, it has a simaler marketing to CS:GO with it's skins, but hey at least CS:GO was a good game.

Something you would expect in Goldeneye for N64.  Most games consist of you getting back stabbed by a swarm of invisible ninja characters named Shadow.  You kill one and get killed by another that was flanking.  It's a constant swarm of them.  They run straight to you jumping around so they can one shot you in melee.  It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ really.  If you ever get into an exchange with someone across the map you can pretty much guarantee yourself getting backstabbed in the next few moments.  Almost every game I played the top player was a Shadow with some 3:1 K/D ratio and all they did was tunnel vision melee around the map.  Real skillful huh?  The only fun I had was the maps that had tons of corridors so Shadow players weren't OP.  Most maps felt very open though.  Ever play MW2 when it came out and everyone just ran as commando and knifed everyone or boomsticked until they patched it?  Yeah it's like that except this time you can't see them coming.

This looks more like a copy cat rather than a port from one platform to another. The Game suffers of a lot of desync and lag, even in low lag servers. I see players hanging and running in place, the resuming movement, same as I freeze and the game continues after a while.  Lots of Disconnections and poor Server Quality. Floating and Flying players are still around. There is a lot of ""Bot Like GamePlay"", let me explain this one.Bot Like GamePlay : You are running into a room and before you get there someone shows up and kills you in one second, no hit aura around your HUD.You are in a wider area and suddently someone shows up and kills you in less than a second. You wonder and think its some kind of bot that plays the game as a real player since their reaction and aim time is less than half second, not human like.Face-To-Face melee doesn't works as it used to do, the knife barely does anything, the blades are crap too, you can go head to head with someone in front of you and even with less than 50ms of lag in a local server you still don't hit them.Spawning in your base is not safe since there is someone always around, like your teammates don't see all the enemies around in the game. Weapons seems to drain too much HP, except when you are using them, headshoot (?) always try to aim high. Shotguns are SLOW and useless, there is no real dynamic on using them unless you have speed and can get close enough to use them.Strongboxes (?) One everytime the game feels like it.Guns (?) They seem to have picked up the worst ones.Game Mechanics (?) Worst game mechanics for an FPS, its one of those FPS that you will die a lot and never stay alive enough to enjoy holding your ground with your teammates, otherwise check the end results of each match. In Facebook there used to be huge matches, lots of action and fun, the need of going back to base to refill was way better than this medkit, infinite ammo and grenade spawning s... thing.Compared to a REAL FPS, this game lacks the spark to make it fun, its a bad version for now of the Facebook port, but luckly they will come with the rest of it, even the...SKILL TREE (?) Its no there, instead you get 2 skills per character, maybe this was the key for the game to be fun.This port feels like it was taken from someone else's ideas, and the original developers are not here to help them, in FB we had a lot of fun, in here im having a lot of frustration.What happened with the people that payed for PREM guns in FB when they got it out of there  (?)  No idea.Game keeps crashing a lot when loading the server list, it just dies and kills the app.I hate this game, I get killed by people that should be far away around the corner, even if I run into the fridge, the basement, turn around the planet, they still get me... WTF...Anti-Cheat my♥♥♥♥♥ I still see hackers around. And Strongboxes aren't daily ? They are given whenever the game feels like it to give them away plus other glitches, texture missing and bugs on a final product xD Amazing!!!!!!!""I was already around the corner and saw no one"", walked a few steps forward and then BANG! dead from behind. ""But I already check it out and there was NO ONE THERE!!!""< 100 ms ping = Desync Lag. They hit you when you are not even in their sight. The other way around > 150 ms ping = InstaWin, you hit them and they don't even know you have done a HUGE amount of damage. Grenades HIT DETECTION is lame and works when it feels like it.Nice idea to have a sniper with a laser that reveals your position... very clever honestly.2 out of 8 people found this useful ? Really ? Damn.. no wonder why servers are always empty and those empty ones are just fake, you can't join them, they are there for decoration. This game is crap, is not worth buying and all the promises from the developers are long gone... totally crap.There is new stuff to be described : People can hack in here, there is no Anti-Hack feature, you will see some curious aiming, how people always know where you are spawning, some glitches can also make the enemy go into the safe areas, other maps can be as glitchy that you can die inside your base by grenades when they are thrown with pinpoint accuracy (WallHack) into you and kill you instantly wondering how the ♥♥♥♥ you have died. Some players have the ability (SOME HACKERS) to move faster than you, strafing like Neo in The Matrix, evading everything, even running into your dual or single grenades and not getting hit (HIT DETECTION or GOD MODE?). I have so much to tell you about this game, if you want to enjoy playing ballistic then remember the old times when this game was good, if you want to have your balls handed over to you trying to play a broken, unstable and unplayable game buy it, you will just be feeding the needs of a bunch of developers that can't make proper games. I try to get the ♥♥♥♥ing reward box every day and its not showing up, every 48 hours NOTHING, its been 72 hours and I still don't get that stupid strongbox ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t for my collection, developers just want you to keep playing their crap, its up to you to choose if you will feed them or not...

,Recommended,296300,30832058,Posted: 30 March,all,WTFisBeyond_,"If you're looking for an alternative to Call of Duty, this is probably your best bet. Some classes have HP regen, but all the others need to hunt for health packs to restore health. The game is fast paced (if your lobby is full), and the guns feel good. The majority of the maps are designed very well; there is one or two that could be considered just ""hallway"" maps, but i personally like the design of most of them, they have a good flow, good cover spots for those of you that like to do that, and they have sections that are better for long range or cqc. There are some glaring balance issues as of writing this, such as the invis class' sword, and some of the shotguns for the Berserker class. The loot boxes that provide you skins are earned too slow, imo. You get 1 box every 48 hours, but you have to play for 2 hours straight (min) to get it after the 48 hours pass.  Overall, i really enjoy this game."

I bought it right away, i had the money weeks before the game came to steam just saving and waiting to get to buy it. And now, i understood that the game was still in progress and there was alot to come. My reviews and part-taking with the community has made many changes in this game, but im just getting tired of this. I still love this game, but its too much work to really have fun around here. This game just doesnt have enough supporters, i've talked with around 100+ people to check out this game and i have told about it everywhere. But nothing has happened. I open Ballistic and check the browser, noone is there. I am NOT giving up on this game. I am just not going to try and affect the community nor be active with the game. And for the developers, you are making the greatest game ever, DONT GIVE UP! And also, i cant play the game because when i start it, the hud doesnt load in and i cant go to settings, server browser, characters etc.Enjoy!Don't have many hours on the game but just enough to write this Review about the game, first off i want to say that this game has some unbalancing issues that makes that gamealmostunplayable, but the developers are really working on the game and its good that they can show us what they are doing, they are posting their progress in multiple ways. They are fixing bugs and balancing things, as long as YOU tell them whats wrong, without saying the game sucks and no1 likes it and that you are going to uninstall.Buy this game? Yes! Do it!Why? This game has ALOT of potentiall and there is alot to come, if you care and are kind enough you will buy the game now and test it, then you will inform the developers of whats wrong on their steam group/s or then you can wait for it to be done (will take some time though) and buy it then, but buy it! This game is amazing and its getting better.I know i kind of said the same thing over and over again but this is all you need to know! They are going to add alot of things and i know it!BUT DONT LET THEM ADD ANYTHING BEFORE BALANCING EVERYTHING SO ITS PERFECTLY SYNCED, YES I TOLD YOU TO NOT LET THEM DO IT! WE ALL NEED TO TELL THEM WHATS WRONG SO THEY KNOW WHAT TO FIX! THE COMMUNITY IS PRETTY BAD ATM BECAUSE EVERYONE IS COMPLAINING BUT NO1 IS DOING♥♥♥♥♥♥ABOUT IT!I have subscribed to all the discussions talking about bugs and new updates and balancing and ive seen that there is NO ONE who has said that ""Hey Developers! You should probably fix the Vanguards heavy weapons because they are unbalanced, the other weapons arent doing alot of damage, so maybe you could fix it?"" or then ""Developers, the Wraith is ridiculously overpowered and its game breaking, could you reduce the Wraiths protection and decrease accuracy when zoomed out? Thank you!""But instead what they say is ""This game sucks! The grenadier should be a counter for the sniper but it sucks! i shot a vanguard with the Destroyer 3 times in the chest and then he killed me and he had 50% health left! This patch made the game so bad im uninstalling!"" And yes i actually saw this comment.But please read this comment twice if you are not from the bright side. The bad thing in this game is the COMMUNITY! The game itself is NOT BAD."

I haven't had this much fun in an fps in several years!"
,Recommended,296300,30844854,Posted: 30 March,all,Uni S. Cornelius,"I've played this game durning early access and let me say I throughly enjoyed with only a few hiccups. Now that it's officially launched, I do have a few complaints.First and foremost, the net code is horrible. The game will play fine if you have a ping under 100 which is possible if you live in Europe, Central US or West Coast but if you live in the East Coast or Australia, you will have problems either because the internet connection is bad or there are no nearby servers. This game doesn't handle lag like most other games. Instead, it appears the game just tries to stay synced rather than skip and stutter. This causes problems because of how hitboxes will misalign with the model.Second, the balance in the game is pretty horrendous at times. Or it used to be. The balance has gotten MUCH better since launch with a certain class getting a much needed nerf and a few classes getting a nice little buff. However, there still exists a few problems. Many pistols act more like SMGs yet have a much higher headshot multiplier and not as much recoil. Dual wield weapons reign supreme in this game as well because they are incredibly easy to spam and get kills. This problem becomes worse when applied to a class like Shadow who is only needs to hit an enemy with 5 or 6 bullets to kill a tank with his dual wield SMGs/pistols.However, looking past these outstanding issues, you have a pretty polished game and is really good at feeling like a class based arena shooter. The gunplay is very nice however, many guns don't feel they have the kick that they should but I digress. Sound design is incredibly, except for some of the voice actors. The Tank, Wraith, and Grenadier all have pretty good voice actors. Then you have the female Shadow, Berserker, and Marksman who sound as if they are trying a little to hard to sound cool. The music is fantastic. The ambient music that plays in most maps is really soothing and has a nice contrast to the fast paced action and the title screen/main menu music has a nice futuristic tone and is just a great way to open the game. I partically love the future aesthetic that the game tries to capture with the map design.Ballistic Overkill is a really good game with huge glaring issues that would most likely be fixed in due time with future patches and updates. As much as I would say it is a great game though, it's just above the bar of average and fixing these issues would make it a good game."

,Recommended,296300,29266758,Posted: 14 January,all,Matoro Zeliph,"Back when it was in early access, I did not recommend the game [because it was buggy and unbalanced (to be expected)]. I didn't touch the game since then.It seems In the past couple months it seems they really listened to players feedback and adjusted the balance issues. At its final release, I have to say it's a FUN and BALANCED multiplayer FPS game!Here is my SUMMARY BELOW:Pros:- Each class can fit to your accustomed playstyle. The time to kill is about right.You like bunny hopping? Pick the Shadow.Are you an average joe CoD player? Pick the Vangaurd.Do you like quick scoping? Pick the WrathAre you slow, but great a support? Pick the Tank.- The gameplay feels unique than other ""boots on the ground FPSs"", since it feels like an old school fast paced shooter but has modern elements to it.- IT RUNS ON LINUX!!!! YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Cons:- Can't pick up weapons from your opponents, even if they're the same class as you. They don't favor scavenger players (like me :P ). Maybe they'll add that...please?- You have to ""grind"" to get weapon camos. Fortunately they don't ruin the balance of the game. It's just cosmetics.- Newly added voice acting is...poor and it gets muffled in the background. It is better than nothing, since it gives each of the characters personality.Suggestions:- Some objective based game modes aren't played as often as I would have hoped. Everyone plays freakin TDM 24/7!It would be nice if there would be a incentive for players to play different game modes. Like have daily or weekly event on specific game modes, by giving players double xp after a X amount of matches per day. Maybe that way, new game modes can be added and tried out in the future!- Taunts: So you can dance when you frag someone. Sort of like TF2. (I mean, you are looking at their follow-cam for like 3 seconds when you get fragged).- Bulletin in the main menu of upcoming Road Maps, Special Events and News. This will get players involved and allow new players to get accustomed.- (Maybe this is asking too much) Co-op Survival Mode with some little objectives here in there (to make you move around the map) and backend story?"

There's a good variety of classes and weapons and the gameplay is quite smooth, beautiful in details, and at the same time, very soft for your VGA.My recommendations:The weapons should kill faster, because sometimes I have to unload it to get a kill and then I will die for the next enemy while reloading.The netcode should be improved!Add some difficulty to use the weapons, there's nearly zero recoil.The tank class is broken. Too tanky and still killing as fast as the others."

I personally like the browser version better because it's really simple and everyone can enjoy it (since its free). Overkill is heading for competitive and strange gameplay (it becomes really hard to kill someone if you are not focusing) rather than the ballistic we knew.(Some classes have insane mobility, shotgun is nerfed ;/, getting a kill gets a lot harder, a bit latecy - or a lot, depends,  and sometimes you really don't understand why the dev change the game this way)Don't get me wrong, it's a good game. But it still has a long way to go.(PS: Getting into a game isn't really that hard, you can join a full room *maybe a visual bug*)"

,Recommended,296300,28831863,"Posted: 30 December, 2016",all,absol_89,"Great to see this game released on Steam! I first saw it on Facebook a while back and was captured by the iconic Crysis-like map design. When I launched the Steam version I was impressed by the animation and UI quality. The gamefeel is really snappy and rewarding, with better optimization than many f2p games I've played. Unlocking new weapons has both visual variety as well competitive synergy, where few secondaries feel underwhelming. Big props for the akimbo gangsta aim down sight animation too! The impressive variety of classes feels decently differentiated but not all of them have interesting active abilities. The most notable ones were shadow sprint, sniper cloak and explosive resistance. When compared to a game like Dirty Bomb or Ghost in the Shell (Stand Alone Complex - First Assault Online) their characters have more team impact and things to do when enemies are respawning. Being able to do some more tricks could really spice up this game, such as a class with quick jetpack jump, a spotting sentry or decoy grenades. Melee weapons are cool in this game as well, maybe bounching throwing weapons or left hand shields could spice up the static cover design.TLDR; I really see myself playing this game as my go-to fps quick fix when I want to warm up and don't want to die and wait in BF/OW/CS matches that affect my stats. This has excellent aim practice feel and I hope the new maps have more of the lush crysis-feel that first drew me in. I also hope there will be more dynamic game modes like COD Headquarters.Tip to the devs: I think you can use free weekends as good way of drawing in new players, where paying customers get earlier access to your new maps, classes and guns. That is a good way of balancing them and charging those who play the most with a one-time fee once they already like the game. I rate the game 9/10 for the price and EA-stage it is in :)"

In the mean time, we're years above from halo´s adictive territory control, but this might as well open doors for a better mode that no one has ever seen before, you can always be positive about this:King of the hill: Shadow breaks trough evreything in its path, specially in this mode they could fix it? at least disabling it? maybe?,its annoying it can hide, it can shoot,  it can throw nades, nobody can do♥♥♥♥♥♥about this annoying soldier in this mode.Team deathmatch: some maps just don't work with this, they're breakable, there should more testing involved if there was supposed to be an interesting TD mode in this game.Point Control: Now here is where the cherry really pops, it actually asks you to work as a team as evrey other soldier, pick the best with what you're good at, and you'll do fine, no balance issues here imho.Sniper: THEY FIXED HIM! it's relevant now, and making headshots actually is rewarding. :DNETWORK: Add more servers, and fix the netcode, many of my bullets are not registering.MUSIC AND AMBIENCE: Please add two more scores into it, find a better sound guy.EXTRA:Market this game better plz, we need more experienced players, in all more players.CONCLUSION: Aquiris, have come a long, long way since september with 1.3.1, all in all, they have to be let know that they have something really good cooking in their hands not just a another facebook game.Now, it's not all sunshine and firworks, not yet atleast, there are plenty of ping issues to be looked upon and soldier balance issues, map design and testing to tweak, a lean work milimetric polish, is what this game needs, an UI overhaul aswell, both menus and in game, and since they're a small team,I'm certain that I have nothing else to do, but to recommend this game to any Golden eye,perfect dark,Time Splitters fan without missleading them into one of those examples and without hurting your wallet, this game is his own thing and they owned it."

Leveling up characters and getting new weapons, all very exciting! Ofcourse the addition of lockboxes and weapon skins is very cool, but if i'm honest, i liked it better how they did it on facebook where you coul actually get weapon variants, ofcourse for balancing reasons this is better, which i think we just have to accept. Besides that, the randomness of lockboxes being dropped is non existing, everyone gets a lockbox at the same time and there is no way to grind for skins. This is a thing i also liked more about the Facebook version, getting a good score in a game actually mattered, since it got you new weapons faster, right now it does the same, but it does nothing to getting lockboxes faster.So far i really like this game, but there are still adjustments needed."

The game is now running beyond expectations. I don't know what the devs did, but they're amazing. I now fully recommend this game.TL;DR: Optimization is all over the place. Some people play a smooth 60 fps on potatoes, some people can't get 60 fps on gtx 1080s. As far as I can see devs have not addressed this known issue.I cannot reccomend this game until it is optimized.This game is optimized horribly, at least to me.Others with much worse hardware seem to be able to run this game much better than me.i5-7400gtx 96016 gigs ramI get 25-35 fps on every setting and resolution. It doesn't matter. This is also regardless of ping.I can run what should be much more demanding games at much higher frame rates at much higher settings.I believe this has to do with poor optimization in unity. I suggest that the developers look into these issues.I really do like this game. I like the pace, maps, and accesability of the game. It's like a cod x ow.It's just sad that none of that matters when much of the playerbase can't run the game properly with relatively high end machines.I have tried different launch options, etc. No success.I have high hopes for this game, but don't buy it until you're sure that it will run properly on your machine.Lots of people with lower end machines can run this game at 80-200fps constant. Don't let my review dishearten you completely. I feel like the game is not optimized for 7th generation processors or something. Hopefully the devs see this and get on it.EDIT; Thought running in dx11 would help. It did for about 2 seconds, then the frames dipped back to 25.Don't buy.

Ballistic Overkill is an enjoyable FPS that doesn't take itself too seriously (hence the price tag), but definitely has potential to be a contender for Counter Strike, Overwatch, Call of Duty, etc, upon full release.Pros:- The FPS-RPG element creates a development and growth aspect ashamedly missed by Valve with Team Fortress 2 (which is similar in ways to B.O.)- The variety of classes enables constant experimentation, mixing and matching character perks with unlocked weapons.- The UI/menu is lovely. They've really put effort into the little things like screen transitions and navigating between characters.- The aiming mechanics are impressive, particularly when sniping.Cons, hopefully to be cleared up in full-release:- You can't update a character's loadout entirely while connected to a server during the intermission - you must leave the session and return to the menu. That's a little frustrating, particularly when you unlock a new weapon.- The movement mechanics are a little clunky and wooden, not on-par with the pure and fluid movement found in Call of Duty.

It was a very addictive game that you just want to spend alot of your time on ranking up your class and acount. Some things that i noticed about the game-Each class has another class witch is much strounger than them and can take them down quickly, for example a Tank VS a Shadow.-You controll if the game is fast paced or slow and tacital, for example you could pick the beserker and or shadow for fast, or you could choose the Tank or Marksman for tacital slowpaced.OVERALL: I really did like this game it brings great joy, there are a few things that they can fix and add, but i think this game has a shot of being the CSGO fast pace there never was."

If you've played Call of Duty and Overwatch this is both of them combined. I haven't had any issues yet, but the minor thing i've noticed is when someone is crouched their body is totally twisted when turning. But besides that the game is great. The only thing I'd recommend is maybe uping the damage and range of the grenades minorly, not extremly just maybe a little boost to them. I hope this review helps and I totally recommend this game to any players who like MMO shooters."

It's not really ""a child of CoD and Overwatch"" like all people say, instead, it's simply a better and cheaper CoD.If you love fast-paced games or shooters in general, it's worth your time, definetly.Pros:-great visuals-great optimization and FPS-decent ammount of maps-7 classes, each with their own arsenal and abilities-tons of possible loadouts-progression system with rewards-crates with skins are FREE TO OPEN!Cons:-no tutorials nor offline practice. Because of that, the game's harsh for new players, considering some classes are harder to counter / play against-some maps are small, so you end up spawn camping or being spawn camped in some matches. Fortantely, it isn't as bad as in other FPS games-low playerbase. If you live in asia, oceania or australia, you might have a problem finding a game-classes are simply guys with different arsenal. Unlike Overwatch and TF2, none play a different role (altough team comp still matters)-no competitive mode yet (devs most likely will work on it soon)The game isn't perfect, but it's still pretty fun and well polished. I Highly reccomend it to anyone!Also screw shadows."

The only thing good i can say about this game is that it has steam market intergration, besides that, there are other F2P games that offers much more content than this.Dirty bomb already surpasses this games in terms of content, there are more classes, bigger and more maps, etc.The game is also not very stable, you'll see people flicking left and right while shooting you, guns are also not very balanced, there are some weapon that you may find that has very little use because you already have weapon that are better.And there is also the fact that some classes are very noob friendly, meaning that most people will only use these classes, it started out with the shadow (ninja) and the wraith (sniper), then after the grenadier buff, you'll see at least 3 grenadier per team making the small maps a grenade fiesta, and even worst when they nerfed his weapons but buffed his explosive damage, you can't go out the spawn without being flooded with grenadeAnother thing that annoys me is that the matches are severly unbalanced, you will 95% of the time have a team completely dominating and spawn camping the other team, and people end up leaving because of that, matches can go from 6v6 to 6v2 in less than 2 min which is about 1/5 of the matchI feel that the main reason the game is still alive is because of the steam market intergration, people want the skins, people want the rare thing and sell them for money.In short, buy this game if you have the time and dedication to grind those cases (1 each 2 days with a minimum of 2 hours in-game after each drop) if not don't bother, there are better game you can play that doesnt cost money"

Definitely deserves more attention as the community is rather small right nowThe only serious problem I have with this game is the bad class balancing. Of course it is to be expected with a game that isn't rolling in the dough. It took years for an actively developed game like cs:go to achieve a good balance in guns. Nonetheless Ballistic Overkill is miles behind in this area. As a result, youwillget killed a bunch by some skill-less nade spammers or some overly fast automatic pistol sprayers. More skill-based classes like the sniper are incredibly fun if you have the aim for it. If not I would still advise anyone to use such a class at least once in a while if they want to improve"

My time with Ballistic Overkill has been an absolute joy, and progessing through the huge variety in classes, with their special attributes, and weaponry is exciting, without feeling like a huge grind. Although, I love this game, there is one problem, and it is the lack of a player base. Don't get me wrong you will have no problem finding a match, with maximum players, but it it is not hard to play the same people every day in a different match. Therefore, the only problem there is with the game can be solved if more people give it a try, and with the price point of 11.99, you can't go wrong. Please do the whole community a favor, and try it out, if you love deep, class customization, and fast paced, competitive, fps gameplay with zero microtransacrions, give it a go.

It's a fun game I have played the free-2-play version which its nice. I enjoy both games it's okay if you waste P295.29 because it has good gameplay which has skills and the graphics and animations are nice the quality is very good. This game is really awesome and worth it to waste your money on. It has good maps , classes , and play-style which the reason some of the server are full."

Please do some Promotion I want this game to get bigger!Edit: King of the Hill and Point Capture are avaiable and get played"
