Neither of us were trying to win the game (bridge builder).  We were pretty much on par with one another skill-wise in the beginning.  Suddenly he pulls a fancy move and teabags my character, grabbing his head and smacking his junk against his face.  It was hysterical.I did the same thing right back, attempting to ride his face 'Gangnam style.'This went back and forth from a number of bizarre homo-erotic positions.  The novelty just did not seem to wear off.Thank you, random guy.   Sorry I ended up failing in the end and ruining our teabag-fest.Whether you're good at this game or terrible, it's guaranteed to bring numerous smirks and snickers if low-brow humour tickles your pickle.The pros+ Hilarious 'QWOP' style ragdoll physics (albeit much easier to control)+ Multiplayer with friends or randoms+ A good variety of game modes and tweaks to keep things fresh for longer+ Likely a game that will be revisted a lot+ Amusing soundtrack and effects+ Lots of customizing options for your teamThe cons- Novelty may have the potential to wear off- Limited casual game, easy to try everything in one sitting9.5/10 -  Would put my dongle in a stranger's face again."

It was due to watching friends struggle on-screen trying to accomplish the ""simple"" task of ""walking"" a few feet and/or climbing.The comedy comes from knowing how hard they are trying, yet their on-screen avatar looks absolutely discombobulated. Sprinkle in a few miss clicks here and there, and watch all their hard work go sailing off the screen and to their ultimate demise.I got my $4 back within the first couple minutes of play...and I suspect you will, too.Grab a few friends (figuratively) and open your favorite VOIP software (we just use Steam Voice Chat) and prepare for some mounting intensity and good times!"

,Recommended,296470,14017052,"Posted: 16 January, 2015",all,Gun_Shy,"This game is fantastic, but I must issue a warning:Player creativity and practice is an absolute requirement.Some people say the game gets old quick, and that it's too simple to squeeze enough enjoyment out of it to make it worth the money, and that d!ck jokes aren't funny. Those people are wrong.When I picked it up, I liked it, and it made me laugh my♥♥♥♥♥off for a bit, but I wasn't quite hooked. Then I played a match with someone who was REALLY good at the game, and it showed me the potential for hilariously rewarding gameplay and growth through raw skill. It actually exercises your brain because you have to figure out which keys you need to push next, and in which order, while you're helplessly rag-dolling through the air.Sometimes it can be a little buggy, but honestly, that's part of the fun, and the bugs don't break the game by any means. And even if you don't get very good, the real reward comes from the awkward, flailing movements that still, after 60+ hours of play, occasionally make me laugh helplessly.What I've learned is that this game has two crowds. One crowd, who picks the game up for an hour or two (or less), and decides it's kinda okay, but too simplistic for their sophisticated tastes, and who still laughs at d!ck jokes anyway? And then there's the other crowd who gives it a chance, really learns how to use the mechanics, has a total blast and falls in love.Now, there are obnoxious jerks who play online, that think they're funny, and waste your time slapping your tender bits until the timer ticks all the way down. But just use that as motivation to get good at the game so you can beat all those jerks, and eventually they'll go away, because chances are, they're part of Crowd #1. And anybody you like playing with, look up on Steam and add them, and after a bit, you won't run out of people to play with.I give this game 10/10 hellicoptering dongles."

On top of that the online matchmaking has issues unless you do some port forwarding magic and even then the amount of lobbys tend to be somewhat limited.The 4-pack is a worthwhile buy largely in part to the fact you will end up telling your friends about this game, and nothing like the slapping sound to really drive the point home. I've given this game to a few friends, and beyond gotten my moneys worth when it comes to the reactions and the hours spent relaxing after some Overwatch or Ark with buddies.5/7 Would raise dongers again."

Gameplay is quite fun, geared a lot toward playing with friends either LAN or with voice-chat. You can also play online, or singleplayer to improve your skills.Over the xBox Live version, the PC version of this game has plenty of new game modes not in the console release. Additionally, if you so choose you can in fact use your controller. (This is actually recommended by a splash screen when you start the game.)Again, swinging dongs is not the main point of the game. I saw the dev comment at one point, he made the game for fun, but when he showed it to his friends they payed a lot more attention to the core gameplay than he ever thought they would.So yes it does have quite a bit of humor when playing with friends, but the gameplay is also something to be appreciated.

,Recommended,296470,20771287,"Posted: 26 January, 2016",all,pasta la vista,"The main casualty of advancements in online gaming has been local co-op. We all have memories of convening at a friend’s basement or room and playing games together while screaming about screen-peeking, cheat codes, and all other manner of sore loser-isms. Developer Stegersaurus Software Inc. shares those memories and made Mount Your Friends as a callback to the glory days of old. Needless to say, Mount Your Friends is definitely a much more explicit game than anything we played growing up. Never in my life did I expect to write this sentence but the dong physics are second to none.The first thing you notice about Mount Your Friends is the gang of Speedo-clad, Diglett-looking bodybuilders that you control. The premise of the original mode of the game is simple enough: each player has 60 seconds to climb on top of an ever-growing pile of the other players and get as high as they possibly can, with whoever tops the pile being the winner.The challenge comes from the control scheme. Like the Assassin’s Creed franchise, each of the four input buttons controls one limb. Hold down a button and move the joystick to swing a limb; once you release the input button, if you are touching a surface, that limb will adhere to that surface and won’t let go until you manually move the limb again.Climbing the tower of muscular flesh can be easier once you figure out how to fling yourself from limb ledge to limb ledge, but until then you’ll find yourself slowly climbing up with all the grace of a newborn giraffe. However, this method runs the risk of either under- or overshooting your target and finding yourself flopping through the air until you splat onto the ground. While playing this game with friends, you find yourself either cackling like a madman at their ineptitude or malevolently planning on how to smack the controller out of their hands while playing it off as an accident.In addition to the original race-to-the-top mode, there are a myriad of gameplay modes for both single and multiplayer. You can race to see who can traverse a rocky obstacle course and collect the most coins, make a bridge across a chasm, or even a freestyle mode without a timer to see what flexing muscular shapes you can build.The music in the game is just as well-designed as every other aspect of the game. While playing a head-to-head game, the music takes on this epic feel, as if climbing this mountain of digital flesh is as grand as traversing Middle-Earth. I half-expected Gandalf to pop up as the next climber I controlled. If you pull off a particularly long climb, you hear your character stretch and strain to get that last bit of height.As a multiplayer game, Mount Your Friends is as hilarious and entertaining as they come. Unfortunately, the single player mode gets old after a while. It’s not that the game is boring, but without playing against someone to challenge you, the game loses its appeal. Luckily for those without friends nearby, Mount Your Friends is playable online as well as with a local competitive co-op. There are global leaderboards for those who want to push themselves to keep climbing, but most of the fun comes from watching your friends struggle to climb above the human obstacle you put above them."

,Recommended,296470,11539215,"Posted: 3 August, 2014",all,骰子~,"There isn't much to Mount your Friends. It's a quirky competitive game where you use physics and sticky hands and feet to climb and fling yourself to the top of the tower made up of all the other players. Every player mounting the tower makes it taller until eventually someone wins. It's really simple, well polished, but really fun to play with friends.Solo content is available but it's not too interesting and without enemy AI, it's mostly challenges such as climb one of several given obstacle courses. Multiplayer is the preferred choice if you can grab some friends to play with. You'll be hard pressed at times to find anyone else hosting a public game. Customization is also an option, you can use some of the preset stuff to customize your team or import your own images for the body and head. This is a really cool feature that me and my friends have been abusing to import ridiculous looking characters into our game. The downside is they don't work in multiplayer, only you can see them unless you share the exact same picture with everyone else you're playing with. I'm hoping the devs patch something in to fix this but until then, the best solution is packing everything all your friends are using into a zip file on dropbox and just pass it around to all your friends.Multiplayer has 2 Gameplay modes and 2 Variable Weather Effects that change the gameplay. Vertical climb is a simple climb to the top of the growing tower of friends. Horizontal is the same but the tower must extend to the right of the screen instead of the top. These two games modes are accompanied by Space and Storm weather effects which change the physics somewhat to challenge you. Space gives you low gravity, which makes jumping and flinging yourself around easier, but also more dangerous. Flinging yourself too far on Horizontal can lead to falling into the pit below and instantly losing, while in Vertical, you can accidentally fling yourself off the tower which spells doom for most situation. Storm halts your progress by always pushing you to the left in a windy storm. This makes it hard for everyone to move or climb and flinging yourself is a lot harder.Overall it's quick and easy fun, you can kill time playing it or have a game night with friends, flinging off of Bill Nye in a Bra to achieve your victory. While the Single player content is lacklustre, Multiplayer is fun and worth the money if you have friends to play it with.At £4 it's an easy purchase, unless you really need that £3.99 Whopper Meal.You fat monster"

The characters, the music, the grunting noises as they lift themselves, and the ragdoll physics just make it really entertaining to play.It supports unlimited amount of players, even with just one controller passed to each person when it is their turn which is awesome. It also has an online mode that you can mix with local players as well which is something even AAA titles don't have.The extra gamemodes are a fun additive and the variations keep it fresh. Character customization can be really fun, especially if you make your friends and/or family.The best part of this is that it's 5 USD for one, and 15 USD for 4.

Repeat until failure. You control your speedo clad muscle mans individual limbs with the face buttons of a controller (or keyboard but come on mate) and his hands/feet are stuck tight until you release them by activating their button. The game supports a swathe of game modes and you can play with up to 8 (I think) players making this an excellent party game. Online play is also an option if you can't wrangle a friend to mount. The constant innuendo cements its title of god level party game. This will never be uninstalled for me and is just a magical experience.Good-the sounds are amazing and constantly hilarious-dong swing physics-high skill ceiling and when it all clicks and you can move with speed it has a great feel to it-randomized manly man names-lots of content-multiplayer-a goat. Don't ask so many questions-beat my score at low g distance run, 1200 y'allBad-if hot man on man on goat action bothers you, well, that's the whole game-menus are tad clunky-many manly names are not THAT manly.

You're now obsessed with those♥♥♥♥♥♥♥flopping around in those speedos. Unfortunately, Rule 34 doesn't have enough on the Mount Your Friends category. So you decide to take up art, to make your own pornography. You buy a $100 graphics tablet for your $700 PC and you post all of your art to Rule 34. Then you start writing fan fiction of it.Two years later, you're 21. You're not going to college, and all you do is write fanfiction, draw  crappy art, and play the damn game. Your parents originally accepted your lifestyle, but they decide enough is enough and kick you out. You look for a job, but can't find anything. You eventually sell your PC and tablet for rent, and after enough time you're evicted from your apartment.A month later you're living on the street. You beg for scraps and spare change. One day, you meet a hobo friend like you. His name is Yuu Rai. Obviously he's Asian, from the name. He has a friend, who you instantly forget the name of. She has an apartment and lets you two stay there from time to time. You and the girl fall in love, but you still don't want to admit you don't know her name.Three months later things are getting kinda heated between you two. She and Yuu are still best friends, but she doesn't let Yuu know about your relationship. So you get to bed with her and it dawns on you... you Mount Yuu R.'s Friend."

,Recommended,296470,12738056,"Posted: 1 November, 2014",all,Unkle Adams,"Mount Your Friends was released in the absurd indie frenzy, alongside titles like Goat Simulator and Surgeon Simulator 2013. Mount Your Friends is just as nonsensical as those games, but also features simple and suprisingly addicting gameplay.Its a very simple mechanic; you control the appendages of your players, and you want to climb up a tower and reach new heights. At first the tower is a perched goat, but when the first player ""mounts"" the goat, he becomes the new vertical record, and then the bodies continue to pile up. By pressing the corresponding buttons for each limb, you ""unsticky"" that limb from whatever it was attached to and move it around to reach another ledge. Much like other physics-influenced games like QWOP, the controls seem unintuitive at first, but with a little practice you will find yourself flinging your character up the bodies of your competitors.The single player modes are plentiful but barebones, which is to be expected. There is, however, a surprisingly large amount of multiplayer modes available in Mount Your Friends; the only problem is that they are all restricted to local multiplayer. There are virtually only two modes for the multiplayer lobbies (2-4 players); vertical tower building, and stretching horizontally to create a bridge. There are various settings you can mess with, but these are the only modes available online.Another big feature of Mount Your Friends is the ability to completely customize your character. If you can create head-shaped images and a collection of images for the stomach, torso, legs and arms, you can add those to the Mount Your Friends custom directory and create a player from those images. But again, the games online functionally is limited because your competitors will have to have the same files with the same file names to see your custom players.When this game says a gamepad is recommended, it isn't joking. A mouse and keyboard are playable but you are severely limited in which acrobatics you can perform. You will become more proficient with 2 joysticks and 4 instantly recognizable buttons. I know where the WASD keys are, but it still takes me second to remember which one is which.Despite a few multiplayer limitations. Mount Your Friends is an exceptionally goofy and entertaining game with simple controls that are difficult to master. Buy a 4 pack when you can and enjoy it with a few of friends. Expect a solid 10 hours of fun out of it."

76561197986775314,Recommended,296470,13939031,"Posted: 11 January, 2015",all,Aluminum Elite Master,"Surprisingly good for 5 dollars.What really makes this game is the control scheme: unlike Super Meat Boy, when this game's loading screen says it's best to play with a controller, I actually disagree. Super Meat Boy was a platformer, where a controller really was an upgrade... but here? Here, I sort of think it works pretty well to use keyboard and mouse.The controls are 80% of the game. The rest is learning the physics and planning where to put each figure.Mastering the controls is the real game here. And it's a challenge, but for the right reasons. It's strangely fun, at least for me.And you can pick a safe-for-work mode if staring at mostly naked men climbing each other somehow isn't for you.Ultimately, this is another of my recommended 'minute' games, where you can play and get something out of it in the few minutes between having to do the next chore or bit of homework. Not a complex game, but the simple challenge of the controls and climbing physics is enjoyable, and there's more to this game than the silly title and nearly-naked characters would lead you to believe."

This game seems to rely completely on the assumption that you are playing with friends and dicking around.-ControlsThis game controls terribly. The keybinds are awkward and seem to be more for ♥♥♥♥ing around than for practical Gameplay.

,Recommended,296470,11469605,"Posted: 29 July, 2014",all,Jordan,"Mount Your Friends is what happens when you take Greco-Roman wrestling and you give it QWOP controls and a Jenga mentality.As of right now, the game comes with a variety of modes such as a ""single player"", which doesn't provide the enjoyment you might get with friends, and is merely a ""flash game"" with the goal to get the highest tower.But when you play with friends, either at a party, or with it's online servers, it's a game that really shines. It brings out the best (and sometimes worse) in people. And there is plenty of customization options, including the locations, the team colors, and the ability to make the game ""safe for work"" (which could've been DLC, but the creators were generous in giving you suits and zippers for FREE!)The game can be somewhat addictive, but if you have a long match going with 10-12 people stacked, you might circum to some gaming fatigue. But if you have a ton of internet friends and want to play an admitedly stupid game, ""Mount Your Friends"" should be on your ""Must Play"" list. - 4/5 or whatever scale you want."

As one person climbs the goat at a time, however it does limit the play to one person playing and three to four people sitting there just watching.General Thoughts:-I bought this game so that my friends and I could play it, get a couple laughs and play it another time, and we did play it; one time. The turn based play seems to be a large turnoff as this game never got an encore and we ended up playing games that four people could play simultaneously. The game isn’t bad but you may not play it more than once."

I mean that game is not multiplayer, but it is the exact same principle, with much more going for it. See my review for that game for more info.As far asMount Your Friends, there is not much meat on the bone here (no pun intended). In my opinion, there is literally no fun to be had if you plan on playing this yourself. But I suspect most want multiplayer. Well, I broke this game out at an Indie-Game-Saturday event with a group of friends all in the same room, and we grew bored of it rather quickly. I was a bit surprised, actually. Usually broken physics games work well there. Surgeon Simulator, I am Bread, Goat Simulator, etc. have all been well recieved in the past.Anyways, I am off-topic. Mount Your Friends probably makes more money off of 'shock value' or impulse laughs than sticking power. The game is underwhelmingly simple - and more game modes is not going to remedy that, IMO."

I will say the game itself is a joy my son loves. It is a nice game and I decided to change the review to a recommend AS LONG AS you read the below info and be sure to have a 360 controller as this game requires one for most of it's content.My son's been watching the youtube vids of people playing this for quite awile so I thought we'd get it for our accounts. DO NOT get this game thinking you will be able to do it all, or even most, of this game for 5$. There's a lot of information this page doesn't give you regarding this game. The fact that there is only one mode (climbing the goat type) that you can play online. And even the ""Local only"" modes (such as his favorite FENCING) cannot be played with the keyboard and require an Xbox360 controller ( ISay that due to the nightmare you will have trying to get a 3rd party or non microsoft XBox360 controller to work on windows properly as it's hit and miss like a bad dream). In the end these things should be VERY highlighted on the store page regarding both the limitations and lack of instruction as to how to play this game on PC. (For instance I have no clue, even if I do manage to get a controller to work on the PC, whether the Fencing mode is hotseat? Or has to have two controllers connected to the same comp? Or can be LAN played with both of us on different comps (both requiring a controller?) Ect ect ect.The very poor upfront instruction, descriptions of playability, available modes or even how to get them to work and the total requirements (As each mode seems to have a seperate limitation or configuration as to how you can or are suppose to be able play it) So be warned, as I spent 10$ on 2 accounts, now have to wait for a XBox360 controller that may or may not work in windows without a bunch of hassle, and still not sure whether I'll need another to play the one mode he wans to play the most (Fencing).Very dissapointed and wish all this mess was stated upfront (As most of it is not stated at ALL!) I only wish there was some way to get my money back. Because aside from the xbox 360 controller I now have to wait for, who knows how much more another would cost or if it'll even work at all = a hell of a lot of hassle for this game that I would have never bothered with if it had been stated more clearly....but then, they wouldn't have gotten my money = typical steam grifting."

You can make or own server or play offline by yourself if you want, though.For the main part of the game, it's really just a bunch of men stacking cheerleader style to see who can get the highest.The controls are kinda hard to master, it took me an hour or two to get them down, and using a controller realy is better, as they say.Overall, fun game, probably about 5+ hours of play before you get bored, but I personally keep coming back to it because of it's hilarity and stupidity.

Yes, it's a silly game and the... ahem... ""lower-frontal physics"" are cringe-worthy for some (I find it hilarious), but don't just judge this game by it's cover. The gameplay is actually pretty addictive and the adrenaline rush of trying to beat your previous distance, whether against yourself only or against others online/local, is amazing. The price is VERY fair and it's honestly been a LOOOOOONG time since I felt that way about a game purchase. A few cons (though some might be fixed) would be you can't see your friends easilly in-game unless they're the ones that created the online match (the server name will be the host's name). Another gripe would be that many of us mounting fans would love to see the local multiplayer modes like fencing, for example, added to the online portion but the dev has explained (very kindly and very well, actually) that it would be difficult due to syncing issues and it's something that is very unlikely to happen (fingers crossed).+Pros=Great Dev that actually seems to care=Great, addictive game=Dat dong=Some Customization=Variety of modes=Price-Cons=Online portion lacking in mode variety=Minute issues finding friends online=For some, dat dong... though I disagree lol"

I really dont recommend trying to play it alone, but if you have a group of at least 3 people (Even 2 is fun) it is one of the best games for the price.At the core it is just a physics-based game where you have to climb and build a tower of men each having to go higher than the other. With modifiers like gravity, weather, and level obstacles there is a lot to it even beyond the QWOP like physics. The humor of the game (Naked men you can customize whos dongs flop all over the place) is what makes a lot of it too. Watching your friends try to climb over a tower in a panic while dramatic music plays is pretty hilarious, the flopping dongs make it even better. The multiplayer setup is fluid, unlike a lot of games now which only allow local hosting, which causes people to need servers or hamachi programs. Simply create new game and invite people through steam.I bought the four pack to play with friends on sale for 10 dollars. Pretty tempted to buy another four pack and just hand them out to friends. It's nice to have a game that actually feels like something to be social and have fun with, versus a lot of releases coming out that are based around solo-play with multiplayer as a side thought."

Mount Your Friends definitely hasn’t discarded the excellent, fast-paced run-and-gun shooting that made Mount Your Friends a household name; instead, it’s taken that strength and committed itself completely to the idea that mobility and flexibility are king, making it faster and more focused than any Mount Your Friends game before it."
