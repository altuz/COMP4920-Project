,Not Recommended,296530,10074457,"Posted: 10 May, 2014",all,raixel,"TL:DR - See FINAL VERDICT at the bottom.Ok, after playing for a bit. My impression is this is a ""dungeon crawl (beyond incredibly) lite"" for mobile.It is not for a hardcore RPGer. It is definitely not for a PC gamer who is expecting the depth (whether story or mechanics) that comes from real PC RPGs.IF I played games on my phone (and I dont- I'm VERY anti mobile game, esp those ported to PC - See thread ""i hope this is as good as it sounds"" for why), and IF I was looking for an RPG to while away some time on the train or whatever, It'd be ok for that.Definitely not a ""suck away an entire weekend in dungeon crawling bliss"" game though.Ok for starters, yeah. The textures are really uninspired basic texture packs as Gwion noticed and Angelo pointed out. You could probably find the exact same pack on the web for purchase with a few words on google.The story is...Meh. Thats not really surprising. The dungeon crawl genre isnt known for its stories, but for its intricate dungeons full of monsters and traps.Yes theres 2 NPCS Ive met so far, an ""innkeeper and a ""shop"". The story of why theyre there is beyond weak. And as far as I can tell, you cant buy or sell anything but arrows, rations, and fishing gear at the shop. Why even have a shop? Why not an arrow and rations vending machine?It would have been served better to just have very little story, as Dungeon Master and LoG did. Just a ""a big evil dungeon and you have to defeat the big evil at the end of it"". That worked for the old games.But in this one, your characters actually talk to each other sometimes. And the writing is bland and not really worth being there. The screenshots are misleading, as they show the charcaters talking to an NPC and each other.The NPCs are dispensers, the writing of the charcater's speech sounds like it was written by a junior high schooler. NOT needed.The thing that gets me more than anything is beyond a few screens of basic instruction (that any RPGer pretty much knows automatically) there is NO ingame helpfiles. NO tutorial, no nothing. And the ones you do get are impossible to look at once they're gone.So you get basic self explanatory introduction (Minus what the ""gestures"" are - I still cant figure out how to strafe and it was only through experimentation that I figured out how to work them at all), and NOTHING about unique aspects of the game that you need to know.Like for instance in the character screen there is a yellow bar next to my health. Whats that? Experience? Fatigue? Food? No idea. Suppose Ive got to fiddle around with it till I figure it out.I'm all for not hand holding, but this game doesnt even tell you basic stuff you need to know.That and theres no options screen. So I hope the resolution, graphics, keymap and sounds are to your liking. Cuz you CANT CHANGE THEM.That might be OK for mobile, but on a PC it is an absolute necessity. Not everyone has the same configuration. Not everyone has hands that can use a keyboard to steer. (I have partial paralysis.)The ""gestures"" are a good thing. I really like that as an alternate movement. But theres no tutorial of what to do to work them! It took an ""aha"" moment and 10 minutes of experimentation to figure out why my mouseclicks were spinning the PCs around.So, in summary. This is a PC port of a mobile dungeon crawler. For mobile games that Ive seem, its pretty good. By the standards of the PC, no.Go play Legend of Grimrock or even the old Dungeon Master. If you like dungeon crawls and have an iWhatever, get this game on there. Then you can while away time in the waiting room or on the bus.But I'd recommend actually playing real dungeon crawlers on the PC.FINAL VERDICT:Uninspired, run of the mill mobile dungeon crawler with non unique textures. Will not in any way shape or form impress a PC RPGer, but its worth poking at a bit if its on sale for $2 and youre really really hard up for a dungeon crawler. Way overpriced here though.The lack of any sort of re-readable helpfiles, and not giving basic information about the game's mechanics really sucks. That and THERE IS NO OPTION MENU. That might fly on mobile. Not here.If you have an iThing and want a dungeon crawl to waste time while waiting for the bus or whatever, get it on there. Its ok by the standards of mobile. Not by the standards of the PC."

I've seen other games that were ported from the mobile market that did fantastically, so that's not my major malfunction.What I do take issue with are these things:-You can't sell anything at the one shop - you're forced to depend entirely on the gold you've collected to buy things, and just dump your old equipment you replaced on the ground. For players like me, that drives me up the wall.-No settings. At all. Nothing. SO WHEN THE GAME IS BLASTING YOU WITH MUSIC WHEN YOU FIRST OPEN IT, YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE VOLUME MIXER IN WINDOWS TO LOWER IT.-The puzzles are stupid easy, like you would have to have some serious mental problem (or just be really stupid*) to not understand them. I expected at least a small challenge, and was disappointed.-There's no help area at all. You get the tutorial windows popping up at the first part of the game, and that's it. There's also no Index, Compendium of Knowledge, whatever-you-want-to-call-it for getting to know the classes while in the game- what weapons and armor they use, etc.-I'd also expect an RPG to have something like a Monster Index, where you can see information about monsters you've killed, but I've played RPGs without 'em, so that's more of a want, not a complaint.-That big blue guy. I don't like him.If you're looking for a good dungeon crawler, I'd recommend you look elsewhere.*""Really ADD"" joke removed because someone got butthurt and i'd rather not deal with people with no sense of humor. I'm comfortable with my mental problems and laughing about them, maybe one day they will be too."

Some of the reasons given are not wrong, but it's still not a bad game. I just finished it, which took me 14.2 hours according to Steam, and I do not feel like that was a loss of time.While I was inclined to stop after the first try, as it was frustratingly difficult at the beginning, it started to grow on me the longer I played.It cannot measure up to its spiritual daddy, Dungeon Master, and it's not as refined as Legend of Grimrock. However once you start leveling up and find some gear it's fun to play, and definitely worth its money.It's got 17 levels most of which are quite large with many traps, secret passages and riddles. The latter are not very difficult, so they should be really feasible for most everyone."

First few floors are ok but since around level 10 its just empty straight coridors, since lvl 15 filled with more mobs to grab some extra play time.Graphics are fine, style not so much. Same wall on every level so far. ""Puzzles"" (dont know if I can call it puzzles) are super easy, rarely requiring deeper thoughts. Combat is unnecessarily long and boring. No customization beyond portrait and 4 attributes. Difference in weapons seem to be just in shape. 1-8 long sword is no different than 1-8 mace.First timers or people who just got hyped into this type of games by some of the latest good games should avoid. Wouldnt recommend it even for the people who are desparate for more games in this genre. Just go play your favorite game once more.p.s. one of the Janecs journals describes the feeling after playing this game. Bored. Bored. Bored. Every single word in whole journal entry."

It reminds me of the good old days of cRPG but I cant quite decide which one it is similar to.  Very much like Might and Magic 1 through 6 but with less story.  Also alot like Bards Tale 1.If you liked the older style games (1980's and 1990's) before they became all graphical fluff but dont want to waste time with a story (beyond ""Im here to kill sht"") then you may like this game too.That said, it is lacking in depth.  There is no story beyond ""Hey im in a dungeon, lets kill stuff"" and it feels more like someones early work rather than a polished full fledged cRPG."

It has some nice ideas, like the wheels and colored doors, but that's it. Everything would have been better, if it would have been a mod for LoG. But it's a nice game to spend some time with it and if you like such kind of games you could have some fun.  Most players will probably be disapointed, because everything in the game is rather basic  and the game itself is too short and too easy to beat. You could say, it's a dungeon crawler rather for beginner than hardcore RPG player."

Its all the features of an old fashioned dungeon crawler, and the graphics my not be ""up to par"" but who cares! The game is really good and almost directly revives the genre along with the legend of grimrock. The game starts off quite slow but once you start exploring and getting better gear the gameplay speeds up and you'll be finding more secerets and solving cool puzzels. This game is defiantly not a waste of time and is a great game considering its only four dollars. Most people give this game a bad name because its not another call of duty or battle field clone and it doesn't have guns or really a main objective. Many people won't enjoy this if they want a next gen game or what ever, just give it a chance and if you don't like it just remeber...It was four dollars its not like it was sixty or some stupid price like that."

,Not Recommended,296530,11109100,"Posted: 6 July, 2014",all,Lazaek,"TL;DR:Buggy, designed for tablets/phones, lacks polish.I saw this game early on and voted for it on Greenlight, and after actually playing the game regret that decision. Early on you'll notice that much of the game's features (or lack thereof) are clearly designed for tablet/smart phone use, which includes annoying things like clicking drop down menus to select gear for your party, or all spells having the same generic 'caster' icon with different text for what the spell is, but with no details about what they do like their damage ranges or other effects. Using your mouse to look for secret switches will also move your party -much quicker than using the standard WSAD keys at times, which gets very irksome.The game still has plenty of very low-level bugs which you wouldn't expect for many games even in a beta status, with visual combat glitches being the most obvious even from early on.Overall I'd say the game just isn't designed for a PC gamer audience, and if you're really looking for a similar game that wont dissapoint, go check out Legend of Grimrock."
,Not Recommended,296530,11190722,"Posted: 11 July, 2014",all,Asian Sensation™,"Incredibly difficult to control the group.  You play as 4x different characters in a turn-based RPG.  When a character's attack cooldown is ready, you click on the character's attack icon in order to perform an attack or spell.  My preference would be to be able to select auto-attack for my additional (non main) characters, and to simply play the main character.  The greatest difficulties are in simply controlling the party's movement - the keys are awkward and there is no mouse look.  And while movement and attacks are frustrating, the game would be playable and enjoyable if not simply for the fact that the player is often left with no idea what is required to be done next.I wandered about in circles for hours trying to figure out what I was supposed to do next.  I couldn't reach the key I needed, and there were no switches left, nor rock piles to search.  If only there were a walkthrough - then at least I could complete the game, as frustrating as the game play is.I am stuck with no help available, so I am forced to uninstall."

Combat is not bad, the graphics are not bad, but what really lets it down is that the dungeon levels are somewhat long and uninspired. The UI is very consoley which seems a bit odd in a dungeon crawler like this.

I expected it to look like a mobile game.The controls are slow and clunky.  You are often waiting for whatever time cycle to pass before you can enter another command.  Sure, the pauses are generally small, but the frustration adds up.  Plus, the default swipe movements are always there, so you can end up accidentally moving while trying to activate levers or pick up objects.You can use the 1-4 keys to make attacks, an improvement on Legend of Grimrock which is click only, but half of the default party are spell casters and there are no keyboard shortcuts for spells.And if you accidentally cast a spell with no possible target?  You're still stuck waiting for everyone to return to ""idle"" state so you can move again.You also start with almost no equipment.  You can pick up a few items laying around an intro area, but when the first fight arrived only half my party had weapons.  By the time everyone was wiped out by some golem thing, my shaman had yet to find a weapon and so all they could do was cast Heal and twiddle their thumbs.There is also the inane conversation between the party members.  It's better than talking to the two crazy ladies who run an inn and a shop in a dungeon, but that isn't really saying much.Yet despite all the time spent on text and conversation, there are other areas that are blatantly ignored when it comes to prose.  For instance, the areas you enter and teleport to/from are things like ""2a"" and ""1"".  It just struck me as odd.  There is also no real explanation of what game items are and how they work.  Why do I have rations?  No idea.  Why can't the shaman wield a staff?  No clue.All in all, this game just isn't worth $5."
