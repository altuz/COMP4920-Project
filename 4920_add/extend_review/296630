If you're comfortable with purchasing a game you can finish in around an hour for the listed price, go for it.This is a good game. Fairly predictable, yet surprising in it's own ways. I enjoyed it."

The graphics are great, the game mechanics are sound,  it's a game that had an obvious amount of love invested in it. The reason I don't recommend this game is that it is terribly short experience with a threadbare story and few real action pieces. The game isn't an experience in terror, like some would claim, but felt more like a teaser to a much bigger game. I'd say this was more a $5 game than $10. Even so, if you've got money to burn and an hour to kill, go ahead and give it a go."

The other recurring theme is MODELS:  No, not the wafer-thin things which caper about on cat-walks, but rather a three-dimensional model of the title building and its attendant rooms/sections (an absolutely ingenious device which you'll just have to play the game to ""spoil"" for yourself), as well as some of the hands-down scariest bronze statues/art models you will ever have the good fortune to be terrorized by.I gotta say, it's always nice to be so pleasantly surprised by a game you didn't even know existed until it was already available in the Steam store (the last such game for yours truly was perhaps Outlast, so this title is in mighty good company therein). This isn't to say there aren't a few problems, however...Firstly, the Steam asking price is a tad silly for a game which even I managed to complete in under two hours ('cause believe me, I play games kinda sloooooow).  The project is apparently the product of university students graduating from a game design course, so within those parameters it's impressive as hell, but it doesn't hurt to recognise that even the very best of such projects can't exactly go head-to-head with the ""big boys"", especially price-wise.Secondly, there's a fair few glitches...on more than one occasion, I had a particular enemy permanently freeze on me; which might almost sound like a ""good""/opportunistic thing, but decidedly less so when you require said enemy to cause damage to something in order for you to progress.Also, I had a hell of a time getting a couple of objects to successfully interact with what they were SUPPOSED to interact with.  I especially had no end of fun trying to get a round ornamental medal thing to go into its appropriate slot in a wall...thought I must be missing something...looked up a video walkthrough and lo and behold, the dude playing it gets it in first go without even trying.  One game reboot later and I finally managed it, but again not quite as promptly as Mr Walkthrough did, so...yes, problems, it had a few.  I did however break with my usual cheapskate tradition (of waiting for a decent sale) and bought this game smack-dab on its release date, so perhaps these little bugs will be corrected with time...On the whole, though...VERY impressed.  Expect big, big things from the people involved.  For now, this one merely qualifies as just a single ""big"", but there's no doubt there's some talent involved here.  If I were their teacher, I would definitely give them an ""A"" (but not quite an ""A+"")...but since I'm not a teacher, I'll simply rate them in my standard manor (whoops, make that ""manner""), and round off my review with the customary:Verdict: 8.5/10."

I would reccomend purchasing it on sale.What it does, it does very well. The game is creepy, well orchestrated, has some neat lay-out mechanics, and gives a nice feeling of unease throughout the story... the problem is that there just isn't much story. There's no intro or reason why you're in the manor in the first place... no investigation is mentioned, and the clues to the tale are scattered minimally throughout the game.The antagonist is effectively creepy until you figure out the mechanic behind the attacks and how to stay safe... and at that point, the game suddenly begins to feel like a rail haunted house ride. You're there to experience a mostly linear story, and you can do it in relative safety. It just doesn't feel like it at first.If I knew there would be more game added on to what's already here, I'd recommend it at full price. As is, its just really far too short."

,Recommended,296630,12311891,"Posted: 1 October, 2014",all,SquidofLove,"Great horror game. If you expect a lot of jumpscares i am going to disappoint you. There are moments that Kraven Manor will scare you and make you cry but these are few throughout the whole game. What makes this game an absolute must have in your library is the dark and creepy atmosphere and the general feeling that there is someone, something behind you the whole time. A very beautiful game with gorgeous graphics that will make you forget it's an indie one.The mechanic that allows you to interact with miniature rooms in order to gain entrance to the same rooms in the manor is innovative and brings a fresh breath to the genre.Puzzles are not very hard to solve but neither too easy to think the game is failing. The only negative aspect of the game is the fact that is short. It will take you 50 mins - 1 hour max to finish. The great ending though will make you forget about that very fast. You should buy Kraven Manor if you are looking for a true horror experience.If you enjoyed this review and found it helpful, then please consider following my curator page.

I must say, I love the idea of building a model of the house in order to reach more locations! For the time played, the game was very enjoyable.I do wish it were longer though and hopefuly we'll see something similar to this on a much bigger scale in the future! A lot can be done with building the world around you in a horror game."
,Recommended,296630,18249626,"Posted: 29 September, 2015",all,JacquesLeSauve,"Kraven Manor was developed by a team of thirteen gradate students within a six month time frame. In some ways that fact is all too apparent, in other ways it's surprising just how much was accomplished with so little.A first-person horror set within the eponymous building, the game's unique hook is that the structure of the whole manor can be changed dynamically. This is achieved by finding scale models of the individual rooms and setting them onto a board in the main hall, the arrangement of which determines what can be accessed. It's a really clever idea that lends itself well to an exciting scope of gameplay possibilities... or at least it could, it never really gets used to its full potential here. I think there were literally about two or maybe three instances in the whole game where the positioning of the rooms actually mattered in any significant way. Otherwise, the only thing it affected was the walking distance to the room you were heading to next.I say ""the whole game"", there's isn't really all that much to it. There's maybe less than a dozen unique, relatively small areas to explore, all of which can be seen in probably about an hour for most players. But at least most of that time will be eventful as various set-pieces are triggered with regularity along the way, the vast majority of these being highly effective at unnerving the player. This is largely thanks to the main threat to your survival in the manor, a life-sized bronze mannequin that appears both lifeless and yet obsessive in its focus on your demise, made even more unsettling by its strange behaviour as it will only move and attack when not being looked at directly, otherwise perfectly playing its role of inanimate object.So it has a solid idea at is core, a suitably terrifying creature stalking your progress and is well designed with its creepy locations and adequate visuals. But it's not without its issues. As I guess is to be expected given the nature of its birth, there are technical hiccups and bugs, several of which forced me to reload my game on more than a few occasions (sometimes not triggering an event necessary to progress, sometimes essential items couldn't be interacted with, and on a couple of instances closing the game and spitting me back out to Steam). Loading can also take a while, though in fairness, that's most likely due to the fact the rooms aren't in fixed locations, plus it only seems to load once at the start rather than room by room and is seamless thereafter. Movement also feels somewhat sluggish and cumbersome, though whether this is by design to add to the fear, or a result of poor programming is debatable.Overall this ends up feeling like a very advanced prototype or proof of concept more than a fully-fledged game, and I really do hope it's developed further by the team into a greater experience. Despite its flaws, it really does have so much going for it well beyond a lot of other games in the genre made by more experienced people with more resources and hints at greater things to come for the young talents. So, if you're a fan of horror and have the patience and tolerance to see past its blemishes, then I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with Kraven Manor."

,Not Recommended,296630,23428835,"Posted: 6 June, 2016",all,molokaicreeper,"As a game, I don't think it really works.  If you're looking for terror, this game is a great thriller though... but that's it.  In the gaming category it isn't so great.  If that's what you're aiming for, look around a little harder (first-person puzzle/adventure and drama/terror game - you wont find that here, sorry).Why is it that I don't like it?  Please read...Well, so it begins... you're dumped somehow in an old manor without any clue as to how you fell in such predicament.  It's almost like you woke up from a bad dream and there you are.  With that, you are left with a flashlight (awesome, and if you choose the hard-game option it may not even work), and you've somehow forgotten how to touch, grab, look, observe, hit, examine, etc. anything that isn't pertaining to your game's progress... no ""biggie"".  As you explore you find that you're ALL alone.... or are you?  Nope... and this is a spoiler (so don't read further if you don't want to know this) you find something that may ""possibly"" be alive... a mannequin.. not just any mannequin, but one made out of copper (what the heck?!... copper for real?).  I haven't yet been to the attic, but I already know what the subject of the game might be.... the murderer, the keeper of the manor has been manifesting itself in that mannequin (don't know for sure yet but clues do suggest that).  As you move on, you will probably decipher the fact that guests in the manor were pretty much killed by the keeper at some point.Be careful with most of this game's reviews.... they DID lead me to take the mannequin lightly.  Don't let it happen to you, the mannequin is VERY MUCH lethal.Whew, I took that out of my chest!  Well, the biggest issue I had was the fact that the mannequin is indeed lethal, but there are mechanics that just didn't seem to agree with me.  Having played games like Zork, Montague's Mount, Riven, etc (and loved them) you do assume the mechanics will be similar.  I have to blame myself... I hate spoilers so I didn't look for sample videos (I should've).... anyway, there is no inventory, basically as you would in real life you carry things in front of you, BUT this is what is not very real-life-like... remember the above mentioned? (look, observe, hit, etc) you will soon realize that you are DEFENSELESS in every possible which way.... except for room models, I don't think you can actually carry anything else... a key perhaps, but not much else.  That means that if you're attacked in a dark room, you can't swing... despite the fact that the bedroom and library are full of books (and that books have been amazing murder weapons in the past) you can't simply grab one of the damn things and swing them at the dreaded mannequin.There is no ""real"" save game feature (I hate that in games).... ok... that's not a big problem for certain games, you complete certain puzzles and there; they save.... NOT this one.  This game sometimes saves RIGHT when you're about to enter a room and sometimes, not even.  That's a problem when you're done getting a model and just want to put the game down.  Such is the case with the bedroom, I am not happy I have to do that sequence again!  It should save everytime you place a model on the main counter.  Why doesn't it do that?!!!Anyway, it appears you can't really swing that model at the mannequin's face either (if you needed to).... I imagine myself in this game as a disabled person with a mechanical (crane, hand or device) to carry things with... pretty much.I am not done, and quite frankly, I am unsure whether I want to play this game again :( The issue is not the fact that is scary (not the biggest problem), but when things are scary and you're somehow stupid or disabled, that's just not nice."

Kraven manor takes a lot of time and nerves for the beginner but if you played it two - three times, you will manage it in under an hour.The graphics are extremely good (the game from a pile of students so they did a good job) and the audio is nice. Let me give you a tip: If your flashlight runs out of power, remember a circular route, switch it of to reload and run in circles until the flashlight has recharged. Because when mr. Brass is on your a*se and your out of power, then standing is rewarded with a blood shower."

As far as indie horror goes, it's nowhere NEAR the worst game that I've ever played. The graphics are slightly above average (for indie horror games), and.................that's about all I have to say that's good. Now for the bad. It's incredibly short; I beat it in it's entirety in about an hour. (Not sure why Steam claims I've only spent 0.4 hours, but oh well.) The monster isn't really all that scary; once you first encounter it and understand how it behaves, the game pretty much loses any challenge. The music/soundscape is pretty bland; they could've done a lot more to enrich the atmosphere than they did. Combine all that with a $9.99 price tag and and unsatisfying ending (and overall story, for that matter) and this game simply fails to deliver. If it were a free indie horror game it'd be another matter entirely, but for a game that spent as long in an Alpha state as this one did, it should be much more refined and enjoyable. Buy it if you will, but I don't recommend it."

The details on every inch of the game you encounter looks amazing and sets the perfect mood for the game; cozy, yet spooky. Also, the concept of being able to move different modules of the manor around is quite unique and interesting.However, you don't get a lot of context as to what you're doing in the Kraven Manor apart from reading notes, which nobody really does. At some parts I even got a little bit stuck because of some unclear guidance, where the enemy kept touching me in inappropriate places. I think they could've done a little bit more work on that.Another thing is that you need to properly WANT to survive in order to feel terrified by the enemy, which usually isn't the case with horror games that have monsters with some impressive artificial senses and intelligence. This means it's as scary as you want it to be, instead of forcing it upon the player.All in all, I do enjoy playing this game and I would recommend it to anyone interested in horror games.

It was quite a fun adventure, and for a Halloween sale of a dollar, it's definitely worth picking up and playing through. Keep in mind that it's a 1 - 2 playthrough game, and'll only last about an hour for the first playthrough. If you're into Achievements though, you'll probably play through this a few times. Anyhow, pick it up for a dollar while sales last and give it a go, you won't regret it."

So I cannot recommend this game to anyone even at the low price it is."
