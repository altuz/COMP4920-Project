,Recommended,296730,11791192,"Posted: 20 August, 2014",all,gunslingerfry,"Viktor is a 2D action platformer with 360 degree firing.   Shorebound Studios doesn't have the most amazing resume but this looks to be their first IP and it's feels like it was enthusiastically made.  I played exclusively with a wireless 360 controller.  I took a chance with this game and was pleasantly surprised. It's a pretty solid experience and it does some things very well. Some things... not so well. It's plays like a Megaman game and looks like a Castlevania game.Here's the nitty gritty:The Good- The teleport dash is fantastic. It really feels good. The dash refreshes quickly and about 90% of the time it goes where I expect it. It was obviously the core mechanic around which the game was made (if not initially, then eventually). Cutting corners by passing through them and the snap through platforms feels really awesome.- The pistols feel good. Firing is definitely assisted but not overwhelmingly so. The aiming is sticky. If you let go of the right stick you will continue to fire in that direction. Initially it felt strange, mostly because I expected the character to face the direction of movement when not actively shooting. When I got over that, it lended itself interestingly. There are segments where enemies approach from the same direction and I was able to take them down while focusing on platforming.- Animation quality is excellent. Everything feels very smooth.- Each level feels unique and each boss feels unique. All of them have good pacing and frenetic action. Unique strategies are required to take each one down. The strategies are not obscenely difficult to identify and none of them feel cheap.- Alternate paths and secret areas are littered throughout and encourage exploration.- Enemies and bosses look cool.The Bad- Normal movement feels off. The run speed feels too slow. Maybe I'm used to floaty jumping but you descend like a rock and it's especially noticeable since the teleport doesn't feel that way. Non-teleporting just doesn't feel like it's tuned quite right.- The art design no the levels feels nice and thematic but the areas themselves feel empty. I'm not looking for bullet hell levels of density but the spaces feel underpopulated.  Maybe it just needs more props/set dressing.- Lots of bouncy balls. The majority of the mid-bosses are bouncing balls of various types. Don't get me wrong, I like bouncing balls as much as the next guy but I think there could have been more variety.- The music is only ok. It didn't have me stopping to listen but it also didn't feel out of place. It was sufficient.- There are other weapons than the pistols but for the life of me, I don't see why. I have acquired the shotgun, rocket launcher, and grenade launcher. After using each for a few minutes, I was using the pistols again.  I will be blunt here. The weapons are unimaginative and underwhelming. They add very little value. Shorebound took some inspiration from the Megaman X series, to be sure, but failed to bring with it the interesting weapons that are so iconic of the Megaman games.  Each boss has a projectile attack that could be adapted to use by Viktor.- Boss difficulty is kind of all over the place from very easy to lengthy and difficult.-Viktor is the least impressive of the character designs."
,Not Recommended,296730,21049005,"Posted: 8 February, 2016",all,Eviscerator MK2™,"Why Not Recommended?A suprisingly large number of easy to preform game breaking bugs that you'd expect in an alpha and not a full release which I will go into more detail in the gameplay section of this review.What is Viktor?Viktor is a 2D Twin Stick Shooter Platformer with minor Metroidvania elements in which you'll be going through levels finding new weapons, upgrades, and killing lots of enemies as you search for everyone who betrayed the legion and the one who turned them so you can kill them.Story (has no effect on my opinion of any game)Story isn't anything spectacular it's a run of the mill you were betrayed by your allies and now you're hunting them down to kill them, save the world, and your friend.Graphics (has no effect on my opinion of any game)Graphically it's a vey nice looking game. Enemy variety texture wise is lacking as most enemies appear in all the levels without a slight retexturing to make them fit more with the level but otherwise the game looks excellent and the enemy thing is nitpicking.Gameplay (the only thing that affects my opinions of games)This game is more or less a clone of Bleed gameplay wise but it does enough to differ itself from Bleed. When it comes to being a twin stick shooter it's excellent the dash to dodge mechanic is well executed and the shooting is enjoyable. The dodge/dash mechanic will allow you to phase through thin walls and dodge all projectiles and attacks quite easily. The Metroidvania elements leave a lot to be desired as the aren't that well hidden and none of the items you find are required to beat levels or find other items there's  also is very little reason to go back to previous levels to find stuff due to the lack of things to find so it's hard to consider this a Metroidvania. Platforming is meh there are a few areas where it does try to change it up but otherwise it isn't going to challenge you so there's no real benefits to using a controller. Now game breaking bugs are a huge issues as they're very easy to accidentally pull off and some will happen randomly and all require a level restart. First I ran into is when dashing into a wall at the wrong angle or if you're not close enough to phase through the other side you'll occasionally you'll be clip out of the map with no way back so you'll be forced to restart the level. One miniboss will (the one who bounces around) will sometimes during the fight vanish rendering the fight unwinable so you'll have to restart the level. On occasion a boss or yourself will get stuck unable to move and unable to take damage forcing you (you guessed it) to restart the level.In conclusion Viktor is an excellent game and idea but is held back by a myriad of game breaking bugs that you'd expect in a pre alpha that should have been fixed immediately after discovery.I recommend that you buy heavily discounted or that you get Bleed instead."

Viktor has a lot of good ideas and elements mixing bits of contra, megaman, and DMC, but is hampered by poor execution. When the game is at it's best it's pretty damn good, but it is plagued by too many bugs, glitches and control problems in it's current form. Clipping into walls and getting stuck is the biggest bug that will cost you many a life due to no fault of your own.Outside of bugs it has some flaws including a damage recoil far too great for it's slippery controls to justify and needless use of a lives system (made especially frustrating due to the wall glitches eating up extra lives like candy) and a low item spawn rate that feels horribly imbalanced.This game could be great with some more polishing but until it at very least fixes the serious wall bugs I cannot reconmend it in it's current form."

The game is about dodging and shooting your way to the end boss then shooting him/her as well. You solve most of your problems by shooting at them actually.It's pretty enjoyable, and the visuals are certainly pleasant. I would rave about the overall aesthetics if it wasn't for some of the earlier levels looking very dull and generic, but other than that, the character sprites are well illustrated and animated, and some of the later levels make up for the duller beginnings.Pros:- (Mostly) Gorgeous game with top quality animation- Challenging with out being frustrating- Fun dodge mechanic- Shooting all the thingsCons:- Dull looking beginning levels- Can be arguably light on content"
,Not Recommended,296730,16027752,"Posted: 27 May, 2015",all,retrogomagomes,"Initially I've gave a positive review on this game, I felt very eager to grind through the levels and was curious to see the game has to offer. But as I progressed, I felt tiresome to continue playing it.As I said on my previous review, the graphics are awesome, the soundtrack is very nice as well, the concept between the game is not bad at all aside from the cliché plot. You have a nice variety of weapons and few power ups which help you through the game. Also, the controls are fluid and I haven't had any trouble playing the game with my 360 controller.But as I was progressing on the game, I've realized that Viktor felt like I was playing the same level over and over again. There's indeed a big difference between the levels, each level is an all different kind of world, but what makes them feel like the same? The design isn't much creative, the levels are just run/jump platforms/avoid traps/use your dash to pass walls/and such, in a very boring and linear way. About 60% of this levels you just run on a straight line and jump several cliffs to advance, and the fact that the enemies are the same in the entire game made the level run boring.The levels are not much of a challenge, as the enemies don't change much. The bosses and minibosses are the real challenge of the game, but some boss fights  are just dull. You keep moving and jumping to avoid the attacks and keep shooting until the boss dies, but not in a funny way like the platformer classics as contra, metal slug, megaman, etc. On this games the bosses are challenging and fun, you walk all around the screen avoiding been hit, while on Viktor, you can move in a 2,3 inch radius on screen to avoid the boss' attacks and you're ok.Overall, I think this is a bland game. I wanted to like it because it looks like a neat game indeed. Maybe with more polishing on the level design and the traps surrounding the enemies, more different enemies to fight and a best utilization of the bosses environment (for example on the genie boss screen, there's not much room to move and the boss takes a big part of the screen, also he don't move a single inch) the game would be funnier.Unfortunately I woundn't recommend this game even to a platformer fan."

The design of the very few levels in this game is just dull, you move right on a plain surface all the damn time. Most enemies are annoying rather than fun to fight. Most bosses have uninspiring attack patterns and enormous health stacks making the bossfights as tedious as it gets. Honestly, I tried to give the game a few second chances and yet simply couldn't have any fun with it despite enjoying some similar platformers."

While this is may not seem very original, there are actually only a handful of modern run'n'gun shooters that are well made, so this is an impressive effort.Pros:- Good enemy variety- Levels are decently challenging levels- The boss fights are really well-designed , some of the best I've seen in a while- You have a dash mechanic for platforming and dodging which makes the motion very fluid and energeticCons:- Presentation is average, visuals are nothing special and soundtrack is pretty basic metal-ish fare- Difficulty can be a bit uneven, especially considering the one-hit kill deaths- It's a fairly short game padded by difficult levels a la Megaman. If you play on Normal it'll be rather brief.- Ammo for the better weapons is scarce but your main weapons are pretty decent overall"
76561198041256010,Recommended,296730,10761653,"Posted: 24 June, 2014",all,Black Freedom,First off this is a twin stick shooter....Sooo Viktor has this this problem....which you are gonna fix... Wait... That's not quite right... Viktor has a very dysfunctional family in a very upbeat town. You have to help Viktor talk about past wrongs and...you see the issue here? There is kind of story almost like there is some noticeable bgm. But nothing of note.However what is kind of interesting is the bosses are each unique and Viktor himself has a teleport/dash mechanic to navigate/evade which once you get the hang of makes the game actually kind of streamlined. Easy/normal mode shouldnt run much more than 30-60 minutes and the unlockable weapons are purely optionable since your dual pistols do enough damage.References to Blood of the Werewolf and obviously Megaman since its a 2d sidescroller but I would note that there is not any obvious pathing. No boss is harder♥♥♥♥♥♥♥just... more annoying since there is no weaknesses? In my opinion I would put Shadow Caverns(Shadow) and the Twilight Fortress(Shapeshifter) as Easiest. Arid Wasteland(Djinn)and Frozen Summit(Frozen) as Medium and Molten Chasm(Demon) Sewers(Corrupted) Harder. Small hint for those having issues with Mephistopheles. You can dodge his laser by dashing under him.

In many ways it is not, but it takes the best bits of vania esque games and makes it new. Great platformer if that is your thing. Money well spent. This game is not ripping you off, it is giving you a cheeky flavour of what you already love about Vania esque games. 9/10 Only because there are tiny bugs, which many may never occur to a player.

Controls are very good and allow for great dodging capability.  The player can select a level (similar to the Megaman games) and go through each level looking for upgrades (like Megaman X).  It makes excellent use of the old fashioned ""lives"" systems in the levels.I enjyed every aspect of the game: great controls, fun upgrading options, difficulty, moderate exploration and good music.  My only complaint is that the levels (not the bosses) are generally too easy in my opinion.  I wish they were more on par with the bosses.Some people prefer their games to be lengthy.  If this is your opinion, this might be a concern for you.  It took me about three hours to beat the game on normal mode, but I was happy to immediately turn around and new game + on hard mode (there is also a hardcore mode, which I am insterested to see).Overall, a great action platformer.

They are fun at the start, but some of them get boring when you get their hp bar to half, because instead of getting harder and more exciting, they actually get easier...Also, some boss fights are the same from the beginning to the end. It's not that they aren't fun, but being a platformer twin stick and all, you kinda expect scenario changes/harder patterns when you get them to half of their hp.The statues and shield bonuses are nice, they add a castlevania feel with the secret places and all, but I just wish we had more hidden secrets and better hidden areas.The soundtrack is amazing.I wish we had more powers too. Most of the guns are okay, a few are extremely powerful and just removes any kind of challenge the game might give it to you.We could use more enemies. Many of them are reused in every stage, with a few unique enemies per stage.We could use a time attack mode and a scoreboard.Zane is not well balanced. The stage is a piece of cake for him as he pretty much one hits everything. Some boss fights can be nearly impossible to him, though. But it adds a challenge, so that's actually cool.

I want more, it was really a short journey, but it was a good one.Viktor is a mix of Contra and Castlevania series to me, it may be a simple game, but it has cool bosses, it has the atmosphere and it feels good to walk through the stages.So, the good stuff:+The dark atmosphere+ Cool soundtrack. Really, I liked all the tracks in the game, oh those dark and melodic themes, I want more of this.+ Epic boss battles. Like in contra games, you have to learn their behavior patterns to win. And when you know what ypu're doing it will be a piece of cake.Now the stuff I didn't like:- The game is too short- Most of Sub-weapons are irrelevant. Twin pistols is all you need in this game, really. Well, Sniper-rifle is an exception. It kills everything in your path once leveled up- Common enemies design on stages is really bad. Would be cool if you encountered some more epic foes like I dunno, skeletons, giant vampire bats, zombies maybe, demonic creatures with wings etc. Blazing balls? little spiders? Flying eye-bombs? Little skulls shooting projectiles at you? Really? Those are lame- Levels should be more animated and interesting, they feel a little bit empty as of now.Well, it turnd out to have more minuses than pluses, but hey, I liked the game and I recommend it. I just feel that it had much more potential than this, if there ever be a sequel I hope the guys from shorebound will work on stuff I mentioned and add more interesting things ino the game.

Unfortunaly it took me only slightly over an hour to beat.Gameplay:2D platformer, extremely reminiscent of megaman! It has enough differences to not be a megaman clone, but it does have a lot of similarities. I played the game on normal difficulty, and it was not too difficult altogether (which I definitly appreciated), but some areas of the game did have cheap deaths. Fortunatly, every area of the game is beatable and you do have 3 lives at the start of every level, but if you fail a level, you do need to restart. This got frustrating on the final level, but otherwise was not terrible. The platforming was pretty solid and enjoyable especially with the teleportation ability. I don't think this game has much replay value due to all the levels being fairly similar it style, But it was a lot of fun the first time through. It would have been a lot better if Viktors brother was unlockable.Music:Freaking awesome! It may get repetitive to some people, but I personally loved it!Anything else:Several of the reviews I read talked about gamebreaking glitches, but I did not find any, so that wasn't a problem.

It seems like they cloned the mega man meta without realizing why the specific elements they took worked.- Some bottomless pits are where you are supposed to go, some of them just kill you.- You can pick up different weapons somehow, but that is never explained anywhere, so there is no direction on where to go next. Is it money based? Are they in maps? The game doesn't say.- Health and powerups are all RNG based, ensuring you never get health when you need it or weapon powerups when there is anything to shoot.- After the first mission you unlock a mega-man style world map, but the basic gameplay upgrades are grinding based. So what map should you choose next? At least have a level recommendation on them or something.- The jumping is fine for parkour-like movement because it contains signfigant momentum. But then they throw jumping puzzles in there which are simply not fun. The main mechanic, your dodge/warp move, has an unpredictable movement distance.- The maps take too long to go through just to see how hard the boss is.- Bosses and mid bosses are bullet sponges with way too much health. You end up mastering a strategy or movement pattern by the time you have it at 80% health remaining, and then it's just endurance based. This is the main thing you have to use the levelling up to reduce so you can defeat some of the more hectic boss fights that are impossible to avoid damage from.- On top of all of this there is a timer which they use to give you a rank afterwords.You can see that many of these design flaws are the same as mega man. Hower mega man had better platforming mechanics for jumping puzzles, and clearer game design to indicate where to go next. You could grind for health in mega man because enemies constantly respawned. Mega man contained 1up powerups, and powerups that were built into the level design which singificantly offset the 3 lives issue. Finally it was always possible to defeat a boss in mega man even if you didn't have the right weapon.The TL;DR is the game devolves into trial and error very fast, and punishes you for it. It's basically all punishmentThe art is passable, but not that amazing, It looks like it was all done by one 17 year old guy who just didn't have time to do everything since the game is huge.One positive I can say was the sound design was solid, probably why I kept playing as long as I did. The metal soundtrack is nice and the bullet fire/enemy hit/death sounds have a satisfying punch.I hope they learn from this one though and keep making games, or continue to work on this one to make it ""complete""."

I had a hard time at first when I tried to play with a controller because there is no option to lower the sens. of the analog sticks. I had to switch back to keyboard/mouse combo and aiming was fine after that. The only thing that I don't like about this game is health potions are rare and your health goes down fast. Once you die three times, that's it. You have to start the game over again from the beginning. I have yet to find a way to earn extra lives. I'll keep playing but I'm thinking about asking for a refund."

The game overall isn't terrible, but I got really mad when I found a bunch of secrets on the first stage, which by the way is too long, and died on the first boss. The game was over, and my only option was to start a new game. The experience feels kind of cheesy, and I just don't care for it. You might enjoy it, however."

,Recommended,296730,18471613,"Posted: 14 October, 2015",all,RancorRevolver,"Overall, this game is a solid one. If you're into platformers like Castlevania, I would recommend this one. It took me around 12 hours to beat and I didn't even collect all the secrets, weapons, or upgrades. I found all of the shield upgrades. Those were the only ones that I collected fully. Once you beat it you can go back through and destroy it again with everything you've already found and upgraded. You can do this until you have everything. I definitely would have done it, but I have a channel to keep up with so I moved on to another game. I guess if this game is lacking anything, it's the ability to upgrade your life limit. Three lives per level can still be such a pain with some of the challenges this game presents, but I don't play many platformers so maybe it was just my inexperience."

The music if pretty good and the controls are pretty slick.  The levels never feel unfair or the controls punishing.  Nine stolen cheese wheels out of ten!"

,Recommended,296730,30077496,Posted: 21 February,all,Lomein,"Viktor is a rather fun, if slightly vanilla, shoot-em-up platformer with a host of interesting enemies, a pretty sweet soundtrack, and some neat mechanics.That is my first impression. Though it has me intrigued and I plan on playing more, there are a few game-breaking moments for me, like when I dash and clip clear through the wall and into an inescapable area outside the bounds of play. That being said, i can also use it to cheese out difficult narrow platform areas and find some secrets, but uh...yeah, kinda game-breaking....literally.That being said I got it for <$1 (sale ends 2/27/17) and really enjoy where the game is going and I plan on playing the hell out of it."
