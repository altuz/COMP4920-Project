I ran it at full everything and it never saw a chug or hiccup. The lighting was done well and you felt like you were actually boxing. Fighting in Russia saw snowflakes and in Vegas tonnes of flashing lights.It's the little things that get to you after grinding the career mode. Firstly, it's a grind. If you win the first belt quickly you will need to replay the same tournement a few more times to earn the credits to level up your character to stand a chance in the later stages. But by the time you've done that the game's terrible AI flaws are very apparent and you won't need half the stats.Start with a block, jab until your stamina is gone. Block and repeat. You have no actual need for uppercuts/crosses at all. No matter when you knock someone down, you get the same animation as they teleport to the middle of the ring and all replays have what I can figure as sneaker shoe sounds. This is boxing, not basketball.But the MAJOR gripe I have. In BOXING you knock an opponent down 3 times... TKO. Real Boxing doesn't have that. I knocked one guy down 5 times in ONE ROUND...... That alone makes me not want to recommend the game. They spent more times working on the giggle of the breasts of the ring girl then googling how Boxing is done."

76561198110073193,Recommended,296770,11043392,"Posted: 2 July, 2014",all,OLD FRESH ™,"Do not be put off by all the negative reviews comparing this game to Electronic Art's Fight Night series of games. Fight Night is a AAA Sports title created by a developer who has a long history of developing boxing games, and it costed 6-times as much as this game. Of course Fight night going to be better, but that does not mean Real Boxing is not an enjoyable game worth it's $10 price tag.Real Boxing Is more arcade than simulation, and there is not a lot of depth, but the action is fast paced and the multiplayer mode should be entertaining for hardcore boxing fans, at least in short spurts.  The single player career mode is basic, and there are not all that many different characters to fight against, but the mode exists. There are options for editing the appearance of your boxer, but you do not seem to be able to edit your boxer's name, which is a little bit annoying.Aside from that, there are also the standard training mini games that you would expect to see in a boxing game. These mini games require you to press the right-stick in a certain direction in time with the on-screen cues. As you might guess the mini games become repetitive very quickly (but so did the mini games in fight Night).The in-ring boxing action is not very simulation-like, but it's not exactly the mindless button-masher other reviews make it out to be.  You can throw all the punches you would expect (using either an anolog stick or the buttons) but there is no option for using dirty tactics such as headbutts or low blows. You can grab and clinch your opponent, but only when your energy drops below a certain level. Blocking is done with a single button, and it automatically blocks head or body shots as needed. You can also use a perfectly timed press of the block button to slip an opponents punch, creating a slow-motion effect allowing you an extra moment to throw a counter punch. There is no bobbing/weaving. There is no way to take a knee if your getting pummled, and there is no option for switching from orthodox to southpaw stance.Pros:- Fast paced action with easy to pick-up controls- Decent looking graphics and presentation for a budget title- Online multiplayer boxing matches- Commentary is repetitive but sounds good for an arcade boxing experience- it's the only (somewhat realistic) boxing game on SteamCons:- Boxer movement/footwork is not very smooth- Small roster of characters - No real world boxers- Short/uninspired single-player career mode- No matchmaking options for the online multiplayer modeThe bottom line is that it's not exactly a great game, but it's the best boxing game I have on my PC. The game will not have much appeal for most gamers, but hardcore boxing fans will probably find it fun being able to swap leather with other players now and then. It's not Fight Night Champion, but it's actually better than I had expected it to be."

The animation is standard at best, stuttering and ugly at worst. Also the ""career"" itself is a joke, with tournaments aligning one fight after the other, with just marginally different fighters/animations.That you have to ""buy"" nearly everything from customization to your skills is the bothersome part.Can´t really see much good about this game, except that the low price is fitting to its quality."

I have this boxing game (REAL BOXING) on my iphone and I enjoy it, here on the PC version they have removed the micro transactions and given you the ability to move around the ring which is something that feels added because that part of the game just seems a little sluggish, there are no Muhammad Ali dancing masters here just flat footed Rocky Balboa type club fighters. But I have to say this is the best ""PC"" boxing game I have ever played and will gladly support it in hopes we get more Boxing games on PC. The graphics are good, the game supports both keyboard and controller inputs, I like that you can adjust the number of rounds and length of rounds.  There is a quick fight or a career mode, in career mode you can customize and train your fighter to improve his attributes, (although you cannot rename them* UPDATE- The Devs say you can rename the fighter when you create them, click in the box with the name and retype the one you want), there is also multiplayer which is nice and I look forward to. I do not care too much for the in game music or the lame commentator, however the punch sound effects are decent.  I would like to point out that although the Ring Card Girls do seem to have nice physics for their breasts the game really could work on Presentation and Fighter Damage. I would really like to see the DEVs work on and add various cuts, fighter fatigue, some swelling, better footwork, corner men working on fighters between rounds, camera men outside the ring, better fight commentary, a in the ring referee, and ability to change fighter name and face. I will say that I did have a great 12 round fight last night that was very close, I knew this going into the last round and was worried, I did win on points!  I am really hoping that the DEV Team continue to update this game, there is some great potential here and a wide open market for it, now if we could only get someone to make good hockey game! So if you are on the fence I would say get it, it's your best PC option for boxing right now and a decent game for the price. This game screams for the STEAM Work Shop- let the modders go wild and shut EA down!"

Thank God it's only a fiver because this game is not a step back but a long long jump back from fight night champion which was released in 2011. There is about an hour of enjoyment here if that, until you realise how lacking it is. It's basically a button basher with no thinking whatsoever. I've had a few online fights and even though the first couple of fights I beat the guy senseless and knocked down my opponent I lost on points somehow, I think when punches are blocked they count as an hit. I quickly realised that if I spam the counter button then it's an easy win.It's only a fiver but I still feel i've been ripped off. If you buy this then after an hour you will realise it's money wasted. Shame because I would love a new good boxing game to play."

,Not Recommended,296770,24235982,"Posted: 10 July, 2016",all,EmilioGomez,"As a pugilism game, Real Boxing exists in a category all its own, and not in a good way. It isn't realistic enough to pass as a sports career simulator, nor is it fake enough to pass as a Punch Out! clone.Boxer customization is limited to the same two character models (tall troglodyte or small Asian) with varying skin tones, hair styles and tattoos. You can buy your character different gloves and shorts, but they're expensive and with little variety. Facial animations are so limited that you can barely tell apart the winner of a match from the loser. The round card girls range from a dead-eyed blonde to a dead-eyed brunette. The training mini-games are uninspired run-of-the-mill rhythm challenges sans the music. The fighting physics are rough, with knockout animations totally unrelated to the type of punch that provoked them. When more effort is put into the bosom-giggle physics of the girls than the fights themselves, you know you're in trouble.There are some good details in Real Boxing. Its fight mechanics are very easy to learn. The ring environments look very good. Career Mode is limited to only 27 fights in 3 categories, so at least it's a very short commitment. And you can't beat the price. All of Real Boxing's many defects would be forgiven if at least the game was fun.Vivid Games seems to be doing well with this franchise on mobile platforms by doing a Rocky tie-in. I wish them well. I believe eventually they will make a great boxing game, but Real Boxing isn't it."

The sounds of punches landing and that sort of thing is satisfying. There is supposed to be bruising and stuff on characters who take hit's. But I didn't notice any of that. Maybe the Australian version is censored or I need to select it in the options.You improve your boxers stamina, speed and strength by complete mini games (the skipping, speed ball, hard bad stuff). You basically just have to press key's in a certain sequence. I think it's supposed to get progressively more difficult at high levels. Then you fight. You can do quick fight (which just pitted me against the same AI opponent repeatedly), tournament for a series of fights or online vs other players. I didn't wait long enough to get matched for an online fight so I haven't seen what that's like yet. Also I'm sure you're supposed to be able make bet's using in game currency on matches but I couldn't find anything like that.Beating up your opponent and knocking them out is fun. Initially I just spammed the exact same punch repeatedly and won matches without a problem. But in career mode it was starting to get hard by only the second match.I think this game could be a lot of fun because it look's like it might be really challenging to beat the career mode. And I really like the sound of the online mode. Might be really good to vs. some friends. You can punch people over the internet.

,Not Recommended,296770,13304882,"Posted: 10 December, 2014",all,nusensei,"The fact that this is a handheld/mobile port is frighteningly obvious. While there is a lack of boxing games on PC, this game is not up to standard. The animations are very poor and the gameplay is poorly thought out. Career mode is very skinny with three mini-games that you can only occasionally use to train your boxer, and the title fights are insanely easy on the first circuit and insanely hard on the second circuit. Progression is really repeatiing the same low-level circuit until you can get enough cash to boost your stats to survive getting hit in the next level.The fighting mechanics lack any flow or depth. You cannot throw combinations, so boxing is simply a matter of tapping the jab or hook button. Blocking is a one-button affair, and while you can punch through a block, you don't have enough stamina to exploit it. Hit reactions are awkward - punches don't connect to the opponent, so if the opponent is staggering, your punches are sure to miss, which is very unintuitive. The counterattack system seems like something nice, but it's really just an opportunistic slow-mo which is botched by the lack of fluid fighting.The characters are all the same. There are no distinctions between boxing styles, so it's really just a slugfest. It's disappointing to see a ""Real Boxing"" title feature nothing that makes boxing real.Some other huge flaws:* Clinch mini-game has no timer. You can clinch for the entire round.* Getting up from a KO immediately goes into the fight, allowing the opponent free hits before your controls are live.* No three-knockdown rule. The AI is generally unable to come back and gets knocked down right away, but there is no way to win by TKO.In a nutshell, winning the game is merely based on when the AI ""forgets"" to block rather than any tactical gameplay."

I've been in three amateur fights and even though it's not a pro fight I have to say this game isn't like real boxing. Basically whoever has the higher stats wins the fight. And you can't increase your stats while you're in the ring. Only outside when you train in the gym. And the training simulator is pretty bad too. If you want a good boxing game this isn't it. Find another one that's fun. If you want a realistic boxing game. Fight Night Round 4 or FN Champion are good ones. This wasn't that fun and I'd have to give this game like 5/10. The only thing good about it are the graphics. The game is very repitive. Like when you get into the ring the guy always says ""this'll be a fight to remember"" and the walk in intrance is always the same besides different music that you don't get to pick yourself.

,Not Recommended,296770,11136189,"Posted: 8 July, 2014",all,Elicas,"TL:DR - Not a boxing sim, but an arcade beat-'em-up. 6/10'Real Boxing' is exactly the opposite of what it says on the tin. This is not, in any way, shape, or form, a real boxing game.First things first, the game doesn't help itself by having a shoddy set up. The game defaults of medium graphical settings regardless of your rig when you first start the game. Do yourself a favour, ignore the people moaning on the forums, go into the settings, set everything to max and switch blood on, then restart the game. The game looks at least on par with Fight Night Champion, possibly better, though it's hard to tell as this has a more cartoony aesthetic that makes a direct comparison difficult. For a budget title, the graphics are more than adequte.It doesn't help that this was obviously put together by people with no real knowledge of boxing. A 'right jab' is not a jab, it's a straight cross. Common terminology here people.So, the boxing itself. This game stinks of 'gotta match budget Fight Night' all the way through;Training mini-games? Check, but they're ripped straight out of a late 90's early 00's copy Dance Dance Revolution and require you to press the right button when it flashes green in a box, at the right rhythm. The training teaches you absolutely nothing useful for in the game, it's bashing buttons to increase your stats.AI that struggles to overcome a simple jab-jab-straight combination? Check, with the added bonus of having an AI that only seems to throw Hooks/Uppercuts, it's easy to play an outside fighter and jab them to death. Speaking of styles...Even less of a distinction between the styles than Fight Night has. No stances, no punch styles, as far as i'm aware no southpaws, no footwork, no leaning beyond a rudimentary 'press button to dodge'.Unlimited hold button to block? Check. Slightly better than Fight Night in that 3 punches will break the block, ruined by the fact the canned stagger animation ALWAYS takes them out of the range of any of your punches, meaning breaking the block is essentially worthless. Speaking of animations...Animations are horrible. Knockouts could have come from Knockout Kings on the old N64, no physics, no impact, just a guy falling over like a tree. Tiiiiimbeeeeeeer!Canned, nonsensical commentary? Check! My guy has not won the title, it was a standard tournament match with nothing on the line. 4 jabs in a row is NOT a 'tricky combination', a straight cross is NOT a 'nice jab'.Bad blood effects? Check! After the bad blood developed in the Fight Night community after EA rebalanced the blood effects with the bare knuckle DLC, this game looks like it's been made by a group of 15 year olds who think every boxing match should have arterial blood sprays coming from every hook. The ring gets spattered with bright red blood, dripping from each fighter by the end of the first round. Speaking of damage....There is no inter-round mechanics. No trainer tips, no swelling/cut management, no punch stats. Your health is auto-healed between rounds and you have no real idea of how you're doing, as there are no colour commentator scoring cards.There is also no referee. This means no fouls, no point deductions, unlimited clinches, no rabbit punching, etc. The clinches are especially annoying, as there is no end if you and the AI are evenly matched. It's another pointless minigame.There are some pros for the game however. Punch stats are generally realistic, as your fighter will be winded after throwing 4-5 punches that land, or missing 1-2 punches. This leaves a realistic rhythm of jab-jab-hook/cross/uppercut before backing off again and finding a new angle. This is however ruined by the lack of footwork etc. meantioned above. It is also ruined by the fact that Stamina is permanent and non-degrading. This means body shots have no value whatsoever. It also elaves something to be desired when you're pushing for a KO, as there is no way to keep up real sustained pressure.Overall, this is an above average game. It's very reasonably prices, it looks and sounds fine, while the gameplay has been made by people with no real understanding of boxing. Treat it as a arena based quick beat-em-up, with 3, 1 minute rounds, and it's passable.Better yet, download an emulator and play Fight Night Champion.6/10.Edit: Upon completing the game, several achievements did not unlock. 3/10 if they don't sort this basic functionality out."

The majority of the time I am cought in an infinite search never leading to a fight. During training the symbols that correspond to what you need to replicate dont appear.

Block is anything but responsive which should be essential to ensure before release. Campaign mechanics are really poor. The stats make no sense.

If you knock him stupid and and he's staggered and can't defend himself, your character suddenly loses the ability to move forward, and more importantly can't hit him with what would most definitely be the killing blow. If your character is staggered, your opponent can teleport punches from incredible distances with relative ease. No matter what your stats, your health bar will almost always be less than your opponent. He lands clean shots that you blocked, blocks devistating blows without actually blocking, and will most always win the clinch or use it to run out the clock (which is ridiculous - where's the ♥♥♥♥in' ref...?) And this is just the tip of the iceberg.I can't image where this is gonna go when I, (if I'm allowed to) advance in the game.Like I said, I admit I suck at video games, so it really frustrating when a game that may have won fairly pulls some crap like this.Games that cheat are the reason I stopped playing games back in the Nintendo/Atari days because I'm hardly good enough to win in a fair competition.The only reason I'm NOT recommending this game is because of that. But if the game developers fix it, or at least update it with an easy level option for non-gamers like me, I'd switch back to a positive review and recommendation in a heartbeat.

This can only mean that the game was so flawed that there was nothing I could do but give it a miss and not feel guilty that it was being put on the backburner...permanently.Why?Initially I had trouble understanding how the game worked because I don't really watch boxing, nor do I ever play it in real life or in the virtual World, even though I personaly have thrown a punch or two during a pub crawl. So because I only knew the basics of boxing, it should really have meant that I would struggle in a game happily named ""Real Boxing"", but alas here is where I ran into quite a big problem.Since I was a huge novice, as expected I lost my first two matches because I was doing what I thought was ""real"" boxing. That was to try and ""mix it up"" and jab a couple of times, then try a much more potent move, wowing the crowd with a powerful KO. Instead every match seemed rather tame and while they were close affairs, I could not buy a win and quite honestly things were going as expected.During my first three career matches, I had lost two games on points and the last had ended as a draw but things were about to change...drastically. In the game I got myself a draw, I noticed I didn't have to throw so many varied punches, but just throw one particular punch, a jab - then back off a little to recover my stamina. It was a cue that I would definitely bring into my upcoming fourth match where I decided to roll with this uninspring but effecive style of boxing and went back to the ring seeking revenge with my new jabbing prowess...In my fourth match all I threw were jabs, and did so with devastating results. I got the combo count to about 3 or 4 then as my stamina wore down, I backed off and let it recover and then I just went back in and hit left and right handed jabs again and again. After each round I had landed about 40 to 60 punches and my adversary had a mere 5 to 15 each time. At the end of the match, I had a resounding unanimous victory.I then went to the gym and put all my winnings into my boxers speed and also completed the mini games which were available. After 4 matches my speed was something around 70 and by 3 hours played, it had hit the 80 mark. I had a quick footed boxer, with fleeting punches ready to lightly jab into any boxers face as if he were putting on powder with a puffy makeup brush. It was a heavily feminine style of play, but it was effective - and I was tempted to call my boxer Blue Steel.I won every single match with complete ease, all the way to the title belt!Yes you read that right...! Even though I started with two defeats and a draw, I won match after match thereafter to become the champion. So I went up a division and again put all my coins into speed and again with the same boxing style I won fight after fight all the way until I hit the uninstall button on the game.This game has a lot of fighting mechanics, but you don't need any of them. You don't need uppercuts, haymakers, strength, perks, hugging or whatever it is called when you take a nap on the other boxer, etc etc etc.You just jab and run away, and inevitably win - which some how reminded me of World of Warcraft back in 2006 when I used to ""dot and run"" with my Warlock. If you don't know what that means, then you know exactly how I felt when I first started playing this game - clueless. Yet at the end you feel like a champion and it's not because you are good, it is because the game is completely flawed.Rather than kid myself that I indeed was a ""real"" boxer, I inevitably preferred to uninstall the game. I knew I was nothing but a jabbing phoney and I just could not bring myself to win the career mode knowing that.  Who want's to be the Lance Armstrong of boxing?I know I didn't.I give this game an F, or 2 out of 10."

If you go into the game trying to compare it to that, you'll be disapointed to say the least. But, if you go into it looking for a game where you can waste a few hours every now and then beating on peoples faces, you'll quite enjoy this. This is a mobile port, but I was surprised to see that it's not your crappy run of the mill port that you usually get. The graphics are decent, not mind blowing, the controls are very responsive, and it just feels good when you land hits on the AI. There is a career mode where you can create your own character and fight various other fighters in a bracket for a belt. Leveling up your character is quite fun. The more fights you win, the more points you get to help level up your character. You can even buy perks for your character to get more of an advantage. The fights do sometimes come down to button mashing, but there are also tactics involved in being proficient at the game.There is also multiplayer. I've played a couple matches and it's great so far. I got my butt kicked in both, but I admit that it was a fun experience. There was hardly any lag and I connected immediately when another person was found. I was surprised that the multiplayer even worked considering how some of the big AAA titles that get ported to PC can't even get their multiplayer to function properly.Now, are there things that this game can improve on? Yes, of course. Many. Camera animations, voice acting, more mini games to help boost your characters stats, better character customization, and just overall a lot more content can be added to the game. But, if the devs continue to improve upon this game, it can turn out to be something truly fantastic.Edit: Yes, you can play against your friends in multiplayer.

Which means I have still yet to knock down any fighter at all. Even after all that I still find it to have a solid structure to the game and if they add the things I talked about, plus custom boxer creator it would make the game a hit.

Goddamn where is this game real?The graphics are ok, maybe decent. The gameplay ? well almost no mobility for the characters, only one block move (which block EVERYTHING until you block 3 hits and then you are block breaked) for 12 hits you can use. But the range of the blow is weird at best. Sometime your char does'nt even try to get close while hitting. In the same trend you can counter the ennemy. (you can even perma dodge until you get a counter chance -_-' ) But what happened after this counter is that 70% of time you can't even reach the stunned opponnent standing helplessly behind you ! (but you can use your stamina in the attempt).Oh and I almost forgot => the win can be managed with jabs ONLY. And I must say that those jabs are almost as much deadly as hooks or upper, but way fasters and they interrupts ennemy attacks pretty much all the time.Last point to gameplay the training, it's a king in hid kind, it's like dance dance revolution, except it's slow, and only move harder with the number of buttons, so it's still dull, yet ""harder""...If the game were to be ""ready to rumble (PC edition)"" it would be great, but as it stand ""real boxing"" is a big ♥♥♥♥♥♥ lie.

Waste of $8 wish steam offered refunds for abandoned projects and 1/4 finished games.Interaction:Was hoping for a game like EA fight night where dodging and blocking as well as good combos would win the day (i.e. skill). Dodge is the same button as block, press to dodge (i.e. tap spam) and hold to block (i.e. wtf i pressed dodge not block... oh you gotta tap spam to dodge). Took me about 30 matches before i figured out how dodging worked. Even after I figured it out, it's not interactive. You dont dodge incoming blows, you predict them before any form of movement has ensued.Apparently this is a mobile app port, makes sense as playing on PC you can't react to anything in real time as i explained above. Its like a dance simulator except minus the visual cue's. If you react while a punch is being thrown its too late. You need to react before the punch is being thrown, like some form of anticipatory foreplay. This made me really sad as it removed all tactical gameplay.Gameplay:So playing through single player, you will notice STATS MEAN EVERYTHING.There are 3 main stats (ikr way to many to manage :P) Strength ((how much damage you do, opponents strength stat affects this) ie. 100% strength will do way more damage vs 68% strength than 92%)Stamina ((how quickly you gas out) doesn't really affect♥♥♥♥♥♥as even with max stamina vs low stamina you can only throw 3-4 punches before being gassed, it only really affects recovery speed in a high vs low stat (like strength as above))and speed (who hits first) this doesnt really affect much either as i will explain later. Doesnt matter who hits 1st unless its against high level bots who can dodge like it has its own button :PFor instance you can have better Stamina and speed yet be losing by 3 points of strength, the person you are fighting will hit you and do 3 to 6 times as much damage (ie. 10 vs 30 or 60 damage). even though you are hitting 1st and more times.Punching doesn't involve any tactics either, as there is a generic high block and no real dodge function. So if you both swing both will hit (depending on punch choice), then it comes down to stamina or strength. i.e. Who can punch for longer or who hits harder. So if you have more speed and stamina you can do 1 more hit at less damage against someone who does more damage in less hits with strength i.e. as above ^So playing through all the single player if you just level up before proceeding you can come out and 1st round KO everyone by just swinging then block recover stamina and swing (rinse and repeat)Character development:As stated stats progession is the main point of the game. If you try to play through the game and do the minigames every 5 matches you will have a bad time. Mainly because the minigames are horrible. You are better off just restarting the tournaments and buying all your stats with the cash winnings.Character creation:You can choose between about 8 premade characters and where you are from and your name. Def next level for a mobile 99 cent app port.Multiplayer:finished the game, decided to try multiplayer got some poor guy without 100% stats. Noticed a lot of lag and blackscreen between the knockdown screens i.e. 3-4 seconds. Also noticed a lot of delay, so im guessing matchmaking isnt done on ping.All in All:Wasn't impressed, the game offered no challenge and when it did (i.e. understats vs higher levels) the lack of an effective counter (i.e. dodge) really made it a pushing isht uphill problem. I actually like playing fightnight against way OP opponents as you could still dodge and outskill them, This game offers none of that depth. Its a 3d SNES port of mike tysons punchout."

Fight Night is a 'Triple A' title from a company with a seemingly limitless budget at it's disposal. Don't be turned off by so many bad reviews that this game has to be Fight Night or it's junk. Fight Night is a full-priced title and this is a budget-priced title ($8 at the time of this writing). Some people need to set their expectations appropriately.That said, I really enjoy this game. Part of it might be related to how long I have wanted a boxing game on PC. Part could also be due to having my expectations set so low by reading so many negative comments from others. I can say with certainty that I am glad I didn't listen to all of those comments. The game is not nearly the ""button masher"" that several people have made it out to be. Speaking of button mashing, you can also use the analog sticks to fight, which was a pleasant surprise to me, as I must have missed that bullet point prior to purchase.There are already several accurate reviews already out there (look up ""Courteous George""'s for example.His is spot-on in my opinion), so I won't go into great detail. I will just sum this up by saying it's not Fight Night, but it's not a button mashing half-hearted boxing game that was made in a few weekends as some sort of money grab. It is a quality budget title (yes, they can co-exist!) that I would have no problem calling Fight Night Lite, for those who cannot get past the Fight Night comparison. :-)"

Do your homework before you buy as this is not a triple A title being sold by EA.Is there anything wrong with this game? No there isn't. Graphics are as good as they come and do not interfere with game play. The game play itself is relatively simple and sort of copies the usual boxing controls we're used to. The right stick just tapping it diagonally left or right (upwards) initiates a jab, going left or right initiates a hook, and going bottom right initiates an uppercut. The punching system sort of feels arcade-ish to a point but has it's moments of simulation. Regardless, the impact system is rewarding and it's nice seeing an opponent go down after countering a punch, putting a few combos together and finishing with a nice hook. The movement system is a bit unfamiliar however the dodging system is again rewarding. The time slows down, your stamina rises, and your fighters ready to deliver a blow given you tell him to.I like this game. This isn't fight night as many other reviewers are saying but there is enough depth in this game to keep one busy. Train your fighter, make him fight in tournaments, single bouts, make money, spend it at the gym or on your appearance.For what it is, I'd give it aRATING : 6.95/10.GameplayB-Story / CampaignC+Visuals / User InterfaceB-Sounds / MusicC+Replay-abilityC+OverallC+***update***I wouldn't buy this if you're barganing on playing your buddies for fun.

If you want total boxing simulation fun time, buy a console and support EA's decsision to ignore the PC gamer community.If you are in the mood for a boxing arcade game, Real Boxing is the game you are looking for.  It uses the Unreal engine and it's obvious imediately.  However, the use of the engine in this case is rather uniqe and it's neat to see a developer using the engine for something other than an FPS.  The single player mode is pretty short but it is useful for building up stats to kick♥♥♥♥♥at multiplayer mode. The training mini games are pretty repetitive and snooze-worthy but getting good at timing is pretty useful too in the long run.Some reviews say that this game is nothing but a button mashing fest.  I have found that having a strategy and timing punches works a lot better than just button mashing, especially when your character's stats are low. The controls are pretty straight forward and are similar to other fighting games on PC.  Having a gamepad is ideal.Don't let the bad reviews fool you.  This game is a pretty good experience for the money providing you aren't expecting a Fight Night clone.

Plus it's the only boxing game in steam that i know.Combat is more toward simulation than arcade gameplay, where you can't simply smash buttons to win. You need to think your strategy for the whole round, and the following ones. I found the mechanics equilibrated (although dodging is a little irritating, but adds a random factor to the combat).Playing tournaments to grind stats could be a long run or boring for some people, but for me it's fun (always wanting more and more!), while learning how to play deeper at the same time.In my case were around 17h to win all tournaments (3) without any KO/lost match (leveling stats before to a little more than my adversaries). Although the last tournament is always hard.Graphics/animations are great, the sound/music is ok, the feeling of contact is really well done.I highly recommend the game, i repeat, for what it is. It's my humble opinion.And now my only ""great"" complaint:The game didn't work without tweaks.In my case: >>""Windows XP""<< (wow!), nvidia GTX570, intel Q9650, 4gb RAM.- The game works fluid with max settings, but once loaded the main in-game menu:> After 8-15s, the game tries to connect to internet, and i got kicked to the desktop with an application error window.The only solution i found myself is to block the game access to internet with my firewall. I don't know if it's a kind of protection, or check, or whatever thing it is, the only thing i can do to avoid be kicked to windows desktop is simply blocking the game access to internet.So i didn't tried multiplayer obviously :)After that, i got each 8-15s of in-game time, a pause of five seconds long. But ""ONLY"" when moving around in-game menus (yeah, it's like the game is sending/waiting for online info, and after some tries, it continues).Once started a match/tournament, the game is fluid, without interrupts/pauses.At least, i can play!> After each tournament final match, the game gives, again, an error to desktop.Solution: Not found. Just load / run again the game, and continue. The match results are saved before the error, thankfully.P.D: I hate to train after each match.Regards,Have fun!"

I know its not the best game but as a fight fan I've learned to lower my gaming standards when it comes to boxing, mma or kickboxing games.  I love how every KO the guy falls either like how Terry Etim did when he got KO'd by Edson Barboza or like Arlovski when he got KO'd by Fedor.  Also when u first start the game the punches might seem laggy but its not, your punches will get faster once u train your fighter more. I use a Xbox controller to play and it works great and the controls r real easy and preset with the buttons, Xbox buttons show up on the screen when it tells u to do a combo in training.  I hope they add some more content with an update that would be awesome.  Overall for the price its a good game and it will keep u playing it."

It keeps things simple and I'm not even a sports or boxing fan, but I enjoyed it.You get to make your own character basically, different apparal and you can do the basics of appearance change. For the price the fighting is good and the AI isn't bad. It's not a button masher, but if you wear the opponent down you can hook over and over til they are down, and it makes sense.Button mashing before wearing them down will not help, unless you are grossly overstatted above the opponent. Or above, them being worn down and too tired.My main complaint is after doing the three championships I have in interest in playing. The price, especially discounted, WAS worth it though. for 7-10 USD I got three hours of entertainment.

I really wish there was more and better boxer customization. There is no real variation in frame or facial structure. I can't play a slick, wiry bantamweight that looks like Rigondeaux - I have to look like competition-fit Kai Greene, with my choice of gear, facial features, and skin colour. You'd think that with how much variation there is in the build, height, and reach of boxers, it would at least be addressed in the game. But nope, every boxer uses the same re-skinned model.Graphical gripes aside, when I actually play it as I believe it was intended, Real Boxing is such a fun game. There are many elements to the strategy of boxing that they successfully incorporated game mechanics for. If you choose, every fight can be a chess match, with specific punches chosen to counter whatever they throw, fun and rewarding micro with timing headslips, and a range system that ends up modeling boxing footwork fairly well.Unfortunately, aspects of the game are broken -the stamina system and the stun / combo mechanic. These mechanics are supposed to reward skilled play; ideally you go in to trade 3 or 4 accurate and carefully chosen punches, then cover up and get back out of range. Unfortunately it is vastly more efficient to select the right perks and run forward while repeatedly jabbing your opponent to unconsciousness. Run at them, jab the guard until it breaks, jab them while they're stunned. Rinse, repeat. Boring.There is multiplayer and I have not yet dared. Who knows though, maybe amist all the cheese and jab spam, something resembling Real Boxing might happen."

No weight classes, which is wierdly offset by the attributes making an obscene difference from start to 100%. With a fully levelled up boxer no one with less than 98% will stand any chance of defeating you. Other boxers at 100% can be beaten soundly by making heavy use of the jab and dodge counter but are nearly impossible to beat by KO.Dodge counter is an odd mechanic and there is no parry. Body shots do very little damage compared to head shots.The AI will sometimes take an embarassingly severe beating and still get up 4 or 5 times (and ironically, during a REAL boxing match, a ref would stop the fight if a boxer was so badly outmatched).Overall a fun boxing game, worth the asking price, even better on special but won't take a great deal of time to finish it, and  replayability is quite low."

If this game was $60 or even $20 I would not recommend it, since the game is only $5 and is the only boxing game available on PC I can't really think of a reason to not recommend it.  My best advice if you get this game is play with a controller, I use a wireless Xbox 360 controller and the setup allows you to either use the right thumbstick and/or buttons to throw your punches.  This game can be slow if you don't watch your staminia.  It involves alot of going in throwing 3-5 punches putting up your guard and pulling back,  If you play your cards right in a match you can however pin your oppenent towards the corner or the ropes and throw a series of shots to the body.  This game can provide several hours of fun if you like boxing, use a controller, and take the time to learn the mechanics of it.

It's like someone having the right idea on how to make a cake and was on the right track until they f'd up the mix or burnt it. - Get it when it's on sale if you got about 4 hours to spend.I quite like the controls and the graphics are good enough but I do feel that a lot of stuff was missing considering it's a boxing game with the title """"""REAL"""" Boxing"" because there's really not a lot to this other than ""Fight five times. Do your strength, stamina and speed training. Buy some strength, speed or stamina"" rinse and repeat.WEIGHT DIVISIONS ARE MISSING:My first problem with the game is that there's no weight classes so i'm just assuming because a lot of punching is power punching, all it of it is Heavyweight. Weight divisions can change the game because you can be with the sluggish but powerful Heavyweights or be a light footed, fast moving Flyweight but no, you're just left to a one weight class set.TRAINING:This actually did annoy me a bit because they were on the right track and I really liked the training mini-games but you've only got threeStrength, speed and stamina.It's like ""come on, have some variety guys"" Endurance, practice moves to improve them.IT'S A NO-BRAINER:Go in and box, that's all your career is. Where's the management? There's no schedule and you don't really do anything in your career. Fight 8 times, have a championship match and ""oh, do you want this one deal? yes/no?"" and whatever you choose, it really doesn't have an effect on anything you do or have done; one choice gives you money, the other doesn't.I would have like to have seen an injury system so you have to be careful booking fights and being IN fights otherwise it can end your career early. A schedule calendar where you can book fights, manage signings for a new brand of boxing gear, attending a sport convention, accepting or declining movie/tv deals which effects your career time and a reputation meter so say you can choose to slag someone off on social media and that will get you bad rep or have post-fight decisions like ""shake his hand"" or ""talk trash"" which can lead you to being a good sport or a prick everyone boos at. Now I know that's being REALLY nit-picky because even big combat sport video games like Fight Night and UFC don't have a rep meter but with something called ""Real Boxing"" it would have been nice to see.CUSTOMIZATION:You can’t even change the name of your fighter. The hell? Your choice of boxing gear is very limited and because credits can be used on training you’re most likely to forget it exists because each item is like 500 credits so you’d rather spend it on training. To cut long story short: It doesn’t have create a fighter on it and also you can’t even edit the gear.So all I can say from this is: “It’s nice for it being a short game but the title was too bold a statement and there wasn’t much in the game so you’re best just getting it on sale when it’s like £1-£2.something”"

The graphics are great. The character creation is limited which is understandable considering this is not a AAA game. It has a decent career mode and training to impove your stats. It has a shop menu where you can buy items like boxing gloves, shorts and shoes. An excellent feature are the Perks which you can customize depending on your playstyle (e.g. lower stamina drain from hooks)As i said earlier, it has the basic boxing mechanics which makes the gameplay repetitive especially when you're up against tougher opponents which takes a longer time to defeat and having to do the same combo or dodging becomes boring. Because of this you can't develop a deeper and adaptive play style of being an in-fighter, out-fighter or a mixture of both. It could add powered punches (haymakers), step-in/out, side steps, specifics blocks and feints to remedy its limited boxing mechanics.
