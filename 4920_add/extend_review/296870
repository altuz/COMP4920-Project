,Recommended,296870,14876234,"Posted: 13 March, 2015",all,Kerma,"So after 100%ing this game and finding absolutely everything that you can do in 2 hours (would be under that if I didn't have issues with bugs, as the game just came out yesterday) I'm going to go ahead and recommend it but tell you a bunch of reasons why you shouldn't buy it if you're on the fence. Hang on while I explain.I personally think this game is well made. I had a prepaid mastercard with 5 dollars left on it, and I looked at ""recently released adventure games"" and saw this. Being a fan of Yume Nikki and other games like it (because honestly, it's become a subgenre at this point) I decided to take the plunge. Usually I wouldn't put money down on a Yume Nikki fangame type thing because they're usually uninspired and involve a lot of bad game design, but this looked well made based on the screenshots and sold me with the trailer music. It was 3 dollars on sale, so I figured at the worst I could sell the trading cards and make back ~50% of what I spent on it.First off: If you've played a Yume Nikki game before, this follows the formula to an almost funny extent.Dreams? ☑Looping levels? ☑Weird Alien things? ☑Drug references?☑Hospital Level?☑Creepy Eye Motif? ☑Viscera Level?☑Themes of questioning self and regret?☑However, if you haven't or the above doesn't bother you by being sort of done before (and I was ok with it, because it was done fairly well) then prepare for a weird platformer with great music and colourful graphics.Going to get the thing that might change out of the way: The game is horribly buggy. This is semi-excusable because I'm guessing this is this developer's first major release, and I'm making this review a day after it came out. The developer is in the discussion boards taking bug requests and trying to fix them, so this might change in the short future- but if you're buying this game at this very moment... Be aware!Dreaming Sarah is about a girl in a coma (which should be the game's only spoiler, but isn't considering it's both in the banner ad AND the description for the game) who is exploring her dreaming state. You walk around areas and find powerups to either help you, interact with other characters, or just to have for completionist's sake. The graphics are very pretty, the controls are fluent and simple (but not really instructed in game- I had to just guess what keys did what which only took a few seconds) and the music is relaxing and at times a bit haunting. As shown by my 2 hour play time and 100% achievement completion, the game is really short. Is it worth the money? Well, for almost 4 dollars you can't go wrong, but for 6? Ehhhhhh...Most games like this are free downloadable titles or flash games you can play, and if Dreaming Sarah was free, I'd be ridiculously impressed and recommend people to play it a bit more. But for more than 3 dollars? It's a fun experience, and if this is the developer's first game released, it's pretty great for what it is. But my main complaint with Dreaming Sarah is that ittakes away the essence of exploration usually found in games like this by making it a platformer and not adding enough content.There's nothing to find, no quirky secrets or easter eggs that have a 1/64 chance of happening (there are secrets in the game, but all of them are so close to the path you have to follow that I'd put money on you finding at least 80% of them without trying), and no real ""wow I can't believe how crazy this was!"" moments that is usually what makes playing exploration based walking simulators like this interesting. It plays it very very safe, and while it's enjoyable to sit down and relax with, it's not worth 6 dollars to play a game through to 100% for an hour and never touch it again.TakeJourneyfor example. It's 15 dollars on PSN, but it's an hour long. But many people claim it to be a great game for the price. Why? Because there's so much to explore and discover, and even when you're done with that you can meet people and have new experiences every time. With Yume Nikki, the gimmick is that while playing you always feel like there's something new that's happening- something weird that just randomly decided to show up. This game feels like an on-rails shooter in comparison, and while the atmosphere is very good, there's just nothing bringing me back.So all this being said, why am I recommending Dreaming Sarah? Well, on sale it's definitely worth it just for the experience, and I think the developer has a lot of potential in the future. The graphics are very eye pleasing (no pun intended) and the OST is pretty dang good (and you get it for free with purchase of the game) and if worst comes to worst you can sell the steam trading cards or keep them for a cool looking emoticon or background (most of them being well made, I'm wearing one on my profile at time of writing).Overall: 6.8/10"

,Recommended,296870,19360117,"Posted: 29 November, 2015",all,Lin,"A surreal little side scrolling adventure platformer, with minimal platforming elements and lots of exploration through weird but well made and definitely dream-like 16bit imagery.I'm slowly realizing that I'm bad at these exploration type games. There is a certain amount of patience required to get lost in its weird maps that go all over the place, in two directions or even looping onto themselves, and that require you to revisit them after finding certain items to see whether something new has unlocked. I'm apparently also not great at solving a couple of its slightly more abstract, lateral-thinking-required puzzles, so yes, a walkthrough was consulted. However, the game is good at creating a sense of controlled bewilderment that makes the exploration interesting, most of the puzzles do seem to resolve themselves after a bit of exploration or trial and error, and the different locations were distinct enough to keep fascinating even after getting lost in them for the n-th time. It helps that the game isn't particularly long (about 2-3 hours, depending on how lost you get), so frustration is kept at a minimum.I will avoid spoiling any of the discoveries you can make within its fragmentary (and admittedly not super original or particularly deep) story, because it includes some really interesting/shocking moments that carry the minimal, up-for-interpretation narrative forward. But I can say that Dreaming Sarah never got boring, because wandering through these dream sequences manages to stay refreshing throughout, with a new little surprise around every corner. The beautiful soundtrack also elevated the experience, and if you like this type of ambient, dreamy music, you will enjoy it.If you are even mildly curious about this game, and if you have the patience to get lost within its interesting surreal world, then Dreaming Sarah is definitely a game I would recommend. Despite not being the main target audience, I enjoyed myself. If you're still unsure about it, the Brazilian Indie Developer Asteristic is offering a downloadable demo at their websitehere."

I enjoyed interacting with the oddball characters and finding items scattered about to unlock the different ""worlds"" of Sarah's dream in order to advance the story, and the basic platforming elements worked well to enable my exploration.  It’s whimsical, mysterious and at times a little macabre.

While this is all quite plain it also is quite satisfying as the world has a dreamlike quality that makes moving through it very pleasing: the lack of direction can indeed be frustrating if you find yourself wandering aimlessly, but it also gives a sense of wonder that helps the game shine.The areas you travel through are often weird, sometimes disturbing and all'd feel right at home inside a dream, or a nightmare: this paired with the truly excellent soundtrack give the game a truly bizarre, ""trippy"" atmosphere that makes it an experience worth having.Dreaming Sarah might be a bit limited in terms of content and actual mechanics, but it's truly a small gem of a game due to how well it works and the sense of marvel it can evoke: I had a blast playing it and heartily recommend it."

As the developer have said, the title and game play is inspired by Yume Nikki, but with less randomness and a smoother pacing.The environment does change somewhat as you progress through the game, and there are enough stages to have a healthy variety, but it is all a straight linear affair.

As with these type of games you won’t find any replay value out of this, but in my opinion the money is well worth the time spent on it.The only downer is the ending, while there are two of them there is hardly any difference to warrant a second play through, to each their own though I suppose.If you by chance find this on sale, buy it right away."

The different zones were vivid and interesting.There were a few genuinely interesting/disturbing moments that were very much in the spirit of Yume Nikki.The bad:The creator acknowledges the inspiration was Yume Nikki. It borrows the plot, the tone, the protagonist, the gameplay. While the experience may seem fresh to those who haven't played, I found Dreaming Sarah akin to a mainstream recreation of Yume Nikki.Dreaming Sarah attempts to be artsy and mysterious while still having a simple, happy ending. Before the player starts the game, they've probably read the two-sentence blurb explaining that the protagonist is a girl trying to wake up from a coma. This was a hideous mistake that provides two major spoilers: the game is a dream sequence, and you'll probably wake up. I get why the creator wanted to do this: so ""normal"" gamers would play past the first five minutes. And yet this both spoils the ending and removes the dream world's mystique. If we know it's all dreamscape before even installing the game, we can write off all the imagery as a little girl's nightmare.Lastly, the protagonist was flat. Yume Nikki's protagonist was interesting because the player could probe her psyche and question her sanity as they navigated her dark dreams. Sarah took a more passive and indirect role. She never fights, breaks, or opposes anything. She silently accepts the plot coupons NPCs drop into her hands. She barely interacts with her own dreams, and never gives us reason to doubt her sanity.If you want a short, easy, tour through Wonderland that will leave you with your feet on firm ground, this game may be worth your while. Otherwise, there are games out there that do the artsy and psychological aspects a bit better. Check out Yume Nikki, Dear Esther, and Year Walk."

The open-ended world and imaginative visual design make exploring and discovering new areas feel rewarding and fun. The soundtrack is evocative and memorable - a great selling point on its own. The whole experience is uniquely immersive and atmospheric.It is clear a lot of love went in to making this game - I hope the developers will create more quality games like it in the future.
76561197995669628,Recommended,296870,30827937,Posted: 29 March,all,Sorokonojka,"Dreaming Sarah is what I would call an abstract exploration game because of metaphorical representation and unclear goals. The closest thing I can compare it too is Yume Nikki as far as artistic themes go. Even though this game is 2D, it is still reminiscent of ambient RPG maker games where exploration was done for the sake of exploration.Dreaming Sarah provides the player with emotional experience rather than extensive gameplay. The format is very interesting but many other games have already explored this concept.Plot impressionsIt is almost like 75% of the game has nothing to do with what happens toward the end. Even though it seems like a random game it leaves you bread crumbs to piece together what happened.  The ending is somewhat open to interpretation but it came together in a way which left me very curious. There were few moments that were shocking and yet most of the game felt very casual.My only criticism is that game should have been more consistent with tone.Gameplay & Obscure PuzzlesYou don't really need the skill to beat this game ( not that kind of a game ) However, I think it may be a little hard to figure out the next step especially when some objectives literally pop up in places that you already explored. I played a lot of games in a similar format so it was almost easy for me but your experience may be different. It is kind of logical but only in a sense if you think like a developer who is hiding things from a player. There is a nice variety of items that interact with puzzles and sometimes add new gameplay mechanics. You can 100% the game in 2-4 hours.Immersion, Atmosphere and Pixel artSo the meat of the game is about how much you enjoying the ambiance of the world. Pixel art is not remarkable but perhaps it is overly simplistic on purpose. I can't help but feel that backgrounds do not always match the tone of the story. There is not a lot of detail in the background which again makes it feel like a generic platformer when it clearly isn't.There are some events that will play with your mind although I have seen those in other games. To be honest I was not feeling the vibe of the game until maybe the last quarter when story pieces started to connect.Verdict 6.5/10Dreaming Sarah will probably appeal more to people who look for obscure exploration instead of a generic platformer. In my opinion, there are consistency issues with the tone of the game which take away some of the immersion (clashing tones is probably a good way to describe it). Overall this game had few shocking moments but felt mediocre for the most part. If you never played a platformer with more focus on atmosphere maybe you will get a unique experience from it . Personally, I have seen many ideas in this game associated with this ""genre"" which made it less impactful. I managed to enjoy it but would only recommend on sale."

Be prepared for walking in circles and running through its multiple scenarios quite a few times before figuring out what to do, as there is no map available. Could have been a downside, but it turns out to enhance the experience, for the game world is under constant minor transformations, and you never know for sure what you’ll stumble upon.The soundtrack is both smooth and mysterious, fitting perfectly with the overall surrealistic atmosphere. Pixel-art is well-made, although not outstanding. Total runtime shouldn’t exceed three hours, so I'd recommend playing it in one just sitting: some serious immersion will make this game all the more interesting (it’s supposed to be an one-night dream, after all)."

Although it's listed as a ""platform"" is not to be expected as the classics of the genre. The platforming element is only sketchy but the game system is best suited to bring out the eyes of the whole setting of the game. In fact, more than the plot that is rather hermetic, what really makes this indie a small gem are precisely the environments that, resonating of the beautiful musics, give to the player a surrealist experience. A game that I recommend to those who want to be transported in the absurd atmosphere of dreams and who is willing to get lost many times."

I can't really describe exactly why because to reveal the setting of an environment would almost be a spoiler in a game like this, but it definitely did a good job at making me feel the same way I did when I played Yume Nikki. If you enjoy games where surrealism is a main focus, or like games where you explore and discover unique environments, Dreaming Sarah is for you.A note though: As with many YN inspired games, the game expects you to eventually figure it out all for yourself through experimentation and revisiting. So if you're not a patient person and just want to go through it and have the experience rather than scratch your head and figure out where to go next, a walkthrough is recommended."

There also seemed to be a window period after any key press that didn't allow any further button presses for its duration.

Inspired by Japanese psychological/horror indie game Yume Nikki, it has a similar feel. Other than the obvious being that they are both exploration games taking place in a dream world, both have surreal music, at times disturbing art choices in character design, and a female protagonist with no dialogue. Also, both have artifact collection, with the game ending basically when you finish collecting all of them.Whereas I enjoyed this game, I did feel as though it was just a lighter, more simplified, version of Yume Nikki in a lot of ways. Although they share many characteristics, Dreaming Sarah lacked the same amount of depth, and did not do much in adding to the genre.That being said, the creator is upfront about it being a major source of inspiration for him, and there is at least one easter egg of Madotsuki's shirt's symbol on a bulletin board in one of the locations (there might be more, but I was giddy to find this one).For the price it's being sold at, I would recommend this game. It's fun, doesn't have any boring tutorials, and most of all is an experience in surrealism that toys with your psyche.Pros:- Gameplay was simple and easy to get into- Puzzles/exploration wasn't too dumbed down- Character and level designs were interesting- Good musicCons:- Didn't add anything to the genre- A little glitchy"

76561198061488151,Not Recommended,296870,33212584,Posted: 3 July,all,Pro Superstar,"What do I think about this game? Well...First off, the only part of the game that has any real meaning is the ending and one area of the game that you have to find an item at, which I shall not spoil. But I will say that why this item is in this situation makes no sense. Everything else is just Alice in Wonderland. Also, ducking is pointless. SPOILER ALERT:You're in a coma. But this is already spoiled through the game's discription. Only the secret (partially) explains why you're in a coma, and playing the game without reading the description doesn't explain this beforehand.Speaking of finding, that's a lot of what you have to do in this game.Finding things.Some objects must be found in order to advance, some of which have no significant meaning, such as the blockhead doll or the bag of seeds.I found out that the doll makes a grandfather clock appear that is used as a door to advance, but only because that was the one thing I needed to get any farther in the game. You need to make a leap of faith or be using the compass constantly in order to find it.Other items straight-up take you back to the first area, such as the bus pass, and are only useful for backtracking to find an item or tool you need. You could spam the compass to find what you need, but sometimes it will lead you into an area and stop working.I should probably clarify what tools are. Keep in mind that tools are different than items in that they are used by pressing space to access the tool menu rather than advance the game. They aren't called that in-game but I'll use that name here since there is no distinction.The way some tools are implemented is questionable. The umbrella, glasses, magnifying glass, watch, and paint bucket being in the tool menu are pointless because unequipping them downgrades your character. Let me explain each.The umbrella is an essential tool that allows you to fall slowly. Unequipping it cripples your character in most platforming situations.The glasses only make a single platform appear and allow you to find a secret. No reason to unequip them at all.The magnifying glass doesn't change the character's physics when used, so theres no real need to unequip it either.The watch only affects one, maybe two areas of the game, so there isn't any need to unequip it either.And finally, the paint bucket just cosmetically changes your character's colors and has no gameplay purpose.Remember how I said that you need to press space to access the tool menu? It is also used to toggle your tools on and off. This is irritating because sometimes you can press it a couple of times on accident to unequip the umbrella, which again, outright removes the ability to slowly fall, and is sometimes is a pain to reequip this necessary item or find out that it's unequipped when you need it. And the fact that space is the same button used to equip items and (from what I've played) there isn't any other way to get out of the tool menu, so you need to either select an empty tool slot, or use an item that you don't equip, such as the compass.Do I reccomend this game? I really wish there was a grey area, but I feel there isn't much justification to make a purchase with the above listed gameplay and ""story"" faults.You don't buy this game for challenge or story. You're buying an experience at best.EDIT: I should mention that I was able to finish this game in one sitting with the 106 minutes that is displayed in my library. You should probably get this in a sale for that length."
,Recommended,296870,18231994,"Posted: 27 September, 2015",all,Kaldrak,"Dreaming Sarah is an odd little indie platformer.It’s very hard to figure out exactly what’s going on in the game or what the premise is from the in-game content, but if you read the description, the game is about a woman in a coma named Sarah. You wander dream realms in an attempt to help her wake up.Alright, fair enough. So what exactly do you do in this game? You start out in a forest area and ‘wake up,’ though you have no real idea as to which way you’re supposed to be going. Pick right or left and start running. That’s pretty much it except for the jumping.Dreaming Sarah is a surreal game. The levels are connected to each other in strange and bizarre ways, but there’s no real rhyme or reason as to what they are or why you go to them. The gameplay is fairly freeform. Run around until you reach some obstacle you can’t get past and then find some way around it.As you play you collect various items, some of which are pretty darn cool. There’s an umbrella which slows your falling speed, a paint can which changes your outfit colors, a magnifying glass to shrink you down to tiny size to get through little tunnels, and even an item which transforms you into a fish so you can access an underwater level.In addition to all the useful items, there are a bunch of items which don’t do anything and whose significance to the plot is largely mysterious. Basically just collectibles, but strange ones. I have no idea why I was getting them or what the point of any of them are. Supposedly if you get all of them it makes the ending slightly different, but I took a look at the comparison between the two endings and it’s hardly worth it if you don’t collect everything.The main joy of the game is the atmosphere. The music is great and the artwork is retro styled, but very pretty. The levels loop back in on themselves, so if you go far enough right or left or even down, you’ll end up back where you started. There are NPC’s, but they don’t have much to say. Talking to them can be kind of neat and some of them have collectibles you can get from them.On the whole, Dreaming Sarah was an enjoyable experience for me. It is very short though. It only took me about three hours to beat it and collect every item and secret, almost all of which I found myself with no help. It’s not very difficult for a platformer and there are only a few ways to actually die, after which you instantly respawn, so it’s not for those looking for a challenge. The gameplay isn’t really the point though. It’s functional and there are some neat things you can do with the useable items.An atmospheric, enjoyable experience overall. I’d definitely recommend it if you have a few bucks and you want something neat."

You play as Sarah, and you’re dreaming (get it? Dreaming Sarah?). Sarah begins dreaming after she gets into a car crash and is put into a coma. We’d say that’s a spoiler, but it’s in the description of the game on Steam…so yah.The gameplay is inspired by Yume Nikki, but thankfully has some better gameplay elements, like plot. On your way of exploring this odd and bizarre little dream world, you’ll discover a colorful cast of characters, and explore odd but nicely detailed areas like a mansion, a lava world, and a never ending desert. You’ll start off in a forest section of the game, and slowly find more and more items along the way which help you get to other areas on other parts of the world. For example, you’ll find a magnifying glass which will help you get to other areas by shrinking yourself, or you’ll find glasses which let you see items you normally couldn’t see and so on. Some characters you come across also require certain items which will help you progress, while other characters are there simply for world building. One of the character we particularly found funny was a skeleton in the mansion area. During their text, we pictured them with voices similar to the Terry Pratchett animated movies. While some of the things you need for areas are obvious, it’s not entirely obvious or clear for others. For example, one character requires orange juice in order for the player to continue forward. However, it’s never really made clear the character needs orange juice. There’s also certain puzzles that we overthought in terms of complexity, when it was just one of those ‘we hadn’t done this, so that isn’t available yet’ types of puzzles. They’re in the game and annoying when they appear, but they’re not so annoying because you generally only find them when you’re about to or already have the required item. Some of the areas however you won’t need to access until a fair bit later into the game, like the Moon area. Despite this, exploring the areas and solving the puzzles was fun, and made the game fun to play as a way to winding down.The game tries to play like a bizarre platformer like Yume Nikki, but it plays far better than Yume Nikki for the most part. It’s less bizarre than Yume Nikki as a result of this, but it’s also easier to actually play.The only major parts of the gameplay to criticize is that there’s no real ‘dead’ stage to the game. You can fail at a puzzle or jump, but it never sets you back far enough to really consider it failing. There’s also the item problem where if you change into a fish and change back, all the items you previously had equipped you have to put on again. You also have a few items that you really don’t need to stop using except in certain situations. For example, you never have to really stop using the glasses you find or the magnifying glass to shrink you.The game itself is short, but it’s as short as it needs to be. It took us around three hours to beat the game, but we also got stuck on a few of the puzzles, so it’s really more like a two hour game unless you have a brains like ours which contain string and some peanut shells.Visually, it looks quite nice. Some of the character designs and inspired areas (ala the mansion is similar to the castle from Castlvania II) look nice, and everything somehow still flows visually, despite having very different looking areas. Sarah as a character looks a little too simple, but the extra animation on her hair when she jumps and moves is quite nice. We wish some characters had more dialogue with animations, but it’s nothing too substantial to really complain about. Visually, we wish they used higher quality visuals, but that’s it really. It looks ‘okay’ as is, but could be improved. The scene at the end with the sunset really looked low quality as well.The music is also really well done. It was fun to listen to, and (since the OST is free on Steam) we listened to it while writing this review. Some of tracks feel a little too simple, and little too low quality in terms of audio playback, but it’s certainly not a bad soundtrack by any means. It’s not quite the ‘listen to this while you work on something’ soundtrack like something from say, Bioshock or Fallout 3, but it fit the game just fine.The controls were also fine. Switching items is kind of a pain when you get more items, but it worked fine overall. The settings were also fine as is. The controls are rebindable, there are multiple graphics settings, audio settings, etc. It’s fairly basic, but we don’t think there’s much more it could have that it currently doesn’t. As for the game, it was fun, and we had fun. It was entertaining, and we got our $6.00 worth from the game. The puzzles are mostly older style adventure game early 90s style puzzles, but they weren’t nearly as frustrating as that, and mostly worked in a way you’d expect.Overall, it’s a simple but fun 2D retro-style platformer with some fun and triply little elements. We wish some characters had more dialogue, and we wish the game has better visual quality, but it’s still a fun game. We did run into some glitches , but nothing that deterred us from playing or finishing the game. It’s a short little platformer that we enjoyed.PROS- Colorful cast of characters- Well designed levels- Good controls and platformingCONS- Low quality visuals and random low quality backdropsScore: 7.9/10----------------------------------------------------------This is our full review for the game, the only difference between the Steam review and the one on our website, is we have pictures and text is easier to read and what not.

I found myself to be a big fan of the game's pixel art and soundtrack that ranges from very chill to haunting or disturbing. There is a big problem, however: it's only about an hour long. I feel like I saw most everything there was to see in the game within this hour, and I managed to beat it at that. I admit that if I payed the full price rather than getting this game on sale, I would have been upset.I have to reccomend this game, but know that you're buying more of a short little piece of art than a game that'll keep you playing for a long period of time.

Within, you'll find things you'd only find in dreams - magical beans that can make upward drafts, mansions with things that can only be seen with special glasses, and the ability to turn into a fish. You'll only receive small snippets of story as you explore the area.The platforming in Dreaming Sarah is pretty well done. While playing on controller it felt pretty responsive. Switching around items can be a pain at times, and you may often find yourself deactivating your parasol when you accidentally open the menu. There is a large amount of backtracking to do in the game, but it does generally push you along in the right direction.While I do highly recommend Dreaming Sarah to those who like puzzle platformers, I only give that high recommendation if you can get it on sale.

,Not Recommended,296870,16861061,"Posted: 3 July, 2015",all,duncanarchib,"Dreaming Sarah is unfortunately a disappointment. The visuals and music are both quite pleasing, but they're attached to an essentially mediocre puzzle platformer. The puzzles themselves are generally simple to solve, but are throttled by tedious back-tracking and slow-paced exploration. The platforming itself is a chore with no challenge. At under 2 hours for completing all achievements, there isn't a whole lot here, but unfortunately by the end it already felt too long. Most of that time was spent running back and forth through the same areas, which lost much of their charm in the process. There are shortcuts revealed throughout, as well as an item that can teleport you back to the start, but even with that, traversing the small map areas becomes tedious. There's not much story to get involved in; the dibs and drabs of text that come out are largely disjointed and don't form any sort of narrative. Given that the game is a dream sequence that could be forgiven; if there were more to the game itself then the lack of story or character development wouldn't be an issue. Some older reviews mentioned technical issues. I didn't find any in my play through. I would like to point out that there is an umbrella in the game that lets you float around, which is needed for some puzzles but can be used everywhere. It's a pretty enjoyable enjoyable mechanic, and jumping and floating through each stage is the one nice break from the tedium.As I said before, the art and sound are both nice, and are what initially got me to make the purchase. But nice visual design and soundtrack can't make up for the flaws in the actual game. I bought it on sale for under $3, but unfortunately even if it were free I would have been displeased, as the time spent was not really worth it."

None of the puzzles are hard, but the game is still fun and bizzare. The soundtrack is relaxing and draws you in to the experience. I got this title on sale for a pittance and I believe now after having finished it that the full price might have been close to worth it for this game. Other games I've played and finished recently in a somewhat similar vein would be Anodyne and Another World, though it's actually hard for me to compare any game I've played to this one. Anodyne has a similar flavor to the kinds of secret areas you find and Another World has a somewhat similar ""otherworldly"" feel to it. I dunno, some might disagree. One last positive about this game is that I have 100% achievements for it, which was pretty easily attainable, and you can get 3 out of 5 trading card drops by playing. 8/10 score for the amount of times I found myself saying, ""Oh, weird."""

It has a lot of charm being an indie game, and the music is perfect for the different settings. However, there are certain parts and things that should have been looked at to prevent repetition and have less waiting time, and the compass was worthless sometimes. Why have an item that helps you find items but take away its purpose in certain areas? Also, it would have been nice to pick up where i left off at when i save and quit, rather than putting Sarah back at the very beginnning. The exploration is amazing nostalgic similar to the first Zelda game for NES as you never knew what spoils were waiting in every room.  Overall, a charming game that is worth a look, but some of the mechanics aren't actually casual friendly being a casual game and ruins the flow you make for yourself and adds a bit of frustration that should not be in the game."

Though there are great guides out there to help you do this in the correct order.

Sure it was a cheap indie game, but I do get a lot of them and found some great ones over time.The game starts with you waking up, on the grass. The game tells you the basic comands but never gives you any hint as to where to go or anything. OK so you can go to either side right? But then, depending on the side you go first, things on the other will just be skipped (like I just found a fishing pole standing straigh up, but aparently, there should be a person fishing who would tell about an item that I already had found). Than you start walking around and suddenly find out that most maps are circular in a way, so if you go always to the same side you should end up back at the start (if you have the required items, that sometimes happen to be on the other side...).Then the problems begin: there ar quite a few repeated backgrounds, like sometimes you walk a full 3 screens with nothing to do but kep walking (not even a jump or anything), no colecting objects, no obstacles, nothing.I knew it was somehow about a little girl in a coma, but just because I read the store page, for all the game tells you she could be just dreaming at night or she could be in some king of wonderland.Some of the items you pick are quite useful (like the umbrella) and some had no use at all (like the paint bucket that changed her clothes color, never found a reason to use it).After a while playing I had no idea where to go, what to do or anything. And was bored from navigating repetitive screens with not much chalenge and no story at all. (c'mon a little boy who says ""thanks for returning my hat, now I can go home"" and disappears is no story and that's the most someone talked to me and no cuscenes or reactions ever shoed any fragment of story at all)So buy it if you enjoy walking around aimlessly, collecting items that might make some sense or you might just carry them around without using for ages."

WTF IS THIS GAME?This game seems to me like some emo chick sat at a computer after getting high and said, ""you know what would be soooooooo cool, making the best saddest game ever!"" After which they proceeded to create this mess.This game is all over the place and as a result you are left bewildered in the end. Was she shot, did she get in a car accident, did she hit children with her car and attempt suicide, what, what, tell me, what is it! But the game never ever does explain itself.The visuals are mediocre at best. In fact on a lava level my chick thought I was playing Super Mario Bros, lol. I told her what the game was and she replied by saying they ripped of Super Mario Bros. It was then that I realized she was right. This game seems to take levels from other platformers, the forest level, the water level, the dungeon level, the dessert level, the other planet/moon level. All this stuffs been done before and with greater effect.The controls are fine and you can use a controller which I did like.But would I recommend this game? Nope, probably not.The bottom line is this, if you are looking for an exciting adventure or a compelling storyline then you will not, I repeat, ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT FIND IT HERE.If however you are an achievement hunter and would like to earn 22 achievements in 2 incredibly boring hours, then this may be the game for you."

It doesn't do cutscenes to show you when a new area/item/person has appeared so it's up to you to check everywhere.I played using Steam Link and an Xbox 360 controller. I had no problem with it displaying correctly using Steam Link. I did however have an issue thinking the 360 controller wasn't going to work with the game but it does. When you are at the start screen press the Y button and than the controller should work as expected. I don't know if you'd need to press Y first when playing directly on your PC since as I said, I was playing through Steam Link.I got all the Achievements but two on my initial play thorugh and after loading up my save file I found the two I was missing in a few minutes. I tend to try to explore everywhere so if you are that type of person you'll probably have a similar experience.As long as the being dropped in a world and not being told what to do doesn't bother you I'd highly recommend the game. If that is not something you think you'd normally like you may still enjoy it as it isn't a long game and the world isn't overwhelming large.All in all just a relaxing enjoyable experience."

(included in the purchase)The sceneries itself vary nicely from absolutely psichedelic to normal to scary or alien saving the game from ever getting visually dull.Due to how short this game is I don't feel right recommending it at full price, but if you like the genre (atmospheric puzzle platformer) I would definitely recommend to put it on wishlist and wait for the first sale."

I felt like I just collected objects for the sake of wandering aimlessly while collecting objects. You wake up in the middle of a cool mysterious forest at the beginning of the game and meet some interesting characters, but there are only a handful of clues that help explain how you got there in the first place, and the ending was just meh. I enjoyed the retro-NES-type sound effects, but what I liked most was definitely the music. I would give the soundtrack a thumbs up."

If you are interested in action and highly engaging/action-oriented gameplay then no this game will probably bore you to tears. However, if you like figuring out the game yourself, and piecing a story together through environmental queues then yes this game is definitly worth taking a look at. The game is generally good at giving you a sense of progression. You almost always know what to do next or have an idea of what to look for. Even when you backtrack, you feel like there is something new to discover in these old areas (because sometimes there are ;) ). During this whole thing I felt like I got a sense of what kind of story was happening, yet I found it interesting that the game was abstract enough that anyone could interpret the queues in numerous ways. My only gripe is that there are some areas and items that you may have to look up a guide for. In my game it took a while for me to find the doll, and I would have never found the sea level if I didn't look up a walkthrough. Overall this game is worth getting (especially now cuz its only 60 cents), it's only two hours but I really was entertained in that amount of time. Plus the music is A+ imo."

,Recommended,296870,31672483,Posted: 10 May,all,malaisling,"A simple and neat little game that rewards exploration with various quirky secrets, eventually ending in a humble and understandable twist.Although at times it required unnecessary levels of backtracking, walking and occasional trial-and-error; the game also does not make much effort to be inventive. It features relatively basic and rudimentary mechanics which have been done many times before, but for a small game it is still satisfying.However, the game only spans up to two hours if the player tracks down all the secrets. Which is not very reasonable for the price considering how simplistic it is."

,Recommended,296870,31886667,Posted: 21 May,all,Giu,An amazing game. It really reminds me of Yume Nikki save that it is easier to explore and follow. It's very calming and I love the music. There's no real narration but the way it shows the story is lovely and the hints that allow you to piece together the truth about the player and what goes on in her psyche. A lovely game for a nice couple hours of exploring and gentle gameplay

The game is not terribly long (I 100% the game in about two hours), and the areas aren't Metroidvania levels of expansive, but the variety of places to see and the overall chill atmosphere of the game makes Dreaming Sarah worth playing through at least once. Worth picking up if you're looking for a kind of breather game to play in your downtime or something."

Like Yume Nikki met a 2D platformer... dreamy, like Alice Mare, and a touch insane too. I found just getting lost in the environment part of the charm. At the start, you're overwhelmed by the sheer amount of explorable space, but as you progress it seems to become so much more navigable. The main character, despite never speaking, really grows on you as you fill in the blanks of her character. A game hasn't really made me want to have a chat with the director about the design choices quite like this one has!"
