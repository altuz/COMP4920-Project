76561198050219817,Not Recommended,296910,12798366,"Posted: 4 November, 2014",all,Javuto,"This game appears to have all the elements that would make it fun, but it's faulty mechanics and a ton of other stuff just ruins the fun.It is a very hard in all the wrong ways; very punishing and somewhat repetitive.I'll try to justify why I'm not recommending it, since it seems like a lot of work was put into the game and the dev updates it regularly, which tells me at least he cares.First about the levels.Within each world some levels are super hard but others are a walk in the park. Specially if you are just shooting for the end without exploring. Having branching paths and secrets is ok, but have your main level be interesting as well. That's just like making an RPG have awesome side quests and a bad main story. Side quests are a bonus, not the main stuff, it's like the topings on an ice cream.Variety is also an issue, each world has a lot of levels, but they all feel like the same level with rearranged stuff. Each world introduces some new baddies and graphics, but they are not well distributed or introduced.Also, levels are long but they don't flow right, I find myself a lot waiting idle for a monster to get out of the way or a moving platform to reach me. Or sometimes the opposite, for example on the flooding levels, where you ""escape"" water that rises, since it expects you go down the bazillion secret paths, if you just follow the main level the water is never even close to you. This just tells me the levels were not really planned much, stuff was just thrown there. I would much prefer fewer levels but better planned than a ton of levels all the same.The enemies don't follow any ""consistent"" pattern, they move, jump and shoot whenever they want. This extends to other stuff, for example one of the enemies throws a big snowball that sometimes hits the wrong pixel and rebound on a different direction from where it was supposed to go. This happens with a lot of stuff including the bosses, they rebound against the walls in a weird fashion when they jump.You die because you can't predict stuff, it's just twitch reactions a lot of the time or simply impossible to dodge.I'm honestly not sure if this is related to framerate or whatever, but it's just an ingredient for a bad plaformer.Consistency is what makes these kinds of plaformers fun (at least the ones this game is trying to emulate). On most games from the NES/SNES/Sega era, the enemies and the enviroment reset on each life, and always move the exact same way when you respawn, so you can learn the level. This way when you die you know it was your fault.Moving on to glitchy stuffHitboxes are weird. Sometimes you don't properly hit platforms or pass through them.Solid blocks and non-solid blocks look the same.Some of the background can be confused with platforms.Breaking squares from below also behaves badly, sometimes you have to hit squares twice or more.Throwables from enemies go through stuff. I was hit a couple of times by one of the small snowballs from an enemy I wasn't even seeing on the screen.Finally, my biggest issues, several game mechanics are bad:Level exploration is super punishing. On my playthrough I was going through levels in a straight line to the finish. Levels are super hard already without exploring, and exploring is just pointless, any benefit is crushed by the fact that any mistake and it's back to the start without power ups. Exploring stops being fun after the 30th death, where you have to redo the entire level from the beginning, while also loosing the power up. Risk is not worth it just to get a couple extra coins.The power up system is very unbalanced. The game doesn't know if it wants to be a shooting plaformer or a jumping plaformer, and the mix is not well done. A power up makes enemies super easy, but no power up makes them a nightmare. You are massively underpowered without a power up. And, let's not overlook the fact that, if you don't have one, you die in 1 hit. So you can't shoot, but you also insta-die, it's the worst and not well balanced.Levels don't help at all, some enemies are even impossible to kill by jumping, for example the birds that fly high and shoot at you. If you compare this to super mario for example, the difference is that in super mario the main focus was jumping, and you could finish all levels just with small mario, the flower was just a ""nice to have"". And if you compare to most shooting plaformers the difference is that you already start with a gun or have means to handle enemies other way. In this game the balance is bad, and you start with nothing each time you die....Last, the lives are just worthless. The fact that, loading the save restores your power up when entering the level, just makes it better to have 1 life with a power up and get a game over on each death. Also, harvesting lives is horrible. If you are going to make a game inspired in old games, bring only the good stuff, not the bad. In any case, harvesting lives doesn't work here, because A) it's super hard so you would need like 2000 lives B) there isn't any fun level to quickly get lives C) on each death you loose the power up D) it's better to get game over and continue than having livesThe rant ends here, these game mechanics were the last thing that ruined it for me, but they could be fixed with changes like:Adding checkpoints would encourage exploration. Super nintendo games added them for a reason. If you want to keep the difficulty, you can do something like Shovel Knight or Bit Trip Runner 2 where you have the option to break or skip the checkpoint if you want.For the power ups the easiest would be to make the shield be a default on death, and make the first pickup be the red berries. An alternative would be to better balance the levels for when you don't have any pickups. Since right now it's a death sentence.The behavior on death should be the same as loading the last game or something similar. I would just get rid of the lives system entirely. The game could keep track of the deaths but have them be meaningless except for points or something."

The story is about a older gamer growing up not being as educated as alot of folks are now a days. So he remembers his childhood playing video games and having fun. While going to his basement he finds his old console, and a game thats un labeled. When plugging it in he suddenly is transported to the Gaming World. Nice Game pick it up for the sale price its $7 right now. Worth the purchase.. I dont think its as hard as say Super Meat Boy but its a great challenge."

76561198010567652,Not Recommended,296910,12390601,"Posted: 6 October, 2014",all,T-Buster,"At first glance, I wasn't especially impressed with 8BitBoy, but a few of the reviews were positive and the game was heavily reduced in price so I thought I'd give it a go. To its credit, it does evoke a sense of nostalgia; the visuals and music are very reminiscent of a Genesis/SNES game (thus making 16BitBoy a more appropriate title, but that's splitting hairs). The graphics are simple and cartoony, everything is brightly-coloured and you can clearly see what is an enemy, what is a powerup, a platform, etc. The game's presentation is fine.However, in an attempt to emulate some of the classic platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit eras, I feel that 8BitBoy has not quite hit the mark in terms of quality gameplay; your character seems to slide around very easily, almost as if every level were an ice level. I've also noticed that the main character's hitbox when it comes to platforming is smaller than its sprite; classic platformers like Mario and Sonic allowed you to land your foot on the edge of a platform and be fine, yet in 8BitBoy you had better make sure you land square on a platform, otherwise you're likely to fall and die.Death is another problem with this game. Lives are in short supply, and the levels have no checkpoints. Granted, they're not really long enough to warrent them, and there is little downtime between dying and respawning. However, because of the aforementioned hitbox detection, death is very likely. And the power-ups you'll have collected (which amount to a series of slightly different projectile attacks), will be lost. There is a plus-side to this; the game autosaves at every level, keeping track of your lives total and power-ups when you enter a level. Hence, when you get a game over, you can restart the level with everything. However, this completely invalidates the point of having extra lives. If I die in a level and lose all my power-ups, why would I want to play the level without them, when I can just suicide until I get a Game Over and restart the level with my arsenal intact?I can't really say I can recommend 8BitBoy. I've not played it long, but the brief period I've spent trying it has been enough to dissuade me from ever playing it again. I would say the developer has their heart in the right place, but I feel they have more lessons still to learn from the classic platformers they clearly idolise. A solid attempt, but that is all."

Still good with a Mario spirit.Longer: Although I'm by no means done, I'm already happy with my purchase of 8BitBoy. The creator posted on r/gaming about how happy he was that his game was greenlit, and the price was right for a game that looked decent. Thankfully, the game is as decent as it looks!8BitBoy is heavily inspired by the early Mario games, complete with floaty physics. They work just fine, although I wouldreallylike a WASD option for keyboard users such as myself. Not having that option is my biggest qualm with the game, since it's how I play every other computer platformer ever. I cannot report in on how it works with a controller as I do not have one.My biggest praise for the game is how different types of enemies attack in different ways, and how exploration is a big focus of the game (even early on). I could see it being played in a meandering 100% completion style, and also speedrun. That's a big plus. Unfortunately, the enemies are also one of my causes for complaint -- they're rather fat, which makes them take up an awkward amount of space. This is a problem when they die, since they're not knocked off the screen like in Mario, but rather their bodies persist for a while. It makes the world feel unnecessarily cluttered in my opinion.I recommend this game for people who liked oldschool Mario, and/or who enjoy simple platformers with a lot of possible exploration."

While the game unashamedly barrows from said title (not to mention a number of other classic platformers), 8-Bit Boy nonetheless manages to please. Ironically, it is because it harkens with such transparency back to many-an-old-school side-scroller that this title is such a surprising joy to play.The controls are very good--much better, in fact, than many of the games from which it models itself. Level-design does not disappoint either; while simple, they are all just about the right length and offer some pretty rewarding treasures for those adventurous enough to explore all the nooks and crannies. In fact, once you have beaten the game, you are able to select any stage in order to collect anything you may have missed on your first path.The difficulty gets kind of steep in places (I had to resist a rage-quit or two), but it is not so brutal that the challenges cannot be overcome with a little persistence. Keeping at this one and making progress turns out to be very rewarding, and the bosses are fun to tackle and put away.The soundtrack, while not mind-blowing, is a notch above serviceable, making it plenty good for this sort of outing. The composer certainly succeeds in capturing the old-school tunes of yesteryear, which actually get to be rather catchy after awhile rather than annoying.Graphically, the game appears a ""bit"" archaic, but since every ingredient in 8-Bit Boy is designed to evoke late-80's gaming, they are perfectly suitable.I have returned to old games like Super Mario Bros., Mega Man, and Donkey Kong Country again and again. 8-Bit Boy is like any of these titles in the sense that it can be enjoyed more than once on account of it being well-designed, fun, and relatively short--especially once you get dialed back into the ""twitch-thumb"" playing you used to do while sitting in front of the old cathode ray tube, Nintendo controller in hands.So if you have a hankering to revisit those crusty-old NES cartridges, you might want to grab this inexpensive game as an appetizer. You likely won't be disappointed."

Most notably, you'll feel elements of Super Mario Bros., Alex Kidd, and Hudson's Avdenture Island show up throughout the game.So overall, I'd say I very much appreciate the game. Here are some of the reasons why:- The controls are pretty solid, and controller support was hassle free with an Xbox360 controller.- Secrets and hidden stuff everywhere- Levels are long enough to be a challenge, but not too long that they become tedious- Music and sound effects fit very well with the 8-bit style- Pays respect to the games of yesteryear without directly trying to clone any one single franchiseI'd reccomend this game on or off sale, but for less then a dollar during the Holiday sale, I feel I got a great deal."

76561197998849577,Recommended,296910,10428963,"Posted: 11 June, 2014",all,MortalBeing,"Being a gamer since the days of the Intellivision and Atari, when 8BitBoy's screenshots first graced themselves across my monitor, it became one of those games I was happy to throw my money at. It looked like a Mario clone and for the most part it is. The retro platforming aspect is here in full force, the puzzling element is thrown in and multiple ways to complete the level presents itself nicely. There is also much exploration and fun to be had.Each of it's five worlds consist of nine levels and a final boss level.  The backstory personally spoke to me as I could easily relate. The controls are out of the days of the Nintendo and C64. 2 buttons to control firing and jumping if you prefer and a directional pad to move around. For the most part the game performed and responding to my commands decently. I found a gamepad to be easier and more responsive then the keyboard.  Like in Mario and so many other platformers of that bygone era, you spend your time avoiding various enemies, collecting coins and bonus trinkets. Powerups are smartly scattered around the level, making you have to use your noggin as well as your trigger finger to get at them. There are also many secret areas enclosed within each level. Each level also contains a save token for you to find, once you do, you can continue the game from that level with whatever your current specs were when you found the token.This game is not easy by any means. The programmer dares you to beat it and it is a challenge to do so. The difficulty levels are erratic and vary greatly even amongst same world levels. For example I found level 4-8 to be extremely difficult if not downright frustrating while level 4-9 was hard but enjoyable.Overall, I enjoy this game but it brings me to the one fatal issue I am having with it. It has to do with the constant updates. This in itself, is an extremely good thing and the creator is repsonding to many ideas that players have had. That is where my problem lies. To me, this says this was a somewhat unfinished early access game in disguise. When I purchased this game many of the features that are being added were not included. I don't mind one or two updates to fix bugs, but aside from some bugs there are constantly features being added and I am not sure this game would warrant another playthrough to see them.  For example, speed running and warps were added when I was already upto world 5. All of this should have been implemented before a full program launch. Otherwise, it should have been labeled as early access which it clearly wasn't. If you are a fan of achievements, you should also know that they are not here as of this writing.Still, the constant additions aside, this is a fun game and well worth a $6 asking price. But if you are not a fan of early access, you might want to put this on your wishlist and hold off for a month or two so you can play a completed game."

I tried the hard difficulty and died like all the time so i played the easier one and lemme tell you its still hard!! Its scary when you jump to a platform not knowing if it will dissapear or jumping to a wall and go through it and think oh no I just died only to discover its a secret! Btw some of these secrets arent even safe. It may have a special coin but in order to get it you have to jump over enemies and spikes- hmmm risk my life fr that damn coin or come back later-yep im coming back later sowie coin lol. Enemies are easy to kill but they trick you-dont want to spoil their moves but lemme tell you that just because you think they wont hit you and think that you are safe-well you are not! I like the music especially world 4- reminds me of old school vid-game soundtracks! Theres also tons of collecting to find but to find those special coins is hard as heck because sometimes you have to be quick-or face dangerous situations and risk a life in order to get that coin! I will say I think the character can sometimes be kinda floaty when you run and jump- like hes landing on ice. Its makes your heart skip a beat thinking wow I almost fell in the pit! I do like the powers which there is 3 versions of and a shield! Gripe about the powers tho is that if you get hit once- you lose it- it be better if you got hit and lost the black suit and went to the green and then got hit again and went down to the red but I suppose that adds to the difficulty! Plus its harder to save on the hardmode version of the game as opposed to easy mode where it saves after every level which is welcomed because lives are hard to come by. I like this game tho and it takes me back to mario days of past! Stumbling into secrets and the cute music and figuring out the boss patterns is fun! It never gets to want to break laptops screen hard. I would highly recomend it if you like platformers- a challenge- are a collector junkie and just love nostalgia! Buy it!!

Not only is it incredibly fun and extremely reminiscent of the original 'Mario Bros' for Nintendo, but it's also tough as nails. Which brings up the age old question; is a platformer really that good if it never makes you contemplate smashing your controller? If you answered no to this question, then proceed to the checkout page for you are about to purchase this game.Perfectly timed jumps, relentless enemies, easily lost power-ups, and boss battles that continue to get harder; '8BitBoy' has everything that you would come to expect from a sidescroller and more. Which is hard to come by in a time where many games attempt to re-create a wonderful 8 bit experience, but end up falling flat in the end. In fact, '8BitBoy' feels like one gigantic homage to platformers in general, and playing through it you're sure to notice plenty of elements from the classics.Not only is this one of the best platformers out, but it's constantly being updated, so there's always something new to discover. If you're a fan of games like 'Super Meat Boy', 'Shovel Knight', or pretty much any platformer in general, this game is worth checking out a million times over. Here's hoping that '8BitBoy' gets a sequel sometime soon, but even if it doesn't, I'm sure I'll return to this one time and time again anyway. Happy jumping!"

Some of the levels can be challenging and the boss fights at the end of each world become more challenging the farther you get into the game. The description says 16+ hours for the story I technically only delved straight to the level and world completion and not other aspects per level and once I beat the last world I had clocked in 7hr50min. I loved finding secret areas some of them caught me off guard and I was like no way could have sworn I was going to die. All in all I think once I go back and try to get everything in the game I will be at 20-30+ hours on record for Steam.Pros:Good platforming challenges.Has a decent pace to each level did't feel rushed.Nice boss fights with different mechanics per fight.Good progression of difficulty per world from level to level but doesnt hold your hand.Controller Support I love games that have controller support especially ones I don't have to rebind the keys.Cons:I think the only issue I had which is very small was the music felt repetative(Like it was re-used level to level) and to be honest it isn't bad thing just some of the beats are stuck in my head haha.Another thing that I would like to see in this game is achievements.All in all I think the game was well designed and I appreciate the developer updating as much as they can to make sure you don't have preformance issues. For $4.00 you really can't say 16-30+ hours of gameplay isnt worth it alot of AAA titles that come out now are $60.00 and only last half the time. If the game goes on sale there should be no reason you don't purchase the game.

It's questionable, the problem is it's awkward and doesn't seem to fit how you move. And there isn't any checkpoints, before you say i'm casual scum let me just say that some of the levels just drag on too long and there is extremely hard parts and trail and error♥♥♥♥♥♥going on. And sometimes the game just ♥♥♥♥s up. 5-7 theres a part when you jump and by some wierd voodoo magic you get propelled to the right overshooting your jump.

I like how the creators have put efforts in it through the drawings but also into the design of their levels. The game's sometimes difficult at some points, but nothing to stop you from playing. You've got some hidden areas for more coins, shortcuts, power-ups and many levels to play, even bonus ones.No need to tell you that it's very very similar to Mario platform games, but so far from what I played, I see that the gameplay isn't totally similar to Mario games.It's clearly not the game of the year, but for the price it goes at, I'd suggest trying it. :)Have fun!"

I'm kind of in the same place too with my game design aspirations. But I digress. 8BitBoy has some issues, but there is one that REALLY sticks out to me. The plaforming controls. At first glance, they're pretty decent. But the more you pplay, the more you notice their lack of...fluidity. As a matter of fact, I've tried running left and jumping, and found I downright can't! Or at least some of the time. Either way, this is a mistake that needs correcting. Maybe you could try retooling the platforming engine, or algorithms, or whatever you would call it, to make movement a little more fluid too.The next one is only a suggestion, and would require you to throw a bunch more effort in, so I can't honestly expect you to go along with this, but I'd love to see this in effect. Could I suggest that the Hard mode of this game include more difficult enemy patterns? I mean, the time constraints and the secret coin save points are nice, but it doesn't really feel like you're missing out on anything that the normal mod had to offer. Perhaps updating enemies with things like having the normal birds have short bursts of speed at certain intervals in time, or giving the flying black birds some sort of missile to drop on the player could really spice up the experience and give people who played the Normal mode something really worth coming back to? It's just an idea that stuck with me since I experienced it in a game called Hero Core (brilliant game, by the way. If you're interested in finding out what I'm talking about, you can find it here:http://sandbox.yoyogames.com/games/125836-hero-coreIt's completely free to play).Maybe you might already be working on your next big project, but if not, I'd say that it might be worth coming back to."

It doesn't try to do anything unique or pretentious.  It does one thing and one thing only - be a solid 2D platformer.You will have to realize the controls may borrow concepts from classic Mario games, but they follow their own ""rules"".  This was something I had to shake from my ingrained muscle memory of playing tons of Mario games - for example, running does not make you jump higher - longer yes, but higher no.This makes some level designs mildly annoying, since it's obvious some levels were made exclusively to limit you because of these jumps.  There will be jumps where you just won't be able to make it because of a one block difference, and you're forced to either go around a long way just to reach that jump or use some other means to get there.  Super Mario games had a lot of these, but the level designs for those games didn't feel as... obvious as the levels in this one.The enemy designs are kinda funny, strangely satisfying to stomp on enemies that look like Angry Birds.  It's like the author knew that people who like these older retro style games have a bit of a dislike for what the ""Angry Birds"" genre of casual mobile games have caused for the video game industry.Regardless, if you want a few hours of fun, there's way worse things you can spend your money on.  There's lots of Youtube videos you can look up if you want first impressions of the game, and it's highly recommended you use a controller for an optimal playing experience, seeing how this game harkens back to the console platforms of old."

I haven't 100% the game yet, but I doubt it'll take me another 14+ hours to do that.The game is quite friendly up until the final world, then it starts being a bit more... pesky. A few too many ""Oh, you missed one out of seven jumps, here's a pit of death."" areas in that world. The rest is fine though.Apparently there's a story in here as well. You're a 30 (I think) something guy, who misses the good old days of playing video games, so you go down into the basement to pick up your old Sega (I assume, due to one mention of Genesis later). You find a cartridge with no label, that doesn't look like it's ever been played, which is scary so obviously you have to play it. Plug it in, and boom, now you're a video game character. (Think Captain N, only slightly less cool.)Finally, is the game any good? Yeah, definitely. It was really fun, a really nice throwback game. If you like classic platformers, odds are you'll like this one. In my opinion definitely a throwback to some Atari and Amiga games, more than NES and Genesis/Mega Drive games.

The game itself, it took me 11 hours fully complete the levels and to find all the hidden stars on each level, but you can't complete the story until you find all 50 stars, 1 per map, so that resulted in me running through all 50 levels again to finish the game. I was then going to run it on the 'EXTREME' difficulty, but the only difference is you have to collect the coins to save your game, instead of it saving after completion of each level, and you get slightly less time.

But keyboard input is also just fine.Alright with that out of the way, I found that this game is well worth the price of four dollars, but you can see by my saying that that it's really not that exciting of a game. I would almost say it's better for children, but I believe the original classics are all around a better choice.The market is disgustingly lacking in simple retro platformers. Almost all of them feel rushed or just simply lack that charming excellence of Mario 3 or Sonic. This one feels sort of like the graphics are over-done, and the gameplay is under-done.

It's fun for a few minutes at a time, but eventually grinds on your nerves with it's lack of overall polish. It's sprites and tiles are as drab and boring as it's forgetful grating chiptunes soundtrack; it simply lacks polish that other games in it's genre offer. What 8BitBoy does have going for it is it's skillfully executed level design which simply keeps the game together as a whole. Overall, you're getting all the polish in the game that the dollar you payed with offers.There were things I both liked and disliked about 8BitBoy that you should take into consideration before buying:+ Collecting 100 coins gives you a roulette that cycles through all the powerups in the game. You can hold this item and use it when desired, similar to holding an item in ""Super Mario World"".+ Branching paths in the level design often reveal hidden secrets which reward you for exploration, some of which allow you to “warp” to other worlds, skipping entire parts of the game.+ Can jump on enemies to kill them!- Powerups consist of a fireball, or fireball, or another fireball.- Has a single cutscene that's shown before the start of a new game; albeit, not animated and is told via a wall-of-text in slides.- Has a tutorial that's you're forced to play.- Pausing the game forces awkward navigation. Instead of navigating up and down with arrow keys or joysticks, you must navigate manually moving the mouse cursor to select the option you want, regardless of using a mouse.- You lose ALL your powerups you've carefully been saving if you take a single hit, or die.- A lot of the game's level design is made up of non-modular tiles which stack on top of one another, it takes away from the game's overall level of polish. Some levels do sport modular tiles, like ground tiles; however, others such as dungeons simply don't and are mostly made up of spammed tile placement.- Enemies are mostly re-used and lack diversity."

For a platform game, I appreciate the effort but its clear the developer wanted to create a frustrating experience that makes you have to retry the same level over and over again.  Many times you cant even see that moving to the next screen or jumping down leads to your imminent death.  The ""predictable"" boss mechanics also change if you get too close, and often times they will alter what should normally happen just to kill you and make you start over.  Oh, and conveyer belts.

The graphics are nice, the levels are well designed, it feels like a retro game, all should be great! The problem is the controls, they ruined any enjoyment I got from the game at first. The maps require preciscion platforming a lot of the time, problem is jumping is extremely floaty and movement is stiff. There also seems to be an input lag, I'm using a wired Xbox 360 controller which works fine on every other game, especially on jumping. The bosses are lazy, the first three are the same boss with a different color pallet and play mostly the same but with a small twist, the fourth boss was more uniquely designed but is still just a big bird, last boss is another big bird but is the most creative and fun to fight of all. To see the true ending of the game you have to collect all of the coins which is where I'm at right now, some of them are easy to find others are not which I have no problem with. My issue here is with the map, you select a level and play it but if you run out of lives you have to return to the map and reselect a map. This can be annoying if you're stuck with having one life due to a level you're struggling with, especially when hunting for coins where you may be dying more. Lastly the hit boxes are just odd, yours is bigger than your character and you can take damage by landing on the edge, I mean top of the head but near the edge of it, of some enemies heads. Overall  it's a good game ruined by bad controls along with lazy boss design and a few bad design choices. 5/10 It's too bad there's no neutral option.EDIT: As I continue to play this game I found two bugs that keep popping up that are worth mentioning. First of all when you gather 100 coins you gain a spare item, it's hard to explain but basically you see the icon of the item in the bottom right of the screen and when you press Y (on a controller) you use the item, if it's a power up you gain that powerup, but the problem is it works when it wants to. So many times I'd lose my powerup and try to use my spare only for it to disappear from the bottom right of my screen and me not gain the effect of the item. Next up is conveyer belts, if you happen to run into one while sprinting sometimes you use the belt as normal, other times you just move forward at walking speed, unable to turn around, across them then if you try to jump you just give a normal jump forward.EDIT: There is one more issue I forgot to bring up, the springs. They are attrocious, the hitboxes are dead center on the spring and only a couple of pixels, which makes then a pain to use, these should be made larger in a future update, otherwise it's hard to judge exactly where I am about to be launched into the air which just makes it easy to misjudge a jump from one spring to the next, which happens many times in this game, unless you somehow have a perfect landing technique."

If anything, this game resembles Superfrog - a billion levels with very little to set them apart from each other, and every single one is filled to the brim with secrets of varying usefulness and satisfaction upon collection. The way the stages are mostly built from a sprinkle of narrow little platforms also spells Superfrog, or a lackluster Mario hack rather than the real deal.The features thatdomake me think of Mario, such as hitting blocks repeatedly for multiple coins, seem to have been borrowed without much thought. It's questionable whether these blocks were all that fun to begin with, but certainly no new ground is broken by placing them willy-nilly in empty corridors, especially in a game where separate 10-coin pickups exist.Aside from being a mess of tiny blocks, the level design is repetitive with a noticeable lack of interesting enemy placement and unique stage features. Low-ceiling instakill pits abound. Enemies, on the other hand, usually present no challenge due to the player character's super overpowered projectile attacks that bounce everywhere and kill most baddies before they've properly entered the screen. The projectiles are lost upon death and require multiple pickups to regain, though, contributing to a shifty game balance.The basic movement mechanics are solid enough, so if you really like bouncing around and finding a coin stash from every block of land big enough for one in an environment where nothing leaves a lasting impression, you will probably love this game. If you've actually played the nonspecific platforming greats this game tries to emulate, I'll be surprised if 8BitBoy leaves you satisfied. Unless, of course, the untouchable classicyouwere thinking of is Superfrog."

,Not Recommended,296910,25506311,"Posted: 14 September, 2016",all,Station Earth,"This is one of those platforming games that aim to be retro and challenging which it accomplishes in a sense, but in a rather bland sense.For some reason the world has been overrun by a reign of birds and your goal I assume is to take it back. Although the world offers a good number of scenery, the same can't be said for the enemies. As the previous sentence states, the enemies only consist of birds. They fire projectiles in which you're supposed to dodge (for obvious reasons) but that's about it. There's no different sprites, just chirpy chirps, even the bosses are birds. Your projectile is also flawed beyond belief. When you obtain your projectile, you can finally give those feathered ♥♥♥♥faces a taste of their own medicine, but there's one trade-off. If you've already watched the video above, you can clearly see that the projectile fires at a slight upwards slant. Um... why? Why does the projectile fire slightly upwards? I don't see a reason for this and in the obscure Nintendo game ""Milon's Secret Castle"", proves ineffective and ultimately causes even more frustration when playing.Game controls are a bit slippery and jumping can be unpredictable at times, jumping on an enemy can send you flying or in other cases bouncing off as if you hit a speed bump. Best thing that can be described is that this game is more hard to play than anything. The game does require you to have some form of precision platforming skills but aside from that the levels are more trial than error if anything. There are many blocks that crumble when you land on them causing you to slightly bounce thus sending you into the pit of the unknown. There are no indications that they are fragile hence ""trial and error"".The secrets like the game states is plentiful, but you have so little time to find them that there just isn't anything there to motivate you to do so. I have found some if not most of the secrets by surprise and it's really is nothing special, just a few extra coins or a weapon upgrade but other than that it's nothing. The description says it begs exploring, but you'll be begging for the time to explore it.All this being said though, the game is I guess worth the price even at original. It is about 10 hours at least worth of gameplay if you play it like normal and even more if you try finding all those secrets. When you buy it on sale on the other hand, it's well under a dollar and if you're into platformers than by all means grab it."

Left right arrows to move, up arrow to jump, space to shoot, hold space to run. You can change the keys if you like, and it has gamepad support (which I do not have). The game itself is very reminicent of the old school games back in the 80's, which is what the purpose of the game is from my understanding. It achieves this goal very well. Appearance, sounds, etc brings me back to that era of gameplay. With that said, if you are born in the late 90s, you may not fully appreciate this game for what it is. But for someone like me, a child of the 80's, this is incredible. I highly recommend this game!"

,Recommended,296910,25597780,"Posted: 19 September, 2016",all,AV Archivist,"It's not a Mario clone... It's what the developer says: an homage to retro platformers. Tight controls, creative level design, and a nice level of challenge. It took me a little while to really get into it and a lot my early frustrations were a simple matter of needing to ""get gud"" but this title ultimately stands out to me as a success.My only criticisms of the game are the lack of achievements/trading cards and the Casual/Retro difficulties. Imo, the only difficulty should be Retro, wherein it saves when you find the secret hidden coins. When playing Retro you can tell the game was designed such that it's meant to be played that way, and the difficulty of certain parts is tuned such that it expects you to have either just saved or that you're just about to save. Conversely, on Casual, where you save at the start of every level, the difficulty sometimes seems lopsided and sporadic.If you buy this game I strongly encourage playing on Retro and taking the time to explore and find the secret coins, which you need in order to see the real ending anyways."

,Not Recommended,296910,26043239,"Posted: 14 October, 2016",all,left OvR pudinS,"Honestly, I want to finish this game, and I probably will. But the 8 to 12 hours of gameplay might be more because the physics are awful. I am already more than halfway through in what is currently a 2 hour playthrough. The hit boxes seem to either be pixel perfect or a square around the player, but it switches randomly and usually not in your favor. You slide on surfaces that you shouldn't slide on, making more of your movements overcorrections than actual movements. I have died so many frustrating times simply because the physics do not match the surfaces I am running on.The graphics are cool and the asthetic are super retro and definitely fit the genre. I love that about this game. But honestly, this is more of a rage platformer than a game like Mario, simply because you do not die of your own misaction most of the time. Usually it is from sliding off something you shouldn't be able to slide off of, or because the collision detection changes randomly and decides that a bird can clip through a wall and shoot you, yet the first pixel they collide with you is an instant death without any powerups.Which brings me another point. Powerups should be more plentiful because they are lost so easily and often. Sure, this may add challenge and difficulty to some who are looking for it. But when you die mostly cheap deaths and you lose your power ups so easily, there should be more scattered in the map.Finally, this game encourages exploration. That is great. The problem is that many areas have spiky or open floors, so you die a lot trying to figure out whether something is hidden down below or not because the game is not consistent with ""death areas"". A few of them are marked with skull signs to say ""Hey, you will die if you fall here"". But most are not, and again, many deaths will come from the fact that you cannot tell which is which.Because of these factors, I will finish the game, but I am not looking to try to find all the secrets or anything like that. It is too frustrating and unforgiving to truly encourage exploration like it wants. Not all is bad about the game. Unfortunately, what is bad is more central to the game itself, and thus strips the shine away from some of the other elements. As much as I love these kinds of games and have forever, I would not recommend this game unless the physics get a reworking."

Overall, worth the money.Update: After having played with an xbox controller, I've found the game quite a bit more fun than before. Some of the tighter jumps can lead to combos and there is quite a bit of technical jumping. The secrets are fun to find also. On the whole, this game definitely does some things well the material it's an homage to did. This is a good brain relaxer, for sure."

,Not Recommended,296910,29796707,Posted: 8 February,all,Sharks++,"8BitBoy? More like 16BitBoy. This game has too much bit depth to be 8 bit game, but pedantics aside......this game gave me cancer. 16BitBoy is a uninspired, saccharine clone of Mario with none of the visual charm or addictive gameplay but 500% more blandness. The levels are repetitive. Grassy area. Dungeon. Grassy area. Dungeon. Grassy area (with water this time!). Dungeon. Ad nauseum.  The enemies are also uninspired. Want to kill the whole cast of Angry Birds? Here's your chance! Hope you enjoy jumping on avian heads for hours on end.The navigational mechanics could also use some work. Whenever the player character is in contact with solid ground they slide around like a greased sea cucumber on a slip'n'slide. Combine oil spill physics with pinpoint platforming and you're looking at purchasing multiple sets of new monitors in the future (and perhaps several anger management sessions with the local therapist).Just a peeve of mine, but one small thing I hate about this game is smarmy puke you're forced to play as for the duration of the game. I am not comfortable with him winking at me and giving the thumbs up at the end of each level. Makes me want to knock the grin off the stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥ each time he does it....TLDR: This game is like a clone of Mario, if said clone had a lobotomy and was 300% less likeable than Waluigi.2/10 Would not recommend this game."

There is simply one reason why I'm leaving a negative review; the game would be perfectly done except for one thing: the threshold between ""challenging"" and ""frustrating"".In few words (and IMHO) a good game ceases to be challenging when it becomes repetitive; it's ok to die several times and having to get back and repeat the stage from some checkpoint, but this game has no such thing and the lives count is useless; wheather you die with 10 or 1 life left, you have to get back and start from the same (save) point, which is exclusively at the beginning of every stage. Games like this are made to accumulate a dozen hours of gameplay in expense of the fun. I've played 2-hours worth of gameplay titles who gave me so much enjoyment and satisfaction thus had no need to be any longer to beat.My advice: add some more freaking save points middle stage for once, and then make the player start from the beginning of the stage once there are no lives left."

I unintentionally had to play through twice because of deleting my progress which was a bummer, but I enjoyed the game enough to push through to the finish. Yes it can be repetitive and unforgiving at times, I died over and over and would get frustrated, but it was rewarding to finally beat level after level. I will eventually play again without using the warp paths because in a way I feel like its cheating. If this game looks like something you might be interested in, get it on sale like I did.
