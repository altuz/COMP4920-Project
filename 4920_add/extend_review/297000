I'll let everyone make their own assumptions after this short review without pointing fingers to who does what (hint/hint).I instantly got interested in this version hoping that somewhat refreshed visuals might make an old gem look more visually polished. I was wrong. The difference is almost unnoticable and due to the downside of having only Restoration of Erathia instead of full package of 2 expansions with additional castle, items and limitless map generator, this purchase is not worth even 1/3rd of the price of full game on good old games site -http://www.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_editionwhich costs twice less by default.DO not buy Steam version. Save Your money and conscience, get GOG version. A few pixels more, no achievements, but whole package.As this is only 3rd of the full game which has nothing new in that third, it cannot have score of more than just a 3rd of a game.3/10"

The graphics look like they were only scaled up and smoothed out. Meaning parts look blurry, lacking in detail, and horrible black borders around characters.2. The colours seem to have been oversaturated in the process, making your eyes tired and sting when looking at the screen.3. The animation is painful to watch. Agreed, the original animation was not beautiful or smooth, but I expected that the movements might have been smoothed out - Instead they are choppier and clumsier than ever.4. There is no random map feature... which is what made the original game playable for 16 years.5. E...ver...y...thing... Is... So. Slow. I play Dragon Age 3 on the highest graphic settings without any issues, but this HOMM3 HD remake lags as if I was playing online with a 64kbps connection.6. Features missing, like for example hotkeys. I´ve always played this game using hotkeys, but now they can´t be used.7. Online multiplayer doesn´t work. The multiplayer functionality is one of the main reasons I bought the game, as it is cumbersome to try and set up the kind of networks that the original one needs to work, but now it feels like I wasted 15 euros on this game.TL;DRAs I loved the original game to bits I obviously had very high hopes for this remake, and I am sad to say that this version does not live up to the original and is not worth the 15 euros it costs. My recommendation is to seek out the original game and play that instead."

Here's the Pros and Cons of this ""new and improved version of Heroes III""Pros:- ""HD""- It's Heroes IIIWell that was easy.Cons:- ""HD"" only improves pixel quality, with no improvements to compatibility to its framerates it may look ""nice"" at a standstill but who cares about motionless, sub-par ""HD""- No Random Map Generator that Heroes III Complete has.- No Conflux Race that Heroes III Complete has.- More expensive than Heroes III Complete, and it doesn't even have Random Map Generator nor Conflux Race among Other things. (The 2 expansions)- Buggier. Who the hell remakes a game only to make it buggier? Seriously. WTF.- Crashes more often. Same as above.- No Random Map Generator. That's a big deal you know. Those who havn't had it just don't know how much they're missing.Ultimately, would I play Heroes of Might & Magic III - HD Edition? Nope. Waste of Money. Heroes of Might & Magic III Complete is 9/10 times better. I at least hoped they would have made the HD versions online playability better but.... Thanks Ubisoft, I don't know what I was expecting. Obviously something better than this piece of crap.Let me say this again. Ubisoft is charging you MORE for this ""HD"" version that is missing not one, but TWO expansions. It is BUGGIER, crashes MORE frequently, and again, they had the GALL to charge  more for it. I've been disapointed before; but, this takes the cake."

Essentially, Ubisoft couldn't get the source code for the expansion packs (disappointing) and declared that programming them again from scratch would be too much effort (understandable).The dealbreaker for me is that the complete edition with all expansions is available very cheaply on Good Old Games - there's no reason to buy this when the old version is cheaper and gives you more content.For what it's worth, the ""HD"" update is exactly what it says on the tin but it's not what you're hoping for. Pretty much all the sprites used to create the game were re-traced and more detail was added. I respect the work that must have taken, but at the end of the day it still looks like the game from the nineties that it is. You wanted the gameplay - the exact graphics are more-or-less irrelevant to me."
,Not Recommended,297000,15719074,"Posted: 6 May, 2015",all,Cablenexus,"I am old. My first PC game purchase ever was Heroes of Might and Magic III. A Windows 95 CD-Rom with an instruction book on real paper and my PC was not even met the requirements. It was an amazing experience. Little figures on a map searching for treasures and fighting monsters was something I only knew from table top games and now happened live on my 14"" CRT screen.A whole world opened for me and since then I was really addicted to the Fantasy Turn Based Strategy genre.Later played the Warlords series, the Age of Wonders series and the Disciples series.Almost 20 years later I still have Homm3 installed on my PC and now and then I even met people with the same experience from this game and we play hotseat together a whole night.I still own the original homm3 box, the Shadows of Magic boxed edition, the Collector's edition and the GOG version and when I don't have one available when I'm somewhere else I pirate it for a moment. I guess that's legal because I own the game in four different versions.All this years so many progress is made by the real fans of this series to make the 20 year old title even better. We have VCMI, HD mod, Hota and so much user created content now that it is almost impossible to make a new edtion better then what is available fromt the community.Maybe the biggest reason for me to play this game all this years without getting bored is that every map I play is different and unpredictable. This is because a generator creating a different map every play. IMO a must for every strategy/RPG/Adventure game on the market. I do not like scripted games, predictable games or story campaigns so much because after playing it one time I lost my interest to play the same map again. Also it keeps multiplayer fair because this way the map cannot be learned by players so nobody have advantage of knowing a map better then you.Now imagine the best book you ever read and imagine a cheap B movie producer turns your book into a bad movie. That is exactly what happened with this version of Homm3 for me. The menu's of the game did not have any overhaul and are not fit in my laptop screen resolution anymore while the original 20 year old game does. For every click I make in the menu I have to wait at least two seconds while in the original game I misclick because the interface is so fast.I don't see any progress in interface or menu artwork and it's so much slower then the original. I don't understand this.All content after the original game came out like the expansions, the user created content, the new factions, the thousands of maps/campaigns and even the RMG (random map generator) is not there. It's just the base game and even the base game on GOG have more content because it's at least updated with bugfixes afterwards.The unique selling point from Dotemu is the graphics overhaul and Í have to admit that it is very nice to see that someone spend so many hours creating better looking monsters and heroes for my favorite game of all time.The units are cleaner and less pixelated on higher resolutions now and that is not bad. But they do not try something original or different so it's not amazing or surprisingly good. Just ok. In the town screens and on the map I cannot see any difference with the original and because every click is so much slower then the original game for me it's not worth the graphic overhaul.I bought the game just to support the graphic artist and to have a voice on Steam to write my review.I don't like the remake of my favorite game is not the perfect remake I can imagine. A remake IMO can never be a downgrade of the original. If you don't have original code from expansions you have to wait more time to release while hiring people from the community to make the perfect game or just don't touch it.It looks like a quick project to make cashflow for the company instead of a soul project led by people dedicated to the Homm series. That's something bad."

But as of NOW, and for THIS edition of the game..Conflux, powerful combo artifacts, new map locations, and the random map generator will be missed, but the prospect of a smooth(?) multiplayer environment, where you won't have to experience ""can't connect, timed out"" to a computer 5 metres away meaning you don't spend 30 minutes just trying to get everyone into the lobby and God forbid anyone disconnects during the 4 hour session... Worth. Or so I thought....We're missing LAN - the only reason I (and probably you too, if you ever buy this) got this edition is because windows no longer supports IPX and all the problems that came with trying to start a session on TCP/IP. But no UDP? Not a gameplay issue and we are expected to play via steam, but still..Also, multiplayer got a new problem. There is this previously unheard of 5~10 sec 'loading' period at the end of EVERY HUMAN PLAYER'S TURN, where all animations freeze and you can't do anything, kinda like the little unskippable tune you had to hear at the beginning of every turn during hot seat, just more insane with no workarounds (and that tune served a purpose, like kicking your friend out of the room before he spied on you - this doesn't) - I have no idea what the game is doing while it throws me an hourglass but it wasn't and shouldn't be there. Most of us do indeed alt+tab during opponent's turns, but early game this practically doubles turn cycles.Please tell me they're patching the hourglass thing.

I can run Rome 2 total war a lot better than this game it seems.Unskippable Ubisoft logo at the intro, like they are proud of it somehow, though that can be modified out of the game by changing the files in the game folder.The music, instead of continuing where it left off like in the original, restarts now everytime the music changes. Walking in a grass field, cue the beginning of the grass theme, go to a city, cue the beginning of the appropriate city music. Needless to say it gets very very annoying to hear the same part of the same song every few minutes. Always the beginning of the song, always. You never spend that much time looking at your city, or walking your hero, so you never really hear the whole song, only the beginning. I get the idea that listening to a song from the middle can be a bad idea, but when the music is constantly changing, the old style fade in and fade out, and starting where you left off just worked so much better and just felt so much more right.Pressing space to visit the location you are standing on got dropped out as well. If you take a wrong portal, you are forced to spend movement going out of the portal and back in. Same if you happen to end your turn and the week on a mill. No idea why they thought that was an ability that had to be removed.I have heard rumors that cheats work in multiplayer, I haven't checked it myself, had trouble playing online. It's not working as well as I hoped.The achievements are, to put it lightly, uninspired. There are no fun achievements to chase, as in Crusader Kings II or Europa Universalis. They are all like this: Beat this campaign, beat that campaign, beat this campaign. That's not really fun chasing those achievements, the campaigns may be fun to play, but the achievements are not even flavoring, they are just there so they could put ''Achievements'' in the description.  Was it absolutely impossible to have a achievement like ''Have every type of dragon in your army'' or ''Win a battle with only seven dwarfs''? Yes. Yes it was. That would have meant that they would actually had to put some work into the game.There... that's what's wrong with the base game. I know they didn't include the expansions, so i'm not complaining about that, since that was never advertised.In summary: It's lazy, it's buggy, it's bad. Ubisoft should just start working on games for tabloids and phones, because that is clearly what they want."

I grew up with it as a child, and I distinctly remember playing both heroes of m&m and heroes chronicles which I got when I was 4.When I saw this in steam, my heart leapt with joy! Not only could I relive some joyful childhood memories, but others could as well. This product didn't cut it.Its not so much the random map generator. If this game was finished and you were really that concerned about this aspect, you could have hit upgog.comfor the full complete non hd version. That version still has a working map generator, and you could generate your maps, save them, and transfer them over to this game.You COULD possibly do this IF this game was FINISHED. Its not.Its missing both its add ons, which is a real dissapointment for me. It makes it so much less enjoyable; less enchanting than its original predecesor. It also makes it impossible to use the map generator or any maps you may have made as a kid using your original game copy (I have a original game of Heroes 3 on cd, and none of the maps I generate or make on that game copy work with this).While this game is hd, its not heroes 3.I recomend the following replacements:Heroes 3 complete edition: Located atgog.com. Just make an account and follow the steps, its not that hard. Comes with all add ons and random map gen.Also for the heck of it, Heroes Chronicles: mini game series based around heroes 3 which in my opinion gave a much more in dept storyline for people not invested in the history of heroes of might and magic to follow. Meaning, it starts you off with a charecter (Tarnum?), and you get to see his life play out from the beginning. Also located atgog.com. Only catch is that you may have to buy all of the games to get the full experience of Heroes 3 (landscape and castle/creature wise) and I dont currently know how much it costs.Sad that I have to give this a thumbs down but... well I cry because I care."

So I will probably go back to the HoMM3C version with HD mod when not attempting to play multiplayer.I really want to give this a positive review, and will do so if they manage to fix the issues that plague multiplayer and user-interface.The ball is in your court development team!"

I find it extremely hard that a team of lawyers, the size and quality that unisoft has, would have let the purchase go down without getting the source code for the DLCs along with the base game, pinned onto the fact that it obviously exists somewhere if somebody is still selling full copys of the game.Tl;dr Its not even worth the nostalgia."

,Not Recommended,297000,14303381,"Posted: 2 February, 2015",all,CherokeeStarfish,"It breaks my heart to give this game a negative rating, but Ubisoft has made another crap decision with the Heroes franchise.HOMM5 gave me some hope after 3DO and New World Computing tanked; the art style recalled the lightheartedness of Heroes 2, the town screens were gorgeous, and it seemed like they put a lot of thought and effort into building a new world for the franchise. Now, I'm starting to think it's actually because they have no respect for the old one.I grew up with HOMM 1 - 3; my parents still spend hours and hours every week enjoying the GOG version of Heroes 3, which includes the Armageddon's Blade and Shadow of Death expansions. As excited as I was for this re-release, after having actually taken it out for a test drive, I have to recommend the GOG version over this mess by quite a wide margin.Firstly, it's just the original game, with no expansions. That makes the current price tag a bit steep, considering what you get with the GOG package (which is also DRM-free and doesn't require a client to play). Secondly, every supposed ""improvement"" they've made comes at the cost of an established feature: Pressing the space bar no longer allows you to revisit locations atop which your selected hero is currently standing, for instance, and lots of other hotkey shortcuts are absent, as well. Gameplay is often jerky or strangely slow despite the high requirements for such an old game. Some in-game art has been poorly remastered and looks stark and out of place against unaltered backgrounds, creating an overal effect like someone lazily went through and applied Photoshop filters to existing elements. The multiplayer barely works, and then not very well. Perhaps most telling is the absence of the trademark random map generator, which was a highlight of the franchise and one of the things that continues to make HOMM3 playable decades later.I really played this re-release up to my family and friends, all of whom are fans of the series, but now I'm wishing I had my preorder money back. I feel like the game is not at all as advertised, much in the same way that Ubisoft failed to tell anyone that their proprietary U-play client was required to play Might & Magic X.Painful though it may be, file this ""HD remake"" in the garbage along with Heroes 6."

I mean, who wouldnt? Adventurous graphics, the amazing music composition is still better than most games I've ever played, it just gives the game more depth, it gives every scene - terrain, base and combat their own distinct feel to it. The GUI is very well made, especially compared to other games from its time period.But this HD edition just comes a bit short in my opinion, without the expansions this game just feels incomplete, the only reason I bought it is because it was on sale and I havent played all the way through the original campaign and I thought it could be fun to experience it in HD. And hopefully (call me naive) if enough people buy the game, they will finish what they started. Even though I wouldnt count on it, after all, it is Ubisoft that now owns this franchise, sadly.I see a lot of people complaining about no random map generator, the first thing that annyoed me was the simpler things like if you upgrade a dwelling in your base, you cant buy the non-upgraded creature from said dwelling anymore. This is because this was a feature first implemented in one of the the expansions. Not to mention that Conflux base is missing, and every custom game map from the expansions, which, I guess only makes the fact that no random map generator is present even more frustrating for people.In conclusion: Pick it up on sale if you want it, it's not worth the full pricetag.

I'm saying about 50% because if you play all the campaigns and every campaign is approximately 3 maps, you have 18 maps, with the expansions theres another 13 campaigns for 39 maps and you even get an extra town, see why its 50%? Heck, it's even more, I'm just being generous. On top of that for single scenario allows random generated maps, which make multiplyaer fun. Without random generated single scenarios multiplayer because different because you have to choose a premade map, that one of your friends know like the back of their hand and it creates unfair advantage.Now, for what the HD edition does offer some screen size changes and whether or not you want it on fullscreen or not, but the hd mod covers that, the only good thing is everything technically being stretched which makes the game more comfortable. I guess this does support tablet play which is nice on the go, I would play this on a tablet, but even then the expansions could have been released because its just more space at that point. Space on a tablet isnt an issue considering modern storage devices. The sprites are new and fresh in order to preserve the appeal to the game which is fine, its not amazing because the animations arent more fluid but I am impressed in how they buffered things without making them look like a different game.

,Not Recommended,297000,14288240,"Posted: 1 February, 2015",all,Blitz4,"This game is tough to review. It's an upgraded version of the original, which released back in 1999. I don't care to, and have never played H3 multiplayer, keep that in mind. I have never played the original vanilla game, instead I used a mod to make the game playable on modern computers, I'll get to that in a moment.The biggest pros are the new HD graphics, standard support for 1080p, and more than 64k colors.The biggest cons for the new HD version is that you could install a mod for the original game called 'HoMM3 HD' (https://sites.google.com/site/heroes3hd/) which supported larger resolutions than the standard 800x600, 32-bit colors, and it added A LOT to the game, A LOT! You can imagine a mod being worked on for at least 5 years, has some great features. After you use the mod, it's hard to go back to the vanilla game and all of the mouse clicking involved with it.I'm not here to say this HD version sucks, it's a classic game. You can play random maps by loading pre-built RoE random maps generated with the original game (or downloaded online). There's a tablet version, but you could already play the original game on a tablet before.To me the only thing this game adds to the old game is updated graphics, and for me that's not that big of a deal, I would rather have the features from the HD mod instead of the graphics, so I'll stick to the old game until there's a mod for H3 HD.I'm also hating that I'm reviewing a game called ""Heroes of Might & Magic 3 HD"", but it should be called ""Heroes of Might & Magic 3 - Restoration of Erathia HD"" --- there's a big difference and I'm still sore about it.(2017-07-20):It's come to my attention the reason Ubi decided not include the expansions of the game because the were unable to acquire the original source code (source). I linked to thearchive.orgversion so ubi can't change anything like they already have. You'll notice currently the image in the Steam store says 'The Restoration of Erathia' underneath HD Edition. This was NOT the case when I originally purchased the game:proofUbi had this image, which includes the RoE tagline at the bottom, back in 2014 before the game was released on Steam, but decided to omit that and made no mention that it didn't include the expansions, nor did they provide a link to their page on their website that said it didn't include it. I'm not sure if they even had this game on their own store back in 2015 (it's not there as of today). I believe that I should be allowed to receive a full refund for purchasing a game that isn't as advertised. Yes, I am still sore about it.BTW, the 'HoMM3 HD' that I posted above will not work with this game. Take a look at what that mod does for the UI:hereAlso, sales figures and average playtime stats are in:https://steamspy.com/app/297000"

More detailed hero portraits are nice, sure, but why are the town portraits more blurry than ever? Some UI updates? Nice, but it doesn't look good outside on the adveture map. The bold font choice for messages like the ones on the start of the scenarios is a bit hard to read as well.Entering the towns, they do look good, though. The sharper edges really come to their rights there. For creatures, the updates are very hit and miss: Pikemen, griffons and orcs come to mind as pretty bad updates. Goblins, ogres and black dragons look pretty amazing.In combat, the movement shadow comes with a grid you can't turn off, which I personally find offputting. Some animations seem more clunky and chopped up than before.All in all, not really worth the extra money, although it is really, really nice to play without that awful Conflux again.

Unfortunatly the game does not run any better than the old version on newer machines, the game would often freeze for a split second when doing tasks with your hero like digging for the grail. Also since I have two monitors, the game would frequently bug out when scrolling towards my 2nd monitor, even when playing in fullscreen mode.Another big letdown was the fact that the HD Edition DID NOT include the 2 expansion packs The Shadow of Death and Armageddon's Blade, meaning you are losing out on a lot of already released content.

Two good examples are that black dragons are no longer immune to magic, and dwarves are no longer magic resistant. Also, some of the old maps are missing. On the up side they did add some new maps. To me, a HoMM fan from the release of HoMM 1, this modified version feels dumbed down and less challenging. Battles will usually be determined by who has the most and the highest level monsters, and not who is best able to leverage their creature's assets better against their opponant's creature's weaknesses. That's because the advantages and disadvantage have all been nurfed to the point where there really isn't much difference between two differerent creatures of the same level.I wondered if perhaps my perceptions were just a matter of memory being distorted by the mists of time so I go out my old CD's and started up DOSBox and there it was, just as I remembered. BIG difference! Checkers vs. Chess. I thought that I might be able to soften the disapointment by copying over some of the maps which were left out,but instead i was in for another disappointment. The original files and all those user created maps from 1999 are incompatable with this version.All that said, I hesitatate to give it a thumbs down. For those who never knew the 1999 New World Computing version, this could be a fun, light strategy and tactics game minus all the minutia and micro-management of epic strategy games of the Europa Universalis genre. It weighs in lighter than  the Total War series too. If you want some strategy but its been a long, demanding day at work or school and your brain just wants to take it easy for the evening, this might be just the perfect thing.NOTESince writing this review it has been brought to my attention by Steam user potmdehex that a mod has been released which will convert the old map format to the new format. This adds quite a bit more value to the game considering how many excellent user made maps are still floating around on the Internet, not to mention the fact that it makes the original official game map available again. Information regarding this mod can be found right here on Steam at the HD Edition forum at address:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198001014053/recommended/297000?tscn=1463098014Again, many thanks to potmdehex for this welcome information (even if his name is a little <adgitive of your choice, either positive or negative>.

I mean it is cool that you updated graphics and multiplayer functionality but the problem is overall gameplay features. For example game is blocked during a sound effect. These tiny things definitely affect the gameplay and can be annoying in the long term. There is a fanmade HD mod that I've been playing for years and it fixes overall UX and gameplay screen is actually widened with more resolution instead of stretching. I expected such an improvement from this HD Edition. It's really strange that Russians were somehow able to greatly improve a closed source game by modding better than a company that has the source codes and resources to do so.

,Recommended,297000,25265710,"Posted: 31 August, 2016",all,Nuuskiss,"Rated this up but simultaneously giving my contribution for criticism, which is certainly justifiable.Heroes III is generally known as the most successful title of the series and might be the best turn-based strategy title as well. And why it shouldn't be - everything works like clockworks from rpg -elements to the unit balances. Among campaing there is a couple dozens mini scenarios which can be played with either AI or another player.For those few who are completly new with Heroes of Might and Magic here is some summary about the formula of the series. You start on some random map with a hero and a castle of your chosen faction. With your hero you go adventuring into world which is filled with artifacts, treasure and resources with which you are able to build structures and hire new units from your castle to fight creatures lurking on the map or another competing factions. Your hero also gathers experience with various ways to upgrade his/her skills and attributes going from being a novice to ultimate master of Might and/or Magic. The scenarios are usually won by defeating other factions, some boss hero or gathering x amount of resources.All these core elements are flawless in Heroes 3 and this HD version that also gives a slight graphical face lift for it. Excluding a couple very random bugs - everything works without problems on my Windows 10.However after all this years we could wait some wrapping up of this remastered title, but this is the where it let's people down. It doesn't include expansions The Shadow of Death or Armageddon's Blade which multiplied gameplay time, indroduced new units among brand new elemental-based faction 'Conflux' which is favorated by many players.I myself could actually turn a blind eye for this neglect but I understand that when there is a steak available the minced meat is going to be hard to swallow. Heroes 3 is available in other cloud stores in a version where expansions are included. They don't have HD on them but I surely would spend my dollar into some significant features instead of graphical details which I usually forget while playing this classic.In conclusion Heroes 3 HD is solid, mighty and magical turn-based strategy experience and could be recommented even in its normal price if it wouldn't enjoy reputation of missed opportunity. Definitely worth it with a minor price tag though. If Heroes 3 HD should (I've odd feeling it will) have expansions included in the future I hope that for the sake of fairness they could be purchased as free dlc."

I don't even care about the whole ""Remade in HD"" fuss, I just love it that I get to play this masterpiece via Steam now, it's just convenient.What's fun about the game is that even if it is so simple in terms of gameplay and strategies in comparison to many other strategy games, as it's still very versatile when it comes to different towns, heroes, units and so forth.So basically you start with a town. There's plenty to choose from and each has their strengths. The towns are upgradeable and the buildings you buy or upgrade then will either give strenghths, bonuses or enable you to recuit certain types of military units, which your heroes can then take under their control as they start to explore the campaign map for resources, treasures, other towns or enemies to conquer and defeat, as well as other odds and ends. each player also gets a starting hero and can recuit more from their towns. Heroes all have specialities and gain experience via battles. When leveling up, they can choose a new skill to learn or upgrade an existing one. Skills llow you to cast spells on your enemies or support your own army, give your units damage or defence boosts, allow you to travel and see further, or even allow them to make neutral armies join you; or raise the dead to fight in your undead armies after bloody battles!The units in the game are also very diverse. Some are like tanks, some fly, some do ranged attacks, some can support other units and some weaken stats of enemies, some heal after attacking, some are immune to all magic, whether it was to make them stronger or weaker.The battles are fought on a grid and are also turn based, often with obstacles on them. There are different strategies when it comes to battles but the most common one is to send your melee units forth and keep your ranged lads in the backline. Some units may even fly, which is convenient to eliminate enemy ranged units  as they can fly over obstacles and melee enemies.Well; I relly don't know what other to say about this game so I will conclude;In a nutshell; it's like a good RPG with the exception that also strategy; you control multiple characters, who then control armies.

I do recommend Homm3 in general. However, This version IS to be recommended to people that's never been playing Homm3 before, as it offers a smooth experience with multiplayer (a broader community as Gameranger is hosting different versions of the game which may or may NOT be compatible with the one you have) and it, obviously, got some nice edges to it. If you loved the older graphics, it's still available with the push of a button.This ""review"" will mention some features which is ""hidden"", both positive and negative.-This version offers a stable type of multiplayer solution imbedded in the game. When you enter the lobby, the game will prompt you to open 3 specific ports. This isn't necessarily required, as i've personally played several games via the games own MP function with friends which hasn't touched the ports/their router.-This version is actually having a very stable MP solution, and we've never experienced any DROPS in connection from any party while playing (3 people on different locations with solid Nordic internet provider)-The graphic is actually showing more than ""just boosted sprites"" when you look at certain features such as faces on heroes and creatures. Half of them look ♥♥♥♥ing insane due to insane-staring-eyes, but sharper edges makes things look pleasant.-The map editor in this is poor, more so for the lack of the well-loved obstacle brush which is available in the ""complete"" version which includes the expansions. I was told by a kind and well-informed gentleman in the community forum here on steam that the complete version map-editor actually is compatible with this product here on steam IF you during map editing in the other version ENABLE restoration of erathia as compatible - the map editor itself should help you out with verifying that in it's embedded tools.-The map editor IS functioning if you still want to create some more intense, smaller maps, however, which is a pleasant surprise to me-Streaming the game works great, and it's nothing to it. Very easy and smooth. Also a recommendation to stream for your friends while you play to allow for more fun during the turns.Again - i can't recommend someone pay 15 bucks for this game if you somehow already have a functioning version of it available, and if you're a veteran and tired of the vanilla. BUT i can recommend it for reasons presented above.On a sidenote: I suspect that we might actually see the other expansions delievered to us in a future, for free or for a few dollaz, from Ubisoft.  The lost sourcecode is probably not even true.Second sidenote: I own 3 different setups of the game, and i've lost countless others. My gametime must be 2000+"

That is a real shame, but there are still easily 80+ hours gameplay to be had just from the original RoE campaigns and included scenario maps. Still highly recommended!"

I expected there to be as much content as there was in the original, I mean, why wouldn't there be. Why would you buy a game with less content for more money. I would've been happy with a revamped complete edition:- There are no expansions in it, and most likely there never will be. This means, NO MAP EDITOR, which is the only thing I personally play. No new content, and infact, THERE IS MUCH LESS CONTENT. The original version is MUCH MUCH better.- The original version works great, even on windows 8.1, and you can download a free HD mod for it. Original version is MUCH better.- Issues with multiplayer, lots of reported bugs in MP and singleplayer. You can simply use a virtual LAN service and you can play MP even with really slow connections and old PC's. Original version is A LOT BETTER.- The original game, with ALL content, costs far less than a game with MUCH LESS CONTENT. The original game is much much better.- None of the problems with the original game, though none game breaking, have been improved upon. It's been 15 years, several mods have been made to take inspiration from. But nothing has been done to make this worthwhile. This game is worth less than a modder could have done for free.I think this pretty much sums it up. I don't know why anyone would make this type of a revamp. In 15 years one could presume there would be a lot of improvements. DO NOT BUY THIS, EVEN IF YOU REALLY FEEL LIKE GETTING IT. JUST GET THE ORIGINAL ONE AND RESIST THAT URGE TO GIVE IT A CHANCE."

Ubisoft claims that when they went through New World Computings files they could not find the source codes for those. Simple. This is the first strategy game I have played ever in my life and for a game that was made near two decades ago it still beats most of the strategy games of today. HD resolution looks pretty legitimate, they did the best they could, as it seems.Pros:+Pretty good faction/creature design. Infact that this game paved the wave for most of the epic/fantasy games of the future both lore and visual-wise.+Soundtrack is awe inspiring. Feels epic and gritty when it needs to be.+A lot of options to lay a path to victory.+Online support (I have a couple of old friends who also used to play the game so we still throw some Online/LAN parties).+Campaign storyline is actually pretty good. Like Tolkien kind of good.Cons:-No AB or SoD campaigns as mentioned before. Sad.-If you are not familiar with the franchise or played the original game back in the day it might be very boring/unappaling to you visually compared to the alternatives you may have in 2017.-Fullprice is kind of too much to ask for, personally I grabbed it on a sale.-Number of maps for Co-op campaigns kind of falls short.Overall:Duckton of replay value, countless ""just one more turn""s, a lot of fun and intriguing if you have friends to play with and ofcourse nostalgia for the fans of the franchise. My vote might be a bit biased but after all; 8/10. Just because they do not have the DLCs I will not throw a tantrum. You should read before buying any product, including games. So if you do not stop whining Sandro the Great will throw your family into the Skeleton Transformer."

(Necropolis Zombie Joke)I must have spend my youth on 3 games- Diablo II, Age of Empires and Heroes of Might & Magic.I was so excited as to what the HD would bring, however this is only the vanilla version of the game, and a lot of content is missing.You can get it here though:Get it onGoG.cominstead.Thumbs UpYou veterans don't care about the HD because ""hey, we grew up with the pixies"" (Conflux joke) and it's still one of the best games in my opinion.The upgraded graphic is still a nice touch; however it's like putting make-up on a pretty girl, not the biggest change, and you might not even look further than her chest.Multiplayer is actually good and easy to play among steam-friends.However playing multiplayer against strangers often leads to people quitting during the first few minutes, if the map isn't in their favor.You have all the creatures, spells, and buildings like in the old days, except Conflux is missing. - The whole diversity in skills and stats which still makes this game one of the best strategy games in history.7 campaign scenarios, around 50 skirmish maps, a local multiplayer mode and a map editor.You can play in windowed mode - good for watching movies while waiting for your opponent.Thumbs DownThis is not the complete expansion, meaning you don't have the Armageddon's Blade & The Shadow of Death expansions.No Conflux, which is really needed against an op Necropolis player.It's cheaper to buy this game on GoG and you even get the expansions there.You can't revisit places by space-bar, you have to run back and forth and loose movement. Often not a big deal, but can determine a win or loss.Apparently you can't install or create mods for this game on steam - I don't care much for it, but a lot negative reviews include this.You can't change the difficulty in the campaigns, so it was really easy to beat, since I've done it before in the past #no_life.Closing CommentsStill one of my favourite games, but it's really not worth buying it here on steam, when you can't have a thousand half-naked pixies.How to beat 10 games on each difficulty easily.You have to beat 10 games on each difficulty, which can be done quick -Since the game auto-saves, you can just reload your auto-save and beat the same game in ""1 turn"", it will count.I read that cheat-codes work for achievements in normal games, but not in the campaigns - but I haven't confirmed that."

The gameplay captivates you and you would spend countless amounts of hours playing it without realizing so much time passed by from raising up an army/heroes, map exploration, resource gathering, and strategically approaching challenges each and every unqiue map has to offer, some with unique win conditions.  The diversity of the playstyle each starting town has to offer and deep hero pool to work with allows lots of freedom in variation while at the same time the RNG in hero recruitment/starting town structures, makes it so that you need to work with what you got and pushes for tactical consideration for optimal pathing/decisions.What makes this game so lackluster is that your buying the base game with no expansions and so the maps/campaigns that are available feel very limited, especially when there is a completed digital copy of the game available for purchase on GoG for $10.

Then go get the HOMM3 HD mod and install that. You will fall in love with it all over again.Like when you select a building to recruit it is maxed out by default, so just hit buy. OR you can click the town icon in the bottom left and that gives you an option to buy all creatures in one go.Two heroes meet, there are ""transfer armies"" and ""transfer artifacts"" buttons now. I love it.The HD mod is amazing and it's a must have. I play in 1080p now and you can see so much of the map. Going back to the 800x600 feels restrictive now.If Ubisoft had any plans to release the expansions I'd say support them so we can get them, but they have said the source code is gone. So at this point, hit upGOG.comthen get the HD mod. Have a blast reliving the rush you get when Orange comes up and takes your gold mine, and you swear you will wipe Orange from the history books for this attack upon your economy!"

Better than its ancestor and its succesor, even the HOMM VI itself. For me, HOMM III is my childhood memories. In early 2000 my uncle introduce this game to me, and in one week, I already addicted to this game and my childhood is full of fantasy about angels, devils, dragon, titan, behemoth, hydra, and many more.As the time goes by, I decided to play Campaign and finish the storyline, and I must say, the storylineespecialy Shadow of Death and Armageddon Bladeis not a cheap storyline like other fantasy adventure, the storyline much more like noveltry and its awesome.Almost ten years goes by after the last time I play HOMM III, in those ten years I was hoping that Ubisoft create new HOMM which is still awesome like HOMM III, and then I thought,""why not a remake of this game with HD definition? this thing is famous nowdays""Heroes of Might & Magic III - HD Edition:And then here it comes theReturn of the LegendsI was dissapoint at HOMM III - HD Edition in Steam's Review Page. So many people dissapoint with the graphic, some people still find the graphic hasn't changing. Well, at the first time I install and play HOMM III - HD Edition, I had a same thought, and then I open my old HOMM and make a comparasion, and Im impressed of how well the improvement actualy is. The problem was in our way of seeing. We grow up with a lot of games that make a lot of improvement in every year, so the classic game look so awful.I think this case is same like the Fallout 4 problemMy HopeI was grateful that I could play this game again in 2015 with a HD Remake.I hope that Ubisoft also make the Shadow of Blade and Armageddon Blade Edition.I dont care if its come as DLC for this Restoration of Erathia, or its come as diffrent game, I believe HOMM true fans will buy and play it, because Shadow of Blade and Armageddon Blade has a better storyline and game improvement.I also hoping that in someway, Ubisoft also included the Wake of God edition, eventhough it was a fan made. Im sure that if Ubisoft collaborate and make this Wake of God edition, the WOG edition will come out as a perfect Heroes Edition.My Rating for this Game:Much Childhood Memories! 9.5/10"

,Recommended,297000,28657819,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,Syncourt,"The best in the series and an all-round classic.HOMM3 continues to display it's perfection even decades after it's creation. Many turn based strategy games only wish they could be as big as this one is. What makes this game amazing is it's army and unit diversity, each being visually and tactically unique, effective and fun. The simple mechanics behind the game make it very easy to learn while keeping turns quick which really helps the flow of the game in multiplayer.While the campaign mode is great on it's own, one of the best things about HOMM3 is it's 8 player multiplayer and infinite supply of randomly generated or user created maps. This HOMM3 HD does not actually include the map generator itself, but there are workarounds to get it working with this and guides to download a large number of the maps online. Mutiplayer can be played over LAN, Online and even hot seat on the single PC (great for when friends visit).The largest downside to HOMM3 HD is the lack of HOMM3 expansions. After decades of playing with the expansions it feels like a decent chunk of the game is missing. Those who have never played the original would not notice the difference though and realistically, there isn't actually that much missing.The newer HOMM games could all learn a thing or two from this one. This game was never about how stunning it looked, it was all about how much content it had and how well it played. The game didn't need to sell the armies to you in DLC chunks, people got them mainly just for the campaign and story alone. The game is well optimized for performance, never crashed and was mostly bug free. The AI armies could use a little work but AI wasn't really that advanced back then.Overall this is a great remake of the original HOMM3 but it is not really necessary to enjoy the game, the main attractions are just the visual improvements and being easier to set up online play. Without the expansions you would need to weigh up if that is worth sacrificing the expansions additional content for.Things I really enjoy about this game:Well written lore and story.Army and unit diversity.Infinite supply of random/user generated maps.Not overly complicated. Turns are fast.Hero skill customisation options allow for different playstyles.RPG mechanics allow you to make your heroes stronger and alter thier combat focus as the game progresses.Perfectly optimized and near entirely bug free.Great multiplayer.Can play hotseat on a single PC.Things I really dislike about this game:The only thing I really dislike about this game is the lack of expansion content."

Videos don't do justice to how nice it looks for an older game.  Overall it's a very slick experience. I like it a lot better than the newer games like Heroes VI, which feel bloated, and I'm convinced it cheats by magically giving the AI units it can't possibly produce that fast.  The absence of a random map generator or expansions is not a deal breaker for me at all.  The map editor is still there,  and there is no end to the number of user maps you can find online.  Personally I find the campaigns to be childishly written, and I don't play them.

Mostly the same actual gameplay however different kinda maps and objectives. There is also map editing, edit some maps or make entirely new ones :DSo this HD remake is pitching it as a whole new game, well not really, just HD rendered which I can't even tell on my current gaming screen, like I know it's supposed to be better and there is an option to turn on the old graphics, which of course turns it all fuzzy. The other added thing is the incorporated steam multiplayer which is very useful when trying to do games online.In summary a good game with many hours of gameplay, #3 in my opinion is better than all the rest, #5 comes the closest after that but the classic third is the best, I would fully reccommend purchasing for funs."

The scenarios provided by the game are enjoyable, but this HD-remake doesn't have the amazing replay value that the original game has, due to not having the ability to generate and play random maps - the mainstay multiplayer fun of the title, in my opinion.I have really mixed feelings about my purchase, after owning the HoM&M III Complete, as it feels very different without all the added content in the expansions. I will be 100% happy with this HD-remake after the expansions become available, and I really do hope they are being worked on.As the game stands of this moment, I would rate it 7/10, but has potential for a full 10/10 with the expansions."

Then why did I essentially buy Heroes III for the third time, giving Ubisoft, who has otherwise not treated this magnificent video game series with the respect it deserves, my not-so-hard-earned money? I've probably sunk more time into HoMM3 than any other game, and experiencing this brilliant game with high-resolution graphics is quite refreshing after playing it for well over a decade with sprites made for 800×600 screens. Unlike some other reviewers, I think DotEmu has actually done an excellent job upgrading the graphics (with a few minor exceptions). The gameplay is of course still there, as captivating and enjoyable as ever. The third instalment is the pinnacle of the series, and with the way games are made these days, there will probably never be anything quite like it again. I think this HD edition is the closest you'll ever get to a true 21st-century Heroes of Might and Magic game (not that Heroes IV is bad – it's just different), and that's worth getting, if you ask me."

Little to no visual performance increase, and the multiplayer is effectively useless. Tried playing coop with a friend after we both bought the new version, but you can't even see allies (or anything) when it's not your turn. So your friend gets into a battle, and you have to sit staring at a stationary map while you wait for them to finish.

Modern resolutions are supported without making pixels as big as your hand, and that in itself is something, but the game doesn't look ""better"" per se.To me, the key question is whether or not this is a game worth playing, and to this question the answer is ""yes"". It's amazing how well HoMM3 has held up over the years. It's by no means a ""complex"" strategy game, since you're basically juggling a few reasources so as to maximise your long term output, and trying not to get outmaneuvered by the opponent. But there's surprising depth to the battle layer, with tons of tricks that you can learn (or, as in my case, remember) that will help you prevail in what may otherwise seem like unwinnable scenarios. Balancing this many units (eight factions times seven units times two variants, plus a number of ""neutral"" creatures) is hard, and I'm truly amazed, both as a player and as a professional designer, by how many tricks HoMM3 manages to pull off. There are a number of ""spiritual successors"", but none of the ones I've played is a match, design-wise.The levels, that is - campaign maps, are well thought out as well. You will be constantly second-guessing yourself about whether you should explore that forest path, or maybe stick closer to one of your castles in case an enemy emerges from the tunnels. The addition of a second, underground layer has made the game essentially three-dimensional and added much to its dynamism, if not complexity. As a result HoMM3 doesn't take long to wrap your head around, yet it does take some time to master. It's a masterful balance of accessibility and challenge."

The addition of HD graphics has made it feel not as dated.Regarding gameplay the overall balance of units is pretty good but I did find that using the fast combat option seemed to have quite a difference on the numbers of units lost in battles for the better. Generally I have found that an aggressive approach gives better results than slowly build up armies.To be honest I did not pay much attention to the plot. It does tie in the various scenarios but in my oppinion the gameplay is more interesting.The long and short of it is that if you are looking for a fairly simple turn based game  and not really worried about storylines this is worth a go.

,Recommended,297000,14701470,"Posted: 28 February, 2015",all,weezact7,"Let me start by saying that there is a caveat to my recommendation of this game, but more on that in a minute. First, the game itself.Heroes 3 is, in my opinion, the best game of the series by a wide margin. It's tight, well-balanced, and offers lots of replay value with the map editor. If you've never played this game and you like strategy games, pick it up. You won't be sorry. Having it on steam makes it even easier to play with friends and, hopefully, will bring a good pool of custom maps from the community.That being said, this is only the base game. You can buy this PLUS two expansion sets for $10 on another website (the URL escapes me for the moment). This adds a new town type and a random map generator. Some people really like these features, I find them trivial. But it's still more stuff for less money. On the downside, you lose that steam compatibility aspect.So, do I recommend getting this? Yes. Do I think it's worth $15? No. If you're like me and $15 is chump change, get it anyway. If $15 is a lot of money for you or you can't justify spending more money on a game than it's worth, wait for a sale and get it 50% off or something. It's not like you'll have to wait long. Steam does them often enough."

There is a beautiful simplicity to being able to both plot out your movements, use strategy in both how you build your towns, how you control your armies, and the combat system, but to also be able to do this while in a relaxed and casual atmosphere.Sure there is the downside that this game does not include all of the great expansions to HoMM3 and sure you can get those if you buy the complete game on GoG, but at the end of the day multiplayer through steam is just the easiest way to enjoy this game without any headaches and additional 3rd party software.

As someone who plays his PC games on a 40"" screen, this HD version was necessary and greatly appreciated.Heroes III is one of my favourite games of all time, and easily my favourite strategy game. I've been playing it since I was 6 or 7 and never really stopped but in recent years, along with upgrading to bigger and higher reslolution screens, the games visuals increasingly looked pixellated and basically pretty damn ugly.I tried the unofficial HD mod but all that really did was increase the interface size and did very little for the actual textures themselves. Now with this HD version, the game looks beautiful and so it's as good as it's ever been.Are there flaws? Well yes. It doesn't include the expansions, the battles are still in 4:3 ratio (with borders) and a few of the repainted models look a bit derpy (I'm looking at you wood elves). But truly, this is a small price to pay for an old  game to look absolutely stunning. This breathes life in one of the best turn-based strategy games ever made.However I would appreciate it if Ubisoft added the expansions as DLC. And because of the price point I can see why people would rather just stick to the original version which you can get on GOG for a small fraction of the price of this HD version. My advice to you is to look at your monitor size. If it's 1080p and bigger than, say, 24"", then I recommend getting the HD version all day. Either way you can't really go wrong. Heroes III is still Heroes III."

The expansions are not available. People who want to download and play custom maps are not going to want HoMM 3 HD Edition, because most custom maps require the expansions to play.So what exactly do I like about it?I've never been so devoted to playing any HoMM game that I spend all my time with it. I have a lot of other games I like to play. When I do feel like playing HoMM, I will pick a version and spend a few weeks or a few months playing with it. Then, I move on to the next game.So, I guess you could call me a ""casual"" HoMM player, and I only am interested in single player mode. By the time I finish all the campaigns in Restoration of Erathia, I am ready to move on to another game. So, I might as well enjoy the Restoration of Erathia campaign with the best available graphics and remastering.I also own theGoG.comcomplete version, with the HD mod. I find that I like the new HD version better, especially since it doesn't shrink the interface so small, and doesn't zoom out so far. I play on an 82"" television screen, and the remastered character sprites are noticeably sharper to me than in the HD mod on theGoG.comversion.If I still feel like playing Blade of Armageddon and other expansions or downloaded custom maps after I finish Restoration of Erathia, I can move to theGoG.comwith HD mod version and continue playing, although I will miss the improvements from the new HD version.It doesn't have to be an either-or between the two versions. It can be a both-and. I will use the new version to play Restoration of Erathia, and enjoy lighting up the achievements and having the Steam support. Then I will switch to the other version if I feel like continuing.I've had no problems with stability issues nor found any bugs, either.I think my $15 was well-spent. That's less than the price of a home-delivered pizza dinner, and I'm getting weeks worth of much-enjoyed entertainment hours out of it."

No changes to textures/sprites/bitmaps.  So it's hardly the same thing.This HD edition is based on vanilla Heroes III that has only one campaign, Restoration of Erathia. Also, Random Map Generator was added in Armageddon's Blade, along with other additions like Conflux town, more artifacts, etc.I have GoG Complete version, even big box Heroes Complete Collection and I bought this too. It's a nice feeling to play the game that gave me so much wonderful memories. I've played the demo of this game for weeks even tho it was only one map with limited time.The only bad thing is that the chances are very slim for an HD edition for AB and SoD and maybe the price.This is the same game that many of us played back in '99 so don't hate it because Ubisoft is involved."

,Recommended,297000,14430183,"Posted: 11 February, 2015",all,frostbytes89,"You know what's really sad.. in 1999 3DO released Heroes of Might and Magic III. I played that game for _years_. Not only have I been playing it since I was around 9 years old, I've probably put thousands of hours into it altogether.That said, I have never seen a single bug. I'm not saying that they don't exist, but they sure as hell were not obvious. The game was so polished that to this day it remains the iconic and definitive version of the HOMM series.As we know, Ubisoft has done a remake of the game in HD. They claim to have repolished some 20k+ assets. I've played about 11 hours (according to steam) and in those 11 hours have noticed blatant, unacceptable, almost laughable bugs. Its so amazing what damage can be done to a product when the motive behind producing it is money, instead of the gratification of doing a good job and being proud of what you get to share with people.Example bugs:1. I went to move my battle dwarf, and instead of the battle dwarf moving sound, it played the death sound from an enemy unit I recently killed, _every_ _single_ _step_. And it wasn't just my dwarf! When the enemy moved his it played the same sound! Its as if the data got mixed up somehow. Maybe a dangling pointer? In any case, certainly no excuse for it considering the original never exposed an issue like that.2. These ""HD"" ground clutter sprites frequently bug out and cause the grid to be able to be highlighted and its color change to that of a valid state, as if you could move there. The old version correctly changed to the ""cannot move there"" cursor - every time.3. The game flat out stops when it receives WM_KILLFOCUS from the Windows message pump. Not ""stops rendering"" or ""stops audio"". I mean the game stops. It pauses everything. So you can't end your turn and do something else while the AI runs their turn. You can't even click on your castle and alt tab out to load a youtube video or something. Granted, not a bug, but totally unnecessary change.4.Arbitrary extremely weird glitches like a unit just jumping places for no reason and moving back.It just overall feels unpolished, untested, and unfinished. It was clearly released because after every single HOMM release since HOMM5, ubisoft has been flooded with comments from HOMM players expressing how far they have deviated from Heroes III and how they should just make that but updated.Well, Ubisoft did it. I still play it because the bugs aren't game breaking, its easy for me to run and keep game states, and its a good game that 3DO made. Its still fun despite the bugs! I feel like they took a group of intern artists for 6 months to do all the assets, and then a few engineers spent a couple months porting it over. Other than that, no love was given to the polish of the game. I get all happy when I load it up, but then just kind of frown inside and go ""..okay.. thanks for this I guess I'll take it.."" as I load up a map."

Now, before you get on the hate wagon, hear me out. I am a diehard heroes fan, I have played them all since the begining and just want to state this. Heroes 3 is off course, my favorite, and I really wanted to see it in HD. For this , I am grateful to Ubisoft that they did it. I like the new sprites and the graphical overhaul , you really can tell the difference especially on a bigger screen. Yes I am aware of the comunity patch too- this version does look better  because of the updated models. Now, could they have done more on these money and gave us the expansions? Definately, and with this I agree with the general consensus, they are stretching it... I would recomend this game on a sale, definately. The HD graphics and sprites do look sweet, for a Heroes 3 fanboy like me it does worth it. I did pay 15 euros and I am happy with my purchase so far. It is a decent price I think for a HD remake - many say is to much, but in the end, it is the producer's work that they put value on -  (they could have included the expansions though-that's my biggest beef with Ubisoft). The GOG version, yes that is very good, I have that version too, I buyed this for the HD overhaul, and in this regard it has not dissapointed me.@Ubisoft- Guys, I have paid the full 15 euros price on Steam, no keys from other retailers, no sale. My only request to you is this: Please make Armageddon's Blade and Shadow of Death HD too and put a decent price tag on them. I will buy them if you do, and I am sure many Heroes fans will, despite their negative comments here on Steam.

""They didn't add actual features to the game""- We all know that Ubisoft would have f*cked it up, if they did ;)- It's a freakin HD-Version, dafuq did you expect?3. ""It only shows the left upper corner of the game""- Disable the scaling of your screen and you're fine. Or change compatibility options for this specific .exe4. ""It only has 30 fps""- SERIOUSLY?!?!

""There is no LAN-support""- That's true, but hey, you have Steam.If you bought the game, without knowing that the addons (and all of their features [obviously]) are not included...well...then it's really your own fault.

Is it worth the price? That's yours to decide^^ <cough> Steam-Sales </cough>EDIT:I recieved more feedback on this review than I expected and I think I should clarify some things since I was in an angry mood, when wrote the above lines.I played and enjoyed Heroes of Might & Magic III since my childhood and I started playing it once again with the addons some time ago. I am not going to tell you that one version is better than the other, the simple reason for this is, that it depends on personal preferences which one to go with. When I was young I didn't have a random map generator, even better, I played the same map over and over again with my friends (Realm of Chaos) and I assure you it was great fun.It is in fact very unfortunate that they lost the source code of the addons. I would be angry too, if they sold the addons later as DLCs, but I am sure they would have implemented them if they could.For me, The Restoration of Erathia is the heart and the soul of this game and I am very happy to see it shining with better texture quality :) The price might be discussable, I give you that, but in the end it depends on what you want.If you feel that the random maps (even though I didn't really like them, because they are...well...generic) are essential for the game or that you cannot enjoy this masterpiece without Conflux, the neutral creatures the artifacts and let us not forget the mod-addons ""Wake of Gods"" and ""Horn of the Abyss"" than feel free to buy the GoG-Version.I personnaly can live without the addons and mods (btw. I didn't like Conflux. I want to see ""Forge"". I mean this is a Science-Fantasy-Universe after all, as we saw in Might & Magic VI ""The Mandate of Heaven"", which you should play too).I only want a more beautiful version of the original and that is, what I got. Is that enough for you? Maybe not, but I am not the one to judge that. Have fun playing what ever version you want <3"

Thank you :)I have been reading quite some reviews now, and as far as i can see, none of them recommends this game. I can agree with most of them, since i am a HUGE Heroes 3 fan, I have played it for as long as I can remember, and it's a shame to se content lost. For example the random map generator that everybody loves, and just admit it, it could not have been hard to just add it. But I have also read alot of reviews saying that there is a lot of bugs and clitches, but me and two of my friends have been playing for some hours and no one of us has experienced that, the game itself runs flawless, over the internet.Though it's true that I prefer the gameplay of Heroes 3 Complete I think that this is a step in the right direction. I highly recommend this for people who havn't played the game before, and I do enjoy the graphical changes. What I really hope for is that Ubisoft can see all these reviews and add all the features that we all miss, and add the expansions for free, and they will se many of those red thumbs turn green.But just remeber, doing this was better then doing nothing, because going via Steam secures a future for the game."

That may be true, but if you do have the original HoMM 3  that map creator has that feature, and you just make sure to make a Restoration of Erathia map and save the files into HoMM 3 HD map folder, I've done this and it works just fine.No there is no expansions available, but from what I heard and understand that was never announced to even be added with this game remake, if anyone actually bought it before reading up on that then it's on you, I'd strongly recommend this to anyone who has time to kill and don't want to deal with the whole Gameranger crap.And obviously I can't speak for everyone about the bugs, I guess I'm fortunate and Ubisoft will have to fix this cause I do agree that the price is indeed quite ridiculous for not having the expansions and the bugs people seem to have.But all in all, I'd recommend this game to anyone still."

I still remember amazement that came with buying first Magog, succesful completion of Key to Victory, cheating (yes, i did it! for some time). It became my favourite game immediately.And now, it came back. With a bit of diffrence.Title says it's HD. To be honest, I haven't noticed much change at first - some units had more details, everything looked a bith more smooth - but devs allowed players to decide if they want to see the game in HD or as it was when it firstly came out. And then, you can see how much they did. Job well done.Apart of graphics, nothing has been changed in game mechanics - and bless the devs. So if you are H3 Veteran, and would love to see RoE in new clothes - buy it. If you have only heard of H3 - buying this game would be the best you could do - you just wouldn't miss Addons content - game is great even without them.One thing i'd love to know - will addons be relased?

This is actaully the first good thing they have done in awhile, releasing Heroes 3, the one Heroes game most who played it loved, They know that people loved this game that why they are releasing it now, because they took heavy hits last year.However I bare you some bad news and this is all from my fond memory when I used to play Heroes 3 without it's DLC, The Orignal without DLC never even have A Map Maker, only with Later DLC it did. so with that chances are their will be DLC not free however.On the other hand you maybe thinking ""Oh I can just get the Orignal or Collecters and play that on my Computer"" good luck with that, you see the old game even with Collecters (Which I own currently) chances are you may expreance Crashes quite often due to the age of the game and it has not been Optimized for newer computers. HD fixs those problems, hence why I brought it, not to mencion play the game with another Heroes fan that loved this game as a kid.So in Summary, chances are there maybe DLC ""Maybe"" not like the DLC gave you Map Maker, A New Faction to play with, More Heroes and more Creatures.

Stop giving negative reviews because you can't even make the effort to see that it's not complete.Anyway it is a great game and the HD uplift does make the game look lovley. The turn based style and battling are great and can entertain hours on end. Now it isn't complete so $15 is kind of a lot. The game has decent depth, but seeing how you can buy the complete version that has 2 full expansions at GOG for $10 it makes this game not seem worth the buy. If you're a die hard fan like me, you'll get it anyway. If you're on the fence, you should wait for a sale. It's good enough for me to vote positive, but Ubisoft should release the expansion packs, and the random map generator.Pretty much, if you have the complete version, you may want to give this port a pass.

The music is the same between original and HD release.  There are 4 combat soundtracks, and 3 is the annoying one.  It isn't that annoying if the sound is turned down some.  Once I had similar sound levels between computers, they sounded identical.  While I haven't seen all units yet, the only one that I consider worse than the original is the pikeman.  The rest seem fine to me.Here is the old review:This is my first impression after playing for 20 minutes.  I have a KVM setup so I can switch between the old version on a Windows XP machine, and the new version on Windows 7, viewing both on the same monitor.My first impression was positive.  The initial screens looked better and more crisp.  The color palette is the same, bright colors that made the original artwork charming.  I then navigated to the combat screen, and that is where I went to a negative rating for the game.  The art for the pikeman was pretty bad.  The archer was ok, and I didn't notice anything glaringly bad about the enemies I was facing.What I found really annoying was the combat music.  On the original version, the music had deeper tones and a good pace.  On the new version, it was this annoying high pitched instrument (flute maybe?).  The pace seemed slightly faster too, making me feel agitated.  Considering that you hear the combat music over and over in this game, bad music can get very annoying.  I am trying to decide if the newer graphics are worth the bad music.  I think my initial feeling is that I would rather play the original.On the positive, this is supported for Windows 7, so if my XP machine dies, at least I have an option to continue playing it.P.S.  The intro video did not appear updated.  I am not surprised, as it would have been a major undertaking for little value."

The Erathia base game is pretty much the same as the Complete eddition, aside from small few things. The most important things missing are: unit hotkeys (most people won't notice), artifact combination (happens rarely anyway), 1 town (the worst one at that, but beautfull), random map generator (not for long, as someone is making one), a few other heroes, and a few units), and obviously the campaign, but that's not why you're getting this game anyway. The multiplayer works well, but you do need to go to Firewall and add exception rule for 3 ports (given in the manual of the game that you can find on steam). Overall, the product is an 8/10.PRO:-Most of the stuff works well, the game has slight lag but you probably won't notice it.-MULTIPLAYER :D-Price is alrightCON:-They could have just made the campaign withing a month or 2 tops... (this might come if the game sells well though)-slight lag, and slight things missing compared to complete eddition is a slight pain point-MULTIPLAYER: No ladder??? Also, 8 people can join a 4 player game, and the game doesn't always load on first or even 2nd try... Given that I run powerful rig with fast internet, next to the servers, i shouldn't be experiencing problems, hence we can tell that the problems stem from the poor software or servers (probably software..., duh...)-No replay function, nothing new what so ever.... THe graphics look slightly improved, but I'd rather see stable multiplayer and a rehall of the game without changing any of the gameplay features...DESCISION:Buy if you enjoy multiplayer with random people. DO NOT buy if you're expecting it to be perfect or if you're not a fan of HoMM 3 series because this is not a good representation of the potential that this game carries."

It is not because this was a bad HD touch-up. It is due to me wanting to play Hereos but, since I was kind of alone on it, I needed the campaigns to have some fun. This version really has no campaigns to work with so I went with the GOG version and played a ton of that.Side note: Hereos Chronicles is fantastic. I absolutely love this series. They are a little bit easier than I would like, but the story is just oozing charm. They are also quite long! GET THESE.I stand by that this was a good HD remake. The sprite touch-ups are wonderful. However, if you play strategy games solo, you might just want to go for the GOG version. IF you do.... check out Chronicles! I wish I could buy that lot again.*Edit Over*I loved this game. I loved it all my life. When I was a little child up to right now, I have been playing this game for decades. When I saw this was coming to steam, I bought it instantly. For those who say ""blah blah go to gog and buy it there and better..."", sure... you go buy it there. I want it here on steam, so I can play with my friends, not on gog.Okay, onto the review. To start with, the graphics got an interesting update! The castles (towns) look fantastic. They have a nice touch up and makes it look much better. The individual sprites also look nice! They do have a new look to them, but it is not bad. I was expecting to hate this but it turned out I actually like it! The combat screen looks nice and everything has a decent touch up. However, if you do not like the graphical changes, you can select the original graphics in the menu inside game. This will change it back to what you remember as from over a decade ago.What about the music and sounds? Did they mess up the fantastic composition of Paul Romero? No they did not! It is still the same great music you have heard for more than the last decade from many JVC games.Does the multiplayer work? YES! It does! It is easy and you do not have to type in IP adresses anymore. It can be a tad bit sluggish at times, but it is definitely livable and stable.All in all, I definitely think this game was worth 15$. In fact I would buy it again. There is no where near enough JVC games on steam. In fact, MM10 added MM6, and Homm3 was just released- these are the only JVC games on steam that I know of. This game is the pinnacle of turn based strategy games. I am certain others will love it too.New graphic rating- 9/10, I loved 90% of the changes and having the option to go back to old settings anytime I want sold it for me.Sound/Music- 10/10, no changes here, but there needed to be none. I loved these tracks and I would hate to see them get changed. I am relieved that this did not happen.Online- 8/10, It can be a little sluggish but it is all good. No more IPs, No more trouble playing with friends.Gameplay- 10/10, Thankfully unchanged and perfect the way it is.Content- 6/10, No expansion, missing map generator and Conflux, as well as various artifacts and creatures. All of this you can live without, but hopefully this gets patched in. If it does, I will come back and edit this section off.Overall this game revival gets an 8.5/10. Definitely worth your money. I can already tell that I will spend hundreds of hours playing this whenever I get free time."

Ubi has continued to stain might and magic name ever since they bought the rights, with creating a new universe even though they had the scripts for the next few games from NWC. This game however on release has some.. 'features' i rather do not enjoy.first of all, once you upgrade a dwelling, you can't buy the 1st monsters. this is a large factor when you are low on gold, and cannot afford the upgaded version. ""HD"" is a way to put it.. maybe ""differant"" would be a better way to fraze it? some things look stretched or like they have new detail in them that wasnt there before, making them not the same item. now, on this next one, i am not 100% sure on, but i belive the view is smaller here than it was one HoMM complete. maybe that's just the 'HD mod' talking. this is simply RoE, not SoD or AB! buyer beware!Let's look at the good things now- has multiplayer on steam (even if it is much more limited).- still has map editor! hooray for community!- you can see how long you haven't been sleeping thanks to steam keeping track of those pesky hours...- available on tablets for those long care rides when you're 3-hour PC battery life doesnt cut it.- it's heroes! play the goddamn game already!I can only hope they release some sort or patching tools so modders unlike myself can add SoD and such to make the gamplay more rich. with all this information, i suggest buying the game, but not for $15 USD. $10 at most."

Bugs on the horizon for some time did not appear, but those rare that were in the original and not corrected, such as to non-damage to the city moat, high prices on the black market, the spell flight - bumping into the castle with guards but without the hero could fight with his copy of the hero and others. And, the price is unreasonable, a maximum of $ 5, anyone would agree.If you are a fan of Heroes this reissue you like.But personally, I'm glad about one of the best strategies to remember.RU: Герои великолепны, а с новой графикой еще лучше. <br>Разработчики увеличили разрешение в 2 раза, нарисовали картинки существ и их анимацию (хоть и местами немного поддергивающая).<br>ОБРАТИТЕ ВНИМАНИЕ: DotEmu взял за основу Герои III Возрождение Эрафии - первое из дополнений и там не было: генератора случайных карт, покупки обычного существа в улучшеной постройке, охраны ресурсодобывающих объектов и т.д. Все это было в двух следующих дополнениях, но разработчики писали что код от них был утерян, но это уже другая история... <br>Да, перерисовали хорошо, но они не до конца выполнили свою задачу переиздания - исправление ошибок. Багов на горизонте некоторое время не появлялось, но те редкостные что были в оригинале так и не поправили, вроде ненаносящего урона ров города, завышенные цены на черном рынке, заклинание полет - налетев на замок с охраной но без героя можно было драться со своей копией героя и другие.

Now I can still enjoy it, for it is strategic and heavy time consumer. HD does not seem to me like obvious improvement. Game still looks old but playable very much on Windows 10. However, animations and sounds in combat sometimes do strange things, nothing game breaking. It has some backstory and if you like Might & Magic RPG series, you may also like this strategy counterpart. Both game types are in the same universe, potentially in the same era. Story is acceptable and I was never too much excited about it. If you also like Disciples III, you would like Heroes III."

Playing the old school version of this game was the most amazing fun.However, this incomplete, expansionless HD remake is still great, don't get me wrong, but the old expansion campaigns and factions were the reason I wanted this remake on Steam so bad.Now I'm not too sure how I feel without an expansion pack available, or plans to make one."
,Recommended,297000,32334568,Posted: 10 June,all,Lycan,"This game is simple. Manage a kingdom in a turn based, board game type style in a beautiful landscape while building an army in order to crush your enemies in different scenarios. Easily one of my favorite childhood games and still a favorite to this day. Atmosphere and soundtrack are also really good since the overworld music is nice, quiet, and calm. Whereas battle music is fast paced and heavy. The different kingdoms to choose from also offer a good variety so you arent constantly making the same army over and over again. While not the best version of HoMM3 since you can get the same game but with expansions fromGOG.com, this game is still dope. It may seem slow at times and might take you a bit to get into but its amazing especially with friends since you start to plan more on how to manage your kingdom/army while plotting to get rid of other kingdoms. The GOG version is also cheaper but to play with friends you will all need Gameranger and will have to set up games with that. But if you dont wanna go through all of that (even though it isnt a lot) then just buy the steam version.so all in all-GOG.com'sversion is cheaper and comes with expansions but online requires Gameranger and isn't in hd (i believe)BUT- the game is in hd- the online is easy and fast as hell to set up with friends- there arent any bugs or game breaking glitches from which i have seen"

High point of the series- However, this is a pretty half hearted ""remake"". Didn't include the expansions or the RMG (Random Map Generator).- Sprites are now higher resolution and multiplayer has been modernized (MP was originally designed for Dial-Up internet so I remember having to type each others IP Address' in to play with a friend back in the 90's)There are sequels to this game but they're essentially all terribleHeroes 4 - Too many drastic changes to gameplay. Lost most of the fanbase at this pointHeroes 5 - Tried damage control and going back to the heroes 3 formula. It was 'alright', but new changes like the 3D graphics changed the atmosphere quite a bit. It wasn't terrible but even if you want this one the multiplayer is no longer supported. Go figure.Heroes 6-7 - Ruined by Ubisoft with ""Uplay"". You have to sign into this ridiculous 3rd party launcher while you play. Uplay always screws up and causes problems, making multiplayer a struggle. The games themselves actually aren't bad though, as they've been trying to copy Heroes 3 ever since.If you want to play a modern game in this genre, I highly recommend Endless Legend, or Age of Wonders 3.Cheers"
