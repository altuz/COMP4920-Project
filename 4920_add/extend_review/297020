I really don't understand why it has 75% positive reviews; gameplay gets stale by the third level, art is awkward and tacky, main character is the embodiment of stinky Texan redneck stereotypes... I've put 3.3 hours into it, completed 100%, achievements included.Got it for free and I tell you I'd be angry if I had paid for it. Avoid."

Speech in the game is sub-par at best. Gets annoying even after 10 minutes of it. Wait for a big sale if you absolutely MUST get this game."

This baby doesn't disappoint - especially if you can grab it during a Steam Sale like I just did. The atmosphere, humor, sound and feel of the action all come together to form a pretty hilarious and addictive package of nonsensical carnage. If you dug games like Zombies Ate my Neighbors and Smash TV, pick this one up. It doesn't have the exploration they did, but the feel is right at home."

Game isn't very good. A shooter but shooting is done poorly. Sometimes bullets pass through one target and hit one behind. Mostly a game about knowing when to reload. Also can't reload while moving.  More frusterating than fun.

The gameplay itself is repetative, with level after level of Cow Culling as one would expect from the title. Basics of the game include upgrading your weapon so as to blast the oncoming waves of cows, hippies and fat goth chicks. You would think that the gun upgrades would keep the game fresh for a little longer, but every level the upgrades are reset, and thus you just find yourself picking your favourite upgrades at the start of each level time and time again.Honestly this game is not worth the money they are asking. I got it with a 75% discount coupon, and even then I am wondering whether what I have recieved is worth it. If you purchase this game, get it for the cards (which is why I orginaly purchased it), and not for the gameplay, but it is quite a steap price merely for cards."

I was hoping for a dumbed down version of PvZ, but nope, nothing even remotely close. Sloppy controls and an non-intuitive interface result in mostly frustrating gameplay. Even when it is not frustrating, it is boring. I played it with a controller BTW.Nothing fun at all here for me."

That's it.The Culling of the Cows it's built around a couple simple notions: shooting things up is fun, and nobody wants to be eaten by undead cows. The game is interesting for a while, but that fades away sooner than later, thus the thumbs down. Keep in mind that the price you pay for it is a big factor: if you get it cheap, the relation cost-value can make the purchase worthy.Credit is due to the developers for trying hard to keep this game interesting for its duration, adding elements and in-game mechanics aimed at keep things interesting, but it wasn't enough to do the trick. Again, if you are not a thirty-year older that has seen a fair share of this kind of games, your opinion may be different."

Not just any zombie, but cows... freaking COWS!The game is pretty straight forward. You move and shoot. And shoot like your life depended on it. As a matter of fact, it does. You get your various ammo upgrades and some other upgrades to help you manage those incoming zekes. But, heres the best part. You get assists, ranging from 1 to 4, based on which stage you are on. You just shoot, reload and shoot some more.So, I highly recommend that you buy this game(wait for the sale though). And you kill some zombies and the odd badger or two. Goodluck."

I can't remember how much money I must have spent on it, but even if you get it for free it's absolutely not worth it.Controls are rubbish, they cannot be changed.Item upgrades have no description anywhere, so you just have to guess.The hit detection is worse than the Holocaust.You can have power-ups or credits dropped from the sky but, again, nobody tells you that this function exists, or what each one does.There are cheat codes but they must be entered while you're fighting. You die before you can finish typing.The content is tiny, very badly done.The voice acting is one of the worst I've ever seen. And I'm not comparing it to AAA games. No. I mean this is terrible, beyond comparison. If a deaf person heard this game after getting their hearing back, they'd kill the surgeon.The music lasts 20 seconds and loops infintely, burning your brains out.There are only 5 achievements and they only require you to press a button. Stupider than Jayden Smith.It is a very poor copy of Plants vs Zombies, where you have to protect your farm (instead of house) from zombie cows AND normal zombies. But instead of having a strategy you have to remember what 12 different keys do, but also pay attention to how much money you have, otherwise you cannot press them. Plus, some have cooldowns! All of this while you're moving around the map with WASD.Oh, by the way, you have to reload constantly, but reloading takes LONGER than enemies to kill you. And this is not explained anywhere, either.It seems it's going to be a joke about rednecks, but it feels like it was made by rednecks instead.It's not even bloody enough. It feels worse than those flash games from 1997 which took 10 hours to load and then had less features than Pong. Worse than those PowerPoint chain emails they send you, which after 10 minutes of loading and scrolling through endless mail addresses, are not even funny.At first I thought I should be supportive of an indie game. Maybe they haven't got a clue how to make a game, or they just don't have the team. But I've seen Audiosurf come out of ONE person's work. And it's brilliant. You can't get more indie than Grezzo 2, and it's hilarious. If you want badly-done-on-purpose, there is Goat Simulator. Even Garry's Mod. This is just vomitive. Especially when you consider it's 9 pounds. 9 POUNDS! Which is around 13-15 dollars. For this!!And no. I don't write reviews lightly. I usually play for at least 20 hours before thinking I can give my opinion (feel free to check my other reviews). But honestly, after 5 minutes, there is nothing else to be seen.I just spent the following 40 minutes trying to get the last achievement.I'm really sorry, but for the first time ever, I'm going to award a game a negative score. -1/10 Run.

It's not perfect and it certainly feels that way when you're trying to align your shots in the path of a enemy. There are shots that miss that I could have sworn would get me a kill. Other than that, the game is so much damn fun. Great 2D shooter that keeps the action coming. Not sure if casual is the term to use for a game like this as it actually gets pretty intense at times."

The hit detection is really spotty and some elvels you ""defend against waves"" of enemies but have no idea how many waves that is.When you die (due to spotty hit detection, usually never your fault) you'll end up frustrated having to grind through multiple boring waves again and again.The game also punishes you for using any of its features (most levels give you extra cash for not upgrading the gun/using any powers..... so..... why would you need cash if that is the unlock requirements every time?).It really just gets boring pretty quick once you realize nothing in it ever changes.
