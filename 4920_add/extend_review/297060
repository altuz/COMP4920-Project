,Recommended,297060,10194953,"Posted: 21 May, 2014",all,Hemmingjay,"Since I can't leave a review on the store page for some unknown reason, I will post here. When I first decided to write a review I had every intention of criticizing the devs for releasing the game Early Access instead of just waiting until they had enough content. This was due to my own prejudice against companies that have been putting tech demos up on the store and charging full price. The truth is that Freaking Meatbags already has a good amount of content and many of the game's features. At $10 it's priced perfectly right now.About the game itself;The first thing you will notice is the humor. This is Douglas Adams meets Paranoia in the most flattering manner possible. The art is loveably cute and the writing is snappy and clever. It sets a different tone for what is essentially a RTS/Tower Defense game with a mutation mechanic thrown in for extra fun. From the start it all just works.The graphics are fitting for the current trend towards retro-glaucoma bitart. Everything is well crafted to be easily identifiable and often charming. This is a talented artist/art director. I have not seen any artifacts or glitches. I can't wait to see more from them in the near future as more content is added.Audio: Forgive me I had to play with the sound off since I couldn't stop playing through the night. From the looks of things I probably missed out on something great. I hope to update later today after I get some sleep.Gameplay: As I said, it's basically an RTS- resource collection, build buildings, create units, set defenses but then it adds a tower defense element by throwing invasion waves at you. Each planet you land on gives you an increasing number of waves of attacking enemies. Sometimes a planet will be a special level instead(no spoilers!). The waves come from different directions and are made up of increasingly hard enemies and larger numbers. Finally, there is a DNA splicing element to the game. It's in the latest build but it's not completely ""fleshed out""(sorry) yet since you don't have a ton of options for splicing but it looks like it will be really great addition once done.Overall, the game is currently worth supporting. The direction of development seems consistent and the devs seem friendly. I am eager to try out the rest of the game as I have had several hours of addiction fueled bliss already. I am sleep deprived but I had to get a review up ASAP so that these guys will hopefully get the sales they deserve. There has been a flood of garbage on Steam recently but this isn't like all of that. Buy this and enjoy!"

Doing this allows the player to choose genial traits for the clone such as faster mining, improved tower fire rates, damage and so on.- Music is really nice although it does only have a few tracks.- Mixes gameplay up by having 'shooter' sections\elements. It's nice that it has this but I don't really see the need for it.Cons- There is no in game options menu so if you want to change anything you'll be required to go back to the main menu.- The control scheme on the planet hub is just terrible. Instead of using the mouse to move the camera around until you find the desired planet you must use A\D or Left\Right arrow. This wouldn't be a problem if planets were in static positions, however they are not and are constantly moving so to find the planet you want to play becomes a search for a needle in the haystack. Why can't we use the middle mouse to pan the camera.- The difficulty is highly inconsistent and often fluctuates. One level you'll beat no sweat while the next you'll suffer through. What's up with that?- If you placed a tower down your robot can not pass over it. This is extremely annoying, this often unintentionally leads to you taking the long♥♥♥♥♥way around if possible unless you've locked yourself in which could happen until you decide to recycle whatever is impeding your path.- Camera control during gameplay is somewhat slow as it either follows the player or can be temporarily moved by pushing the mouse in the desired direction, it does however return to the center on the player. I wish you could pan the camera around with middle mouse button.- AI humans feel the need to wander all over the place after you've designated them to a given position which could result in their deaths.- I often get the feeling that I have to play this game the way the devs intended it to be played. If not you're most likely in for defeat.- The game drops frames when a ton of chips are collected or many explosions occur.- Lacking in enemy robot variety.- Can get repetitive early on.Oversights- There is no encyclopaedia of towers, defences, robots or aliens. So if you missed what a certain tower does or robot statistic you may be required to replay the level that first introduced the mechanic or hover over every tower\defence\resource in your arsenal.- Power constraint is a nice restriction however I wish there a button to disconnect all towers at the same time because if you have towers away from your ship and enemies are attacking your ship you have to manually disconnect all the distant towers and this involves walking to them to turn them off. This will result in an instant defeat.- I wish you could fuse the DNA of aliens with aliens, I don't see why you're limited to only humans in this aspect as you con recruit other aliens to your team.- It needs a better worker selection implementation. As in being able to select one worker from a group when all workers are grouped together. Something like a worker list in which you could click on any worker.- It does have some typos or missing words.VerdictA game that tries to merge the aspects of RTS and Tower Defence genres and while it succeeds in some aspects, it does fail in others. The result is a fun but flawed experience which is marred by odd design decisions, infuriating usability issues, uneven difficulty and idiotic AI. While it's not terrible it is quite fun but the flaws really ruin the experience. I do feel that it needed more time in the oven to correct its issues."

But it mainly needs more content .I beat the game in 25 hours, a lot of time, some times leaving the game untended, but half of that time was replaying old levels to get cash so I could buy upgrades, only one bonus level is in the game that I could find, and only FOUR aliens.Over all: Good game for those who want a cute game that lets you build some."

It's a shame this game hasn't recieved more exposure.I have a few minor criticisms, such as the lack of achievements, a bit short, and overall could use some more polish such as additional DNA traits. It would be amazing to see a sequel building on this formula.If you enjoy this game I HIGHLY(!) recommend playing Infested Planet, which is a very similar and probably superior TD / RTS experience."

I thought the level before the boss was tough..but the boss was much tougher.Overall a very good game. I'd give it a 82 out of 100 in the state that it is in. Would love to play some more levels.

,Recommended,297060,16438377,"Posted: 16 June, 2015",all,Jsshinoda,"Adding my own review into this game to help support it. I would recommend buying this game if you like more than a simple tower defense. This game inputs many options and a variety of things to do in place of simply placing towers. You upgrade your 'meatbags', get drones for yourself, set up towers and place people in them that make the towers super powerful. It's simple, it's fun, it's an RTS tower defense, not sure what else to say."

,Recommended,297060,33735881,Posted: 22 July,all,Cyriel ᛭ᚲᛃᚱᛁᛖᛚ᛭,"A very fun and extremely enjoyable journey through space in the form of a splendidly executed Tower Defense game.The gameplay progression is very enjoyable.You're given limited resources almost always and time is short, so you're to make the most of what you have and think critically. Pacing is very well done, introducing something new almost every map, however most things won't see the light of day very often, which is kind of a shame.The element of cloning / messing with humanoid DNA is surprisingly well done and easy to figure out, but hard on decision making early game. Sadly the majority of the time you'll stick with the same setup, and once you get a certain DNA type, you're steamrolling over everything, so that might have been a bit over the top.Music and sound effects are splendid. Fits the overall theme and general feel of the game and doesn't tire very easily. I suspect that if you're a grinding kind of person, it might get old a bit but overall it's very nicely implemented.The graphics are plain yet functional. Enemy design is amazing, and general aesthetics are pleasant to the eyes. No sharp contrasts, little pieces of decor left and right, very fun :)Sadly like almost everything, there are some downsides to this awesome title as well.- Some DNA unlocks are vastly overpowered even from the getgo. There are a few that are just gamebreaking and they even joke about removing the one that has the biggest impact.- There's a giant friggin laser that pierces and has tons of potential, yet you cannot rotate it. This is such a shame.- The game is very very short overall. With some tactical insight you won't have much problems clearing each mission, and ""very hard"" isn't really very hard. Hard isn't excessively hard either.Overall it's in the very positive for me. A fun little break from other things with a light yet sensible story about a day in the life of a robot employee. (sadly the ending sort of wrecked the whole feel about ""no these are my humans and you won't touch them dammit"" and in my personal perspective that's a shame, but i see the design choice)Generally for people that are madly in love with tower defense / general strategy but this one is surprisingly ""entry level"" if that was ever a classification, so if you're new to the genre, this is absolutely for you :) It's somewhere between 4-8 hours in length depending how well you perform, so sadly nothing excessive, but worth the asking price.Great game, well executed, solid works. 8/10"

It's a dynamic TD game where the map challenges you to use different strategies each time. Graphics are a bit dated but the gameplay is pretty good for a TD game. Lots of humor in the dialog which keeps things fresh. Picked it up for $10.99 CAD. Haven't had any bugs so far. Items are still gonna be implemented. 9/10.

There are a couple bugs that could be fixed, a few spelling mistakes that made me feel like I was having an annurism, but the game overall is tons of fun. Wish there was endgame content, because once you beat the final boss there isnt a heck of alot to do.Other than that, a good buy!

The novel DNA mixing of meatbags is underwhelming and quickly resorts to two simple camps of miners and tower occupiers. The uncooperativeness of the meatbags fails to be fun or engaging, ending up as merely a nuisance which you pay to overcome with an upgrade. The navigation (relying on the view distance of your robot protagonist) limits map control in a way which is not used well enough to warrant the annoyance of maneuvering around obstacles and being unable to interact with far away units. I like what this game is trying to do but I don't think it ends up doing it very well."

It's definitely worth the buy.Video Review:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xbhjcwtuSAWhat is it?Freaking Meatbags is a comination of a tower defense game and a real-time strategy. You will have to command humans to mine rescources or man your combat towers while evil robots come to attack you. The most interseting part of this game is the gene splicing. You ae not stuck with just run-of-the-mill humans. You can change them, taking traits from two different humans and combining them to make a more specialized human.Pros:-The sense of humor in this game is whitty and spot on. Every time I get an email (which act as a way of furthering the plot) I always find something to chuckle over.-There is a massive amount of flexibility in how you design a human. I'm only half way through the game and I've found at least six genes and there are another seven in the shop. That leaves a lot of room for mixing and matching different genes.-The game is nicely paced. It is a fast paced game that somehow keeps up that pace between waves of enemies. I always find myself down to the wire as I put the finishing touches on my defenses.-The different enemies types are unique. Their not just the same enemy with different skins. This is a must have for a tower defense.Cons:-Missions where you are by yourself. *slight spoiler* There are missions in the game where you do not build towers. Instead you roam around a planet using drone guns to kill enemies. I don't find them interesting or fun. Luckily, they are over quickly.Overall, this is a great game. It's whit is amazing and the gameplay backs it up. It is well worth a cheap $10 price tag."
