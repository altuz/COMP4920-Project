Firing is placed in that most obvious of places - up on the d-pad. Boost is down on the d-pad.You can't set your own keybindings, so this is the format you're stuck with.Graphically, things are fine. It's no next-gen title, but what do you expect from a game that costs less the £3?It reminds me of Freelancer (a game I loved), but until they incorporate the mouse, or the triggers on the controller (they do nothing - the right bumper is 'pause') this game will just be too irritating to play."

In this game sometimes they work and make sense and makes things challanging, othertimes they just give me a headachewhile i really cant say that i like or hate it i cant recommend it; at least not until some of these things are fixed"

76561198054662331,Recommended,297100,18066283,"Posted: 16 September, 2015",all,Ben Argo,"I've given this game a positive review, despite some very clear issues.When I first bought the game, it's controller support was non-existent. About a month later, they updated. Since I could finally play with my gamepad, I decided to try it. About four missions in, the game suffers from an obnoxious turret scene which was not balanced or fun and terrible out of place in a dog-fighting game. BUT....-As many people pointed out, the music isn't terrible. I actually enjoyed it and didn't really notice a lack of variety. I was busy blasting fools with laser guns.-Many people complain about the voice-acting. Why? It is terrible, but it is also kind of funny (as in, so bad it is almost good). I am disappointed because it seems like a little more effort on the parts of the voice-actors could have improved everything, but really, the cheesy one-liners the characters deliver are sort of better when they aren't delivered seriously.-Bad/Linear Plot- The missions and overall story line are not very strong. Each mission is fairly short and I'm not really seeing much continuity seven missions in. But I got to shoot things in space in almost every mission and they were kind enough to add either amusing moments or serious ones to make me feel like there was a reason for shooting things in space.-My only real complaint is slow turning. The controls on the gamepad are fine (except for the right joystick controlling throttle in some unexplained way?) but the turning speed for some of these ships is monstrous. Every time I do a 180 manuever or just try a regular turn with the left joystick it seems like my ship and the screen is stuck in mud. It isn't lag, just slow turning. Weird. Not game-breaking though.-Super stupid turret mission. Hated it. I quit playing for 6 months after failing that so many times.Overall, this is an amusing game with good visuals. It should probably be bought on sale. But keep in mind (I think most of the negative views failed to remember this) its regular price is $4. This isn't a game that gets featured in Gaming Weekly. It's a bargain bin game made by a small group of artists and developers. They took the time to TRY and build something epic. They failed (it's good, but not epic). Instead of trying to scam us out of 20 bucks like some other steam 'developers', they put down a fair price and occasionally have sales. That's decent and you can't ask for a better bargain."

I don’t don’t know why they didn’t just use that for their trailer. I think that Disney might want their Star Destroyers back thoughSo what do you do in this game? You fly around from one waypoint to another Engaging enemies. Appears to be completely scripted Nothing spectacular or particularly original But blowing stuff up can be satisfying.Gameplay pretty much what you would expect Feels kind of like Freelancer. Not that I played that game a lot. But controlling the game is very simpleIt’s not really hard. There seems to be an auto aim when you bring your reticle close enough to the target. This may not be so much the case in harder difficulties. It’s one of those space combat games which tell where to shoot to hit the enemy. Theres a tutorial which will give you an overview of gameplay. You unlock weapons after each missionThere seems to be some story elements. Something about finding a derelict spacecraft in the first mission. In a bit of a twist. The second mission was actually a race. Which had you attempting to fly through a series of burning circles faster than your opponent. Third mission was an ‘escort’. Half way through there was a weird ill fitting cutscene. After which I found myself in control of a turret. Not sure how I got there.The dialogue is not that bad. First time I heard the scientist dude speak I laughed. One part early on was unintentionally amusing. Your wingman is tragically destroyed. After she flies straight to her death and is obliterated by an explosion. The main character still stops calls out are you okay? are you there or something to that effect. Thing tends to be a bit disjointed. But the voice acting is not always that bad. Theres lots of cheesy jokes which are sometimes actually funny. I found it doesn’t get to the point where it’s annoying.You can select different, ships and loadouts between missions. Menu was kind of weird kept taking me back to the previous menu while I attempted to browse items. Graphics seem good enough. Models weren’t very detailed. Beams from large ships looked kind of lame. Space environment and effects look nice. Asteroids will actually break up into pieces if you shoot them. Character portraits look okay.Sounds okay. Lot’s of nice sci-fi ambient music and decent upbeat music in the menu and cinematics. Pretty much typical sort of shooting sounds and stuff. The menu has some of the same sounds from the original X-Com. Which i thought was cool.My verdictThe game is not completely broken or annoying to play. You might find it fun. I’d it’s worth the price of $4. But maybe you should just get Freelancer instead? Or pay $5 to get into the Arena Commander alpha.The most frustrating thing about this game for me in the end actually was that I couldn't run it in windowed mode. Even after trying to force it with third party programs. So I coudln't record it with FFsplit to do a video review. In fact you can't change the resolution at all.Clickherefor more let’s play videos =)"

This might be the bottom of the barrel of what I've ever played.I'm guessing that they used Freespace or Starlancer as a point of reference while developing this.  The game is mission based dogfighting.The good (there's not much): Visuals are pretty good for a budget game.  More than passable.  I didn't experience any major frame rate drops of anything of that nature.  The music is stock but appropriate.  The story is weak but doesn't hurt anything.Now, the bad. The enemy AI is not good. It will either fly around aimlessly, or swarm you when it has other objectives. The male voice actor is horrendus, and the female voice is terrible text-to-speech.  The controls are worse than both of those.  I tried to play this with the mouse/keyboard controls, using a Thrustmaster T.Flight Hotas, and a Logitech gamepad... none are usable, and they're all flawed in seperate ways. I never even got a chance to properly switch my ship's equipment, since when I could get that feature to function at all, it switched it to something I didn't want and was stuck with since I didn't want to burn another 15 minutes into trying to get it to change again.I got approximately halfway through the game (best I can tell) before getting completely stuck on a turret section.  Even on the lowest difficulty, I get annihilated due to the turret moving independently of my actions.Rating 2/10"

The next block buster Space Combat Shooter? Anyway, here's my, positive, review:Beyond Space is one of those few games that actually suprised me in a very pleasant way. After seeing it on Steam and buying it during a promotion, I booted it up and expected, well, just one of those casual space games.But, oh boy, Beyond Space had me there.First, the art style (Graphics and the way things are presented on the screen) is just warm and nice to the eye. You instantly get the feeling that this game has been designed by people who have their own idea of a Space Combat Game. Which is kind of refreshing.The ship models and basically all the other 3D thingies.., they're very rich and beautiful. This is also one of the few games with ships in the hangar that make me wonder: ""Hmm, which one do I like more? They all look so cool!""The sound and speech in this game are well done and really add to the story. For instance; the music in this game and the intro itself. Oh my, wow, just wonderful to listen to and to watch.The controls are not that many, but respond just the way you would expect. fast and precise. I play this game with a game pad (Not the so much proclaimed X-Box Controller, But a genuine Windows PC Gamepad of a leading brand. X-Box Controllers where never meant to be used with Windows PC's. Do some historical research if you want to learn more about this topic), because I didn't like to play it with the keyboard/mouse and the X-52 Pro is a bit overkill for this game. (That's what I'm thinking anyway)So far the only thing I didn't really understand, or kind of dislike, is the way missions are presented. At this moment, I've flown about 20 missions, all are just presented as a single, stand alone, map/level/mission. There's for some reason not really a feeling of ""connection"" between the seperate missions. As is with the games of ""Eterium""/""Free Space"" for instance. Maybe that's because you never really return to a flight deck or something similar. The mission just ends/fades out.But, beside of that, Beyond Space is a very well made and welcome addition to any would be space fighter jockey.You like Space Combat? You like setting up your ship and load out? Buy ""Beyond Space""; you can't go wrong."
,Not Recommended,297100,14944258,"Posted: 18 March, 2015",all,kschang77,"Beyond Space is a third-person space shooter that has some very good visuals, but not quite enough content, as half the missions doesn't involve the visuals. The trailer promised some huge space battles where you're one fighter among many other fighters among the huge starships pounding at each other. Yet it's seriously underdelivered. The missions seem to be completely disjointed with no progression. One mission you're playing scout for your space navy, then next mission you're a mercenary flying for some unknown benefactor, then next mission you're flying an obstacle course time trial! And yes, it's the same guy ""Max Walker"".  They even threw in a turret defense mission!The writing is almost... high school bad. ""Hal"" was so idiotic it's basically the straight man for any sort of bad joke, taking things too literally. That Irish / Scottish accent is just ARGH! And why is he like in command of the fleet or something? He's basically the primary guy Walker talk to... not only fleet control, but scout report, jump gate control, and more.The game is also notorious for ""giving"" you new weapons, but made it impossible to mount them. The scroll menus for the weapons and components (primary, secondary, shield, and booster) are IMPOSSIBLE to scroll. They require dragging with the mouse, and even then it's nearly impossible. Furthermore, once you did select it, you have to click an additional button to SELECT this weapon or component or else your scrolling were in vain.Once in the cockpit, the visuals are good, but the controls are just... ARGH. None of the ships seem to turn fast enough, and enemy ships seem to be able to turn within its own length. And what's the point of rolling the ship port or starboard? Yet there are two buttons dedicated to that. They don't seem to actually evade anything.Back to the enemy's ridiculous turn rate. You chase down this enemy and you're right behind him, and a few seconds later, the enemy ship had managed to turn 120 degrees and flew past you WITHOUT slowing down. And what's worse, this happens from the smallest light fighters to even corvettes / gunboats that are much larger than fighters. And in this universe, corvettes have afterburners (WTF?!) and can pull away from you, even on full afterburners.The weapons don't feel much different. Primary weapons are infinite ammo, being energy based. Any improvements are minor (like slightly higher firing rate, or trade firing rate for damage, and so on). The ""secondary"" weapons are either heavy guns or missiles, but with limited ammo that has no replenishment within mission... once you're out, you're out, period, and had to rely on guns only.The weapons controls are also weird. With only two buttons, you'd think they'd just do one button for primary and one button for secondary, but no. It's one button to shoot, and one button to switch weapons. That's right, you can't shoot both guns together. ARGH! No ""all guns"" alpha strike!Which brings me to my main complaint: the bosses. There are a couple boss fights in this game, where you need to take down a supership, that's heads and tails better than yours, but may also be escorted. The bosses are usually corvettes of some sort... but they are hardly slow moving. No, they are as fast, if not occasionally faster than you, and they have 360 tracking turrets so deadspots where you can't get hit are almost impossible to find (hint: try the ""bottom"")  They also launch missiles (sometimes) and may be escorted by fighters (sometimes). And you need to kill them by wearing them down... and yes, they can be shielded too.  So what usually happens is they keep lobbing missiles and turret shots at you, while you try to shoot them to wear down their shields so you can bust them with heavy weapons, but due to the bad turning radius of your own ship (and their cheating ships) you end up using all your heavy weapons to no appreciable effect, or got it half dead, then you got chewed to pieces when you try regular strafing runs. The bosses are just TOO HARD, too maneuverable.Sound is not too bad, dialog is professionally recorded, and I'm sure the voice actors did what they could. But it's not a good script. Have to say though, visuals are gorgeous on 1680x1050, and didn't have to much with the resolution much. Just make sure your gamepad is connected and ready BEFORE you start the game, or else the game won't see it. period.All in all, bad bosses, bad humor, missions that really make no sense, and so on, made this game ibarely tolerable, and you should instead pay for the classic Freespace 2 or even Descent: Freespace for about the same price and enjoy that instead."

Controls for keyboard confusing and awkward (W and S are weapons, A and D to dodge, and Arrows to control the direction of the ship).  Was clearly designed to be used on the touch screen of a mobile device (Hanger menu is glitchy to swap between items, there are indicators to the amount and which one you are on, but you can't use that to switch.  You have to click and drag, and that's still glitchy.  And no, the arrows don't do it, I've tried.  The game is more than likely as long as the mobile version.  (Mobile version has 16 levels, and the first one was extremely short, and all I really needed to do was fly around a little bit.  Could barly hit anything, and even when I did, it did very little.)  Another game I wasted money on, and it's more expensive than what it was made for (Price on Steam: $3.99, Price on Apple App Store: $2.99, and I still wouldn't buy that.)  And the game promises a ""BREATHTAKING SPACE ADVENTURE"" (taken staight from their description), and yet the only thing that I would call breath taking is the Star Wars: Episode 3 esque opening cinematic....EDIT: Oh, would you look at that, they even used the Mobile version trailer in the Store page.

The truth is that I love space shooters -- ever since I was a kid.  With the price down to $4.00 and a recent update that fixed the controls (the biggest complaint among many early reviewers), I decided to go for it.Well, it turns out that I was happily surprised by this game.  Foremost, I love the graphics and the space shots of this game.  The initial cutscene was just awesome.  I also enjoyed blowing up the bad ships since it has such cool explosions.  There really is a lot of eye candy in this game.The controls have definitely been fixed and you can mostly use a gamepad (I'm using a wireless Xbox 360 controller).  It still needs some polishing (i.e. the tutorial still requires you have a keyboard even though you're using a gamepad) but I had no crashes and almost everything played well.  One time the maneuverability of my space ship slowed down and I couldn't tell whether it was intentional or a glitch.I found the level of difficulty not too hard or too easy.  I would say it plays more like an arcade game and less of a simulation (I hate complicated space simulations).  Nonetheless, it was definitely enjoyable so far and I didn't find it repetitive.I look forward in playing this game some more and I'm definitely hooked.  Therefore, if you were initially disappointed by the early reviews, I say give this game a shot since you might be pleasantly surprised as I was.Again, it needs some tweaking and polishing, but overall I'm really enjoying the game.  It is definitely worth the price and then some!4 out 5 stars!"

I like the fact that the targeting seemed a bit better than most space shooters I've played. I do find that there is alot more wrong with this game than right tho. The most fustrating issue I had was with the ship customization (if you can call it that) where you swap out weapons and the few addons. All in all the options aren't bad it was the fact that i had to turn my mouse's dpi to its lowest setting to even begin to try and scroll through the weapons menu because for some reason it didn't have a like ""next weapon/item"" you had to swipe it. Even at my lowest dpi moving as slowly as possible I had difficulty changing weapons.I read that using a controller might fix this issue and make it alot easier, well when I finally did get around to trying my controller the game didn't like it at all. It seemed to have more issues with it. The weapon menus still didn't behave and worse my speed + controls refused to work on the controller no matter what I bound it to. Meaning if I hit the speed minus button I'd have to even finish the mission at that speed or worse restart the mission because when I started the level I chose controler not keyboard so its speed + key didn't work either so more than once my ship came to a complete stop forcing me to restart the level.Honestly I could have looked pasted all that was wrong with it because of the space fights and the final boss battle which I really liked if it wasn't just so hard to change the addons to my ship.

Most of the sequences are either very very easy – the AI teammates kill enemies before the player can even interact – or sequences that are nearly impossible like the torrent one in the fourth level.No fun.No gameplay.Dialogs are stupid, idealess and sexist.okay-ish graphics of space.played it two hours.

Controls are very easy it took me like 15 minutes to get use to them( WASD and Directional pad) mouse control was to weird for me to even try to use! The game crashes after every level for some reason and that is the only major con i give this game.

With the sensitivity being so badly borked its no wonder i cant hit the broadside of a barn in this game.Secondly throttle control does not work, which means you will literally get stuck on the second mission, unable to completye it after you go through a stargate.Thirdly, this game takes WAAY too much control away from the player. So much so that i would say its unacceptable.Fourthly, The voice acting is terrible. If you thought the voice acting was bad in other space games then you havent played this one. Its not hilariously bad, more like cringy bad.Fithly there is no throttlew indicator on your hud. In a starfighter game this is a cardinal sin in my opinion.Avoid this sh itty port like you would avoid testicular cancer.  Spend your money on something else.This game gets the inquisitorial seal of Ordo Hereticus and Excommunicatus Traitorum"

So support this game so developers can get more money to make more such games  and improve on future games

Regardless of that however I just can not reccomend it based on the control configurations.  They need a minor rework so that when you invert the cotroller it works for the flight not the pointer, and having the triggers control acceleration and decceleration would be nice instead of the right joystick."

(its a fly and shoot game). Super quick and confuseing at the beginning the game puts you through aseries of challenges in dogfighting in space. Sprinkled with some tame breakers like raceing challenges and some distractions of emplaced turret nature.Bairly meeting its price (I'm being quite generous here..), B.S. (hehe) Does just scrape by, worth my recomendation. The obvious pride of the game is its gfx. But to be honest if i wanted 'beautiful' backgrounds in all my games i would just write them in. The gfx really dont have much to offer past pretty backdrops. The ships action and play are quite common and soon to be put to shame with the next shader generation comming. But truely enhances (or maby even saves) this games playability. There is a cute story that is about a 6th grade level... but most older players wont fall asleep.(now for the ugly truth)In a nutshell No matter what ship you fly or who you are faceing plan on flying circles the entire game. The ai is not very good and spends the entire game doing loops to get behind you to the point the enemy will straight up ram your ship (either on purpose or evading your curser) to emplace positioning to your o.o.v. Which makes this game not very challenging and quite simple. Even after you get chase and they lead you along so thier buddy can pick you off while you go for your target..... guess what? Now there is 3 of you makeing a perfect looking pinwheel in space! WEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!I came into the game expecting a dogfight and i left the game wondering how i would do in the next blue angels tryouts.....But... as i said before.. the price made up for the product. The over all expierence is ok and if your a gamer like me you can find some fun ways to manupliate the ai and bring some challenge to the game.P.s. For full satisfaction, wait till the game is on sale. ;)"

I can't even get through the tutorial because the ship won't fly steady in one direction. The logitech wing man extream joy stick just make the game lock up and you can't get out of some menus as even the mouse pointer jumps all around and just falls off the screen.

Crsahed a couple of times, which was annoying, but it was rare.  Selecting different inventory items really needs fixing its really hard to switch weapons etc.  Just a mouse scroll would help.graphics dated but crisp 5/10, interface 2/10, gamplay average 4/10, duration 3/10 (8 hours), story line weak 3/10, cost low price £3ish so good 7/10.I'd still recommend as a cheap game, but otherwise I'd slate it."

Some are saying it's completely broken, buggy, has bad controller/mouse support... I first tried playingBeyond Spacewith my mouse. Although I didn't like how it felt, there was nothing wrong with how it responded. I turned down the DPI on my mouse which it made it a little more enjoyable. I'm having more fun using an Xbox 360 controller (which also works perfectly), and I have yet to hit a single bug.The voice acting is a little weak and cheesy, and the story so far (about 3 missions in) seems like it could have been written in about 10 minutes, but the gameplay is nice. When I watched the trailer, I suspected this would be similar to something likeStar Foxon the Nintendo 64, and to an extent it is.Star Foxwas pretty linear for the most part, but similar to it's ""All-Range Mode,"" inBeyond Spaceyou fly around freely and complete objectives.While the graphics aren't amazing, by no means are they ""horrible."" The levels appear to be an all-encompasing skybox with certain ""physical"" assets within, such as asteroids and other ships (friendly or otherwise) of varying sizes.As this game was apparently developed for moble devices and ported over to PC, I judged it as such. For what the game is, I am actually having a decent amount of fun with it. It's a nice casual space shooter, and for the $1.99 I paid forBeyond Spaceduring the Steam Christmas sale, I am more than happy with the product I received.TL;DR: Controller and mouse work just fine, and while the story is a bit lacking, the graphics and gameplay are decent. I'd give the game about 3/5. If you likeStar Fox 64or other similar space shooters, this game may be worth a bit of your time."
