Enjoy. :)http://youtu.be/oZORo_I03rMCosmic DJ is game where you create and play using music beats much like on a beat pad app or similar grid sequence music software.This is a game that if you enjoy making music and having a good time then you will love this. But don't think you will be making professional music. This is really to just have fun and enjoy the game experience and the trippy graphics. Also, the game narrator rocks! He is the best part of the game.The game is really about making your own music through beat pade and a grid sequencer using their beats and tunes which they give you a good selection to choose from. But it's up to you how you mix it up. :)But what I really like is that you can save your tunes as an MP3 file on your PC to show off and listen to later on. That's awesome.Overall, for the price, this is a good game experience to try out. :)"

You literally cannot lose.Have you ever dreamed of being a DJ? Playing with all those buttons with labels on them that say ""SAMPLE"" and making awesome music happen, like magic shooting out of your fingers? How about a DJ in space? And also the DJ is on LSD?Sorry, I lost my train of thought. Too busy trying to put this corgi back together with my sweet beats.Just... Just buy it. You will not regret it.

Good VibesS Y N O P S I S:Cosmic DJ is a short romp through a wild story about keeping the good vibes flowing through electronic music. Its gameplay revolves around 'jamming' to a preset back track and layering instruments and melodies to move onto the next stage. Don't expect much flexibility in terms of music creation. All the tracks are set to a specific key signature, measure, and tempo. There is also a limited number of instruments to play with for each track; all of which are set to a specific chord progression. These limitations, however, don't detract from the simple fun of jamming along and freestyling the sequence of melodies and instruments. The story is humorous and engaging enough for players to plow through the short 1 hour plot (give or take a few minutes depending on how much the player extends each jam session). Some players may think this is too short without enough content. I'd say that the length of the game is appropriate for the context of this title. The experience will leave a smile on your face once it's through and you'll wish there was more. Luckily, there is some replayability in a Quickplay mode that lets you choose sets of instruments to jam with and create new tunes. One of the best features of the game is its ability to export your jam sessions to MP3s, complete with cover art that you make within the game itself, using the various crazy visuals and stickers they provide. All in all, this is a great indie title for anyone who enjoys rhythm games and quirky, offbeat humor with pop art visuals. Give it a shot!"

By simply pressing four keys at different intervals, you can generate simple 2-measure sequences of electronic music in 4/4.  It sounds basic, but with its variety of different instruments (drum kits, synthesizers, vocoders, odd samples, and many others), grid-based editing, and post-play remixes, anyone can make a song that can range anywhere between decent to amazing.The presentation style is absurd and comical.  The vivid colors, animations, and effects can probably be described better by video gameplay rather than this review.  I found the dialogue to be humorous, but could be considered strange or obnoxious.I wouldn't recommend this to a general audience, but it does have a very strong recommendation to anyone who likes electronic music, unique atmospheres, or just something completely different."
,Recommended,297110,10160352,"Posted: 18 May, 2014",all,Gyrocop,"First of all, if anyone is afraid of the ""Early Acess"" mark, then don't fret, because the game is basically finished, and I have not experienced any bugs or the like.So what in the rationality of the cosmos is this?This is basically a simplified version of a music program turned into a semi-game. It's not really a game, but it's not really a creative software. This might sound bad on paper, but the execution is done surprisingly well.So what do we do in this game?You enter a level and you get 5-6 different instruments which you can use to make some qoute-unqoute ""Sweet Jams"". Each instruments have four notes or sounds (depending if it is a melodic instrument or percussions or something). Here you can either choose to put it in a grid or you can map them to the computer keyboard to play the instruments live. You have 8 tacts that loop to fill out, each split into 4 different quarter tacts, totalling a total of 32 places to place the sound. So with 5 instruments, 4 notes, and 32 places to play, you can make a total of 640 different versions per song... kinda. The song you make is in actuality just a part of the song, and you need to make 4 parts of the song in total, making the total of different versions totalling 2560.After making a song, the game will mix it and make a minute and twenty seconds long single out of it, and you will get the option to make an album cover of said single.How many songs are there?5,5-ish. I know that's a silly answer, but it will make sense when you play.Is it fun?YES! Yes, it is, although I can't shake the feeling that there really is no way to make a bad song, unless you're actually trying to. You don't actually make the song totally from scratch. There is always some background music, which is basically the same for every song, as it turns out, and then you map out the five instruments and they kind of drown out in each other a bit, so it's actually hard to hear if what you've made is a substantial piece.But honestly, that doesn't matter. You're really not supposed to feel good about the songs afterwards, this is a game, where you will be having a blast WHILE MAKING the song. Yeah, afterwards the song may not be that good in hinsight, but goddamnit you were grooving the hell out when mixing it.Also the option to either use the grid sequenser or the tabs is a good choice. The more somber perfectionistic type will probably be loving the grid, while the more bombastic person, who may or may not play live instruments, will probably like to groove out with the tabs.It also helps that the more instruments and the more music you put into your jams, the wilder the background music gets.As a game, there is no real way of losing, and it is not really challenging at all, but the game is not about that.Uhmm... this is probably a stupid question, but is there a story?Surprisingly, yes. You are the Cosmic DJ, and you send groovy jams and good vibes throughout all of the galaxies, but the annoying STEVE4 is sending bad vibes, and you must stop him. It is an incredibly non-sensical story, filled with humor and it doesn't warrant to be taken seriously.Is the price fair?Hmm... yeah, I think so. The main game is only an hour and half long, but there is a lot of replay value picking the ""Quickplay"" menu, and then just make a neat little groove every now and then. 6€ (or whatever it is in dollars or pounds) is not much and you will have fun with the game every now and then.This game is approved."

As I got further into the game, this gave way to more diverse sets of instruments, and you develop the skills to layer music in an enjoyable, more strategic way.  Either way, the game is very entertaining and humorous.  Though levels vary in quality, the game is a great experience if you can get in the zone and make something great - which is helped along by the background music that prompts you with cues.  A terrific introduction to sequencers.The ability to export your songs and give them cool album art is terrific icing on the cake: a permanent way to remember what you did.  Putting a timer on album art creation was also a good way to keep things spontaneous."

,Recommended,297110,22849296,"Posted: 7 May, 2016",all,Mr.WereWolph,"Here is a list of Pros and Cons of the game.ConsStory line takes less than an hour...This means after you complete the storyline, that's it, everything else you do from then on is not story driven, it's pretty much a studio from that point on. The developers could have stretched out the levels, and made more. But unfortunately there are only 5 levels, including the ""boss battle"". The reason I list this is because there was so much potential in creating bonds between the player and the characters, but just as soon as it happens, the game is over. Also, if you paid for a game that's 3 dollars, wouldn't you want a bit longer experience? That's 5 cents for every minute you play of the storyline.Instrument quality...Some of the instruments sound really wierd and choppy, while others are pretty good, this is a bit bad because free play, from what I have seen (don't quote me on this but I didn't see the feature), is that you cannot choose what instruments to use, they are always randomized, could it inspire interesting sounds and songs? Yeah, but you should def have more control over what you get to use in freeplay.Failure to explain some mechanicsNow this one is questionable, because the main mechanic is making music, and filling the jam meter. But every once in a while, after I finish inserting the notes for a instrument, an explosive like tile floats across the screen to the right, and apparently if you click on it, it explodes or something, idk because the game didn't really tell me.Flashing LightsI noticed that some of the lights in this game were actually a bit intense, not that I am epileptic, but if you are, you may want to consider not playing and I would stamp a warning on this game somewhere if it truely can trigger an epileptic seizure. I guess this one is debatable.Alright, now for the ProsProsEngaging and interesting visuals...You like space? You like dogs? You like interactive backgrounds while you play? I sure do, and I did playing this game.Good music...This is questionable, obviously, as you are the one making the music, but if you know at least a little bit of what you are doing, then the beats will get pretty epic.Exporting your music...Yes, you can actually export your music, I plan on uploading mine to soundcloud because my mixtape is pretty fire, not gonna lie. But yeah, you can get a mp3 file of the song you just made, pretty cool.Innocent and charming atmosphere...Many a times I found myself laughing at how cute and charming the characters were, I guess you could say that they charmed me ''WITH THE POWER OF MUSIC!!!!'But if you really like this game, buy it when it's for sale, so put it in your wishlist, and wait for the next sale, I got it for $0.74, which I feel was worth every penny. Honestly you could buy it for $3 and still feel content."

The story is kooky,but irrelevant.  The game is about building and creating your own music. Thereisn't a score system, and no real failure state; instead the game is about layingdown a ""sick"" beat and melody.  You are limited to what tones are provided to you,which limits  the player from creating something truly unique to the player.  Itmissed the mark a bit there, because the mechanics to provide this are there, theyjust don't allow more freedom to the player.One fun feature is the availability to use the music any way you want, withno copyright issues, you can download it onto your computer to listen to at yourleisure.  For the price point, this game is easy to recommend.

Personally I just find it far too limiting and repetitive. You press a block, it plays a note - you press more blocks, it plays more notes. Again, for the price, extremely worth it.

Although 4 isn't much in retrospect, it didn't seem like I had fewer options, rather it seemed like the whole thing was simpler. There's also the added bonus of re-playing the same level many times and making completely different beats each time through. There are several songs you must apply beats to, and at the end of every level it combines all the songs into one *cosmic jam* for you to listen to!

My only real issue about this game is that it's short- it's VERY short. It only took me 1 hour to finish the story line- which wasn't really much of one. Cosmic DJ is a game where you are a Cosmic DJ and have to save the city from ""Bad Vibes"" from the main antagonist (forgot his name). The antagonist destroys all the ""Jamtennas"" that provide good vibes to the city. As the cosmic DJ, you must fix these ""Jamtennas"" by completing the tasks given. There are 4 Jamtennas you must fix and each Jamtenna offers 4-5 missions where you need to create a song using the tools given and fix the Jamtenna. The gameplay is very fun and energetic. It's not really complicated and can easily be done by a child. One thing I really liked about the game is that after you create your song, the game will mix all of the songs from that one Jamtenna into a remix which you can save as a .mp3 to your computer. You can create cover art while the game converts the remix into a .mp3. You aren't forced to save the songs, if you really don't like it.Conclusion: If you are hesitant on getting this game, buy it. It's cheap, fun, and will kill time if you need to. 9/10"

Normally I wouldn't buy a game like this, or really indie games this was just something to spend the remainder of my money on. Also, because my brother had a music sequencer app on his phone, and that influenced me to get this as well.At first I wasn't that intersted in it. Now that I've put some time into it, and understand how to create music a bit better it's more fun. It's actually really easy to create a song. I call it song, but really it's just a loop. I haven't played too much of the main story just one jamtenna. That was when I first got it. Since then I've been messing with quickplay.It reminds you a lot of Katamari Damaci. Seems very Katamari Damaci inspired.I can't really convince you to buy it. I mean it seems like you would either be interested in it, or not. Music maker games were always a niche.The only things I wish this game had were......-Ability to choose own instruments in quickplay (which isn't that much of a bother really. maybe cosmic dj 2? :D)-Ability to save the loop unremixed. Most of my loops sound better remixed anyways, but still... Maybe you just want the loop?-Ability to tap along to your song while it's playing and the instrument not laying down on the track. Like when I'm choosing my instruments I can play with them, and tap out a beat with that specific instrument. If I do it while I am creating a song it lays down on the track, and I can't expirement with those instruments without it repeating!Creating song's is addicting though."

It is easy to go in and create a beat of your own with and you do not need to be a wiz with music making to do it well.  However this is where the negatives start to kick in.  In the game you go between 4-5 different instruments and create beats with essentially 4 different notes....and that's it really. There are bonus loops or instruments that can appear and give you the option of changing your current instrument with the new one or have the option of selecting new music in general.  Besides this there is no other way to make or alter music.  This is where the simplicity will be seen as a negative.  You are not able to fade music in or out, change the BPM, and there is no way to edit your samples the way YOU want after you create them.  The game will automatically edit the samples together which may make your song sound better or worse.  It is a shame that if you want to make advanced samples or create your own songs your out of luck really.  It took me 3 hours to go through the entire ""story"" section but I will say I had a lot of fun playing through it.  Even though you have limits to the kind of music you can make it is still a fun expereince that is worth that little bit of money it costs to play it.  People looking for an advanced music maker to make samples and great tracks would probably get nothing from this, but for players looking for a simple and fun music creation game to mess around and have fun with then there is nothing wrong with this game.  Did I forget to mention any song you finish you can save and export it to your music library on you computer to listen to whenever you want (even if the songs are just 1 minute long).  A lot of neat ideas in this game I just wish there would be options for more advanced options to give people freedom to create even more awesome tracks.    However because the game only costs a couple of dollars my negatives really are just minor.        Cosmic DJ get's a 7/10 From me.  ""It's good for what it provides you for a few dollars and gives you a fun time while providing cool and silly visuals that will put a smile on your face.""+Fun samples and good beat+Great Price+Easy to pick up and play+Able to Export your music converted automatically to MP3 to your computer library+/- Length of game is short but is reasonable considering price-Simplistic and does not offer any advanced means to create some real creative samples and tracks-some samples that you HAVE to use don't feel like they fit in the song your making-no way to select what instrument for when you create custom tracks"

,Recommended,297110,16838907,"Posted: 1 July, 2015",all,Peaezy,"Disclaimer:I bought this game for $0.79 during a sale. My review is based on paying this price. If you look to pay significantly more or less for this game, my view point doesn't apply to you as much.Summary:Cosmic DJ is a music game that require zero musical experience. The player gets to ""create"" music using one very simple tool. To spice things up some, there is a bit of a story driven single player mode that doesn't take itself seriously at all. It managed to get some laughs out of me, but it's silly humor probably isn't for everyone. The game only took me a couple of hours to beat. Apart from the story missions, you can just freely use the music creation tool and everything you do in the game can be exported to MP3s if yuou just have to share with your friends.The Good:Cosmic DJ does an amazing job of setting a mood and sticking with it. I quickly learned that the game wanted me to laugh and have fun the whole time and it succeeded in doing such. Knowing absolutely nothing about music will not stop you from enjoying this game. Soundtrack was pretty damn good :DThe Not so Good:While you can switch the creation tool into ""grid mode"" there is very little customization happening. For people who are familiar with music, you get to edit rythym down to sixteenth notes, but the actual notes are locked into 4 tones for every song. I understand that this is to make it easy for everyone, but I felt like I was missing out on some really cool stuff because of how limited I was. It seems like just a little bit of work could really turn that around.The Verdict: 7/10 -3 for lack of depth. I felt like Cosmic DJ could have really impressed me and drawn me in for a few more hours but missed the mark. But, for $0.79, it's hard to go wrong with Cosmic DJ."

Overall there are about 6 'Areas' to play through and each one has 4 miniature 'stages' where you can play around with 5 different instruments/voxes. The backing tracks can only be changed a tiny bit through progression, the more stuff you put into a song the more options you might get to add into it even further.The story's funny to me personally, I rather liked the 'far out' voice of the narrator and the weird things that happen along the way. There's a charm to how simple this game is and honestly I couldn't stop playing once I picked it up.The soundtrack is awesome, especially since the player has quite a bit of influence over it, and there's even more charm to be found in a game that lets you export your little creations to a folder on your computer for later listenings (it's automatic, so don't expect a deep, in-depth music creator here).Even though the game is incredibly short (expect 2-4 hours depending on how much you want to screw around with the tracks) I found that it was definitely worth the price of admission.

You don't get to edit your own sounds, but you do get to manipulate the ones they provide. An added plus is that you get to kind of save some part of the universe with your bass.Nothing wrong with that, IMO."

It's fun to play even if you know nothing about music and I think it's appropriate for all ages. Even after you finish the game, you can still create more songs, so it's pretty re-playable. I definitely recommend this game if you want to play something fun, short, and sweet."
