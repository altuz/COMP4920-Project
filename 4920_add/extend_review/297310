So if you want music, be prepared to launch the Steam music player. LOL.If you buy this game now, the only benefit you will get is being a part of the development process and helping give the devs input on what they can add and do to improve the game.I honestly think this game won't be finished for at least another year or so. But at least the devs got the foundation done.They are at least honest enough to admit that what the game offers now is extremely limited, in it's beginning stages and nowhere near done.Let's just hope the devs come through and don't pull an incident like the devs of The Stomping Land... smh, everytime I think of that game.But if the devs for Pro Wrestling X pull through, we are in for a bada$$ wrestling game to look forward to in the future. :DRemember buying this game now is at your own risk.Good luck to the devs making this game."

You click play, it drops you in the ring, you can do a suplex, punch, or pin. That's it. That's the entire game. You can't lose, the enemy can't pin, and it doesn't even count to 3. There's just a random coin toss when you pin someone that if you win or he kicks out.I get that it's early access, but this is a concept stage at best. This is the sort of thing one guy could do in a few days and it's costing you $9.99 on steam.Stay away and wait for it to come out. (if that ever happens)"

I remember following this over 10 years ago and was so excited to hear about a game based around the N64 THQ games. But, unfortunatley this game falls extremely flat.It plays like it should be in pre-alpha and instead of focusing on the core game play, which is not good at all, the devs keep adding more stuff that really doesn't do anything for the game.I keep reinstalling this game every so often to see if it plays any better and it never does.Sorry, Dave. But you've tried and failed horribly."
,Not Recommended,297310,15133841,"Posted: 30 March, 2015",all,Plaguedog519,"EDIT: So I will update this since apparently since some guy sucking up to the developers is going around posting ""oh this is outdated! This game is actually updated now!!!"" on every single outdated review, and the dev is bragging about updating now.This game has changed a little since November.  There are a few new moves, a momentum meter, and basic AI logic.  Those are your ""many updates"" you're parading around and bragging about.  That's what's been added in the last 9 months. There have been excuses as to why development has been slow and I understand that things happen, but we're talking about the decision as to making a purchase here.  This game is $10.  It's been clear that people aren't necessarily purchasing a game, but a promise.  A small handful of updates recently does not absolve the huge gap of nothing but excuses.  $10 is purchasing a promise that is not guaranteed to come true and it is a HUGE risk to buy in on this promise that has a long history of disappointment and very little to show for it.I'm also sick of hearing this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t of ""We've been updating sometimes twice per day lately"" because I distinctly remember hearing something along the lines of 'we're updating more than most early access titles"" back in November.  That is just offensive. People bought in because of that statement thinking this was going somewhere and all we got were excuses.  You go and make this new statement and more people see some minor updates, buy in, and then what?  9 more months of excuses.  This game does not update frequently.  ARK: Survival Evolved updates frequently.  Getting to this minor milestone of being able to have a 1/2 star match after 9 months is not a worthwhile investment that should be recommended to potential buyers.  I'm sorry but it's not.There's not even a manageable UI at this stage.  Discovering the controls is pure guesswork.  That should have been a priority above anything else. You added more moves without telling people how to actually DO them!Look, I get it, this is a small developer trying to make a big game, but Early Access is Early Access.  It has the good side and the bad side.  The good side are your games like ARK, that are updated daily, released in a playable semi-polished state that improves steadily.  Pro Wrestling X is the bad side of Early Access.  It's the game that goes on hiatus immediately after it becomes available for purchase, doesn't update for months, and after 9 months of development, has very little to show for it. I know ARK has a big team and all and PWX has like 2 and a half people, but it doesn't change the fact that they both have the same title of Early Access and one is worth the investment while the other isn't yet.I stand by my original review.  This game DOES have potential, but the promise of a game is just too risky to invest in at this point.  Bragging about updates and having pathetic white knights downvote and comment on outdated reviews does nothing to make this product worth purchasing.  It's only trying to hide and mask the current state of this game that's not worth investing in (in my opinion) so that more people will buy the game (because ""oh hey the bad reviews are downvoted, they must be wrong! Also, Updaetz!"")I will update the review when my opinion changes, and if that happens, it will bring me great joy.  I want this game to succeed but as of right now I do not recommend this game, and going around downvoting and posting on 5-month-old reviews does nothing to make me feel better about the product that I invested in as soon as it came on Steam.Original Review Below from March 30, 2015:Very basic and shows promise, but since the game was put on steam there have been *EDIT* A Few *END EDIT* updates and a whole bunch of empty promises.  Hopefully it gets better with time, but right now, I would recommend to stay away and just follow the game until it gets to something resembling the developers' vision.  It's not worth playing in its current state and it DEFINITELY isn't worth $9,99"

I'm no developer but I have a hard time understinding why updates take so long to be released especailly when I see other indie games that get constant updates. It's very frustrating see the little progress this game has made since I bought it. In it's current state it is not worth playing. I could accept updates once a month but this is ridiculous.

Someday, in several more years it may be worth $10.  It is not worth that now.Every year or so I boot it up and see what they've added, and while they have come a long way --- the game still plays horribly.It aims to capture the magic of the AKI games (No Mercy, WCW/NWO Revenge, etc.) of the past, but it isn't anywhere near it yet.  It plays so sluggish that it only resembles these games in screenshots.  Actual gameplay is painful and unresponsive.Verdict:  don't buy."

76561198115179421,Not Recommended,297310,29365526,Posted: 19 January,all,Fizzel,"CURRENT REVIEWAs the developer said they did put a lot of work in. The game plays much smoother now. Normally arounf 20-30 fps. They added some characters, but for the most part it is more of the same. They added cage matches, 4v4s, more arenas, and some other features. The graphics are nice enough. I do like the songs they have for the game. It plays like old school wrestling games and doing moves can be very satisfying. It is serviceable, but I can only recommend if you enjoy the old school style of wrestling games (well no duh, that is the style the developers intended) and you have a person to play against. Otherwise all there really is to do is 1v1 exhibitions against the computer. The AI isn't really challenging even on the hardest difficulty. Customization is weak, as you can't make your own wrestlers. There isn't a career mode, and lack of options will cause the game to fall flat. You can only edit the premade ones, and there are limited options. You can pick a item and recolor it. The game is pretty fun, and handles nicely now. Keeping all this in mind, if you enjoy this style and have someone in your home to play it with, it could be worth the purchase. The developers are good guys who put a lot of work in, but it still feels like there isn't much content for the 10$. Hopefully they can add a career mode, or a basic arcade playthrough for a champion ship belt. A in game moves list or practice mode would be cool as well. A big plus would be actually being able to name and add in your wrestler.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I paid for the potential. It's there, but it's clunky. They posted a update, so it runs much better. . It needs a lot of work. Characters all look the same. Grappling isn't as responsive as it could be. The brief bits of music I heard, I liked. The graphics are decent, but need cleaning up. I think calling the game version .99 is being generous. It needs a lot more work to feel finished. I can't recommend it at this time. It's fun enough, but the grappling can be clunky, and it feels like there isn't much content here. Character customization is almost non-existant (around 2 options for most things, and then color). There are features that are in the options, but not selectable. There is a decent variety of moves. It takes a bit to figure out which buttons to use, and there are no button options in game. Pick it up while on sale if anything."

Regardless of the version number, this game has a long way to go before being a release for mass consumption.  It is an incredibly limited experience right now in regards to match types, attack/grapple variety, appearance, and small touches such as the fixed camera angle, the inability to leap over a downed opponent while walking/running, etc.  From all appearances the game is far better than the initial steam release, and the team does care about feedback from those who purchase.

The developers released it early access to allow die hard fans of the N64 era of wrestling an opportunity to voice their input. The only positive thing I can say at this point is that the character models look fantastic.

I have desired to support the project monitarily since around 2005 but I just haven't been able to muster the extra funds.

I respect the perseverance and heart of this project.I am giving this game a thumbs up, not because I enjoyed playing the current build, but because I was finally able to physically interact with a project that for over a decade has been only screen shots and commentary. I do have some criticisms of the build but I will find a different outlet for those as I am a hardcore wrestling game fan and I suspect the average gamer might not understand my reasons.It is encouraging to see the makings of a creation suite at this early stage. The addition of the ability to take snapshots with a free camera, adjust and customize rings, and create a wrestler will allow us to see these features grow along with the core mechanics of the game and that excites me.So, I'll save my criticisms for a different time and place.

I've waited to see a little more content before taking the plunge and buying it but thought 'what the hell' maybe putting a little capital into it may just get it moving quicker. I have always been a wrestling fan and definitely a wrestling gamer fan but have a huge love for Three games in particular, WCW World Tour on the PS1, Fire Pro Wrestling 2 on the Gameboy Advance and WWF No Mercy on the N64 so a game that even vaguely resembles any of these would be ideal… So this is what I have found so far and what I'd like to see coming soon just to add a bit more longevity.Firstly, this game is super smooth, it plays like a dream even on highest graphical settings, wrestlers movements are really smooth and even though at this stage the moves are limited they all look nice, I’ve certainly not had any of the Smackdown of old issues with collisions problems with dropkicks. The rope running is nice and again I have had no issues from the few games I have played thus far. All and all it looks and feels good thus far.The game itself is very, very early stages and it shows in the other aspects of the game, lack of moves, only 3 characters and nothing really to do in create a wrestler bar mix and match the costumes from the two named workers… All of this is already noted in the previous reviews and the description so I wasn’t shocked at all by this, I was however disappointed there was no generic tights, trunks and masks of just plain colours so even in its raw form you could at least cobble together a motley roster just if nothing else to stave off the repetitive nature of the game at its current stage.All in all, I would say it needs a few more little things adding before it is worth the amount it is up for however if you wanna support the game and see it grow into something remarkable then click buy even if you don’t intend to play it for a few updates because it really does show so much potential even with the small amount already there.So in short for me to make it worth it as is it needs:•	A few generic Create a player bits just to give you something to get your teeth into•	One more character at least•	A single weapon like a chair to see an example of weapon collision detection.All in all, though If you wanna support an independent wrestling game with promise click buy."

The camera isn't quite right but some seven months after they started you can now simulate a very basic fight versus an AI wrestler.

I may very well have to change my opinion!***Update 9/5/16***Updates up to this point are pretty awesome.

Who performs that song?!All in all, to be honest, this game still needs a lot of work before it is a contender, but the content has potential. Some kind of progressive mode and a CAW would be the minimum before final release."

WE help shape the future of this game by providing feedback for the developers. It's not in a finished state and it should not be treated as if it is a finished product.If you're a fan of the old school wrestling games from the Nintendo 64 era, Pro Wrestling X just might be up your alley! In early access the game is limited to three game modes, basic wrestler editor and a ring editor. There are three playable characters with the option to create up to nine of your own. Move sets are limited but will be expanding with each update. The progress that has been made on this game so far is impressive when you keep in mind the size of the development team.Pro Wrestling X is a game that has so much potential. Although the game is limited in its current state and needs a bit more polish, the future for Pro Wrestling X is looking bright. If you're looking to support a game that looks to bring a modernized wrestling experience inspired by the N64 games, look no further then Pro Wrestling X!"
,Recommended,297310,13143969,"Posted: 29 November, 2014",all,HiFlyinLowlife,"TL:DR translation - Coming along. (Original Review Below for reference)When I first played this and declined to give it an overall recommendation for purchasing it, it was, in fact, extremely early in development as far as steam goes. Anything and everything the community said about the developer, honestly, loomed in the back of my mind like a heel turn at a PPV when you know good and well the star heel of the federation is taking a break being hurt (aka - Shooting a movie) and someone has to pick up the torch.After loading it up, however, I was greeted to a new menu. Progress. I liked it. I played around with the edit button and this part of the area. It is easy to see the foundation work in place, but the developer is wisely persuing gameplay advances. So let me get to that.A quick selection started the up and coming Default... yeah.. I forgot to rename him before I saved... against Grasshopper. After seeing each character given a serviceable in ring introduction, the contest was started. Default was determined... he walked up to Grasshopper and punched.Grasshopper blocked it?What... when... okay.. This is new.. So I backed up to collect my thoughts coincidentally right as Grasshopper attempted a drop kick. Thankfully I was back far enough. A few grapple moves instead and some playing around with button combinations... as if I expected to shoot a fireball out of my hands.. And bam. Default had his first win, but it wasn't just his.Fans of the old schoo N64 wrestling games where it was all about fun have won, too. Pro Wrestling X is alive and definately on track.Don't get me wrong. This is STILL early access. And the developer clearly keeps that thought forefront in all his materials. It is just now, there is a lot of improvement and the game has earned a definite thumbs up from me. If you want finished product, have fun with big fed game. Just don't be shocked if this old school Gym and folding chair independent game gives them all they want and more.At this point, that's very much in the hands of the developer.ORIGINAL REVIEWYes, I'm in on it and a believer. At the current price, most of you would be very much off put to purchase this at this time. My recommendation to you all is to follow this project and watch implementations as they arrive. At this point in time, the developer is VERY CLEAR that there isn't much to do here. Punch, Grapple, slam and pin. That's all you get. Once they are in place and at a point you wish to jump in, do so. ' Nuff said. So, for most of you, honestly at this point it is a no.This, however, is very deceptive of my personal feelings about where this can go and the opportunity for those of you that want a No Mercy style game on the PC. Hop on, buckle up and take notes. The opportunity is here to get involved with the development (as much as the developers would listen, that is)So, that in mind, here is my wish list. (NOTE: WISH LIST MEANS NOT IN GAME)-More... (Directly from Captain Obvious here.. More moves, More Wrestlers, More Environments.. I think the cheesy crowd thing can be averted.. It will only be a point of nit picking down the line unless it is done shaded or almost greyed out.)-MP3(/video?) integration. Ever look through the song list and think... damn.. I want my wrestler to come out to this one song but it isn't here... Well.. it will be your own library that you pick from. The developer isn't supplying it.. so it isn't his concern about copyright infringements.. just yours if you share the match on youtube.-Commentary (very touchy situation here.. good luck, devs) Watch a match with the sound off.. any match on TV.. isn't as exciting is it? Well. The game in current state won't seem as exciting without the commentators giving you the vocal thumbs up or down.-Running. Could also be used as a modifier... Run + strike = lariat Run + Rope + Strike = Rebound crossbody eh.. throw it under more.That all being said, it is an excellent start.I'm gonna shut my pie hole now as the devs are probably shaking their heads saying (already on most of this)"

I bought this game for its potential, not for its current state; I was fully aware that the 'Early Access' label applies to Pro Wrestling X in the truest sense of nearly any Early Access game I've ever played (and I've played a few).As a long time wrestling fan (I've been watching since the late 70s), I hope the devs keep plugging away on this game, and give us precisely what was promised.Currently, there aren't a whole lot of options, and playability is questionable (perhaps this will change when some of these huge updates are applied to the Steam Branch) at best.While not impressed with the current state of the game, I'm excited at the promise that Pro Wrestling X holds, and I look forward to eventually being able to really dig into this game.I'll recommend the game to true wrestling fans, but if you want to play right now, pass on it until more features are added and a lot more polish is applied."

So basic it plays like those old fighter demos from back in the day where you could only choose from one of the two characters and play on one stage. However right now as of it's most current build you can edit a third wrestler and make him your own with a very basic editing system that they currently put into the game. Also the game handles nicely on a Nvidia GT610 card with 4GB of memory in ""1280x720 full screen resolution"" with ""fantastic graphics mode"" chosen. Anyways if you liked the N64 No Mercy style of game play this is what they are working towards and I don't think you'll be disappointed.

,Recommended,297310,31327516,Posted: 23 April,all,Buck Fanana,"I bought this game because I wanted to support the idea of a broader variety of wrestling games on the market.  I'm not a No Mercy loyalist as this game's description shamelessly panders to, but I did play the game a lot when I was younger.The HUD is just like No Mercy, the gameplay is similar to it.  The game looks pretty great in still motion.  This game is obviously incredibly early access and isn't going to be something you're playing 24/7.  It has a handful of modes and characters, a character editor, and supports 360 controllers as advertised.I'm excited to watch the game grow, and I'd say for $10 if this product continues to evolve it will eventually be well worth that price tag.  Right now,  I think you're more investing in an idea than a product.I hope as this game continues on, the animations get more fluid, the entrances less rail looking, and the characters a bit more diverse.  I've seen previews of what the dev posts through their social media and I know the game will head in this direction, but in it's current state it is still a product with a brighter future than it currently is at.I would recommend buying this game now, if only to help the developer as they continue to fine tune and improve this game.  No Mercy was great in 1999, but I also hope you keep in mind there are some things about it that weren't perfect and that game could still use some improvements over what it was."

First time a Wrestling Game is on the PC, and I'm already impressed,heck, excited!For Starters:The Main Menu greets me with a bad @$$ Rock Song, and a small, albeit userfriendly Options and Keyboard / Controller Ready Interface, myLogitech PC Controller already feels at home in Pro Wrestling X(w/out the need for JoytoKey?? Color me impressed!) Whoever made thisgame Controller friendly; great job!The Menu is all here: Single Play, Options, Edit, Credits, etc.Each Menu item is simple, and covers the Basics, like a goodFighting / Wrestling Game should, and I got everything in my Options tweaked and Saved in a jiffy.However, I would like to see Mouse Support; a PC Wrestler Game w a Mouseis the stuff of dreams. Maybe even Touch Screen Interface on future PC Platforms....The Edit Mode already shows promise:  I made a Ring and a Fighter, withthe help of the present interface, very user friendly, and with a healthylist of Edit Options. It reminded me of older Wrestler Games fromye Old School; simple, but fun to make.The CAW mode is a huge seller for me, in any Wrestler, and this one doesit nicely. The textures and details really look convincing. The Lucha Libre styled Mask and matching pads are a very classy touch, the one that caught my eye invoked an almost Draconic feel. I dig it.Of course, I wouldn't a Female Wrestler Option. A Sable and/or Chyna -esquewrestling hottie in HD, with the return to ""the N64 / No Mercy Era""??Doing a Bronco Buster in the Corner??  mmmm giggidy!!And an Editable Moves List. (Sorry, had to say it!)Anyway. I can't wait to see how the Edit Mode Evolves!Gameplay Wise: It's got the basic nuts and bolts down; the Moves work likethey should: the Strikes hit accurately, The Grabs do do their job, theGuard works, like No Mercy... etc.The AI Edit is a welcome feature, and the AI Bot works well enough.  Istarted withInactive, to get the Game Play down pat, then bump it up as we got thingsunder way.Between the DDT and Tower Suplex, that alone made me grin.And that Dragon Sleeper has never looked cooler. (One of my old stand byes.now we just need a Dragon Suplex!!)Speaking of which, I'm hoping to see some Back Grapples. Seeing aDragon Suplex, or Tossing German Suplex or a Rough Toss, in this this games edgy appearance, would be a treat.I noticed the ""Left Bumper"" (left, front Shoulder Button, or""L1"" in PlayStation speak)does a Back Step, with the hands raised. I wonder; Reversals?(I sure hope so!)The Run... done with the Y Button on my Controller, well... it's archaic.Hate to say it. In current Wrestling Games, you have a ""Free Run"", hold a Shoulder Button, and Run Freely.Try that, see if it works.So far, in Game Play, the game runs pretty smooth. The pacing is a littlesluggish, I would like to see more variation in individual Fighter Speeds;how fast / slow they move, how fast they get up, etc. Personally, I wouldn't mind a feature were your Fighter quickly clambers to his / her feet, or Kips Up, or even an Ukemi: a quick Roll off the Ground, when you are knocked down.  Things like this make a game flow quickly and smoothly.I notice, when I interact with my opponent; several opportunities to attackin unique ways:while the AI was in several different and prone positions; such as bent over,sitting up, getting up etc, I'm thinking: different Holds, Grapples, Strikes,etc; in all the enemies varying postures.  More ways to mess with theopposition in his/hers many vulnerable states, would really spice theMoves List Up.Also, ways to Break and Cancel your own Holds / Grabs, and possibly flowinto another move, or simply Release the Opponent, to set up a ""big surprise"",would be neat.Other then that; between the Basics: Strikes, Grabs, Lifting the Opponent offthe Mat, and getting yourself up, fairly quick... it's all there.I hope we can exit the ring soon. The Outside Ring Count Down, before a DQ, should be Optional.Also, gotta have Back Stage Areas. Like No Mercy. I miss those.On a Side Note: 1. The In Match Song. KEEP THAT. It's a kick @$$ song.In Match Music is good Music, PLEASE, NO BORING COMMENTARY.2.  A variety of Music and Songs, would be awesome.Personally, I'm thinking: 8 and 16 Bit Era Music, Rock and Metal, or Technoand Rave.On that note, if you do decide on Commentary in Ring:A. Keep it witty. Like SVR 2006 witty. It made laugh at times.B. Use your In House Voice talent, from your Development Team, to runCommentary:make Fictional Characters of yourselves, you inject yourself into your ownwork this way, (and save money on Actors lol) you get to goof off inDevelopment, and when your Testerslisten to In Match Commentary; you can say: ""Yup, that's me!""Dave Wishnowski; In Game Host, Narrator, Announcer, etc... heck, screenyourself, and  your Team,  in the Announcer Chairs, Audience, Back StackInterviews...! OWN IT, DUDE.. That would we cool.C. Make Commentary, In Match Music / Songs, heck, even running Dev. Teamtalks, Options, that can Toggled In the Options Menu, under Music Options.This way, we have the Option of hearing Songs, Music, Narrative, Ect,in the Games Matches.I can picture:  Directors Cut Commentary, on the evolution of Pro Wrestling X,in a Match.Or random goofing off on the mic. Just a thought.But keep it all Optional. Different strokes, right?This way, your more involved in the game's progress.My Favorite thing, thus far, is the way the game itself looks:  The Ring Itself.In a Shadowy Darkness. No Crowd. No Ref. No Announcer. The soft focus glow,complimented by the colors, highlights, the lighting and shadows.... duuuuude,keep that. Or at least, make it an Option. I already dig the aesthetics of the""Current Look"". I hope that look sticks around, very dramatic... like aPlay Wright, or an Opera Scene.  If you use a crowd, make them look Shadowy,like a dramatic play.An Idea:  make a scene like a Japanese Dojo, keep the lighting low, lit bycandles, and have the Crowd on Traditional Mats, like an Asian Teahouse,with their faces barely showing in the candle light and shadows.Another Idea:  A nod to the Undertaker, and his Acolytes, keep the Ring dark, &lit with Torches.Ideas like this, make a game memorable.  (Remember WCW Thunder, PS1? It hadcrazy Stages!)But so far, the Game Play is off to good start, man!! Keep it upOverall, I'm excited. I can't wait to see where Pro Wrestling X goes, and seewhere the Crazy Train ends up next!!The 2nd Coming of No Mercy is upon us. I can feel it.But remember:  Just like a Dragon's Claw never stops growing, never stopimproving. Do not be satisfied with limits; Evolve, Grow, Adapt. The Journeyto true Greatness, never ends.

Now it seems a near beta game, but I feel like I would become old before it will be completely finished, but I will enjoy the ride.After big updates the game change near everything, the menu seems more friendly and the game is more playable but it needs some work yet.A great update is the edit options for wrestlers and rings.The wrestler edit menu is quite basic, the main problem is it have to few options (most of them have 3 different options and there are 8 colours), I hope the add more items soon because is hard to make different wrestler when you have to reuse some options because you have 3 options.The ring edit menu is great, but I had the problem that you choose the options with the left stick but it is used to rotate the ring too and you must try to get back to prior position with the right stick to watch what are you doing.You can play a match 1 vs 1 choosing from the wrestlers and rings you have saved. You can choose the IA difficulty and the game works smooth, sometimes it seems slow, but I choose the best graphics option, probably other options are faster (need to try).I missed too much the key display in options easy accessible from the match menu. I don't know how to activate the ""finisher"" when the special displays in the hub.I didn't find any use to run, probably there are no running moves yet.I didn't messed up with the camera because the during game it seems fine, I only get a little annoying with the music, because I'm not used to have music during a match instead the ambient and FX, and commentary...

It's got two buttons, followed by the same animations with little to no progress. He talks about how 10 dollars is cheap but it is not worth it. I'd buy again if it was 2 dollars and had online multiplayer so that I could laugh at it with a friend."

I literally tried out almost everything and I already have my opinions. You see, I am a huge fan of the THQ/AKI games for the N64. When I found out that this game had been touted by the developers as ""The next No Mercy"", I was intrigued. I was a little skeptical though. I thought the game would be a broken mess that wasn't ready for their 1.0 update. Well, thankfully, I was proven wrong! The game actually plays quite well. It has the same feel as the AKI games, which is really what I was looking forward to.Unfortunately, there are some problems I have with the game. The main issue I have is the lack of modes in the game.  I mean you can do matches with up to four wrestlers, but there's little variety and you can't change the rules. The Edit Mode is pretty lackluster too. Sure it's still in the early stages, but I really want to create an appearance, I wouldn't be able to give my wrestler its own moves, which I will get to, but it would still be nice. The other issue I have, and they said they would fix this in the future, is that all the wrestlers have the same moves. I get this is in Early Access, but really? The same moves? Ah well. I guess I will just pick the coolest looking character, Fake Sting. The last issue I have is the camera angle. I feel like it's too low and I can't really see what I am doing or where my moves are gonna make my opponent land.Overall, for a wrestling game, it's pretty damn good! The controls are geat and feel just like the old days. It's just a shame they are charging 10 bucks for a game this limited. I mean, this isn't No Mercy yet. It's more like WCW vs. nWo World Tour (except without any multiplayer whatsoever). But still, if you have any sort of interest in this game, pay the 10 bucks now because they're going to raise the price later!"

76561198084953203,Not Recommended,297310,34442596,Posted: 23 August,all,Creepshow Jordy,"The game used to run good but was even more limited when I first purchased it .After 2 updates it began to run at extremely low frame rates and this game isn't running HD textures that kill frame rates.  It's just a poorly optimized,designed game.Instead of adding moves, the developers are not really listening to their community and are adding pointless features.One thing wrestling games should have right away are Wrestling Moves.  They started adding crowd signs and adding things to the game like editing your wrestler without having hardly any parts, faces and again barely any wrestling moves.What's the point of creating your own wrestler when you only have 5 moves to pick from?  They said this was inspired by WWF No Mercy and Fire Pro wrestling.   The controls are setup like no mercy and the graphics and animations look like they belong on N64 but other then that, not even close.The game runs sluggish,clunky with low frame rates during gameplay and is not fun to play due to serious limitations.I bought this game a long time ago and still only have 2 hours on record because I lose interest in about 10 minutes after each update.Updates for this game are really rare too.No fun modes to play and gameplay that is clunky and runs like crap now because their engine can't handle two wrestlers in an arena of some crowd sprites with 5 moves each and cheap sound effects.I'm a patient guy and understand that it's a small team but this should not have been released as a paid early access game.  They should have worked on the game until they added enough content to keep people busy for alittle while before charging people.  It is only 10 bucks but it's a huge disappointment considering it's been out for years on steam and over a decade old as far as the original concept game and it's still no where near done.I'm 42 now. At this pace I'll be dead by the time these guy finish this game.  The only thing this game deserves is an arena full of the people who bought the game booing the developers for trying to hype up a wrestling turd . Boooo! BOOOO! BOOOOOOOO!"

76561197964486812,Not Recommended,297310,35214046,Posted: 25 September,all,scary jesus,"i'd been watching this game for a while on steam before i decided to buy. it looked like they were regularly updating and things were actually moving along. that continues to be mostly true. the devs need to get their priorities straight. they keep adding features without tweaking the core game much which desperately needs more work. as of this writing, there's a cage match, a shoddy CAW system they keep tweaking, weapons, and they just added hell in a cell and scaffold matches, but the combat system is still glitchy as hell and the gameplay overall is very cumbersome and awkward. i hope this game turns out as the devs envision it, and there has been some promising news recently - the PWX blog just reported that they are progressing toward funding for full time development, wrestling federations are reaching out to them, people are helping them out on audio assets, and they have more time to work on PWX. despite all that, i don't have much faith right now. they're a small team and if this is the best they can do replicating an N64 game in the unreal engine after several years of development - they must not have a ton of experience. i hope they get better devs on board to take this game to a place it deserves.i almost feel bad for the devs leaving a thumbs down, but i can't in good conscience recommend buying this. if you want to take the early access risk and really want to see this game happen, then maybe go for it. but as of right now this is not a game that we can be sure will ever reach its potential."
