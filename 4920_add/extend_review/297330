76561197972677681,Recommended,297330,12702985,"Posted: 30 October, 2014",all,AlienMenace,"Good game but feels incomplete. I made it to 1987 with 30 games and $120K in funds. Then the game announces that I can play through 1987 but no new games will be available which basically means that you arcade has nowhere to go but down. The base gameplay is solid but is lacking details. During my play session, I did find a few things annoying and a few things I would add:1. There is a ""clunk"" sound that seems to be reused too much. It sounds like the same sound when your machine is full of money or some kid is bashing on it or the coin slot is jammed.  The problem is you have some kid running around breaking your games (that you have to pay to fix) but that sound could also be something else far less serious. It should be a unique sound like a kid yelling or something.2. The one employee you can hire is almost useless (but still costs you $800/mo). He will stand around while your machines are full of coins and unable to accept more. You will still have to run around 30 machines emptying the coin boxes over and over and over and over. The jerk won't even re-fill the soda machine. I should be able to pay an emlpoyee more money and have him do a better job. Where are the security guards? Repair techs? By the way, what does the guy at the counter actually do besides nothing?3. Time passes too fast. True in real life too I suppose.4. Not enough games or variety of games. There really is no reason this game should end in 1987. Arcades were still viable up through the mid-1990s. The game should start out in 1970 with pinballs then b&w paddle games then on through the 80s with videos and laser-disc games, and end in the 90s with fighting and gun games. It would be nice to see the evolution of the arcade over a 25-year arc. All games over 6-7 years old should be considered classics.5. There are no redemption-type machines.6. Why am I limited to 30 games? There is floor space for more as it is but you should the option to expand your space.7. Why can't I advertise? Even lemonade stand on the Apple II had this feature. Radio? TV? Flyers? I want to spend some of my scrilla to promote my arcade to make...more...scrilla. How about holding tournaments?8. There should be an option to set the games to free play or nickel play and maybe an option to charge an admission.9. When I saved my game (oh yeah.. why only 1 save game slot?) I had a 5-star arcade. When I loaded it back, I had a 3-star arcade. WTF? I am anxiously awaiting the day when a computer game can have multiple save slots. If only that technology existed. I tell ya, we can put a man on the moon...10. Where is the air hockey table? Seriously guys, there is no such thing as a respectible arcade without an air hockey table.11. Why so few pinball machines and cocktail games? Should not be hard to change the textures to make more. While on the subject, there should be several newly released  games to choose from each month including uprights, cocktails, cockpit, pinballs, etc. One measly new game option per month (or some months, none) is not compelling.Anyhow, this is a good game. It is fun but ultimately the lack of content and very limited flexibility (oh boy I can buy a pumpkin head and a christmas tree) does let it down. In my case, once I got to 1987 and had a successful arcade, there really is no compelling reason to play it again. Recommnded but just barely."

It is not, in fact, a simulation game.  It is very casual, and is more a button masher than a simluation.As a kid who grew up in the 80's and the heyday of arcades, I always wanted to own an arcade.  Being able to pick the games you place, the atmosphere, decorum, ticket prizes, food/beer selection, advertising and promoting it, being able to throw private parties at one...these are all exciting and intruiging ideas to me.  I would quite enjoy the ability to make a custom arcade and to see how well it could actually do based on these choices.Unfortunately, this game only scratches the sruface of those ideas.  You do not serve food/drinks, you have an extremely limited number of games you can purchase, and the decoum is nice looking, but limited.  ""Maintenance"" on a machine involves picking the machine up and hammering the button several times until it starts to work again.   You do not build an arcade, you have a pre-defined space with limited choices on what you can do.  Want a huge two-story mega-arcade?  Can't happen.  The layout of the arcade is the same for every game, so the replay value is extremely low.On top of the lack of building options, there isn't really much of a simulation happening here.  What you see on the screen is not what is occuring behind the scenes, and machines will generate money all day, even when no one is playing.  There seems to be little strategy involved other than ""get the best machines in different genres"" and you win.Overall I was pretty disappointed, and hope one day we can in fact get an arcade simulator.  Unfortunately, this is not it."

There is no replay value what so ever other thantrying to obtain a better high score.2) There is a lot to be desiered. I had no struggle what so ever with the game. I just kept getting the newst gameand it was fine. I even got board and bought all the custimizations you can.3) There is no indepth system. Now on this i dont blame them cause after i played ""Game dev tycoon""I relized that they had the same flaw. You see to me making a simulation game needs to be indepth. A drag anddrop or a slide meter (in the case of game dev) does not really make it a simulation. Yah you can change how much thegames cost to play. However that leads me to 44) no matter what happens if you rasie the price it seems like your doomed. I had 5 Star popularity from like year toand all i did was drop each game diff. to easy and made it a quarter thats it.In counclusion. This game lacks what makes a sim game a sim game. Its more of a place your machine here and thatsreally it. There is no indepth system for you @ all.  I would of like to see some of the followingMarketing. Choosing your building (maybe certin areas have a preff. to certin genre). People accepting harder diff. games and not making it so your game becomes unprofitable if you do that. These are just a few things.Oh by the way the guy you hire to collect your money Hes lazy. Had to do alot my self.However it is a fun game to play. Like i said the first run through thats about it. I still will recommend the game but at a 5$ tag"

Figure it would be similar, but with running an arcade instead of a video game company. After about 12 hours of figuring things out and wasting so much of my time, i finally gave up. The game is nowhere near done, nor worth more then a dollar. There is barely a tutorial to help in the fine details of how the game works. Controls are either slippery or too heavy. I couldn't move anything to where i wanted it without either using the directional keys or practically flailing around with my mouse. Events in game overlap each other to the point where keys tend to freeze and when in the middle of a important action, having the game stop you and drop what you are doing. I have had so many games broken just because when i was taking the problem customer over to the door, the month ended and forced me to let go and the person destroyed it. Pausing is confusing, things still happen during events and menus. Not sure if really paused. Its basically a Facebook game. It’s the worst kind of time waster where I sit here tending to the machines without really interacting with them. Their stats (If they really are stats) have no meaning. They say if I put games in certain configurations, I can maximize popularity. Through all my tests and random ideas, never have I saw a difference in any configuration. It’s like RCT, you put the ride down, it gets popular for a while, then people get bored and you replace it. Except here, the money is so much tighter that after the first two months, your poor as♥♥♥♥♥♥ It is almost impossible to come up positive at the end of the two months. You are going to sell 75% of your games and slowly watch helplessly as the game closes in on you. And even better, when I sold my last game, I just broke even and the game continued. I couldn’t do anything for a month, I had 0$, no games, no vending, and yet still no game over. If I was patient enough, I would have sat there waiting to see what happens. But no, its not worth my time. The best part of the game is the variations of arcade games you can buy… then they ruin that too. It’s the usual cabinets with different textures, no super special games like DDR or Gun games, No fighting games, Overly expensive pinball (only one) game, and a racing game that is also too expensive, but is the most interesting game to look at. I hate to ramble on, but there is so much more. The characters you choose are bland and boring. It’s so bland, why isn’t there a character creation? It would make it slightly better? And the pop machine is a joke. It makes the least amount of money and has to be maintenance every 2 months. It’s a waste. There is this huge space for games and such, but I have only ever been able to fill a small corner (barely) with games. By the time I can afford a new one, I sold like two. Also that god damn post in the middle of the screen drives me crazy. This might just be me, but that post makes movement around the screen harder than it already is and is a general design flaw in my eyes. There is probably more issues im forgetting but this is my biggest problems.TL;DR – Play a Facebook game, it’s the same but more stable than this. Still better built then Ride to hell."

,Not Recommended,297330,11146856,"Posted: 9 July, 2014",all,Radeonic,"Arcadecraft has a lot of potential to be a good fun game, but unfortunately a great idea with a poor execution. The idea of having your own arcade is probably a fun idea for a lot of us that enjoy playing video games and this is supposed to provide a good fun simulation of it.Unlike another similar store simluation game, Recettear, Arcadecraft unfortunatly suffers from almost all aspect of what you should NOT do in this type of game. The idea sounds simple, buy arcade cabinets, set a price and hope you will make a profit from it. But in this game, it seems none of what you do matter and all it is becomes a repetitive dread of hitting spacebar, tab, and enter.Unlike Recettear, there is no point in choosing which cabinet to buy or to find an optimum price or placement of the machine, despite what the game tells you that it does. All you need to do is to save up enough money to buy one of each cabinet, set it in the store, and start smashing spacebar to collect money. Any price/difficulty other than the default will result in an un-optimum pay rates and it seems like cabinet placement gives little incentive/consequence to how popular it will be.Unless you are aiming for a high score to compare to other people, there is really no point or incentive to keep on playing the game. If you can surive the first year with any profits, then you can't possibly lose the game if you just sell the old machine and replace them with new machines. There isn't even any reason to decorate the store as it makes no impacts to the store's popularity.TL;DR, Arcadecraft is repetitive and boring, if you want a good store simluation game, go buy Recettear"

First, the opportunity to manage a video arcade in the 80's is already an excellent idea. It's true the game gets a bit repetitive and lacks real goals once you refund your initial loan. I still love the game for itself, the atmosphere, the mechanic, the arcade games, and moreover, for the music that's not in it: play the game with some carefully chosen 80's music, and the whole becomes a tremendous experience. With the 80's arcade room background, you can find music that fits the game so well, that you'll end up launching the game just for the pair it forms with the music.This music can easily be found: just launch Spotify and search playlists named ""arcadecraft"". You'll find 32 of them, going along the 8 years timeline of the game (1980-1987) each in 4 genres: beats, guitars, synths and voices.

,Not Recommended,297330,20274560,"Posted: 3 January, 2016",all,"Axel ""Not the Real"" Foley","I can't recommend this one. After getting frustrated trying to work the difficulty and quarter algorithms, I realized the way to play this game is to just leave it alone. Literally, leave it alone. This game begins as a semi-AFK arcade simulator where you drop machines, wait til they gather 400 coins, and then farm the machines. You panic somewhere in the middle when, for some stupid goddamn reason, the bank doesn't pull payments from you, and instead demands your loan in full upfront. This is not made known to the player until about 6 months before the loan is due, which still creates a crazy tough hardship in your arcade. I had to restart twice to be able to pay the loan.The good news? Once you pay your stupid damn loan, now your arcade is too profitable. You'll hit 1983 and all of the sudden you have $60,000 in your bank at all times. This will undeniably happen because of how easy the game becomes during the 1982 ""arcade boom"". The game goes from 100 to 0 really quickly. It's just not fun once you have loads of money and the most successful arcade only halfway through the game. The curve was too steep and that's where the developers went wrong."

Individual machines have popularity, which usually increases when the game is cheap/easy. However, increasing the games price per-play seems to make it's popularity take a nose dive, as well as increasing the games difficulty yields the same result (I have absolutely no idea what the direct benefit is to increasing a games difficulty anyways). This typically ends up having all of your machines being very cheap, and very easy, ensuring that you have people playing them all the time. Unfortunately, even keeping all machines occupied as much as possible for an entire month, never seems to yield you much of a profit. Couple this with the fact that moving or empyting the machine seems to force the current player off losing that one sale, and the random ""events"" like repairing a broken machine, makes it so you can only ever break even with your expenses.This wouldn't be so bad, but new machines unlock at the end of every month, giving you the idea that you should constantly be buying new games for your arcade. Instead it simply taunts you, showing you shiny new toys that are forever out of your pitiful financial grasp.I also feel like some sort of graph or chart to illustrate each games strengths and weaknesses would be nice. In its place you have to read a wall of text just to understand what it is you're purchasing exactly, which doens't seem to make any lick of difference what-so-ever in the games popularty.TL;DR - Don't buy this game, its just a glorified click fest that loses its luster very quickly"

I have an interest in the subject as I own a real life pinball machine and two real full size arcade machines. Once completed the game has little replay value which is a shame, and the game has so much potential to improve and expand on the basics that are there. I am not saying I did not enjoy it, but once you have paid off the two year loan there is little challenge. There also seems to be a few bugs\annoyances with the main one being the staff (there is only ever one member of staff avilable to hire) always refuses to empty coins from the same machines. I guess as a player that gives me something to do and keep an eye on, but I would expect my highly paid staff to do their job and empty all machines. I played through the game completely twice and easily managed to get all achievements, also being a little OCD on second playthrough, getting both sets of triology games and keeping the starting 5 machines to the end to see if they would go super classic or anything, which they did not. The Japanese imports also never go classic and the first one will stop making money completely. I like how each machine is individual and unique. It just would be nice if there was more content and challenges, I am thinking at least coin change machines and security staff, but could also be made into a episodic game like Theme Hospital.

Sounds like a great concept for a game, right? You name your arcade and need to buy some games for your customers to play. To make money, you need to keep your games popular, adjusting their prices and difficulty. You'll also need to keep them in working order and replace older machines with the latest popular games. But hold it - some old games can become classics, and they can give your popularity a bonus, as well as increase the popularity of that specific game. So what's wrong with this game?This Game is Too Hard!This game is challenging, but for all the wrong reasons. Many of the game's features are stacked against you and there's little you can do about it. For example - if you get a specific game to be really popular, the logical thing to do would be to raise its price or make it harder to increase your profits. But in game, it doesn't work at all - even daring to increase price or difficulty one notch will bring the game crashing down. Now let me ask the developers - if changing price or difficulty is useless to do, then WHY IS THIS FEATURE IN THE GAME?!The games get a popularity bonus if they are placed next to their own sequels, and your arcade becomes more popular if you have a selection of genres available to play. But there is only minimal indication of this in-game. There is little warning that some games are sequels (Qualify Lap and Fuel Injection, despite both being racing games from the same company, and being the came cabinet with a pallet swap, are NOT related!) or if a game will have a sequel at all, and there is no way to view the overall genre makeup of your arcade (is a screen showing 3 platformer, 5 sports, 4 shooter, 2 racing too much to ask?). Unless you manually check every game you own, you're not going to know. Same thing with classics - some classics become big money earners, but others are a useless game with a fancy title. Oh, randomly some collector with offer you cash for a classic game. Can you view this game before deciding, so as to weigh the decision? Nope!But once you learn how to play and what features to use (sequels, arcade customizing) and not use (pricing, difficulty) then you uncover a different problem...This Game is Too Easy!I can hear you already: ""You just said it's too hard! Now you say it's too easy?! Pick one, moron!""But really, this is one of those games that's ""hard to learn, easy to master"". Once you understand which games become classic money spinners, have sequels, etc.  then no challenge remains. The moment you pay off your debt, the game might as well stop and declare you the winner, because there is nothing to stop you after that. Oh, there IS stuff to do - make sure you move an arcade cabinet to an arbitrary spot, manually empty change boxes, and fix broken games. Seriously, what was the point of all these ""features""? It's just tedious busywork stopping you from leaving the game running. Did we really need random power outages, which do nothing but make you click each cabinet twice?This game could've been quite fun. This game should've been fun. But as it stands, it's a waste of $12.99."

I've been a fan of both management style games and old school arcades for some tame.  This game barely delivered either.On the first point, the management in this game is minimal making the entire game too easy by far.  Ultimately all you do is make sure you buy a new game or two every month, upgrade the few upgrades you can when you can, then spend the rest of the time clicking on machines as they fill with quarters/need a repair.  The scant challenges and decisions that don't involve your machines are either mundane or just a break in the flow of... well OK it's a welcome change from just draining quarters from stuffed machines.On the second, unless you know the history of arcades there is very little to glean over your scant seven year run as an arcade owner.  It makes nods to the video game crash, gives a few details when certain games got popular and declined, and does little else to educate a younger crowd into the way things were.This game is certainly something that would be better off staying  on a tablet or mobile phone.  If it expanded how you interacted with the arcade, let you manage more employees, expand your shop beyond the definitions of your initial arcade, let you run your arcade as long as you choose to the current day (And of course adding more examples of arcade history, through parody of course), then you'd have something for PC.

In that regard, it's difficult to build up a large amount of cash on hand, so you end up forced to sell off a bunch of games to pay off the loan, after which the games you have left aren't making enough money to allow you to build back up and you go bankrupt.  On top of that, the games break, or are broken, occasionally and need repairs, so the games aren't very profitable in the long run.I'm sure there's a way to figure it out and make it work, but i bought this for a casual game of mind-numbing fun, not a tedious game of intricate book-keeping.If you're looking for a fun build-a-company style game, I prefer Game Dev Tycoon.  If you want a build-a-company style game with a little RPG adventure thrown in, get Racettear."

I've only been able to survive 2 years (1980 & 1981), which in game time is not all that long.  I've tried numerous techniques, concentrating on just buying games, sprucing up the place more than buying games, buying vending machines along with games, and an amalgamation of all of the above.   The result is always the same.  You lose.And that's the problem.  The game doesn't seem to allow you to portray any semblance of a successful arcade of the time.  I have only ever been able to max the number of arcade machines owned at 6, and that my friend, doesn't remind me of a booming arcade of the era.I don't mind hard games like FTL if the experience feels rewarding as you play.  Unfortunately the balance between the amount of money you receive in Arcadecraft, and it's various pricing structures of things you need to buy, are highly unbalanced.  You're always poor.  In fact, this causes the game to feel unrewarding past the first 3 or 4 months in game time.  You boom for the first few months, but then every month after that you slowly watch your Arcade decay into nothingness.  I've seen arcades that have been successful for years and that's not the case in Arcadecraft.  [Quick Note:  Even when you run out of arcade machines, because you had to sell them all to pay off debt, and you have no other way to make any more money, you have to watch a lonely representation of yourself sit behind a counter watching the days roll by.  The game itself doesn't realize the endgame has come and lets you live a couple extra months with nothing to do before the inevitable end.  OK, you could also just restart the game.]And maybe that's the point of the game.  To let you know how futile it is to open an arcade.  Maybe the game is trying to show you historically how stupid the dream of owning an Arcade really was.  I on the other hand, want to remember Arcades as they were to me, a fun place to get my game on and to hang out with my buddies!  And being provided the tools to create my own Arcade, I want to provide my virtual people with that same kind of fun.  If this game took a queue from more successful sim titles like Sim City, or even Rockstar Ate My Hamster, this would be more fun.  Mainly because history doesn't have to repeat itself.As it is, I can recommend Arcadecraft as a ""pretty to look at"" diversion, and a short enjoyable piece of nostalgia.  Pick it up only if it's on sale.  I got it for just under 5 dollars."

It's some pretty good fun if you were born in the 80s like me and actually remember arcades before they were dead things full of over-sized iPhone games.

,Recommended,297330,10203866,"Posted: 22 May, 2014",all,curly_nuts,"This is a good game and can be quite addictive. What I liked about it was  being able to design your own arcade with a variety of games you can choose from. It's cool being able to set up the arcade to maximize profits. It reminds me a lot of those old sim games, like sim-hospital, where you kinda have to think ahead in design and utilization of space in order to succeed.As I mentioned, the game can get very addictive. You constantly have to keep up a stream of cash flow to pay the rent and to keep your arcade up-to-date. It's not easy and games lose their appeal to customers quickly. You're often forced to resort to selling older, less popular games in order to keep up with the trends. As you progress, you can change the design of the arcade and even move into different locations.Surprisingly, there's more to do than to just place arcade cabinets and collect money. For example, you may have to eject an unruly customer, repair machines, keep vending machines stocked, clear coin jams, and constantly empty coin banks to keep the machines running.I didn't have a problem with the price considering that this was a finished, full game and I did not encounter any bugs or problems playing it."

The problem is that once you've played it through once and gotten the achievements, the only replay value is trying to beat your high score (in terms of cash).What would really improve this game:1. An endless mode - where the game doesn't feel like it needs to be bound to real video game history, and you can keep running your arcade for as long as you want, maybe even eventually making the transition to a modern Nickel Arcade or mixed establishment a la Dave & Busters.2. Steam Workshop support - so real games can be modded in and MORE games (real and slighly changed names) modded in.3. Expandability of arcade past 30 games.Recommended, but as is, wait for a sale.

If you grew up in the 80's and lived at the arcade like I did, you'll probably enjoy this. That's assuming you like simulation games. Now...this game is not deep. It's pretty to look at, but there is so much to mine here, and this game barely scratched the surface. I'd love to see a sequel that is a little less frantic, has more employees to hire, has more facility upgrade opportunities and better analytics.

76561198048574801,Recommended,297330,14232366,"Posted: 29 January, 2015",all,tomahawkza,"Arcadecraft is a business simulation game.  The graphics and sound are decent and the game supports 1920  x 1080 and even higher resolutions.  The pace of the game is extremely frenetic and it is extremely hard to maintain sufficient income to cover both the monthly expenses and repayment of the initial loan.While Arcadecraft is fun to play it does become evident that the designers were onto a great idea, but that the final execution needs more polish.  For one thing the pace of the game feels rushed and there is not enough time for the player to actually take a breath and enjoy perusing the stats and do proper planning.Theme Park and Theme Hospital both had better pacing and more content and felt more complete.  Hopefully the designers will take cogniscence and inspiration from those and improve the game to make it more player friendly.The ability to rent different arcade venues and to place machines at local businesses would fluff the game out a bit more.Competition with rival arcades is a missed opportunity.  The possibility of setting up the arcade at a go-kart track or an ice rink are also missed opportunities.  Machine rental to events like carnivals or to school cafeterias would have also been a nice feature.  A bigger variety of vending machines and some incidental furnishing and decor would also be a good feature.  Addition of things like a pay phone, coffee shop, hotdog stall etc would also have added something.So ultimately the player is left feeling the game concept is solid, but that the game is not complete.Certainly worth a look and a few hours if the game is on a 50% or better discount.  Bear in mind though that Arcadecraft does not have a high re-playability factor.  This review will be revised if the game is improved by the developer.Rating 5/10"

,Not Recommended,297330,13827057,"Posted: 4 January, 2015",all,Etheras,"A really tempting title with fun mechanics that unfortunately suffers from an almost impossible flaw. By the time the 2 years is up on the loan, its virtually impossible to be in the black. I don't say this with a sense of bravado: after failing on multiple attempts, I looked up strategies online, and found that I am not the only one suffering from this problem. In the trainers that do describe strategy, they are describing strategies that work on the original platform, rather than the steam version. I followed these trainers to the letter... they say you can get $1500 / mo on soda if you charge $1. Yet I received $2600 on soda after TWO YEARS. Clearly the developers thought that this was an exploit, and ""patched"" it, only to make their game impossible to win.The difficulty is definitely much higher on the Steam release than the original platform. I find that game cabinet placement almost never gives more than 1 star. So-called ""Classic"" games don't noticably offer more business or revenue  or even much of a popularity bonus to themselves, despite claims by the game hintboxes, that they do.So in the end: unwinable game, negative review. Some of you might cry foul at this, or that I simply didn't find ""the right way"", but even if that were true (and I don't believe that it is), a simulation game with only one way to win, doesn't seem like a good simulation game to me. It should be as-if I owned and was running an arcade, not a test of my ability to read the minds of the developers.Unless you want a Sisyphus simulator of grind-tastic unwinableness, buy a different game. This one is a waste of time and money."
