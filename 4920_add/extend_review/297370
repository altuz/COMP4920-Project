76561198140299850,Recommended,297370,18107332,"Posted: 19 September, 2015",all,foofaraw,"“Hero of Many” is a very clever game, and that’s a word rarely used these days. Seemingly a metaphorical game of light versus dark, with no gray areas. You play as a small blob of light, and it’s that blob that the player controls with the mouse.But you don’t play against the forces of darkness unassisted. Nor will you stay a small blob. As you travel through what is apparently an underwater world, you come across stationary small blobs, and close proximity causes you both to merge, increasing your size. You will also encounter fish-looking characters: bright ones will join you, dark ones will attack you and your “swarm”. Perhaps you can sneak past the dark ones, or attract some away, keeping battles small and manageable. But there seem to be some larger dark creatures that cannot be defeated, and your swarm cannot protect you against them for long….“Hero of Many” seems simple, and to some degree it is. But you are given almost no instructions, which adds to the game’s complexity. The world you inhabit is large, with many small and intertwining passages. Lights go on along the edges to show where you’ve been, and large crystals act as highly visible save points. The goal is to advance to a sort of “drain”, leading to the next level, with as many swarm members as possible.Others things will be encountered in the game. As your swarm progress in the game it will encounter food, dangerous plants (or not, how to tell?) and large swarms of dark enemies. Also, they will constantly lose small bits of light, weakening steadily. Individual swarm members aren’t smart, and will easily get separated or lost from the main swarm. The larger the swarm, the harder to lead or control, and the more likely lost to the dangers they will encounter. But, the greater the protection offered by larger swarms.“Hero of Many” is a surprisingly endearing game, and rapidly develops a sense of personality. The swarm is so dedicated to providing protection that the desire to return that protection is very strong. The save point are logical and reasonable, and I can only imagine that further levels become more challenging and interesting. At this low (discount) price, I would give “Hero of Many” my strongest recommendation.Thank you."

The adventure and immersion of the game are next to none. I'd recommend this game to people who enjoy games like journey. It is one of those games where you feel attachment to these little balls of light, even though they have no backstory, and you really have no idea what they are. They are cute, calming, and you have an urge to help them.The more I play this game, the more I get deeper into the story, and want to continue. This game is very well done, and I truly recommend it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2fm1G118l8&index=1&list=PLFVyJ-U8SjkPHmkrorLoCrlOldhqjcBp9&channel=UCJDOzAhZY9AZAVWGEuKVG9g"

76561198007688772,Recommended,297370,20614483,"Posted: 18 January, 2016",all,Aargh,"Honestly, I was thinking of giving this game a negative review. And I probably I would have done it if I hadn't found some empathy for this little czech studio...The game starts great. Nice visuals, great atmosphere and fantastic, FANTASTIC music. The gameplay is simple but quite entertaining. But soon the first flaws will surface:You outrun the screen. Yes, the bane of old side-scrollers has returned. Often the camera is just not fast enought to follow you properly and then you basically can't see where you are going. Run into a mine and say goodbye to your beloved swarm.Unskippable cutscenes! How is this still a thing?! No, I really don't need to see the same animation for the 20th time after loading the checkpoint, goddammit!The game barely explains anything. For example, I've finished it and still I'm not sure what those energy orbs were useful for.In a game where everything around you is glowing white it's not a good idea to make the mouse cursor a tiny white circle. I was constantly losing track of it, having to pause the game to actually find the cursor.Hero of too many levels - yes, the game is too long. Game with such a simple gameplay gets repetitive fast and it doesn't introduce enough new mechanics or environments to keep it fresh.And then came level 17 - saving the Red queen. I still have no idea how to finish the level properly. You're supposed to go through a tunnel, pass some obstacles and finally reach the queen but the tunnel is blocked at the end and I've never found a way to open it. After many attempts I gave up and checked the only available walkthrough on YouTube.The youtuber did something I would have never thought of - he ignored the tunnel and using a weird trick he got into a different tunnel that seemed to be inaccessible. He went through, ignored the queen and went straight to the exit and somehow succeeded. And yes, this is the only way that seems to be working. What stupid design is that?From now on the game went into a ""wtf am I supposed to do"" mode. I'm not going to talk about every flawed level so let's just mention the final bosses (spoilers ahead).The dragon boss seems to be pretty straightforward, the problem is there is no indication you actually damage him. I was circling around him like crazy not sure if there is an end to it because I had no idea if I'm actually hitting him (thankfully I was, he just had a ton of hitpoints).The final boss is actually even worse. I've beaten him on my fourth attempt yet I have no idea how did I do that. He just started dying around the lanterns even he was ok around them a minute before... I don't know... I was pretty annoyed by the game by then so I was glad it was over.Overall: It's a decent game with some major design flaws, especially in the last third. We really need a neutral rating on Steam."

This game would have been perfect/briliant if it had had few levels less and if it had had only 3 hours of playtime.Great experience anyway.Btw, game is port of mobile game so options are really limited (you can set volume level)."

Graphically the game is artistic, yet simplistic.  You playas an egg shaped character that collect eggs, and counter a villain that chases youand kills your kind.The gameplay feels more like a survival game as you try to make it through eachmap.  The game has a mellow tone most of the time, adding to the casual atmosphere.The game is pretty long, and during the entire time, the aesthetic stays the same.The level design is done very well, but the sameness of the levels getsvery repetitive.  There are a few elements that change, but overall they don't varythe levels enough to inspire the player.The combat is sound, but is nothing special.  If you don't mind casual gamesthat are very repetitive, this might be a game to get, if on sale.  It's not horrible,but I don't see myself playing this game again, or buying this game knowing what Iknow now.This is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watchif you are looking for a more in-depth review.Thanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:http:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho"

The enemy is enviroment and other agressive eggs and creatures (remember it is very abstract so you can imigine what you want). Playing the game is very simple, you control egg with mouse and in futher you can use keyboard for three other function of egg (distract, lure your friends and attack). It´s hard to describe, but I´ve felt it´s nice to play on ipad, but on pc I need more competitive gameplay.

There's lots of color and space for metaphors regarding light vs. darkness, black on white, and stuff.General feeling after finishing?Very minimalistic setting that works well. I especially enjoying all the swimming and rescuing friends as well as discovering the levels. The game is quiet, but well paced, has no indication of ""damage"" (even when ""fighting"") and tells a story without words. The content of the story is, of course, open to interpretation, and uh... you SHOULD play it!Story?It can mean a lot of different things, so experiencing it is the best way to figure out what it's about.Gameplay?Works well with a PS3 controller and you mostly spend your time ""swimming"" and eating stuff, growing and shrinking when ""attacked"".Graphics?It's gorgeous, and the level design is mostly superb.Sound & Music?Sound design seems simple (that's probably its strength) but well adapted to the game. The music has that spacey feeling most of the time and I especially enjoyed the joyful parts where the music is very uplifting. It's mostly orchestrated music even if written in a machine (I don't know).Replayability?I guess it has some, yes..."

Going through the game, you want to keep your white fish with you, but they get caught on all manner of things or just fall behind. As a result, I find myself going back trying to get them out repeatedly. Perhaps you are supposed to leave them there, but that leaves you vulnerable to the black fish and makes you feel kind of like a a-hole (it's hero of many, not deserter of many).I also find the noise the black fish make to be quite irritating (it's a shrill monkey-like noise).The puzzles provided in the game are easy and far between. As a result, most of what you'll be doing is accidentally losing your fish as you go through a tunnel. Or accidentally trapping yourself by rolling a rock you thought you needed to move into the only exit, efficiently blocking it and forcing you to start over.On the plus side, check points are frequent, the music is nice (but not outstanding), and the game looks good."

The gameplay is pretty simple, and while you do get some new abilities, it's mostly about guiding and taking care of your little group and make sure that they don't take on too many enemies at a a time.Unfortunately, the gameplay does get repetitive after a while, and it's not really interesting enough to support the 7 or so hours the game takes. Several times I thought a cutscene meant the end, only to be put in a very similar level only with different background color. At the end I was just rushing through, not exploring, having lost the patience. If you want to invest the time for an at times very lovely and meditative experience, it's well worth it , even though it gets long-winded.In conclusion,  a wonderful little game - but outstays it's welcome a bit by being simply too long for the very basic game play."
