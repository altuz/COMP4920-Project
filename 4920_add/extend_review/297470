Its interesting, but not worth the price per month....   The graphics are par at best,  the animations are barbaric,    There is no missile weapons, so its all hand to hand fighting.   I got bored after a week, and abandoned my last 3 paid weeks,  Cause it just too dang boring!!!"

I was regretting buying the game, much having monthly payments. I guess everyone loves monthly payments, I would too.  Some things are very frustrating in this game. Since I just left long message in forum, I will keep it short here. I went throught most the tutorial. Some things are easy to find, some things I do not have a clue. I am not impressed with what others have built and gave up on I guess. Looks abandoned to me. I am bored to rashes. I went in all excited, but came out withered and contorted.I can't even recommend this game for $29 much less monthly payments along with with it. I bought one of the Dev's lunch, unless they went to a Taco Place, then maybe I bought the whole staff! I maight try about one more hour and see. I can always change to a positive report. At least if I could made a new leather bag in decent time, it would be a plus.  I got tons of leather, but I cannot find a needle to sew with.  And running is too slow, get very tedious. Other than that, that fishing was fun, finally caught a huge shark!!! (wink)"

This is completely dead, not a soul. There are SOOOO many options, buttons, etc. I've played many mmorphs like WoW, Tera, RIFT, etc. They all have a pretty straightforward setup, there was a terraforming skill I managed to find and everytime I went to atempt to use one of the abilities I got the response 'YOU MUST HAVE A SHOVEL EQUIPPED IN YOUR LEFT HAND' well I had already dragged a shovel to said hand, even tried switching it and my dagger, no luck.Just insanely confusing, GUI was not much better, graphic wise it looks better int he sceenshots than actual gameplay. If it's just one guy, it's pretty cool, but compared to all of the other games out there similar to this that have come out, it's not even in the same ballpark."

This game is a sandbox game where you can build a cool base, go hunting....explore the world. It's the kind of game where you have to make your own fun. The game won't hold your hand or tell you what to do. If you enjoy building in games, you should totally take a look at this game. As this is a sandbox game, it does involve a lot of grinding to raise your characters skills. At the moment the community for this game is small but friendly. The downside of this game is the progress and updates are somewhat slow and you need a lot of patience to wait for updates. I play on the PvE server... i enjoy building, crafting, trading, fishing, hunting or just running around the map to see peoples bases :) I could spend hundreds of hours in the game but it is not for everyone. Go on youtube, watch a ton of videos and make your decision :)"

Stay far away from it if you're looking for something that it is actually worth your money. The month you get with buying the game is fun, if you find some established players you can enjoy being around. After that, the $15 monthly fee is really hard to fork up.Saying the combat is crude would be a complement, and you are punished for completely filling up your food and water bar. If you can get around these playing elements, as it is still early access, then I would love to hear even one good reason to lump this with any other subscription based game that asks for that kind of money. I hear some people boast the terrain is pretty. I would say its more like a pretty big pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and the best graphical quality still pales in comparison to any other subscription based game.""But the subscription is optional"",  you might say. It really isn't. All your skills are limited to 30 instead of 100. Are you okay doing 30% normal damage and taking 330% more damage. Because thats what low quality stuff you will be stuck with. That, or you can leach off someone else for high quality items."

I put off getting this game and tried Albion, Elder Scrolls, Shroud of the Avatar, Wurm...none of them did me any good. I'm an old school player, and enjoy open world/sandbox play with no questing or linear gameplay. This game is about as sandbox as it gets. I'm already addicted! If you like action MMO's this is not up your alley, but if you like unlimited freedom and a complex crafting game with a little combat thrown in, this one's for you.Also, anyone reviewing this game with less than a couple hours played hasn't even finished the tutorial and has no business commenting on it. Yes the tutorial takes that long - longer actually. This game is NOT for those who want instant gratification and think graphics make a game. The graphics are more than good, they're just not cutting edge. If that's what you want spend your money elsewhere.This game makes you work hard for everything you do. THAT's the challenge. Can you handle it?"
,Recommended,297470,22536257,"Posted: 20 April, 2016",all,WickedPuppy,"I played this game years ago when it first came out and all you could do was terraform the landscape. It quickly lost my attention. I picked it up when it came out on Steam and outside of the low server population, this is a must have game for those into survival/building games. If you like crafting, gathering supplies, exploring, and building structures you will find plenty to do. You can build roads, terraform the landscape, farm the land, cut down trees, build everything in game, and all of this is visible to other players. Everything in game ages and/or gains xp. That Reverant that killed you an hour ago, stole your clothes and shovel from your corpse and now struts around with those items on him, taunting you to come kill him to get it back.Amazingly this game is ran by a single developer; yet, has more thought and work done to it then most MMO's on the market today. If you are looking for a game where twitchy fingers wins the day, this is not that game. This is a survival game, with what could be an attempt at a Trading simulation game. Although there are many aspects of the game that remain unpolished, it is extremely playable and stable, and simple in many regards.The learning curve is somewhere in between WoW and EVE online. It does not appear to have the same depth as EVE Online, but give this game a full staff of developers and it could easily come close over time. The next UO, probably. The next WoW, possibly. It just would depend which direction it went. Of course, neither matter if the graphics do not keep up.The immediate downfall of the game is that the communications systems in game are horrible and most people are into solo gameplay. A new person joining the game is dropped into the middle of a huge map (literally can take hours to travel from one part to another). The server population is so low that I have only seen other players when I requested to meet them in person and travelled to their location. However, everyone is extremely nice and friendly. If the developer moved in the direction of an EVE economy I think this game would have serious staying power, and be able to expand rapidly. However, if one cannot view at distances items for sale, then one might as well be playing a solo or cooperative game, not an MMO. This game needs some way to allow a greater sense of where you as an individual, as a tribe stand in relation to others.Overall, I recommend this game, with the reservations noted above."

I am older, in my 60's but have played mmo's since they first came out.I have played all the major old school mmo's like Everquest, and many of the newer class of games like Allods, terra and the like. Im a huge fan of seamless 3d environments, and really like the feel of Xsyon.One thing I really like, is that I don't have to rush to the ""end"" here. With so many skills to work with and so many things to craft and build, I reckon i'll be here for years.Oh, and speaking of building, you should see the amazing things people build in this game! I have been on a walk about all over, and have seen things like full sized castles, indoor swimming pools, paddocks for animals, and cool little villages. I have not don't much building yet but from what i gather from players, its a module style building system, with things like wall, truss, and roof parts that you can put together in many different combos. Plenty of styles to choose from as well.I've done a fair bit of crafting so far and it is pretty typical of other games. I do like the way this game provides the baski tools you need to give it a go. I learned the hard way that the first thing you should do with your starter tools is make more starter tools!  I reckon my next project will be to make me some armour.The community in this game is true blue. Always helpful and willing to keep ya going. Like, they warned me not to mess with ""revs"" yet till I was a bit more experienced. Once I found them at an abandoned homestead, I know what they meant. Imagine sick starkers running around trying to kill you and you have the picture. Most had twice the hit points I had and I had to run away not to die. I have'nt even tried animals yet, but I'm sure that day will come.All in all, this game may not be your cuppa, but if you enjoy a good community, and time to make your mark, then you are gonna love this game. Please don't take my word for it though, just go all in and try it mate!  You won't regret it!"
,Recommended,297470,32842047,Posted: 26 June,all,legend552,"Ok, so this game gets a lot more flak than it deserves. It IS understandable though why most people wouldn't enjoy it. It's a game that take a LOT of time to get use to, and what most people don't know is the true purpose of this game. It was meant to be a role playing game that is player driven, with quests that players created, and players would specialize in 1-2 skills and be that way. The gameplay is a slow progression, and I mean slow, but is pretty nice with friends. I have only played it with one friend, and he's really endowed into this game, and I am pretty into it as well. The theming is great, as is the art and concept of the tools. However, the combat is a different story. The combat is twitch based, which is great for PvP, as I play on the PvP server (There is a PvP and PvE server). However, it's not that way with enemies such as creatures. The creatures attack way too fast, and do way too much damage for how fast they attack. Some enemies called Revenants use the Twitch based combat, but as I said, they attack with too much damage for how fast they swing. Once you get used to the combat, you'll be able to progress from small critters to mediocre critters, to medium creatures and critters, and large/deadly critters/creatures. I level them by their HP and Attack strength. The building system is phenominal, you're able to create these pretty nice structures, however you'll need to increase your skills to build better things, as expected. The cooking system is great, the cookable objects have flavors which you need to balance out to make a fully nutritious food item without penalties (Food effectiveness reduction). As said though, you will need dedication for some skills, such as some craft skills, as you'll need to effectively grind EXP manually, which can be time consuming, so you'll need some time to kill. If you have a friend, it'll be great. You can adventure together, and you can create quests together. The tutorial is pretty time consuming, and if you want better help and explanations, you should ask people in the chat. All in all, great game, it's ashame but partially understandable the amount of flak it has been recieving."

I love sandbox games!I can agree that this game is not newbie friendly as the tutorial is just something you read.I reccomend to any new player to ask the community for help as we are very friendly.Don't let these negative reviews turn you away from this game.Xsyon is a game kinda like WURM in the sense of grind a skill to lvl it up. The terraforming is better I believe than WURM. I have tried to plau WURM and just cant get used to the controls. Where as Xsyon controls are a little more easily understandable.The Devs are awesome! Time to time they will talk to the community in-game and ask for oponioins. Literally that alone is amazing! Come on to Xsyon and see for yourself.The graphic requirements are low enough for a laptop to handle with hardly any issues.If you decide to play follow these small tips1,) I reccomend googling ""Xsyon Map"" (You will need this)2.) Try to get into a TRIBE (Guild) as soon as possible)3.) DO NOT!!! Make a Troll Charater-- You Height and Weight does effect your gameplay, so playing a short and fat midget means you will be able to carry a little more but run out of endurance faster."

Second, it takes a lot for a game to hold my interest and I haven’t had success with MMORPGs for many years. I’m so happy I took the risk!I’ve been playing on the Peace (PvE) server for several weeks. The community is small enough where you get to know the other players and everyone is friendly and helpful. They’re very welcoming to new players and you can tell from how they talk about the mechanics, that the players are dedicated and really love the game.My favorite feature is being able to pick out a place almost anywhere on the map to create and customize a homestead. While many of the aspects of Xsyon aren’t entirely unique, they’re executed in a way that is rewarding and a lot of fun. If you enjoy crafting focused sandbox games, I suggest giving it a try!"

This game is a rare gem that i have been looking for a long time. Extremely in depth crafting system and just plain fun to play. It has its share of negative reviews but I find it to be a well thought out and implemented game. The player population is pretty low....but I believe that will change. Give it a try.....if you....like me are looking for an in depth crafting/survival/mmo....you wont regret it. It has a steep learning curve but it is worth it once you have learned how to play it properly. The graphics are not triple A....but they are good and unique which creates an a great atmposphere for the game. The community is warm and friendly....(at least on the PVE server....I havent played on the PVP server yet)...and willing to help new players. In my opnion....the developers of this game have done a great job....and they continue to improve it. This game does not deserve all the negative reviews it has gotten on steam in my opinion.....these reviews mostly come from people who bought the game and got something different from what they were expecting and didnt know there was a sub to keep playing after a month. I dont know if the sub warning was there when it was first placed on steam....but its there now and you can also keep playing for free if you wish but with a skill cap or 30. Don't judge this game til you've tried it....it is a very refreshing take on this kind mmo....that i havent see in years and i've played a lot of mmos. And for those of you with older computers like me.....it does work on Windows Vista Home Premium and runs fine. Lastly....my opinion on the sub: paying a subscription to play an mmo doesn't bother me if it is a good game that I will enjoy spending some of my free time on. ""Game On People!"""

You can go out collection resources for the many different crafts like the Armors (Cloth, Grass, Leather, Bone,) there is toolcrafting weaponcrafting and a pretty cool building system.If your like me and like to hunt for food and crafting matts then there is that to. You kinda have to ""hunt"" out your prey to get your food and crafting matts. Make sure you have a knife and enter combat mode by pressing C before attacking! :PAnyways this a pretty great game.

76561198122944962,Recommended,297470,31547112,Posted: 4 May,all,Alyngwen Clævyan,"TL;DR: Like grindy games? Play. Don’t like grindy games? Don’t play.As I stand at the edge of a small peninsula located between two waterfalls that cascade down into the valley below I marvel at the beauty of the – for a nooby rather dangerous –surroundings of the aptly named two-man community “Twin Fall Town”.The idyllic spot – that was chosen for beauty rather than functionality – is, to say the least, a bit of a challenge, and a struggle at most. Wild bears, hostile hounds, over-sized racoons (maybe the radiation has something to do with that?), and savage coyotes often interrupt the flow of our day while we’re trying – after 19+ hours in-game – to still finish the crude barricade around our soon-to-be-town, that will hopefully one day save our lives a few times in the future. For now, however, it is a long and slow battle against nature where we are the unwelcome guests.Welcome to Xsyon; an Early Access Post-Apocalyptic Open-World Online Survival game with Role-Playing elements. That’s a whole mouthful and the time it takes to pronounce this gives you a rough idea of the length of the game.Before you read any further, however: if you don’t appreciate a (very rewarding) grind-game: close the tab, delete this game from your wish list and move on.If you do enjoy a slow-paced game in a huge open world with survival, building, crafting, and battling the elements (or other players on the PvP server) whilst having tons of recipes to discover and stats to improve – and most important of all; you don’t mind grinding it full-on – than look no further: this is the game for you.Xsyon is still in early access which does mean you’ll have to deal with the odd bugs – such as not being able to run up a steep hill, while a bear or racoon easily walks up a vertical waterfall (obviously, a horizontal waterfall is called a river) – and updates are not released very often as it is being made by a small team.But the game is enjoyable! The amount of content it already has (which seems to be expanding a lot over the next few months) is astonishing. The grind – although at times you really feel you should do something else in between before you start going crazy – is actually quite spot on; you don’t build a village in a day, you don’t learn all recipes in three hours, and you don’t catch a fish every time you throw out your line, right?If you’re reading this I’m assuming you’ve got some affinity with survival games, too, so you’ll be familiar with the hunger/thirst aspect of this genre. Whereas many survival games (I’m looking at you, The Black Death) have a hunger-rate that goes down faster than a fat kid on a seesaw, Xsyon seems to have found a rather good balance, and a nice addition is that you shouldn’t “fill up” on food or water until your bar is at 100% as this will affect your character (and not in a good way).Also the day/night cycle takes a lot longer than in many other (early access) survival games. Beyond Despair is a dark setting anyway, but the nights seem to last forever; The Black Death (sorry, I’m still a huge fan of this game) has finally added a day/night cycle to their game, too, which is long and pitch-black; Xsyon has 9-hour in-game days. That’s pretty long, and in my opinion enjoyable, too, because of the game’s “grindy-ness”. You really need that time to scavenge for resources and you’d get really cranky if every 20 minutes the world goes dark for a friggin’ hour.In other words; Xsyon most definitely has added the survival aspect, but has implemented it in such a delicate way that you at some point think: “It’s been a while; my character might be a bit hungry, let’s break the grind and go fishing instead.” rather than “I’d like to go to [location] but I have to eat 15 apples, 2 loaves of bread and a basket of sour grapes and then scavenge for food first before I… Oh now it’s dark again; better wait till morning.”I do recommend playing with a friend if you want to start a tribe of your own, or you may want to join an existing tribe before setting off on your own so you can level up your skills first. In my experience the players on PvE (Peaceful) are very polite and helpful and will give new players some basic free gifts just to help them on their way (a few pouches and a basket, which you can’t make at the start of the game, are very welcome gifts).Xsyon may not be the most beautiful game on the market (graphically), the game needs performance updates as at times it runs quite poorly in forests, and some of the character’s movements are a bit wonky at times (running can be almost “slow-motion-like” on certain surfaces, while walking anywhere seems as if your character’s legs have been placed in spleens and he/she was then refused to use crutches), but none of this matters as you slowly grind away trying to make something of your life in the wilderness before winter arrives and you’re going to be royally [......]."

I have found a tribe ldr that is willing to give me tools if i join his tribe (he might give them even if i didnt join).  This problem nearly caused me to give up playing because you cant play without the tools.  all the basic tool receipes should be there, and make you scavenge or harvest the materials to make them.  more advanced tools could be hard to get but not beginner tools.I do thank all the experienced players for all their help when i ask questions in chat."

It's clunky and takes even more work than everything else to raise your skill in it, with the running and chasing of prey.

I've been playing for a while now and seen 1st hand a lot of people more than willing to mentor any new players who are having a rough time.I will warn you though, it does move at a very slow pace rather your gathering, hunting, farming, or building.All in all I highly recommend this game if you're looking for a builder to sink your time into"

The community while small (semi average for a sandbox indie) it is a polite and dedicated group - the 15dollars a month keeps most angry children and trolls from really being a threat to your gaming exp and to me thats worth it after having been trolled in dozens of games (didn't work but still is a waste of my limited time) with them randomly attacking me or blowing something up for no reason and taking hours and hours to repair (far more hours then it would take for me to earn the 15 dollars) so as such the monthly fee keeping the game going me not having to buy 25-40$ a month/week in cash shops to keep up with people and no paid expansion packs or DLC means I am exactly the same as everyone else in the game complete and total fairness - yeah skill based put into the game and be stronger not paid to win - the xsyon style I do enjoy the tribal indian post apocalypse blend, the several choices of buildings tools weapons and armor was very nice as I'm able to really create either a scavenger society of metal and tires or a pioneer camp of logs or even a grass and twig town allowing for large customization of my settlementso now time for the pro and cons- great sandbox building set with structures being as big or as small as you need with several varities of buildings fences and- lots of choices for clothing weapons and tool styles each needing different resources- limited grinding for resources or construction - moderate to average on skills high level skills actually making you work for them instead of being given to you.- good blends of skill selection - starting kits tailored to your choices at start up - select axe as your weapon you get a axe select pick you get a pick ect ect - no starting short sword and shield generic kit- solid community willing to talk and helpcons-the games a bit confusing out of the gate - and needs a new tutorial / upgraded wiki majorly but after a week its not bad- limited decorations for inside a house - outside a house plenty of choices but not allot of furniture rugs ect- no current taming system - its in the works and I will remove this once its in- combat is a bit hit and miss atm - you can kill most small animals (squirels hampsters bunnys) but they tend to run from you and the actual click to hit system is a bit sensative meaning you have to hit a small animal running through the grassand its a bit difficult at times - they are supposed to be increaseing the hit detection area on small animals to remedy this and will be removed when added- no ranged combat - only melee weapons sorry- limited pvp - as the core game everyone uses is main job atm pvp feels a bit left out and the pvp server has very few people spaced far out on it.the pro/con - this is the section that could go either way for you - some like these options some don't - and some I just have mixed feelings toward-few to no trolls - might not be a big deal to you but I have a job / family / and life away from computer so knowing I won't have to log in and deal with some angry child blowing up half my town cause his parents told him he couldn't go out with friends is major bonus for me- low player base - this is a game of hundreds to thousands not hundreds of thousands it is ment to be a small market game catering to the people who enjoy this kind of game not to the masses - to me this is big as finding a unique game mmo not just a mini run your own server game is a big pro for me as I feel like I know those around me at same time people get a bit quiet at times which can be a turn off for others- many features have not been implamented - the current game is solid but allot of those I would really like features are coming but not yet in the game - while I can't wait for them to get in game I also can't wait. . . . seriously I want them now lolsso would I buy this game again? Yes - Will I play this game hard core for years? probably off and on yes like any sandbox this is a game you will keep coming back to once you have had your fill and keep enjoying it"

They answer every single question I've asked and stayed with me for 2 hours to start me off. Just purely from my experience it defines that this game has a great community, now let's just take a look at other popular MMORPG games, WoW or Runescape, the community is simply toxic. Unlike this game...My ratingCommunity = 10/10Grinding = 10/10Releasing Dopamine = 10/10Atmosphere = 10/10Gameplay = 8/10There's only 1 world in PVE and PVP just like our old planet earth and only we can shape the world we wanted.Ever wondered what your life would be if you were living in a world without technology? well here it is! like an alternative dimension in the theory of quantum physics because it feels like we're living in a different dimension as there's only one world. Also, similar to our world resources could run out. EG if everyone is recklessly cutting trees without planting the seed back they could potentially be endangered because for certain trees you have to wait for a entire real time month for a full tree to grow back. There are also seasons which rotates every 2 weeks IRL time and actually plays a huge role in this game. For instance, during winter if you farm you would actually get less resource back because its cold and night would last significantly longer. (Vice versa for other seasons). Did I mention that I haven't even barely scratched the surface of this game?!#When a community unites, nothing is impossible...Now...

There are 2 servers you can choose from War and Peace. War is the PVP server and it supports conflicts, looting of players and the typical stuff.Peace is the PVE server and seems to be the best populated server.Both have awesome examples examples of complex building, and so far the crafting seems very involved and easy to do but with a realistic flair. Survival is also a primary concern for any player as you have to eat and drinks, and rest to keep full HP and energy. You can scavenge crafting resources and parts like saw blades or weapon parts, cloth, leather and whatnot. Food can be foraged ( edible berries and crop plants like carrots, etc... ) or fished for and gotten from animals you hunt. Food must be cooked over fires and you can farm crop plant from seed gotten thru extracting seeds from plants you forage.For the price, this game has way more to do than I think I'll be able to get to anytime soon. I joined a tribe and am role playing an american indian called RedEagle. The community is super helpful and always willing to lend a hand with gear and tips.I am telling all my friends about this really cool game!I would also suggest if you have this on your wish list, go ahead and take the chance  and buy it .. drop in and be prepared to enjoy this great Game!RedEagle"

It was around $30 at the time, and it was far worse than it was the first time I played.

I will update this review as I continue to work in the game.Simple question: ""Should I buy this game?""General answer: if you like sandbox free-to-do-as-you-please types, then yes.  It's worth the investment.  You can tell a lot of effort has been put into this game, though it's fairly underdeveloped.  The developer still seems actively involved in the community, but the community is lacking.  Nice people, just few of them on.  Expect to solo while you learn, and that's totally fine.This game is crafting heavy, but it takes a lot of time (and boring clicking and clicking and clicking) to get what you want done.  I mean a lot of time!  Not even so much that it's a lot of time, but that it's super slow-going, and very little instruction in-game, with a fairly generic tutorial.To have the best chance to start enjoying this game, I advise you make basket making your primary starting hobby.  This will help you get to the baskets you'll need to start developing resources without spending ten hours figuring out that you need to do this, and five more leveling it by farming grass and making thread and so on.  Once you have baskets, you're golden to start working the land.My advice further:  Safely navigate around the lake.  Find an area off the lake that has trees, rocks, and access to the lake.  Set up a tribe.  Start developing your totem area (aka learning your crafts).  Get to know the ten players in the game at any given time.  Eventually join their tribe just so you have something to build onto.  Or keep developing your own.By doing this, you will be in a safe zone for learning the basics.  You will be near a source of food (fishing), ability to develop tools and masonry, have baskets to store your stuff while you get started, and eventually be strong enough to get going on your own adventure or join up with others on a mmo adventure.Cons:  This game is still clunky.  Poor in-game tools.  Poor explanations.  Poor interface that is arduous and annoying.  Not intuitive at all.  But as you get the hang of it, it starts to make sense and works out.  But it's still clunky as all getout.  I imagine the developer is still trying to get this thing rolling, but it's been in dev for going on ten years.  Don't expect much.  Get it for what it is and play it accordingly.  It's worth that much.  Maybe by 2050, he will have it working as fluidly as minecraft."

So those of you out there bashing it remember it is a game that a lot of people lost interest in it because it was a pay to play and it no longer is. Most of the new eople I have seen playing it have been coming back to it quite often as I see them when I am online. It does not have a huge following like WOW but I think the game play is a lot better. you as players can set quests for people to do, you can build your own structures, you can manipulate the land under most circumstances. So while it may have a low following now, partially to still being in early access, I think this game will go far especially after it gets out of early release which the Dev has stated should be happening in the next month or two. As is it is a great game to play in my opinion, mindful that I a on the PVE server not the PVP server, so I cannot comment on that server as far as ow fun it is."

It's amazing to watch this barren wilderness being settled by a growing number of player tribes, everything from trading centers to small campsites. The game world is already quite large, so I can't wait to see what the full map holds when the game exits early access.Can't recommend it enough. Have some patience during your first few hours, take the time to familiarize yourself with the different skill options and crafting menus, join one of the many tribes who go above and beyond to help new players learn and settle in, the game will suck you in.EDIT: While I am still excited for the possibilities of this game's future, some of the initial enthusiasm has died down. The devs have been worryingly inactive in the steam community and xsyon forums. Exploring further in the game world has also let me see just how much the player base has lost some major players. there are several extremely large tribes that have control over huge areas off land, have built and terraformed massive settlements, and then vanished, leaving behind these ghost settlements. While it could be cool at first to see the ""ruins"" of a lost tribe, these areas are locking down large plots of land, making them unusable for active players. even more so, many of these old super-tribes were very destructive in the way they gathered resources, meaning there are less forests, valuable junk piles have been used up, and all these resources are just sitting on these old tribes' lands, useless. On the opposite end of the spectrum but equally annoying is all the random ""tribes"" scattered around that were created by 1 player who played for 1 day then quit. these lands are also unusable for active players, often having not a single thing built on them besides the tribe totem pole.I have read elsewhere that tribes are removed if they are inactive for over 3 months. this needs changing. this is far too generous for a single-person tribe, and is useless to help against the large old tribes, which may have 200+ members gone for a year or more, but 1 person keeps logging in, which means that tribe gets to keep all that land. players should be auto-kicked from their tribe if inactive, so that way the tribe will lose that extra land and be reduced to a size that matches the actual number of active members."

It's a lot like those old games where you had to do everthing for yourself, only it's even better than those since nothing can be bought from vendor npc's.This game does have a tutorial that will give you the basics, but you still have to do it all yourself.

The graphics were good, features were nice, and there was plenty of developers building this game up. This game had an actual fighting chance in the game industry when compared to others in its genre. It was known as Wurm Online 2. I even purchased the game when you had to buy it and pay a monthly subscription with it. Speaking of the payment model, many times the player base and myself talked about how the payment model was bad idea and how it can potentially kill the game or not allow it to get anywhere. I continued to play anyway because I liked the game’s ideas, the genre, and so on.What got me to quit was that I had a guide spawn hostile mobs near me and get me killed because of it, basically abusing their powers. When I confronted him, he said he didn’t do anything and just teleported away. I then afterwards got into an argument with the forum manager who was trying to censor my criticism of the game when providing feedback. At that point I just didn’t want anything to do with the game anymore. The game developer was alright, never seem to cause problems besides making overall poor choices when it came to staff hiring and the payment model.After a while the game went free to play using Wurm Online’s payment model where you had restrictions until you payed somehow, don’t remember exactly if it was a subscription or what. I gave it a try and little to nothing changed. Years after not playing, almost nothing changed, no amazing features, no mounts, no improved combat, just nothing exciting and worth playing. Now the game went to the payment model I wanted from the beginning and so I gave it a try. It’s still the same thing. No real changes, graphics are now outdated, and it appears there is only one developer on the game.At this point, there are two competitors, Wurm Unlimited and Life is Feudal: Your Own. This game just simply doesn’t stand a chance with them, where they’re fully staffed, have better graphics, are more stable, and have far more features. I wanted to like this game, I tried to do my part. The player base is tiny, because the developer made overall poor choices like having terrible staff and having a terrible payment model. The damage has been done, maybe the developer can dig himself out of the hole he’s in. I hope he does, but this game doesn’t appear to have a future. I hope I’m wrong, but I wouldn’t be surprised seeing this game die off soon enough."

It is a game to discover little by little, exploring, figuring out how the mechanics work, meeting people, having fun. I’m not a good review writer so let me show you some other players sentences describing Xsyon, which is my felling as well about this game:- If your a serious role player, you might of just found heaven. This game, in its current state, offers the most robust role-play mechanisms I have seen to date in a mmorpg. It is the definition of a good sandbox in the making for sure.-Tthis game is possibly the best sandbox ever created.- Been playing themepark mmo's the past 6 years or so, found this game and jumped the gun and haven't regret it any bit. This game is brilliant. Lots of fun to be had with a creative mind!- The videos don't really do the game justice IMO. The graphics are not that exciting to me. But the gameplay and the concepts are brilliant. Like the other guy said, its addicting as hell. I played the rift beta (and pre ordered) and enjoyed it. I played the Xsyon beta and was hooked almost immediately.-Looks like Freedom & Roleplaying is back in mmorpg's. Awesome.- I'm not worried, i think Xyson is already a breath of fresh air, once your in the world it lures you in with its charms.It's the little details like eating and drinking or wandering of to gather some resources so your friend can craft you that new backpack that make Xsyon shine and its these little details that the MMO giants always over look. It's been along time since a game has charmed me like Xyson has and that was Ultima over a decade ago.Xyson will appeal to the type of person who prefers that cup of coffee in that back street cafe or would rather walk that extra mile to buy from a small grocer rather than taking easy street for a cheaper, faster but ultimately inferior product from a big company.I personally love wandering in the snowy peeks exploring and then running for my life when a big grumpy bear decides i look tastier than the local fish... Xsyon has a great feeling of freedom, at no point have i found myself being pushed in any direction i didn't want to go in, i love it. :)- I'm liking this game more and more. It is really growing on me.- Xyson certainly seems to be bringing the RPG element back to MMOs!- The Building in this game is by far the very best I have seen in any game. Along with terraforming, it provides the right amount of freedom with the right amount of challenge.The simple fact that I can shape the land in a permanent way is a truly amazing accomplishment. Even though a few other games may provide something similar, this one beats them all hands down.Crafting is quite fun, and requires lots of different items, making the items made feel like an accomplishment. Well done.“For me, if we also had Zombies, and decay the game would be almost perfect...”When this last player opinion was made the game had not Zombies or decay system yet, now it is ingame Anyway I recommend this game if you are looking for a breath of fresh air."

Xsyon isnt for everyone. This isn't a mainstream game. It's a niche game. A free world, open ended sandbox. Not sandbox themed. You get what you put into the game. There is alot of ambiguity, and alot of hiden mechanics that even the veteran players don't know. The learning curve is steep. If you have ever played any large space-based mmo's before their tutorial systems, you know what a daunting learning curve that is. This is no short-termed end-game. Here is what my personal opinion of the game is:Pros:Open ended, there is no end.In depth crafting system.Sandbox, full customization of tribal areas.Very helpful player base, not alot of drama.PvE or PvP Server option.A VERY willing Developer who listens extremely close to their player base.Big ambitions for future expansions.Cons:Currently a low player populationSteep learning curveHard to solo in the gameSlower developmentWhile there are alot of reviews on the billing of the game, I am not fixated on subscriptions. It costs money to make a video game. Time = money. But to be a part of the metamorphasis of this game has beeen awesome. I have enjoyed this game solo and as a large tribe (guild). It is tough going solo unless you are near a larger tribe or willing to travel. That is what I ENJOYED as one of the challenges. The transparancy of development is a refreshing change and I truly feel the maturity level of the existing players is a welcome change. For those that are looking for the ""next best thing"", do your research. There are alot of apocalyptic games out there, this I would truly categorize as a survival game against the elements more than zombies, rogue bandits or space pirates. Watch your video clips, check out the wiki. I reccomend you overlook this game if you do not want to commit to a long-term game. If you want to be challenged, explore, and enjoy that liberating walk in the wilderness, then this game is definetly worth a try.There is alot of fixation on billing. Dropping cash on any steam game is a gamble. If you put that money on an impulse you will always have it, yet it just takes up space on your hard drive. Do you actually play those 200 games? I have put my focus on the actual game play. I see it as an investment, and as a player in this game I make damn sure that my investments into the development get heard. It's ultimately up to you.Frankly, I enjoy a polite, helpful global chat over epeen sword swinging egos boxing back and forth over who has the most testosterone. Steep learning curve? So what! That to me is part of the challenge. Experiment, ask questions, discover the game for yourself. You want this on a siver platter? Not going to happen. Solo play? Been there done that. I found spending time on the road to trade took too much of my time, but it was my choice to live in a place over 45 minutes real time walk from the nearest tribe to trade with.Again, this game is not for the elite players. This is a casual game, a challenging game, and one worth getting into if you enjoy something outside of the mainstream survival genre. I look forward to seeing you ingame."

The subscription fee is very reasonable and I prefer it to microtransactions.The people in Xsyon are friendly, helpful, and good company. After the first few crafting tutorials, crafting makes sense in a way it often doesn't in other games. The possiblilities are endless, expecially for building incredible elaborate camps and strongholds.I can't say how pleasant it is, after a hard RL day, to stand by Lake Tahoe fishing and watching the sunset.

You may or may not come to a conclusion about it within those 2 hours; I didn't.This review is based on a measly 4 hours of play. My normal ""likes"" are Fallout 4, 7 Days to Die, Empyrion:  open-world sandbox games with a strong creative/builder component.So I should love this game, right?In a nutshell, it just wasn't fun for me. As they say, ""your mileage may vary"".  I champion thegoalof the game, but the implementation just doesn't work for me.Yes, I read the reviews that cautioned that this game is Grindy^11, but I didn't fully appreciate that. You start with a 20-slot backpack, which is already about 2/3 full with the starter stuff, and which quickly fills. You see you have slots for other containers, but you don't generally get recipes for creating them. You have to (for example) level up your basketcraft by picking about a thousand pieces of grass (I don't think this is an exaggeration), and making grass thread, grass string, grass rope, etc. until you unlock the grass container recipe.I cannot emphasize enough how DULL that is. It sounds acceptable in the abstract, but it is pretty painful.Many other sandbox/builder games, like Empyrion and 7 Days to Die, have skill unlocks and prerequisites to be able to make better things; Xsyon is a whole 'nother plane of existence in that regard.The UI doesn't help in this (or any) regard: you'll regularly need 3-4 panels open at any time to accomplish anything. That grass you're collecting? You can only hold 4 bundles at a time, and you can't for some unimaginable reason transfer it to your backpack, so you have to stop every 4 bundles and craft something with it, which of course requires several panes to be open.I ultimately, uh, sad-quit because a humanoid NPC killed me and took my starting weapon and clothes. The clothes I can replace, after a fashion; the weapon would probably take me dozens of hours to make, or have enough cash to buy.I've been waiting a long time to get into one of these types of games (along with Life is Feudal and a few others on my watchlist); I was willing to take a chance on Xsyon since it was on sale. I regret my purchase.THE GOOD:On the PvE server (Peace), the community seemed friendly and helpful, if not small.The movement controls are pretty standard. The map (there's one for PvE and one for PvP) are huge, but everywhere I went seemed very rugged and mountainous (apparently based on the Lake Tahoe area).Let me add one final note: I can see why some people enjoy this game. Building a simple hut is a major accomplishment, and you feel you've accomplished a lot in doing so; I get that, I really do. But the journey is really, really long and tedious. If you want to follow that long road, and some subset of you folks WILL enjoy it, you have my admiration."

76561198004655782,Recommended,297470,16749143,"Posted: 27 June, 2015",all,Ichi,"I bought this game over a month ago and have not regretted making the purchase.  Please note that although my playtime record on steam is low (0.7 hours at the time of writing), it does not give a true reflection as I prefer to use the main Xsyon client - as do many other players.There are a couple of issues that I have noticed that have crept up on the forums.1) Subscription. Yes this game is a subscription based model. I know a lot feel its silly to charge a sub for this game. But actually having written in the official forums about possibilities of being free to play, the developer has actually tried testing out different pay models (including changing the sub fee). It was found that free to play created a destructive element in the game, in that it brought players who were not good for the game. Some of the players resorted to exploits, botted and even caused a lot of tension/drama in global chat by being rude/abusive (hence the reason why the majority talk in tribe chat and not global).The Cash shop idea. Wouldn't be good, Basically you are asking the developer to concentrate on making things for the cash shop rather than developing things for the game or patching bugs etc.2) It's Alpha. Well the developer has already commented on this. Basically it's on PRELUDE. So no, it not Alpha or Beta but the next step beyond that. I'm not paying to test a game. I am paying to play a game that is playable and published. Fact is that a majority of MMO's are never truly ""finished"" on release, hence why there are patches and expansions.3) Player numbers and community. Steam stats do not reflect true numbers. Majority of players still use the Xsyon client via the website as it was the default thing to do pre - steam. It's also a fact that a majority only speak in tribe chat. In the past a lot of drama was caused in global chat which became really problematic and had to be sorted out by GMs in game.The community overall is very mature and helpful. There are many vets who are happy to answer questions. Do understand though that timezone may affect peak hours for this game. I believe the majority of players are in the US/Canada timezones.Now onto the gameThe game tries to be as realistic as possible i.e. meaning you wont be able to kill bears until you have honed and got your skills really high. I believe people have high expectations from the get go and get disappointed because they cannot do the things they want to from the off. Sorry folks but this game is slower paced and longer longevity type gameplaying. Meaning be prepared to put in some hard work before expecting to be able to tackle some of the high end stuff.1) Crafting and resource gathering. Lot's to craft with many more crafting skills planned for the future.  You will need to either trade or gather resources to be able to craft. Be prepared to spend a lot of time gathering resources so you can grind your craft. Crafting and gathering also have a bonus in that each craft skill has a primary and secondary attributes. The more you use the skill, the more likely that the associated attribues with the skill will raise. For example, doing logging will increase your strength and agility. Making you a better fighter.2) Hunting and combat. Yes you can hunt stuff but you have to start off small i.e rats and chickens. You also need to locate them first before being able to kill them. After you kill critters, you can improve your hunting skills by skinning, gutting, decapitating etc. Don't expect to move up quickly as it will take a while to climb up the hunting ladder. There are also zombies called Revenants. Do not mistake these for players. If they kill you, they take your gear and use it. So for every critter that kills a player, they ""grow"" and increase in strength.3) Thirst and Hunger. Yes you have to manage these. You can fish, forage or farm for food to eat. For thirst you can drink from rivers or fill and carry a waterpouch with you. There is a balance though as overindulging will give you penalties. Become hungry or thirsty and you don't regenerate health and energy. You can die from prolonged thirst and hunger just like in real life.4) Health, Energy and Encumbrance. All of these can be improved as you keep grinding the associated skills. For instance grinding on a skill that increases your strength will help improve the amount you can carry and therefore your encumbrance levels.Health is self explanatory. When it reaches zero, your dead.Energy is basically like stamina. When you perform actions, it uses stamina. For example you can only sprint when you have more than 50% Energy. Once it reaches 50% or less, then you can no longer sprint, just light jog. When you run out of energy you have to rest or stop your action.Encumbrance levels is your carrying capacity. Basically if you are carrying a lot if items, it will be harder to run and uses more energy doing so. One of the ways to make this less of a problem is by using a cart to transport goods.Death has no real penalties at present.5) Tribes. I was lucky to find a nice tribe. Personally I think it's helpful to get into a tribe early on. You can solo but expect to work a lot more. Tribes give you an advantage in that they can give you tools and food so you do not have to worry about it and can concentrate on your skills. Also having someone to give you advice or answer your questions is nice to have. Also large scale building projects is very demanding and much more easier to complete within a tribe and fun too!Like I said I'm still having fun but it's not a game for everyone. The game requires patience and work before you see any progress  - just like in real life. People who have high expectations of being uber in the least amount of time and effort need not apply!I wish people would try the game and give it a chance before turning a blind eye to it. You never know, you might enjoy yourself."

Checking there forusm this is a bug they supposidly fixed a long time ago.   The overall graphics and feel of the game reminds me of the old game Vanguard, witht he same quality graphics and attempt at a zoneless game.   Now while admitally I couldn't got past the fact that it did all this in a forced small window, if the game uses the same engine as Vanguard, which it likely does.  Then it's not truely zoneless.   Vanguard relied on loading things as you approach a new one to make it look zoneless, as moving from one zone to aother mae it load and link it in the background.   This was greate before DSL and Cable, but since then your character could move faster then the game could link in a new one, making it pause to load the new zone you just walked in to.   Now as this game looks and feels exactly like the old Vanguard engine, I am betting it has the same issue.   Still all in all, not worth the price they ant for it currently."

I love the initial point of logging in and creating my character to buggily walking around and not doing anything at all. Hopefully in 20 years or so they finish it and completely change everything so it doesnt resemble runescape and other such up to date games. 10/10 would highly recommend so people can do literally nothing in game but run around and get the feeling that you are still on Windows 98!

Community is borderline abusive in their responses to people. Game doesn't appear to be interesting, and the gameworld lacks things to interact with if many people are not logged in. This is a particular problem since the gameworld doesn't seem to have very many players in general.I would not recommend this game in it's current state, it has some lovely concepts, but seems to lack any serious follow through on strength of features."

The stats are very slow to level so it gives you a lot of gameplay to invest into your character. I got this game 5 days ago and already put in 49 hours. lol.This game is Sub. once a month. Great game to play with sub though.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Pros -1. Large World, a lot of custimizing from cloths/armor to weapons.2. Create your own house, cabin, town, city, castle. whatever you can think of!3. Skills and a lot of em, from running, jumping and swimming to crafting skills like tailoring and leatherworking and MANY more!4. A lot of different types of monsters. Zombies, Bear and the Deer that will beat you up in a heartbeat!5. PvE server and PvP server!6. Tribes, like a guild you can join a tribe and then build a large base with your friends.7. They are STILL adding things to the game as we speak, i heard they are adding Bows and Arrows.8. Low population, giving you a lot free space to create a tribe and build.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Cons -1. Low Population making it hard to get help sometimes or to just chat with.2. I can get repetative, like if you have to get like 200+ limestone to make into Prepared Lime, collect tons more sand to turn the lime into Mortar.3. Some of the Crafting skills are hard to get started even with a little help.4. You can't exactly max all the skills.5. VERY large world, can get lost. Also when exploring and you die, it can take 5 minutes or hours to get back to were you was at.6. Still a few bugs to work out.7. This can be part of 6 actually but still, The game isn't new but it's still getting new features but that also means testing it. that creates bugs, yay, we all love those! he he"

I'd always chose a subscribtion based game over a free to play one, as free to play games usually are the greater rip-off if you really want to get into them. Almost all games i know of that are advertised for as being ""free"" turn out to be pay to win after a while. Here you buy the game, pay the monthly fee (you dont even have to do this if you dont mind the skillcap), and that's it.Keep in mind this is a sandbox, not a theme park. This game is what you make of it and strongly encourages team play. If you like grinding for skills and crafting, you can do it. If you like exploring and hunting, you can do it. It's also totally valid to just fish, farm and cook and never leave your homestead. It's totally up to you.You wont start with all off the games posibillities revealed to you, you have to work on your skills and talents to find out what you REALLY can do.Speaking of skills, what you do is what you get, chopping wood will get you logging skill, preparing meals will raise your cooking, clubbing rats will get your fighting skills up. On top of that you can spend some skillpoints rewarded for active gameplay to speed up the process. That's a brilliant concept to me.About limited character customization... that's just not true. There are so many different armor and cloth pieces you can wear, i dont even dare to guess a number, it's hundreds at least.This game is tagged 'Early Access' not for being new but for being in constant developement. It may not be what you expect from a 'Early Access' game, but this one at least is totally playable and enjoyable with a huge area to explore and countless options for crafting and building on two persistent servers. This isnt vaporware like all those other early access games that never leave alpha or are abandoned by the devs after a year or two.About the graphics: I cant stress how much i hate the korean manga style graphics of all the WoW copy games that are out there. This games graphics may not be state of the art, but at least it's very solid with the animations and environment and get's the job done pretty well.Oh, and no magic! No 300 different buttons for this spell and that buff, attack combo here and there and such nonsense. Buffs/debuffs come from food and environmental conditions. that's it. Very refreshing approach!Speaking of combat, it's non target free for all. Swing your weapon and make sure the stuff you want to hit is where the weapon is moving to. That's how combat is done!Not click a target, then have some keyboard macro spit out your favourite attack combo with fireballs and sparks and flashy things until the target is dead. Bleh...so TLDR, this is a special game for special people. love it or hate it, but for the correct reasons."

Originally I played on a laptop and I thought it just couldn't handle the graphics but even after I got a good gaming pc it still runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ I eventually concluded it was server lag and I don't have slow internet. I feel like Notorious games is cheaping out on the servers because this game doesn't have any long term cash flow. If you haven't played the game for a long time and don't have a group of 5+ friends the game will be very boring and all of the good spots to build are taken over. The worst problem with building is there doesn't seem to be any sort of decay, if someone builds a large base then quits the game and you want to build there 6 months later? well too bad you can't because they're IMMORTAL ♥♥♥♥ING WOOD SHACK IS THERE FOREVER!

So it take time to level up and to create items. You need to pay $14.99 month. But that is totaly worth it.If Xsyon get more players then this game have something that can be compeard to World of Warcraft.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I started without reading about the game and got some of my friends to start to. We are still learning the game and its a bit hard to find out how all the things work. The game have a PvP and a PvE server and we are playing on the PvE server atm. Its take some time to find out how to play the game but after a while its start to become alot more fun to play. I recomend to play with friends. Start a  tribe and make your own city. it take some time to do it but its alot of fun.

Real gamers don't want to hear this, but to have a clue what you are doing, just do the dang tutorial. But if you don't, and have to ask questions, most of the players I've come across are willing to help...on the PVE server that is. Yes, 2 Servers, PvP and PvE, so if you want to peacefully go out, and build your homestead, without worrying about that guy across the river taking your hard earned grass stack(grass, not weed) after he bonks you on the head, then you have a server to play on.About the gameplay, I myself find it to be very similar to WoW, but without the NPC's. Crafting it rather well thought out, and building has it's quirks at times, but it works, and it works well.I hunt for games like this, and like I have said, it's the best I've seen in a while.It is a big help that there are guides(admin) that DO help, run events, and keep you updated as to scheduled patches and updates. They tell you when new things are on the test server, so you KNOW, because other players go check, that new content is soon to be available.All in all, I give this game a 9/10. Few minor bugs that are irritating, but in no way take away from the fun."
