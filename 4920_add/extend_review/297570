,Recommended,297570,9930181,"Posted: 25 April, 2014",all,Mister_X,"It may not have been the prettiest child, even back when first released, But my word this was a brilliant game.one of the few RTS's where it feels truly free form in how you tackle each level. ( after the first couple of tutorial levels at least)Rarely a more satisfying gaming moment beats seeing your enemies sprawling base in uncontrollable flames.The only downside to this game is the annoying graphical glitching of the units, If anyone can solve that it would be much appreciated!Despite that, Its still very very playable.   I look forward to Warrior Kings : Battles joining it on here soon  ( I hope! )"

One of my favorite aspects is that there is a set of 5 religeous paths (3 distinct paths and 2 hybrids) that shape the course of the campaign based on the decisions that you make in game. The path that you follow also determines which specialty units and buildings you can build and each path has various advantages over the others. The AI players each also belong to a particular religeous group, adding new dynamics to each encounter.Great game, runs perfectly on Windows 7 x64, and supports 1920x1080 out of the box."

You will still have some random glitches on the more demanding levels but its reduces their number significantly and smoothes out the gameplay.As for the game itself its a gem that never got the acclaim it should have. Great story, great gameplay with many new ideas for its time including your choices changed the story and adding upkeep in order to maintain an army just like you would have to in real life.If your a fan of rts games this one is a must try just remember to fix the compatability issues before running the game and remember your troops will still glitch but if the compatability settings are right it will cause minimal problems."

So sadly I cannot recommend this game due to this fact, because it makes it unplayable.Don't waste £7 pounds of money. If you are going to buy it because of nostalgia, buy it when its cheap."
,Recommended,297570,29212221,Posted: 12 January,all,AdrienTD,"I mostly played the sequel Battles, which I enjoyed as a kid, but once I added money to Steam I instantly bought the first WK for only 99 cents!WK is a 3D RTS game a bit like Age of Empires and Warcraft. One notable thing is that there is onlyonerace (humans). All players begin the same, but then you can choose apathbetweenpagan, renaissance/technology and imperial. Also there is a more realistic and simple economic system with carts tranporting resources from village to village...The cool thing is that compared to the sequel there is acampaignwith atrue story, cinematics and dialogues. There are21 levels. Certain are short and easy, others are long and difficult. Having previously played Battles quite a lot, I finished all missions in about 30-45 hours.For people who haven't played both Warrior Kings and Warrior Kings Battles and who hesitate which one to buy, I would recommend Battles because it has less bugs, more unit types, an interactive tutorial (making the game easier to learn) and importantly a skirmish mode with AIs which the first WK does not have. It is also more popular and is preferred for multiplayer battles. But the first WK is still worth.Also I would like to mention that I've made some modding tools for Warrior Kings.

,Recommended,297570,11381963,"Posted: 23 July, 2014",all,Artibius,"PROS:+ cool campaign story+ various campaign paths+ building & unit tech trees+ unit formations make a difference+ battleground choice matters+ fun multiplayer+ flaming arrows!CONS:- clunky & outdated graphics- graphical glitches- some AI bugs- hard to set up a mulitplayer gameComment:Old gem in the RTS genre. Played it back in 2004 and 10 years later it's still fun. The branching paths of the campaign come each with their technology - pagan, renaissance or holy/imperial. You can commit to one path only or you can mix up renaissance with one of the other two. These missions unlock based on your choices in each level which I found really cool and interesting for an RTS. If you don't mind the graphical flaws and love various possibilities to conquer your foes with armies (or well-placed fire arrows, hehe) then this game is for you.------------------------------------------------------------------If you liked this review you can find more on theCurator pageor in myReview Corner."
,Recommended,297570,10090360,"Posted: 11 May, 2014",all,Vonebor,"I absolutely loved this game! I'm so glad that it's on steam now, since my old disk has been getting fairly scratched up over the years and it's nice to have a reliable copy.While the game's graphics have probably not aged very well for those not viewing it through nostalgia-tinted lens, it actually stands up fairly well still (native 1080p, anyone?). The strategy side is still rock solid as well, and it's implementation of formations and terrain remain uniquely excellent in my opinion. I know the old version had some stability issues, but I believe those have been addressed as of now.The single player story is definitely the selling point for this entry and I absolutely loved it's branching endings. No matter how many times I play it, every year or two I find myself putting it back in and booting it up to play through again! The multiplayer is kinda meh in this entry, but it's still serviceable if you'd only like to buy one out of the two. So for its excellent strategy, epic story and strong replayability, I couldn't recommend this game more highly!  Buy it already!"
,Recommended,297570,30202656,Posted: 26 February,all,Toomanypuppies,"Recommended for an older, slower paced RTS. One of my favorites from years back.Look up keyboard commands if you decide to play, as there are some (like increased speed - which makes the game progress more smoothly) that are a must have in my opinion.*****Buy this from GOG, the steam version suffers from a unit warping bug that often makes it unplayable. GOG version works great. My steam version is only good for launching the GOG game >_<*****"

76561198018868712,Recommended,297570,11406262,"Posted: 25 July, 2014",all,jbm4t,Its just so much fun.  The economy is great and somewhat unique.  The battles are tactical and reminiscent of total war series.  The econmy feeds into it well also giving good reasons to fight outside cities in the wide open maps.  The campaign is great.  The faction mechanics are really fun and stand out of the croud.  I'm not sure why this game didn't get better reviews (not that it was badly reviewed).I won't say its perfect.  Minimap and camera could be a bit better.  Keeping track of units can also be a bit annoying as its missing some selecting mechanics that would be in a newer modern game.Overall though its just so much fun and so compelling.I would give it a:9/10

You have three major factions, with 2 of them having two other sub factions all of which you get by how you tech. The storyline is great and what choices you make during the storyline will lead you different paths. Now for the sad part. I CANNOT recommend this game untill the graphical errors have been patched and this game is very buggy at times.Hopefully someone will work on a 3rd party patch to fix all of the issues, as this is an under rated game."

,Not Recommended,297570,20308788,"Posted: 4 January, 2016",all,Sutalffa,"Very slow and clunky. If you like RTS, pick up Age of Empires 2. If you like city builders, pick up Grand Ages: Rome. If you like dynasty builders, pick up Crusader Kings. Stronghold might satisfy you if you're looking for a similar strategic mix. I'd actually suggest Majesty if you're willing to roleplay a little more and strategize a little less.The game doesn't even have a singleplayer skirmish mode either, and everyone who plays multiplayer seems to have WK:Battles which supposedly has this plus more content but requires a direct network connection. It reminds you of playing C&C from the old days where you could only choose among previously completed missions, or had to directly connect through a serial modem connectionGames that use middle mouse buttons for rotating the camera and don't have custom controls are just asking for trouble. There's no windowed mode either. :-\"

Great story and great gameplay, I liked the part how you can chose your path as there is 3 main ones and 2 hybrids. if you want a stable game that is mostly the same  get Warrior Kings Battles it doesn't have a main story mode it has a conquest mode and a skrimish mode, other wise its a great game."
