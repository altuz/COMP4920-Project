Maybe you have to have made a special kind of experience to aknowledge and value the metaphor that is being told. It is an extremely deep, meaningful gaming experience, that transports an important message to all workaholics and career-fetishists. Additionally it is filled with humour, witty comments, smart cross-references to pop-culture and the gaming industry.If you like intellectual & philosophically challenging games like Ether One or Mindpath To Thalamus you definitly should give this title a try. Explore the details. Enjoy the weirdness. Wait for the mind ♥♥♥♥.I highly recommend this title, although I fear that not many gamers will have the patience to experience the whole master piece (which is a pity). Thank you Phosphor Games for an utterly interesting game! I hope that you took the moral of your game to your heart during the development of this title itself ;)"

Maybe I Should start with the bad things fisrt.So I had two cons about this gameOne, the optimization, Oh lord, the optimization is poor. My frame rate was terrible and I had to have my settings set to low the entire time, and I STILL had crap frames. It was terrible, but I paid the 15 dollars for it so, at first, I thought, ok lets just push through that and see what the game has to offer gameplay wise.My second and only other gripe with the game was that I would occasionally glitch through the floor when I would jump, so nothing to out of the ordinary there.As for the Pros, Well...The first time you wake up you're on your ship. Its a pretty self sustained looking palce....but you've just crash landed due to some unseen force, so the automated messages play thoughout the ship and have you walk through for your mission breifing. after that, once those doors open, things get weird, The good kind of weird. Throughout the first half of the first planet you're on, this robot, the AVA if I remember correctly, walks you through your mission, which is placing becons on the planet to map it out while she calls for a distress signal. once you place the becons down, she says she can not find a signal and tells you that you will die alone. She then loses all he battery power and drops to the dirt, lifeless. and now you're all alone right?.....Right?The events that happen after wards? well, you need to play this yourself if you can, because I woulnd't want to spoil it for you. Is it worth 15 buckaroos? I would wait for it to go on sale, maybe catch it at 10 or hell, I bought this at 10% off and  Idont regret it. If you got the money to spend, I would recommend getting this and playing it through. From what I could tell, it controls nice, the story is incredibly amazing and as of this review, it leaves me wondering what happens next.Oh, and if there just so happens to be a content creator (""youtuber"") out there reading this. I think It would make for some pretty decent content."

Sort of similar to Lifeless Planet in this regard. However, unlike Lifeless Planet, this game just kind of droned on. It took me a little less than three hours to complete, and I really wish it had taken about half that. It became a very boring affair going out to basically do the same things over and over with minor changes to your base in between. That actually kind of killed the immersion for me.As far as the actual gameplay, it was pretty smooth. It's an exploration game, so you really just move about, jumping and when available, using your jetpack to navigate alien planets. You will interact with your objectives, but mostly you just take in the visuals and listen to what also seemed like overly long dialogue.Now, I dont want to pan this too hard because it is evident that this game was a labor of love, and it definitely had its positives, but overall, I just ended up finding myself bored. The pacing never changes throughout. Just sort of you wandering at what amounts to a casual pace with, as mentioned before, somewhat droning dialogue.I'd say it is worth checking out when you dont have anything else you'd like to play or simply want an interlude between other games, but I'd also bet you will end up feeling bored like I did.5 out of 10 for me personally. I'm giving it a no as a recommendation because, like I say, it ends up just being boring."

Incoherent story and sluggish movement mean that isolated well-executed vignettes (sarcastic AVA and planet of the pillars) can't save this walking simulator.Feels wrong not to mention the horrific, game-breaking pop-in: platforming segments and even general exploration are almost impossible when you cannot see the ground around you."
,Recommended,297720,22258495,"Posted: 5 April, 2016",all,(-C-)Fjonan,"I'd call it a narrative experiment that takes inspirations by recent science-fiction movies like ""Moon"" or ""Interstellar"" with a more passive ""walking simulator"" approach with a good amount of platforming in the mix when moving around. I loved what it tries story wise even if it in my opinion lacks a good amount of polish which I think stems from the small team that really tried to get a lot in. But that is also one of the main problems I had with the game: it could have been half as long. Getting from one objective to the other gets tedious and does not further the feeling of loneliness but being in a game ticking boxes. It pains me to think that so much energy was used to make the game larger, when the opposite would have made it that much more focused.But even with all it shortcomings I can appreciate the core concept of what it is trying to convey. It touches on many topics, some on the sidelines, some major (the holo-messages were relly moving) and it shines through that the game is trying more than it ultimately can handle. I would love to read some interpretations on the story in the forums (which I will not mention here because of spoilers) and I want the developers to keep going in this direction and get better at it, because this kind of game is still uncommon and I like it for it.If you like new experiences in games and if you have no problems with an indie diamond-in-the-rough I reccomend taking a look. This, for me, is an example that shows that games can be much more than mere mechanics tied together by a cheesy story you don't care about."

(One of the Game Designer's family plays the family of the protagonist in game)  I beat the game in right about 5 hours. No crashes or glitches. My wife watched me play and she and I both really felt the emotional impact moments from the game. I thought there were spots for some achievements, but maybe not many. The game starts out as a straightforward mystery, and then takes a turn to the surreal. This is more of a game to inspire contemplation rather than wrap everything up nicely. Most of the progression on the mystery is done via optional objectives, and if you don't do them you will be totally lost at the end. If you do all of the optional objectives the message of the game is deceptively easy to understand and only obfuscated by the preconceptions that you bring. Good game. Surreal ending, but good game."

I got it because I thought it looked cool and I wanted to play something a little bit more cerebral and contemplative. But, boy, I wasn't prepared for this. Maybe it's because of my own situation in life, but this game resonated with me in a way that only very few games have. It's a wonderful literary experience, accompanied by a beautiful soundtrack, a very distinct art style and a writing that has its own personality, much like games by The Chinese Room.

I was really excited for the first 15 minutes when I saw the impressive graphics of the living quarters. Then less and less excitement until I completed the game in about 3 hours feeling like I wasted time and money. I am fond of short games like Dear Ester, or To the Moon as long as they are thoughtful, rich and interesting. Corpse of Discovery isn't anything like that, however.The dialog is very contrived, cliche, and forced, nearly to the point of being irritating. Whoever wrote the dialog in this game I am pretty sure knew this because the game even teases you about its own repetitiveness. It almost feels like the game has gotten bored of itself.The gameplay mechanics consist of running and long jumping to points on the display. There are some floaty wrath creature things that do nothing but interfere with the running to the objective. On one level there is a radiation that drains your radiation bar if you're exposed in the sun too long.I'm going to end this review half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and lazy just like this game's ending. Take the few hours and watch a movie like Interstellar, Solaris, or Sunshine instead of bothering with this game."
,Recommended,297720,19070643,"Posted: 14 November, 2015",all,markzwaan,"When 'Lifeless Planet' was anounced about a year ago I was very excited. Exploring an alien planet in a realistic setting sounded like a great premise. Unfortunately the game turned out to be a platformer with a largely empty environments. I also experienced a game breaking bug about 90% through which meant I couldn't finish it.Corpse of Discovery delivers where Lifeless Planet failed. Its environments are much larger and more interesting and the exploring is about discovery and not about quick, carefully timed jumps from platform to platform. It's story is completely different and for a long time I was left wondering in which direction it would go. The graphics aren't perfect (many tufts of grass hovering in mid air in some levels) but I haven't experienced any significant slow downs and the game never crashed.The premise of the game is that you are an astronaut who wakes up in a research lab on an alien planet. Your shuttle has crashed and the chances of you surviving are slim. After watching a message from your family you get your assignment and head out of the airlock. After completing your objective everything turns to black and you awake in the same room. This happens again and again. Is it all a dream, is this a virtual experience, is it a psychological test of the CoD or is there something else going on entirely? Much is left up to you, the player, to figure out which might not be everyones cup of tea. But at about three hours of play time it never drags on and I quite enjoyed it. If you can get it on a discount you won't be disappointed."

,Recommended,297720,22626176,"Posted: 25 April, 2016",all,Emperor Emblem,"This is an interesting walking sim with some platforming elements. The game intially grabs the player quite well thanks to its Groundhog's Day/All You Need is Kill vibe that it starts out with, and its rather depressing narrative keeps the player at least somewhat interested as to what exactly is going on with the player character.Sadly the game lacks innovation in its own mechanics, and the narrative, although interesting, isn't really directly present until the last two sections of the game. During the time between the initial grab at the player attention and the entertaining, albeit sad conclusion, there is very little keeping the player going outside of the hope for answers. The world building present throughout the game is kept rather minimal, whether this was to keep the narrative as the focus and allow for theorizing, or just lazy game design is up to the player to decide.All in all I'd have to say that the game is interesting enough for me to validate a $5 purchase (the price which I originally bought the game at), but it's best to keep in mind that there is next to no replayability unless you are some kind of theorist fanatic or have a friend sit down and play it while you look for their thoughts and reactions.TL;DRThe game is worth a $5 purchase for those looking for a short (approximately 3 hour) walking sim with an interesting, albeit depressing narrative, and aren't looking for games with replayability in mind.I give it a weird black creature/an entertaining AI Dialogue."

I was not disappointed and really enjoyed the experience this game offered.I did have a few performance issues however, the game frequently dropped below 60FPS and had really bad pop up and I run a 980 titan, a game of this visual fidelity should not run this poorly, I should be able to expect a consistant 144fps. Also the mouse kept randomly changing sensitivity, I generally play 30cm/360 but sometimes after a load or objective change my sensitivity would go up to 5cm/360 oe any random number between which was very frustrating. That been said though, this is a narrative experiance and not an Arenafps so these small frustrations should not stop you from enjoying the wonderful experience this game offers.p.s.

I mark those as both things the game does well.Unfortunately we get into the things the game does not do so well. (Note: the following do not apply to the game's final level I will have a seperate point about that.)* Transversing the various worlds.- I like that each world has its own theme and what not but they get so vast that it quickly becomes an exceedingly boring platformer that boils down to ""go hear using the tool this level gave you"" I think the worst part is the levels were just made too large for the number of them the game tries to fit and they end up being very bland.* The bonus objectives - The bonus objectives more often than not would frankly not be worth the time it would take to reach them. Most of the time you would get a tiny item of day to day life from the MC's past that would not be visible to the AVA unit traveling with you. Now while a little homesick delusion adds a nice surreal touch that I do approve of I found these to just not be worth the sometimes several minutes of detour to reach them. HOWEVER every now and then one of the bonus items would be something completely off the wall and insane such as the Chris Rock rock. Items as crazy as that were definately worth the extra journey and I cite them as an example of something unexpected the game does well.*The AVA unit that tags around through your levels. The design and voice acting on the unit are excellent however with the exception of the final level this too became bland and repetitive as the character was never really noticably different from one level to the next. I felt that if the AVA unit had some transformation of personality similar to the way the MC's personality changes from level to level this would have been a large improvement.TLDR: The game has a good premise and a solid control scheme but suffers from blandness.Now onto the game's greatest aspect... its FINAL level!The final level of the game. The final level was... an astonishment. By this point the blandness of the past few levels (ESPECIALLY the Molten World level) had pushed me to a point where I just wanted the game to end as soon as possible, the Chris Rock rock was amazing but points of that quality were too few and TOO far between. Then came the last level. The last level was like a merciful breath of air after drowning in dullness. The last level is VASTLY superior to the rest of the game. It still has a bland world you are moving through HOWEVER you do not notice as the goals are so rewarding. The AVA unit gets ALL the personality it could have had over the course of the game in this one level and is highly entertaining. The points you travel to in the last level go from mundane to insane in an amazing way. The last level is the journey from normal to surreal that I wanted to experiance over the course of the whole game, packed into one level. The final level is the reason I chose to write the review for this game. It was almost worth slogging through the previous bland dragging parts of the game JUST for the pleasure of going through the last level.TLDR: The last level is the journey from normal to surreal, as the MC slips into madness, that I wanted from this game all along. It is the game's greatest redeeming feature.The last level proves that this developer has potential and I would look forward to their future work once they refine that potential. However I cannot recommend this game just on the last level."

I got this for two dollars, and having played it I think it's a fair price for at least five.My favorite part of this game is just the exploration, travelling through unknown planets that look awesome yet have very real dangers. It was super immersive......that is when it worked. I had a handful of frustrating moments when I would clip through the floor to my death or get caught in a graphics hole. When I play these games though I understand how difficult it is for a small team to program a 3D game like this, and that you just have to accept glitches like that.The story was interesting enough to keep me going to find out what happens nexts but it was just underwhelming. The game beats you over the the head with the ""REMEMBER YOUR FAMILY!?!?!"" shtick in a very ham-fisted fashion. The voice acting from all the family members was poor and unbelievable. Also I'm ninety percent sure that the plot of this game was doing that "" I'm purposely vague and abstract so I can pretend I'm being profound and meaningful"" sort of thing. I realized halfway that all these weird plot points I was finding were just pointless BS, and it was pretty disappointing. Was the astronaut dead the whole time? Was he picked up and died in a hospital later? Was he just stranded on the planet? Is this all just a dream or a coma fantasy? Who knows, I don't even think the devs did tbh.A.V.A., your robot companion, was a fantastic character though. Watching her slowly change over each sequence was really awesome. Her dialogue, while not really having a point a lot of the time, was meaninful in characterizing her as a sentient being going through an existential crisis.So if you like jumping around weird abstract planets in low gravity with  jetpack, you should buy this game. Just don't go into it expecting a deep plot or any sort of clarification or closure on what's going on."

76561198007273600,Recommended,297720,18223017,"Posted: 27 September, 2015",all,Syt1976,"SPOILER FREEIntroI picked this up based on Jesse Cox's video on it - it was an intriguing premise and I was very curious to see what was going on within the game's story.As it states in the game's News/Updates, this isn't a game for everyone. It's an interactive story, a narrative museum or, as the common term these days is, a ""walking simulator,"" in that its focus is on story and creating a certain atmosphere to create a narrative experience with limited gameplay mechanics. That said, the game has a few (easy) jumping puzzles, and a few times I had to spend some time figuring out the path to my next objective. If this isn't something you like, then skip it.If you enjoy games of this type and a sci-fi plot and alien worlds, then you may want to give this a look.Graphics/Controls/PresentationAs said, the gameplay mechanics are relatively simple. Walking, sprinting, interacting. Later on you will also make use of a jetpack. The controls were absolutely fine. I'm not a twitch gamer and I managed fine.The game's design is very neat, with lots of detail in your little home base (most of it not interactive). The alien worlds are also each unique in their own way and offer a variety of different environments. Each planet seems very large, though I'm uncertain if there's much point to deviating from your objectives too much.The graphics quality was good on my GTX770Ti. On planets you will find that there's many decorative objects through which you can clip, and some through which you don't - you will learn which is which. Occasionally walls glitch a bit. Unfortunately, there's a fair amount of environmental pop in and even at maximum the view distance seemed a bit short, and on a few occasions I was left wondering if a certain direction would be navigable because I couldn't see if there would be solid ground, a cliff, a ramp etc. I think I would have preferred some fog to obscure the pop in, and perhaps low res models for far off environments to make navigation easier.Story and Game PlayThe game sets up an intriguing mystery within the first half hour that drew me in rather effectively and provided the motivation to continue playing. While progressing I spun several theories in my head as to where the story was leading. However, I found that by mid-game it was pretty clear, despite a few doubts in the back of my brain.Most of the gameplay has you chasing objectives on the planet surface, having to figure out how to get there and avoiding obstacles. You can die, but the consequences aren't severe. When you get a new objective, always check if there's a ""secondary"" in your HUD and check that one, too, to get the full story. Unfortunately, after the original WTF-factor of some of the things you encounter, some of the things you see will become a bit mundane.The voice acting was a very nice touch, and in the last chapter I had quite a few laughs. The main character is silent except for on screen text. Some of the text disappears quickly, and sometimes it's so long it obscures a fair part of the screen. I wish there had been a different solution for this. Your little companion drone AVA is fairly fleshed out and undergoes her own little character arc.The game is fairly introspective and in a few ways hit close to home for me. The resolution was IMHO slightly weak. I obviously don't want to spoilt it, but I was more left wondering, how the end would be presented and not what would happen. In hindsight the game functions as a parabel on ... a few topics; again no spoilers.Final ThoughtsI finished the game in 5 hours. As with most games in its genre there's little replay value, unless you want to see if you missed any secondary objectives. €15.- may seem a bit steep for that. I don't regret the purchase (it's cheaper than going to the movies), but I can see why people interested in this game may want to wait for a sale."

The story lays out a lot of possible threads but never follows up on most. There is also a religious versus scientific thread that comes off as more lecture than debate, as if it was included just to expound on the writer's views. Side objectives are meant to expand on the story but most give you information already heard through the messages from home. No steam achievements makes finding them completely not worth the effort.Your (voiced) companion AI and the music were easily the best part of this game, both are fantastic and make the journey worth taking. Another great addition was the gradual platforming that found it's way into the gameplay, making it less of a 'walking simulator' and more of an actual game. The jetpack physics are well designed and an enjoyable way to get around.With such a strong start, I was hoping for a really great ending or a good twist. Something like Moon with Sam Rockwell or Oblivion with Tom Cruise. Unfortunately, what we get is a family message and a childish lullaby. Despite requiring only 4 hours to complete (some side objectives), I felt it dragged on for the last two missions and could have been summed up sooner. Had the story been stronger, this wouldn't have been a problem.My personal taste in storytelling is responsible for what I primarily didn't like about the game and despite that I can easily recommend it.

The game, quality explodes my expectations, when first launching the game you get an eerie feeling that whatever happens  when you decide to hit the new game words, displayed on the menu. It's going to be a first person narrative story! Oh I wonder How I knew that?When first entering the mind of an astronaut that had just momentarily awakened. The environment around you appears to be a base of some sort. I hadn't been certain whether I was on aboard a ship,  land base maybe? upon further expectation you discover in first person objects around your bedroom that relates to the time you had spent on earth, now in control of a character who is nameless as far as I can tell? You begin to walk around the exterior, doors will separate you from other rooms. I won’t go into detail as what is in each room, but I do suggest you re observe everything you’ve already interacted with as you progress this solemn tale.Through the story you’l find your self traversing planets with epic environments that range from a desert, flora and fauna filled, and some with life forms of all kinds yet to be named, as well discovered. I never found myself being bored once I began to explore a planet.  A little circle bot will accompany you for every planet you are on, giving you reassurance of the terrific work your performing, that few humans will ever carry the likeliness that you will one day bring back to earth. The bot itself also records data of you and the planet you are on, eventually relaying the information back to the company you work for. I don’t want to get into details for the story, I will say it’s easily the strongest trait for this particular title.Plat forming, a huge part in Corpse of Discovery, you’ll find yourself avoiding and planning routes ahead as some objectives require you to travel to high mountain areas that at first look impossible to explore till your actually at the base of the it. Your given a small jet pack like boost to help you plan your jumps accordingly. Again I don’t want to spoil anything for you, but there will be moments where your deciding how your going to go about this planet, just by looking ahead of you. I’ll argue that’s about as game play as it gets, some planets offer different resistances of gravity, allowing you to enjoy some higher jumps, which can be satisfying as you’ll notice for various reasons I can’t go into.You find yourself accompanied by much dialog, as well many different types of “feeling” music, is the only way I can think of how to describe that right now. Some of it evokes feeling that make you feel like your an alien on another planet, horror, sadness, anger, so much is great with this sound track, if I had to complain about one factor I had noticed with my play through, that periodically the music would cut off without reason destroying some of the immersion I had settled in myself at that point. Now that im on that topic, you as a player of discovery, will notice some glitches. I found nothing game breaking, but they are there, I hope you don’t find anything, but be forewarned!I wish I had more to say, but really you should just buy this game, it’s slow, plays with your emotions, and delivers a fantastic ending that will spin your head around for the next couple of hours. I hope these dev’s keep up the quality they delivered in this walking, jumping discovery game, which I always recommend to people around me.

However, if you allow yourself to play along, then it shouldn't bother you too much, and you'll get to see some cool set-pieces as well.=====As of writing this, optimization still isn't quite up to snuff, and you'll most likely run into some stuttering issues every now and then, but it's noticeably improved since release.=====The story itself is pretty interesting throughout, but takes a bit of a predictable route towards the end. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I personally felt like the ending could have been much more than what it was.=====Controls were easy to use and understand, and the jet-pack you get three levels in makes traversal of the map a high point of the game. Which is good, since you'll be spending a lot of time going from point A to point B.Overall, Corpse of Discovery is an interesting game, and I'm glad I played it, but I'm pretty easy to please. It's a decent story, written in a messy hand."

I bought this game under the illusion that the gameplay would involve more than hopping toward arrows on a map and was sorely disappointed."

It's hard to explain without giving it away, but I feel, if you enjoy exploration (not in the usual sense) you should play this. It's worth the price and time to play. Took me about 3 hours, more if you hunt for the extra bits.The game has a way of digging under your skin and making you just want to get to the end but it's a part of the story. I felt like it was a really good book, with it's ups and downs, it's foreshadowing and the climax with a nice resolution.Also, it's mostly 3D platforming. So, if you don't like that, I wouldn't suggest it."

Im not sure what to think, but it really drives home the point that family is all that matters. I have never thought that any job or lifestyle in the world should replace that, and the narrative slowly show it. I would recommend it for any casual genre fan, but if you arent one to pay too close attention to detail in games, you may not appreciate it quite like I did."

The horror game from Frictional Games that involves lots of walking from A to B while ocassionally listening (and conversing with, in Soma anyway) with a female A.I. who is also the driving force behind your objectives. As you try to reach these objectives, you will encounter monsters (I'm not very comfortable calling them monsters in either game) that may hinder you in making immediate progress.The dividing line between these two games is that Corpse of Discovery is made on a budget, while Soma has a triple-A polish fitting any effort by giants like EA or Ubisoft. When I say that Corpse of Discovery is made on a budget, I mean it looks like a decent 360 title circa 2008-2010 but with some added annoyances. Some of the flora you'll encounter in the game, as solid as they might seem, can be clipped through. Same goes for ankle/knee high-ish rocks. This is a bit frustrating as it gives the game an air of being unfinished, though not gamebreaking.In terms of setting, story, and gameplay, the game excels in the two former and does precisely what it should do with the latter. Being a walking simulator, by default the game sports somewhat rudimentary mechanics; you walk, sprint, jump, and activate stuff and that is it. Setting is... everchanging and has some fantastical imagery to show you. Story is also very interesting and plays around with family as a theme, which is a direct contrast to what the game is. It's interesting to say the least.If you can ignore the graphical and technical shortcomings of the game, Corpse of Discovery is an engrossing sci-fi adventure that sucks you in and demands your attention. Being relatively cheap is also plus for the game, so that is worth keeping in mind. All in all, I cannot recommend Corpse of Discovery enough, even despite its budgetary limitations."

That may be the point but quickly got me to the point where their apparent lack of such internal logic or explainability made me stop caring about them.Overall I can truly recommend this game. My playthrough took not quite 4 hours in total and was a fun time.The closts game to this in general tone I can think of (for reference) would be ""lifeless planet"".This game is not as polished as that, but stil presents quite a bit of the same explorational feel."

The environments are strange and varied enough. Some of the odd things you find along the way are amusing. Most of the voiceacting is quite good. All in all this is a decent title. I'm not blown away by it, but it held my interest pretty well for the amount of time it took to complete it."
76561198087530744,Recommended,297720,26004740,"Posted: 12 October, 2016",all,Macedonica,"Corpse of Discovery is a game which sees you re-awaken time and again as an astronaut/explorer aided by an EVA unit and tasked to mark or discover various items. Each time you wake up things have shifted and your environment has changed. EVA is droll and satirical in her attempts to motivate you. It is on one level a surreal moebius loop and on another a dark dystopian nightmare.In terms of gameplay, this is nothing more than travelling to locations on each new planet and interacting with each find at that location. This is spiced up with the addition of a jet pack and platforming elements which bring in a nice verticality to the usual 'walking simulator' mechanic. Let me say, that the planet environments are gorgeous in a No Man Sky style (although this games obviously predates that 'game'). It is a joy to jet-pack through some of the later planets.Simple game-play aside, Corpse of Discovery unsettles you as the loops unravel and unwind and a darker narrative emerges. Satire and absurdity combine with chilling mood music and the lovely droll tones of EVA's voice to really unsettle you. As for the ending - as with all good philisophical sci-fi, it leaves you adrift a little and throws the meaning into your own hands.This worked for me - others will find it simplistic or perhaps a cop-out. I enjoyed this game - especially after the decale of NMS. Yes, it is short but in terms of mood and atmosphere, it works."

Beautiful graphics, nice music, touching story with good voice acting and a bit of humor. The amount of challenge is just right and jetpacking feels good - which is an achievement. No technical issues in my experience. One thing that was a little unexpected is that the game is quite demanding - a card like the R9 380 is barely enough for high settings. Overall, very pleasant experience."

It starts out intresting as a sci-fi mystery you wake up from a black out you arnt sure how you made it back to base and are told the same thing go do this for us your family will be set for life from your contribution the little bot that follows you just keeps hammering that in ,and then all of sudden ur doing shoddy platforming and repetitive game play of go find this.. I will agree with others it does look good and the story does start out intresting forsure but then it gets repitive real quick ..I would not pay full price for this i got it on the steam summer sale if you really are into sci-fi exploration ,walking sim/werid platforming then try it out when its on sale"
