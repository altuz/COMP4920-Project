,Recommended,297750,14345614,"Posted: 5 February, 2015",all,Seb,"A more up-to-date version of the CC classics.I will edit this review later, but first off I want to say something immediately.I see people claiming to be CC ""fans"", give it thumbs down, and post stuff like ""you can't pause the game"".Guess what, you can.. just hit the ""pause"" key on your keyboard. Now, that wasn't so hard, was it? And if you truly had played any of the predecessors, you'd realize that this version works just in the exact same way.By the way, you can press spacebar to activate range info (I have command influence range as standard). There's a comprehensive list of keybindings in the manual.Now, off to the game. CC is a top down, real-time action WWII strategy game, with roots as far back as 1996. CC is legendary for those beknownst to it. It continues the style of a few other games in the series with a grand-campaign-style strategic map. This strategic map will progress on a turn basis, with battles occuring after a movement phase. Battles will take place one by one, where two battlegroups clash on the grand map. Available at some points on the strategic map are also air support and artillery (to inderdict). When you battle, you will get loaded onto the proper map for the region you're in on the Strategic map, and the real-time action starts. The battles are realistic and intricate, with morale, cover, angle of attack, suppression, ammunition and range all being important factors to the outcome.Of course, you can scale the difficulty yourself, do skirmishes instead of a grand campaign, and set up your own battles, or even campaign if I recall correctly. Last time I checked there was also a functional multiplayer. And I guess this would be really fun to play with (against) friends.As for the price, I had to get it, not nescessarily because it's fairly priced (although I don't find it that steep) but because I want to support the making of anything CC, since the series are one of the few classics that stand out with great quality, which in my opinion should get all the support it could get. We have enough throwaway games today published by companies that care for nothing but money, with employees that have no passion for it whatsoever."

One is the price! its utterly ridiculous and greedy by the developers they haven’t added nearly enough in the way of improvements or balancing to the game to warrant that price tag. This isn’t a HD remake or anything to that regard its just the same game engine  with the same ai and a few tweaks.  The Second is the games lack of support after launch. Where’s the patches? Literally where’s any attempt to improve the game or fix some of hit detection issues or ai bugs. The game has a terrible UI it really does , its so awkward you have to learn a fair few hotkeys to get anything done. I want to like this game more I really do its something so different and simulation esc but at the same time I cant stand the lack of support after release instead relying on fans to make the patches?

I am severly disappointed about #1 The Opening Graphics (I feel like I am going back to 1991 when I first CHOOSE my mission). #2 The movement of troops and tanks are ABSOLUTELY horrible. #3 You are no longer able to change specific Units like you were able to in the past 2 Close Combats (granted this gives it more historical basis but when you are the Nazi's it is almost a sure loss.) There are more errors in this game than what I have reported, but this is what I have seen in the reviews that not many people/nobody has brought up.

Around the time of Close Combat 4 the map size reached a point where the AI began to act odd. This was because the AI was never really adapted for the now giant high resolution maps. The result was they began to cluster in one corner, essentially covering an area that was once the size of an entire map but is now just a small part of one large map. This was not fixed in 5. It was not fixed in remake of CC 3 or the remake of CC 2. It is not fixed in this one.A great game in multiplayer where the AI is not an issue but basically broken for singleplayer."

,Recommended,297750,17485788,"Posted: 11 August, 2015",all,Lord Cucumber,"Close Combat: Gateway to Caen is an excellent Close Combat game that details Operation Epsom, a British plan to flank German positions at Caen to basically create a short cut into the city, whilst at the same time taking down German defenders at the Odon river. Historically, it was a costly battle for both Axis and Allies, and technically the Allies won, as German defenders committed all of their armour to close the gap, essentially wasting their fuel and vehicles on re-establishing their positions on the river Odon after the initial British attack. The British, as said, paid a high price, as they were up against veteran armour 'fresh' from the eastern front, that chewed up British armour like nothing else. The battle could have gone either way, and so the 'what if' factor is perfect for a game where you can play both sides.Gateway to Caen takes some getting used to if you are a veteran of the CC series. Unit scale is back to somewhat smaller, and unit choices per battle when playing the grand campaign are somewhat more limited. This is by no means a bad thing as you are finally forced to truely consider what you field when. When playing the campaign, as troops grow tired you HAVE to rotate them out every so many battles, or they eventually panic/surrender, no matter what their quality.Units included in the game are, amongst others, 2nd & 12th SS Panzer ('Das Reich'& the infamous 'Hitlerjugend' fanatics), The Royal Scots Fusiliers, the 46th Highland infantry brigade, 9th RTR and 43rd Wessex Infantry division.The main campaign is pretty well balanced: Generally speaking the British forces outnumber the Germans with what they can field at any given time, but the Germans often outgun the British with their heavy armour and 88mm Flak batteries. German troops do consist mainly of 'ad hoc' defenders initially, making for a pretty steep start when playing Germans, despite the prepared positions and the big guns.On my YouTube channel, I dedicated a series to this game, playing the main campaign as the Germans, check it out here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtW8YlPecNk&list=PLXIwxNbJRA-D0JflIFLCp0u90eTR0oDrx&index=1I recommend this game to anyone interested in World War 2 gaming and the Close Combat series in general."

Incremental improvements in cosmetics have only served to cover the significant failings of the game. Issues which were complained of long and hard by the fan base a decade ago continue to collect under the increasing undulations of the Slitherine rug:Path finding resides in the domain of a game of blind mans bluff.

Frequently regarding enemy LOS (Line of Sight) much as a moth regards a light source;The AI displays a form of paralysis, possibly catatonia. Slightly more advantageous to defence than attack. Awaiting an advance from the AI can resemble watching paint dry (Don't switch the scenario timer off). When it does chose to move, it’s invariably a drip feed;LOS could be redefined as LOP(Line of Possibility). Set up a units field of fire at the start only to discover a tank in midrange has become a form of terrestrial submarine;Campaigns can become highly repetitive. Grinding over the same maps repeatedly. An exercise in patience and/or frustration;Pricing. A world unto themselves. Cited by customers and reviewers consistently as overpriced for the age of the game, game engine and the lack of development. Slitherine persist with the tried and tested fingers in ears....’la,la,la...’.How is this a positive review? Short of hitting the invisible ‘middle button’, it’s a pretty good multiplayer experience. Even single player has it’s moments and manages to show glimpses of what the game could have been if it had been given the same investment Slitherine demand of it’s audience.If you have a history of war gaming you’ll no doubt suffer through the shortcomings and gain a modicum of enjoyment. More so if you can engage the multiplayer. If you are a casual visitor to war gaming don’t damage a possible future in the area by choosing this as your initiation.Whatever your interest....wait for a sale.

The explosion, smoke and sound effects are much improved and the campaign/strategic map is nicelly done. I also like the new, more realistic mortar and fire support systems. I know that other factors have been revamped (weather, moral, weapons) but i think those changes are hard to see and the troops pretty much behave like they did back in the day.I have also seen many complaints about the price of the game being too steep for a fairly simple ''reboot''.

The campaign mode is improved from the original, as it adds in a turn-based strategy layer to define how the real-time tactical game plays. The multiplayer matchmaking is not very effective, and I think it relies upon a forum to find opponents. Overall, I think the $40 price is too much for the scope of the game. There are plenty of campaigns, operations, missions, and you can create your own, to create several hours worth of gameplay.

Since then, I've played on many of the releases and found them to be fantastic.  This game, however, has been a massive disappointment.  The interface is no bigger than 1024x768 and the map screen is a massive step backwards compared to previous releases, it just feels like a cramped mess.The battles themselves are entertaining.  I mean, they’re still exactly the same as the old games, so yeah they are good!  However, the interface is really, really dated now.  Scrolling through the map is painful, especially if you're ina  hurry. Trying to select and give orders is infuriating.  The AI has not been improved at all (as far as I can tell).The worst thing? The price.  My god. I’m all for supporting games like this, but £30? It’s almost insulting.Sorry, but it’s a no-go from me :(Do yourself a favour and go purchase Close Combat:  Invasion Normandy or any of the other previous releases!"

Having it remastered and re-released for modern operating systems is, quite literally, a dream come true. I thought I'd never play a Close Combat game again.Despite the decades old, hand-drawn graphics -- which are a totally charming aspect anyway -- this is another Close Combat which sticks to the forumla and delivers an unmatched tactical experience. This game really brings home what it is to command a Company in combat. Every last detail of your soldiers is considered, their ammunition, fatigue, morale, suppression, accuracy, and courage or cowadice. You will revel in their success and you will cringe at their destruction. You alone are responsible for both.Notable improvements include revamped explosion graphics, the addition of waypoints to movement orders, and, finally, persistent tracking of individual soldiers between battles. Your men maintain their kills, awards, and performance. A word of warning, don't become attached to a particular Platoon, because there is nothing more gut-wrenching than watching a decorated, three battle veteran, finally succumb to his own bravery.My rating: 9/10. I cannot recommend this game enough. I am a biased reviewer, that's for sure, and if you're new to the series then perhaps you'd want to wait for the price to drop. However, if you're looking for a visceral, challenging, and realistic tactical strategy game, then you cannot go past Close Combat. There is literally nothing like this on the market."

The original ones were both original, grafically ok, realistic, thrilling and big replay potential. I do not think it is quite a must to come with new ideas or even do revolution changes in a title, which works perfectly.BUT: GtC does not bring anything new after those looooong years (of course apart from better resolution). Well it probably does, but I cannot recall anything, so basically nothing really improving worth mentiong. What is the worst: if the CC had any flaws, then it was the AI - sometimes. Now the AI ""went full retard"", especially tanks. Immediatelly forget building any tank squads, because your tanks are programmed to take the worst path, turn turrets in meaningless directions, always ready to take 2+ shots before acquring aim... Spotted hidden lone enemy PzIV inside a garden and have 3 Sherms available? Well, then you have a fair chance to disable it if you coordinate the 3way attack well, but be prepared to exchange 2 out of your 3 tanks against that one. And I am talking PzIV, not Tiger neither any other german cat.Another pain is the identification of low and high ground. Sounds familiar from the past? On some maps with virtually open terrain you just don´t know why your AVs cannot shoot visible enemy units accross that field. Oops, the LOS is broken in the middle, so probably a terrain wave or something, but nothing that would indicate so.In short: I dont´t care GtC brings notning new at all. What bothers me, it completely ignores old well known problems, and not only focuses to fix them but makes them even worse! THIS ALL FOR A PRICE OF A NEW GAME!If you are a CC fan, buy this game in case:- if it ever goes under EUR 10,- (well it is 50% sale today and it is still 18,49, so wait some 10 years, LOL) and- if you are not becoming frustrated easilyPity :("

Very often you see the units getting stucked in each other. So the pathing could have been much better done.2. They could have improved the game so it's much more responsive. Just to move units takes an eternity... Like 10-15 minutes just to move a canon a few centimeters. Together with that and the unit easily gets stuck frustrates me a lot.3. No tutorial exist.4. Looks manual don't explain all things in game like for example how to deal with unintuitive battle group screen.5. 3D graphic would be great to have, instead of 2D where you see all ugly pixels (almost like in minecraft to exagerate a little or 10-15 year old games).6. A price tag as for a AAA game but which feels 10 years old, both regarding graphic and game play, is way to much. A price tag of $10-$15 max would be a better price. The price Valve and Slitherine takes feels like a scam to me.7. I need to have line of sight to shoot with most of my units. I can't even shoot through bushes. It's not very intuitive to use the mortal team for example. They seam to lack grenades as they never launch the grenades!? There is a mortal button I can press but it looks I can only use it once during a whole battle!!! Don't know if that button is for my mortal team!? If it is then I can only use that squad once in each battle more or less!? So why have a mortal team if so.8. The UI isn't very intuitive. When you for example want to zoom in to see units closer with mouse wheel you instead switch and start to look at other units!!! The line of sight thing is also something which frustrates me especially when you have canons which needs to move around to be able to shoot against tanks.SUGGESTIONS for next game:1. Much better graphic. You know 3D graphic from today.2. I hope next game will include more options regarding what you can do with units, like throwing grenades, using bazokas, use mortal team, etc... Right now it feels strategy light.3. An improved UI wouldn't hurt which is much more intuitive.4. Pathing and units which moves slightly faster could be improved. Units should move much faster if you choose ""fast move"". Units should almost run and not walk in slow motion.5. Better price tag."

Familiar to fans.Cons:Editor(feel limited and complex, no simple 'skirmish' setup (you need to read the manual and learn the editor setup and are bound to its rules.Campain(there are 6 or 7 campains (?) and some 20+ battles. As for campain-feeling (a -> b) goes i'm lost since none of them are locked and can be played whenever and in what order you fancy.)Campain and battle gameplay(There is this overview map that also pretty much requires you to read the manual to understand what it is about. Between campain maps you are turned back to this overview section but I have not managed to understand what battle that actually will start and if I can/ should do anything to my advantage on the overview section. Seem like a middle-type mini-game (like stratego), but rules? More reading in the manual...)TRUCE.In the game, truce can be 'clicked' to offer cease fire (i.e end map and continue campain but not exit). Your opponent (the 'A.I') will do so when morale, possibly among other factors, is to low. If you click it however...all my units were dead down to a sniper. I had since long pressed TRUCE. 10 min of looking at the screen (7 tanks not moving), waiting for what I think is a hidden timer. That does suck for the games that you open up with heavy losses early on - beacuse 10-15 min wait.Limited in-game help(Have a question? Don't understand what that icon means in the editor?

I don't mind the 2D look but there needs to be more player aids to deal with it.  Often you cannot tell what unit has Line of Sight or what obstacles block LoS.  In addition, you are often engaged off the screen and scrolling around is tedious(esp. if you are being fired on by someone who is concealed and you have to play ""find the pixel"" to locate them).  You also cannot zoom in and out in order to deal with this problem. The second issue is the speed of the game.  It is slow even on ""fast."" Seriously, it takes a minute for infantry to ""move fast"" 30 meters(with no obstacles) in game.  While it is probably a feature, it seems like a work around for control/AI problems. The third issue is you cannot rebind the hot-keys.  While there isn't that many, they aren't that logical.  The alternative is to find the unit, right click it and find the command you want.  Fourth is the inability to customize squads.  This makes it extremely difficult to play axis because there is almost no way to defeat Churchill tanks in the 6-8 battles I played.  I have tried to ambush it in side but that didn't work either.  This inability to deal with heavy armor is compounded by the fact that you cannot retreat(or I haven't figured it out).

I had two section with HQ platoon moving into the northern end of the map as similar amount of men to the south attached to a single Cromwell tank.

We ran into an large Panzergrenadier company with several SKDZ vehicles and backed by Mortars. We suffered heavy mortar fire and I directed the centre to flank the PzGren as i resumed the south force to clear through the south unopposed.

If you like game that rewards patience and strategy over reflex and brashness, if you like a game that lets you impliment in real time a course of action only for it to fail because your soldiers cower under the realities of battle conditions or heroicly stand to the last man and snatch victory from defeat because of courage and comradery, then this game is for you.I never met anyone who did not love this game once they learned to understand its intricacies. Every bullet counts. Not just because you can run out of bullets but also because, desperate, a courageous AI will pick up weapons and ammo from the battlefield dead while a coward will break and run with your best vehicle and ammo right before you need him most.The interface is clumsy for the modern era and their will be a learning curve as this game looks like it belongs in Windows 95 not 10. The graphics are not optimum for the modern era but functional. Vehicle drivers are terrible and so you will need to micromanage the drivers to keep them on the path. this may be the weakest part of the entire series.Still, if you can get past that then you will find the best Company sized military strategy game available, far exceeding the modern AAA such as company of hero's. it doesnt have there AAA looks, but its much more realistic psycology model and battlefield tactics makes this an infnatry commanders dream training tool."

What got me to like this series was how it got you close to the action and provided you with an efficient interface to command your combating soldiers. To me every battle I've played has been a mini *insert-your-favorite-war-flick-here*. Before long the battlefield is scarred by explosions and fire, the dead and dying are piling at the victory points and you are sitting by the keyboard ruing for Fritz or Cambell who's lying in ambush trying to capture that Sherman/Tiger-tank off-guard.The strategy portion of the game is as it's been since it's inception and as always to me a distraction, I find the heart to be in the battles. Each battle can range from 30-60 minutes so set aside some time if you choose to play the campaign.The system is impeccable, with only minor changes here and there from the previous games, and as always a wonderful historical accuracy. The battles and missions who are just based on history are noted as such.The interface is the only main concern I have. But this may be because I'm so used to the bottom-centered interface after years of playing that I'm unable to get to grips with the changes. I haven't played so much yet so maybe after a couple of more hours I'll get a hold of the new setup.Every battle is a story and if you have the time to dedicate you'll not be sorry. This is if you have a little interest for military history and good strategy games, but who doesn't? Now I just hope they'll start porting the classics too, I'd like to play The Russian Front and Invasion Normandy again, this time with support for multiplayer via Steam. Get to it!"

It's a fun little addition to the Close Combat family and for those who love this game it's more of the old, good classic gameplay with a few new fancy things (the explosions are neat). It's also a good part to introduce the newcomers, as the campaign map is pretty straightforward and the battles are on large, mostly open maps which give you a lot of leeway and let you play more with the armored troops.The only con? The price of course - I don't doubt that Matrix games put at least a little effort in making Gateway to Caen, but there is nothing that justifies the expense. Wait for the discount."

Gameplay is similar to A Bridge Too Far, the last Close Combat game I played, and this is a good thing. Really, this is what I like about these games - the realistic battles that require some degree of actual skill to succeed at.The map editor feels awkward compared to the older style, but seems like it allows much better campaigns to be developed once you get the swing of things. Infact, there is a whole new campaign design to it, albiet one I don't personally find overly interesting.Favorite new stuff: New additions such as long distance mortar and artillery support are kinda neat. There are lots of little tweaks and stuff to the same units, and a bunch of new ones. Quite a few UI updates.Least favorite new stuff: As I say, I'm not a fan of the new campaign setup beyond the above mentioned parts. I might just not be great at it, but it's really too restrictive to feel like a proper grand strategy element. It feels like you need to replicate the actual events of the battles depicted to actually succeed in most of the campaigns, which is not great when you're a pretty casual WWII history buff like me.Also, they seem to have removed the ability to see LOS during deployment, something I remember being in A Bridge Too Far, and really a ♥♥♥♥-er of many otherwise good plans. Perhaps it's a realism thing, but I think a real MG team would notice if they were setting up facing directly into a a slight bump that would completely block their line of sight.Summing it up, I am a  mixed on it because I think A Bridge Too Far does just as good a job of the parts that I enjoy. Maybe even does it a little better, really. If you somehow have a working copy of A Bridge Too Far, you might want to check out some gameplay videos of the grand strategic mode to see if it's your thing before dropping $40 on it.Dunno if it's worth $40 if you have a working copy of Bridge Too Far, but it's the game you expect, for sure."

,Recommended,297750,35000511,Posted: 16 September,all,Badgerspin,"Despite what others have to say, I think this is a pretty solid CC game. It's not as good as Invasion Normandy (which, IMHO, is one of the best games I've ever played), but it's still enjoyable. I'd recommend it to fans of the CC series. If you're new to the series, I'd wait until this goes on sale.I agree though that the pricetag is hard to justify. I guarantee that the reviews for this game would notably go up if they dropped the price by $10 - $15. I doubt the same amount of resources that go into a AAA title (or a fresh indie) went into this game; espeically given that most of the aspects of the game (and probably large swaths of the code) already existed and weren't built up from scratch. (It would be interesting to see the source code for CC:V and compare it to this one.)I know others have complained about the lack of graphics updates, but I'm happy they didn't change any of that. That's essentially what makes a CC game feel like a CC game. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.Playing as the British, it is HARD. (For me, that's part of the appeal.) It reminds me a lot of Battle of the Bulge in the early missions playing as the Allies; where you take it up the rump from the Germans on a regular basis. I feel like that's an ok comparison to the difficulty? The Germans primarily have Tiger and Panther tanks, which presents its own set of challenges. These things are BEASTS and extremely difficult to take out. (Moreso than in the other installments.) Volley fire from the flanks with multiple anti-tank troops is the better method if you don't have any tanks. If you do have tanks, going head on isn't going to work out very well for you... The front armor on Tigers feels somewhat impervious. (Which... Is kind of how it was in reality.) As always, the allied tanks feel like they're made of the finest Chinesium.This part will sound like complaints (one part definitely is), but they're just something to be aware of for those who have played previous CC games.There's been some changes in the AI. Just like all other CC games, the tanks never really go where you want them to. Now, they'll randomly try to punch through a hedgerow and get tracked when a road was right next to them. Your drivers are idiots, but now they're even bigger idiots. With commands, there's a lag time that wasn't there before. Your troops may or may not take their sweet time getting somewhere when you tell them to move fast. They've pretty obviously nerfed mortars, but I think in Invasion Normandy they were a bit overpowered. (the 60mm's definitely were.) Now they're closer to what they were in Battle of the Bulge. However, they also seem to be less accurate now as well. Not that they were ever overly accurate, but you'll be able to tell a difference from previous installments.My biggest complaint about the game is that the customization of the units you can deploy isn't there anymore. With Invasion Normandy, this was my favorite aspect. I'm surprised they didn't keep that in. Instead, your bound to what is a mostly confusing system of what you can and can't switch around. It's a bit... Obnoxious? I don't really see the point of this change."
