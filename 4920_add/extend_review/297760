Its not terrible, in fact the first hour or so is fun, but definitely not worth the price. Especially once you realize that when you've seen the two types of track youve pretty much seen everything the game has to offer.So I love ancient Rome. An ancient Rome chariot racing game is an awesome idea. It reminds me of the chariot race missions in Shadow of Rome. (A really really fun PS2 game. If you are a fan of gladiator games, get it!  And enjoy cutting people's arms off, beating them with it, then tossing it into the crowd..) But this review isnt about Shadow of Rome. Its about Qvadriga. Which unfortunately, is no where near as cool as the concept could be.Now, I wouldnt have as much of a problem with it if it wasn't 20 freakin' dollars. So what do you get for 20 dollars? A tiny-graphic boring game. I normally dont really care about graphics if the gameplay is engrossing, but this game unfortunately lacks that quality, so all you keep on thinking were damn, this would be cool if it actually had decent images of the action.So a basic rundown. You start, and pick your faction. Different factions have different abilities that are explained in tooltips. Some are stronger, faster, can handle their chariots better. Then a map appears with different regions. There are many different regions, each with different tracks in them. Lots of tracks to run on with many random events is a giant plus, except for one issue which shall be explained later.When you start, you can pick one region, and each region has 1 track unlocked. Then a screen where you can look at your  charioteers, get vet services, repairs and healing, and upgrade your horses and chariots. Heres the kicker. Once you pick your first track, you cannot leave it until you get your ""fame"" up enough from racing. So if you pick a hard as hell track (as I did my first try), youre pretty much stuck. Pick which charioteer you want to race with, and you are off.The graphics are really simple, a top down view of chariots on a track. Looks like tiny mobile game graphics. There are two modes, one where the action stops every 10 seconds to give a command, one where it doesnt but you still only are give a command every so often. The commands are accelerate (to a certain level, then you can't), brake, crash right/left (slam your chariot into an opponent a la ben hur), lacerate (whip an opponent), small/medium/large move left or right (each one moves you farther across the lanes), watch for attacks (basically a block) and control (basically do nothing, but it makes your control go up), and finally whip (allows your horses to get a burst of speed, but you can hurt them).There are many different tracks to race on, some narrow, some larger. Each track has a brief paragraph about its history. Every time you race there are slighty different variables on the track, described in a simple sentence before the race. Theres lots of these, both bad and good and they provide some variety.Youre going to need it. This game is grindy as hell.See, you get money for racing, more if you win. You use this money to buy better guys, horses and chariots. You also need to pay for vet and repairs from racing damage. Each wheel, horse, and charioteer has a life bar. Take too much damage, and a horse dies, leaving you to pull with 3. Go too fast, and your wheel gets damaged. Go too fast around a corner and you can topple your chariot, leaving your guy to be dragged by his horses. You then have the option of running (and the other guys can hit you, or hanging on till youre in a safe spot to run.There are stats, represented by icons. The different stats ccombine to make the upgrades (say a horse with two speed icons vs a horse with 1 speed and 1 endurance - which one do you want.. The two speed will be faster but weaker than the 1 speed 1 endurance)But theres only 6 guy types (stats: skill - how good of a driver you are, and constitution - how much damage you can take) and 9 horse types (stats: speed - top speed, and endurance - same as con but for the horse) and 9 chariot types( stats: acceleration and size, again same as con but for the chariot). And they are expensive as hell.It also costs money to travel from track to track, and you can't race certain tracks till you get more famous. So you will probably doing the same race over and over just to get enough cash to go somewhere else.Theres two types of track, a tight oval type and a longer wider type. Except for this, there is absolutely nothing to differentiate them.A $20 game this is not. It can be fun for a little bit, and if it had some kind of multiplayer it'd be pretty fun. But as it is, its just boring after the first hour or so."

But don't judge a game on your first impression as you wouldn't judge a book by its cover (I have a feeling you'd like books as much as I do if you've come here).This game delivers unexpected levels of tactical depth and attention to details, and truly deserves its sale price if not its full price.The core gameplay is based on managing your speed and taking the decision to whip your horses to push them over their limits, or whip your opponents to incapacitate them, ram their chariots, cripple their horses, trample your dismounted rivals - playing it brutal is all part of the games, and the capable AI will use every trick in the book.Campaign-wise, racing is rewarded with denarius (the currency of the Roman Empire) to build your team with upgraded chariots, horses and skilled drivers-slaves. Good results also increase your fame which will open up the doors of more prestigious stadiums, several dozens of them available in seven provinces, up to the great Circus Maximus of Rome if you prove worthy. Completing a campaign requires about 10 hours of gameplay, more if you invest time to skill up your team of slaves and acquire the top quality chariots and horses.The little things: random events spice up each race. Cities offer various bonuses and some historical background. A random name generator use the cultural origins of your recruits and your rivals to give them all unique names. Successful drivers get their amount of victories tracked after their name. Last but not least, you'll pick up some Latin vocabulary to impress lesser-educated nerds!Stultorum infinitus est numerus, am I right? ;)"

It plays like an old tabletop board game, or perhaps something from the earliest days of pc gaming. It's very well designed in terms of balance and mechanics. The problem is the price for the extremely limited amount of content this game represents. Qvadriga is an excellent $3 to $5 cell phone game, not a $20 pc game. *If* you can get it on sale, for an accurate price, then I highly recommend it, but in a world where indy games with staggering levels of content like Xenonauts and FTL are $25 and $10 respectively, charging $20 for this anemic little game is both insulting and insane."
,Recommended,297760,14411332,"Posted: 9 February, 2015",all,Bad Whippet,"What is it?A top-down racing/strategy game based on Roman chariot racing.  The game plays in eitherdynamic(real-time) where you give your aurigas orders on the move, orstaticwhich plays as turn-based control over sections of the course (rather like a board game).You start the game with three men, their chariots and horses belonging to one of 6 factions (each with its own strengths/weaknesses and a couple of extra upgrade points).  You visit the shop for repairs and upgrades, then kit out and send one team into a race at a time, allowing other teams to recover from your last folly (if you can afford the fees and repairs, that is)!When playing the turn-based variant, each 'turn' lasts for a highlighted section of track around the circus.  Looking at the section and the positions of your opponents, you have a choice of moves you can click (only one action is allowed per turn).  Crucially, these include speeding up or slowing down, switching lanes, taking a defensive stance or whipping, blocking or even crashing into your opponents (no-one said this was a clean fight)!  If you're playing the dynamic version the chariots never stop so you have to think fast and give orders with good timing.  What you choose is pivotal to your survival and your success.  If things go bad (and they will), your man's chariot will break up, leaving him dragging face-first in the dirt.  Do you risk everything by insisting he hangs on until the very end (after all, a finish IS a finish...) or do you tell him to run away while he still has his life?  Your escapee causes the race to be forfeit but at least your man is still alive (if he didn't get trampled...).  New men are expensive to recruit, and no racers means no more game.  You have been warned!To keep things fresh, each circus has its own pros and cons, there are random events that help or hinder you, crowds might lob objects at you, or the debris of other casualties might just finish you off.   While it might seem that luck plays a hand, strategic moves will win the race.GameplayThe game is entirely mouse-driven and is accompanied by a decent PDF manual.  The races are simple and intuitive (all choices are displayed on screen in front of your horses and you simply click the move to be made that turn).  However, the user interface for the shop and upgrades is a little confusing (the game could really use some tooltip text help for its buttons as well as mouse-over feedback to show what can and cannot be clicked) but once you understand how to use it and how to buy the most suitable upgrades, everything is fine.Longevity and value]The game brings that level of addictiveness associated with any game where you upgrade and then progress a bit further each time to earn more upgrades.  Your campaign is lengthy and is retained between sessions so you can pick up where you left off last time.   This is no 10-minute throwaway game.The idea is genius and it's a unique and original game.  Production quality is best described as 'functional' with no added polish (there is no fun commentary as was advertised in the video, and it lacks any graphic touches like cut-scenes of a win (or a tragedy).  This by no means affects the enjoyment of the game and will mean it can run on any level of kit, but it's sat firmly in the £15 territory where a little bit more polish is usually expected.  This is a minor gripe only as the game is otherwise excellent.  If you have doubts, there is a free demo you can download.  The game can also be bought on Android/iOS (full game with no in-app purchases)."

However the game play does get a bit repetitive as the racing part of it is really all there is.The price is a bit of a factor, I feel it is quite overpriced for what it is, at best this is a $10 game but realistically a $5 one.The addition of multiplayer with leader boards would have made this game epic fun and more worth the price tag.A bit more depth in the gameplay would have also been helpful too, such as having actual stables to train horses, riders etc. Really any game content outside of the racetrack would have been nice like using money to build your own mansion adding to your prestige level that would in turn attract more skillful riders, chariot builders things of that nature.In the end it is pretty clear this is a tablet game converted to be played on pc, and the tablet version is exactly the same at a lower price so this gets a thumbs down."

76561198022734065,Recommended,297760,24453905,"Posted: 21 July, 2016",all,Yasha,"TL;DR SUMMARYOne of the most enjoyable strategy race games in many years. The worst part is the non-sensical pricing strategy of the publisher ($19.99 on PC, $9.99 on Android, $4.99 on iOS - all for the same game). Put it on your wishlist and wait for the price to hit $9.99 or less on Steam. Most negatives about this game center on the price, not the game itself. This is mispriced gem.DETAILED REVIEWThis game was so enjoyable, I spent dozens of hours experimenting with factions, upgrading my drivers, chariots, and horses, developing racing strategies and collecting game data about different cities, just so I could successfully manage teams to the Circus Maximus at Rome.The game is deceptively simple - each ""turn"" of play you pick one order for your driver. The trick is dealing with the other drivers while positioning your team for the next corner. Drive too close inside, especially with an inexperienced driver, and you might suffer a costly crash. Horses, chariots and even your driver can suffer damage. Flipped or wrecked chariots result in the driver being dragged by the horses until he escapes, crosses the finish line, or dies.Each individual race takes 5 to 10 minutes to play. However, it takes multiple races to get the ""feel"" of the hidden variables and probabilities, so you can race intelligently and make money - instead of losing your toga (like I did the first few times). But the real game starts when you play the campaign.The campaign starts in your choice of a (probably distant) Imperial province, in a small city, with a few drivers, horse sets and chariots. It's your job to make enough money racing that you can cover the inevitable damage costs, upgrade your team and build your fame. With fame comes access to higher status cities with better rewards and better equipment. Eventually you'll want to travel to new provinces with more cities, on your way to the ultimate racing venue: the Circus Maximus in Rome.The game's user interface and graphics are indie in spirit. The track and chariots are in top-down view. Gentle tints on the driver, chariot (wheels) and horses show exhaustion and/or damage. Despite this, the game oozes atmosphere, from the type fronts, to the crisp clear icons, to the blood smear on the sandy-tan track marking the death of a charioteer. Everything about the game reminds you of Imperial Rome.From a game design standpoint, the inner workings are excellently balanced. Chances of damage or disaster change with multiple variable. Even a risk-averse manager will find rare, random event can set back the best laid plans, or provide an unexpected success. Incautious, wild racers are heavily punished -you cannot rely on ""good luck"" or constant aggression to win this game. The AI drivers are intelligent, and occasionally unpredictable. If they have no hope of winning themselves, they may even block your chances out of pure malice or spite! The temptation to bash them off the track is strong, even though it won't profit you.This game reminds me of chariot race boardgames from 30 to 40 years ago. However, Qvadriga is vastlymore playable than those clunky endeavors. Those old boardgames had fewer variables, took 1-3 hours per race to play, and had no AI players! Besides, Qvadriga's campaign game is infinitely more interesting and playable than anything available in those old boardgames.Yes, it would be nice if the game had beautifully animated isometric or 3D racing graphics. We all dream about drivers that animate appropriately in response to your orders, or when victims of attacks, not to mention chariot wheels coming off, chariots flipping, horses dying in collisions, and chariots bouncing over the wreckage of other chariots and dead horses, plus drivers being dragged or running away, sometimes to a gruesome death. However, the chances of that game being made is infinitely small, given the current state of strategy games, publisher investment resources, and the technical limitations of building games for mobile as well as the PC.Yes, it would also be nice if the game allowed for human opponents. But do I want to wait hours until another human player is available? Am I expected to run a private serve? Do I expect the poor, cash-strapped developer (or publisher) to maintain a multi-player server for me and the nineteen other English speakers in the world who just might want to play each other? Do I expect an online chat system as well? For a niche game like this, it is quite understandable that we're limited to offline play only.The only REAL fault with this game is publisher's (Slitherine's) inane pricing strategy. Today (July 21, 2016), the very same game costs $19.99 for the PC (on Steam), $9.99 for Android (at the Google Play Store), and $4.99 for iOS (in the iTunes store). Yes, the game is priced lowest on the platform that has the richest customer base! If I were the developer, I'd be outraged by this inconsistent pricing. As other reviewers have noted, the $19.99 price needlessly discourages PC purchases. Personally, I believe the publisher has simly lost track of any rational pricing strategy for this two-year-old title.  It's really a shame. This is a timeless, great, little racing game. Put it on your wishlist and wait for $9.99 or less."

The game design is brilliant, but the UI design is absolutely abysmal.  You have to wonder what the devs were smoking when they designed the UI.The game is easy to play, but hard to master.  It will take many many hours of play to win the game.  It hasn't been updated in quite some time, so I don't think there will be any more updates.  You have to manage your drivers (Qvadrigas), your chariots, your horses, and your medical treatments.  The early part of the game is the most difficult, because your qvadrigas are just starting out, and they are not very good.   'Das24680' has published a very good LP series on YouTube.This game is definitely worth playing as long as you're not too focused on the UI - especially with a 1920x1080 monitor."

It is very challenging with a smatter of luck involved. It can be frustrating but for the most part the frustration is do to my own aggressivness and stupidity. Nothing worse than seeing my favorite jock, ""Crapus Irregulus"" Die a bloody death because I tried to take a turn too fast. Or my up and comer ""Redd Doggybone"" be whiped to death because I failed to put the defensive posture on because I forgot or thought the other jock wouldn't whip me to death.I love the strategy of should I take a chance and go fast arond the curve or swing wide and avoid all the traffic. Whip them early and often and hope to hold on or save your horses stamina for the end. Whip them to go faster and hope the dam jock in front of me to the left dosn't decided to cut me off or change lanes to get away from hims so I can whip them next turn.Great game!"

You effectively just need to pay for repairs as appropriate and select the squad that has the highest health. There is nothing on this side of the game that is even noteworth. Every skill is reduced to a three point scale, where you either have zero, one or two of each stat. With the racer, chariot and horses each having some skills.Because there is no variance in the types of races there is no question between whether you put in the horses with higher endurance or not. You race your healthiest and highest scoring squad every single time, no question.Also, the time played on this game is screwed up because there's a start menu that counts as the game. So that was open after I stopped playing and added way a good amount of time to my playtime.So the game doesn't offer much on this side of the game, what does it offer in terms of racing?Unfortunately there isn't much here either.Each turn you choose between accelerating, whipping (""advance acceleration""), lane changes, stability for turning corners or some form of attack on your opposition.That doesn't sound like an issue until you start to see how much of a grind that actually is. There is always a clear best decision, I think the only time there's debate of which decision is best is when choosing which attack. Unfortunately the attacks are too strong. One bad attack against you and you've almost certainly lost the race and might as well give up.I don't know what you should pay for this game. But I'd certainly be waiting for at least 70% off."

So if you've been on the fence, pick a side now!Like the very best of games out there, it's a mechanically-simple approach to turn-based racing - chariot racing, mind you - that has clearly been inspired by similarly-themed board games of old.  Also like the very best of games out there, its simplicity belies its depth.  While races last about 5-10 minutes of real-time at most - making it the perfect pick-up-and-play game - you only have a handful of actions you can do on each turn, Qvadriga provides a tactical experience that gives you the right 'feel' of racing around in ancient Rome.Unlike the staggered starts of the Olympics, chariots will line up side-by-side or even one behind another with random start positions, leading to seemingly unfair, foregone conclusions.  However, unlike the Olympics, it's perfectly okay to kill your opponents or their horses by whipping them to death or smashing your chariot into them, which might also damage their wheels enough to throw the driver out, only to be dragged to near-certain death.  Not satisfied?  It's also perfectly okay to position yourself to block opponents, often causing them to violently smash into your backside, hurting their horses, and therefore their overall speed.  Just be mindful that what you can do to others can also be done to you.While there are similarities to other racers like Gallop Racer or Derby Owner's Club in that you must manage your horse's stamina during the race (too much damage and they slow down, whip 'em to make 'em go faster at the risk of hurting or killing them), the true depth of the game comes from tactically positioning yourself and upsetting your opponents to get ahead.  This will be difficult at first, but you will soon be able to second-guess the guy behind you with a pretty good degree of accuracy.  Do you try to take the inside lane and make the turn at speed, risking your chariot flipping over?  Do you hang back a little bit so you can whip your opponent from his chariot?  Do you smash your own chariot into his horses, hoping to drop his four-horse team to a three?  Or do you sacrifice the health of your own horses and whip 'em for that extra burst of speed, possibly slowing you down for the remainder of the race if you bleed them?With single races available, the meat of the game is actually its campaign mode where the goal is to gain enough fame for your team to be invited to the Circus Maximus, the most electrifying arena in Roman entertainment where you can race for the millions (AND MILLIONS) of your team's fans.  Essentially you will start off by picking one of the available historical factions which will give you various starting bonuses, but don't worry too much about that as you will eventually replace all of your drivers, horses and chariots over time.  From there, you start racing, hoping to survive those early moments until you can make enough money to afford some good stuff.  Nothing will stop you from winning, mind you, if you've got the wherewithall to do so.  In between races, you will be able to see your team's fame on the local level (with several cities to make your name in) and on the global level.  Then you can manage your team, from pure maintenance to purchasing upgrades with your winnings which includes faster, stronger horses, higher quality and more durable chariots, and tougher and more skilled drivers.  Each stat for each component of your entry plays into your tactics for the upcoming race.  If you front a team of toughness, chances are you'll want to do your best to take out the city's top leaders (who are easily identifiable by their faction color and the number of wins they hold) whereas a faster team will be more dead set on getting a podium finish.  Finally, before each race, should you choose to do so, you can place a bet that your team will win and the payouts are tremendous if you manage to do so.  Keep it going and if you don't manage to kill all of your drivers, eventually new venues will open up to you for more glory and fame and money.Overall this is a wonderful little gem of a title and while it won't necessarily hook you with its bland visuals and minimal sound design, once you figure out its magic, you'll be drawn in wholesale."

The graphics and sound are purely functional, but they do serve their purpose.  I always play in turn-based mode, and the fun comes from analyzing your situation during each of your turns and trying to choose the optimal action to improve your situation.  These actions include things like: Do I flog my horses for a brief burst of speed now at the cost of horse endurance?  Do I flog my oponent and risk losing my whip, or crash my chariot into him and risk becoming stunned?  What's the closest lane that I can safely take a turn and set myself up nicely afterwards?  And so on.If you enjoy lite strategy, you will probably find some enjoyment here.  But it is lite and probably best enjoyed in small doses.  Doing pre-race team management and completing a single race probably takes about five to ten minutes.  You will be frustrated when things randomly go wrong, but also elated when you round that last corner a bit too fast, overturn your chariot and grin as your driver is able to endure long enough to be dragged over the finish line, winning you the race.However, the price seems a bit steep.  At $10 I could wholeheartedly recommend buying it, but at $20, you might want to wait for a sale if you're on the fence about it.  Matrixgames has a demo on their website, and you might want to watch a ""Let's Play"" video to see the game in action."

,Not Recommended,297760,21501506,"Posted: 27 February, 2016",all,justus,"As many other negative reviews note: this is an interesting concept that becomes repetitive all too quickly. I first heard about Qvadriga via Rock, Paper, Shotgun that called it the Best Racing Game of 2014. I find my tastes often align with RPS so I was looking forward to trying this out.Qvadriga is a one-man effort from Daniel Soria at Turnopia games, ""a humble attempt to achieve the ideal of turn based games"". He delivers a relatively unique concept in his chariot-racing game: your charioteer has a pretty decent chance of dying. And there's often not much you can do about it. You're often at the mercy of the RNG. In many ways it feels like a rogue-like. I finished 37 races in my (unfinished) campaign. I came in first on about 33% of them. I had 8 charioteers get killed in the line of duty.If you embrace that, it means you sometimes are rewarded with more interesting stories than most racing games will give you. Let me tell you about the time that my top-ranked charioteer had his chariot disintegrate underneath him rounding the corner on the final stretch; he was in first place and rather than lose, let his horses drag him the last stretch across the finish line. Or the time my rookie charioteer gambled it all on a risky inner-lane turn to take first place. Or the time, just seconds after the race started, my #1 charioteer got whipped, stunned, and then was whipped to death before the first turn!Unfortunately, moments like those -- great as they are -- don't make up for the short comings. There seems to be no relationship between ""famous charioteers"" and their skills in the races. I consistently beat the globally famous guys with 16 wins....and lose out to some no-name guy in the backwaters of Syria. The game seems to level-up your competitors so they are always approximately the same skill as you.Despite playing for hours, I never once had a charioteer level up. The game gives some indications it is possible but I never saw it happen. That lack of progression contributes to the sense of sameness. I went from Hispania to Gaul to Italy to Macedonia to Syria and the races felt the same no matter where I was. There are a few varieties in track (some are narrow with just 4 chariots, some are wide with 12 chariots) but that's about it.The ""sports management sim"" part of the game is pretty thin, as is the campaign. If these were better developed it might make up for the repetition and randomness/lack of skill of the races themselves. I quickly amassed more money than I knew what do with (80,000 denarii and nothing much to spend it on) and often spent it travelling the world just to see if anything was different anywhere.The core racing is fun but just doesn't offer enough variety. You also have to accept that some races are unwinnable through no fault of your own. If you start out in the middle of a pack of 12, and get lashed by a neighbor, you're going to have difficulty placing. Likewise, sometimes you'll get a random event -- like the one where your charioteer gets bribed to brake after the first turn -- that makes it hard to come out on top.Those aren't the end of the world, since the game does give you a kind of rogue-like feeling of failure being okay. But it often made me feel like success and failure wasn't really up to me or my tactics. I won around 1/3 of my races but in 1/4 of my races I didn't place in the top three and I had essentially the same team the whole time. (Sure, I went through various charioteers but their stats were all similar.)There's a lot of potential here but as-is, the novelty wore off for me after a few hours. I'm glad I picked it up on sale and only paid $5, so I feel like I got decent value from the game."

The learning curve is pretty steep, but as you get the hang of it, you really get sucked in. Usually set backs are not game breaking. On my first play through, I lost my drivers and chariots quickly, and could not recover, but only because I didn't know what I was doing. I went back, looked over the tutorial, started a new game, was more careful this time, and I've been having a great campaign. I've had my set backs still, but always have recovered from them and surged to new levels despite them. A word to the wise: don't imagine this is a game you can easily win on your first race. You will have to work hard for each victory. But they are all the more rewarding when they come.You will also quickly develop rivalries with other teams' charioteers (called auriga in the game). Currently, I've got a very heated rivalry going with a fellow named Alpheaus. After he took out two of my horses and almost killed an auriga at the very start of a race, I've had it out for him ever since. And he likes gunning for me, too. Makes the races very interesting when he's around.In response to critics who say there are only two types of track: first of all, each type has many variations within. Some are longer, some are shorter, some are wider, some are thinner. No two tracks are exactly the same, and each one has unique strategies required to be successful. Second, in ancient Rome this is exactly how it was. Two types of track (Greek style and Roman style), but with variations all over the place. Each race also will have a random event at the start, sometimes good, sometimes bad, to add to the variation. There's also different combinations of auriga skills, chariot types, and horse quality.In total, this is a great game. I think it is worth $20. But if you can pick it up on sale, that's always good, too. I give it a 9/10."

And a really nice, simple mechanic, easy to understand, quick to get into, but really intriguing to play. That sounds great, right? Well, it is. The apparent simplicity of chariots trundling around the track actually creates a really interesting set of challenges, where the positions of chariots around you mean you have to carefully consider every turn, with different races unfolding to reward different tactics. It's like a really, really good board game.Except...The graphics are super-simple, 2d. That isn't a problem, but it feels more like a five dollar mobile game.The individual races are interesting, but there is no sense of story or progression, no apparent end-game, no rivalries to develop with other teams, and little ability to develop your drivers. Further, there is no Hall of Fame where you can compare your drivers' achievements nor mourn for those who have died. And all of that is a shame.Also, there is no multiplayer. Given that this plays like a boardgame - like the sort of thing you'd want to get out for half an hour to play with your friends around the coffee/dining table - it's a real shame that there is no internet multiplayer option (nor any other multiplayer).So, if you're interested in an unusual little strategy game - one that you can keep coming back to and dipping into for an engaging coffee-break distraction - then this is absolutely worth having. But it's hard to justify much more than $5 for it.Recommendation: add to wishlist; wait for it to be reduced."

Wait for a sale.This is a great little game with a surprising amount of depth and fun to be had. The turn based gameplay requires a lot of strategy and its thrilling to pull off a race victory, and devestating when you lose your best auriga. The content of the game just enables it to overcome its horrific and clumsy presentation. The game is incredibly unforgiving for newcomers, however the documentation that comes with the game (and the in depth guide available in the guides section) enables you to jump into the game with some confidence. Though expect to lose horribly on your first attempt, and I definitley would not reccomend jumping into the game without reading all of that first.The one negative I will say though is the game is not worth full price at $20. There's not enough content to warrant that price. Grab it on sale if you can."
