,Recommended,297860,12392247,"Posted: 6 October, 2014",all,Stexen92,"Split/Second is, hands down, my favorite racing game ever and one of my all-time best games.  I bought this game for both the PC and the PS3 even before it came to Steam and I played the hell out of both versions.  This is a great game that any racing fan should play at least once and is also a great entry game for those wishing to check out the genre.The premise of this game is, frankly, not very original but sets up the game nicely.  You are a contestant on the new explosive racing show Split/Second.  During the course of the ""season"" you will have to compete in races to advance to the next ""episode.""  Finishing higher in events will get you more points and will allow you to progress further in the season.  Each episode is capped off by an Elite Race, a race around the track against Split/Second's best drivers.  Beat each episode to win the season championship.  Like I said, not very original but it gets the job done.The gameplay is very simple.  You race around a track, drift around the corners and use power-ups to destroy your opponants.  However, the center piece of this game is that it doesn't use traditional power-ups like those in Mario Kart or Blur.  Instead, you attain energy through drifts, drafts, and air-time.  Once you have enough, you can activate power-plays on the track, which usually involve destroying parts of the track to crush your rivals.  Filling up your energy all the way will allow you activate the biggest power plays on the track and will also allow you to change the track's route (if the track has a route changer).  Racing hard while effectively using your power plays are essential if you want to win the season championship.In addition to the races, there are also several other types of events.  The first one is Elimination.  It's similar to the race, but there aren't any set laps.  Instead, a there is a timer that counts down.  When the timer reaches zero, the last place car is eliminated from the race.  Survive all eliminations to win.The second event is the Air Strike, where a helicopter shoots missles at you and you have to dodge the missle waves in order to gain points.  The longer you last, the harder the waves become to dodge.  Gain the most points to win the event.A variant of the Air Strike event is the Air Revenge, which is kind of like a boss fight.  Instead of getting points for dodging missles, you get power-play energy in addition to the energy you get from drifts and jumps.  You can then use the energy to reflect the missiles back at the helicopter.  Down the helicopter in the shortest amount of time to win.The final event is by far my favorite: Survival.  Here, semis are driving around a track while dropping bombs in front of you in order to kill you.  As you stay alive and pass these trucks, you gain points.  Passing several trucks in a row without dying will increase your score multiplyer.  Get the highest score to win the event.  I have sunk hours on end trying to beat my own high scores, so I think you'll get alot out of this mode.On the down side, this game's graphics are pretty standard.  It looks okay, but if you're more accustomed to the realistic racing games like Forza then you'll definately notice the difference.  There are also some glitches and hitbox issues that, while not game-breaking, can lead to outburts of rage over what the heck just happened.  Sometimes, though, the glitches can be entertaining in their own right (like getting killed by an explosion and restarting a hundred feet in the air).  These issues, however, are very infrequent and most likely won't dampen you experience.[EDIT] As for the controls, there isn't a manual shifting option, which I don't mind but some might be a bit miffed that this wasn't included.  Also, the initial key set-up is a bit weird.  You drive using the arrow keys and use the right control and right shift buttons to activate power plays.  I assume this was done so that a second player could use the WASD area of the keyboard when doing split-screen.  Thankfully, this is easily remediated since all inputs can be remapped in the Options menu, but it's still a bit jarring when you first start.So those are the basics of Split/Second.  It is very simplistic but very addictive.  There's also a bit more to the game than what I mentioned, but I'll leave you to discover those on your own if you wish to pursue this game.  Score: 8/10"

76561198064839739,Recommended,297860,13011815,"Posted: 19 November, 2014",all,East,"If you don't want to read this boring a** review, then I'll say this, it's okay for a PC version, but I would rather have the console version to have a better experince. But the game itself is great if you enjoy a pure arcade expeince. So for the main portion of this game I'll give it a recommend.After playing this game four years since its release, I've really got my money's worth because of the excitement that this game provides. But first let me say that this will be mostly based on my review on the console (which I played the game mostly on).Okay so how should I say about this game: Micheal Bay explsions (the good kind!), crazy crashes, on edge races, and drifting everywhere! This game provdies a great orginal arcade experince to the racing genre by using the enviroment as your weapon. Exploding taxi cars to a falling cargo plane, this game provides an on edge experince that puts you on your toes, watching for the enviroment that may crush your chance at winning. There's a great varity of obstacles that you can use to crash your oppenents to gain that first spot position. Even though after a while that you'll immediately remember what objects that will be used by your opponents, the fun factor is about stragatizing your moves, or powerplays. Powerplays are basicly your main mechanic of triggering the enviroment around you to stop your opponents from pulling away. With the blue bars representing the small powerplays that are mostly scattered around the tracks. And you have your red bars which triggers the more drastic or ""epic"" powerplays which will most likely wreck your opponents. These powerplays are fairly balanced which you can aviod by memorizing their actions when being acitvated. The objects that you can use your powerplay on has a nice unique features based on what enviroment is being raced on.The tracks in this game are decent to say the best. Some have a good balance of alternative routes, but there are some routes that can completely waste a considerable amount of time, expically with shortcuts. But at the same time with shortcuts (which are used by powerplays), the game is trying to teach you again to stratagize your powerplays bars so that you can be prepared whenever you come across one.Back to the track design, the tracks in the game can be both fun and fustrating, based on your vehicle of choice and playstyle. Tracks like Downtown or Power Plant can be a bit fun and annoying at the same time because of the tight corners, but can be mastered with throttle control and again the vehicle of choice. Whereas tracks like Dry Docks will rely more of vehicles with higher speed and a bit less corner efficiancy.The vehicles in the game are decent to say the less in terms of being competitive. I feel that the majority of the cars in the game aren't that useful to drive because of their drifting capabilities. There are some that drifts out really wide and doesn't grip that well with the road and there are those that can grip around corners like it's on rails. But that doesn't goes to say that those that grip that well while drifting are bad. The Goliath and the Titan, which are trucks, are mostly useful for tracks that isn't technical and rely more on straights.The handling in this game is a bit weird. You can't simply do a smooth turn in a long hander turn of a chicane because of the dramatic loss of speed as compared to the tapping on the analog stick. So wheel users, I wouldn't even bother.... But the pro about the handling is that each car has its own handling characteristic, so every exeprince with a different car would be different than the other, which is great for a arcade game.Comparing the AI's to the PC port and the console port, it's better in a sense that the AI's are compeitive, but at the same time, the rubberbanding is a bit ridiculous in the PC port which makes it fustrating to get 1st in all races.How do I think of the PC port as compared to the console overall? Honeslty, it sucks. There's a couple of things that may turn PC players away from this game: One is the frames are capped to 30fps, which to some is immersive breaking, but personally for me I don't really mind that much. Second is the icons for the Xbox controller isn't there......at all. I'm literally shocked to see that Blackrock (which went defunt) or Disney Interactive didn't even add controller support for the PC port. The graphic options isn't there either, just the basic quality options. So if you want to turn off AA or lower the shadows, that AIN'T happenin'. Some of the sounds in this game are muffled, which is weird. From what I've heard, the multiplayer is dead, unless you use a third party software or program. And oh yeah, there's no DLC for this port either, which made me a bit disappointed.Overally, I'm a bit neutral about this port, the basic's in this game isn't that different with the console port, which I'm glad, but I wish that they gave the PC version more support to make it equally enjoyable."

,Recommended,297860,13057956,"Posted: 23 November, 2014",all,siddNullus,"If you haven't played this, consider your life a huge waste of time.This is my absolute favorite of my three most-loved combat racing games (BLUR and Burnout Revenge being the other two).  Every bit as good as the console version for XBox 360 or the cloud-based OnLive service - and with a controller, it plays the same.  Highly recommended for a great, highly-entertaining racer.  It's a lot of fun and will uninstall/reinstall to your account without issue.  Sure, I have some gripes about frame-rate and resolution options, but it's easy to overlook those.  Don't let yourself miss out on the experience of one of the greatest racing games ever made.  Maybe someday another company will hijack this basic concept and run with it, taking advantage of new-gen graphics and processing.Note:  There is a save-game glitch that occurs at or after the Midway Pass episode.  Don't quit the game when this appears or else you'll risk your save file corrupting and losing all of your progress.  You can get around the glitch by playing through the next two or three races (the number of races you'll need to play through seems to depend upon where the autosave glitch happens).  This glitch will resolove itself and, once it does, you can continue playing as normal or exit the game without worrying about the autosave file corrupting itself and erasing your prior race history.  Whatever you do:  don't exit the game before the glitch has a chance to resolve itself."

,Recommended,297860,21277415,"Posted: 17 February, 2016",all,Whiteswart,"Split/Second is a year 2010 arcade racing game, which goes faster than NFS right from the start, and giving much more king-sized demolition than the Flatout. With that said, it is a mediocre game, which can be fun, but not for long. There are enough of breathtaking sequences, but they satisfy much better from the backseat, on youtube, rather than playing that yourself.No doubt, it is an engrossing moment, when in the middle of race a transatlantic Boing crushing right on your head. And it is even better when you dodge this flight in the last second. Too bad, but for the most time of gameplay, you'll be the one under the blast and not one around it.Of course, like almost always, there are non-optimal controls. But, what is more, there are too little field for player to tweak the race for own benefit, but to choose a car to drive. Those cars provides a little of variety in proportions between speed, acceleration, and so on, but, in the most cases, you'll be driving two, maybe four cars through the whole game. All other variants are just ""for show"", for ""big numbers"", and not for real variety and usability. You can't really tune cars for your style of driving or for certain circumstances, that is the first real downside.Second big mishap is AI, which will always be one step ahead of you, even after you managed to blow all and everything around you in little pieces. Just the few seconds later, it will be you who'll be ripped apart, without any chance to dodge.Yeah, about demolitions, dodging and racing in general. The main feeling from racing is the same as with NFS games - you can push from borders without loosing speed, you almost not need to slow down in corners, and yet catching the track just fine. But when it comes to dodging the explosions... It turns out that their physical modelling is very far from natural. For a thousand times you'll be thinking you are ways away from blast, but will be in flames an instant later.And the fourth nail is the bad optimisation. I have a dvd with that game which works much better than ""always updated"" steam version. There are a major problem with missable/breakable save games, which made so many people raged there on steam. Blast the DRM!With all that said about downsides of the game, I'm still vouching that you may try it. Especially if you buy it with some major discount about 80% of price... I'd say that Blur, the classmate of Split/Second, is much better, and should be picked first, for much more enjoyment... But Steam not selling Blur anymore. So if you are into arcade racing, but get tired of NFS and Flatout series both, get Split/Second! It'll give you some fresh air, if only for two or three nights... It's still better than nothing, right? And what a marvelous explosions you'll taste there!Overall mark - 6.95/10 - best when under 5$ price, even better in some bundle."

You drift, you fill your bar, you blow objects up as your opponents pass them, and if you collect enough drift points, you can do some big ones like explosively redesign the race course.

Have been playing the game since it's release in 2010.  It's like an easy, outgoing friend of yours with whom you can always have fun.The game is stunning visually, breathtaking action wise and really easy to play. Considering this is a game of 2010 and it feels like something of this year, gives it a lot of credit.You race through different destructible tracks, blowing up your opponenents via triggered explosions and changing the track altogether. There is almost no HUD to inhibit your perception of shower of visual effects thrown at you. There are many different cars for different tastes and playstyles, each handles and acts differently on the track. Great dynamic soundtrack changing to the pace of action.The only downside for me is that it does not have official multiplayer support. This game deserves to be on Steam servers. As an alternative you can use Hamachi if you have a group of friends or tune in to Tunngle server room of Split/Second to play with random people (unfortunately cheaters are present there).Anyways, it's an amazing, breathtaking and fun experience even for solo-play.

Power plays basically trigger explosions in front of you to take out your opponents. (The explosions will harm you as well if you time them poorly.) As this is a racing game, the aim is almost always to cross the finish line first.Power plays have two levels. Level 1 power plays range from simple explosions (like dropping explosive barrels on your opponents) to blowing up gas stations, planes, etc. With level 2 power plays you can blow up a bridge/dam/ship/road, or make an airplane crash land on the track and so forth. Some Level 2 power plays are also route changers which destroy part of the track thus opening up a whole new (usually faster) section while blocking the old one.The more I played, the more I realized that this game is all about timing. It really makes a difference when you trigger the various explosions or when you make that explosive barrel drop. There are also simple power plays, where you open up a door temporarily to take a shortcut. The ones behind you can get a free ride through as long as they are close enough, but once the door closes, the rest of them attempting to get through will crash.The various cars feel very different. Some of them start to drift easier, some are harder to blow up, some fills up the bar faster, etc. There are a couple of game modes too, but not all of them are playable in multiplayer.My biggest ""problem"" with this game is that there are only 11 tracks. But it has a Split/Screen mode which is a rare treat nowadays. I already had countless hours of fun playing with my friends side by side. Not that I would get tired of it any time soon, but honestly, a track editor would make this game ageless.All in all, it is insanely fun trying to avoid crashing when something just blew up near you sending your car drifting sideways while looking for the perfect moment to trigger a power play in order to beat your opponents to the finish line."

Turn poorly and draft which allows the speedhacking AI to easily overtake you as you're turning wide/slowing down.2. Not be in first place and follow someone for 10+ seconds3. Almost get him by AI traps (only way to gain power while in first place)To actually win in this game you need to tail the AI in first place and kill him right at the end using traps or expect to randomly get overtaken right before you win by an SUV that according to ingame stats is worse in every single stat comparatively to your god car.Oh, and the AI will NEVER attempt to blow each other up at all, ever. Its basically a 1v7 race where the goal of 6 of the cars is to delay you so the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in firstplace can get an impossible lead or remove all your power so you cant kill said ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.In summary its a very fun CASUAL ""blow all the cars up simulator"" i honestly cannot call this a racing game, because for it to be a racing game you would place depending on player skill, and in the single player campaign that is not how the game works.The detonation/survival/airstrike etc gamemodes are probably the most fun/repeatable features you can play in singleplayer/competitively with a friend because there isnt any AI to cheat and its argueably ""skill"" based. That is until you run into impossible airstrike patterns because the helicopter decided that the small 2lane section of racetrack right after a corner where you are is a perfect spot to drop 8+ missiles."

Because the variety comes to an end after the episodes are complete. All you do is trying to perfect the same races with same explosive options. And the gameplay is not that smooth.If you play with real people, it can be a bit more fun because humans know when to trigger events and they do not hold back. But again the clumsy gameplay kills it as you experience weird crashes.And there is a save file problem. This game has a bug that corrupts the savegame and you have to start all over.

The car handling is ok I wasn't expecting much out of it but It was fun, really fun, really really fun. The one thing I will say though is if you don't like a challenge then this is not the game for you. The computer will catch up really quickly when you are in first. I like that though it makes the races a little more challenging and I feel good when I win a race by 0.4 seconds(hence the name Split/Second).

It's HEAVILY Arcade, so if you're looking for anything remotely realistic, veer clear. There basically 2 types of cars in this game: those that take a lot of punishment and those that are fast and drift around corners. The game's career mode is split into 12 episodes, presented like TV episodes (just a very quick narration of ""this time on"" followed by some explosions. Speaking of explosions: This is the meat of the game. You will be racing against 7 opponents, blowing them up, while not getting blown up yourself. But this is no combat racer. You don't have any weapons, apart from your ""power play"" bar. You can have 3 different bars and you fill them up by drifting or drafting. Once a bar is full it can be activated at certain moments to either activate a shortcut or one of the many booby traps on a track, which consist of exploding vehicles, giant cranes, rocks, exploding barrels dropped by helicopters and so forth. Some can only be activated once, others as often as you like. This simply requires an opponent ahead of you and you timing correctly when to press the button and hoping to catch them in the detonation or blast wave. You will have to learn the tracks and their respective booby traps to be effective, since each and every one works differently. This is also where heavier vehicles have an advantage, since a blast wave doesn't knock them out as easily.The game also offers various ""landscaping"" options for each track. Once you fill 3 bars of your powerplay, it turns orange and you can cause major destruction, which results in the track being changed. Very effective if an enemy is right in front of you and gets crushed by a ship or whatever. This makes the tracks even more interesting and volatile.Apart from that there are a few different modes like Elimination (last place after x seconds is out), time trial (with explosions), Big Rig (pass trucks that bombard you with exploding barrels) and Heli Attack (evade missiles from a helicopter). Can't remember if there are any more, apart from the Elite Race at the end of each episode that you need to finish in 3rd at least I think to continue on.Each race awards you with points to unlock new vehicles. The better you place, the more points you get (not repeatable, but you can replay every race as often as you want to get 1st place if you so desire). They also unlock the next Elite Race, so technically you either don't have to do all the races or you don't have to finish 1st. Apart from that each episode contains a bonus race if you wreck enough enemies throughout that episode (repeatable in races).It's pretty much the only game that offers this gameplay as far as I know, at least the only one with halfway decent graphics even by today's standards. Also runs perfectly fine under Windows 10, just the sound is weirdly subdued for whatever reason. Can't remember if this had been the case when I played it years ago."

Any attacks on the race that hit other cars were probably meant for you and it seems like the AI can catch up to you pretty quick once you hit 1st place. This made certain races a bit frustrating. This game doesn't support online play anymore, but I think any local co-op would be more fun because then it wouldn't necessarily be all vs 1.Don't think I'd recommend it as a whole, there are probably better arcade racers out there.

Uninstalled after wasting 13 hours on an otherwise fun game.I loved this game's concept when I played the demo years ago. Thought I'd give the PC version the buy n' play.First issue was that the controller support is terribad. I managed to get it to play by rebinding the turning to the d-pad instead of the stick. Annoying, but workable.Was loving the game, thought it did get a little repetitive I noticed (some ""episodes"" are the same race as a previous episode, played off like it's something new and special. Forgivable.)The drifting mechanic took some getting used to, but in the end it was fun enough and rewarding enough for those epic neck and neck races where you just barely avoid a building exploding and a gas canister blowing up behind you and slide over the finish line in 1st place.So why is it negatively reviewed? Well, mostly for wasting 13.8 hours of my time with no resolution.See, Split Second has this fun little quirk that is quite consistant. It corrupts your save around season 5-6 out of the 12 seasons. Online no one could find a fix for it outside of being prepared ahead of time and backing up your save file repeatedly OR not stopping the game until it stops telling you the save file is corrupt.So no. I'm not dealing with this trash anymore, being my time has effectively been erased and even importing completed saves JUST so I can play through the rest of the game DOESN'T WORK. All saves are corrupted, forever. Starting over is the only option, and frankly I'm not keen on spending 10 hours replaying races (some of which I hate) using cars (most of which I hate) that perform like garbage comparatively with my progression point when the save died.One could say if the game is fun enough, why not enjoy replaying its start?No thank you. Given this is a known issue with no real fix outside of hoping it doesn't happen, I'm not gonna waste more time on this game, sadly. I'll never see its end. Uninstalling. Luckily it's small enough that if a fix does happen *hysterical laughter* I might try it again (unlikely)."

I had a crappier PC back then, and it would not run very fast (or so I thought). Having a newer PC now gave me more reason to replay this. After playing titles such as Battlefield 4, DiRT 3, Bioshock Infinite on very high graphical specs with a silky smooth framerate, I expected this game to look extra silky smooth; Boy was I wrong, the framerate is capped at 30FPS and there is noticable stutter on top of that.All in all, it is a very enjoyable racing game, I like the mechanics and I absolutely love the sound effects in the game, when you drive through tunnels, it honestly feels like the wind is rushing through your hair sometimes; albeit the immersion breaking FPS.

,Not Recommended,297860,14670793,"Posted: 26 February, 2015",all,Icarus,"This game is similar to those virtual reality arcade games from the late 90's: horrible, sticky controls, graphics all over the spectrum, and a game design that won't let you escape.When I bought this game in febuary of 2015, the reviews praised this game, and there was not one downvote on the whole site.I was aprehensive at the Disney Logo appearing upon booting up the game, because they did a very good job of not letting that slip on the store page.it just went downhill from there.the game immidiately throws you into a tutorial without further explination. as it teaches you to drive, it rattles off the game's interpretation on a tired, cliche plot. (Smash T.V , anyone?)an additional note; the game's default key mapping uses the arrow keys, which i find horrid. not only that, but it also disables the mouse. good luck learning how to navigate the 80 billion menus with your puny little arrow keys.anyway, so it takes you around the track at least twice. my indifinitiveness is based on the fact that i did not complete the tutorial. the game called for a key i did not have access to, and so i had to abort the tutorial. good thing you CAN NEVER GO BACK TO IT AGAIN.So, once I left the tutorial, I was greeted with a menu that is cut-and-pasted out of Ridge Racer. Now, I dont know which came out first, but considering the impression R Racer had left on me, my confidince in the game was dropping like Seattle's Space Needle in level 2. But I'm getting ahead of myself.The game comes with this 'revolutionary' autosave feature, that can identify when something has changed or not. not very well, i might add. the autosave means that you get 0 feedback from the menus, which resulted in me having to restart the first race 4 times to get my key mapping saved.when you enter the race (after 4 or 5 more menus, at least), you get a few vehicle options. a muscle car with poor acceleration, a truck with poor acceleration, or a lamborghini bootleg thats faster than hell but is made out of balsa wood. you can guerentee getting destroyed at least 3 times on the first lap.as soon as you start the race (two more menus later), something becomes painfully obvious. three-second cutscenes are the latest, greatest thing (or thats what the developers thought). This game has these tiny cut scenes everywhere, and they rapidly begin to get old. but thats not the irritating thing. You cant skip these Random-camera-angle anthologies. instead, pushing 'enter' or 'space' will bring up the pause menu. that means instead of skipping some pointless Replay, you may restart the race, or even exit to the main menu unintentionally.So you say to yourself; ""ok. i can put up with annoying game design. but how is the control?""think of it this way:every car is a mercedesIf you have never driven a mercedes, all i am saying is the car control is as floaty as a cheap balloon puppy from a B- list clown. you slide all over the place when you drive, so much so that its actually a mechanic. I am sure they only incorperated 'Drifting' into the game to overcome the top-heavy, tractionless vehicles. its bad enough as is, but the steering is even worse. it seems to me that steering was programmed at one tragectory, and if you're going too slow or too fast, steering is going to feel extremely heavy. so if you come to a stop, consider the race over, because even tapping to go left will drag your car all the way to one side, preventing you from going straight.For the finale, lets talk about the focus of the game, because half of you out there own it just because you saw explosions on the thumbnail.yes, there are explosions, and for the most part, it is very satisfing to see chunks of flaming metal rip apart the opposing cars. even the trigger mechanic works well, allowing some challenge timing-wise while not becoming frustrating. the only mechanic that doesnt work well is the indication on what IS blowing up. in fact, there is none. you'll trigger an explosion, and for 2 seconds blue text will tell you you did just that. but it wont tell you where it is, or how big, which can often lead to you blowing yourself up. in addition, being in first place leaves you nearly defenceless, because it is nearly impossible to target backwards and drive forwards."

,Not Recommended,297860,12483030,"Posted: 13 October, 2014",all,Jet Uppercut,"Split/Second is a racing game. Or at least that's what it's creators would like you to believe.I affectionately call these titles 'modern' racing games, because they have very little do with racing or playing a game.It's more like watching a movie while you steer a brick of lead with soap wheels through a QTE filled landscape of different shades of brown rubble.Unlike most other racing games, skill plays almost no part in whether or not you win a race. The AI rubber bands to an incredible degree and seems to only ever target you with Powerplays, meaning opening up the alternate routes while you're in the lead is a terrible idea, since it just gives the AI more ammo to fire at you.The pace of the game is barely above a crawl, with the difference between the 1-Speed cars and the 5-Speed cars being almost negligible. I never bothered unlocking anything higher. Drifting also serves to slow this down even more, so if you hope to win any races, don't let go of the accelerator ever. Not that you would really need to.You often have nothing to do with the Power you accumulate while in the lead. You can't activate Powerplays that are behind you or boost. Often just leaving you a sitting duck.The powerplays themselves range from explosions to bigger explosions. Sometimes you can activate shortcuts but usually the game won't let you. I assume this has to do with this game's overarching theme of punishing you for being too good at it.You'll often find yourself in first place, sailing 5 seconds ahead of the rest of the pack for them to fly past you at warp speed 300 feet before the finish line to just immediately slow to a crawl. However if you smash into walls the entire race, hang back and draft to activate Powerplays and are sitting in 2nd or 3rd before the finish, you'll usually win. The Air Strike mode also has an amusing tendency to decide you're going 'too slow' around a hairpin corner and just fire a salvo of missiles at you.The Elite Races are just races where you go up against cars that are much better than yours. While the expectation is that you'll come back to these races later with a faster car, I was often able to beat them on the first or second try. I had enough series points that I was unlocking the next elite race immediately after finishing the last one, which just shows how poor the pacing in this game really is.Overall, I would say that this game doesn't even manage to make it's own gimmick, literally being that you are playing a stunt driver in a TV show, interesting or engaging. The recurring set pieces and genuinely horrible AI make for an uninteresting and uninspired racing game lacking any substance, but much of the flair we have come to expect from say, a Michael Bay movie or a McDonald's Cheeseburger.The fact that this game influenced an entire genre to effectively commit suicide by copying it's sluggish gameplay, brown city environments and severe lack of speed is shocking. Thank the Indies that we have games like Drift Stage and 90s Arcade Racer to look forward to."

The camera motion behind the car helps with that.I fully recomend this game for £14.99 any cheaper it's a bargain!

The worst part is it is close to impossible to beat this game with skill you probably need to get a faster car to actually get first in the normal races let alone the elite races, and let me tell you i have the best car unlocked so far and its doing jackshit for me.So TL;DR, get it if you want to get frustrated out of your mind but for a fun experience when you are actually racing on equal footing"

Got it again right before the Lunar Sale ended for feels.Wasnt expecting a 30fps cap, at that point I don't see much of a difference between playing this on console or PC. Not that I can't just hook up a 360 controller (provided it actually supports it anyway), but I had forgotten the different races this had during the Season game mode. I abhor elimination and whichever one deals with those damn trucks and barrels.I don't feel like reliving that rage, though ultimately I would recommend this to anyone wanting a fast pace racing game that looks good and has nukes going off every 5 seconds."

This on the other hand adds a new twist to the regular racing, which is dodgeing falling building and exploding cars and barrels that get hurled at you while you are trying to be the very best.Simple mechanics, graphics that still look great and it's made by...Disney.If all disney games were made like this, i'm in.Only bad thing i have to say is that the could have been more maps available and unfortunately the online play is simply dead. most likely for the lack of players. (By dead i not only mean no one playing but the servers for it are not there anymore, hence making it impossible to play online)But if you got 2 controllers and a mate, go at it from home, splitscreen style"

What makes it unique is racer's ability to alter the track, usually with help of explosives. Besides great music, responsive controls and various race modes, this game also features quite a unique presentation - every race is a part of an episode. which is a part of a season of a reality show. All in all, a great racing game that not a lot of people know of."

The cars are all beautifull. Now for the bad part. The game is has no support for high end textures and no support for anti aliasting. The dev studio was shut down soon after launch so if you wish to play multiplayer, you will need to join a steam group to do so. The game is locked to 30fps but this can be undone if you follow my guide on how to unlock 60fps. All things considered, I would definetly reccomend this game if it was to go on sale!"
,Recommended,297860,33333017,Posted: 6 July,all,Desp,"Split Second is an exhilariating and acessible racing game, probably my favorite. The adjective acessible is important because this is both its greatest feature and its worst flaw - the seamless racing mechanics lack depth, which means it's very easy to pick up by players with varying levels of experience, but may be boring for those who prefer more advanced racing games. The core mechanic that sets this apart from any other racing game, which allows you to trigger explosions throughout the map in order to wreck your opponets, is executed flawlessly and ensures this will be a game you return to time and time again. A lot of fun for those who want a simplified, yet adreneline-packed racing game."
