76561198030788488,Recommended,297920,32799272,Posted: 25 June,all,Cracktus Jack,"Space Colony – Steam Editionis an sci-fi colony tycoon game. Manage your colony on alien planets and cater to your crew's needs while at the whim of corporate headquarter's greed.Pros: The return of a classic! Manage power and oxygen levels in your base as you expand it with a series of domes and corridors in which to place sleeping quarters, health and hygiene pods, maintenance equipment, feeding stations and a large variety of entertainment facilities. Outside your base, you must construct and man various farming and mining stations for resources you will then sell or make use of to continue to expand. The fun, and challenge, are in the characters: you get a wacky assortment of crew members, each with their own personality quirks and expertise, and you'll need to maintain their needs, motivation and relationship to one another, lest they lose productivity or go straight out crazy. The campaign is a great set of challenges where you must achieve specific goals of increasing difficulty on different planets, facing the alien fauna and environment while bending to Blackwater Industries' goals and profit  deadlines. The larger your colony gets, the harder it is to keep a delicate balance of work and pleasure with your crew members while keeping your colony at peak efficiency. It's not the ""Sims in Space"" some people claim it to be, but fun nevertheless!Cons: The humor in the game, while charming at first, quickly gets put aside as the game focuses more and more about timing the various tasks you give your colonists, and less about the actual building of your colony. The clock that determines your crew members' work and leasure time is constantly cancelling tasks you're giving them: just as you decide to send someone to sleep, eat or do anything, your order gets overriden before they even reach their desired location because their shift starts or ends, which is very irritating when trying to time the actions of more and more crew members. Some of the controls are annoying, such as needing to unselect a character before selecting another one, or accidentally giving them a job when you were just trying to get them to a location. The freeplay option gets repetitive quickly, as having access to every items without a clear set of goals makes building your base less interesting.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!I was glad to see this gem pop up on Steam! While graphics and animations show their age, it's just as good now as it was back then. If you enjoy a tycoon game of medium depth with a time management-focused challenge, I strongly recommend it!P.S.: The Steam Workshop is a total disappointment. While there's a mere few exceptions, most are bogus Mods created just to get the ""Publish a mission to the workshop"" achievement, the rest are huge fields of crop/minerals specifically designed for the various ""Harvest X amount"" achievements. Such lazy Mods are why so many games usually disable achievements when Mods are enabled.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated)reviews."

Thankfully they didn't 'improve' on it too much and kept all the story line and quirky humor the same.  They have however improved on the graphics enough to bring it up to date and now that it's on steam it will be more fun to make custom maps and scenarios to share with other people on here...we just have to wait for someone to start doing that and I'll be getting on with mines shortly too :PAll in all, a great game to play for both new and returning players of Space Colony.

The operatives themselves being slaves to their bank, and the corporation running the galaxy, Blackwater Industries.  Blackwater industries will not often provide you with much to complete this task, and chaos often ensues.There are social aspects, as well as plenty of RTS combat.  Luckily there is a pause button, you'll need it."

The crew has needs to be tended to but that goes for the most part on auto pilot.In this game you build up a corporate colony. Build resourcers, beds, chairs and laserturrets.You can put a shower room right in the middle of the colony hub and not one single crew member will care. Sauna next to the prisson? Not a problem. Counseling bot next to the dance floor? That can be arranged.In the campain mode, you start off with a small colony which you have to expand. At first it looks like you can't scroll across the screen, but thats only because the area around the base hasn't been explored with lights yet.After the first 5 or 6 mission you split off into two paths: a peaceful path and a war path.The missions can be pretty severe and even the peace route can be pretty violent. The first time i tried the peace route, my base got overrun with aliens and my entire crew got killed. I was then congratulated by the corporation for killing off my crew without having a mutiny, they were impressed. Haven't tried the war path yet and i think my crew won't survive that one either.Pro- good ol' fashioned building construction.- Shooting furry aliens- Somewhat dark sense of humor- Sims-light in space.- During the campaign, your entire base will be carried over as long as you play missions on the same planet.Con- Due to being an older game it has no zoom function. Can get irritating at times.- Iff an important crew member dies, it's basicly game over for the campaign.- TammyRating. 7/10 Would shoot hordes of small furry aliens again."

At the heart of it though is still the same game with the same flaws. You still can't rotate objects, you can't zoom in/out on the map, there's only two speeds (normal and turbo), and there's lots of actions to be done but none of it can be queued. The selection of buildings and decorations is rather basic and graphics are by today's standards, quite dated.However, when you get right down to gameplay and working with this group of highly dysfunctional misfits, Space Colony really comes to life. Keeping them sane and happy is no small task, plus romance can spring up amongst colonists in the most unlikely of places.It might be an older game, but I still recommend it."

It is still a great game with plenty to do, as well as loads of interesting features. From mining resources to manufacture things with and trade, all the way up to trying to get members of your staff to have lesbian sex.I'd give this one a 7.5 of 10, or 8.5 out of 10 if you want to take into account that it is a few years old."

76561197994381906,Recommended,297920,22394824,"Posted: 13 April, 2016",all,diotialate,"Space Colony is a casual overhead city-builder with both sandbox and campaign modes. Once one of the best games for the Macintosh, Space Colony is constantly referred to as ""The Sims"" in space. You play as god, moving around a dozenish people to improve their relationships with one another, limited in pace by an economy of space mining and farming.  The best part is the voice acting, as the quirks of each character bring out light comedy to keep you entertained for hours. These quirks will have you build different entertainment venues for each character, to maximize the benefits of each worker's work.  Or maybe you won't, because some characters are pretty useless.  This combination of micromanagement and macromanagement is far from tedious.The Steam adaptation of it has some flaws.  Modern day computers have bigger and HD screens so, the field of view is widened and the buttons are smaller.  This doesn't interfere with gameplay.  There's some problems with audio balance for some sound effects. Alt+tab (switching windows) crashes Space Colony.  I still think this is forgivable, and I'd be willing to give the game 5/5 stars.Well-done, 5 stars."
76561198146687992,Recommended,297920,22547416,"Posted: 21 April, 2016",all,kespeppercorn,"I really like this game. It has been described as The Sims in Space. I have never liked The Sims games as I find that they are far too repetitive and boring. Space Colony is a good building game, The Sims element is that you do have to be aware of the needs of your operatives to improve production. This does give an extra twist to the game that you have to think about and some of the challenges are based around ensuring that your crew are reletively happy or they won't work.Any Building Sim worth it's salt should have an element of ensuring that you are providing basic things, such as food, so I don't find this particularly strange, as some have mentioned. Making sure your crew does not go mad while on an abandoned planet does give the game an additional challenge.The object of most of the challenges is to produce as much money or supplies as possible. Each crew member has his/her own specialism so the object of the game is to mangage your crew to get the highest productivity while protecting the base from space monsters.There does appear to be a few bugs, that I noticed. I have found that if you save your progress regularly, then when you encounter a bug re-load your progress and the bug goes away. The bugs do appear to be based around not recognising your progress. I also had an extractor that wasn't being recognised by the supply depot. These are all really small bugs which don't hinder game enjoyment but may mean loss in some progress if you don't save.I would put it in the same category as games like Dungeon Keeper or War for the overworld.Have fun building and watch out for the protoraptors, they are tougher then they look!"

The original may be from 2003, but it plays like games from the 90's with similar charm and quirkiness: Theme Hospital immediately comes to mind, for example.In a similar vein to Theme Hospital, a lot of the basics become a bit monotonous (once you've built one corridor, you've built them all), but there are enough new building types and scenario objectives to keep it interesting. There's a whole host of things to do too, ranging from harvesting crops to mining, keeping bugs at bay and cleaning up a dirty station, treating injured colonists, having them sit down at a restaurant...you get the idea, it's a long list.What really makes the game, for me, are the characters.They each have quirky phrases and character interactions, and can go from totally satisfied in a relationship to stir-crazy and requiring detention to calm them down pretty rapidly without the correct needs satisfied - the most obvious one being human interaction. They die if not looked after, have audible banter when they bump into each other, moan when things aren't going well...it's fun to work out how to achieve the objectives of a new mission, but far more so to try out the new characters as they appear in your base."

The difficulty and replayability is there because while you might learn the game it will never be repetitive.The characters feel like my friends, after spending hours together I will still laugh at some of their lines.I got this game as a long time firefly fan, having never played the game before (published 2003). Even today with amazing computers, this game is pretty addicting. Like other firefly games it comes with a creation kit to make, share and play your own maps and assets. I spent about 10 hours figuring out how to play and all the nuances of the game. The sandbox for me is the most fun but some of the maps are really difficult. In every strategy (on some of the hardest difficulty worlds) I would fail. *queue creation kit* Now I have 5 more maps, which I created at just the perfect difficulty.Biggest consLimited items, orientations (can't rotate items) and general customizing options available to build your base. There are probably only 120 items in the entire game that create your world. That gets kindof old.All in all it's a good classic game with at least 20 hours of fun in it. :weed:"

Beware though, dispite its innocent appearance, some of the missions can be brutally difficult. Expect to fail a few times and take more than a few casualties."

I never had to face the aliens, but if I did, I feel like I would of been in deep, due to the fact I have to juggle the tiniest problems delicately.I wouldnt recommend this game unless your into macromanagement.

This classic is essentially that; only with an aspect of danger and narritave progression added in.

But there can only really be one true Space Colony; and it is back.Note:The HD edition adds widescreen support, higer resolutions, improved stability on newer systems and new mini campaigns.The Steam edition adds all of the above, plus a further new mini campaign and Steam Workshop support.My advice: If you've got the HD edition, you don't really need to splurge cash on the Steam edition unless you have plenty of spare money lying around. If you've got the original Space Colony or are buying for the first time, you will want the Steam edition. The Steam edition is also the most likely to get further updates as it is considered to be the definitive version by the devs."

It feels a little rough around the edges, as far as UI design, but I was able to find everything I needed and got used to the controls eventually.The game's style (humorous, cartoonish) is well implemented and consistent. The only problem I had was that it was nearly impossible to understand half of what the character Stig said, due to his incredibly heavy accent. But that was rarely a significant problem.The AI was good enough that it didn't feel like I was taking care of helpless infants, so I could instead keep track of a general view of the colony and send people to do what was most needed, which a good sim/management game should do.It isn't the best sim/management game I've ever played, but it does a good job, and I'll enjoy slowly getting all of the achivements over time."

ALthough with more focused goals to which you must manage your charges towards. ALso, your playthings have rather well fleshed out quirks and personalities and lettiung them die is a bad thing since, well you kinda need them to run your base.I won't do my usual pros and cons thing because really, for this type of game, you already knew what they were if you were even tangentally aware of the Sims.. SO I'll just bounce to the summary..ahem...THe game holds up well and while the interface is somewhat confusing and unhelpful, it's really not a bad little game. You will easily find at least one or two colonists you like and a few that you outright hate (Tammi).  All in all, a challenging game best enjoyed in small bites. Give it a try and you won't regret it."

Ultimately what kills the appeal is the failure to develop a cohesive storyline. I played the first ""set"" of the story campaign, and it ended briefly without any real conclusion - heck, the drive for the characters was about as vague as it gets. I could not understand why I suddenly had to choose between a military or civilian path; nothing in the first campaign even hinted at this dichotomy nor helped me understand what each path meant. There is no real backstory on the characters, but I kept hoping for something more. I wanted to keep them alive, but only because I had spent time building them into a team... then I find that none of them stick around except for the main character who was just about as cookie-cutter as the rest of them. I don't care about multiplayer, and getting interrupted only gave me pause to ask whether I even cared to keep playing... and sadly this game fails to keep me interested enough for more."

Having played games like StarTopia, The Spatials, and games in the similar vein, I was unimpressed by the way this game handles station personnel and security.In one mission you run into these space rats and can't get rid of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s because you can't shoot at them. I went into freeplay and could not find a way to get rid of them there either. There's no hint or anything on how to get rid of them, but they muck up your base and keep you from putting down new buildings or items. They also make the worst noise ever.Then there's the plantlife which will swoop in and destroy your buildings, wasps that attack your stuff, and through all this you have these Sims-like idiots complaining you haven't given them the right assortment of furniture to keep them happy, so they stop doing their jobs, and your colony falls to pieces.The placement of items is sometimes not as clear as it should be, you are led through the most linear storyline I've seen in these games in a while (the only choice being whether you want to focus on a tactical or economics campaign fork), and even when you try to think tactically and plan things out, while you're trying to place items their visual representation does not align with how you think they align and you end up placing them several blocks away from where you wanted them to be.Overall it quickly gets more annoying than fun, and here I thought games were supposed to be fun..."

Plus, it'll crash sometimes if you alt-tab in and out of the game.It's fun and challenging, but the lack of quality-of-life features just drag it down. The base-building aspect feels nice and complex, but it's incredibly annoying to have to deal with the relationship mechanic between colonists. This isn't optional either: unhappy colonists work for less time, move slower and even destroy your own base assets in a worst-case scenario. When every other colonist need in the game is handled automatically, why couldn't this one be?Incredibly missed potential, especially considering the lack of games in this niche genre."
