It's not the voice over, which is tolerable. It's the art. What is the point of a hidden object game if the picture is so badly drawn and blurry that all you have is not more than pure luck to find something?!Do not buy this."

Its basicly a ""find the hidden objects"" game with some puzzles that mostly involve ""finding hidden objects"".  The graphics suck, pictures of objects have just been stuck onto a background picture and everything looks out of place, like a jumble of pictures cut from a magazine thrown into a pile.  The story also does not work, you are finding objects in order to preserve the musuems collection... yet most of the objects you are locating are cigarete lighters, sunglasses, wallets and ID cards... then in the 'puzzle' rooms you feed old copper coins (that are aparantly attracted to magnets) into a vending machine and use an ancient sword to break a concrete pillar so it topples and smashes its way through a wall.... So much for preserving the collection, also what are you doing with all this stuff??? you dont have a bag visible in any of the cut scenes.  You also locate a CB radio and pull the batteries out of it to power a torch... then you immediatly use it to talk to somebody???  So to sum up, bad graphics that make most objects unfindable and a bad plot that cant justify 90% of the things you have to do in order to progress."

This game does not do that.Firstly it is incedibly low res. It then compounds this by using really awful pictures of the things you have to find, occasionally misspelling them, sometimes hiding them behind bits of the UI so there is no possible way you can find them and of course when you finally give in and click that hint button you'll end up staring at some grainy blur going really? I was meant to identify that as... something??There is some initial urgency in the storyline as you have been separated from your daughter but this is soon leached out of the game by it offering you the chance to amble back through rooms you've already been through recovering more objects.It does keep track of your accuracy rate and offer percentage completion as you work your way through the game, and some of the ""escape the room"" type puzzles are semi engaging. The problem really is that there are better games out there. Even if you see it in a bundle or with a massive discount... just don't. Really, I have seldom met a hidden object game this annoying or frustrating and for all the wrong reasons."
,Not Recommended,298020,10871372,"Posted: 27 June, 2014",all,tehkella,"Terrible hidden object game - some items were oddly-named and most were extremely difficult to see due to soft blended graphics and often being partially or almost wholly obscured (sometimes by the game's toolbar!)The click targets for the items were extremely small and given the game has an accuracy meter, this can be extremely frustrating (and as it turned out, was completely unnecessary as getting 10% accuracy as opposed to 100% accuracy differed not at all to the outcome).Also a ridiculous premise: no one comes to help you except your inept husband, and all the while you are searching for your child, your boss gives you a list of valuable artifacts to collect along the way such as bowling pins, buttons and other random junk.Was glad when it was over."
,Not Recommended,298020,9982451,"Posted: 30 April, 2014",all,rev silverspine,"Even at 90% off this title isn't worth even looking at.It's a crummy mobile port with next to no options menu (windowed/fullscreen and volume control is all you get), at a 4:3 aspect ratio. The artwork may be decent, but it does not excuse the poor overall quality of the game.The plot is weak and makes no sense most of the time (You're a mother trying to get to her child in a room that seems to be on the other side of the planet and you take your time to save ""artefacts"" that make no sense: glasses, a floppy disk, a stamp - worth like $1.7k?, and other nonsensical junk that, in a real situation, would just encumber you in your quest).The voice acting is decent-ish, but the sound levels vary far too much.The mechanics are boring and borderline idiotic, but may be suitable for a child of about 5, since it's just a matter of ""find X in pile of junk and use on item Y"" with no actual challenge to it.It's clearly a case of ""Let's publish a 6-year-old game on Steam so we can milk some more money from it"" (if you'll research it, you'll find that it is available on multiple platforms, including Wii and mobile, on iTunes, and it is also available as a flash game).Definitely a game you should avoid. You're better off buying Syberia 1/2 or Broken Sword 1/2/3/5."
,Not Recommended,298020,16895993,"Posted: 5 July, 2015",all,Caspian Roach,"This hidden object game commits the greatest crime of the genre — it sometimes has multiple objects with the same name on the screen, but only one of them is 'the right one' and is clickable.And it's 800x600 and has an allergy for 16:10 monitors, refusing to launch fullscreen outright.There are better examples of the genre elsewhere."
,Recommended,298020,13197566,"Posted: 2 December, 2014",all,talgaby,"Short version: 51%A very innovative hidden object game with a fun and immersive storyline that is sadly ruined by horrible visual representation, significantly hurting playability.Long version:Escape the Museum has almost every ingredients to make it a memorable and fun hidden object title; it features lots of scenes, including a rarely used HO type, problem solving screens (where you have to find and use objects to progress, almost like a one-screen point-and-click game).The storyline is simple, but works well: you are trapped in a museum after an earthquake, and slowly work your way to freedom. There are lots of small cutscenes and the voice acting is well done.But all of this is ruined by one thing: the graphics are terrible. The rooms are overcrowded, and combined with the low resolution and the dial-in era level of JPEG compression it’s impossible to recognise anything. It’s a shame, but I had to resort to a rapid clicker program to pass most of the scenes.Still, if you don’t mind the bad visuals, the game is worth it for the storyline, which is continued in the superior sequel, Adventure Chronicles."
,Not Recommended,298020,14844018,"Posted: 11 March, 2015",all,FilledwithStraw,"This is more 'Meh' than negative. What the game has going for it is that it's pretty long to complete. There's side rooms you can do and different styles of hidden object games to play.What sucks is that the pictures are all super low resolution and are just poorly put together. I got stuck in one spot, clicked hint, and the item I needed to click on was actually behind the menu button on the HUD so I couldn't click it (or see it) and I had to cancel out of the game and restart so that it would give me a different set of things to find.The voice acting is pretty dismal and the story is just okay. But the main draw of HOGs is the actual hidden objects, and this just doesn't do that well at all."
,Not Recommended,298020,12734701,"Posted: 1 November, 2014",all,flashwitt,"""Cannot find a working resolution for this computer"" SERIOUSLY? So it forces you into a TINY windowed mode, then expects you to find almost microscopic objects in hidden object puzzles. Wretched. Not worth the 99 cents I spent. No, I do NOT recommend it."
,Not Recommended,298020,9982794,"Posted: 30 April, 2014",all,*P0P$*FR3$H3NM3Y3R*,"I got this game very cheap so i thought i might just give it a go but I didnt even make it past 5 minutes into it. If the actual hidden object/ puzzle gameplay may or may not be  fun i can't actually tell.  The problem with the game is that its extremely dated, tho the store page says it was from 2008, but it just feels like 15 years older. That wouldnt be much of a problem but since the game runs in 800x600 or 640X480, the visual quality is so obstructive that its nearly unplayable. In fullscreen mode all the stuff looks blurred and pixelated, i's practicly impossible to read the text boxes. The fonts have no hinting and the interpolation just messes the whole text up. (I would link a screenshot but this games doesnt support steam overlay)The objects are hard to see for that same matter...i could let this go by as extra challenge tho...still sub par.When in windowed mode (the only graphics option in the menu) the game is at its native resolution and theres no scaling option, this means that on a normal hd monitor that window is freakin small, good luck reading the text or finding the objects now.I assume these hidden object games kinda appeal to casual gamers like your average Mom and Pop type, however with these interface and readability issues that game certainly disqualifies itself.It's a poor rerelase/ port or whatever, they  should at least include some scaling option and probably try to work improving the lousy resolution.I'd definetly NOT recommend this game, not even to fans of the genre."

If you are big fan of HO games then this can be good.

It can also serve as an example for the Dont's in game design.There are, at first, the puzzles. Simple as they are, everytime you start, an SMS very nearly tells you how to solve it. ""A dinosaur head is blocking the exit! If you can find some rope, maybe you can use that pulley to lift it up?""""The security system locked the gate! Go find a liquid to make it short-circuit.""Once you did that, you get a call: We need you to save some prizeless artifacts from the destroyed museum, so go retrieve a watch, a knife, and a wallet. Don't mind the Mona Lisa in the corner! Also, to retrieve these objects, you need to look closely at a badly photoshopped picture full of all the stock images the developers could get their hands on. And again, the picture quality is so low you can't tell if that's a sea shell or a really ugly bag.Then there's the picture puzzles. ""The earthquake destroyed some pictures, so please piece them back together. Also, they're so low-res you can't tell the picture from the holes in the picture.""...yeah, that about sums it up. Don't get this game.Just don't."

Wouldn't even want to try on a smaller monitor. Paid $1.25 for the game and I don't think it's worth that. Of course I'm outside of the 2 week refund period. Ugh... I guess I need to make it a habit to check out any games I buy right away instead of buying a bunch of them during sales and then playing them down the road. Not sure if I'll try to finish this game yet, 1/2 hour of gameplay was exhausting having to squint to try and find objects. So maybe 1/2 hour per day?"

,Recommended,298020,16237459,"Posted: 7 June, 2015",all,Mad Lucie,"This is a very fun, enjoyable , if fairly easy  hidden object and puzzle game with a smart, strong female maun character.  It has an engaging story that moves you through the different puzzles. I found the hidden object puzzles fairly challlenging, most of the others quite easy, but mostly fun. If you are looking for a relaxing, fun, few hours without a lot of risk-taking or decision-making with conserquences, while taking part in an exciting storyline, or an exciting game to play along with a child, this is a great game for you!Pros: very simple interface, easy to understand puzzles and game progression, good story, rated E, strong female characters, non-violent.Cons: Extremely Easy, exccept for the blasted hidden objects, if you are too vain to wear glasses <looks at ceiling whistling innocently>...10 of 10 (for a family-friendly game ^^)Looking forward to playing the sequel!"

,Recommended,298020,29140501,Posted: 9 January,all,Crunch,"Recommended only for those who aren't frustrated by poor graphics. If you need everything to be perfectly clear and visible, stay away from this one.According to the in-game stats, I completed the game in 6.1 hours at 96% accuracy. Little hint if you want to get 100% accuracy: the mouse pointer pulses when you are hovering over the correct item so let it hover for a second if you aren't sure you found the correct thing, then click only if it pulses.I used 3 hints. One was at the very top of the screen 99% hidden by the user interface, almost unclickable. The other two were dark item on dark background kind of things that I had a great deal of trouble seeing even after using the hints.This is an old title. Plays at 800x600 so don't expect to be able to clearly see all the things. The really small items are just blurry blobs.The story is ok, tho I have to wonder at a woman who stops to collect 'treasures' while trying to get to her daughter after an earthquake, even if it is her job. I also have to wonder at her bosses definition of 'treasure'.I turned off both the music and the voice, so I cannot say if they were any good or not.I did enjoy the challenge, but I will likely not be playing again."
