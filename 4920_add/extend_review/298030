I'll try to make this short and sweet.This particular version of the game:+Includes both of the expansion packs. The description doesn't mention it, but both Core Contingency and Battle Tactics are here.+Includes the map editor.+Supports resolutions up to 1920x1200, though I find that the game looks and plays better after bumping it down a few notches.+Seems to run perfectly on Windows 10.+Is good old version 3.1, combatible with countless fan-made maps and mods. There are probably thousands of extra units available to add on to this game, though the game has a cap of allowing ~230 custom additional units to be installed at one time.-Does not include any updated multiplayer lobbies or functionalty.-Does not currently support the Steam overlay.If you're not familiar with the game itself, go read a real review.

Looking back to the late 90s and the technology available then, this game was amazingly advanced and did many things that weren't at all common then. Many common RTS elements that are expected in a game released today can be seen in their youth in TA. The order queuing system, the streaming resource and building systems, the diversity of units and asymmetrical factions are all key features that were later used in practically every RTS since. You can clearly see the foundation of Supreme Commander especially. There are aspects of TA that still haven’t been matched, such as the unit diversity: Air, Land, Sea, Seaplane, Hovercraft, Amphibious.Like artillery? How about the Intimidator, which can fire halfway across the map? Too slow? Build the Buzzsaw: a giant rotary cannon made up of Intimidators that fires as fast as a machine gun and will drain your energy economy in seconds. Yes, it IS the most entertaining gun ever!The music of TA is the best orchestral soundtrack ever made for a game. I still sometimes listen to the ""battle"" tracks in my car. I turn the music off in every other game I’ve played and listen to “real” music instead (I remember listening to Spice Girls on a CD while playing), but TA got to keep its soundtrack.I think a large part of what made TA such a fun and long lasting experience was the modding community. I remember spending as much time finding, downloading (V.90 modem, yo), and figuring out conflicts between mods as playing the game, but those mods extended the diversity and playability of the game so extensively that there are still active players AND active modders for TA. You don’t see that with too many 19 year-old games.The chief contender for the RTS throne was Starcraft, which was released right around the same time as TA, and went on to define the ""twitch"" RTS subgenre. Coming from Warcraft 2, I remember buying both games, and being rather disappointed in Starcraft, since it seemed to me to be ""Warcraft in space"". TA was something entirely new and captured that certain something that makes it a gaming classic... and I've probably spent more time in this game than any other, ever."

The best way I can descrbe it would be to think of Skyrim without mods, then think of Skyrim with mods that's effectively TA in a nuthshell.Options:+ The developers certainly had longevity in mind, you can adjust the resolution up to 1920 x 1080.+ Provides all the options you might expect from a game of this age, perhaps abit more.- On/Off only, you can't find a middle ground without adjusting the files directly.Gameplay+ A map for everybody! - every map has something for everybody the metal maps provide infinite resources and lead to a fast-paced style game. In contrast low metal maps have you fighting over resources while slowly pushing your way into the enemy base. Maps on distant moons have you transporting units by air over impassable chasms or bombing your opponent into the dust.+ Play how you want - Many RTS games have a 'defined' stratergy TA has no such definition, you will encounter players who love the good old peepee rush or those whose sole purpose is to watch you squirm as they destroy your outlying extractors. You'll encounter the turtles naturally but the game provides you with all the nessesary tools to enact your stratergy and descimate others.- AI Pathfinding - As mentioned the pathfinding is horrible and will almost certainly require fixing especially if you want to play Skirmish thankfully their are mods and simple scripts to fix this.- Performance - Most modern day PC's won't have a problem until like Skyrim you hit a point where your computer begins to chug along. This tends to arise from heavily modded games especially when you start to up the unit cap from 200 to 1000+Community:+ Still going strong not much else to say here besides the fact you have over 10 years of mods to discover some of which have been developed over so many years."

It's the only accurate game I've ever seen about our future, where humans are all dead and the arm clones fight the core planetary mind for control of the universe.  They don't even care about being alive or anything, they just want to annihilate the other side so so much.  Sometimes a battle can take like 8 hours and just grind on, it takes so much willpower to keep going, or to even notice when you get nuked.  It's an endless battle.  It also has a great soundtrack written by Jeremy Seole, who wrote a lot of the music in Secret of Evermore.  The first time I saw Total Annihilation, I was in Circuit City and I saw this cool looking guy getting bombed by 50 fast moving fighters and planes and he couldn't stop the computer from killing him and he eventually lost his commander and then his last towers and the map went grey.  It was like 1997 or something and he must have been horrible at the game and I don't think either of us bought anything from circuit city that day, but to see that cool guy get annihilated by an endless wave of planes was shocking to me.  He said ""damn it"" or something like that and then looked at his watch and said ""oh no"" and then he ran away, I guess he had to go somewhere and was late.  I saw it as a great challenge to become as good as he was some day, and I still feel like I'm not, but objectively I must have met that challenge because I have won wars against 10 computer players with population limits in the thousands.  If I could go back in time, I would go back there, ask him if i could help, and save his base."

There is a very good reason this game was 1997 game of the year and it wore that badge proudly on the sales box. So jump on board, I have hours of child hood that have NOT been wasted to prove how great Total Annihilation truly is.If you liked Supreme Commander and/or Planetary Annihilation, I would highly recomend you check out the game that started it all. While it might seem a little dated, even to this day, it is still quite impressive. You see, this game was a first to do a lot of things. A true innovator. Not to mention the fantastic soundtrack, still being one of the best ever thanks to Jeremy Soule.You should note that this download does come with both expansion packs: Battle Tactics and The Core Contingency. This is great news as the expansions have not worked on Windows without some kind of emulation since XP. I myself can finaly battle with a Krogoth, something I've not done for 7 odd years.Most people buying and downloading this game have probably already played it, so I will spare it a rating breakdown, though it would be just about perfect score. Instead I will point out a couple bugs that I've been getting so far. I will edit this review with fixes as they come along. Feel free to comment for patches, fixes, whatnots.-Everytime game launches it squishes all my windows desktop icons together.-Will tab out of game to windows desktop whenever a new screen is loaded in game. Game doesn't crash though, so that if mostly fine.-Can't side scroll at a widescreen resolution. Also not turly an issue in my mind, just changed the resolution to 1024x600-Sometimes construction units will drop their shift queues.-Seems like Steam Overlay might not be compatible?Other than that the game is still the masterpiece that it always has been and the under $4 asking price is chump coin.

,Recommended,298030,30588321,Posted: 18 March,all,Lewisse,"TL;DR: Buy this. It's worth it.Total Annihilation.Damn.This game was my childhood. I remember sitting on my Dad's lap and we'd build up our army together and then nuke the CORE to pieces. Those were the days.Total Annihilation is a Real-Time Strategy game. You start off with one 'Unit', your Commander, and slowly build up your army of planes, vehicles, mechs, boats, hovercraft, etc. For a game that is 20 years old this year this is STILL in my opinion the greatest RTS game of all time. This is the type of game that despite the graphics being massively outdated, and only 1.1GB big (not even that), it's still feels full of content. The maps are HUGE and there's lots of variety. The Units all have their own jobs and characteristics. There's a campaign too, and also, if you can figure out how to get it to work, a multiplayer. At the time of writing this review it only says I have 2.1 hours on record, but to be truthful I probably have hundereds outside of Steam. This game is truly one of my favourite games of all time and I HIGHLY reccomend it to anybody who's into the Supreme Commander series. This is similar to Planetary Annihilation in that it was made by a few of the same people, but from what I've heard from Planetary Annihilation, despite being more modern, better in graphical design and including much more content, THIS is the game you want. Trust me.Thanks for reading my review of Total Annihilation. I really hope you buy this game; it's truly a masterpiece."

I couldn't believe more people didn't know how intelligent its design was, how brilliant the waypointing and resource system were.  True, it is not a ""hard counter"" style of play like Starcraft; it is not a click-fest action-RTS hybrid where each unit has a special ability.  It is definitely hard-core RTS with many different build paths, a much deeper tech tree, and much larger armies that are still somehow easy to manage.  So many games and sequels (spiritual and direct) have tried to emulate the ease of play here, but they've all botched it up somehow.  True, it does somewhat boil down to a war of escalation, but it's damn fun every single time getting there.for $5 I'd recommend this to anyone unless you really can't stand RTS games in general."

Two factions, the ARM and the CORE, fight to ensure the complete destruction of the other in multiple story campaigns and battle tactics scenarios. In a skirmish match, your key unit is the Commander, which constructs units in real time using nanolathe technology. Destroy the enemy Commander to defeat the opposing army. This is one of the first RTS games to emphasize the importance of macromanagement in tandem with micromanagement.This game has great replayability. Although I have few hours logged on the Steam version, I have played through every campaign at least twice before buying it on Steam, once on medium difficulty and once on hard. During my medium playthrough, I had logged in a word document over fifty hours of my attempt at a speed run (which does not include failed attempts). Sometimes it is hard to believe that it was released 20 years ago because of its 3D sprites and map layouts, which were way ahead of its time. Total Annihilation is the inspiration for Supreme Commander, also developed by Chris Taylor, which also has a big following.Don't miss out on this gem."

The odds of the machine arriving with Total Annihilation on it's hard drive however seem incredible to me in hindsight. Of course initially, we, a 7-, 4- and 3-year-old didn't have much of a clue what we were doing playing this game, but I reckon by the time I was 10 or so I started getting better, reaching higher campaign missions. Never had the skill to complete the game back then though and I spent most of the time nuking the AI player on a random map with infinite metal, which was great fun in itself.Shortly before writing this review, I didn't know TA won Game of the Year in 1997, or even that it was made in 1997, but replaying this classic really made me realize why I was less impressed than my peers with later titles like Age of Empires 2 or Command & Conquer. TA had simply done so much better before them and I knew of it. I kid you not, Total Annihilation would be a strong title if it was released today. The mechanics of destruction feel so satisfying. Even the graphics don't look too bad. Most of today's titles cannot match it's diversity of units. TA had a pseudo-3D world where hills obstruct artillery fire, unit task queues and radar almost 20 years ago and I haven't even seen a similar veteran unit mechanic since. Even the story (I mean how cool is a Jupiter Brain?) is good and the soundtrack great. 7-year-old me in 1997 would have massively overestimated what a 2016 RTS title should look like based on this game, but I also get that if RTS-s would have progressed from TA to better as fast as things move in today's world, they would have become too complicated for most of the population by 1999 and everyone would have jumped ship for something simpler like Starcraft anyway.So yeah, it's highly debatable if any RTS has surpassed Cavedog's 1997 masterpiece, which works on a Pentium I, to this day."

He played it at work after hours with his coworkers, and I loved watching him play skirmishes at home. Eventually, he let me take a stab at it, and I quickly fell in love. Even though this game came out in 1997, it still brings a level of fun and strategy that isn't seen in many games that came after it. I still come back to it every once in a while, though not nearly as often as I used to, and relive the fun of crushing the filthy Core with endless waves of Flash tanks and Brawler planes. In recent times, my dad has stopped playing, and my younger brother never had as much fun with it as I did, but I still like to play a few matches here and there. I'm a purist when it comes to this game, and the most additional content I've installed has been the 3.1c patch and final 6 official Cavedog units. Sadly, this game takes a bit of work to get running smoothly on Windows 10, but it is WELL worth the effort.

No other game in my entire collection has more hours put into it than this game right here. Spanning across many, manyyears, multiple computer systems, multiple OS, and countless mods, no other game I've ever owned has had as much attention in my life as this game right here.And now, it's on Steam.It's not the best port, I'll say that right now. The cracked unofficial WIndows 7 version I had running on my Windows 8,1 computer two years ago ran smoother than this one, but I digress, to finally have this game on a Windows 10 computer is pretty nifty. It does look a bit dated compared to many modern RTS, but at the same time it has aged very well. If you've ever played a ""Collect resources, build things, destroy your enemy"" RTS in the past decade or so, Total Anihilation will be very easy to get into. There are a few technical issues with this port, and some fixes to resolution need to be made for certain, plust it seems the game only has the ""official"" patches, meaning the unit limit cap is sadly smaller than I'm used to.For those who thrived off of modding this game, you'll understand what I mean. For those that don't, let's just say a 500 unit cap was ""small"" to us.Technical aspects aside, it is still a decent port and truly a game worthy of giving a look over. A rare gem of an RTS that was revolutionary back in a time dominated by Starcraft and Command & Conquer. Here you not only get the original legendary game itself, but all it's expansions and the final patch that was released shortly before Cavedog studios went belly up. For the price you're paying, it's well worth a play.Either for nostalgia's sake, curiosity, or if you're like me and never want to stop playing this game, OS be damned, then seriously, get it.End the war spanning the galaxy, and leave your enemy in total annihilation."

I'm running windows 10 Pro, my CPU is a quad core i7 (4770K), and my GPU is a GTX 780 Ti. Not only have I never once had an issue running the game, but I often play with NVidia Surround turned on so it spans across all three of my monitors. That's probably as much ""chaos"" as I can put on the game's rendering engine and logic control, yet I've never had it not working flawlessly. It's not that it doesn't work on Windows 10. It just doesn't work on whatever configuration you have.That said:Total Annihilation was the first strategy game I've ever played back when it first came out. I still play it to this day and I even play multiplayer with my friend and my dad. TA was absolutely before it's time. Weapons and vision are affected by real Line of Sight and you can gain the advantage when attacking from higher ground.I don't want to go into a long winded review as that's not really my thing but this game maintains playability even after having already played it for 19 years so far (Released in '97). This really is a fun game absolutely worthy of buying! I've purchased it both on Steam and GOG despite the fact that I still have the original CDs. I definitely reccommend it."

When it was released in 1997, Total Annihilation was so far ahead of its time that in some respects it has never been duplicated since.At the time I write this review there is no Steamworks multiplayer or Workshop mod support. But if these things are implemented, I have no doubts whatsoever that we will see a huge resurgence of Total Annihilation. There are already tens of thousands of third-party units, many mega-mods of hundreds of units, total conversions for everything from Star Wars to WWII to Gundam, to entirely new games built on TA as a basis. The amount of strategic depth flowing from fairly simple rules of collecting metal from metal spots and using it to construct various types of units, using a continous economy, physics-based battles, and a serious need for planning and tactics rather than unit counter relationships, make Total Annihilation a much deeper and more interesting strategy game than most of its contemporary cousins, including Starcraft and Age of Empires.Real time strategy games have been starved for ideas for many years now, with the most successful ones being sequels and spiritual successors to genuinely innovative strategy games from the '90s. Alongside Starcraft, Total Annihilation is one of the great progenitors of the modern era of strategy games, and in many respects it has never been equaled."

This game set the standard upon what all RTS should be made. It had a number of features that were way a head of its time so the resolution is still great not to mention it was one of the first games to use advanced sound features so jeremy soule (Elder Scroll series, Harry Potter, Guild wars, a ton of other stuff) and his orchestrial soundtrack still get your adrenaline going.As others have said, this is a nostalgic game that still has a community that supports it +1000s of maps and mods along with that. If you buy this expecting it to look like a brand new RTS you will be mistaken.One last note.

BUYITRIGHTNOWGOI write this review holding my original copy of Total Annihilation in hand. But I'll just set it down, so I can type better. This game is what many other games have tried to emulate, but have failed in some aspect (looking mainly at YOU, Planetary Annihilation). It really should be able to please just about any RTS fan. Want a quick, in your face battle? You got it. Want a long war of attrition? Done (Play Seven Islands for an epic air/sea/nuke battle royale). The campaign is pretty solid too, from what I remember.The music is what I remembered the most, I think. It was just so epic, and fit the game so perfectly. And, for a game that's pushing 20 years old, it still has a charming look to it, not too far off from some indie games released much later. Sometimes pathing can be a bit annoying, but when your units get stuck, just blast them with your Commander's D-gun, for instant gratification.I think really the only negative thing I can say, is that this version includes all the expansion(s). I felt the base game is awesome without the new units and such. Also, I can't help but notice that the AI had to have been tweaked in some ways. It's much more predictable with the xpacs, and dumbed down. It is nice they included the map editor though, sometimes it feels that the provided maps can get stale. That might also be from playing every map many, many times.Cavedog was a pretty legit developer that just unfortunately got overwhelmed by a small market at that time period. I loved their other release, TA: Kingdoms as well. I've sunk tons and tons of hours into both TA series. And Boneyards (their inhouse online service) was so ahead of its time, as far as matchmaking, community, patch releases, and content updates on the reg, it's a shame nothing else has really come along, at least for me, that made the same impression.Pro Tip(s): You want more than 4 players/AI in a skirmish? After hitting the 'single' button, press * and the corresponding roman numeral to the amount of players you want. Example: *X would bump the limit to 10. Reap benefits and/or get rekt.You want to play any campaign mission, any way? From the main menu, click 'Single' then type, drdeath    All one word, no spaces, lowercase. A bone will appear in the gap on the right menu, that once clicked, a campaign master menu opens up, from which you can select any assortment of mission you'd like."

,Recommended,298030,19818716,"Posted: 20 December, 2015",all,BloodyFloody,"I'm a pretty crappy writer so I apologize in advance.Total Annihilation is an incredibly unique and intense RTS that was light-years ahead of its time and still is today. I still strongly prefer the original over the more spiritual-successor, Planetary Annihilation.Total Annihilation features so many small features that just make it amazing, the battles can be huge and intense with massive amounts of units having a huge Warhammer 40k esque fight all on one screen, or the games can be slow and brilliantly thought out. This is a strategy game where you can win purely by 'defensive' play at times, something I find to be rather unique among a lot of strategy games that even today have rather narrow methods to win, usually by just having the larger and better offensive force, but not always in Total Annihilation.A feature that makes Total Annihilation so unique is the true emphasis on a defensive playstyle, if you so desire. There are an impressive amount of options for defensive, slow play styles and faster, more offensive playstyles alike. You can choose to hunker down and improve your economy while building a large amount of turrets and upgrading to better ones over the course of the game, some are even capable of bombarding your opponent from the entire maps length, assuming you reach the demanding level of tech and economy required for them. Even tactical nukes can be constructed and launched over a map away if the game length and level of sustainable economy is reached. This allows for a lot of options for a lot of different types of players. There is also no real super demanding macro-memory required à la StarCraft II, making the game just a bit more accessable to newer players, especially in more team oriented game modes.The game also features incredible physics for it's more 2.5 dimensional, isometric strategy experience. One of my favourite things about this game is seeing things like unit inaccuracy, especially when on the move or on unstable ground or even when taking pot-shots at something through the fog-of-war. Units will have better vision when on the high ground and worse vision when in a trench, making a lot of areas on maps incredibly strategic locations. There's even bullet physics, units will often adjust their aim higher or lower depending on the target, and when the steel corpses begin to litter the battlefield they will often block incoming rounds harmlessly while your units continue to trudge past the enemy fire. There's a gritty feeling seeing all your units charge an enemy fortified position only to begin seeing the missiles and rounds begin to rain down upon them and seeing a huge chunk of your force get obliterated by a large round, shaking the screen and sending chunks of steel flying in every direction, the steel ""gibs"" even damaging nearby units who get hit by them.The game also features an amazing orchestral 'dynamic' music score written and composed by the one and only Jeremy Soule. The music really compliments an already fantastic game nicely, changing to a more brooding tone as you build up your base and switching to a more heart-pounding score as enemy fighters engage your army. It's an incredible soundtrack that you may even consider finding for your own music player. The sound design alone in this game is also very unique and give it a great distinct and 'mechanical' feel.If there was one strategy that I think is criminally unknown to most people, this would have to be it. It's made an amazingly tight-knit community that continue to play the original and have a huge modding scene. (Seriously, try the Total Annihilation Escalation mod, it's just insanely good.) Some even going as far as recreating the Total Annihilation experience in full 3D via an open source engine called Spring, try Spring Total Annihilation out sometime, it has a great community still supporting it to this day.Overall it's my favourite RTS game of all time, and I'm not even a huge RTS fan. It's incredibly exciting just to watch with an amazing soundtrack and huge, epic battles.10/10, would D-Gun again."

Being that the econ in this game is rather unique as compared to others, you don't exhaust resources just at you would in other games.That being said, resource production becomes a layer of immersion being that certain maps would produce more solar energy as opposing to wind energy and vice versa.The units themselves also bring a unique flair to the game by allowing a mulitude of different stratagies to arise from playing the game.This game was without a doubt one the best then and still is now.I could not be happier to see steam finally managed to get ahold of the game and has revived the game for the masses, if you can deal with the game looking dated you'll absoutely enjoy having countless hours of fun to an epic soundtrack. 12/10 You need this game period."

,Recommended,298030,19787106,"Posted: 19 December, 2015",all,Midnex,"One of the best games of my high school years. I have played this game so much, I don't think any other game can compare. The modding community at the time was crazy, tons of new options to add in. You can still find mods to this day. The first one was great but the expansions added so much more to the game. For its time this game was the Farcry of RTS, graphics were amazing, maps were never ending, and battles were not capped to 200 units per player. Game defaults to 1000 units, however patchs are available, or a simple edit of the config file to allow as many as you desire.When cavedog first offered their gaming service to connect players it was all I ever did. I finally had an endless amount of players to play with. It is just sad that the sequal to the game was such a downfall in the game play department. Seems to collopsed their mightly RTS empire.I hope you all enjoy this game as much as I did.Just some helpful hints to play the game, starting with before you actually playIt doesn't appear narration is available in the game, sad face. Maybe it is just mine. Secondly change left click to right click in the menus if your used to other RTS. Game sound starts at mono and can be changes to 3D (Stereo). Options accessed only once you select single or multiple player. Options in game can be selected by pressing tab. Game I believe is auto paused on start for all maps. Resolution support works for 1080p but must be selected, most games at this time barely supported 1280x1028.While playing:Speed can be adjusted during single and multiple player via the + or - buttons.Multiple buildings can be queued together using shift.Resource sharing is possible with allies at set increments so you never have to constantly send resources.Building units also has an infinite queue. Holding shift increments 5. Left click to add units, right click to remove.Your commander has a gun called the D-Gun hot key is D, this is a huge blast that can one shot everything but a commander and expieremental units not in the original (later expansions).If your commander dies in campaign it is the end of the match, multiplayer depending on settings. Your commander blows up like a big nuke.Planes build the slowest, then Kbots, then vechicles. Forgot hover vechicles, but they are in an expansion as well. Each one has different perks, and should be used together to cordinate strikes. However planes usually over power all else, as they are fast, hard to hit, and cheap to build."

By 1997 we could only really have one game on the PC to play, and Total Annihilation spent alot of time on there. Coming from C&C and AoE TA just blew them out of the water, two lovingly crafted factions, totally unique units and such a wide array of units it had too! You were never locked down into a play style, you had the tools to do whatever you felt necessary. Maps were varied, from closed corridor battles to open ground which often changed from pristine wildernesses to a decimated hell hole throughout the course of the map.The amount of content here is vast, it's an old school campaign, so tons of missions with good scaling difficulty, piles of maps for skirmishing and top mods available.

The scale of those battles was so much bigger than anything else at that time, I had a hard time playing any other RTS for years after TA.The classical music, played by 96-piece Northwest Sinfonia orchestra, was also perfectly fitting for that kind of game, really good quality by Jeremy Soule, composer of Icewind Dale, Baldur's gate, Oblivion, Skyrim music and many more. Music switched depending on what you were doing, which was also uncommon at that time (with ""battle themes"" and ""quiet themes"" for construction phases, something we didn't see in every game at that time).Unit animation was also awesome for that time, with all those small robots animated everywhere. Seeing a group of robots run in one direction but with their torsos turned in another to shoot at an enemy is fun to see.The game universe is great, very varied, lots of different map styles and landscapes. Game depth can be quite deep. There is A LOT of units (hundreds in base game, and hundreds in each DLC), and quite a lot of them are useful. Also has an incredible mix of units, from ""pure"" land tanks, or bombers, to planes that can ""land"" underwater, amphibious tanks, hovercraft units. Same for resources, a lot of different ways to get any of each of them, for power for example, you can go solar, nuclear, hydro plants, wind plants, etc.Also, low price, all extensions (DLC) included, much better than all those 20 years old base games with terrible port sold for over $10."

This is one of those few games that is still playable today, it has a big variety of units from land, sea, and air to choose from and can change the outcome of the game.  The units are 3D modeled on a 2D interface, and there are units that the TA community have built that can be inserted into the game to increase the types of units and structures that you can build.  A person/persons put together a mod that can be used with TA that makes changes to the games interface and includes new units and defense structures to make the game more interesting.   There are those people that will complain about the graphics, but the graphics are still fine, you can tell what the units are supposed to be and there is still detail on the units themselves, it's not like they are just flat Atari tanks and planes moving around.  I own many RTS games, this is still one of the best ones out there that has good balance and a slew of things to make, not to mention the patrol system is still ahead of many modern games.  One of the cool things of today is that this game can be played using huge maps and 1000+ units/buildings and still run great due to todays processors.  If you enjoy huge battles that will force you to make various things to win, then this is a game for you, but if you like your star craft and like to build few things and rely on specific units, then you best stick to your star craft type games."

All aspects of the game are easy to understand and intuitive. From a clean UI, to satisfying movement and speed of vehicles, the game just feels right. Once you've completed the campaign, skirmishes will entertain for a long time.GraphicsThe visuals still hold up, with solidly modeled machines, angling to accommodate the contours of the landscape - an original feature at release, it still looks convincing to this day. A very complete selection of environment types to choose from, offering varied experiences.SoundThe music of the game is excellent.

I remember walking through Sam's Club back in 1997 and seeing the display for this game. A buddy of mine bought the game and told me you gotta see this game. Never before had we seen anything like it and we were instantly hooked as were several other of our friends. Back the, you had to download a program so you play against others, so we opted for Lan parties instead.Since 1997, I have pulled this game out and played it everyyear since. When I tried to load it up a week ago, it didn't work. Was a little dissappointed and thought it was time to move on and then it popped up on my front page yesterday. I didn't hesitate.The base game and both expansions are here and there are at least 150 single player missions and more units than you can possibly imagine. Makes for very large scale battles, especially if you are playing on one of the metal maps. The graphics are obviousley lacking and the game isn't as revelutionary as it was then, but this game has great meaning for me and changed the way I viewed gaming. It was the first game that got me really excited and it changed the way games were made.I remember Chris Taylor saying he wanted to go straight to TA2, but they wanted to make TA:Kingdoms, which was a game I enjoyed, but not even close to as much as TA. And because they didn't go straight to TA2, well, the rest is history. TA:K didn't do so well and the company eventually went under with no sequel ever done. The ownership has changed many times over (last I heard a company in Japan had it and wouldn't part with it) and a sequel does not seem to ever be coming which is a tragedy. It is probably one of the reasons this game is as iconic and beloved as it still is today.After loading up the game last night, I coudn't beleive that 2 hours had passed so quickly. Still love and cherish this game.Still loving this game and just played it for the 20th year in a row."

So i bought the game... again?Man, i can't tell you how many thousands of hours i threw into this game while growing up, And the thousands more i have with the mods i downloaded.Im running on a win10, i booted up the game and it worked flawlessly. had to google some things i forgot like adding -d for windows as a launch parameter, and setting the game's resolution in the main menu before starting the game. But after i got past the small things i jumped right into the game and started playing, killing some bots quickly and then moving on to some mods.2 mods to look at are zero, and escalation.But without mods the game is considered a mass RTS. You start out with just your commander and you gather some metal deposits in the world, generate energy, and create some buildings for defenses, and factorys to produce your units.In a game like this, you want to be using up 100% of your produced resourses 24/7, pumping out as many units as you possibly can. If you go over, you run your storage dry and production gets slower. If you dont use 100% you end up wasting excess when your storage is full.Default maps are very bland for me, i usually just to randomly pick one and go with it.And if you play against the AI, even on the hardest difficulty you are going to destroy them easily in a 1v1, once you know the base of the game."

I recall being immediately blown away by how fluid and realistic the action was.  I remember the presenter showed an ingame clip of the action depicting a dozen of infantry bots marching haphazardly through a plain with some trees scattered about.  Meanwhile ovehead, three fighters intercepts an incoming enemy bomber.  The fighters fired a salvo of missiles, and barrel rolls away from the explosion of a downed bomber.  EPIC.I brought this game more than 20 years ago.  I've recreated that scene on numerous occasions and then some.  I felt the combination of variety in unit behavior, weapon physic, and the rock/paper/scissor approach to balancing was the epitomy of what real time strategy games are.  Twenty years later, I believe this is still the core defintion that only one other RTS IP was able to achieve, and that's Homeworld.There's Supreme Commander and Planetary Annihiliation, but those are essentially spiritual successors.

This makes some levels difficult, but not for tactical reasons. This is frustrating. Enemies should not have infinite line of sight, that's unreasonable.Total annihilation is hard for all the wrong reasons, also units are difficult to control, they do their own thing a lot.Steam please sell Dark Reign, it's the best RTS game OF ALL TIME and does not have all the weakesses of Starcraft or TA."

,Recommended,298030,29098053,Posted: 7 January,all,Zefar,An old time classic that still holds up pretty well. With the exception of UI flaws this game is actually able to stand the test of time. Which is quite rare for a RTS game. It'll run on Windows 10 too but some things need to be installed first.So what can you expect? It's an RTS with infinitive resources that needs to be balanced. Metal and Energy. While you have a stock amount of metal and Energy this will quickly go away if you can't keep up with the demand and when it hits bottom things will take far longer to build.The two sides have similar units on Tier 1 but on Tier 2 they vary a bit. But most units can be useful later on. Arm are the best looking though. Just a fact.With mods installed you can build up to 1000 per player but that generally just crashes the game so keep to 500 per player. The AI can't really handle this amount either as they'll do stupid things like building 100 Metal extractors instead of Moho Mines on a metal planet.You'll also get conga lines of enemies towards your base and these lines can be pretty long and pretty big. For instance with 1000 units on that line is just one long line from the enemy base to my base. Or rather to the range of my turrets.There are plenty of unit mods for this game and you'll be needing some programs in order to use them all. But there is still a limit on how many you can have.If you decide to play online you can limit how many units the AI can build of certain things and this can be used to stop them from building a ton of useless structures. Could be a way to make it more of a challenge too.

I tried a multiplayer session with a friend and we could not join each other's game, regardless of who hosted. I was hoping the game code would have been revamped to work on modern operating systems, but that seems to not be the case. It's dependent on DirectPlay, an API that has been deprecated by Microsoft since the early 2000's.edit:At the time we attempted to play this game, my friend and I were on the same local area network (192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.11). At one point, I did alt+tab out of the game, and added an exception, when prompted, to the Windows Firewall to allow this game to communicate. We were able to see each other's game on the list of games, but when either of us attempted to join the other's hosted game, the interface would lock up and hang indefinitely.My review of not recommending this game is solely based on the game's current state. The networking code is obviously dated and doesn't ""work out of the box,"" requiring tweaking and/or third-party extensions to make it work. This is not what I had in mind when I paid $5 for the Steam version of this game.As far as the game itself, my friend and I had a lot of fun playing this game a decade ago when it worked.

Since WHEN does a building count as a unit? In pretty much every RTS ever made, a unit is MOBILE, a character or vehicle with combat, constructive, or special abilities. Buildings are STATIONARY. They typically do nothing to defend your base and are used for production purposes. So, let's say you're expanding your base, fighting tooth and claw for metal, building solar complexes and also building DEFENSES to PROTECT what you've had to fight hard for. Laser towers on resource spots, production buildings abroad so you can deploy forces from key locations. Well guess what? This whole time you've been expanding your base, you have been taking space from your COMBAT UNITS.There is a UNIT CAP. So now, if you do have an expanded base, there's a good chance the enemy has a larger fighting force than you and regardless of whether you attack or wait to be attacked, you'll take heavy casualties and the enemy will sense this and just overwhelm you with a larger army. Oh and the game DOESN'T tell you how close you're getting to the unit cap. So you basically have to finely tune the production of everything or else you might waste an hour and a half because your fighting units are crippled by the unit cap. This is the issue I've found in campaign and it's kind of horse s***.In closing, why does a game called TOTAL ANNIHILATION, which is about the mass production of combat robots between two factions who have been hating each other for 400 years have this cap? It's like putting a diaper on a grizzly bear. Wherever we look, sentient robots are a HUGE problem. Terminator: the whole damn planet has been overrun with machines. Mass Effect: THE WHOLE F****** UNIVERSE is about to be destroyed by machines. Robots bring two things when they attack, firepower and numbers. In a game like Age of Empires it makes sense. Want to train more troops and villagers? You need more houses/castles for your people to shelter in. Robots don't give a f*** about rest and typically don't care about how much space is left on the planet, they just want to kill stuff!"

War materials are broken into two catagories of either metal or energy, both of which are harvested at a constant rate through each resource generation structure.All in all, TA is my favorite strategy game of all time and I've played countless hundreds of hours blowing up my enemies and securing map domination."

T.A. also was the first to correctly utilize a queing system, you can have an endless number of buildings qued up to be built at once. There is keyboard short cuts for selecting all of one type of unite or selecting all units, there is a self destruct button to remove blunders while building. you can even have thousands of units qued up to be built instead of just 5 per building like starcraft.

,Recommended,298030,19921123,"Posted: 24 December, 2015",all,Potato Girl,"Total Annihilation is a ridiculously fun and addictive RTS game that was developed in 1997 by a little company called Cavedog. For an almost 20-year-old game, it's amazing how fun this game is to still play.The user interface is very user-friendly, and the game itself is simple to learn. Despite the ease of being able to get into the game and just start playing, there is a wide variety of units that allow an incredible level of complex creativity in terms of strategy. Total Annihilation is like eating candy without the calories: it gives you a cool robot army, huge explosions, and probably one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard composed for a game.Total Annihilation is also very mod-friendly and customizable.Despite being a great game, there are some pitfalls: Getting a multiplayer game can be tricky if you have no idea what you're doing. You will need to connect to the ip address of the host, which most modern games do for you automatically. Additionally, there is a unit cap of 250 (which includes buildings) that you *can* increase, but you have to manually edit the totala.ini file. This can be a pain in the butt for the computer-challenged, but isn't difficult to actually do.The main complaint I hear about this game is the pathfinding. And I agree. Sometimes your units will do what seem to be nonsensical things, like trying to drive up a wall instead of going around it. Very large armies also have difficulty moving around, and the units tend to get stuck on each other. Naval units are the best example of this, where they will grind against each other trying to find their way to a destination. There ARE pathfinding patches out there that will significantly help with these difficulties, though.Overall, this is a great game. I highly recommend it for pretty much anyone ever."

Beyond all the great things about the original game there is, even to this day, a great gaming community with an almost unlimited amount of maps, units and mods. All in all I give this game 11/10 and recommend this to anyone"

If you're looking to experience what is arguably the dawn of modern real time strategy gaming, give this title a spin...

Nice and simple, multiple gathering options for each.- Great base defence options, great variety of turrets.- Huge variety of maps, covering multiple terrain types.- Lengthy campaigns, with a great variety of levels.- Soundtrack is epic, with vibrant orchestral pieces- Game comes with all expansions and DLC bundledCons:- AI isn't great. Not idiotic, but does occasionally build navies in small lakes- Battles are often slow-burn affairs as a lot of maps allow for turtling and take time to seize ground, not great for short games.- AI pathing is capable of spectacular failures, getting units stuck.- Scenery (specifically trees) make base building awkward on some maps as getting construction units to remove them is time-consuming and they are often hard to click on.One of the best strategy games ever made. Playing it for the first time in about seven years felt weird, especially because I felt it would have aged worse than it has. Graphics are nothing pretty and visually it has aged badly, but gameplay puts many newer games to shame. Worth the price of admission!"

I loved this game then and I love it now!The main question for people who played this in the past is likely what i asked. Does it run well? Answer, Yes. Does it do multiplayer? Answer, I've been told it does but alas life is a hinderance to LAN parties these days.Also, all the DLC is included. Including the annoying bugs that needed to be fixed for a modern gamer.So, the game is still awesome, but skimish AI is a bit basic. The campaign AI can be a bit errrr.... cruel. Some times the AI wil throw everything they have at you on the first scheduled attack. Don't get me wrong, it makes me laugh but can be annoying. lol. Also, game does not autosave so remember to save after missions.Lastly, one thing that I forgot until i started playing this again... units will not fire on targets within range but have not be sighted. i.e on radar. Its a odd annoyance but its there to stop capture targets being destoryed by AI. So if it happens, likely it was your fault :)Anyway for the price, freaking bargain.

It's simple and elegant in its implementation.  My only complaint is issues with unit pathfinding, especially once the battlefield is strewn with the wreckage of all the attacking forces that met their explosive end under the thundering cannons of my defense grid.It's a great game, and it well stands the test of time."

I'm still damn impressed that this game from '97 supported widescreen (16:9) aspect ratios straight out of the box (Quite literally so, I remember first buying this game when it came in a cardboard box).Things that I remember impressed me about Total Annihilation back in 1999:-• 3D units• You could start forest fires• The ability to mine rocks for metal and harvest trees for surplus energy• The messy aftermath of significant battles (big battles left a big mess, metal wreckage of hundreds of destroyed units would litter large portions of the map)• You could often recycle the metal from the wreckage of destroyed unitsThe explosions in-game are also awesome, and will gratify most action junkies. When your units get destroyed, the explosions are screen-shaking, audibly thunderous, polygonal chunks of shrapnel debris hurtle through the air all over the place.When your commander unit is destroyed, it triggers an enormous nuclear explosion that causes significant 'splash damage', therefore when you sense an inevitable defeat you have an opportunity to rage quit in a kamikaze-esque enemy-destroying nuclear blaze of glory.If you like RTS games, science fiction and playing with nuclear weapons, you should check this game out."

So you are probably thinking: ""Why did you buy it AGAIN?""The answer:It's just that f@$%ing good.I have spent countless hours playing this game, my hours of playing on Steam are only an extremely small fraction of how much I have played this.This game, Halo:CE, Halo 2, Star Wars Battlefront I & II, EAW, and Republic Commando made up a pretty large chunk of my childhood. Total Annihilation is just as good as I remember it. Fun, simple, full of hours upon hours of enjoyment. Of course, being this old, the graphics won't blow you away, and there are bound to be glitches and bugs. It is still extremely fun, and has good LAN support, so if you set everything up correctly and use Hamachi or Tunngle, it would be a very enjoyable experience for you and your friends. There are also many custom maps and units available on sites like TA Universe. Need a giant nuke robot? No problem. Need X-Wings? Of course! Nuke planes? Yep, they have that too. They even have full blown fan-made expansion packs and updates that add numerous new features. All you need to install them is basic computer knowledge.If you want an RTS that isn't overly complicated, extremely fun, has high moddability, can run on really any PC you throw at it? This is your best bet.Would I reccomend this?HELL YEAH."

Because of this nothing seems forced and the game just works. this is a great game and i wish that more games today were like this."

With the latest patch from TA Universe installed, the information below is irrelevant. Make sure you get the latest patch, and NOT one of the archived cracked totalA.exe files for various max unit caps. These don't work with the Steam version of the game.As downloaded from Steam, the game defaults to 250 units and there is no TotalA.ini file, so you'd have to make (or DL) one before you could change to the OTA supported max unit cap of 500 units. However, if this was all you did, then more often than not, the game will crash when both sides are at max units and the fur is starting to fly, and this will happen regardless of whether you have max cap setting of 250 or 500.As soon as I replaced the default version of TotalA.exe with the version of TotalA.exe included in the 1500 unit patch from TA Universe, the game consistently crashed at random times. This happened several times, even though I was within 500 total units at the time. I tried disabling Direct Sound and used Windows sound instead, but the result was exactly the same. Sound isn't the issue.My system is Windows 7 x64bit with a relatively old Nvidia GeForce GTX 750Ti graphics card. I have the latest patch from TA Universe installed and three mods installed. No problems. If you loved TA back in the day, and want it back again, you absolutely can. I also highly recommend using TA Universe as your map and mod source for the game. They've come a long way since the old days, and their site is extensive."
