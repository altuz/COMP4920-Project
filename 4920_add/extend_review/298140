76561198075522608,Recommended,298140,10177759,"Posted: 20 May, 2014",all,Yanfaye,"Whilst I haven't played many games of the Point and Click genre, I do know that the game Scratches has a much bigger map than this one. The voice acting is good, and the graphics aren't too bad but certainly not top notch either. You may find the fonts used throughout the game (even on the main menu) offputting as they don't blend well with the game or interface in my opinion.I bought it at a discounted price, but to be honest I am having trouble deciding whether or not it was worth that. The storyline was good but, leaves a lot to be answered as we never do meet the girl who is the 'damsen in distress' throughout the entire game. That being said though, it has an interesting theme and I did enjoy the puzzles for the most part.As for the horror factor, there were a couple of parts that made me jump but it's not really a scary game. The music throughout was sub-par, but bear in mind this may have been made on a small budget.In conclusion, if you like point and click games Rhiannon: Curse of the Four Branches has some tricky puzzles, and will be worth picking up at a discounted price. If you are looking for horror, this is very mild at best. And if bad fonts bother you, I wouldn't go for it. Still, I'd recommend it as I managed to finish the game and the story is fairly thorough."

I don't play point and click games very often because is seems like we've moved on since that era, however, Rhiannon is an exception.  If you like puzzle games, you'll may want to give this game a shot.Pros:Unique and challenging puzzlesEngaging story lineDecent graphics for the dayMost of the puzzles are good logic puzzlesClues are scattered about forcing you to find and put them togetherDifferent areas become available as you progress through the gameThe map lets you jump from one place to another saving timeCons:Two or three of the puzzles don't make a lot of senseToo much reading (there is a lot of filler in the journals, information you don't need)Using the maps jump feature may cause you to miss important informationAt the time of this review, this game was selling for $5.99.  Well worth it in my opinion."

76561198103058427,Recommended,298140,28313534,"Posted: 11 December, 2016",all,grandelezier,"I can simply recommend this game for adventure game players. And probably only for such genre admirers, as game has obvious budget and technical limitations.Nonentheless, game developers tried to compensate that with the plot, atmosphere and puzzles. And I am convinced that they managed to do that pretty well.14 hours of playing in my case - quite a lot for such, rather anonymous, title.Thumb up."
76561197993862065,Recommended,298140,27713274,"Posted: 26 November, 2016",all,IceHippo,"Recommend but at discount only, about 5-8 hours of gameplay, great storytelling, annoying puzzlesThere are lots of items to interact with in the game world, and the game will only allow you to put into your inventory items that you can use immediately. I recommend every time you find something that you make a note of what it is and where it is located, since it's very likely you'll need it for some future puzzle. Sometimes what the game considers ""usable right away"" might be different than your logic. The map feature allows you to jump between key locations, but sometimes it seems like you need to move to a certian area to trigger an event in the game. So if you are stuck somewhere trying to pick up an object that it looks like you need right now, try walking (not jumping) to a different location.It seems like the more non-intuitive puzzles are right at the beginning, which is too bad. This is the sort of game that I can see people getting stuck on and giving up on early. The storytelling is excellent, and even if the interface is showing its age it still is a good game.Good:+ Good story-driven point and click game that is tied into Welsh legends with great ambient music.+ Decent length, if you can get over the negatives it can be a very good value for the priceNeutral:. Graphics are from the FHD era (I first played this in 2008) but this doesn't affect too much. Contains some music puzzles. Has a mapping feature for external locations. Has a notebook to prompt you what puzzles to solve to progress the storyNegative:- Some puzzles are maddeningly non-intuitive (it helps to have the Gameboomers walkthrough bookmarked)- Some locations have the ""invisible wall"" effect, or ""why can't I move right *there*?""Even for the cheap price, I can only recommend this on discount unless you are a strong fan of Welsh lore or other games of the ""U.K. horror"" genre (i.e. Lost Crown, Darkfall, Barrow Hill). I got it 80% off ($1 and change) which was plenty good for this game."

76561198082975636,Recommended,298140,11885489,"Posted: 27 August, 2014",all,morgwenn,"One of the most beautiful point&click I've ever played. I liked it very very much. There are games in which you waste your time wandering wandering around whitout understanding what to do and tring every item on everything, hoping it would trigger something.. in Rhiannon you can procede step by step and only what is really necessary in that moment (the right item is highlighted on the right space). And don't forget the story is awesome, interesting and haunting, Definitevely, you must have it in your library!"
76561198060061717,Recommended,298140,20279933,"Posted: 3 January, 2016",all,gavoid,"A good little game. I bought this after becoming addicted to games like Barrow Hill and the Lost Crown and found this whilst seaching for similar. It's not so creepy as the aforementioned, more of a ""new-agey"" kind of tale, inspired by Welsh mythology. Actually pretty educational as that's not something I knew much of and there is a fair bit of reading involved here. The puzzles? Well I must confess to using a walkthrough a fair bit, they are tricky but mostly well thought out - you might want to take notes along the way!It did actually seem a bit of a drag at first as you can only pick up objects as and when they are required so I found myself backtracking alot. This was until I read that the map serves as a quick travel system so once I twigged that the game became far more enjoyable.All in all a good little yarn for fans of supernatural point and clicks, It'd be nice to see more from this studio."
,Recommended,298140,23409008,"Posted: 5 June, 2016",all,Rhiannon,"I owned this game before on CD [played it years ago] and i recently got it on here with a free CD key, so i played it through and with a speed run [recalling stuff from memory] and completed it in 2 hours which im pretty happy about.It even added a few extras in this version than the CDThe only problem i had with it was the bar at the bottom of the screen which isnt on my CD version and the fact i cant do a 1 click turn round like i could in the CD ~ but i think its an excellent game thototally recomended for anyone ~ caution though there is some jumpy bits if your not expecting them"
76561198348130735,Recommended,298140,31286991,Posted: 21 April,all,sophiekicks22,"this game has a good atmosphere tinged with unease and spookiness, as well as story that pulls from the rich Welsh mythology and the puzzels are a nice challenge, (though if you skim over the clues or instructions or forget to pay attention to the order of certain steps like i did once or twice in the beginning, you will be making more work for yourself). and honestly i grew to appreciate the system of not being able to pick up certain objects until you needed them, it actually helped me remember what was what betterbut it does need to be said that the in game movement is an issue. navigating inside the house was a chore at best, and it is incredibly easy to miss clues and objects because getting into the right position to see them can be very frustrating.still, overall i liked the game, but it is not without some issues."
76561198052140352,Recommended,298140,12176798,"Posted: 21 September, 2014",all,emcdotomb,"This game is very tedious. Be prepared to get eye strain reading all of the pages of hard to read dairies and other documents. That said, for a game that is fairly old it is well done and for the price is worth the challenge. Like most games of this type trying to figure out what to do next is the real problem. The game has many places to visit and many ""screens"" to study. It's easy to overlook important clues. Acess to a good walk through will lessen the frustration factor. The lead chracter is absolutely fearless  in that she goes places and does things that the average person would not do in light of all of the stange events that she is experiencing.  I didn't find any bugs or have any crashes while playing this game."

I love the setting and the sound, and once you get over a few quirks in the inventory interface, the puzzles mostly make sense.This game makes me wish I was Welsh."

It was quite spooky with the whispering voices saying 'Rhiannon' over and over again, but that only made me feel more immersed in the game. I did have trouble with playing the game though, it's not easy to work out what to do and you sometimes have to stretch your imagination a bit far to work out some of the puzzles and some of the objects were a bit too well hidden. I recomend this game for people who like challenge in their puzzle games."

,Recommended,298140,16639491,"Posted: 22 June, 2015",all,gNatalie,"Uh wow. To start I am fully admitting to using a walkthrough for most of the game because I was not smart and didn't realise there was a fast travel (of sorts) so I was getting tired of walking everywhere.That aside this game delivers history with the twist of a curse passed down to modern day. I really did like learning about the tales of old (though it IS a lot of reading and information to remember). And even though I used a walkthrough it didn't feel like I lost any of the emotion and atmosphere of the game. Espcially not when you get poorly timed phone calls during the ""scary"" section of the game.6/10Save Rhiannon with books and branches!"
,Recommended,298140,33703654,Posted: 21 July,all,khyren,"I really enjoyed the game.  It was like the old days of writing things down and solving puzzles.  The only con was that you cannot pick something up until it is needed, even if you can foresee how it will be needed.  So you have to remember where it was.  That was the only thing I really had to ""cheat"" on.  I looked up where things were so I wouldn't have to look in every area again.The story was interesting, and I didn't mind at all reading the letters, diaries, clippings, emails etc.  In fact, you HAVE to read them or you will miss something vital!Anyway, fun game. :)"
