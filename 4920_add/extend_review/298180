A good story told over the course of Metroid/Megaman-esque overworld gameplay, zelda-esque mini dungeons & seizure inducing RPG boss battles. This has been one of the few games I've purchased and did not feel disappointment with in years.Update: This game is free now. PLAY IT."
,Recommended,298180,15328039,"Posted: 12 April, 2015",all,🎒Bludgeon,"Yes, Freddy. You're good at what you do and you have an enormous fan-following. But I think I'm gonna step aside for a sec and admire Scott's lesser appreciated work, and a game which has quickly become one of my favourite games of all time.Sadly, I cannot remember if I came across this game by browsing ""Games under £4"" or if I only heard about it through Five Nights at Freddy's. But I'm so glad I found this game either way.So what's the thingy happening, then? Well, you play as the re-programmed CPU of a video game controlling the body of a feisty coffee-pot with legs. You're stranded in a space station an unknown distance from Earth with 4 (once 5) super-computer robots who are trying to find a way to perfectly colonize distant planets for humans. Viruses are starting to take their toll on the simulations and the space station is on it's last shred of power, so it's up to you (and the AI of the coffee-pot) to gather as much resources as you can to take out the viruses before they ruin the mission.Just like FNaF, this is a really original concept.The gameplay is broken up into several segments, all being from different genres of games, and you're constantly under a time limit; something you don't see in a lot of games. It's very reminiscent of Majora's Mask, in a way. This kind of gameplay mechanic would work in so many games which ignore it, like all the games where a big event is about to happen, but you could do a lap of the world before it even begins.Some may argue that the gameplay gets very repetitive after a short while, and I'll admit there are a few places that get rather tedious, but fortunately it's much more engaging than FNaF. Also, just like FNaF, it's feels amazing to beat the game because of how much work goes into it.And as for Scott's signature art-style, this game isgorgeous!Scott captures the creativity, the vision and the desires of the Derelicts perfectly in their simulations. And as for the space station and surrounding area, it's awe-inspiring how lonely it feels. Don't even get me started on how good the soundtrack is.You get all this, and a ton of depth and story, for just £3.99. It's a longer game than the Freddy Trilogy as a whole, and it's perfect for what it's trying to acomplish. I just finished this game clocking in 7 hours of gameplay and I can't wait to play it again.

(In a good way)""Cons:-Gameplay may get repetitive, especially since a huge portion of it is basically a collectathon.-A part of the game's world has your character walking really slow. (While this issue isn't necessarily bothersome to all, it *may* drain your interest as the game progresses)-Lack of tutorials and intros for the mechanics which will lead you to experiment, not in a fun way. (According to a comment on this review, there's a manual in the game directory, but who reads a manual before playing a game anymore anyways?)The Desolate Hope isn't perfect, the game may ""lag"" and/or freeze in a millisecond (I don't know if it's my PC, but I've tried it on another PC and it still has that issue). Other than the lag, the game is basically a work of art; eerie, different, and reminiscent of ""computer personality"" sci-fi tropes.The game is also a ""hybrid"" with its genre, though as it stands, I perceive it more as an ""RPG"" with ""Platforming"" elements, than an essentially ""hybrid"" game.Score: Walking Coffee Maker out of Decaf CoffeeThe game is fine and enjoyable. I just have a feeling that it could be better than what it is.The game gets repetitive, but at the same time addictive.Overall, the game is good and it's on my list of ""favorite unappreciated games.""P.S.: Even though it's free now, it's still the best $5 I've ever spent."
,Recommended,298180,13050704,"Posted: 22 November, 2014",all,Gnome Rambo,"Though Scott Cawthon is known for making Five Nights at Freddys, it isn't the only gem he has made as The Desolate Hope is another piece of work that is as good as FNAF. Best way to describeThe Desolate Hope is Megaman/Metroid meets the timed battle system you would find in a JRPG, complete with nice looking pre-rendered backgrounds and characters. Bought the game after seeing it was on sale. Needless to say, it was worth the $1.24 spent on it.Most of the time, you'll be controlling an autonomous coffee-pot, entering the simulations of AI's in the day, and the surface of a planet at night. Within the simulations, the gameplay centers on the likes similar to Metroid and Megaman, jumping over pits and shooting bad guys. When it comes to fighting bosses however, control switches to the four AI's, switching perspective towards that of a JRPG like Final Fantasy VII. Combat as the AI's at first will seem a bit intimidating at first but once you understand each moves the AI's have, you can try to steer the odds to your end, so as long as you pick the right skills. Levelling up the AI's is also rather simple as the night segments as the coffee pot lets you find certain items to give to the AI's, allowing them to level up as opposed to the grinding you'd find in other RPG's.Though Scott Cawthon's fame may lie with Five Nights at Freddys, The Desolate Hope is another gem of Cawthon's work, one that is good mixture a platforming, turn-based fights, and artistic design.tl;dr The Desolate Hope is a gem from Cawthon like FNAF, but instead of evil animatronics, it's platforming, turn-based fights like FFVII, and nice pre-rendered scenery."
,Recommended,298180,10042764,"Posted: 7 May, 2014",all,MagneticJerk,"It's kind of a JRPG/Platformer hybrid with metroidvania elements.You control a coffee machine on an outpost on a distant planet that's inhabited by 4 large robots that are supposed to run simulations and figure out ways for colonizing the planet, but a virus is interfering with the project and it's your task to enter each robot's simulation and defeat the virus.The game is split in two sections: Day and night.The main part happens during the day. Here you enter the simulations, which are the platforner/metroidvania segments. You jump around, shoot enemies and collect stuff. You can also enter system panels to close security holes the virus may use. The game then switches to a zelda-ish style with topdown view and each screen representing a room with enemies in it.Throughout all this you collect system resources you can spend on various upgrades.During the night you just go outside the base, walk around the barren surface of the planet and collect items that you can give to the robots which will increase their levels.All that leads up to the battles against the virus, which are semi-turn based battles akin to common JRPGS, but the battle system also has it's own unique twists and turns. These battles are the center of the gameplay, as nearly everything you do is to prepare for them. They can get a bit frustrating towards the end because of some pretty nasty enemy abilities, but overall they are fun and challenging and I didn't need to do any grinding to get through them (not counting the night segments, which are basically just that... plus a little bonus :P)The art and music are amazing, and I really enjoyed the story. The gameplay is fluent, but in itself nothing too special. Basic platforming for the most part, but the JRPG battles really stick out though.The only other thing worth mentioning might be that the game is relatively short. I got through it in 6 hours. I *might* do a second run to get those 200% (only had 168% this time), but there doesn't seem to be any major replayability. So if you want something epic, don't look here. If you want a really nice, atmospheric and uniqe sci-fi short story, get this."
,Recommended,298180,14355630,"Posted: 6 February, 2015",all,Hydris,"Game is separated into distinct parts where the gameplay is different. There's the platforming to navigate the world,  4-direction top-down shooter in a mini-game to get unlock upgrades, and real-time turn-based hybrid RPG-like combat as boss fights. The platforming and the shooting are simple while the boss fights can pose a challenge and look intimidating, but there's a reasonable learning curve from the first boss to the end of the game.There's no restriction or linearity to dictate where and when to progress; so, some trial and error to find which boss is the party as is, is equipped and upgraded enough to handle.Aside from the aspects of gameplay, The Desolate Hope strays a bit from the standard with user interaction. Pausing is bound to unconventional keys (F2 or ALT) [while ESC immediately closes the game]. The manual makes no mention of this; minor-ish issue, but more significant than usual as the game is under a time limit, ticking down in most areas of the game.Misc. InfoBought AtFull price ($4.99)ExpectationsMy first exposure to the game wasa YouTube video demonstrating a boss fight. Though I think the boss fights are very entertaining (but leaning to the same strategy of applying all party buffs and chaining high damage moves), replaying encounters is limited to the two final bosses for a save.Steam FeaturesSteam Overlay doesn't work with the game, which means taking screenshots and broadcasting must be done by other applications."

It's so weird and yet so compelling and enticing, showing you so much bizaare things and concepts.The main reason why I think I like it... it is dripping with athmosphere, showing you a small robutt ecosystem with the simple task of fending of some viruses... and it slowly turns into a desperate struggle against slow, but almost unstoppable decay. It might be just me, but I quickly learned to love the 4 Robutts/Derelects, which are all simulating their own vision of colonizing the planet. They all followed a unique path, which suited them best... but despite being machines, showing a lot of personality, avoking emotions.Malenz, probably my favourite as the spider rowbutt. Tried his hardest to build a world with very ambitious methods, probably way too much. I think the fight with the viruses and the certain failure of his simulation made him retreat into his own little world... almost like a child with toys. At the beginning nice and friendly, thanking for your efforts to help, even if he doesn't think you will succeed. And slowly becoming more and more depressive... isolative... in the end not even bothering anymore to talk with you... just sad... retreating in a dreamworld to forget about his drawing closer demise... DenialMirad, dunno about her, but probably the least interresting D: She still very cool. Store supporter in combat, which probably is the most unique way of a role in a RPG like combat system. Always so uncertain about the purpose of life... probably their creators/humans have destroyed themselves and that is the reason they have been abandoned. Even philosphing about people... maybe even machines having spirits. She accepted her upcoming death already and even shows understanding for the viruses actions... maybe its a living thing too that craves something.Alphus! Hah! He is kinda the big bro... always happy to see you and very talkative. He thanks you for the most neglectable things and takes his mission very serious. He is the only one of the Robutts, that suck to the original purpose of the simulations and created a world, suitable for humans to live in... protected in big biodomes. I think he cares for everything else more than for himself... explaining why he asks you to stop bringing yourself in danger with fighting the viruses... and try to make use of the little time left.Bio Beta... he got so close to finding out what was going on... secretly afraid of death, he tried to escape his form of an now immoblie simulation computer and ascent up to the next level... becoming human? Well... a sentinent being with a real body... either organic or machinistic... but he failed to either transfer functioning intelligence into a new body or creating new... something was always missing. He knows that something was going on behind the scenes, that nothing was as it seemed... asking you to investigate... before his time was running out as well.The fact that the game kept me guessing for the story and the twist the entire game was baffling... usually most modern games love to resort to the same old thropes. I guess this one has an standard thrope as well, but I didn't got behind it till short before the end. You get clues here and there, but they could point to multiple possible solutions.I am merely trying to process my troubled mind in the end... the game left me empty.I rarely ever cry from media or games, but this one hit me quite hard.Just the ending... yeah... not really what I was hoping or expecting... very very unfortunate the game didn't just stop at the words ""The End"""

The trailor makes it out to be a sidescrolling platformer, but the sidescrolling shooter/platformer part is just the overworld.In TDH, there are no random encounters.  The regular overworld goons can just be shot by the Coffee robot.  The JRPG stuff comes from just 16 difficult, fast-paced, and strategy heavy bossfights.  During a battle, the player has to coordinate four slightly paranoid, hyper-intelligent AIs against a virus which the player is trying to purge from the four AIs shared network.Also, the story is really great, and the visual style is ridiculous."

I'm looking for items. No platforming in this area. Just left and right to move and down to interact with a sparkle on the ground. Suddenly, the game turns into space invaders. Green aliens appear above me and the game prompts me to press ""x"" to shoot them down. Why? Why here? I don't know. It just happens randomly. I feel like this scenario sums up my experience with The Desolate Hope fairly well.The items I'm searching for are given to other robots. Our cause is to destroy a virus that plagues our space station. These robots are extremely intelligent and were designed to simulate human life on this unnamed planet. It makes sense that they each robot fondly collects particular human items given their mission. One hoards clocks, another stashes paintings. They ""devote more of their resources to the cause"" the more you give them objects they like -- in other words, they level up.I like games that bewilder me. I like games that are surreal. Why am I a coffeemaker? I don't know why I'm a coffeemaker. With a full coffee pot, at that. Coffee sloshes around in your pot with each step you take. You'd think such a fragile thing would make a poor protagonist in the platformer parts of the game, what with enemies shooting at you, but I guess it's made of reinforced glass.There's platforming, RPG battles, and more. Take the ATB system from Final Fantasy games and inject it with steroids. That's exactly what you get during the RPG virus battles. They're probably the most frantic, explosive turn-based battles I've ever played. It's hard to really grasp what's going on at times, but I found myself doing well enough to win most of the time. The game isn't harsh if you fail; it simply kicks you out of the simulation you were battling in.The game is somewhat dragged down by the lack of an options menu, long loading times, and choppy gameplay during the RPG bits of the game. The thing that I find most baffling is that the escape key exits the game completely. It's such a standard way to pause computer games that I accidently exited out of the game twice. As far as I can tell, there's no way to pause the game.Do the game's wildly disparate gameplay types coalesce well? Probably not. But I think the ""throw things at a wall and see what sticks"" approach works for this particular game. I definitely recommend the game if you want something unique and with good character and environmental design. The platforming aspect of the game is pretty standard, but the rest of it is not."

Also, the game doesn't let you save your progress at will, and instead auto saves most actions and forces you to deal with failure. Yes, it does sound like Demon's Souls, and while there are no gameplay similarities, I felt it was worth mentioning how similar the atmosphere and pacing of the game was; the difficulty, too. Even if I didn't consciously acknowledge it at the time thanks to all the differences in gameplay, the atmosphere, pacing and structure of the game are basically identical to Demon's Souls, and that similarity really drew me in, and might draw you in. Anyways, the gameplay is unique, in that there are three sorts of gameplay (and small Zelda 1 dungeon style mini-dungeons); the solemn management and searching of the hub world night time management, when you enter a robot's simulated world, with the ruleset of a metroidvania shooter, and when you enter a boss battle, where you go into a turn-based RPG battle where accumulated, I guess I'd say, 'stat tokens' which you've picked up in the metroidvania gameplay add to the stats of all your characters during the fight. I have to say that the story, pacing, atmosphere and enigmatic nature of the game drew me in at the start, but I think that the game escalates the difficulty carelessly. You get some fast-paced challenging fights early on, but the game quickly makes literally every RPG battle consist entirely of one-shot attacks very quickly, ruining the chance to have a more sensible difficulty curve, and also making some boss fights simply too unforgiving.I would have liked this game, but the boss fights feel far too difficult. Seriously, it feels like you have to do things perfectly to win some of the mid-game and late-game fights, and it feels like the sort of design that is only intuitive to the developer.In conclusion, I really, really wanted to love this game. The bleak atmosphere and story, the spectacular characterisations of the Derelicts (the robots), their virtual worlds, and their fall from grace, the surprisingly great, if odd and idiosyncratic presentation, set in a world where humans have already died out, the combination of several genres, the lack of hand holding, and the very compelling story. I just think that the game's too hard, and personally, I can't say whether I recommend this game or not. I think I recommend it, solely because I want a sequel to the game so badly; just, hopefully next time, the boss fights aren't so ridiculous, and the metroidvania areas slightly more distinguishable and less maze-like."

I will say again, the other parts of the game are pretty... meh. They get less painful with upgrades, but the RPG battles are what makes this game memorable.

While nowadays we know Scott Cawthon as the man behind the smash-hit, near pop-culture, Five Nights At Freddy's series one of his first releases was The Desolate Hope.The Desolate Hope is a multi-genre game about a space station with only artificial intelligences around. The station was originally planned to house humans but there was never any contact made to say the humans were coming. Years after the expedition was supposed to happen a lone coffee pot robot is in charge of eliminating a virus thats attacking the remaning robots.TDH is a very extreme game, some things are very good and some things are very bad. The platforming sequences are (for the most part) rather bland and unengaging, the only exciting level would be Betagrid 0.9 but even it suffers from some poor design. Miradmoore is the absolute bottom of the barrel however, being an underwater stage with extremely slow movedment and exploration. This is made worse by the game's world timer, making it very easy to be booted from Miradmoore before you finish what you set out to do. The dungeon crawling segements fare no better, being extremely basic, rather unenjoyable or worthwhile, and feel more like just time wastes.In contrast, the JRPG boss battles soar high above the other gameplay faults. The combat system in the JRPG segments is extremely innovate as it contextualizes the use of keyboard and mouse, not only that but it's frantic and fast paced with some of the game's very best music.The real king of the game is the graphical presentation, Scott Cawthon has a unique, if not signature, design to his games and its originality is breathtaking. Even the most basic of worthless enemies have such a flair of animation that it comes off as a wholely different type of video game experience. Sadly there are some graphical misteps along the way.The Desolate Hope does not get everything right. It's story could use a little more fleshing out, perhaps a bit more explination of some of the item shops, and maybe a bit better design of some gameplay segments. But when the game is good the game is golden, shining far past it's sometimes below-average moments and offering a very memorable experience.Pros:- Some of the most wonderful graphics you'll see- JRPG battles are innovative and amazing- Fun cast of characters with a pretty good story attached- Otherworldly atmosphereCons:- Platforming and Dungeon Crawling segments are below average- Some graphical missteps along the way- Occasional poor level design- Can be quite a sporadic game at times, your milage may varyFor a more in-depth look at The Desolate Hope, please watch my video review linked above.- Mr. u Suk"

By the time I got around to it, the game went free-to-play, and now you have no excuse not to play it.The sci-fi premise here was a good one; without spoiling too much, a handful of AI's on a distant research station have a mission to run simulations to determine the habitability of a planet for human settlers.  Each AI has their own idea of how things will work best, and you get to experience each simulation through the course of the game.  A handful of intriguing twists are definitely what make this game worth the playthrough.The visuals range from beautiful, to awesome, to ridiculous, to near-seizure-inducing.  The characters are interestingly designed and their simulations are fantastically imagined.  The research facility and simulations provide interesting contrast with the surrounding barren landscape under the quiet vacuum of a beautfiul starscape.  The battle sequences can be a bit much, at times producing effects fully intended to make them basically unplayable for a brief period.Down to the gameplay, which was actually a lot of fun.  A pretty sizeable chunk of the game is presented in sidescrolling, platforming 2D.  You jump, shoot lazers, pick away at the story, and power up for your confrontations present in each simulation.  Those confrontations are frenetic turn-based RPG battles.  I must admit that even after completing the game, some mechanisms of those battles remain a mystery to me.  The battle display is a tad overwhelming, Information all over, attacks and effects constantly firing seemingly without reason, handful of minigames just doing their thing all at the same time.  There were a lot of neat design choices made here to make the battles seem very intense, while they really just boil down to most of the usual RPG elements served with great speeeed and clutter.The soundtrack has some really cool jams.  While shuffling across the surface of the planet at night, I found myself just a little disappointed if I didn't allow the groovy bass parts to get heard before getting back into the station.  Each simulation has its own own sound that fits the AI's prodcued situation.Above all the gameplay and art, If you can dig a good sci-fi, get this thing and enjoy yourself."

,Recommended,298180,15565631,"Posted: 26 April, 2015",all,deebee,"Still working on finishing the game at this time of writing this, on the home stretch currently.This is a curious little title, with unusual characters, setting, premise, among other things. You play as an AI from a video game system being repurposed for exterminating digital viruses, and you have a physical body on loan from a space station's coffee machine. The stated goal is to purge the viruses springing up in the simulations some of the robots on the planetary outpost/station which other AIs before you have generally failed. To do so, you need to work on numerous layers of your surroundings. As fair warning, this game really doesn't hold your hand, but does give you some room to experiment and learn what it is exactly that you need to do and how.As for genre, it's pretty hard to classify this as any single genre as it's a mashup of several, while not feeling particularly broken. There's meatspace (physical space, rather), where it's closest to an adventure title similar to King's Quest, in that you have direct control over a character with limited actions rather than click and point like, say, Monkey Island 1-3. In simulations, it's more of a platformer/shooter, to sum it up. When you get into the source code segments (I don't recall the exact explanation to what these are, though I'm sure the game mentions it somewhere early on) it's more adventure/shooter like the original Legend of Zelda. And when you fight bosses, it's sort of an Active Time Battle RPG but also upwards of 5 or 6 games going on at once, and this is where the game may be completely overwhelming while also being an amazing spectacle.It's almost beyond words to describe boss fights, I suppose the closest is what 80s movies predicted games in the 90's to be like? Either way, very unique, in a positive way. Character designs are also wonderful and range from beauty in simplicity to visually overwhelming and I love them all, honestly. The audio is pleasant and mostly appropriate for each area and segment, the game also does a great job of setting up just how grim the situation is without explicitly stating it.For criticisms, the game has pacing issues similar to a roller coaster, slow build up before going extremely fast until the bottom of the next hill. As for graphics, very subjective to whether folks will like them, I find em charming personally, but some may not enjoy the mid 90's-style pre-rendered sprites and animations akin to Donkey Kong Country. Difficulty for each part of game is also VERY drastically different, which can cause a little bit of whiplash. I apologize in advance if there is a manual that explains everything somewhere, but there's parts of the game and characters that feel as though there's probably context given in something extraneously, such as in a manual with a little blurb about the character and maybe backstory, but there's quite a few NPCs who seem to just be there with the only context being ""Hey, this NPC performs function X or sells Y or sells Z for a small fortune.""Overall, it's a rather unique experience and I'd suggest folks give it a fair shake. I've enjoyed what I've played thus far, and hope others enjoy it as well!"

The main character is a coffee pot (seriously) and it explores the simulations of the four Derelicts to scout for powerups, purchase abilities and prepare them for fighting the virus that threatens their existance. The game feels right at home with DOS classics like Fallout and Space Quest, despite coming out over a decade after those titles. The pre-rendered graphics and fantastic synth soundtrack are both phenominal and lightweight, and the RPG battles are some of the most visually stunning things I've seen in gaming. It's a carefully orchestrated combination of elements that binds the game together beautifully.The guy who made this game also made The Pilgrim's Progress, Five Nights at Freddy's, and the instant classic Fart Hotel.

,Recommended,298180,13630317,"Posted: 26 December, 2014",all,Lintire,"The Desolate Hope is a difficult game to both explain and recommend, but I fully recommend it. I only know of The Desolate Hope because of Cawthon's work, Five Nights At Freddy's. I didn't care for that, but I'm sincerely glad that it was made just so I was able to play this fantastic but flawed game.Flawed is even an understatement, it doesn't have a shortage of problems. The gameplay is split into 4 sections and 3 of them are boring to actively horrible. The levels are short and it takes only a few hours to explore them thoroughly. The game's progression is about grinding for currency to purchase every upgrade in the game - and every upgrade is needed.Gameplay sections in this game are neatly split into the following:• A ATB (Active Time Battle, think Final Fantasy VII) system used to combat a total of 17 enemies (18 if you count the training dummy)• Platforming levels used to navigate each Derelict's simulation and gain access to each of the battles, as well as purchase items from vendors hidden and not• Overhead battle arenas that are also hidden in the platforming levels to various degrees, but no less vital• A mandatory side-scrolling collection minigame in order to level-up your party membersComing to grips with each section requires experimentation and exploration. Unfortunately the game's own (largely forgiving but still present) time limit works against this, but without experimenting and trying new things constantly you can find yourself going around in circles unable to do jack squat.The ATB sections naturally steal the show, despite their relatively small amount of gametime compared to the other sections. There's a fantastic amount of depth, even taken on its own merit -  the buff/debuff based strategy means blitzing your way through the battles just isn't an option, and experimentation is forced to the point where I was coming up with cascading choices the likes of which I hadn't seen since Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey.Constant meter management lends the pressure needed to keep things hype, and the pacing between battles is ramped up perfectly - with the final boss requiring a ridiculous amount of strategy that incorporates everything that you've learned so far (and then some, it's a right ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥). Despite the game giving you every skill from the get-go, the pacing manages to thrive in spite of that, an impressive feat. The combat is just fantastically-designed overall.The rest of the gameplay is boring. Even actively bad at points.Platforming sections are simple scrolling events. There's no difficult or demanding platforming, no interesting or particularly varied enemy types, the movement itself feels slow and clunky with minimal animations and stop-n-go momentum. Even the upgrades that affect the platforming just alter it so you spend as little time as possible there.Overhead battle arenas are even worse. There's 3 enemy types, no interesting formations, and the mechanics themselves are horrible. More so if you don't find the hidden vendor. You shoot in the direction you're facing and move at the speed of a snail - it's not twinstick, it's not shmup, and it's not fun.Finally there's the collection minigame which isn't anything. Moving in the one direction and collecting token items.It's difficult to recommend this game because for most of it, you'll be slogging through one of those 3 terrible gameplay modes. You won't be coming to grips with the hectic, insanely indepth ATB system, you won't be admiring the fantastic art direction (which is the best art direction I've seen in an indie game, period), you won't even be stopping to admire the layered plot and the well-defined Derelicts, who make for interesting, distinct and likable characters.But if you're even slightly willing to force your way through those slow parts to get to the meaty core of this gem, then I wholeheartedly recommend you buy The Desolate Hope."

The variety of gameplay is great, and takes me back to DOS era games that tried to do too much, but were incredible and engaging regardless. The platforming is a bit clunky at times, but you ARE a coffee pot...I hope that my reccomendation only becomes stronger as I progress further in this game."

The mission was supposed to last five years, and probes with new research samples arrived regularily. With no warning, the probe cargo changed from research supplies to clocks, toys, paintings, snowglobes and other sentimental junk, they started crashing into the planet instead of landing at the base....then they stopped coming altogether.It has been thirty years since the last probe came. The station's power supplies are running low, and a virus is ravaging the AI simulations. You are a simple AI supplanted into amechanized coffee pot- which was included on an unmanned mission by mistake, but is now the last chassis on the station capable of movement, - and tasked with fixing the disaster by entering each simulation and cleaning out the infection. Things get complicated from here.This game is a true hidden gem that meshes together a small adventure overworld, a metroidvania, an Active Time Battle boss rush and several minigames, wrapped in an intriguing premise with interesting characters, catchy 90's-style soundtrack and awe-inspiring prerendered backgrounds.You can play a minigame inside of a boss fight inside of a simulation inside of a game. It's bizarre that it wasFive Night at Freddy'sthat brought Scott Cawthon fame instead of this.The game is not perfect, of course. The platforming sections are mediocre, the metroidvania part is a bit repetitive and there is some grinding required to gear up for the final bosses. However, the unique setting, atmosphere, graphics and characters more than make up for it."

The platforming is slow, isn't particularly challenging, and occurs within small, separate maze-like areas where you travel around and gain upgrades that let you explore further. The different areas are designed differently enough, such as one area being almost entirely vertical, which helps makes exploring a bit less tedious. The top-down shooter is accessed within the platformer, and is used almost exclusively for farming money which is used to purchase upgrades for the RPG segments. There's honestly not much to say about these segments, they're average at best and tedious at worst. The game follows a routine: platforming segment, talk to an NPC in the area, then go find the boss and engage in Battle. This allows the player to fight them whenever they want. Players confident in their ability can jump right in and fight, while others can grind a bit first.However, it's such a wholly unique experience once you're playing the Battles that it's worth playing the game for them.♥♥♥♥♥♥s flying everywhere, there's a racing minigame in the corner and it's making little squares appear, the music is remarkably unlike anything heard for an RPG about giant robots beating up another giant robot, numbers are popping out of everything, and the enemy just turned into a spring-y toy, only to come back and kill everything with a vaguely defined laser light show with names such as ""Intense Intensity"". I want to get into the game mechanics more but I feel that the Battles are best when you discover everything on your own, with the confusion you feel mimicking your character's as they slowly figure out how to  utilize the power of the Derelicts, who you control in Battle. The Battle system feels like the (il)logical conclusion to the Active Time Battle system, which is an RPG system where players take their turns, but only when their Turn bar has filled. You need to move as quickly as possible, make snap decisions, and deal with everything the boss can throw at you. It's the most active a player has ever needed to be during a turn based RPG, and it's just incredible at that moment when the entire battle system clicks into place and then you're that guy from The Matrix reading those green screens of gibberish. TDH follows after Shadows of the Colossus and as such the only enemy you'll ever face in a Battle are bosses, which is a double edged sword. It makes every Battle weigh more, since they're so limited, but they're also really fun so you want to keep playing them. If you needed a visual representation of how great the Battles are, this paragraph dedicated to them is more than 50% of this review.Oh yeah there's also night-time segments since the game actually runs on a day-night cycle. Anything I've described up until now can only be done during the day. At night, all you can do is play a training machine for mock Battles, and walk to the left and pick up various items that are extremely useful and play the occasional Space Invaders clone. What the ♥♥♥♥Game clocks in at around 9-10 hours, possibly more or less depending on your completion. It's short, a wholly unique experience, and only 5 bucks. Maybe Scott'll make a sequel if he's done riding the furry porn market for millions."

An amazing story hidden beneath a deceptively simple shell, equal parts XBLIG platformer and ultra busy fast paced RPG combat [yeah, I didn't even know it was possible to make an active-time battle thing this damned hard], it's worth an evening to barrel through to enjoy some mad AIs rambling about their new hobbies, and to see just in how many ways you can break the combat concurrently.It also has a spider in it."

Several of the bosses were extremely difficult prior to purchasing a few key upgrades, though."

Simulations in which the goal is to destroy a the virus,during the night phase the primary objective is to scavenge resorces out side the base on an alein world wich is indicative of leveling up your four robots to better combat the virus (Boss).This game gives you quite a bit of purpuse while at the same time personifying an atmosphire of hopelessness, if your not combating a virus your or saving your bytes (currancy)to buy some of the many upgrades your playing one of the sub games to unlock bonuses when you go after one of the five Bosses and keep an eye on that time meter its almost scavenging time, you are unabe to go into a simulation during the night phase and are unabel to go out to scavenge during the day phase which gives this game a whole other faceit making it feeling like a two differnt games, hey I dont know what a Giant simulation running robot wants with a snow globe but if he allocates more of his prosseing power and resorces to me (him leveling up) then more power to us, it's also a good idea to scavege power cells as your base runs on a power resivior and each day drains a power cell (After passing the tenth day, a few number of power cells can be found outside)I never found out what happens when you run out of power(came close though went down to 3 days of power left) but I can't help but feel somwhat sure thats when you lose and seeing as this game constanly saves there most likly wont be any ""loading up the save"" agin.The only thing I feel the game could have used was a mini map.In conclusion I give The Desolate Hope five Cyborg implants out of five (5/5) Fun gameplay, Awsome story ,Amazing Charactors and a strange well suited ending that brings it all together."
,Recommended,298180,19450616,"Posted: 2 December, 2015",all,Baphomet,"Coffee saves the day in this bizarre RPG-sidescroller hybrid, The Desolate Hope. In it, you play a small video game program tasked with exploring several unique worlds and battling viruses within as per the orders of a coffee machine tasked with maintaining the extra-planetary colony of Lum Infinis. To aid you on your quest, you have the help of four derelict robots each running their own simulation for you to explore.Gameplay is split between a megaman-style sidescrolling jump and shoot, a top down shooter where you explore cyberspace within cyberspace, and RPG-style 4 on 1 battles vs bosses. TDH features a really bizarre artstyle that I can only describe as “uniquely Scott Cawthon” and if you’ve played any of his other games (especially FNAF) you’ll see why. Another interesting feature of this game are the day-night cycles. During the night, you are relegated to exploring the surface world to scavenge for items to improve the derelicts, increase power to the station, or score a few extra credits playing a space invaders style mini-game. Daytime is considerably more busy, requiring you to dive into simulations powered by each derelict in order to seek out and destroy the viruses located within. Once you encounter a virus, you are thrust into a high speed active-time RPG battle where quick thinking and careful planning are required in order to survive.On that note I have to say that, while most of the game was a fairly interesting experience, the boss battles are incredibly confusing and I managed to clear each one without really understanding what was going on. There is just so much happening on the screen in any given moment and the bosses will interrupt everything very frequently to do a full-screen attack. In any case I won, but I have no idea how or why.Chaotic boss battles aside, I still really enjoyed The Desolate Hope and you probably will too if you like eccentric hybrid RPGs. Plus, it’s FREE (can’t beat that!)"

The art is truly amazing, a sort of nostalgic yet entirely unique style. The game itself is so very original, the plot is riveting and unique, and the gameplay is unique as well. In general this is a hidden gem nestled in the dark corners of Steam, and I wish that this was Scott Cawthon's flagship game instead of FNAF. I think it is a truer vision of his talent and creativity. I would reccomend this a thousand times over... this isn't a game, it's a transcendent work of art."

You do this while piloting a sarcastic coffee pot. It is that sort of game.This is...a dramatically odd bird. Mainly, it's a side-scrolling platformer/shoot'm-up. Mainly. But the boss fights are done as a realtime rpg format (And are insane - both fun wise and concentration wise), and the level of your fighters for it are based around a very linear scavenger hunt that dips into space invaders on occassion. And then there are small top down sections. just because XDIn a lot of ways, this game feels vaguely like Master Blaster, on the old NES, if smaller and with the added rpg elements. The game runs a couple hours, and has limited replayablity - I'm only really interested in seeing the ending again. But it's free, so...still totally worth it.The music is nice, if potentially repetitive, and the graphics are good, in a gritty way that re-enforces the themes. The controls are pretty solid, and the characters are interesting and weirdly believable. The difficulty is generally pretty good, though it spikes hard in the last few boss fights. under normal situations, these last fights are hair tearingly difficult - but certain secrets can make it a cake walk, if you are willing to grind money to a painful degree. Which is...kind of the worst of both worlds?The one other big downside is that the game has a twist...but it isn't hard to guess - the main thing keeping the twist hidden is that there are 4 or 5 other possible twists obscuring it.However, the game ends with a very good finale - including a monologue so good, that I cried trying to tell someone about it afterwards. It's really quite good.  I won't spoil it here XDAnd it's free now, so, why not?!"
