76561197970456719,Recommended,298220,10264528,"Posted: 28 May, 2014",all,IakXastur,"Graphics: For a large voxel, i.e. minecraft type game, when smoothed, looks really good, when in construction mode, blocky, still looks fairly good.Sound: Monotnous. At the moment, I've only noticed one track playing which is very ambient. The breathing you get naturally is annoying, but can be tuned out.Options: There are no real options at the moment, other than resolution, windowed/fullscreen, texture, and anti-aliasing. Definitely a point that needs worked on.Gameplay: For 3 arks in this game, the first two are relatively quick, and the third part, is just waiting. Overall lack of depth.Bugs: It is still beta, but I would say it feels more like a late alpha. Lots of glitches to the game. Certain people get horrendous lag in certain areas. Dissapearing items, and such forth.Overall: I would recommend this game with one caveat, if you want a polished execution of a game, at this moment, this is not the game for you. But, if you want to have some fun, in an adult form of minecraft, this game could be worth your while. Overall, if you are not sure of the game, I'd wait a while till you buy it, but definitely keep an eye on it"

Constant CtDs and no autosave make this an exercise in frustration, and annoyingly if you're interested more in the terraforming aspect there's no way to avoid a fairly tedious dungeon crawl early on.Infrequent updates don't help - going months between patches is not acceptable when your game is this unstable. This could be a great game, but at the moment it's a bug ridden mess with a terrible UI. Given the apparent lack of developer attention I wouldn't risk money on this while it's in Early Access.Edit: retried after release. Crashed to desktop within 10 seconds of starting. Don't bother."

You will come to appreciate the availability of oxygen, water, and food (which most of the time is just a spacesuit-not-needed-bus ride away).If you are not a space/mars exploration enthusiast, you will sweat and gasp even more (and possibly experience mental breakdown at some point), but even in your despair, something amazing will happen. You will discover a new kind of appreciation for your life on Earth (because you will realize how ****ty everything is millions of miles in every direction from Earth).Self-help taken to the next level."
,Not Recommended,298220,24617460,"Posted: 30 July, 2016",all,ins0mniac001,"I bought this game back when it was in early access to support what sounded and looked like an amazing concept (along with several other survival/colonization games of the time).  After years with no updates I had forgotten it was even in my Steam library.  Imagine my surprise to find that not only are there still no updates, but the game is no longer in early access.  What the heck, I'll install it again...Nope, looks just as bad as it did two years ago.  Crashes 3x trying to play the first 30 seconds of the tutorial.  So screw it, I'll try the real game - it can't be that hard to figure it out.  OK here are some metal plates and rods, I'll make a....shovel?  Surely that's the most important thing to craft when stranded on Mars...I now have a shovel, it's time to do some terraforming!  So let's see, I'll click on the dirt?  It's not doing anything but I can't stop shoveling....maybe I'll try to equip one of these steel rods instead, I can plant it upright and start building a shelter.  Oh wait, all I can do is put it back down just like I found it but look!  The crafting menu says I can make a hammer; we all know hammers are necessary!With my new hammer and trusty shovel I decide that I'll explore my surroundings for a place to build a new home.  After a 30 second jaunt around the planet, I return to the wreck of my ship and attempt to use my hammer on it.  Apparently this is NOT what you do to survive on Mars as Terraformer immediately stopped working.This is one of those games that has made me hesitate to give any money to early access developers in the future - it could have been great but they settled for mediocre.  2/10"

The only real issue I can see so far is its early stage of development. When you are constantly living in fear of the ""Falling"" glitch, that's something to be said for a game that tries to be so immersive that it plays you the song of your respirator's people.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, I'll explain... You have to constantly listen to your own breathing.Oh, you meant the game-breaking and ever-lurking bug? Why, that's when you hit terrain funny, or the edge of such, or the game just gets a wild hair up its♥♥♥♥♥ and decides that you aren't touching ground. You can 'float' along, stuck in the falling animation and gaining digital momentum,  until you manage to trigger either the same or a different bug, which forcibly helps you meet the ground directly under your boots, at terminal velocity. For me, it happens about once every hour. Could be more, could be less, and I often forget to save. That... is what makes this game unplayable in its alpha state for me. That one bug.Does that mean I say the game sucks juevos grande? No, of course not! Like I said, I like the direction it's going.  I like having to care for the suit and all your needs, (power, water, oxygen etc.) and feel it's a nice touch to differentiate it from other block-mining games, as well as giving the term 'SURVIVAL' its meaning.  The enemies, once you find them, I couldn't help but laugh at when I glanced through the forums and first found their lairs. The crafting system, while not very intuitive or flashy, works well, (I'd recommend mentioning to people that turning on a forge while holding it will kill them... and a better guide of what to do to advance your tech wouldn't go amiss. Particularly iron. Maybe some sort of mission parameters and planned actions tab on the PDA, like proper space missions. Could even tie in the milestone achievements in-game to it.) As with all early-access games, especially alpha-builds, this thing needs work. A lot of work. But... if this all pans out right, I got a good feeling about it.It's tough... but I'm gonna say I DO recommend the game, not for what it is now, but what it looks like the dev wants it to be."

Headphones HIGHLY recommended for immersion.EDIT: Update for so-called ""full release""Game is unfinished. It crashes, and has several bugs.  This is still, imo, a beta and not a full release candidate at all.My ""recommended"" rating was based on this being Early Access and still being updated.Now with unfinished ""full release"" I have to switch to Not Recommended.I may switch back if/when a major update fixing the myriad problems gets released.I consider the game unplayable at this stage."

The interface is just awful, the tutorial and guides are all but useless and the game crashes. A lot.Has the game improved in the past year? Yes. greatly.. is it worth getting? If you like survival crafting games? Yes. very much so. Is the game a full release? Nope. But they are very close.What this game needs? A more intuitive and streamlined user interface, a more comprehensive tutorial covering MANY aspects of the game in a virtual environment. A sequence at the beginning of the game in which your character crashes TO the planets surface. and of course... Less crashing :3This games' flaws do NOT outweigh what they have done properly so I DO strongly recommend getting this game, if only to support the developers to encourage them to update the game."

But the game is just... it's boring.I got this because of the premise, Terraform Mars. Instead I ended up being put in a game where you look at everything and think ""God damn who dredged this out of the crap heap?"". The features are good, yes. But the look, textures, poly's, bugs, learning curve are such major down points.I died 17 times trying to get enough materials to survive and set up a small shelter. 17.In most games you don't even get close to death before you've made a shelter."
