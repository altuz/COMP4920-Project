76561198172014086,Not Recommended,298240,30061731,Posted: 20 February,all,KOASA,"So when I played the browser version of CR2 I loved it. Then one day I logged on to find CRF. I'm like WTF is this. So I stop playing becasue I was so mad that I had just lost all of my progress. Then a few months ago I decided ti play RCF. I found out it was on steam,  so I downloaded it on steam. In RC2 I could get 120 FPS on high graphics with 12 to 53 ping. Now I get 40 FPS on low graphics and 120 to 350 ping. So that's why I don't play the RC series anymore because they ruiened it as soon as RCF came out. So Devs if you read this maybe you should take RC2 out of the back of your computer storage and put it back up so the people who liked it can play it. Also in the browser version of RC2 there was no chance of crashing unless your browser. Now in RCF I can maybe get one match in before it crashes. So all in all I think that they should relaunch RC2 as a standalone game. I didn't sit hear for 30 min of my Monday morning just so this could be reveiwed then forgotten. So take this into consideration I'm sure many people will agree."

,Recommended,298240,29454081,Posted: 23 January,all,JerryBomb,"Okay, this is NOT bad game, as far as gameplay goes. It's similar to the Battlefield series, you can get in tanks, helicopters, and jeeps. Or you can just run around on foot. It's a very cool game when you first open it. Graphics aren't the best either.Now the bugs. The bugs in starting the game are terrible. Sometimes I'm stuck on the loading screen and can't get past it. Sometimes game crashes randomly while trying to start it. Sometimes I'm stuck on the main menu and all the buttons disappear except the exit button. Frustrating at first. But somehow if I leave the game alone for a day, or even just a few hours, and I come back, the game runs normally. Pretty weird. A lot of other people are having the same problems in the discusions.But like I said, overall gameplay is fun. It's even funner with friends."

76561198342195288,Not Recommended,298240,29705080,Posted: 4 February,all,Andy O.,"Everybody is saying all the non reccomend reviews are from people only 20 minutes in. Well, I have over 100 hours of play time, so trust me when I say I know what I'm talking about with this game. Everything about this game is just completely retarde.d. There are lots of hackers in every server (which there aren't even many). People votekick you even when you didn't do anything at all sometimes, just because there is nothing to prevent people from doing that. And it runs absolutely terribly, not like a real FPS should. The spawn killing prevention in the game is broken. Sometimes you try to kill someone, but spawn protection applies when it really shouldn't, and often people do spawn kill but then the spawn kill prevention doesn't even work. And you need to use up a lot of actual money to be at all good at this game. The game is also filled with bugs. I do not recommend this game to anyone. Just getting this game for free is too much to pay. Though it's basically not even free because of all the needed in game purchases. This game is just horrible. And probably the worst part of all is that the developers do literally nothing to solve any of the many problems in this horrible game. They fix no bugs, ban no hackers, don't improve their game in any ways. All they do is create new overpowered weapons that you need to buy or else you will get destroyed so that they make more money. Not to mention the fact that I have been temporarily banned from the game twice now when I did LITERALLY NOTHING AT ALL! I just launched the sh.itty game to play more of it (though I really don't understand why I continue to play it considering how bad it is) and I was temporarily banned. The same thing happened a while later after I was able to play again. This game is just plain terrible and the devs of this game should honestly just be punished for making this game."

It's not the worst game ever, but with so many better alternatives out there, I can't recommend this.Instead, go play Team Fortress 2, or check out the Revive Battlefield 2 project."
,Not Recommended,298240,29638991,Posted: 1 February,all,victorymyel,"I loved this game when I first started playing... Then they introduced something called ""Unity,"" and the game went from fun to lagging, gliching, and not completely functional.  Where I was able to snipe through windows with bars in them before the update, the view is skewed and unusable for sniping now.  The white van in Favela is gray.Lag for me was not an issue, but now it gets pretty bad.I got used to playing it with all the dysfunction, and I do like playing it - BUT it is a game full of cheaters/hackers, and gliches that people learn to use against others (like shooting through walls, or stabbing you through a wall, or climbing on buildings that are not supposed to be accessible)... And with all the lag and video-skew, not to mention just plain meanness from many players, I don't understand why I keep playing it (lol).Complaining to mods or Rocketeer Games has absolutely no affect, and you will not even get answers in most cases.Moreover, unless you take screen shots, get the id number, and document everything like a police report, you cannot get hackers removed (they want screen shots but do not provide a way through Steam-Game Feedback).And lastly, it is pay to win... I have a job, so I can spend a little, so not so bad; but it is not really free - the free weapons and gear are far inferior to the purchasable ones."
