There was no way to pause it, (pressing escape does sort of pause it, but the talking carries on as if you're still playing, so you miss a lot of you had to go do something, thus having to restart to hear what you missed), no subtitles, the talking was really low, and for me, just overall frustrating. If you enjoy the game, then that's ok, I just didn't. Play it if you like this sort of thing, but I do not reccomend it at all."

,Not Recommended,298260,29416501,Posted: 22 January,all,Lucasen811,"I feel like this game really tries to be deep or something. I'm actually not quite sure because this piece of garbage ended up just being confusing and nausea-inducing at times. I honestly only tried this game for the easy 100% of achievements, but even those ended up being a hassle. Some of them wouldn't pop and required you to restart the game and retry the whole level in order to properly gain them. Overall the story is garbage, the gameplay is boring, the art style is dull and ugly and the achievements dont even work as intended!? AND! on top of all of that, I spent THREE HOURS TRYING TO 100% THIS GARBAGE! FML!"

However I must say that it can be extremely confusing at times. I had to resort to looking at a guide at times. I would avoid this game unless you have the patience to deal with the less than steller control scheme and the confusing puzzles.

Not that it matters because after a while you just 'die' anyway even though your pressing E, it doesn't care, start over!Add some kind of ♥♥♥♥ing direction or something, this is just aimless and frustrating!!!!!!!!Pros:- voice acting is cool- looks decent- seems like it could be funCons:- aimless wondering around while being forced to smash your E key every 30 seconds- maybe other cons too, i gave up cause it's aimless and frustrating!!!It is free, but i think they owe me a new E key :D"
,Not Recommended,298260,29752951,Posted: 6 February,all,Vermicelli,"Game doesn't seem to be playable.The character looked at a house, and then woke up in a room where he insisted at staring at the ceiling. If I held a mouse button I could temporarily drag his view downward, but it was a constant struggle, as he insisted on looking straight up. There seems to be no in-game way to exit the game (e.g. Esc, Pause/Break), so I alt-tabbed to another program in order to kill the game from the taskbar. I gave the game another shot. The second time, the character actually moved to the door of the house before the scene changed, but again he was fascinated with the ceiling. To be fair, the skylight was pretty cool, but it doesn't make for a good game."

,Recommended,298260,30233197,Posted: 27 February,all,srp4664,This game was quite interesting in many ways - it had interesting and sometimes complex puzzles (had to look up a guide for some of them) It has an interesting style that's pretty unique and different than the typical game experience. Plus throughout the game you have a strange narrator harassing you - and the ending is pretty funny too :p
,Not Recommended,298260,30226025,Posted: 27 February,all,Six56,"...Didn't enjoy at all.I found the voice acting and dialog to be annoying and poorly done.In my personal opinion a swing and a miss at trying to be funny.But I'm sure some people would like it.Can't really complain with a free game, but personally I'd strongly recommend playing something else with your time, but that's just me."

,Recommended,298260,29430119,Posted: 22 January,all,Assholemon: Eijo Joestar,"I wanted to give this game a neutral raiting, but steam doesn't let me.It's an interesting game to try if you're willing to go all the way through the game. It's an interesting experience even if the game is kinda short and the controls are not that good and it has a little bad design on some levels.btw, is it me or did some of the achievements are bugged?GameplayAt first it looks like a walking simulator game and I was expecting it, but then it added puzzles and some interesting sections. The puzzles themselves are quite nice, but a few of them we're confusingLike the one where you have to answer honeysince there aren't clues.As I've said few of the parts of the game lacked some good game design, since the game should be able to tell some of the clues, the game does that in the other parts and I've done them quite well, but in the case ofThe initial white pawn room there isn't a clue for the word honey or the immensity level since in a certain part the pots are quite spread and it's a little confusing to check which pot you should goOther than that the game is decent and the puzzles are interesting to solve.ControlsThey work, but some of them have delay and it can be difficult in certain levels.StoryThe story is focused on 2 paths, but it's one of those games that at the end it'll force you to go a specific path (which I dislike personally).Black pawn: This is the part where the game takes a serious route and you have to face the consequences of saving yourself at the expense of others, since you'll have to escape from a certain place and don't let some people to find you otherwise you'll die.This is the part where the game is logical, there's a continuity and it makes sense. This is the part that was interestingdue to the design of the place and the puzzles.White pawn: This is the part where the game starts to bring some mind♥♥♥♥s, which are very interesting to see even though some of them are kinda confusing, the premise consists of going through these levels in order to progress.This is the part where the game ♥♥♥♥s logic and you'll have some fun with it.But at the end of the game, no matter what you tried to do with the black pawn path, it will lead to the white pawn regardless. So much for multiple paths.GraphicsThey look pretty and do their job, the way on how levels look can be interesting. But I've seen better designs in some other placesMusicThere's not much of it in the game, some few songs but they do ther job and you'll forget about them as the same as I'm writting this review.OverrallAn attempt to be stanley parable in the white pawn path, a mysterious game in the black pawn, it's an interesting experience if the story grabs you. The ending is hilarious but the rest of the game isn't that memorable, althouhg the mind♥♥♥♥s are interesting.It's free so give it a go if you want."

Its great that they add a little hint of humor near the end of the game.Great concept about having to type certain keywords in order to progress.
