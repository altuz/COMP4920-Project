,Recommended,298280,10510989,"Posted: 17 June, 2014",all,Nashah,"Short version. The game runs perfectly fine and in my opinion this game is a great deal of fun. If you enjoy these type of games you should have no real gripes with this one.I picked up this title because it reminded me of another indie game that I did not expect much from but in the end impressed me more so then any other game this year, Ring Runner: Flight of the Sages. As I am now a fan of this genre I would have enjoyed this game even if it was only half way decent. That being said I do believe this game holds up on its own. The controls are fine, the gameplay is fast and chaotic and it is challenging.The only complaint (and it is a minor one) I have is that there is only one ship that you can pilot. I love having a selection to choose from. I can understand why they might do this though as it makes the game easier to balance. The biggest complaint I had with RR was that some ships simply out classed others rather then having there be trade offs of say like gaining something while losing something else. What would make this game fantastic is if they did have a few more ships though, like say a really light and quick one, a heavly armored slow ship, etc. and make it so no ship is clearly better then others but would give people the ability to specialize even more so.I don't really know what they plan to add in the future so my complaint might be unfounded."

It has a large set of weapons and customization parts which create a very dynamic gameplay and a huge amount of tactic possibilities. As mentioned before, the game is played through way to fast. To make this clear, you basically can rush this game (12 maps, approximately 10-20 minutes each) or you can unlock everything which results into 10 maybe 15 hours of total gamepaly, everything beyond is more of Scoring. Maybe a workshop would fix that.I have to admit the endless mode is quite a thing that keeps you playing.

Weapon customization is not only varied enough to be meaningful, but features actual stats (such as dps and heat usage) that you can compare to optimize your weapons to the fullest. Sound does its job and the music is pretty good, with graphics and particles being detailed enough without being distracting. Some weapon/ammo discriptions are just amazing. Did I mention that the theme of the enemies is that they are all saws? You can also paint your cyberdragon pretty colors to make it look as badass/stupid as possible. You are also a cyberdragon.If you're not convinced this game is worth $15 (it is), download the demo, which lets you endlessly replay the first 3 levels in full.

Make a teleporting, heavily armored ship with a chemical flamethrower, magnetic mines and a giant laser that goes BRAAAAAAAAM when you fire it. Or a super-fast ship that rams enemies, has a laser chainsaw and tactical nukes. Sky's the limit.Negatives-Some weapons are flat-out better than literally all the rest, and you'll find yourself coming back to the same few setups, especially if you want to progress. Using the asteroid-throwing flamethrower, mind-control beam, plutonium gatling beam, etc. just results in a less enjoyable experience. They do less damage and/or are highly conditional in their use, and when you switch it up, you get destroyed by the difficulty when you can no longer dodge in any direction, or your weapon can only hit something 2 feet in front of you. This seems to suggest the player creates his own difficulty, and I get that, but I just found it more frustrating than cool.-Each level is pretty much the same thing, with the difficulty escalating to ludicrous levels by the latter half of the game.-It's not worth $15. I got it for $4, and considering what you get, I wouldn't pay above 6.Recommended with a steep discount."

And, as you get further on, it actually becomes more difficult. Weapons are balanced and situational, and you actually have to consider what matches your playstyle. But not only that, you also have to consider how to take down enemies, because if you go all out mortar, then destroying the heavier hard-hitting ships will be easy, and the slow moving saw-swarms, but those fast moving ones? Well, good luck with that.However, the game can be challenging sometimes. And that can, depending on what games you enjoy, really get to you.The learning curve... It's kind of in the middle. The basics are easy to grasp, pilot your ship around, kill enemies. Easy enough. But mastering the dodging, without killing yourself in that asteroid you forgot was there, now that takes time.I'd say it's a good game. I find it overly addictive. I can't say much about the multiplayer yet tho, as I haven't tryed it, but shooting up aliens with your friend, both as powerful spacedragons? Not every game lets you do that... I'm just saying..."

This is one of thebesttwin-stick shooters I've ever played. All the other games are either side-scrollers, or that Flash-game esque 2D arena shooter (Fracture, Geometry Wars, Waves, etc) type thing, or nostalga♥♥♥♥ trying to re-live the ""glory"" days. This game says ""♥♥♥♥ technique and♥♥♥♥ conventions"" and proceeds to throw a plethora of upgradable and fully configurable weapon and equipment systems at you at the speed of ♥♥♥♥. On top of the weapons, the fixed camera angle is just right, there's also a mode that follows directly behind you, and there's even a ""sniper mode"" that allows you to see out further in both major camera modes.And trust me, there is a metric ♥♥♥♥truckton of weapons. Even the base weapons alone are enough to keep you kinda busy, but then you start finding not only size but damage-type modifers, some with unique effects, and figuring out what best suits your play-style or if you just want to see how much damage you can do in a single volley. Also, yes, those numbers next to them, nearly all equipment is upgradable.Also the equipment drops are set up nice too. If you only get to wave 5, the mid-way boss, and beat him, and die on wave 6, you still get a part, andallbosses have drops. Yes, you will have trouble until you find better equipment, even on regular difficulties, but it's not very grindy, and you'll always get drops until the table for that boss is completely dry, plus action isveryfast-paced, meaning you'll never get bored if you're getting into the zone at all.My only complaint about this game is a bit of needed ballancing between the different weapon systems, but that would take time, and if overdone, it may take the fun out of getting something like the Nuke, The Only Way To Be Sure™.Early-access games go from anywhere from 10 to 25 dollars, and this one is absolutely worth 15. It is nearly a complete game, in fact. Maybe I haven't gotten far enough to find any missing details, but so far it has been worth every penny. Much less a game withexactly one author, aside from the engine and maybe some stock assets....What really gets me is that this game only has 50 reviews or so.

After about 15 minutes in the demo I was convinced I would enjoy this game, and it did not disappoint.It's the little things that make this game good for me. It's satisfying to blow things up, and knowing that there's a variety of ways you can do so. The sound and hit physics effects are my favorite part. The sound effects are beefy. Bullets and missiles crash into metallic hulls, explosions really shake the subwoofer, and there's a lot of pewpew for good measure too.For most weapons, the target may not explode immediately, and they blow up later. During this time you might even see them wobbling out of control. A hard hit from most weapons will knock them off their path, possibly crashing into something. This combined with the great sound effects really feels good, so much that I often find myself trying to set up good angles so that I can inflict maximum carnage per shot.The weapons have a lot of variety and some of them are quite entertaining. If you're patient you can even drag asteroids or bigger enemies around to smash into groups of smaller enemies. It's arguably not as damaging as simply blasting enemies straight up, but it's very fun. Also, as people have mentioned, you can teleport fighting bears into an enemy cockpit. It's crazy damaging and the target ship will float around unpowered and out of control for a time after the bear has done its work, giving you an easy shot to finish it off. You can also replace the ""payload"" with bees and stuff, if bears aren't your thing.The enemies you encounter have a fair amount of variety. There's swarms of little enemies that you can't ignore, bigger enemies that often have heavier fire power, and annoying enemies that dodge or go invis. They also use a variety of weapons and tactics, from straight up ramming you to long-ranged missile barrages. That said, it's probably wise to make sure you bring a weapon for various situations within a level, as the enemy types will often vary per wave in a level.Friendly fire is always on, even for enemies. That said, you can use it to your advantage. Enemies crashing into each other, hitting each other with their bullets and explosions, etc., means that your movement and positioning are important.Speaking of which, the controls are super responsive. Turn rate doesn't seem to be an issue at all (unlike some twin stick shooters I've played), as your ship will immediately face/shoot where your mouse pointer is. The pointer is also fairly easy to spot even in the midst of bullets, explosions and debris, which is important since some weapons are designed to travel or explode where your mouse is currently located. All in all it's designed very well in this aspect.All in all it's a solid buy even at full price. It's the kind of pace with customization that I'm looking for, and if this were an arcade game I'd probably be sinking way more money into this than its asking price on Steam."
