It's not Wipeout, and it's not trying to be Wipeout.From that standpoint, it is well made and I enjoyed what the game is actually about. The craft partially steers itself, and your job is to adjust your position on the track to pick up powerups and use them at the right time. It's not about getting the perfect raceline, it's about aggressive weapon usage and activating shields when they're really needed.Other reviews cite control issues, but I think they've been fixed. I had no trouble after I fiddled with the settings. The music is great. The voice acting is bad enough to be funny."

The racing is very bad. There is no acceleration. The sound effects are stilted, the music is generic, the cutscenes are sub-par, the lighting is over-saturated.And it has a generic Unity Settings Launcher, which is just tacky.Is this a good replacement for Wipeout? No.Is this a good racing game? No.Does this make it a bad game overall? No, but definitely feels disingenuous to bring this to the PC platform."

It reminded me alot of the old Wipeouts from PS1 and looked well presented ,and faithful to its obvious inspiration, on the store page. Alas it seems like a bad port from mobile platforms, atleast it is presented like it and plays just as bad. The gameplay is basically done for you, you can't even turn around on the damned track if you wanted to. It basically auto steer's and aims the same. I came wanting a game faithful to the old wipeouts, and the advertisements promised it, and were presented pretty well, but not at all reflected the actual gameplay. In all, plays like a bad mobile port, presented like one too (on a platform that shouldn't), is completely devoid of any challenge and gamplay that would have bought most people here, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥izes it's inspiration."

Some examples:-the first level of the Redox League have infinite lap loop bug. All you can do is hit escape and surrender on this level (you will lose points). The league is still beatable but it does increase the difficulty a bit because you don't get any points from this round while enemies does,-you can't finish the game because the last boss battle (Shadow) never loads,-almost half of the achievements are broken. some of them just don't work and rest of them are counted wrong. There is achievement for obtaining 500k money. I definitely reached over 500k but on the achievement site it does say I have just 400k.Lets go to the PROS and CONS.PROS:+good gameplay similiar to Wipeout,+pretty good graphics and does work on slower machines,+low price and frequently on sale,+awesome music (atleast for my taste),+online multiplayer,+DUKE NUKEM as one of the BOSS characters!CONS:-broken achievements (examples above),-alot of bugs (examples above),-steering is pretty weird sometimes it does randomly move your machine a little into left/right,-DUKE NUKEM was too easy... Come on guys!So the game itself isn't bad and I would vote it 7+/10 but at the current state I will rate it BROKEN/10! The last patch was there around 3 years ago so I guess it will be never fixed."

It almost reminded me of a less complex variation of FzeroX for the N64. It was pretty fun for a few races. Then the glitches started pouring in. The basic AI functionality seems flawed to its core. Some races are unwinnable as AIs hit the improbability drive to appear at the finish line while others appear to forget that they left their parking breaks on at the race's start line. Normally I could find some of this forgivable, however once I made my way to the proverbial final boss level... Well the level just wouldn't load. I tried reloading it several times and changing every setting I could to no avail. This kind of coding error is unforgivable. Very disappointed and a bit suprised at how poorly this game was made for the PC."

As I traverse the menu's they can be a bit clunky and sometimes it selects the wrong thing. I have no way of inviting my friend to join my match. We queued together several times and it was working great. Now, we select to join a match and we just sit for 50 seconds without our computers finding eachother.

The game could definitely use some track variety as everything ends up kind of looking the same, and the graphics and weapons aren't anything to be too wowed by, but the soundtrack is pretty awesome electronic tunes, and the gameplay is at least fluid and fast-paced.

This game tries so hard to be Wipeout but ends up being a crappy F-Zero rip-off. A really bad one at that. The car designs are horrible. Little kids in 5th grade art class could draw and color better looking hover cars than the ones in this game.The music isn't too bad but it's nothing special, mostly just dance songs. The cool dub-step song in the trailer isn't in the game. It can be entertaing to play a couple of races but after awhile it's just tedious.The difficulty level increases too much after the first few tournaments, even if you have a better car than the rest of the grid they will still out-pace you in the beginning of the race, and then you just have to slowly catch up.There are so many different neon colors going on in this game you're going to puke after playing for 30 minutes straight. For some reason the developers thought it would be cool if the track constatly changed colors. WTF??? Despite what the description says the graphics are not good in this game. They are like IOS games. From far-away, wow it's pretty good, and then close-up, it's complete crap. The only reason you wont notice the crap graphics most of the time is because the freakin' game has major bloom effect going on and it's all just a blurry mess. That isn't how you make a game look cool ffs! Even the backgrounds are complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ On the France level there is a 2D Eiffel tower. Really? it's freakin' 2014 and you have 2D images in your backgrounds??Oh yeah and the voice acting... WTF also. It's really bad and sounds like♥♥♥♥♥♥ One of the rival characters in the game is Duke Nukem for some reason, it's just stupid.And guess what? The weapons are just plain bad. You cannot tell if the 'guns' are actually hitting, most of the time they miss and then sometimes the enemy will explode in 2 seconds like you hit them with a death-ray. The 'rockets'(really smart rockets are dumbfire, missiles have guidance systems to lock-on, they can't even name the weapons right) require a lock-on mechanism to hit the target but it's a total piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ once again! It will lock and if you don't hit that button right away too bad it breaks lock and your 'rockets' go into a wall. And quite often if you get a lock the damn things wont even catch-up to a freakin' enemy. And if the enemy racer hits a jump while your 'rockets' are following they will disapear... WTF!Only buy this game if it's $0.99.I will give it 1/10 for creating a sense of speed at times and the music is decent. Everything else is just crap!"

Not sure why there are so many mixed reviews - it seems like most folks on here are biased against racing games anyway, so I think that's why.The controller works just fine (there's an options menu off the main menu where you can choose input) and it's got a great soundtrack. Graphics are good enough - sure, it's a mobile port so the graphics *could* be better on your uber:pc but you know what this is a low budget racer and its not like you're paying full whack for it - the graphics are good enough and when you're whizzing down the tracks at a zillion mph you should probably be concentrating on the gameplay instead!!I got it on sale, so I'm super happy with my purchase but I don't think I'd be too disappointed at full price.

The interface is unintuative and provides no information on how to change which vehicle you're going to pilot. The tutorial tells you what to do, but not how to do it... ie. buttons are not displayed on screen during the tutorial.  Also the ""Failed"" pop up screen during the tutorial doesn't accept gamepad input. There is no victory ceremony after having won a cup. The voice acting is on par with House of the Dead as some of the worst I've ever heard. The empty multiplayer lobbies do not allow you to invite Steam friends to race, leaving you to race A.I. bots in multiplayer. Even with all of it's shortcomings if they had only included local splitscreen multiplayer I would have been happy, but they didn't.

Fo2 has the same feel in terms of speed and turning, but the graphical environments are not as ""cool"". I understand the criticisms of this game, but for less than serious gamers, Fo2 is quite entertaining. The 1st single race for the Redox trophy has some sort of code bug which causes the player to be trapped within ""infinite laps"", never going beyond lap 1. Of course I did about 50 laps, made 100,000 ducats, but quit the race, lost the money...I figured out how to get beyond the bug by winning the other 4 races for the tourney after quitting the 1st one. Red Swan is beatable; one just has to be perfect in terms of hitting all the speed boosts, laying mines in the right place, and collecting Nitro powerups. (You can figure out how to do that exactly without me spoiling it completely). Also, Fo2 is much better than the racer simulators found through Linux repositories; using WINE is a security risk, so we linux folks make the best of what games we can currently use for our platforms and flavors.  Finally, maps with long straightaways (London) are actually...soothing; there might be a market for driving simulators where the object is to just ""chill""."

As someone who never buys AAA titles new if ever, I don't see any problems with this game. There is a settings menu at launch that allows you to change graphics and key mapping. Using a Gravis GamePad Pro works fairly well. I still have to use the mouse when I finish a race to go through menus, but I will admit I didn't bother trying to mess with the settings that much since it worked well enough for me. The axis keys wouldn't set, but they were automatically picked up by the game. The settings launcher before playing seems to make whatever is selected invisible (white highlight with white text), but this is a Steam issue and I haven't tried it on any other operating system.The game itself is interesting. Not what I would call easy. The crafts are like hovercraft, so it isn't precise steering like with tires. If you REALLY like racing games then you will probably like this. Especially with a controller. If you aren't a huge racing fan and no controller then it might not be for you. I picked this up on sale and really couldn't understand all the negative reviews.
