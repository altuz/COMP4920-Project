They know their audience and they know what flash games should be about: easy to get into, but hard to master fun.Check out the flash version on Kongregate or Armor Games before you decide to buy. If you enjoy it, Juicy Beast well-deserve your money for this rebuild."
,Recommended,298400,11421165,"Posted: 26 July, 2014",all,VioletLips,"This game has been criticized for being a flash game, originaly avaiable for free. While it's true that there is a free of charge flash version, the one avaiable on steam has been completely rebuilt on the Unity engine. Now, moving on to the acttual review.Knightmare Tower is an arcade style game. You play a night going up the tower to save 10 princesses and ultimately deffeat the boss at the top of the tower. Seem's pretty bland, right? It would be, if not for the way you ascend the tower is by hitting your enemies with your sword. You basicly fly around at the top of the screen, slowly falling dow until you hit an enemy or dashing straight at them so that you can get up again. It's the type of arcade game where you're gonna keep failing until you purchase the right upgrades.Speaking of upgrades. While ascending the tower, you will keep finding stuff that'll aid you in you journey. Bombs that'll deliver a hit to each enemy curently on the screen, horn that will spawn odd, non hostile creatures you can wack down to go up higher and gain some gold and, well, bags of gold. The last one is obviously used to purchase the previously mentioned upgrades. Those are chategorized as: Equipment, Upgrades and potions. Upgrading your equipment will make your rocket go higher, make you able to withstand more damage or deliver it or just make your movement more fluid. Upgrades are less noticeble, but they still help you a great deal! Potions are another item you can find, and upgrading it in the store will keep adding effects to it like speed or damage boost.The game features a variety of different foes. From the harmless demons you use as fodder for your sword, to weird, centipede-like things that you can only hit in the head. Some ill shoot at you, others will blow fire, some others will just use spikes to protect themselves. You've gotta be carefull and time your dashes just right to nog get hit. Also, it's important to note that if you dash and hit no enemys you will fall of the tower. A rocket will quickly get you back up, but you will lose a great deal of your speed, wich will leave you vulnerable to the biggest foe of them all. Lava. Lava will start following you if you don't ascend the tower fast enough. It doesn't mess around. If you fall into it, game over, no matter how much damage you can withsand.So you've gone up the tower, saved all the princesses and and defeated the final boss. What now, you might ask. Well now, you unlock a survival mode. The tower is infinite in height and the monsters more fierce than ever! This is where the ""endgame"" begins. If you want to squeeze a bit more out of this game, you'll have a lot of fun trying to get into the leaderboards! Now, the monsters in this tower are always the same, and the only thing that changes is their health, spawn rates and the speed of the lava, as you go up the tower. Make no mistake, though, this get's real hard, real quick!As for achievements, the game only has 6 of them, wich will propably turn off anyone who look's to bump up their achievement count, but if you're looking for a challenge, you're gonna find it here. Sure, finishing the game and getting everything there is to get in the shop aren't hard achievements, but getting up to 100.00 meters in survival mode? Good luck.Honestly, I cannot reccomend this game enough. I am having tons of fun with it, and I bet most of you will too. Happy gaming!"

Must have played it literally a dozen times.So partially to support the devs and partially because I was curious about a few new features of the steam version, I purchased the game.I was pretty disappointed to discover they removed mouse controls. Why on earth would you do that? Keyboard controls suck for this game, and I hardly think the game is better played with a controller.Apart from that, the game is still pretty dope I guess and I would love to see part 2. But unplayable for me without mouse controls."

It's really minimalistic in its controls, but the way it's executed makes it an intense game of skill with a little bit of luck.Here's a quick look video if you want to see gameplay with my impressions of it. If you'd rather read, just continue below for generally the same thing.http://youtu.be/agdKUVMg00oNow before I begin, I'll say you can play this game for free online with pretty much all of the same content. But since it's good to support the devs, you can play it on steam with a better resolution, smoother gameplay, and a controller, which is very much worth it. It also serves as a good demo to see if you'd like the game. Now with that sorted, let's continue this review.So what is this game? It's about a knight flying up a tower off a rocket and his enemies' face. Why does he do it? Because he wants a harem of princess like any good chap.Okay, maybe the concept is silly. I get that. But great feeling of progression this game gives is fantastic. Every time you fly up the tower, you amass gold for when you die (and you will die) for the next round when you upgrade your stuff. You can upgrade your sword, health, rocket, potions, luck, and plenty more to give you an edge to make your way up the tower just a little bit farther. Every so often as you scale higher up the tower, you'll reach a princess who will give you a bonus powerup/enemy that'll make your life easier in the next runs. And you'll keep this system up as you fly farther than ever before, encountering harder and more challenging enemies the higher you go.And that's pretty much it. But while it's so simple, it's a ton of fun with great replayability. It's doesn't even grindy at all since the game has no problem awarding you with gold so you can get that next powerup. There's even achievements and quests that give you side objectives for even more gold. It's really a great system.If I had anything to ding this game for, it's just how short it is. You'll probably beat the main quest after 2-3 hours. But it does give you a survival mode, so you'll have something to do after that.But all in all, this is a solid $4 game. Worth every penny. It's mindless fun and a joy to play."

I have always thought it was best played with a controller and now that's finally possible for me since I don't own an Ouya anymore and it's didn't seem as fun on my tablet (not a fan of tablet/phone games).A few minor annoyances.1) Menu navigations seems off. After you finish a round you can either ""shop"" or ""restart."" No back to menu, save/quit, etc.2) No graphics options, unless I'm missing something. VSYNC being the only thing it really needs from the get go. I ended up turning on adaptive vsync through Nvidia control panel. This definitely needs to be put into the options somewhere...Unless I'm missing it somewhere.HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I would have paid $10 for it."

,Recommended,298400,32477300,Posted: 16 June,all,Endyo,"The interesting thing for me about Knightmare Tower is that it was one of the few games I played first on the Ouya.  However, despite being on the not-so-great Ouya, it played well and was a ton of fun.  So much so that I bought it again on Steam, even with it being the same game.  That’s not something I believe I’ve done very often when you exclude remasters.Knightmare Tower is a simple game, one I believe first came out on Android and subsequently migrated to every platform that would have it.  The Steam version of course allows mouse control that I think feels a little more responsive than using a controller.  The game itself has you launching yourself up a tower and attacking/jumping off enemies that pop up from below to keep yourself propelled upward as lava (for some reason) chases you from below. You gain gold and rescue princesses that you use to upgrade yourself to go faster, do more damage, and accomplish more in general.  The end goal is getting to the top and fighting a simply designed yet challenging boss.It sounds very basic, and to some degree it is, but it’s a well-polished experience that is still challenging and felt like a much deeper game than it actually was.  It just makes me wish that Juicy Beast would bring more games to Steam given that they are still actively developing them.  If you think you’d be interested in Knightmare Tower but don’t want to shell out the $4 (or whatever the sale price is), there is a Flash version of the game out there – assuming Flash hasn’t fully died by the time you read this review.  So you can use that to gauge whether you want a more complete version with all the progress that comes with an installation and saves.  Either way, Knightmare Tower is a definite recommendation from me, and I hope the developer has another game planned for Steam sometime in the near future… maybe Burrito Bison: Launcha Libre (pls)?If you'd like to see more of my reviews, check out my curator page here:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/EndyoGaming#curation"

A king had his princesses kidnapped and you decide you can rescue them and they will fall in love with you. You launch yourself up a tower on top of a rocket and then freefall. The goal is to kill monsters to keep you from falling and they boost you higher up the tower. You will break through ceilings after certain heights reached which will rescue a princess and with that tougher enemies show up to bring more of a challenge. When you rescure a princess she will unlock a bonus for you that may show up when you kill the enemies. Stuff like bombs, health, money, and potions.After each time you end your game you will have money to spend in the store to unlock stuff like health, better damage, and better speed boots for example. When you unlock health and damage it will change the look of your sword and armor. Not much but a cool little feature.Once you save the last princess you will need to beat the boss. He's does give a little challenge but nothing to tough. After that you unlock survival mode where you try to climb as high as you can. In this mode enemies are tougher and it can get crazier in battles. Achievements were also pretty easy to unlock if you're into earning those.Overall I had a good time playing Knightmare Tower and found it well worth it's asking price. I did pretty much beat everything in one sitting and most likely won't play the game anymore but that doesn't take away from it's fun and value."

Of course, I clicked immediately.I first checked if the game gives anything new compared to the flash version. Although it does, finally I decided I don't care, because this is a game that's developers deserved the money.I really liked all of the new features, I think the combo is a much better idea than that multiplier-anything in the flash version. The new textures for the potions are great (for example, a feather in the potion for the Levitate effect), too.I found it harder to defeat the boss (which is hilarious) in this game. A lot, actually. But I say it is good, because when I played the flash game, I mostly ended up with the game being beaten and I'm only 60% or so maxed.

Also sometimes your controller just won't be there even though it worked fine for many games before.  And the full screen is never sized right you have to window it and then go back to full to make it size right.

Lee,"As some of the reviews suggest; This is also available online as a flash game.And thanks to those reviews I remembered I've played it some years ago, and did have some fun with it.The gameplay is simple, yet addicting like hell - Especially if you want to 100% this game.You move your knight from left to right, enganging enemies in a never-ending fight.Well nearly never-ending. You ""level up""/""gear up"" your knight in the shop with money earned and picked up during gameplay, which helps make the game more compelling.However, it's pretty simplistic but in a way that suits the game decently.Since there's only one type of weapon and all enemy attacks (those who have it) deal the same amount of damage, there is no reason for a more ""complex gearing/leveling system"".Which brings me to the pricetag. I only bought it because I was looking at some brief fun but most importantly: I had a 66% off coupon.I would NEVER consider a game like this (without trading cards) with a pricetag like this when you're done with it after ~5 hours.It may sound harsh, but the reality is I'm not sure if I'm ever going to play the game again after completing it.Atleast the developer put in a ""Start new game"" feature which might help in replay-ability.Which again brings me to my next point.. as others have already stated, you're not able to rebind the controls.You'll quickly learn them however, and I only found it frustrating once I broke ""zeh purhfect g4m3"".You're able to pause the game with Esc - However, if you want to resume, you have to press space.If you press esc it restarts, and if you press enter you'll enter the shop (or vice versa - Sue me, I can't remember haha).Overall the game did its trick - I ultimately had fun with it.If you like casual games, with simplistic gameplay and ""level up system"" this might rock your boat.The graphics and animations, in my opinion, are great.The sound/music is also awesome, however there's a slight audio glitch with the final potion making overlap noises if you stack them.The game doesn't crash or anything, it just sounds weird when the second potion is about to wear out)."

All the monsters in the game slowly evolve depending on how far up the tower you go, and their models gradually become more sinister but also more detailed.The gameplay is very much reminiscent of Burrito Bison (another game I enjoyed a lot but unfortunately is a flash game and not on Steam at the moment), mainly because it was also made by Juicy Beast. It shares similar game mechanics, where you make your way from a point A to point B while defeating enemies and collecting money. You then use this money to upgrade your equipment and thus can get further in the game, and collect more money and repeat. The main twist on this formula however is that in this game you travel up instead of to the right.The amount of content in this game is very surprising, as it is a decent price and does not look like much. However, the wealth of interesting upgrades and unique quests will occupy you for hours. The enemies progressively get harder and more plentiful, the death lava at the bottom of the screen rises faster, and the game generally keeps you on edge and stays challenging. There is even a boss fight included in the game.You will feel very satisfied when you finally purchase that last upgrade or get to a floor you've been struggling to get to for a while. In the end, in order to 100% complete the game and get all achievements, you will have to master the Survival mode, which is infinite and will test your skill immensely.Overall, a refreshing and unique take on this area of arcade games and I am definitely looking forward to more games from Juicy Beast, and maybe even Burrito Bison on Steam? :D9.5/10"

Check out our video review here!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf9iAqAgX8IThe popular flash game now has a full release on Steam. Knightmare Tower is a simple concept that is executed with little flaw. It's a game that boasts accessibility, but can still be challenging to experienced gamers. So brandish your blade and fuel up the rocket, we don't want anyone falling down the tower.Knightmare starts with a simple story; ten princesses have been kidnapped and need rescuing from a tower. The tower is in control of... let's just call him Boss, and his monsters and minions will do anything to keep you from reaching the damsels.The gameplay however is quite unique; You are launched from a rocket and propelled into the air. Monsters approach from beneath to attack you, to which you can perform a downward slash with your sword. Slashing enemies propels you further into the air, with the idea of gaining higher speeds and maintaining momentum. Without hitting enemies you will eventually lose momentum and fall in to the quicly approaching lava, causing your run to end. Monsters can also end your run by attacking you and depleting your health. Forcing you to attack monsters as soon as they appear, as opposed to letting them act first. This adds a madness to runs as there can be tens of monsters chasing you up the tower at once. Bouncing off their heads becomes very satisfying and fun.Knightmare Tower is a roguetype, meaning its broken into runs and after each run you have the chance to spend your loot on upgrades. Such as: better armor that increase your health bar, a better sword that deals more damage to difficult enemies, and potions that can be found during your runs and improve your character in some way for a short  time. This means many runs are needed before having the necessary equipment to take on the boss. There are also quests that can be completed on each run. You have multiple attempts at the same three quests, adding more challenge for players who want it. After each quest is completed, you are rewarded with gold, and a new quest takes it's place. There are dozens of quests in the game to complete, but none feel out of the reach of experienced players.Reaching certain points in a run, will let you break a ceiling, and pass through to the next section of the tower. Higher sections of the castle have slightly more difficult enemies than the lower sections, but become much easier with upgraded tools. Additionaly each ceiling you brake through rescues another princess; who has a special power attached to her. These powers show up in bubbles during runs. When attacked these powers activate and can have varying effects. Some just deal massive damage to enemies on screen, while others summon mini bosses. This changes up the gameplay and helps it feel fresh, even after a few hours in.The main game isn't very long, but you would be leaving a lot behind to stop after rescuing the princesses and defeating the boss. You probably won't have all of the gear upgrades, and a survival mode is unlocked after beating the story, with all new quests. There is easily another couple of hours after the main story of things to complete, and many of the Steam achievments demand more playtime. The replayability of this game adequite, and the games design is fun enough that completing a story is somewhat in the back of the gamer's head anyway. This game is just fun to throw on and play.Knightmare Tower has tight controls, a fluent artstyle, and an addictive gameplay. For under five dollars this is a no brainer game for anyones library. You will be hacking a slashing monster for hours without slashing your bank account. If you played the flash version, or are new to the franchise, you will not be disapointed.8.0"

You spend a good part of your time debating on if you should:  A: Quit the game and take a break (or) B:  Go just one more round, to see if you can get those few extra coins to update your character... which may make or break you rescuing a princess on another round.  If you choose B and then have enough money at the end of your turn, you are then faced wth another series of A / B choices on if you want to go just that 'one more round' and before you know it... you've wasted more time in this game than you wanted to.  :)My hats off to the developer for this great game.  I have really enjoyed it not once, but twice.  Game is very well made and greatly polished.

While some of the challanges can be luck based as you need to defeat a specific monster which requires a specific drop to summon. The game never felt boring or dragging while I was waiting for the item I needed to drop.The controls are simple and sharp, though I have only been using a gamepad and not the keyboard. The sound and music are great too rounding off a simple, but fun game."

Even though it's more likely a mobile game, it's much fun to play on your pc, too (there is a port though, but the controls are weird as you have to move left and right by tilting your phone). The graphics are nice and high-resolution featuring a cartoony style. The game has an ordinary story, where you are a knight that has to release the princess, however, you have to climb a huge tower with evil creatures and many mini-bosses. So far so good. There is a shop system that provides you upgrades at reasonable prices, but once you are done with the main story which doesn't take too long, sadly, there's no need for you to ever visit the shop again. In fact, there's nothing that really binds you to the game anymore. There is still an endless mode but that's something for 5 minutes of your spare time when you just can't think of doing anything else, but still, it's a fun game to play.I like the game and its style so there's nothing that really prevents me from giving it a good rating...I'd give it a9/10-as the story is pretty shortHope this helped ;)~ 0MoGa0"

BUT, with that said, it is completely worthy of being on Steam. This is a great game. You'll have hours of gameplay, a great progression, a simple and comedic story, and a great soundtrack.The premise, while simple, is completely explored, and there are numerous upgrades, enemies, levels, potions, and bosses to keep it interesting. The controls are smooth and the art style is amazing. Overall, worth the money. If you're not sure yet, try out the online version:http://armorgames.com/play/13831/knightmare-tower"

Then saw it in steam, but I think 4€ is quite much for game you could play for free as well. Then wild summer sale appeared, and this game was crazy discount, so I bought it.Listing pros and cons is not my style, so here's my review:This game is very addictive if you ask me, worth of few currency units (LOL). Very colorful game, large scale of different enemies, and boss fight is actually quite challenging. Achieving all achievements shouldn't take more than 6-8 hours, and I'm not pro at this game myself. Even after you have completed story mode, there's still plenty of quests in survival mode, and for the (probably) your last achivement you must travel crazy amount upwards in survival mode.Overall rating: 3.6/5"

It's worth mentioning that this game was originally a free flash game online that has been updated a little and put up on Steam. I didn't even know it was on Steam until I wound up with a coupon for the game.It's a fun game and a nice little hidden gem if you are into arcade-style games. It's worth the price of admission, especially if one of your many coupons is for this game."
