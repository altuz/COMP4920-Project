,Recommended,298520,20492643,"Posted: 12 January, 2016",all,Unpageable,"Since you are probably skimming through the reviews to make up your mind on a purchase, I’ll save you some time and summarise this game with three words, they are cheap (price tag), stylish (graphics) and fun (game play). If that wasn’t enough to convince you, read on.This title is essentially an arena game set upon a 2D platform with 3D graphics, the twist revolves around the clever implementation of gravity around structures and planets, with which the players will use to maneuver their mechs. The system can be confusing at first, but very rewarding once a player gets the hang of it, I was pulling gravitational slingshot and performing swing-by shooting within an hour.The guns themselves are fairly mundane and standard among this type of game, but the twelve of them do vary a great deal in terms of play style and tactics. There are four utility tools available as well, but I rarely see people use them to much effect in game.As for game modes, you have the basic Death Match which is self explanatory. Then you have Orbital Warfare, a territorial tug-of-war in which both teams race to charge up their main cannons for a devastating blast. Lastly you have Orbital Trials, a single player time attack mode that pits you up against patrolling machines on a map with limited weaponry; this was added by the developers after much request from the community.The only problem I had with the game was the lack of bots, so if you just wanted a private match with a friend or two, the arena would feel very desolate. Other than that I felt the community could do better with a few thousand more players, so it would be easier to find games during different hours of the day.The asking price of 10 USD is fine, but if you find this under 1 USD during a sale, it would be a practical steal."
,Recommended,298520,15034280,"Posted: 24 March, 2015",all,sideways408,This game is alot of fun and within about 2-3 hours of playing i went from being horrible to being better then 75% of the players iv come across.+Fun game to play with people.+You can play a few matches and quit and feel satisfied.+Creative skill shooter with planet physiques.+Game loads quickly.+Good variety of different weapons and depending what weapon you choose decides how you play (If you are good anyway). For example if you use a shotgun-esque weapon then you will be trying to close the distance on people and blow them away. I use a long range electricty weapon so i try to keep my distance while using my secondary weapon the phase orb to force people to move in the direction i want them to go. I have ran across some people who are really good at placing mines which was very effective against me. You can place turrets but i have not ran across anyone who does really well with them yet.-At night i have a hard time finding people online to play matches with which for me anyway makes the game worthless until someone comes online to play with which can be a long time since you are probably not going to log in and stare at the screen for hours until someone logs in. So more then likely you are going to log on and if no one is online playing you will close the game and try again later.- Single player seems kind of pointless to a certain extent and is not very much fun (Although i did score in the top 50 on one of the levels).- The maps get repetitive especialy in single player.- If the game had a bigger community i would think the $9.99 price tag to be fine but since the community is so small i think the game is worth 3-4$ at most.

Even when things were the busiest back in the earlier days more than 5 games going at a time was very rare.

It has some great elements, but also some flaws that prevent me from recommending it.Pros:+ Unique idea+ Gameplay is quite fun at the start and unqiue+ Good soundtrack+ Nice art style+ Weapon, map, and ability varietyCons:- The community is almost dead. I couldn't find anyone to play with on the North America servers and very few people were on the EU servers. This was at about noon on a Saturday.- The gameplay would probably get boring or repetitive after about 3-5 hours at the maximum. I got pretty bored after an hour, partially due to the lack of a community.- Not worth $10.Overall, it might be worth it for the 99 cents I paid, but the lack of community and the fact that the game gets repetitive and boring after a little while prevent me from enjoying the game."

,Recommended,298520,16046540,"Posted: 28 May, 2015",all,Hitaro,"Orbital Gear is a fun fast paced shooter with some really fun design choices.Pros:[+] Guns are satisfying. There are 12 in all, and each one is very unique. Using a different gun feels like using a different class in Tf2, and each one has a satisfying hit. There are a lot of high impact weapons, so dieing is quick, but so are respawn timers so there's very little to no downtime.[+] Movement is great. It takes a little bit to get used to the gravity mechanic, but once you understand how to manipulate it in your favor, sling shotting yourself across the map feels really great. There are single player time trials to help you learn them.[+] High skill high reward. The nice thing about the game is that it's consistent. There's a lot of room to learn the movement system, a lot of room to learn how to position yourself relative to certain guns, aiming with projectiles has a ton of depth, and overall just being good at aiming + Reaction is very rewarding. Some combinations will seem overpowered, but then you realize that there are counters to most everything and most things are pretty balanced. For example, when I first got the game it seemed to me the gauntlet was the most broken weapon in the game, but after a couple hours you realize that it gets absolutely destroyed by any of the shotgun-esque weapons and overall just positioning.Cons:[-] Very little lag compensation. Servers are player hosted, and even when playing with people who have relatively low ping, (like 20-50) you'll have people teleporting their locations. Super frustrating and honestly the biggest negative.[-] Lack of feedback. There's  no indication of whether or not you hit somebody else. You can shoot at someone multiple times and have no idea if you've actually damaged them. Not usually an issue since most weapons tend to be very high damaging, and most of the time 1-4 shots will kill someone (lending to the fast paced nature of the game, but would be a nice, easy fix.[-] Small Player base. I've checked other server regions a couple times, and asian /australian regions have no servers usually. American and European servers tend to have a couple servers running so if you live in either of those places it should be fine.Verdict: As of writing this the game is on sale for a dollar, and at that price the game is absolutely worth getting. I see it's also been in packs and bundles before for a couple dollars and that'd also be worth it. I personally wouldn't recommend the game for 10 dollars, but just a little bit off of that and its an amazing deal."

It's not worth it otherwise.This game has a lot of potential. But it rarely does anything with it. The gameplay mechanics are great, online and local multiplayer is fun, the many different types of weapons provide many different ways to play, and once you get used to the unique movement mechanic, it's an amazing feeling to use gravity to zoom around different ""planets"". But the game just doesn't feel finished. It lacks things that I feel are basic to this type of game. It has no ""normal"" single player (which I'll expand on in a minute), no minimap of any kind, and really only 3 types of gamemodes.So, there is a type of single player, and it's not that bad. You just have to kill a certain amount of enemies in a certain amount of time, and unlock weapons as you go. But the annoying part is, this is the only type of single player. There's not any mod where you just pick a world and dificulty, put in bots, and just have a deathmatch. Yeah, there's that in multiplayer, but multiplayer has it's own problems. First off, it's hard to be a ""noob"" in mutiplayer. A good amount of these people have gotten pretty good and using the weapons, utilities, and maps fully to their advantage. Not to mention, the community is tiny. For the whole US, there's usually only one game going on at once. Only one. With maybe 8 people. Not a huge community. Yeah, multiplayer is fun, but since it's so small, they should add more gamemodes for single player.Gamemodes are another thing. There are only three. One for single player, and two for multiplayer. I personally would love seeing modes like survival, juggernaut, etc.Now, as you can see, I am recommending this. That's because, with all this missing, it's still a good game. At least, it has it's moments. When you're playing locally with a friend, it's a great small game to have. And, like I said, the gameplay mechanics are pretty good. It just feels more like an early access game than a finished game.So, overall, it's not a great game, but it's a good game. It can be fun to play sometimes, and it's a good game to mess around with friends. However, it feels like it's missing simple, easy-to-add things that would make it a far better game. So, feel free to get it, I'd just recommend getting it during a sale of some kind."

Sounds simpel, and yes, sometimes it is just that simpel. But the planets you jump on have gravity that effects everyone, meanning you have to take into account that if you jump you might not move up, or if you miss a planet you may end up slingshotting yourself halfway across the map. The offline time trials provide a fairly good introduction to the base mechanics but i found that trial by fire in multiplayer did more for me. Because it is really in the multiplayer aspects this game shines. The weapon and map variety is also nice. So far all the levels seems fun and with great opportunities for frantic combat. The guns also seem different and handle different with i quite like. That means that every gun will require a unique playstyle and offer different challenges.To sum upGameplay: 8/10. The gameplay is excellent if you are looking for a fun and frantic little 2D shooter.Weapons: 7/10. The weapons are nicely varied and well balanced, i do however have some personal issues with the some weapons. Namely the Phase orb.Sound: 6/10. The guns sound good, the music sounds good and the annoucer is not annoying. All in all, very good.Levels: 7/10. All the levels are small enough to put you close to the action while still allowing for breathing room.Looks: 8/10. Everything looks excellent. The background in the leves looks nice and fits with every level, pretty enough to catch your eye, inconspicuous enough to not be distracting. The weapons looks nice when fired and so does the projectilesAll in all: 8/10. Execellent game"

The concept is great; mechs in some sort of 2D space-theme shoot-em-up with massive stellar bodies and varying gravity, but throwing in non-optional and timed ""orbital trials"" just to unlock weaponry is annoying...The Best:- High quality backgrounds, backdrops, and environments (sort of a must-have for any 2D platformer style games these days).  If the trials weren't timed, I'd probably appreciate these graphics even more...- Sky is the limit (or space) as far as ""how good you can get"" is concerned; get comfortable with how the gravity works, how to move around, and be able to switch weapons when needed, but reaction-timing and coordination are serious game changers.The Good:- not terrible digital/techno style soundtracks- challenging fast-paced gameplay- rather challenging movement (in order to complete trials in a timely manner or be reasonably competitive in multiplayer, you'll have to be able to sling-shot around stellar bodies to get to some locations)The Bad:- TIMED TRIALS: you HAVE to follow the progression to be able to unlock each subsequent weapon, regardless of preferences in playstyle- Hit boxes: time and again, thought you just hit that enemy?  Well, it sure as hell hit you.- Lots of different ""Gravitational Bodies,"" but none of them labeled or any inkling of the effect they will have on your or your weapons.The Ugly:- At least on PC/Mac, the keyboard controls are very difficult to get comfortable with; you can hold down the left or right arrow key and start running around a planetary body, but go to jump off or use a thruster and the arrow key held down still dictates your direction (even if you've run around to the opposite side)- No apparent variation in the stats of the mechs to fit different playstyles (slow and tanky, bruiser, fast but weak, etc.)- Timed trials are exactly the same each time; no variation in enemy behavior asside from scripts relating to player position means all you really have to do is get familiar with the layout and weapon characteristics and play a level over and over until earning 3 stars.Overall:As far as controls are concerned, I'd like to atleast have the option to keep the player ""upright"" constantly, and rotate the screen as you move; otherwise my personal opinion is that you HAVE to have a controller with an 8-direction pad for the movement to ever really feel natural, and a monitor refresh of at least 120hz.  Otherwise, as many would agree, if you're looking for a fast-paced, intense, and dynamic 2D game, Orbital Gear is probably for you.  If you get irritated easily when gameplay isn't particularly intuitive and you don't care for timed-trials (like myself) then Orbital Gear isn't.  If you can get past the timed trials, the multiplayer can be a lot of fun, as long as there are enough people online..."

Allow me to explain:In Orbital gear, you are some sort of giant robot, walking the surface of suspiciously small worlds that are placed odly close together. Using gravity, you jump from world to world, and using a small assortment of devestating weapons you hunt down other mechs and turn them into spaceborn scrap. It's not a complex game plot-wise, to the point I'm not sure it even has an excuse plot, but that doesn't make it less fun. The gravity physics are a bit magnetic, a nescesary thing to make it so that the game is actually playable, but once you find out how to work around and against them, it's awesome. In one match, I was able to launch myself into orbit, got a gravitational boost from 3 planets, exploded an enemy with my flamer, and killed myself by launching myself out of bounds. It was awesome.Now for the part that makes it terrible: there are no players! I hovered arround for ages, just experimenting with the game physics and waiting for someone to join the server, and when one finally did, it was this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ whose entire strategy boiled down to, ""Hide and use the seaker missiles to do my work for me."" Later I managed to get a game going with something like 6 people, and it was awesome, but that was the exception rather than the rule. Another complaint, one that wouldn't be so bad if not for the first problem, is that the single player mode sucks. I honestly didn't even know there was a single player mode at first until I clicked up the time trial option, and even then it's kind of a crappy game mode. If they had taken the time to create a single player mode that's just like the real game but with AI opponents I wouldn't have any complaints about this game, but instead it's so multiplayer focused that it can't stand up if nobody's online.Verdict: I love this game, and the only reason I could complain is not enough people love it for more to love it.

Haven't had a chance to try multiplayer yet bet the trials alone clearly indicated we are working with some glorious game mechanics.  Swinging around the orbits of little planets lends itself perfectly to the run and gun gameplay.  The graphics/explosions/particle effects are all dialed in nicely.  Some great special effects on display with enemy attacks.  This is Soldat in space, as has been said.  Best purchase of Holiday sale.Update: Just got into some hectic multiplayer and Orbital Gear did not disappoint.  This is a perfect game as is according to my own gaming criteria.  But the monkey mind says, maybe some dlc that gives customization options to your char., maybe a lighter faster class or heavier class more hp and some ""rpg"" options would get playerbase more invested.  Gameplay is perfect but without customization I fear for longevity."

Fast-paced fun. Highly recommended.However: there is basically nobody playing on the public servers... so if you buy this game, get the 4-pack and give copies to your friends. Otherwise you'll have nobody to play with. Since there is no single player mode and no bots, having opponents is a requirement.The game has two modes: a free-for-all deathmatch mode and a team mode based around capturing objectives. The deathmatch mode is fun and works well but the team mode feels incomplete. For example, there is no direct feedback when you hit a target with your weapon. It's also nearly impossible to find enough players to organize teams... so practically speaking, you'll only ever play the deathmatch mode with your own friends."

I'm not even that good, and yet, I still am laughing and having a blast whenever I decide to play it. It's fast, frantic, and wonderfully competitive, while being as simplistic as possible at the same time. I highly recommend this game. Get some friends together, start a Skype chat, and play. And now, until June 1, it's available for just a $1!Pros- Even when running at maxed out settings, it runs ridiculously smooth. Plus it looks gorgeous and has a perfect, distinct style.- The controls, while at first are frustrating, quickly become very familiar.- The use of gravity as a main gameplay element was actually pretty well implemented. Not perfect by any means, but it works for a majority of stages in the game.- The variety of weapons and stages is great. Each stage and weapon feels distinct. Having a favorite pairing of weapons, and a utility (a sort of enhancement for the user's mech) and then proceeding to master that loadout, feels just like having a favorite Smash Bros. character.Cons- Having controller support as an option may in itself sound great, but using a controller for this game sucks. It just doesn't work.- There are a number of different mechs to choose from from within the game. They all look different, with a great retro 80s 90s vibe, but the mechs themselves are just cosmetic, and don't really change anything. Plus within the game, they appear super tiny, so that was pretty useless.- Lack of replayability. Everything is already unlocked in this game the second you turn it on. Weapons, mechs, stages, everything.Anyways though, these cons are very minor as a whole really, and don't in anyway hinder the amount of childlike fun with this game. 9/10"

It adds something new to the world of gaming. A completely different challenge to master. It has examples from other videogames but this game puts its own spin on things. I got lost in this game for hours and I will continue to do so.This game pushes you to the edge of your seat. Flying around makes you cackle like a maniac. Flying by people and raining down hell from whichever weapon you see fit for your play style. It really is a great time when you have a full server of chaos everywhere you look. All while orbiting around the planets strategically placed throughout the maps dodging death at every moment.I wish more people played it much like everyone else has stated. I think if people put down their big AAA games they would see there is a wonderful gaming experience to be had in the smaller games. The ones that test the waters of something new while still remaining familiar to anyone who jumps in.If you stuble accross this game please give it a chance. Also tell your friends!

The weapons are cool and there's nice variety there and again the gameplay and mechanics are great.I like how this game plays but good god is it lacking in content. I got a 4 pack for $3 and that was arguably barely worth it. There's only 2 modes you can play multiplayer which get old fast when there's hardly anyone online playing and no AI whatsoever.This game could have more longevity if it had a survival mode or any sort of multiplayer mode with AI. As it stands now the only thing you can do in single player and with AI happens to be time trials. Doesn't get more basic than that.

At the beginning I didn´t know how to get started, but after I figured out what to do this became interesting. The interface, translation and design aren´t the best, but singeplayer was fun to play and not too easy. The basic idea of creating a gravity-based top-down-shooter attracted me; and they say the multiplayer was way better than the campaign. I would love to try it, but so far I couldn´t. If the multiplayer mode is that nice, this would probably annihilate the two big cons I still have: Explanation and price. What I can say according to price is basically, that I guess this game shouldn´t cost 7$, as it looks like a free to play game. I payed 69ct and that influences my opinion a lot. If the developers would sell this for something around 2$ then this would be a fair deal and it could help increasing the number of players, resulting in an active Mulitiplayer community. For the other point I wish a tutorial or something, because there´s a huge lack of explanation. It might be pretty hard getting started, as it happened to me, for example.Oh, by the way, the soundtrack is pretty good, did I mention yet?"

Musics are below standards, they sound like electro music from someone who just discovered how to make a synth work.I haven't found any bug yet, but that's the least of my concern : the game is nominated in the category ""worse lag of the year in a multiplayer game"", with around 1 to 3 seconds of lag between input and feedback. Figures it's VERY HARD to hit your own foot with this kind of delay, not to mention hitting an actual enemy player.

Running around planets and jumping from one planet to another is really fun. Especially if you have the booster equiped and time your boost right and send yourself flying around the map, sometimes doing more than one lap.All the weapons function differently and are all fun to use in different combinations. You gets standard guns like the chaingun which just shoot in a straight line, and insane things like the phase orb which shoots a massive ball that can phase through planets, has it's own gravity which pulls players into it and is prone to pulling in the player who shot it.The lack of online community is a big downside however, so if you do intend on getting it, I suggest having a few friends get it too.

Seriously, when you're weaving through the planets in an epic duel with some other tiny robot this game is at its best.There are plenty of guns, equip items, and robots.The bad:People only ever play the deathmatch gamemode from what I've seen, but that doesn't matter really, for reasons to be stated shortly.The time between games isn't long at all, and while there isn't much to do between games, I'd still like more than a ten second break, because once in game, it can take a while, especially with low player numbers, for someone to win. I suppose you could just not respawn for a bit or something, but that defeats the purpose and is beside the point.Because of that, I only ever play for 30 minutes at a time.The lack of bots isn't frustrating, not yet. A game destined to have a small playerbase like this needs them though. If I'm in a lobby and suddenly there are two of us instead of eight, I'd like for bots to take their place.So that all being said, this game is really fun when it shines, and I have no *gameplay* issues with it. The gravity flying about thing is really fun. I follow the 1$=1hr rule, so pick this up while its on sale: I can't recommend it full price.

This game is easy to play but difficult to master. You will think that you mastered the level but in next upgrade (with a different weapon) you may suck in the same level. It requires some good skills to master.And Online play (boy! Oh boy!)...  There are ppl who will kill you twice in a blink of an eye. Too good.

This is a good game missing a playerbase. You might find one or two servers sporadically at any given time throughout the day but don't expect much more than that until one of the steam sales.There are two multiplayer modes: Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch which I'm not going to bother explaining. What I will make note of however is that in multiplayer, all players are given access to all weapons in the game, which you can switch out in between lives if you'd like which makes for a level playing field with the only deciding factor in matches being player skill.There is also a very loose single player mode which is basically a time trial consisting of clearing a level of enemies as quickly as possible for up to 3 points (3 if you're quick, 2 is you're so-so, 1 if you're slow.) You start with the default weapon and progress through a set of different levels with progressively harder enemies. Once you've  accumulated enough points in a set you open up another weapon class and repeat. Though again this is meant more for getting a player accustomed to the mechanics of the game and becoming familar with the weapons, so it lacks the intensity and enjoyment that PVP matches have.All and all I recommend this game, but not for $10 given it's lack of a playerbase despite the games heavy reliance on needing one to keep it's replayability since it's a PVP game first and forermost. I bought the 4 pack of this game during one of the steam sales for 90% off and felt it was a bargin, even if the game is dead 85% of the time. So pick up the 4 pack when it's 90% off and give it a go with some friends.Also, if anyone on my friends list ends up reading this. I've had 3 copies of this game sitting in my inventory for the past two years waiting to be given out god damnit."

,Not Recommended,298520,34362034,Posted: 19 August,all,I Solve Problems,"It's surprising to me how this game is no longer an Early Access title. Ultimately, Orbital Gear just doesn't deliver that feeling of ""like your first rocket jump in quake"" as impressed by the trailer. Why? Because there are a few game-breaking issues that, while not game crashes from bad code or glitches, still kill what would otherwise be an enjoyable ""timewaster"" game.Controls. Let's put it like this: Orbital gear is basically a console game that the dev's can't afford to create exclusively for consoles. any type of keyboard/mouse layout is clunky, inefficient, and ultimately frustrating to use because the game mechanics lean so far towards controller use that it alienates any gamer confortable with the good 'ol WASD.Controller Support. You'd think Orbital Gear, with its controller-based menu graphics and emphasis on controller gameplay, would actually tell you what sort of controller is supported, or would even detect the fact that you're using a controller... Nope! So far, controller support for Orbital is down to groping in the dark for some elusive configuration that might actually make controller gameplay feasable.UI/Graphics. Yes, Orbital Gear has stunning landscape graphics. However, the UI is too small to properly navigate at times. In addition, the most important features of a graphical UI (some buttons, THE CURSOR YOU USE TO SHOOT AT ENEMIES) are often rendered to be near-inconspicuous, a deadly flaw during even a caricature of battle.singleplayer ""training..."" This is one of those games where the developers decided that, instead of giving customers an actual usable singleplayer experience, they could just foist a series of ""training"" time trials on buyers to somehow satisfy the singleplayer gamers' outcries. There are no bots, no real tutorials, firing ranges... Heck, there isn't even some sort of ""campaign"" to introduce players to the many varied weapons and gadgets, which even with the corniest, shallowest storyline would do much better at training players for online combat than the current ""feature"" of time trials.Ultimately, Orbital gear, while a semi-intriguing gameplay experiment, is not worth the $10 ($9.99) to buy it. Sure, get it on sale, accept it as a gift from someone, but until the developers improve the positively minor yet gamebreaking flaws of this timestealer, your money, steam funds, or credit is put to better use in your wallet."
