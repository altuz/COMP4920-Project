Very pleasant to look at. The ships and weapons are fun to look at as well, especially considering the fact that you can build them yourself. The character portraits are nice, as well. The whole game just very, very charming._Sounds great: The lasers all have the pew-pew sounds that somehow never manage to sound annoying even though you hear it all the time. The music is deffinitely a highlight as well, it's quirky and fun and really fits the rest of the game's style._Is great: The game controls well with an Asteroid-like control scheme. Ships feels appropriately floaty while drifting in space and fast while zooming around at full speed. A nice variety of weapons to tailor to different playstyle. The Lego-like ship building system allows you to assemble, disassemble, and reassemble your ship at any given time. It's gratifying to salvage parts from enemies to make your ship bigger. Also, very skill-intensive as you try to destroy the enemies without damaging their parts too much (so you can claim those parts for yourself). It's can also be heart wracking to frantically replace destroyed parts of your ship while under enemy fire. Did I mention the variety of things you can unlock overtime? Like new starter kits of ships with different upgrades? It's great.Cons:_Can take a bit to get used to: While the game controls nice and tight, the Asteroid control scheme took me a minute or two to get used to._Lacks a sandbox mode: As far as I know, there's no free-build mode here. It would be nice to just infinitely build the most ridiculous ship in relative peace.Is it worth 15 bucks? Abso-♥♥♥♥ing-lutely, John. It's fun, deep, charming, and pretty. What else would you want from a game?"

Just like the browser version, the game has a sandbox mode where you can slowly progress, and you can save your previous ships. In this version, There are starter kits and other features. Another huge difference is the story element. While it's not long, it adds alot of character to the game. The story is simply a brother and sister, Rollplaying together, and you get to battle through levels of opponents as they throw banter back and forth at eachother. Overall i would say that i do reccomed this game, and would give it a 8/10 due to how unique it is and the replayability to it."

Right before this game came out on steam I heard about it- A REMAKE OF THE OLD CAPTAIN FOREVER BROWSER GAME! This caught my eye, as I played the original captain forever and I loved it. I got this game when it came out and let me tell you this, it. Is. Hard. If you thought that the original was hard then wait until you play this! Sure it is sort of cheap with a huge difficulty spike from orange to red but it is challenging, it wants to make you cry, and it makes you want to play more. If you liked the browser game (which is free and you can try right now atcaptainforever.com)and you want more, play this. BUT, do not expect this to be as easy as the original!"

Even though there isn't a lot to offer, it's the kind of game you lose hours to, even just from the basic kit. The extra kits add more depth and give you even more options to play with, which are all fun and interesting.

It's done in under half an hour atm. Not OK! Think of Bosses and infinite Modes!It's fun in general. Nice idea and some nice tries, but after a maximum of 5h this game is just plain boring. I get that it still is in early access, but the general concept of this game wont make it work out any better. It's barely any fun replaying this game after having seen every weapon once. There aren't many, and even if there were a lot more, they don't motivate to build any real ship. Simple designs triumph rly badly over the more complex ones, since you have to rebuild your ship every minute and you don't have a lot of time to do so. Even if u had, ur ship parts lose any value they had upon the next level."
,Not Recommended,298560,28792588,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,mipper,I find the gameplay and mechanics not very entertaining.9 out of ten fights consist of endles circling and near misses for a minute or two (Both you and the AI are circling .. near miss ... flyby ...a couple of shots hit the target ... rinse and repeat). This circling is very boring.And sometimes you have an entertaining fight between equals and suddenly the enemy hits you and 90% of your ship explodes and the fight is lost. This happens due to the many modifier blocks that add special abilities. But it feels just random and unpredictable.I was looking for a game with a good ship building aspect (like Reassembly). But the ship building is random due to the fact that you have to collect your parts from the ships that you destroy. And in most instances those parts are badly damaged or completely destroyed in the attack.

And then you snap pieces you find or salvage to it, buildig a bigger and bigger craft. But there ends the similarity.CFR is a fast paced spacecraft builder, where you must use what resources you find, and rebuild whenever you have the spare time. Because, if you wait untill the end of the round, you might have too little time. Often you get so wrecked, that you have to improvise to survive. That can often be a bit frustrating as you often have no way of recovering from a deady encounter. But that's the theme of the game: Childs' play. You smash your ship to bits and build it up again. Like at least I did when I was a kid.Childs' play is also the theme of the game. A girl and her brother is playing the hero and the villain in a fantasy world. While it's very well made, both in graphics, comments and music, I miss the small parts. Maybe having a real voice would be the icing on the cake. But it could also have ruined the entire experience. The graphics is also very functional, only a few tidbits pulls the impression down.As for gameplay and replayability, it's one of those games that you play again and again to see if you can build the perfect ship. Only to see it gets wrecked by a too tough opponent. And that is what pulls the score a bit down. I feel some of the opponents are impossible to beat, and if you are unlucky, you cannot outrun them either. When you compare them to some of the other variations you meet, you can also very lucky. Getting a cube without guns, or without thrusters. For the campaign, I feel that could have been a bit less random, as you also have the sandbox mode. A bit frustrating, but after playing too many a Rogue-like, I'm used to hitting dead ends."

I used to love that game, i played it every weekend and couldn't wait to get home from school to play it. There are so many good things in this game from Custom Ships to Randomly Generated enemies.PRO'S- Custom Ships- Leveling system- Ability to upgrade- Money- STILL IN EARLY  ACCESS :D- Even when you get absolutely destroyed, if you still have your core you have a chance.- Varying areas that get more difficult as you progress, Slightly like The binding of isaac.CON'S- You can go from being an absolute boss in one second.Thats all!Probably worth more like $10, but if you have $15 and this is the deciding review, Buy it like hell!"

Buy this game!Early access stability:A few minor bugs will still pop up (but this review was written in early-early access). Some collision issues and some minor crashes but other than that totally playable and fun as s**t!Story:A very neat premise in which you play the older sister to a younger brother who went and messed up the universe. It's extremely charming and heartwarmingly 90'sMechanics:The original Captain Forever took an approach to space combat that was utterly original and dynamic. As every space-craft is centered around a fairly weak control module which, when destroyed, allows the player to remod their ship with salvage from fallen enemy ships. This means you will want to attack as much of the creamy center as possible, without doing too much damage to your enemy's hull, weapons, shields and thrusters, so that you may use these parts to become the greatest creamy center chocolate space muffin surgeon known in the solar system.In spite of the cute child-like presentation, this game is nothing short of ""Dark Souls level"" hard-core. Nothing comes easy and you'll end up fighting for every piece of salvage like it's a bread-crumb in a 1930's Polish trainstation. Trying to remod your ship while frantically dodging three, if you're lucky, incoming enemies is nerverackingly fun.The best part:The way you choose to design your ship is as dynamic as you'll find in games like Space Engineers, and doing so is a lot less dull. Every ""block (hull modules, shields, weapons, CHAINSAWS!!!!!!!!, laser beams etc) has a ""mass"" value which influences your ship's balance. Putting a truster or weapon slightly off center will spin your ship into fatal inertia, but after a bit of practise you will build the most bad mofo of swiss army space crafts fully equiped with lasers, sniper shots, missles, AND MODDERFORKING SPACE-CHAIN-SAWS!!!! It's rediculously fun!You can build big and sluggish, small and agile, small and sluggish, bulky and fast like a Coventry girl trying to get a council house. Build a lopsided flying missle♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ a triangular spinning sniper craft, or a tiny little ship that can fly its way straight the middle while dodgin torpedoes, or a fat ship that can take a million punches: it's all viable, it's all fun and you'll die anyway so why even bother.Long story short:If MineCraft scoodilypooped Asteroids (while Surgeon Simulator was ball-gagged and made to watch) you'd get a horrible game that nobody should ever play and your money would be much better spent on buying ""Captain Forever Remix"" twice. It's that good."

Controls are great and rely heavily on how you build your ship. Your ship's destructibility also has a lot to do with how you want to build your ship. For example; if you're having issues with your thursters getting shot off by enemies, learn to place them in better spots.Lots of replay value as every playthrough will be different.Lots of parts, so you can many hundreds, if not thousands, of different ships.The only qualm I have is that $16.99[Canadian dollar] is a bit steep of a price.

The combat isn't very exciting. It's just ""Shoot until the enemy's defenses target you, then move a bit to the side"" Some might think that the combat has some hidden depth in it, but I have not found such a thing.Every time an enemy approaches you, they will say something, such as ""Your ship is junk"" and ""Stop hitting yourself."" I get that it was designed to be simplistic and stupid because of how the game is two kids playing a made up game, but even then, I feel they could've tried to make the enemies a bit more interesting.When you destroy an enemy ship, they will drop their parts, BUT however much damage you did to that part during the fight, is how much damage it took when you equip it. Sometimes, all of the good parts of a ship are on the outside, so those better parts will be horribly damaged, or broken when acquired.Yes, I understand that the game is in early access, and that many things will change in the future, but for now, I have lost intrest.I AM NOT SAYING THIS IS A BAD GAME. NO. Other people might love the parts that I dislike, as they might enjoy these types of games. I think the game might have some potential, so if you disagree, please, buy the game.

Anyway I do have a ton of legitimate reasons as to why I thoroughly have not been able to enjoy this game even after 6 - 9 hours, read on if you actually care, do it for your own sake if you’re thinking of getting this.THE GAME IS WAY TOO DARN HARD FOR HOW SIMPLE IT IS!First and foremost I was shocked when I first got into the game how absurdly hard and unfair it was right from the start. I really can't express in words just how frustratingly awkwardly difficult this game is. I don't think ive ever even played a rogue lite this hard before in my life! And All I do is play games, even see my steam library. The small tutorial barely tells you how to make ships properly, what good weapon combos their might be or how things work, how important ship balancing and equal thrusters are, nope just the controls and how to put parts on other parts making the game seem soooo simple and casual, but holy frick it so isn’t. It doesn’t even explain for a second that there is a colour system for higher tiered stuff! Yea sure that's maybe a given if you know anything about game rarity systems but I wanted to express just how pathetic of a tutorial there is. Expect to go in very confused, blind and lost, cas I could never figure out fully how to not dire horribly to stupid unbalanced crap over and over even after 6 hours. It tells you nothing and throws you into hell, pitted against bigger beefed ships you have no hope of winning against without some serious fire power, which you hardly ever find in decent amounts, and expects you to get anywhere, it's just such a silly, lazy development decision to do that. I get the whole 'just jump right in and play and learn as you go! No having to mess about in a stupid lame tutorial' concept, it's an interesting one to keep using in indie games but not for every game, it's mostly only ever felt right to me in survival games like Don't Starve and even then it can be hard to justify such lack of information to the player to get in and actually be able to play properly. This kind of humiliating and frustrating experience I have had so far has all been on the darn easiest difficulty too, easy! I do not even want to fathom the BS and aggravation that would have to be endured from higher difficulty levels, I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. This game is making me feel like such an idiot that knows nothing about games every freaken run I try! it's depressing and frankly not fun in the slightest. =/ The visuals of the game make it seem so giddy, happy and casual but let me make it clear that it really, REALLY isn’t, this game will kick your archsloff and it won't care how bad it makes you feel every time it does it. Your expectations will be blown to hell after looking at this game every single time you die, and you will die alot until your either fed up and write a review, like me, smash your computer to pieces or cry in a corner, either one.The devs need to do some serious overhauling of the game balance and expectations of you fighting higher level enemies to go up a stage cas right now it's just brutal and a joke. You don't have any other way to go up a stage by the way, you have to fight and absurdly powerful ship way higher level then you with way more firepower and armour and beat it, that's fine and all, if you were evenly matched with it, but you never are and never will be, so it's like jumping into a pit of snakes and dancing around hoping not to be bitten pretty much. I could go on about how stupidly, brutally unfair and hard the game is even on easy but you should probably get the point I’m trying to make. If you don't like hard games and were thinking of buying this well then I hope you were lucky enough to read this my friend and not go through the pain I’ve put myself through to make a point that's not even worthwhile making. I shouldn’t have to ever prove myself to a darn game, it should prove itself against me! I paid for the flipping thing, if I want an easy run so I can actually make progress then why can't I?! I just feel ripped off so much right now and that even buying this time waster on sale makes me feel like a sucker. =/THE GAME IS FAR TOO SIMPLE FOR THE PRICE TAGThe entire budget clearly went into the art style and audio cas holy heck there is almost nothing to do in this game but shove pieces together hoping they work right and pew pew at other ships floating around hoping to kill them, that's it! There is almost no progression system either, you unlock new ship part kits by going up through the levels then unlock others by using new kits you unlocked to unlock the next one by getting to level x, it's actually frankly a pain in the tush cas if your new ship kit sucks and is made of parts that are almost downright useless, you are kinda stuck with them until you actually make it to the level it wants you to get to with them before you can get a better starting ship, what kind of annoying progression system is that crap?! Why not base it on kills? or how many parts you collect up? or if you make a cool big ship? nope, just boring get to this level and you get a kit. After 6 hours not only am I frustrated as hell with repeating such nonsense over and over, but I’m bored of it too and wish I had my money back to buy something enjoyable, ugh. The game may look great, has fantastic effects, voices and sound but my god the lack of gameplay absolutely kills it in every way, for me at least and alot of people without god like patience I’ll bet.Death after death you rarely learn anything new because there IS nothing to learn new, the game is too simple, it's just float around and shoot so what am I darn missing?! The game will drive you crazy with it's somehow over complicated super simplified gameplay that doesn’t ever try to help you improve or LET you improve, it will just keep killing you over and over with bull crap and give you next to nothing for your wasted time, not a single, not a bit of advice, just a kick in the nuts and a restart as a brand new hunk of junk. If you’re looking for a repetitive, shallow rogue lite game that's hardly satisfying in any way, shape or form then look no further really!CONCLUSIONI could go on about all the exact things that frustrated me non stop in this 'game' but I ran out of typing room, darnit, so this will have to be it. I’m sure I made a point to a degree cas I sure would have appreciated a warning like this before I brought this stupidly hard game. Can't possibly recommend this game due to so much frustration, it's way to shallow and unfair and demands a level of skill that has no place existing in such a simple game. The devs really need to fix the difficulty curve cas it's bonkers.3/10, stay away if you want to keep your sanity. x.x Get it super cheap on sale for no more then 5 dollars, cas that's all the fun your going to get out of it im afraid just for a quick reminder of how a video game can make you look and feel stupid."

Good luck getting past earth though, because this game is HARD, and your ship will get blown into numerous pieces until you ragequit!I think this is one of the few mostly complete early access games out there and needs more attention, especially since the originalCaptain Foreverwas really fun, but this version makes me keep wanting to come back to it.There is a bug in the game however. When exiting, the executable will stop working instead of properly close like a windows program.The game's engine happens to be Unity 3D, and that is averypowerful engine if used correctly. This is one of those cases.All of the enemies play by the same rules as you do, but be careful, you and them can shoot yourselves to bits with a single badly placed gun!EDIT: Took 7 hours to beat. Still need to unlock the final kit however, which may be another hour or two to unlock."

There are a lot of different weapons and ways to customize your ship. Really, I give this game my wholehearted reccomendation. Buy it, and you won´t regret it!"
76561198024253587,Recommended,298560,15650735,"Posted: 2 May, 2015",all,johgyl686,"A really great game, offering plenty of replayability and satisfying ship building. Both the building and fighting systems are very intuitive and complement each other nicely. The art style is also nice and colorful, fitting the theme perfectly.I have only two very minor concerns (see below). Note that the game is still in early access at the time of writing, and the changes may therefore either have been implemented at a later stage or they are made unsuitable/redundant due to other changes to the game. Whether they are addressed or not, please do not let this discourage you from buying the game, as it is already a fantastic experience.My first nitpick is with the timer limiting the available time one may spend rebuilding the ship after finishing a stage. Nowadays I pretty much exclusively use the super kit with a fully upgraded build time (210 seconds), but for the last 2-3 stages even this isn't enough to allow me to really think my design through properly (which for me is perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of the game). Also, I can't imagine ever going back to playing a kit which does not offer upgrades to build time, and are therefore limited to the original 60 seconds. While I understand the idea of adding a sense of urgency to the game even between stages, I think the enjoyment of figuring out a particularly interesting ship design outweighs it. An alternative would be to simplify replacing a module with a higher level one (without having to rebuild the entire branch of the ship connected to that module), but I think that would present a large number of difficult design choices.My second issue is with the zoom function. In the later stages there are weapon modules where the range of the weapon is longer than the distance from your ship to the top/bottom of the screen, even when zoomed all the way out. This makes it very difficult to utilize the weapons efficiently in those directions. As there are also enemies that use said modules, suddenly you may be attacked by someone from off-screen. The simple solution (from a design perspective that is, I obviously have no idea how difficult it would be to implement it in this particular game) to this would be to make it possible to zoom out further. Tweaking the range increases for late stage weapons could also work, but would probably affect the balance between different weapon classes quite a bit.As stated previously, this is a really fun experience and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a bit of creativity in their games."

If you're not aware of the original Captain Forever, it was an indie project that was great, albeit simple. This is a ""remix"" (heh) that changed the art to a wonderfully toony Saturday morning cartoon style. The music is awesome, too.As for the gameplay, it's so addicting, it's hard to explain. You get a basic starter kit, and as you kill other ships, take their parts like some sort of giant mechanical leech, and then create a newer, bigger, better (blacker?) ship.Randomly generated enemies to fight, lots of weapons, fun times to be had by all."
