Fun, easy to get into, difficult to master with an impressive flow to it and difficulty ramping up at just about the right rate through the game. The soundtrack is absolutely lovely. The mood of the game feels similar to that of the Katamari games. I wish I could think of more to say but you will just have to experience this game yourself to truly appreciate it.I would say this game is worth the price but I feel like this game was worth more than the price tag.

,Recommended,298600,13918487,"Posted: 9 January, 2015",all,Zazz The Boy,"Lovely Planet is an enigma.On the surface, the game is cute, bright, colorful, and has one of the best produced soundtracks I've ever heard, taking major influence from J-pop and various production styles like it. It looks adorable, it feels adorable, it is adorable.Then you start playing it.This game is a first person shooter that is essentially a very cute target practice sim. You need to haul it as fast as you can through various obstacles to the ending pole, shooting any and every red enemy that you see, while avoiding shooting at the blue ones. You run pretty fast, you jump very high, and you have infinite ammo in your block shooting gun. No enemies take more than one hit to kill, and only one type will shoot back at you; shooting the bullets they shoot kills them as well as stops the bullet. You have three objectives to get stars at the end of the game; beat the level (duh), beat a minimum time they give you, and have 100% accuracy on all of your shots. Sounds decently straightforward, right? That's because it is, in theory.The first world is decently easy. However, even in this world expectations are quite high; a lot of the levels I beat the minimum time by few milliseconds, just because it's so fast paced. This might just be me being bad at the game and not being fast enough, because a lot of the world records are half the average speed. However, as angry and frustrated at both yourself and the game you get, you're never genuinely mad, because of how cute and fun the world around you is. Beat a 10 second minimum level in 9.997 seconds? That sucks, but holy sh*t this soundtrack!The second world adds a new mechanic into the game; you need to shoot apples (tomatoes? large red bean bags?) before they hit the ground. Now, this would be very easy if your bullets had normal bullet physics; however, they move at a consist speed, about the same speed you run. So, if you need to shoot one of these things from a good distance as it's falling down, you need to aim your bullet down just above the ground so it'll collide into it. This is not as easy as it sounds, and I've had amazing runs destroyed because the apple hit the ground a few frames before the bullet hit. However, as all this difficulty stacks up and starts to become extremely frustrating, the amazing soundtrack just slowly washes it all away.Is this game relaxing, fun, and a good takeaway from stress and other more violent and dark games? Absolutely.Is this game frustrating, rage-inducing, and the bane of speedrunners everywhere? Absolutely."

,Recommended,298600,23849392,"Posted: 26 June, 2016",all,Rebrahimy,"Given the very quit and monotone nature of this game's trailer, coupled with another one with a more joyful background music, I went into this game thinking it would be a very calming, casual experience. Everywhere from the art design and the simpistic gameplay reflects such an assumption, if you allow the game to be a relaxing experience. It's a  fun game, but the emphasis on accuracy and time can make you choose to make ""Lovely Planet"" a very competitive journey. After a while, I decided to shoot for the fastest time and complete a stage without missing a shot, and I found such a decision to be much more enjoyable and rewarding. If you want to take it more slow and be casual with the game, this is the perfect title for such a goal. If you want to be more competitve, this also fulfills such a desire."

You'd have to be an absolute fool to neglect this purchase.Long version: My roommate suggested me this game after learning that I was looking for games to speedrun. I purchased it, fired it up, and not a moment later, fell in love with it. That kind of love you feel that just warms your whole body. My initial reaction was, ""Wow, this soundtrack is incredible! And these graphics! It's so simple, yet so capturing and quirky!""I started on 1-1. The first level in the first world. As the music changed from the Menu music to City, I got swept away in a feeling of bliss I hadn't felt in years. The controls were simple, the enemies were clear, and the objective straightforeward. Use the keyboard to move and jump, use the mouse to look and shoot. Reduce the enemy count to 0, and walk into the purple pillar. So simple! Why aren't more games like this?As you reach the goal, a new window shows up, displaying information such as how quickly you completed that level, how quickly other people completed the level (a leaderboard), as well as how quickly the fastest person completed that level. Just like that, you already have a new way to enjoy the game, as if the gameplay itself weren't enough. Now you can not only compete against your own times, but other people too? Game on.As you try to get top 15 times on the leaderboards, you start to try new things. Push the routes you used to take, or plan entirely new ones, hoping that they're faster. As you inevitably burn through all the levels in City, you move on to world 2, named Village. With each new world, new levels, obstacles, and enemies stand between you and those sweet sweet top 15 times. Can you hack it?This game is designed in a way that the player doesn't feel coddled, but at the same time, it's not impossible to win. It's designed to be challenging, but not unwinable. New enemies are revealed in open, contained areas that let you see how they function, before throwing them just around a corner in the last levels of that world.227 in game hours ago, I had the biggest, stupidest grin on my face. The joy of this game hasn't left me, even 227 hours later. If you're looking for a fun casual game, then you've found one. If you're looking for an speedrunning game that puts your skill to the test, then you've found one. Buy. This. Game. It's worth every penny.Note to potential speedrunners: This game contains little RNG. The only RNG it DOES contain, bears no effect on how the game is run, or how it affects you or enemies. The only RNG occurs when an enemy dies, or your bullet registers as a hit, your gun will be showered in stars, providing a visual cue so the player can continue without having to watch the shots connect. I can find no pattern to where the stars appear. This is the RNG. That's it. This is an extremely skill and execution based game."

It reminds me of Super Meat Boy in the sense that it encourages replaying until you ace a level, and is not as frustrating as it may seem due to the great soundtrack that continues to play through deaths, quick restarts, and the real sense of accomplishment one will get once they beat a level that has been the bane of their play. I have not finished it yet, and have only finished 2 out of 5 worlds, but I am sure I will come back again and again when I need something relaxing, yet challenging to play. Which is a good point to bring up. Lovely Planet is a very relaxing game. The cutesy pastel aesthetic is one that really sets it apart from other FPS style games and combined the soundtrack backing it, makes for an almost meditative experience. Sure, there will be some moments where you feel frustrated, but every death of mine (and there are many) has felt like it is my fault. Not the game's. All in all, I can't believe this is only 5 dollars. It is a wonderful experience. One that I feel many will enjoy. If you are easily frustrated, I would say stay away, but if you are curious, go for it. I think fans of the ""just one more try"" games will love this. I did."

The answer is that it is the most hardcore intense shooter ever created and one of the most colorful and cheerful atmospheres I have ever had the privledge to play in.So what, I could just boot up TF2 and go to some unofficial server and do the same thing but with my little pony.Well, If you are not a brony, (or are) this game is just as effervescent.Ok so what if it is cute. You said it was the ""most hardcore intense shooter ever"".In most military/hardcore shooters there is no hud (heads up display). This lack of a retical or something to guess where your bullets will go adds a unique level of challenge to this fps.Whoopdedoo theres no hud, that all you got.Well no actually, this game is timed and the goal is to get 3 stars.Stars?Yes, the stars are awarded upon three criteria. First that you completed the level (blue star). Second that you did it in a reasonable time (green star). Third that you had perfect accuracy (yellow star), which can be dificult considering that you have no retical to aim with.Ok there is nothing left to do after I finish all three stars?Wrong, if you by some arcane magic manage to finish all of the levels with three stars you can shoot for the world record on the levels.And after that?Ascend to godhood.I whole heartedly recomend this game."

My first impression of this game was that it was going to be a short game that I would enjoy for no more than a minute. I enjoy games that take time to be more artistic and unique than most games out on the market. This game is great because it shows that there are still ways to make games unique, and more games should take note. The simplistic-ness of the game fools you, because in order to beat the levels, you need to form some type of rhythm fabricated to each level. I would recommend this game to almost anyone just because of how unique it is, and I personally don't even feel this to be a first person shooter, but more of a puzzle/rhythnm game."

It's an FPS on the surface and into the core, which is not a bad thing, it's a very good thing actually. With pastel like colors, angry squares shooting at you and a lovely upbeat soundtrack composed by Calum Bowen, Lovely Planet is a great game with everything on point.What do you do in Lovely Planet? Well you shoot purple bullets towards other purple bullets, shapes with eyes that just stand in place and shapes with eyes that shoot homing bullets at you. And many more things you can shoot at (or be shot from).Most of the skill of the game comes from taking the right paths, taking them quickly while managing to avoid and shoot  ""baddies"". You can also ""ace"" (or 100%) levels by completing them under a certain time limit while not missing a shot. The game gets to a point where my brain can't handle all the things happening on screen, which makes a great practice game with a sense of triumph at the end of every level.It also has a leaderboard, my favorite thing! Where you can see how good you are compared to strangers and your steam friends. Most of my steam friend gave up on forest, so I mostly have strangers, lovely. GO PLAY IT NOW."

It’s amazing from its quick paced FPS shooting to its not obvious in your face, but certainly there story line. This game is trippy cute and simply beautiful. Yes as most people will argue that it’s just the ""basics of unity"" but it’s the simplicity that makes it what it is. Its runs perfectly with no frame drop and can run on the most potato of PC's and still play it with great performance. For me, this is one of those games that I can always come back to when bored and replay one of the many levels that it offers for time and time again fun. While not as many people take this game as serious as I probably do with what 50 hours now and growing I can't stop playing this game. Many people will also argue that it gets ""way too hard"" but that’s part of the magic. I bet anyone who actually tries to play this game from start to finish can certainly say they've more than improved on aiming skills reflexes and hand eye coordination. To me this game is yes ""changeling"" and sometimes ""rage inducing"" but it always is just that more rewarding for when do finally hit that apple you could never hit, get 100% A or beat that time limit, it’s amazing and rewarding for what it is. Another key stand point for this game is the amazing sound track. I think this game is literally meant for cheering up people with its bright colors and more than happy sound track. For the composer of it, I certainly dropped 3 bucks your way because you honestly deserve it for how much genius went into the track. This game isn't your stereotypical FPS of now a day and has its pace set to the ""get up and ♥♥♥♥ing move"" setting which makes it stand out from every other modern day FPS. It’s great for speed runners and hell casual play too. I truly and honestly recommend this to ANYONE to any time of gamer casual or NOT its a master piece and deserves more credit than it gets."

All removing the crosshair does is add guesswork to the game, which is stupid when most levels have very small frame windows in which to shoot homing projectiles. The stupidity multiplies whenever said projectiles are waiting for you in front of a teleporter exit.That being said I think most people could find enjoyment out of the first 3 worlds since their less cheesy and actually give you some freedom of how you complete the levels. The swamp (4th world) levels are filled with guess-working tiny windows of opportunity, and guessing where the falling apples(?) are going to be when your screen is entirely fog and you have no depth perception. Mountain (5th world) has even more homing missile spam in-front of you as you leave a teleporter. Not very fun or exciting, but the main point of saying all of this is that there's no freedom in how you execute these things. There's no discovery on what the most optimal route is, or how to do it.The music is alright. The visuals are alright but they feel a bit lazy. They're not bad and their artistic talent is still there,  it just looks like the developers could do better."

76561197983662248,Recommended,298600,11633344,"Posted: 10 August, 2014",all,TechieRefugee,"To start: I used to add a header to these reviews, but since it sometimes made the review too long to submit, I've opted to leave it on my Backloggery page.Gameplay: Lovely Planet is a game that can most easily be described as, ""You got Super Meat Boy in my FPS!"" The level design largely reflects on Super Meat Boy's level design ethos in that levels are pretty short, typically lasting around 15-20 seconds, but are packed with plenty of obstacles to make things challenging. These obstacles range from friendlies that you can't shoot or else you'll end the level, apple launchers in which you have to shoot the apples before they hit the ground, baddies that can shoot homing shots which you have to shoot out of the air (don't worry, it's a lot easier than it sounds), as well as plenty of other obstacles. Worlds one through three are quite a bit of fun; in fact, there was really only one level that I didn't like out of these first 62 levels.Then comes World 4. I'm just gonna be blunt; World 4 is stage memorization central. Why? First and foremost on the bad design checklist is thick fog. Seriously, designers, limiting the player's vision is not a good way to create challenge; it's just a quick path to frustrating the player. There's also plenty of points in this world where you pretty much have to take shots in the dark to be able to complete the level (See Level 4-20 which the designers had to be high to think was a good idea). Whenever you consider that a condition for completion of the game is 100% accuracy on all stages, this really becomes one hell of a frustrating experience. Second on the bad idea checklist for world 4 are shots that literally come out of nowhere. No, that's not just the fog fooling you; these shots literally come out of thin air (obscured by the fog, of course), and you can't see them when you look forward at the stage before attempting it. The only saving grace for the average player is that these stages are among the shortest in the game, but for the completionists, this can be the worst world, as some of the par times areridiculouslystrict. Worlds one through three took me 30 minutes, 50 minutes, and 60 minutes to complete respectively. World four took over three hours and even then I didn't 100% the world.  As for world five... world four has put me off too heavily for me to want to play the game anymore right now. Maybe in a couple of months.Maybe world five will be the big comeback from world four. I sure hope so. Again, worlds one through three were excellent, save for that one stage. It's just too bad about world four. 7/10.Story: Not really any here, so I'm not gonna bother going into detail about it.Graphics: The game sure does look great; at least, until world four where everything becomes terrible and fog. Man, though; world four really is an absolute blight on this game in nearly every respect (even in music, but I'll get to that later). But anyways, at least for the worlds that are actually good, the game really does look great. It's certainly a game that'll look great ten, maybe even twenty years down the line. You can't say that for a lot of games. As for the technical aspects, the game says that it runs at a solid 60FPS, and I can verify that it does indeed run at a solid 60FPS. No lag spots whatsoever. Also, thanks to the simplistic nature of the graphics, you can run this on pretty modest hardware. So yeah, the graphics side of the game was definitely not a disappointment. 5/5.Sound: Only the OST to talk about here, and - *sigh* - yes, the world four song is the weakest of the bunch. Apart from that, the OST is excellent. Calum Bowen sure did a great job with this one. The tracks are sort of like if you mixed Ape Escape's OST with any Katamari OST. Very catchy, very quirky, and just very good. As for the sound design, it uses Engine of Whimsy +10. Good stuff. 5/5.Overall scores are: 7/0/5/5; 8.5/10. Man, if it weren't for world four, gameplay would get a 9/10. Everything just went so far downhill in that world. Oh well; I'll be editing this review later on when I play world five, so maybe it'll give it a shot in the arm to bring it up to 8 or something. As for now, my advice is to play worlds one through three and then stop."

Don't get me wrong, though. I love the art style a lot and the concept is brilliant. The music is a bit on the cutesy side but never too much.However, I think it's way too buggy, especially if you accidentally jump to a wrong place and need to restart the whole level with no way to jump your way out or walk around. Since the nature of the game is to explore where to go, this might be one of the most annoying problems. The jumping needs improvement too, with some kind of actual chance to survive rather than spamming the R button.The difficulty with these things mentioned above makes the actual difficulty step between the levels even worse which is quite disturbing, in some ways it's like World of Goo which suffers from the same problems in each levels.If you can live with this, get it.

It's an addictive FPS where the objective is to shoot every baddie in the level and complete it as fast as possible all while bunny hopping across the treacherous terrain like a maniac. The levels typically can be completed in about 20 seconds and this is where the game taps into the same nerve for efficiency as Super Meat Boy, where you'll complete a level and say ""I didn't do that well enough"" and do it again. You'll be rated on both time of completion and accuracy and the game continuously brings in bombastic, insane mechanics such as apples that launch into the air and cause an instant fail if they aren't shot before reaching the ground. It's brutal in difficulty as everything is a one hit kill, but entirely fair.Counteracting the absolute insanity of flying apples and projectiles is the aesthetic. It seems indie devs are starting to move onto turning the low poly graphics of the 90s into a visual style much in the same way as 16 and 8 bit graphics have been. The closest game I can compare this to visually is the Katamari series. Everything has a quirky, colourful aesthetic to it with delightful bouncy music by Bo En. This is a world made out of origami floating inside a PS1 while you're on LSD and it's absolutely amazing. Best of all, it will run on pretty much anything.This game is extremely cheap and if you're a fan of FPS games and want something different, you'd be a fool for not picking this up."

It changes in 10% everytime.It doesn't have a sound slide bar. So you can't change the sound volume. Which is stupid.You can play with the xbox controller.About the game.You have to jump across the current level and shooting the ""baddies"". You have to kill all of the baddies in order the complete the level.  If you miss one, you are forced to redo the level again. The water balloons are an instant death when it lands on the ground.  Even if you are not close to it or near. You will still die instantly. If you hit the black cube, you will have to restart the level again. I don't think this game is worth purchasing the full price. Unless you like ""classic"" casual games.You don't have access to the options when ingame.The graphics are terrible.There is a small ingame tutorial.There is a leaderboards but who cares about those.Music is cartoony and WAY TOO HAPPY FOR MY EARS.There is no lifebar. however you do die in 1 hit.If you have hit an enemy then your weapon will glow.You have the option to look ahead. So that you know what is coming your way.There are secrets.There are many worlds and levels. i think each world has 20 levels.Other things.There are chinese language sometimes in the game. Which is not needed.This is a game for kids. That is for sure.It's stupid that they let you show the leaderboards everytime you play a level. Even if you have died and you are restarting the level again. This is really annoying after awhile.The game is also somewhat Time challenged based....How can the game be lovely if you are killing things.The difficulty wll be increased at level 2 already.-------------------I Give this game a 3/10"

Apparently the game is not at all as it seems.It starts out with some light run and gun shooting over some fluffy music and animation. But at world 2 (close to world 3) the game starts to show it's True colors. The game is hard, very hard and not in the good way. I'm no stranger to frustrating games but this One Just seems unfair.  The point of hard games is to overcome the difficulty and feel like you have achieved something. But lovely planet becomes annoying. My main reasons for this are the bombs and the lack of crosshairs.Trying not to go into to much detail, bombs are flying fruit that end the level if you don't shoot them before they touch the ground. A lot of the time the game will throw bombs at you out of nowhere and flustered you aim and shoot them. Although alot of the time you will miss. Not due to your lack of skill but because you had no idea where to aimWhat I'm trying to say is the game kills you in one hit and the difficulty because frustrating due to the lack of crosshair and One hit kill mechanics.Tl:dr if you are into hard games maybe give it a try but if you are looking for something light don't try this game"

Most of the time you will be repeating the same stage time after time again because you made stupid mistakes. The other portion of the time you will be smashing your keyboard and screaming words that you didnt even know you could say. But: Im not saying thats a bad thing because its not. It adds to playtime and it make winning a level feel very rewarding.The two most amazing aspects of this game for me are the artstyle and soundtrack. It really makes me chuckle when I realise Iv been screaming at a bunch of colourful polygons and a happy japenese tune. They both remind me alot of Japan and I think thats what they were going for considering the random japenese writing everywhere. The artstyle consists of minimilistic colourful blobs that make it easy to tell enemies and ground apart with their colours that stand out. The music in itself makes the game. The music is a nice upbeat happy track which makes you forget about all your troubles and just stand and listen. It is so happy I wonder how it could be played over the top of such an evil game! In fact I am listening to it while reading this review and it makes me not want to list a bad point about the game!The gameplay in this game is the usual. Considering that it is mainly concentrated on platforming and twitch shooting which I hate it still felt smooth and I felt as if my shots were hitting when they should. The gun felt nice although you couldnt change what gun you had which I thought would of been cool although it probably would of messed up the leaderboards for speedrunners. So I think this game could use a bit more variety to make it a bit more intresting and unique.Something this game is missing is a story which although twitch shooters dont normally have a story I think that super meat boy pulled of a pretty nice story so this could probably do it to! I felt as if that made the world I ran through feel empty and without meaning. Also I think a story would of made me want to progress a bit further into the game whereas right now Iv given up because Iv been stuck for an hour. Also It might add to the replayability.The verdictLovely planet is a rage inducing twitch shooter with platforming aspects. Its soundtrack and world makes up for the lack of story. Beware you may break something.Love+Soundtrack+Graphics+Gameplay+Long playtimeHate-No story-Rage-Variety6.5/10Thank you for reading, if you enjoyed dont forget to:Join my curator group!Visit my website!Watch me on youtube!"

The tone of the game utterly contrasts with the fact that it's a frustrating, stressful mess to play. The relentless difficulty of Hotline Miami worked because it was an integral part of the tone of the game. I almost feel ashamed to say this is difficult because it just seems like such a casual game.Buy it if you're the kind of Weeaboo obsessed with Japanese culture to the point that you don't even care about a game's quality anymore."

It's here.The concept is simple - kill all enemies, get to the end. Mastering it is another matter. Blasting your way through the levels is extremely fun and addicting. Every shot and movement means life or death inLovely Planet, yet at no point does the game seem too unforgiving or sadistic. Nailing the moves needed to pass a level feels absolutely epic, whilst trying to find shortcuts to get quicker is uttely compelling and addicting. In terms of content, there are more than enough levels to go through, with plenty of secrets and new enemies to come across along the way.The graphics and soundtrack may not be to everyones taste, but they work to make a fully engrossing experience. It makes a refreshing change from the grim, darker colours used in the majority of other shooters giving the game a rather different yet fun feeling. There was always the risk of seeming pretentious or contrived when going for a derivative art style butLovely Planetseems to nail it.Do I recommend it? Most definitely. If you like fast-paced games, shooters or platformers in general, get it now. It is hard to think of what better to buy at this price."

I've already put 5 hours into this game and barely gotten halfway through it. What's the best way to describe it? An FPS Puzzle/speedrun game? This is a game about shooting weird square enemies and other crazy looking stuff in the face with precision and speed, all the while incorporating platforming and twitch reflexes. And you do this listening to one of the greatest videogame soundtracks I've heard in years, it's very reminiscent of Katamari Damacy. In fact, the aesthetic of this game has already been compared to Katamari Damacy many times, and I totally agree with it.It's weird, it's quirky, it's challenging as hell and it will punish you for the slightest mistake if you're going for all the stars in a certain level, but you'll also just keep coming back. This is 'just one more try' in it's purest form. The game appears to have about 100 levels and has a pretty balanced learning curve; if you're a perfectionist, getting all the stars in this game is gonna take quite some time.I have to say when I saw video of someone playing this it didn't blow me away. This is DEFINITELY the type of game you have to play for yourself to see what's so great about it. It's bliss. When you finally get the perfect run, it's like entering a zen state. You'll just have to fight through many many many restarts and cursing at the game to get there. But trust me, it's worth it.One of the best indie games to come out in a long time."

The game starts off easy, and dying is quite forgiving. Every level has a maximum yield of three stars; One for beating the level, another for beating it within a time limit, and one for having 100% accuracy.As the game progresses, you will most likely find yourself redoing levels over and over and over because you missed a shot, or you weren't quick enough causing you to not get all three stars. There are basic mechanics in the beginning, and as the game progresses, there are much more complex ones. It really tries to teach you how to play the game during the whole game without too much obvious tips.Now for the bad of the game.Sadly, the game doesn't feel as if it is made with all the effort the developer could have put into it. The first thing you will find is that the game doesnt have settings to change mouse sensitivity, or even a way to rebind keys. There is also no cross hair for your gun, which can be frustrating considering you are striving for that 100% accuracy. There isn't much else to do after the game is done, making this game pretty straightforward to complete.If you are looking for a game to just try and complete without any worry of how many lives you have, or if you just want to try and challenge yourself by completing every level, this is a good game for you. It has a ton of secrets in it, and the achievements work just fine. If you don't like games that can be frustrating, or games that have no storyline whatsoever, then I would recommend looking for another game. This game has a casual feel to it, but it feels a lot like a bullet hell type of casual fps."

This game brings you difficult challenges and tests your reaction time and ability to race against time. If you wanna be the very best and test your skills in this FPS, then this is a game for you.Pros:-The price of 4,39€ makes this game totally worth it.-The art style is cute and beautiful.-The music is very cute/lovely and makes you happy.-The game is very challenging and might make you rage.-You feel satisfied after you have finished one of these almost impossible levels.Cons:-The settings isn't very advanced and the settings layout is kinda annoying. But then again, i don't think the settings needs to be very advanced, but some more settings would've been nice. I still think almost every computer here could run this game though.-There are no guidance or tutorials. You have to figure everything out yourself. You can preview the map before you start though.This game is difficult and might make you punch your screen, but if you fall for the cuteness in this game, i think you'll be fine. You don't wanna punch those cute blocky creatures you wanna save, right? That's what i thought! :3If you really want a challenge and feel satisfied after completing it, then you should buy this game.Score: 8.5/10 ""A very enjoyable game."""

However the layout is kind of weird and hard to understand and there arent any crosshairs for your gun (this is vital in the gameplay), but other than that its totally worth those 6 bucks.9/10"

To start, Lovely Planet is a game about shooting angry red guys. In order to get all 3 stars for a level, you must kill every enemy, beat the level fast enough, and not miss a single shot. With the low shot speed of your bullets, this last one can be a pain, but all of the game's enemies are stationary (except for apples, which can hardly be considered enemies) and you'll get used to the gun.The game has great visuals and music, especially if you enjoyed the katamari series. Even after hearing the same song for a few hours, you shouldn't get sick of it unless you really hate jpop.For me, the game really shines in its wonderful level design and difficulty curve. The first world is quite easy and will introduce you to the mechanics without being too punishing. As the game progresses, however, you'll find that every new level is just slightly outside of your skill level - not easy but never impossible. As someone who never plays first person shooters, I never felt that a level was too difficult to complete with all 3 stars. As far as the level design, there were multiple occasions where I saw what the level wanted me to do and got giddy with excitement, completely in love with the elegance of the design.I can't recommend this game enough. This is a game that I will always remember fondly, and I'll probably play it again in a few years when I've forgotten the specifics of the levels."

First the game is made of every j-pop fantasy the nineties could muster. Its like Keita Takashi's design seinsibility with Jumping Flash's music in a world so symbolic it can only be parody. That said it's not a vertigo introducing exploration platformer like Jumping Flash was, rather is a simplified run and gun FPS with mild platforming elements and a lot of twitch gameplay. Not as demanding as Hotline Miami, but the premise shoot, dodge, jump, react is simple enough you get straight into flow. Being in flow is a good thing. Flow is like when the Harlem Globetrotters made a 3 point shot from inside your cranuim as you eat  a hot dog. The game disurpts Japanese mascot culture with a neo-psychedlic style reminiscent of Harajku fruits. The levels are small and bite size meaning the game is neo-arcade and like Hotline requires a bit of replay. However it never tried my patience... so far. even with a slightly buggy copy cat ps2 controller and a somewhat buggy laptop trackpad however that said the trackpad doesn't register numerous LMBs in game for some reason making the firing mechanism a tad frustrating, but easily solvable. I am only 6 levels in, but its a joyful shot of adrenaline and a lot of fun to play."

Combined with the aggressively cheery (and quite good) J-pop soundtrack, it helps mitigate that the game is (at points) ridiculously difficult--I know I would probably have lost my patience with a game of this style that insisted on being grim and gritty. But, beyond that, this kind of game just flows better with minimal environments. By stripping away most potential distractions, the path and objectives (shoot all the red things, don't shoot the blue things, get to the lavender thing) become very clear.This is important, because Lovely Planet is a game that encourages you to move very quickly: if you stop moving, you will probably die. This can lead to a pretty rocky start, but as you get the hang of the game, you get better and better at whizzing through levels, bouncing around with your impossible levels of FPS air control and felling enemies with single shots. As such, the game's biggest strength is that its level design facilitates this kind of gameplay. The levels are quite hard, but they are constructed so that finding the right path through them is fun rather than a grind.One criticism I have seen leveled at the game is that the gameplay can get somewhat monotonous, but I think this is more due to the visual design than the individual levels. The environments don't change very much between worlds, which, although preserving the nicely minimal atmosphere, gets dull. Also, some of the later enemies' abilities aren't very well explained, and given that everything instantly kills, it can be kind of hard to tell what an enemy is doing the first few times it gets you. However, this doesn't weigh too much on the game compared to the one big problem:A lot of the challenge comes from tests of accurate shooting, rather than tricky platforming jumps or constant reflex tests. This is quite a sensible approach, but it would be significantly more fun if the gun had a crosshair. As it is, it doesn't, and given that the second and third worlds are largely based around skeet-shooting of a sort (enemies that kill you if they hit the ground) and enemies with homing projectiles that you have to shoot out of the air, respectively, this adds an unnecessarily irritating learning curve to aiming.Still, none of this overrules the fact that the first time I started to write this review, I thought, ""Wait, why am I writing about Lovely Planet when I could be playing Lovely Planet?"" and stopped. Once you get the hang of aiming and jumping, it's got addictive gameplay and a nice difficulty curve, set against a pleasant and cheery background. If you're strange like me and find ultrahard trial-and-error gameplay relaxing in a way, this comes recommended; otherwise, proceed with caution."

I haven't been this engaged and had this much fun with a video game in a long time.  It's very challenging while not being relentless.  As far as FPS games go, it's pretty different from anything else out there.  The goal of each level is to shoot all the enemies (and certain objects) that are strategically placed throughout the course all in one go.  There are no checkpoints.  If you die, you start the level over.  Completing the level with proficient time and gun accuracy awards you with an extra star.  The game's difficulty increases at a moderate pace and each level offers a unique challenge.  New game mechanics are thrown in at certain points along with new enemies.  You may get stuck on a level now and then but you don't feel hopeless.  You learn from each failure and feel like you are improving as a player.  The gameplay is complimented by the visuals which manage to be quirky and charming all while being extremely simple.  The music fits right along with the art style with an upbeat tempo that puts you in a good mood.Most AAA titles these days have not given me the amount of enjoyment I've gotten from this game.  And those games cost roughly 5 to 10 times more than this one!  I honestly would have spent 20 dollars for this game. It's a steal for the price.Try this game.

An FPS dedicated more towards movement than killing, the objective is to get to the end of each stage as quickly as possible while shooting all the baddies with your star gun, avoiding all the red things that could kill you and more. There's a pretty clear path through each stage yet it seems each (if not all) have easily missed shortcuts and other tricks that shave seconds off each run. Its frantic, restart-as-soon-as-you-miss mechanics works so well in reinforcing the drive to improve your time. Each group of stages introduces new mechanics gradually but in a way that challenges without becoming frustrating. Of course, these mechanics compound in the later stages becoming downright sadistic at points.I'm disappointed by the lack of leaderboards as the world record just doesn't give nearly enough motivation to improve. The movement is also a bit floaty and takes some getting used to if you're more familar with Source movement but it's consistent throughout.Totally worth the $6."

This game knows what audience it wants, and it doesnt waste time with plot. You must reach Lovely Planet. Thats it."

Plus it will run on literally any hardware, even a chromebook! (Linux chroot). If you like the speed-run game Deadcore you'll enjoy this as well. However I will agree with some other reviewers that the fourth world with the fog felt more like work, since you're mostly rapid fire shooting hordes of purple homing missiles and falling apples. The fifth world picks it up again with more dynamic gameplay, and you don't have to perfect the levels before moving on."

Don't be fooled by it's graphics, it's actually very difficult and extremely competitive amongst other players.This game is really simple with one goal, one weapon, but with various obstacles to get passed as you try to beat levels as fast as you can.I'm more of a slow pased gamer myself and although this game is extremely fast pased I'd recommend it to any player out there (especially any fast pased competitive FPS players out there). This game is also very easy to learn causing most players to pick this up in no time and also making it a great title for children.The only complaint I have is the menu system as i think it could use some improvements: I felt a bit lost in the menu when I first started the game, causing me to click a few random buttons until executed a command as it isn't exactly your common, straight forward list of options which most games provide you with as you start playing.

Kudos to the music guy Calum Bowen.The game itself... isn't all that great.The graphics need some more baking, even for a budget Katamari Damacy / Nobi Nobi tribute.There are some lazy-looking particle effects and there are great differences in the level of graphic detail during gameplay (the tiny purple stars and Japanese phrases vs. the huge featureless terrain), which gives the game a heterogeneous look (in a bad way).There are hours of content, but the level design is haphazard and at times unintuitive. I would have rather had a shorter game with levels that had more care put into them.Also, for those looking for a competitive game, I hope hacked leaderboards don't stop you from enjoying a game (at the time of writing, this game has them). Being about shooting while moving, it's also sorely missing a crosshair, which should have at least been included as an option.If you choose to play it, here's two pieces of advice:1. Turn the SFX off. The SFX consist of lazy, tacky sounds that don't do the music any justice. You lose the tell for the apples being tossed, but it's still worth the awesome (uninterrupted) music.2. If you find the shooting enemies annoying, know that you can kill them by hitting any of their bullets (bug or feature?).Overall, I still think it's a decent game, just not for $6. I'd say grab it on sale if you know what you're getting into, and even then only bother if you like the OST."

Of course, with any game like this, you have objectives and such; but there\'s also an element of exploration with the creative floaty courses (finding all sorts of secrets and oddities nets you some achievements as well as a sense of \""I explored that!\"").

,Recommended,298600,15937201,"Posted: 22 May, 2015",all,Macheti,"I didn't exactly know what to expect when I first played this game, and initially it looked like an interesting time-killer when I was bored and needed to play something different. On the surface, this game begins as a fun, cute platforming FPS in which you have to reach the finish pole while also eliminating every enemy in the level, these enemies being red blobs of various shapes. Some of these enemies shoot bullets which you can parry by shooting with your own gun. Wanting to get all the achievements, I had to get 3 stars on every level, one for finishing, one for finishing quickly, and one for 100% accuracy. This was an enjoyable challenge because it kept things tense in the first few worlds as I had to aim my shots carefully and be hasty.The last 2 worlds, Swamp and Mountains, were a whole different story however. Homing bullets were introduced, ones that you must shoot or death is basically guaranteed. Levels became misty, and homing bullets started flying out of nowhere. Bombs that are launched and must be shot before they hit the ground or you are killed instantly involve having to gauge where the bomb will be at a certain time and shooting at that spot, which is more fun than it sounds. With all these elements combined, eventually, the game turned into one of the hardest FPS/platforming experiences I've had, at least in order to get 3 stars in every level. Due to a requirement of 100% accuracy, every shot had to count, and no excess shots were allowed. After hours of memorising and practice, I would have to progress through the level, flicking and swiping to the next target, doing 90 and 180 turns constantly in order to shoot the various obstacles in my way. Despite all this difficulty, when you finally reach that finish pole with 100% accuracy, it makes you feel like some action movie star or an aim-botter of some kind :P. While torturing and rage-inducing, the rewarding experience of succeeding in this way is unmatched, and the main reason why I recommend this game, and what makes it so enjoyable.There are also a number of secrets in the game, which are fun to look for and find, especially the fabled ""Planet Shrine"" secret which is an elusive one and may require some research to be discovered.Overall, much better than it seems on the surface, and should be played and 3 starred until the end for maximum enjoyment.10/10"

What happens when you get Super Meat Boy, DOOM, CS GO, Metal Gear Solid and Katamari Damacy in a blender? This happens.The storyrevoles around you shooting up a Japanese town for no disearnable reason, while presumably taking enough LSD to make Jim Morrison blush.It's thought provoking and hits so many relatable points.It may not look like it, but the game is as tough as nails, and has a pretty steep learning curve. It's one of those games that makes you run through a level and demands the best performance from you, taunting you with your time and accuracy after each stage. There's no crosshair either, and one hit from incoming bullets (or anything that is the colour red) instantly kills you, and puts you right back at the start of the level (akin to Super Meat Boy). There are tons of levels to trawl through, with pretty much all of them looking the same, feeling the same and making you do the same things over again. Yet in the hour and a half I've played (at time of writing), it doesn't feel stale at all.Level design is actually really good, with some of the levels being fairly linear and others being open ended enough to give you multiple ways of attempting them, and allows you to experiment with the game's physics and timing. The game rewards ""high-level"" gameplay (and even demands it at some points), which is where the comparason of MGS and Super Meat Boy come from, and there's no feeling like completing a level that had you clay pidgeon shooting apples out of the sky while jumping across a pit shooting 2 projectile firing baddies and getting 100% accuracy and being 2 seconds under par. All while running backwards.A level editor with Steam Workshop support would beperfec. Or at least I haven't discovered it yet.The soundtrack and visual style is why I compared it to Katamari, if you can't tell. Needless to say it's brilliant and gives the game it's confusing theme. You're going to hear the music loop many times, and it doesn't get that irritating, or at least for me it didn't.Performance is brilliant. Constantly smooth 60+ frames from my (non gaming) laptop, with every level loading up fast, which keeps the arcade-y feel for this game at a high. You're going to need every single frame too to keep up with this game.Lovely Planet sucks you in, just when you thought this game would be something you'd purchase on a sale and forget about after playing it for a few hours.

Lovely Planet is a true teeth-gritting experience. It may be more apt to call this a puzzle-shooter than anything else, in my opinion. Lovely Planet wants perfection out of you, and it won't settle for anything less than that.The formula per level is simple: shoot all baddies and reach the big pink pole at the end of the map. Simple, right? Well it certainly starts off simple. Soon you'll move up from just shooting stationary baddies to shooting apples out of the air to shooting the baddies' projectiles out of the air to... I'm not too sure what comes after that. Haven't made it past world 3 yet cuz this game is *pretty challenging*.If you're a fan of games like Super Meat Boy, you'll enjoy this.

The basic game premise is good but is hindered by awkward graphics, sound, and music."

,Recommended,298600,29001492,Posted: 4 January,all,Vandelay,"Each level is a short segment that you're meant to play a few times before you clear it (or maybe a few dozen times in the last couple worlds) similar to super meat boy. Respawning is near instant when you die so it's not frustrating at all. It's a first person version of a precision platformer. Once you beat the game you can attempt to get 3 stars on every level, which basically makes each level a completely new challenge. There's a huge difference between simply beating a level and putting in the time and effort to optimize and perfect it.Down to personal taste but I really enjoyed the music as well.Also, if you're looking for a fast paced game to test out a 120/144hz monitor on, this game will really make the difference night and day."

You'll probably think ""what is this poo-poo doo-doo diaper baby time?"" Then you'll start to die every now and then. Nothing big, simple mistakes; but you keep dying more and more. You are spending 10 minutes on one level. Now it's 15. Now you're shutting off the game because you can't beat the level. Now you're abusing substances. Now you're homeless, but hey, that music is fantastic."

,Recommended,298600,34646135,Posted: 31 August,all,The Last Grammar-Bender,"This game... Is such a monstrosity. The jist is: you're equipped with a gun or weapon of some sort. You then shoot the red people. The onlookers, also people you can kill, look upon you with fear. You run around, shooting at red shapes. There is so much more. You're a humanoid, a stranger, coming onto their worlds and killing their people. You're a monster, a psychopath, and a inhumane being. Other than that, the soundtrack is just encouraging you to play more, kill more. I thought it best to leave while I could, before it sucked me into it's malicious desires. (This was mostly a joke, it's a good shooter, difficult, colourful, interesting. But you do go into a city and shoot objects...)"

Ever since then, I've lost interest in gaining high levels of skill, so I won't advance further.Furthermore, I recall a decreased level of enjoyment around the middle of World 3, where completing  a level felt more like a relief than a victory.However, I still have fun playing the first world over and over again. I'm not trying to shorten my older times, I'm simply just enjoying it!I highly recommend it to anyone interested in this type of game. It's not made for people like me, though I am happy with the time I spent playing it!"

This game is fast as hell, and you just keep running and making sick jumps and spamming LMB to shoot the living crap out of these weird red guys. It makes no goddamn sense, half of it is in Japanese, and it has a similar vibe to TF2's Pyrovision, but under all that is this good♥♥♥♥♥quick♥♥♥♥♥game.Check it out if you wanna get your blood pumping, highly recommended especially for the price."
