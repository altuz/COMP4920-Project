,Recommended,298630,13530715,"Posted: 22 December, 2014",all,Xhuis,"OverviewThe Escapists is a game about escaping prison. You play as one of the prisoners in a variety of different prisons. Despite its initial appearance, the game has an extreme level of depth and even the prison listed as Very Easy (Center Perks) is hard enough that I have yet to escape.Speaking of escaping, there are many methods of doing so, but almost anything you do can be traced back to you by the guards. You can steal plastic knives from the cafeteria and cut the vent open in your cell - but they'll trace it to you. You can climb onto the roof - but you'll get sniped by the guards in the towers. You can dig a tunnel towards the outer fence - but you might leave dirt lying around and the warden will have the hole caved in.You can perform favors for other prisoners to get money, which can be used to buy things from other prisoners. Favors might involve beating down another inmate or taking an item. Many items are illegal (red name) and you will be sent to solitary confinement if you are found with one or one is found in your desk during a cell search.Life in The Escapists is all about keeping the guards off of you, and to do that, you must follow prison routine. In the morning is roll call - youmustattend this or the entire prison will be put into lockdown. You also have a job that you must do. The following is the routine on the first prison, Center Perks:Morning Roll CallBreakfastFree TimeLunchWork, or Leisure if unemployedExerciseShowersEvening MealEvening Free TimeEvening Roll CallLights OutYou also have skills that can be used. Speed determines your attack speed, strength your attack damage, and intellect is your crafting smarts. You find crafting recipes through notes you can buy (or steal from others), and these stats can be raised in different ways but degrade over time.But this review is getting long, and I don't want to explaineveryaspect of this game, so let me list off some pros and cons.ProsVery in-depth; great variety of itemsLarge variety; many ways to escapeFlavorful; lots of chatting and makes the prison seem realComplete feeling; feels like a full game even in early accessConsBuggy; sometimes there are bugs, like guards shouting at you to get to work while you are at work or people you can't interact with whatsover, i.e. infirmary staff or the wardenSolitary; if something is traced to you, you go into solitary regardless of current position or state - basically instant, with no opportunity to escape itUnclear; the game only has a vague tutorial and you must learn on your own, which CAN be funLet me tell you a story.I was a prisoner at the first prison. During the first three days, I made quite a hideout. I made paper mache out of toilet paper and super glue, which I made a fake vent cover out of so I could freely climb up and down the vents without fear of leaving it open. I had a massive storage of illegal supplies, a bludgeoning weapon made out of a sock with soap inside of it, and an outfit with metal plates beneath the cloth. Most of the inmates liked me, and I constantly went around bruising people for pay/One night, I decided to explore the vents more. I left a dummy made with pillows under the covers of my bed to fool the guards into thinking I was asleep. WIth some floss, I cut through slats in the system and saw a stash on the other side of a vent which I could not bypass. I figured I could cut through the vent and go across.Wrong.I fell into the infirmary office. The door was locked, and I hadn't had the foresight to make a key from a mold. In other words, I was trapped, and the infirmary staff always lock the door when they came in. I searched all night for a way through the vent, started chipping through the walls with a screwdriver (which broke), and as the sun rose I resigned to my fate and hid in the supply closet. After morning roll call, the prison went on lockdown. As the confused inmates reported to their cells, I received a notice that the military was on their way to the prison.After a minute and a half, I was found and thrown into solitary.Final ScoreVery in-depth, great fun, and feels complete though in early access. However, it has some standing flaws and errors which interfere with gameplay.I rate The Escapists 8/10.June 6, 2015 update:I still recommend this game. There are a few DLCs which I haven't got around to playing (like the Alcatraz DLC) and it's still quite enjoyable. I'm personally burned out on it, though, and it doesn't offer much outside of the same thing over and over for its price. Wait until it's on sale and it's great value - otherwise, I would skip it."

Namely, the feeling that you get when you are almost completely sure you've set up everything right, and are about to escape, but you never know if it'll work until you try.I've left the dummy in the bed, I've knocked out my roomate, I've put the poster back over the hole in the wall, I've taken enough plastic knives to finish cutting the fence, and I didn't forget to put on my guard uniform. But did I remember fatigue? Oh no! I didn't bring any chocolate bars to make it through the night! For this, I'm stuck sawing at the fence until dawn when the snipers come back and knock me out. I'm placed in solitary for a few days. I've missed my chance."

,Recommended,298630,13154279,"Posted: 29 November, 2014",all,odatruh,"Ah, The Escapists. Such a great game. Where do I start? Let's just do the old pro's and con's.Pros:+AMAZING gameplay.""Simple"" objective (escape the prison) and there are sidequests that you can do for your fellow prisoners.+Character Deveopment.Ok, this might sound weird, but this game actually has its own way of a character development. Let's say that you do some sidequests and give away items or cash, then the prisoner(s) that you gave away items to or did sidequests for will have a better opinion on you. That's actually very important. If the prisoners rate you a good opinion (50+), then they will never attack you, give you more money for quests, and give you information when talked to. If the player recieves a bad opinion, then the prisoners that view you that way will attack you, say really useless or mean stuff to you, and give you less money for sidequests. Wait, one more thing, you can buy things from prisoners, and if they like you, then you get a discount. If not, more money. Also, there are 3 skills that your character can learn. Intellect, strength, and speed. Intellect allows you to become more smart at get higher paying jobs. Strength determines how much damage you can take before passing out, and how much damage you can deal. Speed is, well, how fast you can move. (striker311111)+Realism...kindaThis game for the most part is somewhat realistic. You're in a prison, and you have to escape. You scout around the prison and see what there is to be seen. However, time goes by really quickly (one hour in the game feels like 1 or 2 minutes). Oh yeah, and you can get money in prison. How neat is that?+Different prisonsThere are different prisons, each one being more easy or more difficult  than the others. I'm telling you, after you beat the easiest prison, you go to another one, it's gonna be really really difficult. The two problems is that the easiest prison gives a bad impression to the future ones, and that the harder ones are impossible if you DON'T use a guide. (There you go SweetJesus)Cons:-NavigationSince you're in a prison, this should be pretty obvious, but still. I have to warn you, you get so little time to move around and explore, that this game is a ton harder than it should be. You try to escape, but you see a guard in a place that you never knew about and then you get sniped and lose all of your stuff. I know it's realistic, but the player should be able to explore more of the prison.-ItemsNow, I'm only talking about hard to get items. You somehow manage to knock out a guard, and steal his key. You better escape within a short amount of time, 'cause he's gonna wake up soon and you'll get taken in again. Now, there are different keys. Each one opening a specific amount of doors. And you have no idea how to get the keys, so those items that you see in the isolated hallway is gonna be impossible to get to, and that weird room with the generator is a no-no.-TimeOne hour in this game literaly feels like a minute. I know you're not supposed to play a game for 12 hours straight, but it all feels so fast. So much you have to do in so little time, that I think it's a little stressful and intense for players who are new to this game.-The first prison (easiest)Ok, this is kind of a weird con. But I think it's appropriate that I place this here. The very first prison, the easiest one, gives a terrible impression on how future prisons will be. You do all of this work to escape, only to figure out it's really really easy. You expect the next one to be slightly harder, but no. The next prison after that is very, very hard. I still have a lot of trouble to escape it. The first prison should give the player more of a challenge. All you really gotta do is lure a guard near a door, knock him out, steal his key and go. The next prison, I didn't even know how to escape it for a long while.Overall, this is a pretty neat game. Not bad at all, only I would recommend looking up a beginners guide first to get an idea of things rather than just charging in. I rate this game a 7/10. The replay value is amazing, the concept is really nice, but there are some things that could make this game a little better.I hope this review helps."
,Recommended,298630,32301704,Posted: 9 June,all,Gigawatt,"The concept of the game is simple: escape prison.However, it later becomes a ""use the wiki"" simulator, so you will need an internet browser to complete it.Anyway, jokes aside, the game is great. Free extra prisons! Alcatraz! The A-Team!... James Bond?!PROS:*The gameplay is good, can be a little boring on an early day in-game, but the escapes make it worth the wait.*Graphics are pixels, but they are good pixels for the size.*Funny dialogue here and there. Also occasionally a guy might want you to beat him up, saying how he hates himself because of something he did, adding to that.*A lot of maps to play, plus custom ones.*Difficult but not too hard.*PRISON EDITOR! It is a little hard to use though.*You can make your own dialogue if you don't want the default.*Sequel coming soon! HYPE!CONS:*Can be difficult if you don't know what you're doing, so you will likely need the wiki,*As said, can be boring early-game.*A few bugs here and there, for instance on Camp Epsilon I always get shot while in the cell, making escape impossible.*Only 9 different characters to play as.*No multiplayer despite promised on Kickstarter.Overall this game is very great. Anyone who likes puzzle game should at least give it a shot. Or you could wait for the sequel!"

I'll say first that I've done two years behind bars in the U.S. and almost four in a community corrections facility.  This game immediately started a mild and pleasant sympathetic nervous response (i.e. fight or flight/adrenaline/epinephrine) because of the very simplified, yet somewhat accurate representation of incarcerated life, with its rigorous, paramilitary lifestyle.  I was immediately reminded of the intense cleaning rituals, endless card games, terrible smells, awful food, and the overall lack of privacy and respect from guards and other inmates.  In light of all this, my first successful escape was EXILARATING AS HELL!  This game will appeal to squares and ex-cons a like!9.5/10"

,Recommended,298630,13873244,"Posted: 6 January, 2015",all,PowerPlug,"The Escapists is a game by Mouldy Toof Studios. It puts you in one of numerous prisons with the simple goal of escaping. But it isn’t as easy as you think, the point of a prison is to keep you in your place, which is what this game does.You get the choice of one of numerous characters who you can rename, a prison, and the option to name your prisoners if you had a friend you wanted to be with during your life sentence. When it comes to content the game is incredible, there are many different items you can get hold of from soap to post cards. That’s not even all, you can combine items to make more stuff to help you escape; paper mache for fake walls, nunchucks for attacking, key molds, Dummies, glass shanks, fake grates, posters, grappling hooks and so much more!This game requires lots of planning, you can’t just beat up a guard, take his keys and leave. You need to spend some time exercising to get strong, you need key molds to keep keys or else you get time in solitary, there are guard patrols everywhere and even clogging the toilet with dirt from the hole you’ve been digging. You need to plan how you’re going to escape and balance you actual escape attempt with the prison timetable; eating, sleeping, free time, work and roll call. If you don’t fill your work’s quota then you get fired, complete the quota though and you get money to bribe other prisoners or buy stuff from them.The actual gameplay itself is really well done, everything is quite solid and the game is most definitely playable. You can choose from many ways to escape, through the vents, underground, through the front door or even starting a riot. The graphics is designed to look 8-bit, a nice look for many games that is also fairly easy to make. The audio in the game is very well made, and if you like the music playing in the background you can get the music from the game’s steam folder.If you enjoy playing games that require work and planning for you to play and succeed then this is the game for you. I rate this 10/10 in its current Early Access state, it’s a solid game worth the cost to buy it. When it leaves Early Access I don’t think there’s a rating system high enough to grade it… or at least that’s what I think will happen when it leaves Early Access anyway."

I saw it on Steam just a few days after it'd come out for Early Access (20th of August) and I thought it looked really cool. I bought it and wow... My brain just exploded with delight.If you've ever played Prison Architect, like me, you'll sorta understand how to play this game. But of course you're not building the prison this time, you're ESCAPING IT.It has a lot of cool mechanics already implemented into it. I won't give you any hints on escaping except you can use screwdrivers on vents.You can even take your clothes off...Guards beat you up for it...But there are a few bugs:I know I have a bad computer, but this is a Pixelated-Art-Style-Kind-Of-Thing game. Framerate is a bit of an issue for me.The guard AI can be a bit annoying aswell. Only a bit. Sometimes, when doing Morning Rollcalls, they'll have a lockdown because I didn't get there within five seconds. Then I have all my illegal items taken ;-;All in all, this game is worth it. DayZ has bugs, but everyone loves it. Minecraft has bugs, but it has grown to be one of the most ""Let's Play""ed games out there.

I have had so far 13 hours of gameplay and have not yet come even close to having the beggings of an escape plan.... And I'm on the very ""easy"" map. Though extreemly chalenging it is a extreemly fun and addicting game, you have to follow the daily prison routine. 1. Morning rollcall. 2. Breakfast. 3. Morning free time. 4. Work. 5. Workout. 6. Showers. 7. Lunch. 8. Evening free time. 9. Evening rollcall. 10. Lights out. While sticking to this routine you must find the time to gather recorses, Make friends, make tools, defend yourself from guards and other prisoners and put together and make your escape. You can do little jobs for your fellow inmates doing things from finding a pack of mints to shanking a guard. To escape you can climb through vents. Dig under your cell, Even mine through your cell wall with a plastic fork! All in all it is a great game. Though it is early acsess with only 3 or 4 maps trust me.... You will only have just completed the first by the time this game is completed. Best £7 I have ever spent. 10/10 game and I would honestly suggest to anyone.

You must escape the prison, and believe me, that's not easy.Now, I'm going to be honest and give my pros and cons:~Updated Review~Pros:- Lots of prisons, and cheap extra prison DLC.- Devs listen to us (community)- Amazing art style.- Challenging, you have to be smart to escape, as it isn't easy.- Lots of items and tons of item combos.- Lots of favorites for inmates.- Map editor + submission to workshop.- A semi-realistic prison feel.- Soundtrack is great! There are new songs during free periods.- Inmates speeches are pretty funny. (personal pro for me)- Multiple ways to escape. (Ex: first prison has about 3 (+) ways to escape!)- Custom inmate names, and choosable skins.Cons:- Lots of waiting, and can get very boring if you're not patient.- Cops / guards catch you easily. This makes a challenge, though!- Gets repetitive once in a while, but DLC makes up for it.-So, if you like prison games and have a lot of patience, then this is for you. My old review can be seen below, and I decided to update it as the game has updated a lot since then.Final Score: 8.5/10~Old Review~Pros:- Great art style. (32 bit?)- Soundtrack is great. Every prison has their own free time song that plays.- Challenging.- Tons of items.- Multiple, and I mean multiple escape routes. The first prison has over 3 escape routes!- Favors are really easy to do.- Inmates' speeches are pretty darn funny.- Developers actually listen to us (the community)- Each prison offers new items and layouts, and gets tougher each time.- Map Editor!- Has a realistic prison theme.Cons:- None, go buy the game!

As of now, if an NPC has contraband in their desk, and they are called for a cell search, nothing happens.

Crafting unlocks are hard to come by making the game frustrating without a wiki or tutoial.The worst offender, though, is the guard AI. They apparently hire all guards from the psychic network. Guard finds random thing in random place: blam you're caught. Guard is walking by a dark room at night and instantly notices the vent is open: blam caught. Guard goes to check your room that has a hole covered and all contraband smuggled out: he decides to look behind the poster, blam again. You've been crawling through the vents you wait until things are clear climb down: blam guard come speeding down the hallway befor you can react. And, of course if you are caught, they know instantly where everything you've set up is and undo it.I want to like this game, but it feels more like a chore than fun.

I purchased the game and quickly downloaded it (Very quickly) and began to play.I was hooked.It was something i had wanted for a while but could never find, a prison escape simulator, where all the knowledge i had mustered from watching prison movies came in handy. Shortly after starting i grabbed some plastic spoons and started digging, i hung some sheets over the cell bars to stay concealed, and within a few nights, i had been sent to solitary when the guards discovered my uncovered hole.So.I started again.After an hour of seemingly doing the same thing again and again i still wasn't bored and found new features at every turn.I love the pixelated graphics, the game gives off a light vibe but it is very hard.Also the new POW camp prison is awesome and i have put 3 hours into it already.With the constant updates and the way the devs listen to our ideas this game is definatly worth the money.I won't give it a rating yet but this game certainly has my attention."

Despite it's simplistic RPG maker looking surface it's actually a very deep gameIn The Escapists you go from prison to prison attempting to escape which unlocks the next prison in succession. There are 6 prisons in total which vary in style and increase in difficultyGameplay involves a strict schedule of showing up for rollcall (a sort of headcount to make sure no one has escaped) followed by breakfasts, work routines, exercise period, shower period, an evening meal and an evening rollcall followed by returning to your cell for lights out, with usually 2 free periods available inbetween. Later prisons have an afternoon rollcall as wellWhile going through the routine of prison life you need to devise an escape plan. Early ones are simple as there's usually only something like a locked door and a wire fence inbetween you and freedom, a couple of forged keys and a pair of wirecutters will take care of that, and most early prisons can simply be tunnelled out of if you find a good place to begin the tunnel. However the number of obstacles gradually increases with fences being electrified but linked to a generator, additional locked doors, security cameras, contraband (metal) detectors, landmines, patrol trucks, and underground electric fences or walls that cant be broken through to prevent tunnel escapes, it'll be up to you to find the weak spots in these defences. There are usually multiple solutions for each prison thoughThe game has a stat system sort of like The Sims. Intelligence unlocks crafting options, speed increases attack speed (DPS) and strength increases HP (tankiness). You can also recruit prisoners who you befriend in order to fight guards and create distractionsIn order to carry out these things there is an extensive crafting system. While you can use simple items like plastic cutlery, nail files and trowels, you will need to use crafting to acquire more effective and specialised tools, which are tied to an intelligence stat. For example you can craft together a crowbar, duct tape and a tool handle made of wood and a file to create a simple pickaxe and use it to break through walls, or do the same but with a piece of sheet metal instead of a crowbar to make a shovel for digging. Whereas you can knock out a guard or order a gang of inmates to knock him out in order to steal his uniform, you could also craft one by bleaching a prison inmate outfit and dying it with ink. Guards will react to holes in the wall but a roll of duct tape and a magazine can be used to make a pinup poster to cover the hole. If you maintain good relations with the guards they will let you hang up sheets over your cell, allowing you to dig a hole and cover it with your desk whenever you aren't working on it if you want to. Or you could remove the vent cover from your cell with a screwdriver and replace it with a paper mache replica that enables you to stash things in the vents or maneuver through the prison at nightIf a guard sees a hole, spots a hole in the wall or finds illegal contraband in your desk you'll be sent to solitary confinement for a few days, the prison will be searched thoroughly and all your stashed contraband will be found and any holes you made in the floor and walls will be filled so it's important to hide your escape plans as you progressAs if that weren't enough, the developers have produced several DLC maps, some of which must be purchases but others like the christmas inspired prisons ""santa's sweatshop"" and ""jingle cells"" are completely free and produced for us by the dev team!There is also a prison creator system and a lot of custom prisons also available to download for freeThe Escapists is not an easy game, and the path to escape isn't always clear. It takes good problem solving skills and an understanding of the game mechanics to progress or you'll never even escape the first prison. If you're looking for a challenge then you'll find it in the escapists"

,Not Recommended,298630,34203836,Posted: 12 August,all,tobiaslionheart9,"This is a game that I really wanted to like and for a while thought I liked, but it has two major flaws that make it a frustrating and not enjoying game for me.First, this game is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to play without just looking up on the internet how to escape due to the horribly broken crafting system. There are crafting notes that explain how to craft, but they are rare, there are a few dozen of them, you don't get them in any particular order, and there are a few crafting recipes that you NEED. Add all that up together and you are either going to grind through 15 hours of wandering around finding crafting notes before you can escape the first prison, or you are going to look it up on the internet. I tried to only use the crafting notes after I had found about half of them, and it was just impossible. So beware that this is a game that expects you to look up how to do everything, and then you spend the time to grind through and do it.Second, the insta-fails. Most of the time you fail when you are beaten up by a guard seeing you do something suspicious. It used to happen to me a lot but felt fair until I figured out ways around it (not a good idea to beat up guards using contraband weapons). However, very particular things will cause a note to appear on your screen telling you that you failed and you will be automatically TELEPORTED into solitary confinement. This can happen even if you are within seconds of escape with no one around you.One of the first times this happened to me, I had cut through the prison bars, used my key that I had found hidden in a wall to get to the outer edge of the prison, and was cutting through the fence, having fun escaping. Halfway through cutting through the fence, about 20 seconds away from freedom, I get a note that I failed because a guard saw my empty bed and I get teleported to solitary. So my friend tells me that I need to create a fake body to fill the bed (which I never got a crafting recipe for and only knew about because she had seen people online and guessed the recipe). So after giving up on only crafting things I knew how to, I built a fake body, cut through the bars, and on my way to freedom and I get slapped with a note on the screen saying they saw my open cell and I get teleported back to solitary.So then I thought about it. She wanted me to escape the way she had, cutting through a couple walls. But I didn't have any tools currently to cut through the walls, I didn't have the crafting recipes and really didn't want to look them up, and I didn't want to do what she did and sit there for an hour using the freebee tools that suck. So I went to expand my tunnel, thinking I could get out of my cell without cutting through the bars. Only I can't expand my tunnel enough to escape out. Sometimes rocks block my way, and other times it tells me I need to shore up the support, which is yet another thing I probably should look up and got really mad because I didn't want to just sit on Google having it tell me how to play every single aspect of the game. And as I'm sitting there, I get an insta-fail because someone completely out of my control walked by my tunnel and BOOM, instantly teleported into solitary. And that is when I realized I despise this game for being so close to a really fun experience and ending up being infuriating.Oh, and by the way, the failure system they have is extremely harsh so by the time you are ready to escape and fail 10 times in a row from insta-fails, you're going to be abusing the load system. If you actually take the consequences of failure in this game, prepare for a whole new level of boredom and grinding, thus pretty much anytime you fail, you are going to be reloading the game instead of accepting the consequences.What this game wants from you is for you to look up how to do everything on Google, grind through several hours of getting the supplies to do it, and when you are ready to try to escape, sometimes through blind luck fail and automatically be teleported into solitary where you will reload the game instead of accept its overly harsh punishments that make you nearly restart the entire game. Does that sound like a fun time?"

,Not Recommended,298630,29643203,Posted: 1 February,all,Johnny Big-Pants,"This game hits so many marks, but drops the ball in big ways that make it ultimately unfun and punishing in unfulling ways. This game has an awesome concept and has a ton of freedom in actually pulling off your daring escape,  but the problem comes from it's very unfair, unforgiving difficulty and grind-heavy RNG loot system. I don't regret getting it, but at the price their asking, this game just isn't worth it. In fact, it's only worth it for those who are curious about what a good prison escape game could look like, since there really isn't anything else like it.The biggest bone to pick is the difficulty. If a guard walks in on your doing anything uncouth, you're caught, your tools of escape are taken and thrown into the void and you're basically left to start from scratch with just about all progress lost. Now this wouldn't actually be a huge problem if the guards played by the rules. There's a lack of a more refined in-game logic. Every punishment is sweeping and is basically a soft ""Game Over,"" leaving you with 90% of you progress lost. WHERE you get caught or what you did to get caught do not factor into what the guards take from you. If you've been stashing goods in the vents for the past hour and you get busted digging a hole, everything you have in the vents is taken, even though you were caught underground. Anecdotally, I had stashed a ton of escape tools in the vents and decided to beat up a guard and see if I could steal his key. I pulled it off, but you have exactly 20-30 seconds before you receive a note saying they know you took the key and you're busted -- a.k.a. soft ""Game Over."" I can accept getting busted for taking a key after pummelling a guard. The problem is, after taking the key, I ran and stashed it in another inmate's desk along with my other tools, knowing full well I'd be busted in mere moments. The message popped, I went to solitary confinement for three days, then was loosed to get back to my master plan. I ran back to the inmate's desk to find that the key was missing, but my other illegal tools were still there. Furthermore, I went to check the vents and for whatever reason, they had taken everything out of them and replaced the fake vent cover I placed. The checked the vents because I stole a key? And they magically found the key, but didn't take the other tools I placed in the other inmate's desk? Doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and that's one of the big places the game fails: it just throws a blanket punishment instead of one that makes sense for the situation.The other major problem is RNG. You'll need specific items for every escape method you can conceive; not just one, but several of them to craft and for each individual step of your escape. But the game is so incredibly stingy about giving you any items you need that your best bet is to plot several different escape methods at the same time, just using tools and items as they pop up. This kind of detracts from the idea of planning your escape, since you're never really given any sort of choice or method to obtain key items necessary for escape, and with an incredibly limited inventory space, no place to truly protect your items, and a guarantee of losing near everything you've accumulated if you get busted for any single misdeed, it can take an hour just to prepare a single escape attempt, not even properly execute it.It's such a shame, because the freedom the game allows for is like something out of the early days of PC games, but this freedom means very little when you are bound to RNG for all of your tools and you can lose all of those tools in a literal second of wrongdoing -- an hour of work gone in a second. I would expect a game like this to be harsh but fair. Instead, we have a game that's just harsh and becomes a tedious grind after a few hours of play."

Well, hopefully nobody finds contraband in your desk now, because if they do it's a one-way-ticket to solitary without you being able to do anything against that. You get a message and bam. Try again. Stole a key from a guard? Oh yeah. As soon as they wake up they know it was you and they also instantly know where you are. To the solitary!I also just dug a tunnel. Over 50 tiles. Took me more than 3 ingame weeks and required♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of duct tape. My only problem was the electrical fence. So I dug to the generator room. counted tiles. I wait for the night, want to dig up to shut down the generator. But nope: As soon as my hole is open I get a message that a tower guard spotted it and that I have to go to solitary. Yeah. Thanks. Do they have X-Ray vision and are able to look into ♥♥♥♥ing buildings?Stuff like this really ruins the game, as it really restricts you in what you can do and it doesn't even make any sense the way they did that. Why not let the guards order a shakedown when they notice a key is missing? Search every cell and prisoner. This would at least give you some time to maybe frame another prisoner for stealing it or give you the last few seconds you need to escape. And it would be more realistic and less annoying. The way it is it feels more like an adventure with the solution predetermined by the developers. If I want to dig a 100 tile tunnel to escape you should at least honor that I did that instead of throwing me into solitary with a ♥♥♥♥ing message."

But overall it is tense and so far i havn't figured out a way to escape and you can in see my time above (i will edit when i have beat and at what time) i havn't been able to leave the easiest prison which is the only one but i expect will add more as they have said so in the description. so far this game is exactly what i have expected of it and so far ive loved every second! edit: they have now added a 4th job within the first couple of weeks which i hope is a sign of the devs reliability to continue the escapists so i can enjoy this game further.edit: More prisons have been added aswell as a tab for custom prisons (steam workshop lets hope) meaning the replayability has just sky rocketed. *Tiny spoilers* Some things seem to be a bit harsh for example i filed a vent out in someone elses cell and it was unnoticed for 3 days then radomly it was noticed, linked to me i was in solitary and all contraband was taken away, i also dislike how you are instantly caught if you are in a vent or underground so there is no way avoid it (i would like to think this is just because certain elements havn't yet been added like guards underground or in vents). still believe it's worth the money and a written tutorial (instructions) have been added and i still havn't escaped. (i probably suck). Hope this helped.edit 2: This game has some real issues and if i could id change my review to a side thumb. I mean its repetitive but im ok with that, the things that annoy me are the little things and they have made me uninstall the game. For example my biggest pet peeve is that a stolen key will always lock you up, let me give you an example, i recruited 3 guys and told them to beat a guard up around the corner i went around the corner and picked up the key and placed it in somebody elses cell, guard wakes up i get sent to solitary. I mean i could understand a shakedown but no instant arrest. another issue is that other people cant seem to get sent to solitary, beating up guards? no, contraband in cell during shakedown? no, nothing. I enjoy escape mode more in prison architect and am seriously dissapointed with this but i will keep it as recommended for 2 reasons, the devs support is great and that should be rewarded, i think these things are only gonna be only slight issues for others whilst for me there so frustrating i dont wanna play this and the idea of the game is enjoyable."

76561198257990575,Recommended,298630,33728366,Posted: 22 July,all,JewPowersActivate,"TLDR: Worth a purchase and a fun idea with good gameplay, though some of the core mechanics are a bit rough around the edges.The Escapists is, put simply, a very good game. It's an interesting idea carried out with smart execution. The prisons have various ways to escape and a large variety of craftable items to help you do so. You can escape levels through vents, underground, getting ID papers, destroying outer walls and fences, or tying up the guards and initiating a prison takeover. The mechanics that comprise this game are generally good. The idea of guard heat is realistic and adds challenge to the game. Things like the inmates having opinions of you, gaining intellect for crafting, training for extra strength and speed, having a prison routine, a job, doing favours for others, are some of the basic features of the game, and are generally well thought out and designed.I say generally because the main problem I have with this game is the luck aspect. Most of the items you attain are found in inmates' desks and sold by inmates. Granted, some are found around the prison or through jobs, but the resources you find in the former two ways are necessary to escape the game in all scenarios. Files, duct tape, toothpaste, lighters, these are all found through inmates. However what the inmates have and sell is entirely down to luck. So your progress is hindered for a day if you're unlucky. These leads to these slow, tedious days where there's no loot that can help you progress, so you're either grinding stats by just tapping Q and E, or you're doing work. And you can't skip days, so you're doing that for fifteen minutes (8:00-23:00 ingame).Moreover, in this game you do work. It isn't mandatory, but it's the only way to gain a stable income.(You can gain money by doing favours for prisoners. However, these are things like retrieiving items or beating up guards/inmates. If you do the latter, you will get instantly shot by a sniping tower guard if you're outside (and quite a few of the prisons are largely outdoor-based) or guards will swarm over you. And with the former, the items you get are up to chance, so it isn't really stable.)This is a basic game mechanic, but it's literally work. Every job is pointing and clicking. The jobs include sweeping stains, moving metal plates to machines, and crafting things. This is core to the game; by doing this you gain money and access to basic resources. But working isn't fun. I play The Escapists to unwind from working. The game is trying to make me enjoy myself more by giving my access to money and resources, but in order to do this, I have to sacrifice enjoyment.You need to access work rooms to gain resources. Of course, to access rooms you can mine through the wall or get a key, but it's hard to find the resources to do this when a lot of the resources you need are in the room you're trying to access, and plastic keys break after a while and mass transporting contraband isn't efficient.These are basic features of the game, so not only are you constantly burdened by their flaws, but they can't be easily changed. However, I'm sure the developers, who had the fundamnetal understanding of enjoyable gameplay to make this game, could come up with a solution. How about if an inmate has a high opinion of you, he can tell other inmates that you're looking for a specific object so that they're more likely to sell it. Perhaps add a pickpocket mechanic to steal items off guards.Even though it's flawed, this is still definitely worth a purchase. There are a lot of prisons to entertain yourself with, and gradually working on a way to escape is fun to plan and do. The soundtrack is good, nothing particularly amazing, but some nice background music, and some of the prisoner comments are amusing. Easy to run and I'd say worth it."

I bought it after the ""Full Release"" though, so why do I feel screwed? Because this game does not feel like it should have been moved to ""Full Release"" yet.Don't get me wrong. I love the idea of it and the degree of freedom it gives in terms of strategies you can come up with. I love the 8-bit semi-goofy guards, inmates, and general prison life. I love the interactions with your peers in crime and the routines of the day that you can end up using to your advantage. I love what they've done with it so far -- and while that is something okay to say about an early access game, it is not okay to say about a Full Release.You see, none of those things feel fully fleshed out. Sure the NPCs have funny dialogue, but by 2-3 in-game days of play, you've heard it all. Oh, someone ate all the cream custards again? Or stole the warden's toupee? Shouldn't he have that glued on by now? And the amount of times your hear about an inmate's wife leaving them or dying is just not possible in a monogamistic society.You can do favors for your fellow inmates but these are a selection of 3 different types of ""Quests"" with random targets: you're either going to find them an item, distract the guards at a specific time, or beat up someone they don't like. They get pretty repetitive shortly, and sometimes they play out ridiculously -- you beat someone up, notice they have a quest item on them for a quest that they gave you, take it from them, and then give it back to them to complete the quest. Some people think that's quirky and funny but to me it's an incomplete system. Why can I give someone their own pillow and complete a quest for them? And it would be cool to see other quest types, too, like an inmate asking you to plant evidence in another inmate's cell, or have them invite you to their escape attempts or vice-versa.One of the biggest things that seems unfinished are the so-called ""Instabusts"". When you break a vent, dig a hole, steal a guard's key or do anything else ""escapy"", even when no guard is in sight or would otherwise know, you are almost intantly discovered unless you do something to cover it up. It makes sense to make a fake vent cover so a guard strolling by later won't notice anything suspicious, but they notice RIGHT AWAY, relying only on their psychic guard powers. They know it was you whether you're breaking a vent in the bathroom or have dug a hole in another inmate's cell, too. Sneakiness is out the window. Plus, the second that they detect you, you're thrown into solitary. They don't start sweeping the cells or climbing into the vents, you're just caught. With a note from the Warden saying ""Nice Try"", of course.I can practically hear a meeting between the developers where one of them said, ""And then we'll have the guards start a search or line up everybody for inspection,"" but they just never implemented it. It's a game mechanic where something more should happen but doesn't, and it feels incomplete.When you put all these things together, you realize that the game's promise of ""Think up your Own Escape Plan"" doesn't really let you do all the strategies you may come up with. Want to conspire with other inmates to set up distractions or get supplies for you? Can't. Want to go to a seldom-patrolled part of the prison and climb into the vents? The guards will know anyway. Can you even make a key out of soap, one of the most used prison-break tropes? Nope.Even as I write this, I worry I'm being too hard on this game. It's not like any of these things make it unplayable or broken. It just doesn't feel like a Full Release. In the time I played I kept thinking of mechanics and details that it would be cool for the dev team to add, but it's not in Early Access anymore. The game is even fun to play for a while, and this review is sooooo close to a Recommended. But, in the end, the game doesn't seem to have enough polish to make that fun varied or lasting. They should have finished it first."

The concept is super cool, and the fact that it's basically a puzzle game is very interesting, but the gameplay itself doesn't have any soul.  It too often feels like work.  Very little of what you have to do is intuitive, specifically the crafting and how you are meant to interact with the environment.  Items have no descriptions to indicate their potential functions.  Characters are just pawns to manipulate, you can't really interact with them in a meaningful way to glean info on how the game works, what might be going on in your prison, or what you might be able to do with them (on top of them being personally indistinguishable from one another).I too often just had to look something up to see if I could do it, and if I could, how, because it was rarely obvious.  For example, I knocked out a guard and immediately tried what I knocked him out for: making a mold of his key using my soap bar.  Nope.  Or how about making the key using the correct mold - molten plastic?  Got a lighter and a plastic fork and - nope.  Plastic has to come from a comb or toothbrush, I discovered when I looked it up.  Alternatively, I could pay my character's money to use the payphone to get randomized hints about what to do, but why can't I just glean this info from playing the game? It is otherwise simply not there.The stats for your character also feel like artificial blockades, and why they degrade I'm not really sure.  I don't want to spend 3 minutes clicking one spot in order to get smarter, or pressing the Q and E keys over and over to get stronger or faster.  It's just not fun, so why have it?  The worst part is you don't level these stats up in any other way besides the exercise task or the reading task, so you are forced to engage in these activities.  Increasing these stats based on what quests you complete would have been a good idea, or based on moving around the prison, but it doesn't work that way - you must exercise or read, which amounts to wasting time both in-game and in real life.  Nothing quantified how I feel about this game better than clicking the bookshelf and watching the ""reading"" meter fill up over the course of a couple seconds.When the game works, it works very well. Attempting an escape is thrilling and got my pulse going. It's just the process of getting there that is not fun. I don't want to have to have a browser window open when I can't figure out why I can't combine a pillow and a prison outfit to make a bed dummy, or why the entrance key won't let me out of the prison, and for that matter what these colored locks mean and why I have to actually obtain the keys to them before I can even see their names.This game feels like it was designed by people who are very comfortable with having a browser window open in crafting and survival games, as though that's just the accepted reality of these games.  That's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reality, man."

However whenever i go back to play this game, i just find it very repetitive and boring as i'm just doing the same things every in game day with no real gameplay changes. The game can also get really boring as sometimes you have to wait around for certain things to happen and this unfortunately ruins the game for me.Perhaps im not really into simulation games and i may return to this game someday, but to me, this feels like the type of game that you could just watch someone else play to completion and still feel satisfied. I cannot recommend this game because of these reasons, however if you are into simulation style games, then this game could be for you. The only thing i recommend is that you don't play this game for to long each day as this is the main cause for the game to get boring and repetitive.Overall 5/10 - Good game but very slow to progress.

A lot of it boils down to just tediously repeating the same routine until RNG turns up the items you need to craft another item you need to work on your chosen escape method (there are multiple approaches, but it's the same materials-collecting game either way).There are other games where you do the same routine over and over again, such as in games like Stardew Valley. But I think the difference is that in a game like Stardew, you are doing those routines because you have CHOSEN to. You're free to break the routine and do something else (or nothing at all) at any time. But in The Escapists you MUST do the routine OR ELSE.And I'm not saying that the repetition doesn't make sense, because given the game's subject, it makes perfect sense.But as a game, I just got tired of the repetition very quickly. Indeed, too quickly."

Attempting to escape from a desolate jail, in desperate need of a quick bail. The gameplay is simple; you need to breakout no matter how many guards/prisoners you’re required to takeout.I admire the options, no matter how dire like hanging from a wire. You can dig out, but if the prison is big it won't end well with me and my mate dizon arisen from the dirt, only to appear in the middle of the yard in fear and sniper fire.You can cause a riot when things've gotten quiet, but certainly hard when I kept losing my teeth in the yard.Or more fun escape via roof, while under pursuit before getting stomped by the guard’s practical hoof.All in all I can't comment much more beyond that, the involvement of this game is like a torrent of vomit, a spice rack of chunks of what was a good snack, but with an oversized wallet locked away in the closet it becomes quite worth it.Otherwise can recommend."

The necessity to follow your routine to maintain your cover is great, and really adds to the drama of trying to escape. Hiding your tools, using fake walls, looting other prisoners when they get beat up - it's dog eat dog, and I love it.The art style was a good choice, in my opinion. It's pixel art, which works great for this setting. Even with the limited tile size, the game manages to look good, I've never wondered ""What is that supposed to be?""The music is very catchy, though the only drawback I have is the transition between 'periods' feels disjointed. Going from, say, free time to lunch, for example, it's very noticeable that it's loading a new background song, as the first one just ends, and the other begins.The gameplay is good. The controls are very tight, and the UI is intuitive. The cursor does a good job of telling you what it's currently doing, in terms of combat, using items, or interaction.Difficulty wise, it's got a bit of a learning curve. But once you kind of learn your routine, you can start picking your times to work on your escape. It's challenging to find the right tools, or enough tools, so you do tend to have to stockpile before you can really get to work.Overall, I'd give this game a 8/10."

The learning curve is of an acquired taste, and there's a lot of trial and soul-and-progress-shattering error but it's well worth it and is a better experience for it.Sometimes you'll fail a lot just trying to work out the rules of the game and I can see how some would find that frustrating. But I still generally respect the decision to lean the design in this direction.If you find yourself tempted to look up crafting recipes via Wiki's etc I would advise you to try not doing so, and simply allow yourself to be immersed in this fun little prison life sim and start putting ideas together just as I suppose you really would if you we're planning some kind of daring escape! Try things out and experiment, the recipes and working ideas i've discovered just by putting two and two together were incredibly rewarding, infact so were the recipes that you get out of finding and acquiring ""crafting notes"".There's an immense sense of satisfaction in finally making your first escape after 28+ days of learning the game inside of the first prison. It feels very real and rewarding and triumphant in a way not many games can offer. Because of how open the game is, the plan you make is your plan and will in some way be probably quite different to everyone elses plan. I got very invested in my first escape when I finally committed to ""making a break for it"".It's also jusssst accessible and forgiving enough, with _just_ stupid enough AI to make the player feel reasonably comfortable with experimenting and trying out crazy ideas. A very difficult balance to get right.Awesome game."

But as i played further, the game really lost its charm and became really boring. There are really no fun ways of escaping, and for the most part, escaping is impossible unless you google how to do it. If there was a way to organize an escape with other inmates, this game would be leaps and bounds greater. But of course the other inmates are pretty useless for anything other than items. You always see the same few jokes that have lost their novelty 1 or 2 hours into the game, and talking to them only gets your respect up. That respect doesn't translate into them helping you in fights or building a gang; it only makes their comments change to a happier tone. They don't give you tips on how to escape, you cant task them to do your dirty work... The disconnect between NPC and the player is so frustratingly low. I hate the fact that the game feels less like a prison and more like an endless challenge with no real satisfaction.TL;DR - the game is a great concept, but it lacks complexity that would make you really immerse with the world. The disconnect between player and NPC is so large, it is actually frustrating. Its not worth your money, honestly.3/10PS: I bought this game back when it was Early Access, but i have played the full release version. My opinion still stands."

Once you have opened the game you get the usual intro of about 3 logos or so, real fast, then you're on to the main menu. Start a new file, pick a prisoner, name that prisoner (optional, default names are provided), then, just like a snap of the fingers, you're in prison for whatever reason. You have one main goal: escape. You have many ways to escape the prison/camp, but each prison/camp varies in difficulty. You can tunnel out most prisons, cut through them, and. if so you wish, take some nunchaku (NunChucks), knock out every guard and just walk out the place.There is more to the game than meets the eye. Under the nostalgic 16-bit graphics, you have a complicated, yet easily understandable game. There are very many crafting recipes, and yes, I know what you are thinking, ""Oh no, another clone trying to rip off the ol' MineCraft crafting mechanic..."" But that is not how the crafting works. Sure, you collect items to make something new, but you're not making furnaces or desks, or even beds. You are making your means of escape. After you have made your contraband through the detectors, to your room, or wherever, and make your items, you have to hide them. Cell shakedowns are very common and happen on parameters I'm not sure on yet. Once you have everything you need, its time to move. You have to have impeccable timing skills to escape properly without detection. It took me forever to escape my first prison and that happened only a few days ago. I tried doing it the difficult way, and that only messes you up further.There are relationships between the prisoners (friendship wise), and you need some of them to like you, too. Especially your roommate if you have one.Let's talk graphics. They're simple, yet elegant, and you can tell what the group of pixels are supposed to be. That is how you do 16-Bit graphics, my PC Master Racers.I whole-heartedly recommend this game. Now, on to the original review!""I vote this game 10/10.

,Recommended,298630,14451281,"Posted: 13 February, 2015",all,zinnia,"this is a hardcore strategy game with a limit of options avalible to you. the amount of options you have depends on which prision you are currently trying to escape from.  Tougher the security is in the prison, less options you'll have. The world is comedic, but you hardly see anything comedic, you only read them through text bubbles. The learning curve is abit steep, but the community has your back there, just check out the Guides in the Guide section on steam for any information you need.  the Ui design is abit "" right in your face "" and way too large. Everything you have can be taken from you upon death but you can also lose items if you have them. But that depends on if it's "" contraband "" or not. The maps sizes vary, but most of the maps have a huge ground to cover. The graphics help hide the real brutality which occurs alot in this game, like seeing 3 prisioners fight one another with 5 gaurds jumping into the brawl with nothing but batons. The ""death"" mechanic is treated more like ""knocked out"" in the game. But, getting shot by a sniper from a gaurd tower....kinda ruins the supension of disbelief even though the game wants you to think your just knocked out.Annd...well, that's it. That's all I can say on this.The game itself isn't much really. But, it's sure entertaining when you have a need to do a ""escape"" of sort.Ohh, and my creditials are as follows:I cleared the tutorial, Center Perks, and Stalag Flucht during early access."

When you try to escape, you need to make sure every guard is gone. If you want to dig your way out, you need to have a tunnel short-term. Not having and underground tunnel long-term, because everything will be gone, even your other stuff you used to escape.- Crafting is very hard, your need to find crafting recepies and you need to higher your intellect or you can't craft stuff.- Your stats increase slowely, keeping your stats at the right place is hard and requires valuable time you need to have to escape.- Guards will dislike everything you do (Not being on the right place on the right time, standing on table's, looting stuff etc.)Let's dump all the negativity and move on with the pro's:+ Very well scripted, you have different periods (You need to finish your job, have meal, train, etc.)+ This game has humour+ Very addicting (Because you fail everytime, you want to try again :P).+ Community is ok. Some immature people, some nice people.+ Missions and different ways to earn money.+ Every thing you make or do, feels rewarding.+ A lot of items.+ Workshop, all these maps are amazing.Overall: 7/10, not for everyone. If you don't like 2D games I suggest to you that you won't like this game. The con's are the reason this rating has -3 points. The game is very hard, even in the most Easy prison available."

76561197966468803,Recommended,298630,29628726,Posted: 1 February,all,Momentum,"Ok... So we've got a small game with limited budget and somebody on the developer's side who's smart enough not to care. I've watched games like this crash and burn in the past, but lookie lookie, with simple objebtives, and Mod-Editor, and a ton of imagination and suddenly you got something that smells like the beginnings of a Franchise!PROS and CONS: Ok so it's simple. It's works simply. It looks simple. It feels simple. It's not, drop you jaw, beautiful, nor should it be... That would be an entirely different game, if it was. (and most likely rubbish to boot.) It IS simple but it works (and primarily because it IS just that, simple.) It's funny, frustrating, difficult to learn, and good ol' fashioned, arcade style annoyingly difficult to keep up with if you don't plan ahead for eventualities. There's tons and tons of content and there will likely be tons more, at least until somebody funds the Team for a sequel or remake (God help us, it'll be a hard hurdle to clear to make something ""better"" or whatever, than this nice, annoying, addictive, timeconsuming, SIMPLE little game...) The controls are a little pedestrian and a little bit of a pain to master properly, but it actually feels like that was done on purpose to give you that old arcade feeling... The physics are a bit weird, but they work, (and, no, we'll not get into the ""recipes"" or ""blueprints"" or ""plans"" for assorted stuff you can make to aid in your escape, it's a little harsh, and probably a far cry from reality, but, also probably, not far enough...)Overall: For a ""cheap"" little game, with rudimentary graphics, gameplay and little-to-no story, this is a slam-dunk. I won't be playing this constantly (not anymore. It's so damned addictive you forget the time, once you commit to escaping,) but I am sure not gonna be judging anybody who does. And I probably will be checking in once in a while to check the content, and check to see what else the dev's have planned. - There's promise here, and fingerprints of somebody who likes to play as much as they like to make games.For what I think the dev's were aiming for: I'll put it down hard 10/10. You nailed it!On a more general basis of my own preferences: 7,5/10. It doesn't blow my mind, (not that I think it was supposed to,) but DAMN is it fun. It won't be on my top ten for ""Greatest Games,"" by any stretch of the imagination, but it will sure as hell be one of the games I WILL come back and play again, and again, and again, and again...."
,Recommended,298630,15134871,"Posted: 30 March, 2015",all,Apollo,"The Escapists is a puzzle and sandbox game which tasks you with escaping several different prisons (each getting harder than the last).I personally found this game to be very enjoyable, the game gives you plenty of ways to escape from a prison, giving the game a strong sandbox feel and high replay value. Don't expect to get out of prison on your first run fast though (unless you look at some guides), it takes a long time to find the right moment to take action, but you are rewarded with a strong sense of accomplishment once you leave the stone fortress behind.Gameplay:The Escapists has a rich and deep system of ways to escape and content within the game. As stated earlier, there is plenty of different ways to escape from a prison. I like the way they incorporated your character's stats; you have to regularly train your character's ablities (going to the exercise room, reading, etc.) to improve your capabilites and keep your stats up high. It prevents simply maxing out all your stats and leaving the prison easily. The crafting system is complex and interesting, but I find it rather annoying that you have to buy the crafting notes from inmates (when one could simply use the wiki). Combat is rather boring, as it's simply a question of who is stronger/has a better weapon. This is easily forgiven though as combat is not the aim of the game.Graphics:The graphics is a simple yet charming 2D art style. You can really see the amount of detail that went into the art.Technical:Much to my delight, I have had absolutely zero technical issues (framerate, crashing, etc) with the game so far.Music:Simple and rather bland. Most of the time it just acts as an ambience. While it's not terrible, don't expect an amazing soundtrack.Final Score:The Escapists is a rich and rewarding game that is defiantly worth your time, although it may be a bit pricey for an early access game, it defiantly already is at a stage of completion with a few small issues and improvements that could be made.EDIT: I am very happen to see the release of the prison editor and (extremely cheap) DLC for the game. Boosts my overall score to 8.8.8.8/10"

THEY'RE STILL UPDATING THE MECHANICS AND STILL GIVING OUT BIG MONTHLY UPDATES FOR BOTH THE MAIN GAME AND ESCAPE MODE! (EDIT: Escape mode doesn't seem to get any better. Buy it anyways for the awesome prison mechanics)The game was sadly very promising before final release.They had so many plans and promises. (I'LL SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST)What we got, was predictable AI with telltale signs of where they're going with numerous glitches.Most gamebreaking being guards switch which way they're heading when you enter and exit inventory or other menues and prisoners getting stuck in walls indefinetly. These glitches were precent in early versions of the game and has yet to be fixed.No in-depth relation with prisoners.They are basically a chest that needs money to give you things to dig out of prison.Escaping is not fun or original.You do always have a shining sign with the message ""EXIT HERE."" You either dig your way under a wall, dig trough a wall with a fork or try to beat up guards with hot chocolate.If you get caught THE ENTIRE MAP JUST RESETS! All your hidden stowaways are magically found, broken walls fixed and holes filled by the guards because they found dirt in someone elses toilet and ""tracked"" it back to you.Did I mention the glitches that will never be fixed?I mentioned AI already in the ""Predictable AI"".Your inventory lags in some weird way making you have to wait about 1.5 seconds between clicking anything when you try to spamclick 3 times per second.If you get shot by snipers the star effect sometimes sticks, even when you save and exit.Some toilets make guards glitch when they try to unplug them. They're supposed to make that 8-bit alert sound once to signify that they have found something out of the ordinary. They're then supposed to check the contents of the toilet to make sure that no contraband is found in it and then just unplug the toilet and walk away. Instead they keep making that annoying alert noice every 2 seconds and just stand there until you quit.Dirty spots and weeds stack on eachother and only count as one when you work as a janitor or gardener making you work extra, a thing you dont have time with.The maps are plain and the ""snipertowers"" are sprites of guards surrounded by a 3x3 wall.And the absolute worst thing about this game, is that they have the guts to dare to shove lackluster DLC for this UNFINISHED game down our throuts. 5 are out already ranging between 1€-2€ with more probably incoming. These are just single maps. I would be ok with this in some degree if it wasn't for the CONSTANT reminder to ""BUY THE DLC!!!1!!""I checked the game today before making my final verdict of the game and the first thing I see is a pop-up menu with all the DLC that i should buy. When I clicked out of it and clicked ""New Game"" i got a little red notification AGAIN to buy he DLC.Some special items are only usable in the DLC maps but they still show up in a normal DLC free save. Their paywall is even thcker than anything I've seen come out of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of EA. Atleast their DLC mappacks containg multiple maps that are goodlooking instead of this piece of crap.I wouldn't be angry if they were honest about their plans for DLC, because I wouldn't have touched it.TL'DR: THis game is lacking in content, is glitchy, mechanics are not even scratching the surface for an ""escape from jail"" game and the devs are shoving crappy DLCs down our throuts. Buy ""Prison Architect"" instead!"

You are able to chose from a variety of characters at the beginning to start off your quest to freedom. The aim of the game is to escape (incase you hadn't figured it out) and there are many ways to do this. There are no hints and tips in-game to get you out. you just need to use your initiative. You can go great escape, or steal the keys and hope you can out run the bullets. To do some of these tasks you need to buy equipment from the other inmates. This obviously requires money, which you earn by doing favours. While there are only a few different types of favours in the game at this time, they always seem rewarding, whether that be money or because you punched someone in the face during showers and outran the guards, i dont know. What i do know is the monotonous of buffing up is very.. well monotonus.

Even though discovering things may take some time and you might be sent to solitary quite a few times, you start to understand what really matters and eventually you start to chip out ideas and plots of how you're going to escape.

It makes you pick a character and gives you an insight in to prison life, as well as trying to escape the prison.

The routines vary from prison to prison as well as the level of security so that not everything is a doppleganger of one another.2. I find this game oddly addictive unlike some other games I have come across. I always try to escap with no avail yet I am always trying and trying again showing no signs of boredom whatsoever.3. This game is in very early stages.

If you're thinking ""I like Prison Architect, I think I'll like this"" think again.I've managed 1.6 hours. I've asked Steam for a refund.The game is a huge grind; want to level up your speed or strength? Sure, go on the exercise equipment and mash your q and e buttons endlessly (YAWN). Want to level up your intelligence? Click again and again on the computers to access the Internet. And it increments everything a tiny, tiny bit. THIS IS SO BORING. How the hell is mashing your Q and E keys or mindlessly clicking an icon on screen supposed to be entertaining?!You can play full-screen if you want, but it looks terrible and might actually hurt your eyes, you can play on a window if you like, but then you have only half your screen being used. Why the game couldn't have handled this like Prison Architect does with pixel art style but proper zooming, I'm unsure. Either option looks crap and was a genuine disappointment when I first started the game.The tutorial is awful, and tells you not much at all. Again, Prison Architect does it better.The controls are clunky and feel unnatural. Everything is too restrictive, and whilst Team 17 have done a good job in emulating 16-bit gaming era in look and feel, it doesn't work to the games favour. Everything is a hassle with this control system.You have to go to rollcall, work, lunch/dinner etc. every day. And you just stand there, waiting and waiting. If they shakedown your cell you lose all your contraband... If someone beats you up, you lose your contraband, if a metal detector goes off, the guards beat you up (why they don't just search you is a mystery to me), and you lose your contraband. This isn't fun, this is frustrating.You have to 'learn' how to combine items by buying them plans of sorts off others. You have no idea if an item is important or not and you end up collecting all sorts of crap for no reason.You have a 'job', which, in the first prison, consists of: Walk to dirty laundry pile, pick up dirty laundry twice (assuming you can carry these items, otherwise you have to drop two items on the floor, which is an ordeal in itself as you have to place the items on two empty tiles on the floor), walk to washing machine, put one piece of dirty laundry into each machine, wait a few seconds, empty each washing machine, put clean clothes into the clean clothes pile. Do this about 5 times or so. Be bored out of your mind. Hit quota, job done. Right. This is fun, is it?The game doesn't 'think' like you might expect it to. If you do your work quota, surely you should be able to leave the job and do other things, right? Nope. Guards will see you, beat you up, and you lose your contraband. Putting three bedding sets down the toilet and flushing should cause it to flood, right? Nope, no issue here. Putting a comb down there might make it flood though. Great.Sometimes the game will glitch and favours you've already completed will still be pending, and you can't actually do them again to remove them from your list.Awful awful awful. So slow. So boring. It takes hours to get ANYTHING done and you just feel bored the entire time. This isn't fun or interesting, it's a boring grind and I wasn't at all expecting a boring grind to 'level up' in order to get anything done. Prison Architect was fun. This is not."
,Recommended,298630,14486924,"Posted: 15 February, 2015",all,It's Patrick,"This is a review for version 1.0, I will be updating this as the devs update the game, respectivelyOverviewIn The Escapists, you play an unfortunate prisoner, who ends up in prison for doing simple things like murdering your family or eating all the cake in the town. As a prisoner, you go about your daily prison routine to avoid drawing suspicion from the guards, all while plotting your escape. You start out in the most luxurious of prisons, gradually advancing to crummier and more difficult ones as you escape each one. There are many different ways of escaping, and the prison life is well simulated.Overall Rating: 7/10A seemingly simple prison escape game that offers a lot of gameplay for very little hard drive space. It's a nice casual/strategy game to play to get away from the other games Steam has to offer. Although, like many relatively new games, could use some improvements.Price:7/10The original price of this game in Early Access was $9.99 USD, which is what I purchased it at. Since then, the price has steadily rose due to various game expansions and improvements the developers have implemented and has settled at a reasonable $19.99 USD. Even at $20, the developers are continuing to plan and add new features, making it well worth the price.Gameplay:9/10As I've mentioned before, this game offers a surprising amount of gameplay for the little amount of hard drive space it requires. So, in the game you play as a prisoner who has to follow the daily prison routines (rollcall, eating meals, shower, exercise period, lights out, etc). While doing so, however, you must also plot your escape, utilizing various seemingly ordinary objects (duct tape, socks, files, etc) to make the tools in which you need to escape (pickaxes, weapons, shovels, etc). You can gain those items by looting your fellow prisoners' desks or simply purchasing them with money (yes, they give money to prisoners!) There are also many methods of escape, which range from accessing the air vents, tunneling your way out, pretending to be a prison guard, and organizing a prison riot. All these keep a player entertained while enjoying the pleasures of prison life.Length: 9/10In Early Access, there were very little guides. I had to figure out all the crafting recipes myself, figure out all the methods of escape myself, and spent many hours just learning the game. Now, in addition to the new content that the devs have provided us for the full release, you can easily rack up over 20+ hours just trying to escape all 6 prisons. That's not all, you can spend even more time trying to get the achievements, if that's what you do.Story: 4/10In short, the stories and text in this game are mediocre. The reason I have it as 4/10 as supposed to a 1/10 is because of the witty banter. When you see a prisoner or guard or warden or staff, you often will see them saying a humorous line or two. Things like ""I should drop you right here"" or ""My baton does the talking"" or ""Address me as your king"" or even ""Taking your wife out to dinner"". I would suggest that each prisoner and guard have their own personal diary, and depending on the person and prison, they would each have their own backstory. I also suggest that you can have actual conversatiosn with other people instead of just clicking on them and having them respond. Maybe certain things you say would affect your reputation with them.Graphics: 8/10Nice, simple graphics and animations for a nice, relatively-simple game. I suggest that the devs should implement more detail, though. If a guard is unconscious because you whacked him with a baton, a little blood on him wouldn't hurt. Little things like that will make this game better.Music/Sound: 6/10A lot of the sound in simple, and that complements the game well. More detailed sounds would be nice. Example: Steve pours molten chocolate on Officer Whitney. I would like to hear sizzling sound, or a scream, anything that shows that the chocolate is hot or the officer is in pain. As for the music, repetitive. I like how you have different types of music for different times of day. There's eating music, workout music, shower music, and night music. However, that gets repetitive, especially if you have to repeat the same daily routine over, and over, and over again. Have at least 3 tracks for each time of day. Also, having music unique to a specific prison would be nice.Performance: 10/10Performs smoothly, as expected for such a low performance-demanding game. Have found very little bugs in my time playing, which have all been minor, such as not being able to flood other prisoners' toilets, only mine.Objectives: 7/10The main objective is good (escaping), is good for the most part. The devs are planning on adding more ways of escaping and I hope that they'll balance the methods out. For example, in the easiest prison, there are several ways of escaping, but it's not balanced at all. Method one: you just need a cutting tool and an easily crafted bed dummy to escape (which can be achieved on day one) Method two: You need to dig a tunnel until it extends past the fences (which can take many days!) See what I mean? Now, for the side-quests. In this game you can do tasks for your fellow prisoners in order to earn money. These tasks range from giving them a specific item to beating up a certain person. I'd like to be able to get another prisoner to do a task for me instead of slaving, for once. I'd also like to be able to trade items with them and sell items. It would make the system a lot more realistic and fair.World: 8/10The prisons are unique in themselves, their layouts being different to provide a challenge to escapists. I like how you can explore between the walls of the prison and find loot. I don't like how you can just walk out of certain prisons and find no more landscape to challenge you or to explore. For example, Stlag Flucht, the second easiest prison in the game. You can simply walk out when you escape and find no more challenge. Where's the frozen tundra, or the frigid forest? That kind of detail in the world design would make it better.Characters: 6/10I'd like to be able to customize my inmate's looks and read their backstories and interact with them like an actual person. Give them a personality in conversations; don't have every prisoners say the same thing. Make each character unique; give them a dominant hand, give them a family that visits them, give them a gang that wants to rescure them from prison, give them body types. Example: Bob may be slightly overweight, but he can take a lot of guard tower shots. Bill may be slightly underweight, but boy can he run! Also, a very simple skill tree could enhance the game a lot. Example: a point in Sprinter would allow your character to boost his speed for a short period of time. Even your fellow inmates and guards could have skill trees to balance out the game.Item Variety: 7/10This game has a decent variety of items, some people may disagree and say this game has a lot, but I'd say decent. There are sock maces (they exist!), powered screwdrivers, fake fences, plastic key molds, flashlights, dirt, deluxe toilet rolls and so much more. The weapons I think could use some balancing. Make each weapon have its own benefits. For example: A Super Sock Mace would have a range advantage over the Hammer, which has more damage.AI: 5/10The AI is basic, needs many improvements in my opinion. Prisoners just walk around the entire period during free time. They don't try to exercise to gain strength or speed, or read books to gain intellect. Their stats should also degrade as well, which would give them some incentive to do so. Also, have them planning their escapes, too. I would like to see other inmates escape with me."
,Recommended,298630,11881204,"Posted: 26 August, 2014",all,Plebarius Afrodex IV,"This game is a fun game though it does get quite repetitive. From what I've  played it seems like the basis of advancing to a higher tier in game in which you are well situated and familiar with the prison is crafting which requires you to find crafting plans, guess, or look it up on a wiki (which makes the game reliant on external sources other than itself for its gameplay hence not self-sustaining). The ""favors"" or quests that you complete for other inmates are repetitive too as there are only two different types: A, beat someone up; or B, retrieve an item. However, there is a fun puzzle aspect to the game in figuring out how to sneak resources out from one of the three jobs you can pick as well as how to use these materials to access new areas and bypass locked doors. That being said, the worst thing in this game I would say is the leveling up system where you are literally performing menial button pressing over and over and over in order to level up and leveling up is essential as many jobs and crafting require you to have a minum level in the intellect area and you stand no chance in any type of combat (needed for the inmate quests) unless you have a high strength skill. It would be ok if you could achieve max level once and be done with it but it diminishes over time, not slowly either, so a signifigant portion of the gameplay is simply pressing q and e very fast or clicking and waiting. Being that this is an alpha build im sure these issues will be addressed, but untill then it is a decent game with some great roleplay features associated with a prison and some terrible features associated with a prison.Overall Rating - 6.75/10"

,Not Recommended,298630,32560133,Posted: 19 June,all,$wagpant$,"There’s a reason prison breaks happen far more often in fiction than reality: these places really don’t mess around. Nor, despite what its cute graphics may suggest, does The Escapists. It’s hardly a realistic simulation of life behind bars – with the prisoners quoting everything from famous movies to Breaking Bad – but it’s a fiendish little mix of sandbox and puzzle game whose six prisons take no prisoners. Metaphorically speaking, anyway…It’s a game that looks like Prison Architect’s black-sheep brother, but plays about as a regimented sandbox to first be controlled by, and then to subvert. Morning roll-call is time for everyone to gather and be told the business of the day, including whose cells are about to be inspected for contraband. Soon I realized it’s also a great time to sneak into other prisoners’ cells and carefully pocket anything good from their stash. Social times like dinner, meanwhile, offer a chance to chat with other prisoners, recruit assistance, and collect mini-quests like retrieving someone’s stolen DVD or causing a scene during the next roll-call.How much you appreciate the result will primarily depend on two factors: whether you like being left alone to figure out what to do, because the basic tutorial covers very little of what you need to know to actually escape one of the real prisons, and how annoying this repetition is going to be over time. It takes a long series of days to gather and assemble the bits that you need for an escape, and it’s easy to lose all the important ones with just the slightest mistake. You can only save at the start of each in-game day, and while there’s no death, being taken out by a random prisoner deciding they don’t like your face, or a guard screwing up your plan at the last second, can make for an excruciating time-out and loss of hard-earned progress.Each of the nine prisons offers a different-feeling challenge though, not to mention new settings, from minimum security with a cell conveniently located right by a service corridor, to a high-security facility for those who have officially transcended mere scamphood. The first has cable TV in all the rooms, the last has security cameras. Between them are a Stalag, Shankton State Pen, a jungle jail, and San Pancho, south of the border in a cloud of heat and anger. There are also currently three additional ‘custom’ prisons, including Camp Epsilon, where all cells have mesh walls for an extra-special lack of privacy and most prison life is out in the open.Mechanically of course, the goals are the same: find a weakness, and exploit it. Much of this revolves around crafting, which in a continuation of a frankly irritating current trend just assumes that you’ll go to a wiki to find out that, say, papier mache is made by combining toilet paper and superglue. It’s hard to plan when you don’t know what a game has actually planned for, especially when the character needs to hit an intelligence threshold to make so much as a glob of sticky paper. Providing the standard useful recipes up front would have been handy.Much of The Escapists is about getting the items that you need to conduct a breakout - at its simplest, a Shawshank-style dodge like finding a tool to break through a wall, a poster to hide the evidence from the screws until it’s too late. You can buy both legal and contraband items from fellow prisoners, as well as get jobs around the prison that provide access to heftier things. The laundry shift, for instance, is a great way of getting your hands on a guard uniform, even if sensors on the door make stealing one a little harder than just walking off. If someone else has the job you want, well, that’s what sharpening a comb on a wall to make an impromptu shank is for. The risk, of course, is that they’ll later return the favour at the worst possible time, and lead to all your hard work turning into a spell in the infirmary/solitary.It’s this combination of relatively simple systems that makes The Escapists work so well, with a slow build up to the actual escape attempt. Where it falls down is that in addition to its routines and focus quickly becoming repetitive, it doesn’t have much in the way of character. No, that’s too strong – it has plenty on the surface, with its adorable 16-bit style graphics, cheery prison brawls, random pop-culture quoting, and the ability to name all the characters after friends, family, co-workers, teachers, or whatever. A few minutes in though, you’re left in a world where everything is a pure puzzle game piece rather than a person, with no real sense of danger, and no characters to feel anything for beyond ‘guy who will give me $28 for punching that guy’. There’s none of the tension of even, say, Prison Break (the pretty good first series, not the terrible, terrible others) even in the most brutal, locked down jail you encounter, and after a while that’s missed. The Escapists does a great job of turning prison escape into a puzzle, but rarely does its emergent story become more than “Well, that went to crap.” It doesn’t matter while the momentum carries it, but as said, there’s a lot of downtime.My verdict.As a mix of sandbox, puzzle and open-world action, The Escapists offers something fresh and entertaining. The nature of what it’s simulating leads to some annoyances and careful handwaves to keep things light, but with both enough space between those moments to feel like I was actually producing my own plan and enough tools that I didn’t just feel like I was looking for a conveniently pre-packaged solution. It’s a clever game that’s not afraid to be challenging, and a very enjoyable puzzle if you don’t mind it also being a touch vague, often repetitive, and happy to quickly get as hard as figuring out an actual prison break."

However, the various items you need all come from an extremely repetitive source. Every in game day you have to check them and maybe you'll get something useful. In addition to that, your characters stats continually decay without 'exercise' which is a mindless button mashing game that must be done very frequently.So the puzzles presented by each prison are interesting, but the main obstacle to solving them is the amount of repetitive drudgery between you and the solution."

You play the game at your own pace, do what you want, when you want. The crafting system is great and simple, the favor system gives you things to do when your bored, or to make some extra cash. Jobs are also a thing, you can be a mailman, a janitor, and much more! You will earn a lot of enemies in prison, but maybe some friends along the way as well!The only things that are cons for me are as followed:- It will sometimes take forever to get what you need, the things people sell are most of the time just useless for what you need.- When trying to escape, if the guards find you, you are automatically caught and put in confinement without a chance to fight back, I feel that you should atleast be able to put up a fight!- The jobs ""Janitor"" and ""Gardener"" are all based off of luck, if not enough spills/weeds are around the prison, you lose your job, and sometimes it is literally impossible to complete said jobs.- I dislike that you can find the same ""Crafting Note"" over and over again, making most ""Crafting Note"" purchases worthless.- Some people dislike the workout system, of having to rapidly press ""Q and E"" to workout.

The game can be a little slow-paced at first, but once you try and escape, it becomes exciting, not to mention the satisfaction of escaping a prison. There are a lot of prisons to escape from, as well as hundreds, if not thousands, of more prisons to play via the Steam workshop. The prison design and music are both good, as well as Linux support being a plus also. There are mutliple ways to escape, depending on your styleCons: Can be confusing if you don't know what you are doing and what you have to do. I'm not going to say it for the people who haven't played this game, but for people who tried to Jungle Prison without any help... probably didn't know of the items required to escape the Jungle Prison (I had to look it up after trying to figure out how to escape myself).But still, I would highly reccomend this game, as it is fun and challenging, with many hours of fun (for me at least :P)"

I hadn't known about companies like Team17 and Mouldy Toof Studios, and this was their first title that I had seen trailers advertised for. It looked quite good, so I dug deeper. Eventually, I purchased it on Steam, it being one of my first titles owned. I hadn't expected much from it, as I tend to do with many pixelated, arcade-looking titles.However, after about 30 minutes of gameplay, it became clear to me: This was no ordinary jail game. Many games nowadays, whether they feature on a game platform (ROBLOX, Steam etc.) Or are titles released straight onto a device (XBOX, PS4 and more.), fail to reach the level of depth this game does. It features many unique aspects that, as mentioned, other jail based games do not. These things range from the environment, the way the inmates and guards behave and designs and facilities in jails.After purchasing across two platforms, XBOX and PC, and after putting in well over 50 hrs of gameplay, I can strongly agree with many that The Escapists is a title you don't want to miss out on, and is deserving of the sequel to release in just under 2 weeks time as of review date.-EzzieAnonymous, first-time reviewer."

Just started it a few days ago, reached day 14 without any progress and started watching lets plays.Some of the main tips I missed was:* be there at roll calls to know who is gonna get a cell search (if you don't want to lose everything and go in the solitary every other day)* forks can break walls, spoons can dig holes (makes escaping from earlier prisons much easier, when advanced items are harder to access)* roll of duct tape can craft you a LOT of things (poster, cutters, pickaxe, shovel, contraband pouch, tying guards, and many more things)After that and a lot of spoiling from let's plays I managed to escape the first three prisons in 5 hours. If you know all of that, it's just a matter of time and proper timing to finish the game. I kind of wish I tried it myself, but I can't even imagine how much time it would've took me if I tried to learn everything myself.So I say don't feel stupid if you give up and want to read wikis on craft recipes and which does what, the game does not have that art style just to save on artist salaries, it is also a reminder that old games were hard as ♥♥♥♥ and didn't give you step-by-step on how to wipe your own♥♥♥♥♥and left you there wondering 'what the ♥♥♥♥ do I do now?'.

This lead me onto watching a few of Paulsoaresjr's videos of the Escapists. This game looked great and the reviews I saw and heard made it sound better. This caused me to pick it up on the store, which I do not regret.Those who do not know what this game is can watch videos and look at the store page. I'd rather not type it here since you can clearly see what it is about on the store page of this game, which isn't hard to navigate to at all.The graphics are pixel-based. No anti-aliasing (It would just look like sharp edges if it did have that), and no 512x or whatever textures you have now. This game is 16-bit, surprisingly, despite it looking 8-bit.This game does not follow a linear path. We know this because you can freely choose how to escape, and how you will get the required equipment to escape. I won't say a way of escaping, since I don't want to spoil anything(and don't say that I can use spoilers for that, everyone has an urge to read them even more when they have a black bar covering them).It's Early Access. It's a rare occurence for me to buy an Early Access game, as I have had coincedents in the past with Early Access games (like with The Stomping Land). This game is actually frequently updated. I see new hotfixes appearing very frequently, and updates none-too-far-apart. Although this game only got nigh-over £7,000 on Kickstarter, this game is one of the most frequently updated in my library, if not the most. This shows a high level of appreciation that the developers have for their own game, since they continue to constantly update their game frequently despite it having an incredibly low budget(I personally only see Kickstarter funds as motivation to continue making the game, and not as a budget, though)(£7,000 is not much when it comes to games).Finally, it was published by Team 17. So, it's not an indie game by definition, but in our hearts it is. If you didn't know (in which case,shame on you), Team 17 were the developers for games in the Worms series. That's what they are known for, you can't deny that. If a developer like Team 17 who made one of the most iconic game series known to man published a small game like this, they must have a whole lot of trust in this.

I guess it is like a RPG (role playing game), you have to grind all the time in the hardest prison which is bad but the game makes up for it by making you happy about escaping or finding the rare item that you need to craft something to help you escape which might make or brake the game for you. But you can't say its not a great feeling when you overcome something difficult. The art style is good for pixels, the top down point of view or POV is ok but not great. NPCs are cool with a like you meter as i call it it is a meter that tells you how much an NPC likes you and that will affect many things to how much discount you are given to if they will fight for you or look the other way if you beat someone up. If you do that the bar will go down a little bit they also make many references to a variety of movies, games, books and TV shows. Combat could use a better system because it is hit space and then left click once and you sit and wait it does not need to be a click click click to fight just like a power attack or quick attack would be fine and the layout of all prisons are great hugely different and detailed. this game gets a 9.0 maybe 9.4 for new update with building prisons but not many great ones yet hopefully in the future there is. Thanks for reading and i recommend this game. I guess i have zero punctuation ha ha ha"

The gameplay is very interesting having you switch between ""agressive"" and ""passive"" mode for combat by hitting ""Q"", and taking up random favors for your fellow inmates ranging from finding a Paper Clip to beating the tar out of a guard to get his Uniform for the cosplaying Inmate. There aren't many possibilities for escape besides the typical tunnel out or sneak out. The game at this time is still in EA so bugs are expected but they aren't terribly game-breaking.

The enjoyment of planning out your whole escape in anyway you want it to be. It even has quite some challenges as you progress further into each prison. The same tactics used in previous ones can't always be used (well could, but be much more difficult), which makes the player try to find flaws in the security and use that to his/her advantage. As you spend your days in prison, you could get help from prisoners or just beat them up and take any items you need to plan your escape, heck some can even help you beat the other inmates up. This game provides quite some replay-ability (assuming you wanna find another route to leave from or how fast you can do it). There are plentiful of items in the prison, which can be used for crafting items to aid you in your efforts in busting out. The biggest thing it also allows is the challenge of sneaking out of jail as well (even though you plan your route, you don't really know the guard's patterns too well at night) by any means: Bars, guards, snipers, searchlights, fences, walls, etc. It provides quite some fun planning and going though with the escape to live a free life out of your cage.

I was caught after i murdered and buch on ManBearPies with a roll of Duct Tape and plastic knifes. My first day of prison life begins.Day 1: Woke up with guards ring the bell for rollcall, My Name was called ""Them Sheep"" I Said in anger, first day and my name is call, well it luckly all I had in my desk was a toothbush, toothpaste and I don't know what else.Food Time, I love the taste of over cooked bland chicken that tastes of sawdust and comes fresh from a can, ""Plastic Fork, These will be handy"" I grab a few and looked for a sutable wall (Don't ask, just know it works).The Shower room was empty and for some reason guards were every dumb. I kept chipping at the wall till it broke into another block of wall (This is impossable right).I put the wall block and thought of my escape even more ""I need knives... Plastic ones"", I rushed back to the canteen and grabed a few (It was lucky, all I need four for my daring escape).Next step, Make a bed dummy... mmm two pillows and a blaket, that will work, the guards here have a memory of a goldfish and a attention span of another goldfish after finding out he was born.OK... put that one bed, make a rope. All I need for that is two bed sheets Nice.The cover of night fall.... Im Batman... Wait no, Correction.... The night rollcall of the annoying blasted bells rang of couse I get... no wait false alarm, I missed the shakedown, sod it its time to do the escape.I rushed to were the wall was broken.Up some random ladders,Used Rope to get to ground,and.....Day 2: Used the knives on the fence till it gave away.Then I walked out like some kina boss man, acting badass after a meeting about cakes,I turned around and saw the guards making tea, I casually walked in,Stole there donuts,and walked back out (Well I needed food for the walk I guess)End10/10 Would be put back into confiment agian...Wait a sec!!"

Please know that this is just from my own experiences and the game is still in early access.CategoryDescriptionPointsGraphics/AnimationsThe graphics in this game are very simple (pixels), but very nice in the same sense. One thing that does bother me personally though is that everyone looks like they are constantly running. Even when they are sitting down they still look like they are running.9/10GameplayThis game isn't for everyone, with that being said, it takes a lot of time and planning to achieve a successful escape. Most of the time you will find yourself doing excercise to build strength and scavenging for materials. It is unique in many ways though and for these reasons I enjoy the gameplay.8/10Mechanics/Misc.The game's mechanics certainly aren't unique or complex, but they work nonetheless. Some aspects don't feel complete to say the least. Fighting mechanics are very basic, consisting of activating combat mode and then clicking your target which it will then automatically fight for you, winning/losing depending on your muscle and health. One big issue that I've found is how easy it is to escape from a fight. You can hit a guard and then if you just run away and get out of their sight for a few seconds they will forget about you.7.5/10Overall: 8/10 - Enjoyable but could be better.I overall enjoyed this game, but in it's current state, if you are interested it would be best to wait until the price is lowered. If you can get passed all of it's downsides in it's current state, go ahead and purchase this game.It has a lot of potential though, as it is only in early access."

The music is pretty good as well.Overview: Great game, awesome art style, good music, not for the person looking for a story based game, but it can be interesting to see people complete certain maps, it can be one of those games where you get the sudden urge to go on wikia and study up about the game. And for anyone looking for a prison simulator, this and prison architect are your best bets. I'd recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun, unqiue game to sink a couple dozen hours into.Hope this was helpfull! :D"

,Recommended,298630,15934835,"Posted: 21 May, 2015",all,Evil Morty,"Hey, it's quite amazing, you should play it too, And i have a suggestion Dev's, mabye have a system in the map editor to make certain items illegal, or make new items? [Included with the map's download of subscribed of course] this way it can spice up game-play, and you should also make it so other inmates get in trouble for being like naked, or in trouble for things we get in trouble for, and get placed in solitary if you stashed something in their desk, and you should make plastic knives have a tendensy to bend/dull as you cut a wall, i think if you did this with every chipping/mining tool in the game, it could liven up the game, make you have to work EXTREMELY hard to escape in certain prisons with this or just plain in every prison have it! And i think you should be able to change characters in the name menu by like middle clicking or something, like a inmate to a guard and back, of course if you have a 5 guard min. in that prison then allow him/her to make 5 different guards or everyone as a guard, basically a challenge for the person in the game! I have only 2 more suggestions, the first is an add inmate to the list [Has a min and max] and remove inmate from the list, and an add guard to the list, remove from the list. This is my last suggestion, for people to live out their sentence if they take too long, losing the game, in certain prisons [Central] I think like 50 or 60 days should do it, But then again, my opinion, so dev's if you add this to the game, i will be very happy, but i'm already happy with the game-play, i'm just requesting an update with like 1/10 of this stuff, i don't mind if you don't add all of them, i will be happy you just add one, thank you for this terrific game and gameplay, i've been hooked on this game since it came out, sadly i hadn't the money to buy it until a week ago, thanks again. - Dah Kitteh"

Just to quickly sum it up, I think this game has pretty good potential, but just needs more features. I think there needs to be a lot more crafting recipes, whether they do something or not. For example, I want to be able to combine a wire with a knife to create a knfie with a wire around it.

The gameplay is simplistic but it keeps me coming back. It is a fun game all around, and some of the interactions have made me laugh.Bad: Game is almost too simplistic. What I mean by the prior is that, you do the same thing 40 times before you make any headway, which is fine, I understand that the game is in Early Access and it is for a reason, but at the same time, this point of the game development is strictly based around ""Let's hope they just get lost in prison"", because half my game time is structured around just doing usual prison crap. There isnt any gore which frankly bothers me, I stab a guy forty times with a shiv and it looks like im slapping him with my di**Ugly: Holy hot♥♥♥♥♥♥♥from hell there are spelling errors. The game is based out of the UK, which means ""favor"" is spelt ""favour"" these are not the spelling errors im referecing, in the general game itself when you speak to other inmates (of which there is almost little interaction) they say one of like.... 6 poorly spelt phrases and continue on their way, and it isnt meant to be misspelled for ""hey its prison these people are stupid effect"" it might've just been laziness with the devs..What Could We Do to Improve? Im not going to suggest mutliplayer like many others have, I would like to see more prisons, and a bit more strict time lines, I would also like gore and some sort of better violence, perhaps people get released, and new people come in, you might have to share a cell or something. But there are some serious bugs that need to be worked out. When someone punches me, and I punch someone in retailiation, and the cops only see me? I get wailed on for half an hour, and these guys just dont stop, they chase your♥♥♥♥♥all over, and if you go outside? ""BOOM HEADSHOT"", yes you get freaking sniped walking outside.Overall: This game is worth 10$ if it increases Do Not Buy. Bottomline, I have seen small development from this game, and I would like to continue seeing it. If the game becomes mutliplayer, I might just stop playing it all together."

(You know, the prison on the island in san fransisco?)you can buy materials off of other prisoners too, but only with money, which can be earned by doing a favour for a prisoner (like beating up 'this' person) or doing your job.your prisoner starts off with puny stats, and you can improve these by going on a treadmill or doing push ups.

The end of the day. If you attempt an escape at day, you'll be insta killed by all-seeing snipes placed everywhere. And this is Minimum Security? Anyway...My plan was to get a guard outfit using a contraband bag, crawl into the vents use my plastic utility key and make my way to the roof. I'd use a bedsheet rope to scale down the ceiling, and cut my way out.This is my first time playing this game, remember. I forgot to make a bed dummy, and the guards found my empty cell.So, I had to do the whole day over again, or have to do the entire escape plan over again.The whole day. So it ended up becoming everytime I found something useful for my escape, I waited for the end of the day so if I got caught, I wouldn't have to buy it from the RNG merchants again. Like, getting the contraband bag was huge hassle. The guards came after me, I got beat up and they took my bag. I had to spend two in game days trying to find a merchant to sell me the damn materials because they sell different stuff each time.Anyway! I failed my escape attempt, did the whole day over again. I went into the vents and was unscrewing the vent infront of the utility shaft to the roof. I would put down a stepladder to go back up and replace the vents so I wouldn't be teleported instantly to solitary confimement. (which is BS by the way. if they find anything wrong, you'll insta-lose and go to solitary and have to redo the whole day.)So, I was unscrewing the vent, unscrewed it and BOOM insta-lose. There just happened to be a guard walking by and saw the vent go up. I just realized that at night, you can't see what's under the vents like you can at day. I had already tried this escape plan 3 times before. First time I got to the roof, but they discovered my empty cell. Redo the day. 2nd time I forgot to get my guard outfit because I had waited the whole day last time. Redo the day. Third time, a guard jsut happened to walk by.So now, I have to hope that when I unscrew the vents, a guard wont walk by before I can replace it.Or else I'll have to redo the day.I AM SO SICK OF HAVING TO REDO THE DAY.The day's are long and boring once your escape plan is in place. If you mess up, it just becomes waiting until night-time simulator.This would all be fixed if I could quick-save. I'm a ♥♥♥♥ing noob at the game, and looking at walkthroughs for the ""first day"" escape or whatever is, in my mind, cheating.  Just let me quick save at night so I can try again. The people who are good at this game can do ironman mode or whatever but don't ♥♥♥♥ me.I got ♥♥♥♥ed so many times playing this game. If you wan't to buy this, make sure your plan is foolproof. How do you know it's foolproof? Either a)looking on the internet) (which I think is cheap) or b) trial and error). Trial and error, however, is punished.SO WHAT THE FOUR HEART SIGNS AM I GONNA DO!?How ever, the game is still fun for other reasons.Just really wish it had quick saving."

,Recommended,298630,14318052,"Posted: 3 February, 2015",all,O_o,"I bought this game while in early access and I am updating the review as this game has changed quite a bit.This game is a strategy game that requires timing, knowledge, and patience. You will not get through this game doing nothing but beating up guards. I played this game without looking at the wikipedia, and in my 50 or so hours I beat every normal prison, none of the DLC prisons, even though I own all of them, (Including Fort Bamford because I bought the game in Early Access). This game is worth the money just looking at the hours of playtime you get from it. Enjoyment is a different thing, not everyone will like the game.Foremost is graphics, it is a 2D top-down view, and the art style is very pixelated. However, this means you do not need a high end computer to run it. Most computers will be able to run this game as it is a lightweight program.The gameplay like I said earlier is very strategic and it requires a bit of luck with the patrol of the guards. You need an escape strategy and, depending on the prison, sometimes there is only one way out that requires specific items. Most items needed in escaping are contraband, they will be taken if seen by guards, and you will be reset if guards find any in your desk or find a hole in a wall or the ground. This makes for very chaotic gameplay, ""Quick. move the desk, get in, dig dig dig, get out, place the desk!"", that sort of thing.In conclusion I would reccomend this game, it is an amazing single player game and I definitely consider escaping some of those prisons as achievements."

Even some famous ones such as Stalag Fluct or Alcatraz. I once really liked this game. ONCE. When you first start playing it will seem really fun. Like really fun. But when you beat all the prisons and want to do steam workshop prisons you get bored really really fast. Other than that its a great game but i assure you after 72 hours of it you will get really bored.Layout- 8Graphics- 10Fun- 4Overall- 6

The game provides a tutorial, three save files, six challenging prison maps to escape, four DLCs, a whole community of map makers and the tools to make your own map with the additional Escapists: Map Maker (comes along with the purchase of The Escapists)Start off with daily routine and earn cash by doing jobs for the prison or for fellow cellmates, steal from guards and cellmates, craft dozens of unique tools and weapons, break open vents, dig underground tunnels, make gangs; whatever required to escape the prison! I highly reccomend it for those who love strategic games and crafting games. I'd give it 4 Stars and a 9/10. There still are some glitches like the NPCs getting confused when you sit in a seat the bots target to sit in at lunch and some just annoying things like the player immediatly getting sent to solitary while trying to escape. (guards should just come out and find the player if they are to be caught.) Developers should fix this but those are small details that don't ruin the entire game. They have gotten annoying to me though. Anyways 4 Stars/ 9 out of 10!"

The thought of escape makes you nervous and excited. On the downside, there are lots of bugs, like if you have items in the toilet and then exit out, when you come back in, they are gone. Also, sometimes left-clicking on people with an ""!"" above there head doesn't do anything. It would be nice, as well, to be able to use the scroll bar to toggle through items in your inventory. It would also be amazing if there was an online co-op where you and your friends could escape prison together. Overall, a great game, but needs some improvements."

,Recommended,298630,15234793,"Posted: 6 April, 2015",all,CyberusUK,"Developed by Mouldy Toof Studios The Escapists places you in the role of a convicted felon trying to escape from prison. Prison games aren’t the most original of ideas right now, but there take on it is quite unique. It’s currently out on Early Access on steam, so expect bugs and issue’s if you take the plunge. The game has an 8bit style that’s reminiscent of the games on the NES and gives the game a really stylised feel. The Escapists isn’t afraid to poke fun at its self too, you’ll often find yourself chuckling at the odd line a guard says or an awkward moment in the showers.The main idea is of course to escape, but the game gives you a huge amount of choices on how to do that. Will you build a tunnel under ground, or pose as a guard? Will you climb into the ventilation system or chip through the walls? There is no set method and no dead set rules. But before you even think of escape there are other considerations.Prison life starts in the morning with role call, this is where you will find out who’s cell will be tossed. If its yours I hope you’ve not left any contraband or signs of escape for the guards to find as this will set you back to square one again, you’ll lose all you’ve worked so hard to acquire and all your holes and false walls will be filled in.After role call your day will be broken up into meal periods, exercise time, shower time and free periods/work periods. Through out the day you will be interacting with other inmates, buying items from them or taking jobs from them. These jobs range from acquiring for them a comb shiv to causing a distraction in the showers so your fellow inmates can dish out some rough justice. These jobs will improve your standing with said inmate and earn you money but might cause the victim to take a less positive view of you, eventually they may come looking for revenge. Guards that you’ve had run-ins with in the past might attack you on sight and leave you in the infirmary. You’ll find your constantly walking a popularity tight rope, it adds a nice dynamic to the game.Your inmate has three skills that he can improve too, strength is the first. Improving strength with bench presses or push ups will increase your health. Speed is the second, this is improved by running on a treadmill or other cardio workouts. This skill is strange as it doesn’t improve your movement speed but rather how fast you can attack. Lastly is your intelligence skill, Improved by browsing the web or other knowledge based ventures. This improves what you can craft and is perhaps the most important skill in the game. You may want to take the time to improve these skills to keep you alive long enough to put you escape plan into action.Don’t be fooled by the cute graphics or stylised charm of The Escapists, the game is not easy. It draws you in with a nice easy tutorial, but that’s it. After this you don’t get any help, your on your own. At times this can be infuriating, when you’ve been struggling for hours to put the perfect escape plan together only to be caught by a slight miss step. But! And its a big but, when you get it right its amazing. The game can be hard, but I can promises you that you’ll find yourself going back for more and more.For full review seehttp://cyberusuk.com/2015/01/27/the-escapists-review-should-it-be-kept-behind/"

In this game you go threw prisons trying to escape. Atfirst it is very confussing but as you go along it gets very simple. NO prison is repetative every prison offers new challedges and a new enviroment. Alcatraz is my personal favorite it even has the same layout of the actual alcatraz. There is no real cons with the game other than crafting notes are nessacaery to escape and if you dont get a bed dummy then your in trouble. Every day in the prison offercs something new. From favors such as beating up guards to stealing items its all fun. If you are confussed at all there is a help button when you hit escape wich is kind of like a inn game wiki. Even if i am just diving into this game i still absouluty love it. The schedual is one of my favorite parts every little thing matters skipping lunch and other stuff always always always have a job it is a good source of money building a crew is rewardeing aswell even if it is the hardest thing in the game to do. There is also a sence of acomplishment after each prison

Run off to your cell while they talk and fit your pickaxe, shovel, guard uniform, and cell key in your pockets!Well this review probably is harsh, I am giving the benefit of the doubt that these sorts of things will improve over time.

Pretty quickly, I realized the sad truth of this game. It's far more basic than it appears to be, and a lot of the problems come from the actual game design, and many are very hindering to the game itself.Pros-Decent art style-Interesting concept-Steam Workshop Support(custom maps/prisons)Cons-weak execution (game is very basic and barebones with what it could have been)-RNG dependant that can easily be crushed by another RNG mechanic (Need a rare contraband? Your room might get searched the next day and you will not only lose it, but get solitary for a few days which will murder your skill points)-Mouse Cursor is not very accurate to what you want it to do-Only a handful of prisons, even with DLC-The best ways to escape a prison are pure cheesingHonestly....even when it was on a 75% sale, I find it very hard to consider this game worth it. I sadly got 3 hours of enjoyment from the game, so I might not even be able to refund it. I would be wary about getting this game, even at such a great sale.

Everything that happens is highly-transient.  Buff yourself out?  Better spend a lot of time lifting weights, or you'll get weak.  Got a shiv?  You'll lose it when you get beat up, when your cell gets searched, or when someone else's cell gets searched.  Good luck getting the key you need; it'll vanish as soon as the guard wakes up--whoever's desk you hide it in, they get searched the next day about 80-90% of the time.As for how to play?  Just beat people up, steal their stuff, lift weights for half the time, and get beat up to clear all the negative stuff.  You'll spend most of your time trying to find one item (a screwdriver or a key).  You can get a job for money, if you want to spend 4 hours of gameplay getting $20; or you can spend 40 seconds lifting weights, then beat up inmates for other inmates.  You could craft a weapon, or just weight lift a hell of a lot.It's a lot of doing nothing."
,Not Recommended,298630,16361921,"Posted: 13 June, 2015",all,novalinnhe,"This is actually a really fun game, and a fantastic premise - you are an inmate with grandiose dreams of escaping prison, and it's your task to spend your days observing prison life and stockpiling the resources you'll need to actually do it. I really enjoyed the time I spent with it, but I seem to have a bug which ruins the game for me.Whenever I reload from a previous state - whether in game, or when I come back to my computer and load the game up fresh - everything except the day I have saved on resets. Any items I have stashed away disappear, regardless of whether I leave them in safe or non-safe places (yep - all desk items simply vanish), all of the crafting notes I have collected are removed from the notebook, and anything my player was carrying (both in terms of equipped weapon and the 6 inventory slots) either randomises or disappears entirely. Sometimes items will randomly reappear on other unconscious inmates, but that's about it. The only things actually ""saved"" when saving the game seems to be my stats, and the tasks saved on my to-do list.If this pretty essential feature worked, I reckon I'd be quite a fan of The Escapists and recommend it as one of the most interesting indie titles I've ever come across. There is little to no hand-holding in this game which I especially love about it - you are literally left on your own to observe, explore, discover and devise. But if all my hard work observing, exploring, discovering and devising is going to be wiped any time I come back to the game (or even simply reload the day with the game still running!), I'm afraid I couldn't actively recommend this to anybody.Update: Heard from a friend that this bug was ""fixed"", so uninstalled and re-installed the game only for essentially the same things to happen again. Everything I've stockpiled disappeared. And I'm never warned or given solitary time, so I can say with certainty that it is the game itself and not the guards clearing those areas which is the problem. I don't mind that you can't save until the very end of the day; I can deal with that. But simply having everything as it was at point of saving should really be a given for a save feature... so this will sadly remain a downvote. A real shame, as I love the gameplay itself."

,Not Recommended,298630,14805203,"Posted: 9 March, 2015",all,Fantastic,"Games that expect you to use a wiki to figure everything out are not my thing, and the systems in this game are designed in a way that makes me feel gross.You find crafting recipes or buy them with character-specific dollars, and your ""crafting recipes found"" journal is per-character. This makes me feel like I have no progression because I want to start a new character if I end up hating the layout of the loot and how I've done on my current character and I always start from square 1 with the crafting stuff.There is only one prison until you beat that first one, and beating the first one is a hell of a task. This means if you ♥♥♥♥ up on the first one 25 times and start to get sick of the exact same routines and level layout every time you are SOL unless you manage to beat it or play the other two, much harder prisons that are unofficial.The fullscreen on 16:9 monitors is just the normal aspect ratio of the game stretched grossly wide, like an emulator set to stretch an NES game to 1080p that makes Mario twice as fat. It's really terrible and is the only option.The emergent gameplay of the prison is minor and less deep than it seems at the outset. You can easily knock out any prisoner by hitting them once and then running them into a guard while they chase you, let them hit you once and then the guard beats them to unconsciousness. You can make people miss their quota for their job by beating them up a bunch during work hours and then take their job. You can plant contraband in their cells. You can make people hate you and then coax them into fighting you and use them to cause a distraction or go somewhere they wouldn't. These things are kind of cool. But not enough to base a game around.If you fight a guard, all you can do is knock them out for 30 seconds, and if you take one of their keys they immediately game over you when they wake up. Also, if you run away after beating them up sometimes they just forget, sometimes there is no repercussion, sometimes they chase you around forever, and sometimes an unseen sniper in the corner of the map will shoot you in the face until you die. Which of these four things happens is decidedly random.Escaping, the whole point of the dang game, sucks. Digging is this awful minecrafty thing where you have pickaxes or pickaxe-like items that very quickly decay as you use them to dig through a foot of dirt, and then when they break you have to go get more. Tools you need desperately are either totally randomly found, difficult to craft with no way to figure out how the recipes work, which have some amount of sense, but, come on, paper meche = toilet paper & super glue? People who have played the early access version rattle off absurd, stupid crafting items like a ""bed decoy"" and 'fake vent cover"" that just scream that the game's systems are buried so deep in their own BS that they feel the need to overdesign to cover their own flaws. Why build a game where you need three tiers of pickaxes and bed roll decoys and cell curtains and instant death snipers? Silliness.Vital items are hidden in one-time random loot crates that disappear forever after finding them and can contain garbage or incredibly valuable things and the seed changes every time you load so you have to save scum if you want something in particular.Oh and all the text stuff is all over the place in grammar and spelling, full of memes and nonsense most of the time, and you read it all within the first few hours. Sure there's some neat ideas but pulled off in a way that feels very mediocre.I still find myself coming back and might revise this review. It's kind of fun in some ways but just so frustrating."

It's important to know what's required of you, and the last thing you want to do is waste time, since time spent in the slammer is accounted into your final score.I escaped Center Perks by cutting through the fence at night wearing a guard outfit after spending a few days bulking up to knock out a cop to replicate his key to get outside after Lights Out.

Not to mention that a single bad luck or mistake can dramatically cripple your progress so far and set you back tremendously and I'm only talking about prison of ""moderate"" difficulties (harder ones are not yet implemented). But all of this make success all the more satifying.It's a quirky game with it's own charm. It certainly can make the blood of rage quitters boil. But those who welcome games that can be harsh at times will become obcesed with pulling off that perfect escape and grabing that high score. Sinking many hours in this doing so.This is only an early access game and should not be judged as a full release.

I find $18 for this game is very steep considering how much the game actually contains and the pixelated graphic style. If you can get it for free somehow, or have a friend give it to you as a gift, I would recommend it. Otherwise, do not drop all that hard earned cash of yours on this at the moment.

To dig out of the prison, you need to use Timber Supports, which take 2 timer per square -- I'd like to add that timber is very rare to find in someone else's desk, and no one sells them...5.

The initial reward is very fun, exploring the first prison increasing relations, collecting items, and stepping out of line. It all culminated in my daring escape plan which involved simply collecting cutlery and cutting through walls and fences. I then moved on to the next prison, and as it turned out it was as simple as... collecting cutlery and cutting through walls and fences.You'll love the first 1-2 hours and dread the monotony of the rest of the game. It's incredibly repetitive and lacks enough depth (even with its incredibly difficult prison maker). Get prison architect instead- it'll last far longer.Pros:-Great concept-Fun first few hours-Great humour and visualsCons:-Very repetitive-Not much depth5.5/10"

But those flaws, are somehow, sometimes, enjoyable.I definately suggest getting this game, as it's very fun. But if you get mad easy, avoid this like the plague.Update: The game feels like it intentionally tries to ♥♥♥♥ you over for no real good reason.I.E.Unlocked door led to you. Even though it's the second day and you don't even have a plastic key, nor did you open♥♥♥♥♥♥up yet.Inventory mysteriously disapearing, but game still registers it as if it's still there, losing clothes, getting yelled at for not having clothes even though there's a person without clothes right next to you, going to steal jail clothes from the laundry, then for some odd reason having heat go to 100% immedietly as you leave the laundry room, getting shot by snipers, because you dared to get some clothes like they demanded.Stuff randomly repairing itself, random cell raiding, getting punched, then getting in trouble, Punching a guard, then getting shot with a ♥♥♥♥ing sniper rifle, seems a bit excessive but whatever.Essentially, annoying Alpha elements that hold the game back in it's current form. I don't reccomend buying it YET, As soon as it hits Beta, I'd suggest buying it then. Still a fun as hell game, just being held back by bugs and minor annoyances. Buy if you want to support development, till then, the fun is being held back, trust me. Great game, just wait a lil while.The Devs are really fricken cool though, seriously, I would buy this game just to help them out."

76561198176250022,Not Recommended,298630,29713004,Posted: 5 February,all,ThetaSigma,"I can understand why people like this game. The simplistic, pixellated graphics - look really good - at least in windowed mode. The concept of escaping from a number of prisons using nothing more than your wits (and what you get in your drawer. And what you get from doing favours) is brilliant in theory. The soundtrack adds to the feel of the game. But The Escapists, for all of its successes and positive press, is not without its shortcomings.For me, when I first picked up the game, my first thoughts were ""Is this seriously the loading screen..."" and ""How do I get this into fullscreen?"" After fixing the settings and starting the game, I found that the graphics, which seemed to be stretched to fit the entire screen, made the squarish tiles seem rectangular, the text seem stretched and all of the characters seem out of proportion. The text boxes that appeared over the characters' heads didn't add to the aesthetic either - they just seemed like people yelling out the same random drivel day after day - no conversation, no dialogue, no nothing.The gameplay did nothing for me either. The tutorial was just enough to explain the basic controls, which felt unnatural to me. Clicking on things to interact with them but requiring (or at least showing) WASD to move felt like it was a bit of a nuisance to move the cursor every time I wanted to even so much as look at my desk - not to mention how easy it was to accidentally pick it up and annoy the guards - but the gameplay itself to me felt very grindy, with little payoff and no sense of progression. After the first few days in the first prison, I felt that I was getting nowhere, had no clue what I was supposed to be doing, and was just repeating the same day over and over with no real way of going forward (which the tutorial should have explained.) It was just a matter of: Get up. Stand in one spot for a few seconds. Go and move to a room and sit in the same spot. Look for people to trade with. Do the laundry. Go and spam some buttons. Stand in the same spot for a few seconds. Look for trades again. Go and sit in a certain spot. Go and stand in a certain spot. Go to bed. Repeat.Once again, I feel like this was a good concept, poorly executed for a PC game. I would be fine with it as a premium mobile experience, but I feel like it is a bit simple for a $20 PC game."

,Not Recommended,298630,32419317,Posted: 14 June,all,downstroy,"One of the worst game I have ever played:- VERY repetitive gameplay 'smashing 2 buttons for about 15% of your game time)- VERY repetitive jobs (library/ laundry/ licence plate etc) where you basically do the same thing over and over again- VERY repetitive ""randomly"" generated tasks to do: inmate will give you job which are either of 4( !!!!) things: beat this guy (inmate/ guard, make a diversion, which is basically beat someone up, or retrieve an item)I could get over all this repetition, but twhat really kills it is the flippin unintuitive receipe for crafting stuff.So I get a lighter and a magazine, guess I could start a fire? Nope.So I have nails, a hammer and a wood chunk, guess I can make a nail bat? Nope.So I have a file, guess I can make a weapon out of it. Nope.And the list go on and on, which leads the player to use the wiki for all it's crafting, because the receipe basically makes no sense.I coul get over it if the item interaction were pleasant and understandable, but here too, it fails to deliver again. You can dig a hole in the ground using a plastic spoon (!!!) but not with a metal spatula, or with a foil?So basically I can't recommand this game. The gameplay while promising a lot delivers very little. I could have seen it be a great game, if they approched it using multiplicative interaction between items (lighter + anything that have a fuel value could start a fire, wood + anything that have a damage value could make a weapon etc), but instead the choice was that each item can only be used for a very specific list of receipe, which are not even intuitive.TLDR: boring and repetitive, only aspect interesting are convoluted and not well done: don't recommand it."

Even for a guy who plays mostly FPS shooters with amazing graphics, this game gets to me. The concept of breaking out of a prison is fascinating to me. Having the opportunity to plan your escape with all little details is something I personally love. It's all up to you to get the stuff you need and finally escape with a raft - yes, that is an option too in one of the prisons!+ Excellent in it's concept+ Hundreds of craftables+ Option to create your own prison and share it with others+ Time waster. Hours just go by when you get into this+ As a Prison Break (the TV-show) fan I have to give thumbs up to San Pancho, which was designed as Sona+ This game wouldn't be so charming without pixel graphics+ Unique free time music in every storyline prison. I love all of the soundtracks+ Easy mechanics. When fighting, you just let your character do the job. It's not rocket science+ Name your prisoners and guards! This has been a blast going into prison with your friends- No multiplayer- Could be a little more realistic. There's many things to do but I feel like there could be more detail- Guards are too observant. Move step away from prison and your heat rises immediately. Even when youre going to, let's say for example exercise period, sometimes guards still get shook and heat rises. Guard mechanics need work.This is not a negative thing to me, but I say it anyway. This game requires a lot of farming. That means you have to spend time to get things you need to escape. Sometimes you have to wait days to get one item in sale that you need. I don't mind, but it's not for everyone.I highly recommend this game."

Not to mention that you have to Googlea lot,to find out what you have to do.

Maybe simulation games aren't for me, or maybe this game is not very good. It felt like a cut down version of Habbo hotel.Strangely, this is one of the few games which is more enjoyable to watch somebody else play than play it yourself."

It does use a launcher though, which is quite annoying.GameplayThe objective of this game is to escape from a prison (as you probably guessed). There is a routine that you must follow (like  roll call, breakfast, job/leisure period, etc). Whilst doing this, you must collect items that will help you escape from the prison. There is a lot you can do, and some pretty cool hidden features. There are currently 6 main prisons, with a bonus 8.Final ThoughtsThis game is definitely a must-have for those who love puzzle/escaping games. For 15 dollars, the price is a bit steep, so you should wait for a sale before purchasing. Below is a list of pros and cons:Pros- Great game mechanics and features- 8-bit style game- Active community- Replayability- Steam Community WorkshopCons- Only able to save after a full day has passed, which is several minutes long- Repetitive dialogue- Somewhat unreasonable priceIn conclusion, this is an excellent prison escape game, with its major setback being the price. -8/10"

The Prisions are tough to break out of and the crafting is hard. You need to stick to your daily routines or the guards get angry. You need to be patient with this game so you can plan your escape.Center Perks:Center Perks is the easiest prision to escape from. No one hates you and the guards are quite nice. You start with the laundry job which can acesses you to the guards outfit. A tip is that you should never dig in an open space. The guards will find you. Another tip is to cover your tracks. It helps if you don't want to go to solitary. This Prison is is a really easy one to escape. The fact that it has an open space is good. The Tower Guard Locations are also really well done.Stalag Flucht:This Prision is a big leap from Center Perks. The guards are suddenly meaner and less people like you. For this Prision your going to need a lot of Strength to take down guards. The Plastic Red Staff Key always helps. For this you learn that the Blue fence = Electrical. What I like about this Prision is it appears to be hard but its quite well designed and easy to escape from.Shankton State Pen:This Prision is the first really indor prision. It has increased Contraband detectors so its not easy to smuggle things. My reccomendation is that you get a lot of Contraband Pouches and the Woodshop job. This Prision was well made with the interior. The fact that it has extra security but not much is goodJungle Compound:The Jungle Compound has a medium of security. The Guards go everywhere except for a few locations. My tip for this Prision is to stick to your routine and try to escape every chance you have. What I like about this Prision is the fact that is has only one way to escape which is by getting ID Papers. I alos like how there is a Perimiter Jeep which can be quite annoying if you aren't careful.San Pancho:This Prision is tough. Barley any Camea's and Few Contraband Detectors but its tough. This Prision isn't nice to you. Only 4 Guards ever enter. The three for the Rollcall ect and one for desk searching. All the Prisioners hate you completely and want to kill you. There are lots of fights and guards don't help. My tip is getting the Tailor Job, Break the wall infront then dig until you reach the Concreat. What I like about this Prision is how it introduces a Prision with seemingly no guards. I also like how you get to experience the annoyingness of mines. (The Music is great)HMP Irongate: HMP Irongate is a hard Prision to escape from. There are a lot of Camera's and a lot of Contraband Detectors. You get barley any free time. What I like about this Prision is the fact that it goes from not much security to massive security. If you want to escape your going to need to work hard.Hope you enjoyed my review! Overall. Great Game.-Hyper | jskerritt"

It's one of few games where I'd honestly suggest watching a walkthrough of it rather than playing it yourself, since on one hand it's fun to see all the crazy ways to escape, but on the other there were so many moments where I just felt I had spent entire in game days making zero progression.

I played it to long to get a refund but most of my time on it was not having fun. I might try to continue going to see if it gets better as I learn more but so far it is very lack luster.Although it is claimed that there are lots of ways you co do things almost anything you try will fail due to illogical AIHere are some examples.All gaurds carry various keys but you can't pick pocket them and none of them go to the main gate.If you knock out a gaurd and take a key then run and hide, when he wakes up you will be magically teleported to solitary confinment without them finding you.Stashing contraban in another prisoners cell does not get them in trouble.Also no one can permantly die, you don't have an actual sentence or anything and there is no long term repercussions for good or bad behaivore just a bit a skill drop if you spend the night in solitary,It's hard to explain in text but the game just feels stifling and pointless.There is no shake downs or lock downs. You don't follow inmates in line or get marched around, really its all choas.you can spend the whole day hiding or doing something you not suppose to get caught and then hit a gaurd with a weapon and then just run in circles until your Heat level dies back down. Or just walk right past gaurds and go somewhere you shouldn't be and they just complain a little and do nothing until your heat is at 90% and again you can just run around in a circle and wait for it to die down to 89% and then just go back to where you should be.Nothing makes any sense in the game, like none of it is simulated. i could go on but really I have nothing good to say about this game except that maybe its a challange.Read more negative reviews or watch some gameplay video before buying this game."

Where You Escape And That STUPID jeep ALWAYS gives you a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ trust me i have failed to escape this prison MANY times myself. getting items for your tools can take a LOT of time. i reccomend if you have trouble with finding some items use these tips:1. Work and get a LOT of money.(or complete tasks)2. fink inmates who are selling♥♥♥♥♥♥3. but those items you need. (or just serch as much desks as you can in your freetime)I hope this helped you with your gaming skills on The Escapists. if you have any questions please comment on this comment. and have a great day!"

It's challenging, with the easiest prison taking me a while to escape; although I imagine it's all about the luck of your items. The recent addition of being able to name your fellow inmates and superiors is quite enjoyable, however I'd like to see the devs take it one step further with being able to write backstories for the prisoners. I have also got two other save files on the most medium prison and the hardest, and I personally feel that if you have a tough time on the easiest prison, you'll have almost no chance escaping the hardest. The Escapists is a lovely, well thought out original game offering hours of fun, frustration and thinking in order to escape confinement."

Planning out your escape is not easy, for you will be bombarded with obstacles such as, mines, walls, and my least favorite, ROCKS. Getting the basics is simple, friend your cellmates, buy materials, craft, craft, craft, break a wall down, hide the tracks, etc. Guards will get angered and in later prisons, way more easily. About a rough 25% consisted of me being chased by guards and then dying over and over. Yet thats the reason I love this game. Because all of the suffering it puts you through, it worth it to see the ""YOU ESCAPED --------,"" screen. I would reccomend this game to anyone who likes a good challenge and is strategic. ;)"

Some of the games items are the raft you can make for the newest prison which although made out of balsa wood instead of the 160 raincoats used to escape Alcatraz is still a referance to the actual escape.

In all seriousness, this game is awesome. It is only in early access, and yes there are bugs and some things that can be tweaked, actually ALOT of things that can be tweaked. (small side note before i forget, the graphics in the screenshots in the store page aren't the actual game graphics, the graphics in game look better). Anyway, this game is about following the prison routine while getting set up for your escape. This may sound boring, following a routine and just occasionally doing stuff to escape? NO! It is way more complicated than that. There is alot of preporation and if you aren't fully ready, they pull a Mass Effect 2 suicide mission finale on your♥♥♥♥♥and you are gonna get CREAMED. Trust me, this game is well worth 10 dollars, and they are also adding a level editor/6 prisons! This should be a freaking amazing game, and it already is atleast a great one. Sure, there are a few cons i have, like sometimes when guards find things are missing, they instantly assume it is you and bust you, or sometimes clicking stuff will not work until you click it a few times (Devs, sometimes clicking on laundry baskets to put clothes in them can lead to, well, it not doing it until a few clicks.)

The nature of what it’s simulating leads to some annoyances and careful handwaves to keep things light, but with both enough space between those moments to feel like I was actually producing my own plan and enough tools that I didn’t just feel like I was looking for a conveniently pre-packaged solution. It’s a clever game that’s not afraid to be challenging, and a very enjoyable puzzle if you don’t mind it also being a touch vague, often repetitive, and happy to quickly get as hard as figuring out an actual prison break.Score83/100"

The game is an incredible experience, full of new surprises to prevent you from escaping! The guards can be relentless, and sometimes you have to fight them for the keys!

If you are looking for a game that is enjoyable, challenging and a bit funny, buy this game! There are many ways of escaping, from digging under the walls to making copies of all the keys and cutting the fence. You can even steal guard outfits and walk outside at night!

There are also mini quests you can do that can earn you some cash, aswell as buying things from other inmates.

I beat up the rest of the guards and tied them up, then the warden opened the main gate for some reason, and I literally walked right out of the door.TL:DR, this is the game you get a bunch of stuff set up for a tactical escape then you just end up beating up all the guards.GR8 game tho."

One little mistake and your entire plan could be gone. It is unforgiving, brutal, rewarding, and a blast. The only things stopping you from creating a crazy prison escape are the guards and your own brain."

The game is fantastic as it stands and I can not wait to see what comes up with next.I cant really say what id like to see in the future but I think the AI could be a little more active ,  by that i mean try to escape too or be a little more violent towards eachotherIi have seen 3 fights in the hours ive played and I am finding them rare if anything but still it is a fair game and is alot of fun and is definetly worth investing in"

,Recommended,298630,14216443,"Posted: 28 January, 2015",all,Martin The Actor,"I've been wanting to get my hands on this game for ages, and it was only early access that put me off. Unfortunately, too many people let Early Access games off easy because they are 'still in development'. My desire overode my common sense though.This is genuinely a good game at it's heart. Unfortunately, it's pretty poorly implemented. Basically, it's unbalanced. The decay on stats is too quick and the grind to get them is too difficult. It feels like the stat decay and grind is there to make an already difficult game even more difficult.The basic premise of trying to escape prison is great and the crafting and schedule mechanics actually help to make this a really great game. You can seriously spend ages over your escape plan. You can explore and take your time making an escape plan that won't fail, or you can rush through and choose a risky strategy. That is a fantastic idea. Unfortunately, the stat problem I mention earlier is the real hinderance. I don't think I would mind the button mashing if it weren't for how quickly stats decay, if they decayed at a slower pace then you'd wouldn't mind the constant mashing and grinding to get the stats up.The final criticism is that there is no game manual. There's no understanding of how the game works or the more advanced mechanics of the game included in the tutorial. There is a reason that games come with manuals, and if you're selling the game for actual money, there's no excuse not to include one.So buy this game, with the expectation that you'll need to do some Googling to find some information and you'll have to grind to a stupid level in order to raise your stats and keep them raised.It is a good game though. It can be slow paced and relaxed, but it can also be adrenaline fueled madness. It's good fun overall despite is significant negatives."

,Recommended,298630,12617265,"Posted: 24 October, 2014",all,dande313,"It's a good, $10 game. It's still very under construction, but it updates regularly and the developers give their investors an active role in the development of the game. It can both be difficult at the beginning (a lot of trial and error) and also pretty simple. Once you understand how to escape, it's all pretty straightforward and easy to get out. Quite simply, most methods involve waiting outside until dark, and then cutting through the fence during roll call. There are a few bugs (ex. keys and instructions that don't apply to the map), but mostly balancing work is all that needs to be done. They're also making progress with integrating new weapons and items you can use, although they need some balancing as well. This game is definitely one of the few alpha-beta games I'd recommend buying before the final release."

,Recommended,298630,12058645,"Posted: 10 September, 2014",all,Whap XI,"Not perfect but still good fun. Some manner of tutorial wouldn't hurt, and there's a few mechanics that need work, or else more explanation.A couple of examples: I was late getting to my job one day, and having to walk from the canteen to the workshop is quite a way, and every single guard passed gives +10% heat as they all tell me to get a move on. Like, thanks guys, I'm only on the way already. If you pass more than ten guards, or less if you're been particularly rambunctious lately, then they're going to send your♥♥♥♥♥♥to the infirmary for your lateness.Another thing, I was checking out the hole-digging mechanic by entering another inmate's cell and digging a small hole, hoping to get him in trouble rather than me. Nobody was around and my heat was 0%. Next morning I am immediately teleported to solitary, because the guards knew it was me somehow.As well as that, the routine can get boring. I understand that the slog of a prison routine is a core part of the of game's feel, but after two weeks it starts to lack engagement. You end up just grinding to keep your skills up as close to 100 as possible, and to get as much money from doing favours that don't involve having to attack guards. Again, some tutorial would be nice here about how to progress, so as to avoid the monotony, but that's more related to the availability of crafting notes, upon which I will elaborate now.Crafting Notes are quite rare, and seemingly more likely to teach you how to make a whip out of razorblades and rope as they are to teach you how to make shovels and pickaxes and shivs. Therefore your progress towards actually escaping is limited only by how often it is that Crafting Notes randomly generate in your fellow prisoners' inventories for you to buy or steal. Also it's possible to get the same recipe more than once. It would be nice if it were made impossible to get the same note twice, or else if it told you the name of the item it teaches you to craft before buying it, rather than it being a lucky dip. I'd be less inclined to fork out for a Crafting Note if I knew it was going to teach me how to make the goddamn whip again. I googled it and there are dozens of crafting recipes. I shouldn't be getting a repeat Note when I only know 8 recipes yet. Another thing, recipes you discover independently aren't saved in your journal.It may seem like I'm being very negative, but I'm of the school of thought that a game review should contain everything wrong with the game, with the assumption that everything else is good. These are my gripes. Other than them, the game is great. It feels good and it looks good. It's worth the asking price, for sure. A very original game, and honestly it feels more complete in Early Access that many other games do at Launch. I have high hopes for how this game turns out."

Probably not worth the money.Update:Okay seems most people didn't appreciate my review because it was brief. I didn't like this game because of a few things.Most importantly because it didn't generate much emotion in me over the course of time I played.There is no tension to the combat or trying to escape because theres really no consequence to getting knocked out or the equivalent of 'dying' in other games. You get sent to the infirmary with full health instantly after 'dying', you lose your items but its not like it even matters because you can usually find them again within 5 minutes, no consequences for your lack of effort.You get a series of objectives throughout the game most of which are probably randomly generated and therefore pretty dull. It ranges from, distract a guard at X time, or knock out X character and grab an item from him or, a fetch quest, get me X item, repeat ad nauseam.You follow a prison routine throughout the game so you can potentially have a 'job' within the game, you start out cleaning dirty laundry, but can upgrade to a woodshop or a metalshop. Essentially more boring repetitive quests, move here, grab laundry, stick it in washing machines and then stick it in the clean bin. It's not fun in real life and its not fun here. Most of the time it amounted to me meeting the quota then just sitting still waiting for the timer to run out until I could leave.Often times you'll just get killed by cheap shots from a guard with a sniper in the yard and instantly sent to the infirmary, sometimes it's not really clear why you got shot and its nearly instant, but again theres almost no consequence to that happening.The combat is just click on a person and wait, if you have a good enough weapon and strength, you win. Which brings me to the stats. You have three stats you can level up. Strength, speed, and intelligence. Strength gives you more health and I assume more damage, speed is yeah, and intelligence lets you craft more items as well as get the other jobs. The issue I have with these is more boring uninspired repetition. To build strength you mash Q and E incessantly for a VERY long time to level up, to build speed, guess what, mash Q and E incessantly for a VERY long time, to level up intelligence, you click on a bookshelf about 100 times over and over and over, once again ad nauseam.Overall I did have some fun with this game but overall the pacing felt really jarring to me, there's no consequences for your actions, you have to do a large list of repetitive tasks and it just felt like a lackluster experience overall, there's a LOT of games on steam and I honestly feel your money could be spent better elsewhere."

It has a frustrating mechanic where you have to read, run on the treadmill, and pump iron to improve your stats (which degrade slowly over time). Seems like a cool mechanic until you have to constantly spend time doing it every day, it's quite monotonous, not something I look for in a video game. Furthermore, the sandbox nature of the game is cool, but expect to spend lots of time looking up recipes to figure out how to craft. My biggest frustration with this game is that it somehow, even on the easiest of settings, prevents you from furthering your advancement in the game. Every time I try and dig, open a vent, or anything else, you WILL get caught, receive a letter from the warden, and be sent to solitary, even if there are no guards nearby.Save yourself the wasted time and money looking for enjoyment in this game and just don't buy it."

Whenever you begin to make a breakout, or beat up a guard or do anything that could be seen as fun, the game almost immedietly stops you right in your tracks and says, ""No, some guy way off screen noticed something was amiss, so you lose"". This ruins the whole prison breakout feel and makes it so that if you try anything at all, it has to be all in one quick sweep. There's no extensive planning or worth to building up characters or making friends with other inmates or ANYTHING! I tried chipping the wall away from inside my cell at night, placed the fake wall back, beat up a guard to take his outfit, was about to sneak out via another chipped wall i had worked down earlier to throw a rope over the wall and escape. Guess what happened? Some guy noticed I wasn't in my cell, so the game said ""♥♥♥♥ you"" and threw me into solitary and took ALL my items. WTF?! There was no chase, there was no fight, there was nothing i could do but sit there and start over. Now, if the guards started chasing you or there were some cool searchlights or something, then it would be a very intense moment where they throw the prison into lockdown and everyone starts freaking out whil you scramble to make your getaway.But no, the game doesn't want to have cool moments like that. The game wants you to waste an hour of your time building up your character and completing favors and crafting items and everything that makes this game cool, to just throw it all away without giving you a chance.Presentation 10/10Innovation 10/10Game Logic 0/10♥♥♥♥.

Did I also mention there's weapons too.Third, Each Prison map have it's own routine, When you wake up in your first day at prison, you'll be standing in a roll call, eat breakfast and maybe do some work afterwards and soon when it get past 9PM, roll call and it's time to go to sleep, this is pretty much your everyday life (getting older & older) Don't forget, in some point of the game, you have to find a way to escape.Fourth, Jobs as in Careers which you have to do to get money (doing task for inmates gives you money too, of course) There's Laundry, Kitchen, Janitor, Gardener, Metalsho, etc.  If you don't complete your Job Quota in time, you'll be fired but there's always a second chance :) [Very Soon, I'll be making a Job Guide for this game so stay tuned if you interested]Fifth, uhh....what else?...hmm I guess Escaping, Once you ready by getting the gear you want it's time to escape, there's a couple ways to escape, you can do the 'Prison Takeover' Method or Sneaking out however it can be tough so be prepared (watch out for snipers)& That's my Review of The Escapist, It's a fun game to get you busy for a while and I recommend you should try8.5/10 Would Drop the Soap Again"

And still do.- But it's just so bloody difficult for me LOL.- Idk if I'm just dumb or the crafting system isn't very intuitive at all. I probably lack creativity hahaha.- Where's the fun in constantly having to look up crafting guides online? Would appreciate it if possible crafting items were prompted depending on what I have in my inventory.- If the only other way (besides your brains/trial and error) is by using the payphone for tips then the game gets repetitive extremely quickly when you go through the prison daily routine over and over just to farm for cash.- Too much RNG. I'm not praying to RNGesus.- KBM control seems like a mess. Apparently it's fine on consoles so probably full controller support would be so much better.

The main concept of escaping from prison (apologies for the spoiler) gets old after hour 2 or 3 then you will have to fold more laundry.Unless actual prison life appeals to you you should probably skip this game or just steal it instead and get the real deal.Especially not for $17.99 US current price.

I was waiting for this game for a long time and it's first game out of approx 200 in my lib i got REALLY frustrated with. That's why:1. Totally agree with review below. That game is repetitive as hell. Mash QE, throw items around. Quest and everything gets boring in 5 game days. And it's main things you do in the game. Work for escape takes like 1/10 game time. Rest of it you mash QE.2. No clues for recipes and many items don't work the way they should and this is unforgivable coz there is no animations and it's pixel game. It's all about interactions.3. No ""sound"" in the game... in prison escaping game guards don't hear nothin.Beeing good agruments those are u can live with and even have fun. The thing that really frustrated me is:-Two things happen at nighttime - they search ur cell and they check if u are in your cell. If one of those happens they don't initiate lockdown, they don't look for you, no. White message box just appears on screen and you are magically in solitary... At that time you can be anywhere: underground, hiding, in the closet, impersonating a guard, whatever. White message box still finds you and sets you back. I mean escape ends at the moment they know you are not in your cell... REALLY? The moment all the fun and chasing and looking for you should begin they just return you to QE mashing with a  message box... REALLY???2/10"

All of them seem to be written on an older version of the game, where escaping is actually fun.It's not all bad, I do like the crafting system. The stat system and schedule work fine. It's when you actually start trying to escape that things fall apart. The tower guards have line of site everywhere, which is both unrealistic and frustrating in a way that just isn't fun. Instantly being sent to solitary in certain situations is the same way. Both these things severly limit what you're capable of doing. The tutorial is also kind of pointless, and barely shows you anything about the game. There should at least be something to explain the controls and the basics.Right now, I don't feel the game is worth it's price tag, and I'm not sure I'd even suggest it on sale.

After collecting every key and exploring every room.  I concluded there was no way to dig, or cut fences in private.  GOOGLED: You just cut the fence...  ♥♥♥♥ING HELL!I paid $4.49 for this game on 75% off sale.  My biggest gripe is the huge grind, WTF..  I can't enjoy this game unless there is a mod to skip the hours and hours of grinding for nothing...=================================================================8/05/2017, Well just got two thumbs down because #1) This game is designed to be grindy with no fun, and #2) You're surprised guards shot you in a CONFIRMED BUG, while cutting the fence..߷ Meme Lord ߷ 2 hours ago  DeleteWell, the grind is the point of the game. You can't just escape a prison in 1 hour.There are about 6 prisons in the base game, and 6 in the DLC.  How long should it take?  I think it took me 8 hours after exploring every corner of the map for not cutting the fence type escapes.  I googled the solution, and that is the only ""normal"" way of escaping.  I think the only other alternative is to kill/capture every guard in existence.^^Also Meme-Lord doesn't even own the game...  must be trolling.Sheer Breenius 3 hours ago  Deleteso you're surprised guards shot you when you started cutting a fence? nice^^as of now Sheer has purchased the game, but still has 0 hours played.========================================================8/30/2017, I just wanted to add a final note.  If you look at my profile, I've played about 39 hours (most of it while afk, or watching TV grinding for the boring STR/???/INT) and completed achievements between 8/4 and 8/7/2017.  I have completed about 4 of the 6 prisons, but completely find it pointless to grind any more.  My biggest gripe is still the necessety to grind STR, ???, and INT everyday.  Another gripe is the total randomness of items, and no way to speed up time.  Basically, you'd be forced to play (I mean grind) for 1-3 hours, waiting for specific items to show up.I don't have faith in the system to magicaly have smarter ways to escape in maps 5 and 6.  I think the ""HARD"" setting just means more grinding.At least I got this game for under $10, this game is definitely NOT worth full price.  I believe a bunch of popular youtubers got The Escapists 2 for free (and most were PAID to support it), because they would never have paid a penny for this game."

,Not Recommended,298630,34427460,Posted: 22 August,all,TheFrosted1,"The Escapists is at heart redundant and, to be blunt, pretty boring.  The tasks that lead up to your ultimate goal of escape is so similar from prison to prison.  You have to wisen up as you reach prisons with higher security, yet somehow it doesn't help with its repetitiveness.  A daily prison day has a strict schedule, and allows very little fluctuation in day to day activities to plan your escape.  You may have a ball with the first or second prison, but it quickly deteriorates into something that truely feels that its not worth completing.Team 17 has really oversaturated this whole ""Escapists"" franchise (Can I really call it that?).  I believe ""milking a dead cow"" is the best way to put it.  I was originally considering purchasing The Escapists 2, but I've read plenty of poor reviews to learn that its unplayable in its current condition.But this is a review for the first one, so I suppose I should stick to the topic. I haven't said much positivity in this review.  I should get to that.The workshop is pretty neat.  You can always try other players' prisons, and if you're feeling ambitious, construct one yourself.  The graphics are also pleasantly retro, and the same can be said for the music.In conclusion, The Escapists includes plenty of fun, 8-bit graphics and musi. The gameplay is challenging enough, but not really enjoyable, but that's only one person's opinion, so maybe you will enjoy it."

The game is very reliant on RNG for deciding what items appear, which means you'll spend a lot of time waiting for the right items to appear to stea/buy to craft whatever you need. It also highly encourages you to follow the same routine every day (which I wouldn't mind as much if it wasn't pure button mashing).In some instances the game will instantly teleport you to solitary confinement for certain behaviours which is pretty frustrating considering you'll lose most of your crafted items in your inventory. This wouldn't be as bad if the saves you can load back to didn't all start at the beginning of the day (meaning you have to repeat the daily routine all over again)."

Its a nicely put together title in the 8-bit format, and it reacts as you would expect in terms of interface. But the issue here is with the gameplay which is the main focus for 8-bit format titles. The instant bust is a killer in terms of your trial and error attempts to escape. The main issue being where you hide your contraband  in that any point you are busted doing anything escape like your entire cell and stash is taken.hiding stash in vent shafts can work but you need a ton of fake vents on hand as there is no warning when they will and at a night you then have no chance to fix it and again lose all your stuff.Let alone snipers picking you off in the middle of the cell block and keys being traced back to you?!?!Some of the failings (and this is on the first level mind!) are just too tough to get around especially when learning the game. The issue that you can only save at night (when you want to put your plans in action) means to save you need to wait a whole other day then try again. Why not just add a quick save and let people play and try to beat the game!?Anyway its an alright title but with some major frustrations that once you lose a days play there isn't enough in the game to make me go back and keep repeating it - and on that front for the money i can't recommend it.,.."

OkGive a decent tutorial FFS, I like watching Lps, but can I understand the mechanics without wasting 50hrs first. And thats exactly why they do it, because its a 2 hr high if you understood how it works from the beginning.Crafting is not crafting. Its just getting picks and shovels. Always picks and shovels and cutters and a uniform and some key. No creativity whatsoever in escaping. Theres nothing great about escaping in a raft if its the only way, They really expect you to make it outside and then realise you messed up and restart, wow, fun much.Just like Im supposed to knock out every guard until I have the right key.They bust you for the stupidest reasons but I can replace all the walls with posters.Trying to click on a moving target, the random inventory changes, the amount of useless items, the lack of useful items...Cmon, its not a finished game. All these Indie jerkoffs are worse than Indian scammers, they work on some core mechanic, idea, and then it goes "" so comitted to this game guys, updates comin guys, hearing your suggestions guys"".You, and others are the reason i wont give these pre releases any chance anymore. You dirty people get the opportunity to make some money off of an unfinished product and then you proudly release a dead fetus.

It literally has an escape mode which is nearly this good even though it's a building game. That's right. A building sim has a bonus mode that is better than this entire game.This game has 0 replayability. Is extremely slow. Has a boring and overused artstyle and is also very overpriced for the amount of content in the game.The guards are also psychic. For example. If you forget to put a fake vent cover over a vent you will lose 90% of your progress since the guards will immediately find every single stache in the prison and empty them. Reseal every wall. Every piece of flooring. The guards also somehow immediately know it's you. They don't even need to check fingerprints to find out it's you.Not to mention. The game is extremely grindy and is 90% luck. You will often need to grind stats and materials which can take days if you aren't lucky.

Almost anything you do gets you beaten by a guard, which takes away all the good items you've managed to stuff into your 6 slot inventory AND lowers your stats (there's only three but they take forever to level up).  Item availability is solely at the whim of the RNG and it takes forever for new items to be available to steal or buy.  Overall, a very accurate simulation of prison life: Boring, boring, senseless violence, boring, sleep.  Wash, rinse, repeat.  Even on sale, this game's not worth it."

Among the 34 states in January 1861, seven Southern slave states individually declared their secession from the U.S. and formed the Confederate States of America. War broke out in April 1861 when they attacked a U.S. fortress, Fort Sumter, and ended with the surrender of all the Confederate armies in spring 1865.The Confederacy, colloquially known as the South, grew to include eleven states; it claimed two more states and several western territories. The Confederacy was never diplomatically recognized by any foreign country. The states that remained loyal including border states where slavery was legal, were known as the Union or the North. The war had its origin in the factious issue of slavery, especially the extension of slavery into the western territories. Four years of intense combat left 750,000 soldiers dead, and destroyed much of the South's infrastructure. The Confederacy collapsed and slavery was abolished in the entire country. The Reconstruction Era (1863–1877) overlapped and followed the war, with its fitful process of restoring national unity, strengthening the national government, and guaranteeing civil rights to the freed slaves."

The first are the noodles themselves: rice stick noodles, which are pale, translucent, flat and range from very thin to more than a quarter-inch wide. Unlike semolina pasta, rice stick noodles don’t need to be boiled; instead, you soak them in hot water until they’re tender. Meanwhile, make a sauce from tamarind paste, now easily found in supermarkets. The paste, made from the pulp of the tamarind pod, is very sour, but more complex than citrus.

Crowbars against vents did nothing, files against locks did nothing, and so on.  I know you're supposed to craft items - lots of missed opportunities there.

I can't do that when I'm going to bed and I wake to hear the guards have somehow broken into my cell, and searched by desk. HOW?!Secondly, the combat is very unsatisfying and clunky. It's obnoxious that the game doesn't explain the space bar is combat MODE, not engage in combat...very unhelpful and led to a lot of unintentional punching.Thirdly, guards shouldn't be able to notice doors are unlocked instantaneously.

That's and outrageous price point and most certainly not worth that price.I mean for 5 more dollars, you could get Saints Row IV which is 20$. During the Winter sale from when I am writing this, Saints Row was actually cheaper and I regret not getting that with my money.There are various amazing games for 15$ and around that, but i don't believe that this deserves the price.If you don't want to read my rather lengthy reasons as to why I don't like the game, heres a TL;DR list for you.Pros:-Solid Core Idea-Multiple options for escape-Fairly sandboxy experience-Glitchs and Bugs seem to be non-existantCons:-The combat is iffy as it's not easy to judge a victor from a battle-High Difficulty curve-Difficult Crafting System-Fullscreen mode may not be possibleMy rating:6/10 It's got a nice idea but theres many things that aren't great that therefore doesn't justify the price pointMy long explanation:For starters, the difficulty curve is insane. From the tutorial to (what should be) the easiest level in the game, the difficulty is insane and I was streaming to an audience of 9 who just happened to join my stream on steam, and none of us could figure out what to do, most of these viewers apparently owned the game too!Secondly, the crafting system needs some work, as unless you have a wiki open with all the crafting recipes, you won't be able to craft at least 75% of the items in the game unless you just happen to find a crafting recipe in the prison, but from what i've seen, thats extremely rare.Third, Combat is a little wonky as the enemy's health bar is very small under their feet so it's a little hard to judge whether or not you can win the fight you're inFourth, this could honestly be me being stupid, but from what i've been told, Fullscreen mode is possible, but i havent been able to figure it out :/All in all, the game would be acceptable if the price were lowered to around 5$ - 7$ as that seems reasonable for what we have at the moment. But even then, no, I don't recommend the game, unless you reaaaaaaally want a challenge."

It consists of action, strategy and simulation. The interaction and conversations with other prisoners are witty and enjoyable. HOWEVER, this game prevents you from winning, not for making it more challenging, but for it needs a lot of work.--- First, I've played many games that require the player to ""craft"". (among which the most exceptional one is Atelier Elie by GUST, an old RPG classis with elements of alchemy, fighting, adventure and romance. It appears to be silly but is surprisingly addicting and sophisticated.) But the crafting feature here is not intuitive. The only way for a player to know how to craft an item without reading cheats or walkthroughs (which kills all the fun) is to buy/steal a recipe from other prisoners. The recipes don't come up as often as they should, which makes it really hard for beginners. The crafting system does not reveal any hint, and although makes sense from time to time, is usually illogical. (ex. combining three pieces of dental floss yield you a cutting floss?!)--- Secondly, the user interface is not yet complete. There are very few instructions on how to interact with other characters in the game and how to use your items. A cutting floss is not something I'd know how to use from my life experience. You can't break a wall with a hammer, either.  You can't throw things away on the floor, nor can't you rearrange your inventory. The most absurd thing is when I flush the same item in another prisoner's toilet, it doesn't clog it, whereas when I did it in my own, my room was flooded. The frustration is real, and if you are having troubles like this, just go ahead and check out the discussion board.--- Lastly, the game pace is too slow. For a strategic game, I would not expect to actually need to exercise my fingers in order to gain more strength for my character, and I would not expect to do laundry like a robot, either. I understand the need for a semi-simulation game to be realistic, yet while the game itself is made with an 8-bit graphic style, there should be other ways for us to experience a prisoner's life.The game will be suitable for people who enjoys repetitive actions and unreasonable difficulty, but for me, it lacks of depth and loses its charm by going too far to become an action game. I'd really enjoy it much more if the game challenges my intelligence, as opposed to challenging my patience. For a game that charges me 15 dollars (which is as much as I paid for The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim on sell), the amount of sophistication and efforts put into it is absolutely not worth it."

I do not recommend buying this game until it is actually released.Pros:This game is really fun. Several different difficulty modes, many items to discover and collect.Cons:There are so many glitches. It doesn't save correctly. One game keeps reverting me back to day 19 and even after I sleep and save, after i close and reenter the game, it goes back to day 19. The guards really don't notice much. The game is really easy to just cruise through, no matter the difficulty mode because unless you walk past the guard, they copletely disregard you.Overall, this game could use a lot of work and it has a lot of potential, but at this phase, I would not recommend you buying this game."

I am tired of these shallow massed produced indie games being♥♥♥♥♥♥out now getting all of the attention  that they do. Like really you want to tell me what this 6 bit top down game offers the player other than a couple hours of boredom and  regret. Games like this sacrifice everything thats actually entertaining in video games like good combat , an interesting environment, well thought out level design, interesting characters and plot and good blood and gore for god sakes and for what? Just imagine this game being an intense first person stealth action game.  I actually think this game has a good concept but its potential being wasted on a boring top down 6 bit game that has you spamming left mouse mouse button to level up your strength, doing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t chores all day for money and trying to figure out what components you need to build a rope  and hang yourself instead of actually escaping just pisses me off. 10/10 because im a sheep who buys mindless pixel games becuase IGN told me to.My response to PyroX701------------------------------------Another pixel game hipster comes to the defence of his game. well although your response was entertaining to read it did not make a whole lot of sense. Lets go through it step by step shall we? First of all you state that i think intense first person stealth action games are easy to make which i never said by the way. Right off the bat it sounds like your trying to make excuses for why the game came out garbage by saying somthing like that. "" you think it is easy to make"" ... its as if your saying, ""hey come on they tried best guys so its whatever piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥they came out with is fine"". The next part of that sentence where you tell me to make a better game then them is just childish.  Yah sure buddy at your request i will devote the next 20 years of my life  single handedly developing a stealth action shooter. The second sentence is quite funny as well. You say, ""if you buy mindless pixel games then why do you have a problem with the graphics. Well just to let you know buddy becuase obviously the sarcasm flew way over your head , the statement  that i buy mindless pixel games was a joke. Next you attempt debunk some of my reasons for this game being a tedious waste. You just mainly state that the game doesn't need any of the features i mention. You are correct technically a game doesn't need good graphics , combat , plot , characters, level design or blood and gore to be a fun entertaining game, but if you do not have any of these key features in your game you better have other elements  that make up for it. This game fails to produce anything of worth to make up for its failure on other ends. Lastly i would like to respond to the statement , "" the level design is actually good."" hahahha really come on man reach into that tiny pixelated brain of yours and pull yourself back to reality the map is a small box with a ventilation system that goes around a small box."

This gave me an amazing idea, review more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ indie games. The escapists is a game about routine. Your day will start with you waking up and then getting yelled at by some gaurds at roll call. After roll call you have breakfast and then get to your job. Your job consists of clicking on a dirty laundry hamper, then clicking on three washing machines, followed by clicking on the clean laundry hamper 3 times. Repeat this 3 more times and you'll meet your quota and can spend the rest of your work period improving your stats. After work is free time which is used to complete jobs for other prisoners or increase your stats. Jobs from your fellow cinvicts will either consist of you retrieving something, beating up a specific prisoner or gaurd,  or causing a distraction. The only jobs you end up taking is causing distractions because its the easiest. basically to cause a distraction you just have to punch a random person at a certain time of day. To increase your stats you either click on a bokshelf to increase your intelligence, or mash the q and e buttons on a treadmill or bench press to increase your speed or strength. As you can imagine this is extremely tiring and annoying and chances are you'll spend most of your time in the library. After free time is lunch followed by mid day rollcall then workout time. After workout time you get showers where some of the best quips in the game take place. After showers is free time followed by evening roll call then lights out. But then you get to do the same thing again tommorow and the day after and the day after ect. Enventually you'll have a good amount of money and some tool schematics. So you can start buying objects from certain inmates to combine them together in the games own narrow logic to create tools that break relativly quickly. Lastly is the combat. Combat consists of of pressing spacebar then clicking on your enemy. Usually whoever spent more time mashing q and e or discovered that combining a sock and bar of soap gives you a weapon will win. Unless that person is you. No matter how high you get your stats you seem to always lose. I might recomend this game if they added more prisons, more character customization, and amped up the pace a bunch. If you're looking for a fun game, look somwhere else. If you want to know what prison feels like, look no further."

The best part about it is that you can actually use common sense for pretty much everything, from crafting, to solving all these little issues you'll come across.Is it repetitive? Oh yeah it is. Is it a bad thing? Not really. Prison life *is* repetitive. And that's actually what makes this game rewarding. Learn the routine, make some cash, buy components, make some tools, build your plan to perfection and execute it on your final day.The game is unforgiving, just like it should be. If you don't cover your tracks, you'll get caught, and it's gonna cost you.One of my favourite strategy game of all time."

Not bad for endless amount of game play. They added a map editor means you and other people can make prisons and upload them to the work shop. still lucked based but there are a lot of ways to escape a prison. The game alone has 8 prisons 6 being main ones, 4 DLC ones you have to pay extra for. All and all I would recommend this game just a few things they need to add. Multiplayer, Yes I said it. Doing an escape just 2-4 players would be good. Doing a riot would need the whole prison lets be honest these prisons are low on inmates. Next characters. being able to make your ownn characters. For those who nevered played the game listen up. You need ducktape for everything, picks, shovels, cutters, armor Make something else than ducktape.  like ripping up inmate outfits or using somthing.

It's pretty unique, and the graphics and art style are great and colorful. The pros to this game is it's interesting so you keep playing, the crafting is decent, jobs, lunch, tool, all good. My main problem is a big one.This kinda works like, you escape, then you stop playing. Why? Because it's hard. Well, no. It's not hard really, it's just extremely difficult to work our how to escape. I spent a while trying to figure out how to escape, then I actually had to look it up online to beat it. This was the easiest level.It's awesome, the way to game works. But the fact you have to be a mastermind to get out of the prison makes me want to beat one prison, then leave it alone, save a few more hours in the next month. It's bad, because if they made this game a little more... I don't want to say easier, because that sounds whiny, but I need it to be easier to figure out how to escape.Overall, 7/10Buy it on sale."

,Recommended,298630,12022203,"Posted: 8 September, 2014",all,Shikadi Commander,"So far, not so bad. A ways to go, methinks.It's clearly not finished, but what they have here so far is pretty good. I still haven't managed to escape from the prison, mostly due to a few bugs, but also because it's more challenging than it's cute appearence would have you think. You can increase your Strength, Speed, and Intelligence by working out or reading, however your stats slowly decrease over time. For an OCD type such as me, this is very frustrating, although it does keep you busy. You must follow the prison life routines pretty closely to keep the guards from being on your case, but the only one you mustn't skip is rollcall. Doing so causes a Lockdown and in 99 seconds you are sent to Solitary Confinement, wasting several days and causing your stats to go down. Also, any contraband in your desk seems to be taken away. Contraband will regularly be removed from desks of the prisoner's the guards announce at every rollcall, so you must get there early to hear if you need to move your stuff to someone else's desk. The names they call seem to be at random.You are able to craft together seemingly items to aid in your escape (sock+soap=sock mace, etc.) I quite like this mechanic, as you have to be sneaky and crafty (ha) to continue with your escape plan. It's not very obvious what you need to combine together, however. There are Crafting Notes you can buy or steal from other inmates, or find them around the prison. The problem with this is you are able to recieve the same note over and over again. I already know how to craft a Prison Guard Outfit (seemingly useless, by the way, as wearing it gets you 99% Guard attention immediately and persists until you take it off), yet every note I buy or find seems to be for the Guard Uniform, or something else I already know about, instead of anything useful, such as the pickaxe.The bugs I have encountered so far include items being overwritten with other less useful items when kept in someone else's desk, and the floor under my desk being bugged so I can't dig or interact with it anymore. The latter occurred after I had been caught tunneling, and they had filled in my hole. I went to re-dig it, and was able to get it to 100% , however no hole animation/graphic appeared, it's just a blank floor tile.  I can't do anything with it, so I am forced to dig in the middle of my cell, with my desk covering it in the middle of the room. It seems to happen at random. Luckily, the guards don't seem to care WHERE you place your desk, as long as there are no visible holes. The other major bug I encountered: I don't know how it happened, but somehow I had glitched the guard meter to constantly increase to 99%, even after being sent to the infirmary. They came in and beat me in my sleep, I'd respawn in the bed next to it, and they'd immediately turn around and beat me again. I had to re-load to fix this. Some other problems occur, but they are minor in comparison; such as my tunnel bracings randomly vanishing from the tunnel and prisoner dialogue suddenly cutting off (for example, a prisoner says ""Say my na"", presumably means to say ""Say my name."")Plenty of references are hidden in the dialogue, including a couple from Breaking Bad and Shawshank Redemption, add that to the prisoners and guards occasionally being silly (""Someone's been tampering with the Warden's hat"") there's enough to make you at least smile.There could be a bit more direction about what to do with certain items, and a few kinks to work out, but overall, a fun and unique experience, and considering the game is still in Alpha, it's pretty damn good. There's apparantly only the one prison available for now, but it provides for plenty of gameplay (provided you don't just google how to make everything and how to use it, which I so far have resisted doing). Well worth the $10, considering Team 17's track record, as well as how fun the game is, even in its unfinished state."

This is a great game but the only problem with the game i have met is exscaping. It is hard to get the things you need to exscape, for example going through the vents no problem getting up but safts i have no idea what to do there.2. I like the jobs how its ballanced. Like laundry is the easiest and get less money while metal shop is longer and has a larger money reward for finishing, favours however arent very ballanced some are quite easy or hard, the ones when you need to beat sombody up isint very easy. Most people have wepons and their stats are high and beating up gaurds isint easy, you need to get them to a spot were no other police are around and try beat them up. The ""distract"" one isint hard, all you do is punch a gaurd and you get money, right there is a money farm.3. To me skills are very ballanced, probaly the most of all, i like it when you become more strong more intel you lose intel stakes strength ( i havent done running yet). For skills i feel like its the most ballanced part of the gameIn conclusion this is a great game. Good use of $10.00. I recommend you thinking before you buy it though."

No running from the guards, no fighting for your freedom.You. Cell. Done.Getting found in the vents results in immediate solitary. Again, no chance to fight or flee. Automatic lockup.This is a common occurence, and should be corrected.Tower guards can shoot you from pretty much any point outside, regardless of your distance from them. They see you no matter what, even in the dark.Other inmates dont't take advantage of daily activities or situations; no one riots.No one moves specific contraband related to their jobs, they just have random assortments from time to time.I havent seen any traffic from the outside at all either. No guard change. No food delivery. No prisoner transfers.I did see the warden walking around once. You can't interact with him at all.You can't verbally interact with the guards. They have nothing to say to you. Nothing to trade.Realistically, they would want to make deals and trade contraband in exchange for favors too.Altogether, I played 26 in-game days on the easiest level, equating to roughly 5 hours of real time, and got absolutely no where. Any time I came close to having something that even resembled a plan, immediate solitary confinement.Not winnable. Not fun."

Second, I got it for cheaper than it is now while it is on a 66% off sale. And third, it was more suceptible to bugs. The bugs make this game so much more humorous (most of the time at least). One time, I was talking to a fellow prisoner named Troy. I saw that he had a request, and, wanting to earn money, I checked it out. It turned out that he wanted me to steal a book from someone. The person he wanted me to steal from was named Troy. There's only one person in my prison named Troy. Of course, now that it's out of Early Access, it's getting better. Although, I refuse to play until some form of multiplayer is added (which I and all of the other thousands of players of this game have been waiting for for over a YEAR AND A HALF for it when it was promised since the game was only a KickStarter project!) because I have 6 friends that want to play together.

There's so much potential that they could've worked on.The cellmate quest system could've been reworked, it would've been nice to have more interaction with the other prisoners so you could organize roits or have a barter system with a few guards; stricter pentalities for getting caught; more interesting jobs - that actually help you escape. I don't like how your stats drop down so quickly.It really makes you think and not use the same strategy on each prison. Everytime I dug I'd want to beat my cellmate out for ratting me. If you could pick him up and drop him in the toliet, or tape his mouth shut. All in all I think it's good. But it's still flawed, and hope it'll be fixed up eventually."

76561198082019059,Recommended,298630,13901166,"Posted: 8 January, 2015",all,FiddleFaddle,"I enjoy this game a lot. In fact I have found myself playing it for hours, so lets jump in. The mechanics are great crafting works fantastically, doing work is rewarding yet boring, as you would expect from a prison job, fighting is simple yet fantastic, and movement is what it needs to be. Here are the complaints I have with the game though, I feel like the game needs certain things to balance the game so you are more aware of your surroundings as you would be if you were actually escaping prison; for example there needs to be a feature to look further than the screen will allow you, it doesn't have to be overpowered just needs to be implemented outside. I can't tell you how many times I was walking about to dig a hole to escape at night and get killed by a sniper who I didn't know was there or a guard patrolling that I didn't see in time. I feel more simple sound effects like footsteps, or for the snipers a laser would help me feel like I wasn't cheated in death, but I didn't plan well enough and should have rerouted or hid. Another complaint would be that if you don't have duct tape you can't craft much, and I think this could be resolved by having all inmates sell you things at the cost that they sell you very particular things and this could relate to their jobs; cooks would sell you food, washroom employees will sell guard uniforms, ect. Sidequests are fun and at times when I'm waiting for an item I am either planning or training my escapist to the best of his capability that said I think there should be smaller exp bonuses for doing tasks such as when fighting you gain strength, crafting gains intelegence, and getting away from guards successfully gain speed so when I am doing sidequests I don't lose experience that I could be spending the time surfing the web or excercising. sidequests could also have more depth say the cook was found stealing items and he needs a contraband pouch to continue selling stuff like that. Those are some minor problems that I have had playing the game neverless it is just in alpha, and I can see it improving with every update. This game is fantastic to play and it really makes you feel great planning out daring escapes through different ways. I suggest people get this game now before it gets priced up as it has so much potential to be even better than it already is."

Even though I only played for about 30 hours, I can already garuntee that this game is an amazing game, worth every single penny.  The goal of the game is to escape, and how you escape is up to you.  There are many different ways to escape in the easier layouts, like digging a hole, climbing through the air vents, or simply beating up and tying every guard until the warden unlocks the front door. (trust me its harder than it looks) On the more advanced prison layouts, it limits the creativity on the way you escape the prison.  Even though this does not sound very good for some people, it is better for the players who like a challenging game, and enjoy playing strategy games.  So the Escapists is a game for everyone, like the gamers who like creativity, the players who like strategy, and the gamers who simply want to play for fun."

Cover with at least an inch of cold water. Add a teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until tender (about 20 minutes.2 While the potatoes are cooking, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large sauté pan on medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until tender, about 6 to 10 minutes. If you are including vegetables, add them according to their cooking time. Carrots should be cooked with the onions, because they take as long to cook as the onions do. If you are including peas or corn, add them toward the end of the cooking of the onions, or after the meat starts to cook, as they take very little cooking time.shepherds-pie-1.jpg shepherds-pie-3.jpg4 Add ground beef to the pan with the onions and vegetables. Cook until no longer pink. Season with salt and pepper. Add the worcestershire sauce and beef broth. Bring the broth to a simmer and reduce heat to low. Cook uncovered for 10 minutes, adding more beef broth if necessary to keep the meat from drying out.5 When the potatoes are done cooking (a fork can easily pierce), remove them from the pot and place them in a bowl with the remaining 4 Tbsp of butter. Mash with a fork or potato masher, and season with salt and pepper to taste.shepherds-pie-4.jpg shepherds-pie-5.jpg6 Preheat oven to 400°F. Spread the beef, onions, and vegetables (if using) in an even layer in a large baking dish (8x13 casserole). Spread the mashed potatoes over the top of the ground beef. Rough up the surface of the mashed potatoes with a fork so there are peaks that will get well browned. You can even use a fork to make creative designs in the mashed potatoes.7 Place in a 400°F oven and cook until browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes. If necessary, broil for the last few minutes to help the surface of the mashed potatoes brown.Suggested variations:Put a layer of creamed corn between the ground beef and the mashed potatoes.Sprinkle grated cheddar cheese over the top of the mashed potatoes before baking.Read more:http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/easy_shepherds_pie/#ixzz3gujRatlz"

But these orders would take 30 seconds each to do once the officers call it. This then repeats every single day untill you figure out how to escape.Pros:- Get to upgrade strength and intelligence- play as you would in prison- Get to name every officer and inmate yourselfCons:- Takes ages before you can full on beat up an officer- Have to beat up every single inmate at the prison to find a screwdriver before you can get up into the vents- Lunch time takes 30 seconds as well as gym time and free time"

I've been looking to try out something new and and came across this for $12 and some change yesterday during the Summer Sale.I'm totally hooked! The pixel art style art and animation is very well done. I haven't played many of these retro graphics inspired games aside (Retro City Rampage being the one exception. Love that game!) but I would say the graphics seem to be on par for the genre. I love the variety of ways to accompish various tasks, variety of craft-able items, and the great sense of humor the game has. Loads of fun!And for those of you (what? There might be another one of you out there!) who were thinking about pinking up this game, but then realized that there was no Linux version availible? Fear not!

I haven't even gotten close yet, but I've been caught many times with my vent open, a hole in my floor, or a missing wall that I hid behind a poster after chipping it with a fork.I love fighting the other inmates and the fact that you have to constantly train to maintain a strong character fit for fighting is wonderfulKnowing how to craft many of the necessary items was almost impossible for me to do without the Wiki, but I suppose I didn't do enough trial and error with putting items together.All in all, this game is extrememly fun, has a high replayability value, and is at a very fair price with this sale.

If you want to complete the game, you will really sit down and play this for quite a bit of hours. Prisons are nicely designed, and get harder along the way( the first one is the hardest one to me, seriosuly. The guards are so nice, the stuff they good is so awesome you don't even want to escape that place ).The ultimate goal is to escape, duh, but the ways to get to this goal is more than one. Or two, or three, or four! You can dig a hole, take over the prison, sail away, jump down of the Prison's roof( to get there is also a challenge ). This makes the game sound really nice.And you probably already expect this, here's my critism. You need quite a bit of items to craft the items you need to execute your chosen way of escape, or sometimes, the items you get makes you choose what way of escape you are going to do. Duc-tape for an instance, is really, really, rare. The grinding you need to do to get this is to much. This is a missed oppurtunity, and really takes away alot of the fun. If there was a way to let some 'friend' or connection from the outside to smuggle it in, the game would be more awesome and less boring sometimes.You pay 15 euros for the game( 17 bux or so, I think. Don't quote me on this please ). This is a little much, for what the game is now. If players could create their own prisons, or play together in one the game would be all worth this price. But as it stands, I would advice you to look up this game on youtube. Any good youtuber would cut the dull bits out and the commentary possible with the game is quite entertaining."

This is essentially a prison simulator, and during this time, you are supposed to go to a bunch of different scheduled tasks. During this schedule, you can take side-missions from other inmates, beat up your peers, and play hookie from your mandatory activities. You need to craft items to make your escape, and then, when the time is right, you spring from jail.It's harder than it sounds, but it's pretty fun!It's a nice challenge, and it requires strategic thinking to plan out how and when you are going to gather materials & money, and how and when you are going to use those materials to gtfo.Given that this game is in early access, and I'm enjoying it this much, I highly recommend a purchase.I bought this game for less than $10 and I would say its worth $15-$20, even in it's current build.Cons: it can be repetitive, and punishing. become familiar with saving at the end of each day (automatically by going to bed), and plan to do risky things in the morning, in case you ♥♥♥♥ up big time, because if you get caught, you can lose all your♥♥♥♥♥♥and you repeat a daunting task of doing it all over again.

It is pretty much impossible to figure out by yourself how to play this game, unless you look for help online for most of the basic core features. For something that's supposed to be a puzzle game, shouldn't that be where the fun comes from?I for one find it ridiculous to be forced into looking on a wiki while playing, just so I can do a tedious grind for a chance to be able to do what I just read about. There were so many ways to avoid this (at the very least a little bit) and make this more interesting, but it's pretty obvious that the devs really didn't even try. The tutorial and the useless hints system just aren't enough.Anyway, I'm sure it's fun for a lot of people, but this feels more like a skeleton of a game that should still be in early access. 15e for this with additional paid DLC for this feels like a ripoff to me.

Only reason I don't give it an 8 or 8.5let me tell you a couple of stories.story 1- I find myself several in game days in. I have learned the basics of the game, found possible escape routes, and have made alliances with some of the other prisoners. I find myself enjoying the day to day activities so much  that I almost forgot I was supposed to be escaping. So I formulate a plan and put it in to action. I spend the next couple of days stealing plastic knives from the kitchen during meal times. I work in the laundry room so I steal a guard uniform during my shift one day. Then, little by little in my free time I hop up onto the desk in my cell and begin hacking away at the vent grate above me. It takes a couple of days but i eventually break through at night after lockup and find that there are grates all in the vent system i will also need to hack away so I reformulate. Fast forward several days. I now have fashioned a paper mache fake vent to cover up the busted one in my cell during the day so I am not caught. During my free time I climb inside and hack away, slowly breaking my way to freedom. I have broken all the grates neccesary and now I just go back to my daily routine. I will escape after lock up tonight. Once the cells are locked I pull myself into the vent and am running on my way to freedom. ""WOW what a fun game"" I think to myself. ""I can't wait to see what the next difficulty level is like!"" ""This game really is awesome."" and then it happens. a message appears on my screen. ""A guard noticed you weren't in your cell. You will be locked up in solitary for a few days to teach you a lesson!"" the screen suddenly refreshes and I see my character waking up in the solitary confinement bed, and the game clock fastforwarde several days. THIS is why i give the game lower score. You can be in the middle of an escape but if they notice something is up than tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ You can't even attempt to continue your escape.story 2- essentially the same thing. I decide maybe I should try to escape by staging a prison takeover(knock out all the guards in a fight) so I begin plotting(working out as much as possible, going to work to earn money to buy a crowbar from another prisoner, going to the computer lab to earn enough intelligence to create a steel plated suit for myself out of metal and duct tape, etc.) after several days of preparation i feel prepared enough to take on every guard. I assault the first one and handle him pretty easily. I search his body and take his key just in case I need it to get out of the door. I go and find the next guard and in the middle of our fight i get a message ""a guard had his key stolen and we have traced it back to you. a few days in solitary should clear this up"" and boom. once again with no warning whatsoever, no chance to continue my FIGHT I see my character wake up in solitary, devoid of all materials i had collected and severely weakened from not being able to work out. This is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that really pisses me off. and exactly why I give the game a less than stellar score. but all anger aside the game really is an extremely fun and interesting game. would rage again"

It is one of my favourite games, and, while I don't play it that much, I always get annoyed at myself for not spending enough time on it. If you have the money, buy this game. Right now. Also, you can replace the music if you would prefer to listen to your own stuff. I personally replaced it with a combination of the Watchdogs, I Am Bread and SAO soundtracks, but that's just me. On an additional side note, some complaints about the graphical design are understandable, as this is a new game, but let's be honest, who expects a 2D escape sim from a small indie dev to come with AAA graphics? I MEAN REALLY. I enjoy the graphical style- it suits the game perfectly and allows it to be tongue-in-cheek without being a total spoof.Finally, get the DLC's. Stop wondering ""Will I enjoy them?"" Yes, if you like the game. Alcatraz is my favourite prison (though I haven't finished HMP Irongate yet), and I would advise you to get that first.Have a nice day!"

Because I love it so much, I am going to tell you a narrative about my friend, Froseph:His name is Froseph Martinez. He was caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, and sentenced to life at the Center Peaks Correctional Facility. He did not intend on staying there that long. Armed with plastic cutlery, he skipped morning roll call and decided to cut the fence. He was promptly shot down. Using the computer room, Froseph looked up The Escapists Crafting Guide, in which he figured out how to make a shovel. 3 days after his first escape attempt, he waits till nighttime before digging a hole. As he started digging, a note from the warden magically appeared in front of his face saying he was caught.THIS is where is lost my patience and rage quitted. This game is unique and creative, but there are just a few problems. But these few problems are very big. My first issue is that it is impossible to escape without looking up the Crafting Guide. I believe the Crafting Notes should be more common, and not just appear once in every blue moon. Also, even when there is not one guard in the vacinity of me, the warden sees everything. I once picked up a key from a knocked out guard, and I got a letter IMMEDIATELY after.I also really really really really cant wait for the ability to make your own prisons. In conclusion, this game is slightly over priced, but after everything it says will happen happens, I would totally say its worth the money"

Being able to escape a prison your own way is fresh and interesting. I enjoy this game a lot. It's definitely got a lot of room for improvement though. Things you think should work often don't. For instance, nobody else is trying to escape. The guards know this somehow. So even if you start digging holes outside of your cell, in a place where everyone can go, then the guards will, if they find the hole, even if you aren't there, trace it back to you without fail. Even if you leave a pile of dirt in the hallway, they will trace it back to a hole you dug. It's madness.That aside, I like this game. I have escaped from the two easiest prisons and am working on the third. Hopefully it will be just as enjoyable, though much more challenging."

The low qual graphics makes this game feel like older 90s games which is super nice. The whole prision break theme is great as well. Love the crafting mechanics and how many possibilitys to escape each prision. 10/10
,Recommended,298630,14455645,"Posted: 13 February, 2015",all,Prjct_Chaos,"10/10I understand that there is going to be a lot added, but here are some suggestions:Multiplayer (Being Added)Create a Prison (Also being added)Some alters in chance of getting items. Yes, I know, there are a hole sh*t ton of items to choose from but near the beginning there should be more people selling more useful items. (Like 3 people selling stuff and those people are selling things like files, duct tape, metal, more like that and then as the game goes on these things get rarer and rarer.I definitely recommend this game, it is a great way to waste time having fun doing tedious tasks for other inmates and devising brilliant plans to escape the prison. Great game overall (though they should get multiplayer out ASAP!)."

Or through the White Gates. Or via taking a hostage and demanding release. But you can systematicly beat up and duct tape the entire prison if you so wish. Thats always fun.

Escaping may be hard but it is certanly an adventure of thinking quick movements and toilets and if you beat all the levels in the escapist move on to the loads of DLC's and if you do those to than download levels from the steam workshop or make your own.

Not worth the money though if you want quantity over quality this is you but rather have quality over quantity? CS:GO is fun. So is Rust and Insurgency. Look them up.

However there are some things that go wrong with this game as well.PRO'S-Offers alot of hours of gameplay-Small download that only takes a couple seconds to download-NO LOADING SCREENS-Custom maps made by other players-Very fun!CON'S-Guards kill you for no reason at times-Mainly a game based on luck and no skill is involved.Overall:It's a great game that I would recommend to anyone (Buy it in a sale).8/10- would escape again
