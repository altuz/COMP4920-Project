Where Shovel Knight is a modern adaptation of a beloved genre, Rock Boshers plainlyisthat genre. And while this may give it a somewhat esoteric nature, there's a lot to love in Tikipod's Victorian, snack-coveting Martian romp.As any fan of that era of videogames will have you know, nostalgia is far too generous, and the 8-bit era was downright, goddamn terrible. However, the very spartan capabilities of these systems are what made the games such a joy to experience, as any able developer could only desperately try to navigate the poor hardware. Whenever you can pull something even mildly decent out of those systems, it's like pulling a rabbit out of a hat. Inexplicable magic!This is the paradigm wherein we encounter Rock Boshers. Tikipod has been zealous in its loyalty to the system limitations of the ZX Spectrum, and has produced a game that would have been an instant classic in the European-loved home computer's heyday. Objectively, the creative design is a real pleasure. The visuals are stylish and well-made, the sound design is a joy to hear, and the (albeit basic) plot and premise are perfectly silly, making Rock Boshers exude charm. The gameplay, however, is much more subjective: itfeelslike an 8-bit game. That's a very much ""take-it-how-you-will"" kind of statement, as I enjoy it and praise Tikipod for succeeding so well in its design, but...I feel that the later parts of the game may provide a greater challenge than some players are interested in taking on. True to form, some parts even feel like they're difficult for the sake of making the overall game last longer (which is exactly how 8-bit games were designed). In this way, the visuals may be deceptively benign to the less initiated audience.That said, I completed the game at around the 4 hour mark, and for perfectionists, I perfected all of the achievements at around 5 hours, so it's a relatively quick and enjoyable turnaround."

However, one based on the graphical limitations of the ZX Spectrum microcomputer is somewhat unusual. I won't bore you with the technical details, but many games on the Spectrum featured graphics that had two colours in an 8*8 pixel square other games were mostly monochrome).  This game takes that style as its inspiration but does not stick to the limitations.  The display is in 'widescreen' and there is no attribute clash.  Huzzah!A twin stick shmup at heart with puzzle elements, this is a fun game. The controls are tight, but 8-way firing with an analogue stick can be a little imprecise but it isn't a game-breaker.  The music is pretty good, with several nods to AY chiptunes (the title tune is reminiscent of Jonathan Dunn's title tune in the Spectrum 128 version ofRoboCop).There a four minigames to unlock which offer differing amounts of fun (your mileage may vary), but are on the whole well executed.  There are leaderboards for these and the main game too.  The game has a surprising amount of variety in its levels and some stages can be moderately difficult.  All told, this is an enjoyable game which builds a lot of fun on its retro foundation.  To paraphrase the blurb on many Codemasters’ cassette games, ""This game is absolutely worth playing!"""

,Recommended,298790,14235140,"Posted: 29 January, 2015",all,Parallax Abstraction,"I also covered this game on my YouTube channel.This is a game for a very specific type of audience. It aims to fully emulate the type of game that was common on 8-bit home computers like the ZX Spectrum but with original content. This can best be described as a multi-level puzzle twin-stick shooter combo with a light story. It's fairly challenging and can be frustrating at times but it does what it sets out to do very well. You've got to be into this kind of game but if you are, you'll love it."

,Recommended,298790,16550042,"Posted: 20 June, 2015",all,Nax_o,Bit conflicted about this game. Sometimes it's just an annoying crowd control shooter game (with added difficulty as you run around 'laps' in certain levels that require that)  and sometimes it's a clever blast from the past action game and a well designed one too.Love the MSX-era look. The 16-bit graphics option that was added in the latest patch is very nice looking too.Unlockable arcade games puts your old arcade skills to test. Loderunner anyone?Check actual gameplay videos to get a better picture of what this game is and skip the stuff on the store page. Store page gives a false impression there are adventure elements in the game. In reality they are non-existent.

76561198153771422,Recommended,298790,26370898,"Posted: 2 November, 2016",all,DOCTOREROCK,"A lot of people needlessly get hung up, for better or for worse, on the genre or the category of a game. On the other hand, some games get hung up in the same way. You end up with misguided critics, and major studio titles that feel disjointed, forced, or have major elements ""slapped on"". Rock Boshers, however, is *purely* a fantastic game.The style, the feel, the sophistication, the polish, the awe, the humor, and the challenge soar with such harmony and finesse. Rock boshers is an engrossing and ecstatic experience. This is the real deal. Bravo and Brava."

,Recommended,298790,16709415,"Posted: 25 June, 2015",all,MansterSoft,"I'd first like to say that I absolutely love the original Rock Boshers. It is definitely one of my favorite Indie Games, if not my favorite. It captures all of the asethetics of ZX gaming to its fullest beauty, provides interesting and creative gameplay, a good chunk of difficulty (I still haven't beaten it after all of these years), and some light humor. I always assumed development of the game would go no where and it would fade into obscurity. Being remembered as merely a demake like Gang Garrison.Man was I ever overjoyed when I discovered that DX existed! I haven't played it long yet, but it's definitely better than the original (which is a must-get already). Here's my breakdown...-Graphics: Fantastic. It's difficult to work with such a minimal sprite resolution, but Dugan does it masterfully. I was worried that the graphics were updated when I saw the screenshots, but you can choose between Console Mode and Old Computer mode, so no worries. Very faithful to the ZX aesthetic.-Sound: Just fine. Nothing repetitive or annoying.-Music: The soundtrack is great. Though I'm personally pretty disappointed that the original old-school sounding soundtrack is not an option. It really added to the atmosphere.Gameplay: I haven't gotten far yet, but the controls are tight, and I assume the difficulty will get as hard (if not harder) than the original. Which is really hard.If you like old school, minimal, or just plain unique games; do yourself a favor and buy this.Edit: Aw, what the hell? PS4 players get 4 Player Local Battle!? Why is that not included in the PC version? The game is an homage to old COMPUTER games and the developers leave out features for the COMPUTER release. How disappointing!"

It plays like the early games from that system, a wee bit like 'treasure island'. Whether you'll dig it comes down to the level of nostalgic you have for these kind of games. Personally the developer Tikipod Ltd can't do wrong with me, he/she isn't paying me to say this either. I just really enjoy playing Tikipods games e.g. Aqua Kitty. Now I wonder if I can plant the seed of them doing a 'Dizzy' game for us that no longer have a speccy.10/10 would enjoy a tape loader again"
