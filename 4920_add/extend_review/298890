,Recommended,298890,14009615,"Posted: 16 January, 2015",all,Neo NiGHTS ®,"It's one of those games where Steam should have a ""Yes. With Reservations"".TL;DR:If ALL these three itens happen, you can grab this game:1) Like Zelda;2) Like Adventure Time:3) Can get this for, AT MOST, $15,00 (I'd say $10,00 is better).And a final hint: SAVE OFTEN! This game has a tendency to randomly crash while entering different locations (and a Loading Screen appears).Not so TL;DR:Before buying this game I'd read some reviews stating how much Zelda like this game is. For me, this was a plus, since I like Zelda. However, what I failed to understand is that this game IS NOT ""Zelda like game"". It IS a ZELDA game with Adventure Time theme and skins over it!All your Zelda stuff is here:- Boomerang;- Bombs;- Ziplock bags that work as the pots;- Fairies to replenish your health;- Money growing from grass;- A 999 limit for your money;- Useless shops;- Piece of hearts;- A shield;- A hammer;- Upgrades for some of your weapons;- Annoying puzzles;- Nice bosses (although only three);- Same map layout;- Death by bad hitbox.The only couple of things missing from Zelda are:- Bow & Arrow;- A way to move faster from place to place (a teleport, a bird, an ocarina etc.).And all the good stuff from Adventure Time is here as well. All the characters (even though just some minor appearences, like to give you a quest or an item), original voices from the show, nice humour.As a game, well.... it's like going back to the 90's which isn't bad per se. What IS bad is paying about $30~$35,00 (I don't know actually the price in Dollars since it's not my currency) for a game from the 90's. It could've added some nice improvements on the formula, like adding the possibility to make notes on the World Map so you wouldn't get lost so easily. Because there are a lot of places you have to visit later after you get a certain upgrade, but then you have to remember where it was.Another thing that annoys me a bit is the amount of Loading Screens and how long they take. It's a freakin' 2D game (ok, I know the environment is on cell shading)! Why so many loading screens? It would be better if there was ONE big loading and then the whole game would just flow.I don't like games where you have to travel a lot going back and forth and then they throw so many loading screens.So, in the end, I don't regret buying this game because I got it on Holiday Sale for 50%..., I like Zelda and like AT. But if I were expecting something more from the game, then I'd be very deeply disappointed. So you have to be very aware of what you are buying."

76561198037669978,Recommended,298890,23382664,"Posted: 4 June, 2016",all,Vaenis,"It would be hard to describe this game without pointing at any top down Zelda like because it has every aspect of the kind. Though where games like Ittle dew would be more puzzle focus, this one is more about action and collectibles.Basically you control Finn, who's been sent by PB to investigate the royal governance shenanigans of the nameless kingdom. But as you arrive, you realise that you have to find back a bunch of princesses by beating dungeons and bad guys.You will quickly be left on an overworld map to explore and will find a lot of minigames hut with some challenges to complete, caves to wander, stuff to collect and merchants to trade with. All of that will be populated with a lot of characters from the show, all having their little catch phrase that will steal a smile from you, as they all have concerns and, eventually, side tasks to offer in their own personnal ways.But worry not, for Jake is here to support you, and will take the role of a Shield or a couple of other 'handy' tools like a grab or a slap to pick up items, hit enemis or interract with switches to unlock parts of certain dungeons.Just like any other zelda, Finn's progression will be tied to the items and collectibles he will get through the game.You will have a set of hearts to symbolize your lifepoints, that can be upgraded by collecting heart quarters, a sword and an inventory that will soon fill up with a lot of consumable items you can bind to buttons to use during the game.Some of them will be like, bombs that can breach through walls, a boomerang to stun enemies and bring items back at you, a grapling of some sort, plastic bags that serve as bottle to keep items you can grab... You have a gauntlet and keys and boss keys, dungeons maps to find, chests, compasses... Well, the usual you expect from a top down Zelda game.Truth is, while it clearly uses all of the codes from that type of games, some of the mecanics, while not being necessarly fresh like the grab or gauntlet, will be cleverly used in each dungeons and path that you unlock later on. Every key items gained leads to new places you'll be able to access and so on.There's also tint of derision and self awareness in certain aspect of the game, like when you can throw items to a fairy pool to upgrade them and decide to throw Jake. Or the way some npcs will conveniently notice that they are just doing the regular tropes of that kind of games. All in all it gives a nice feeling of things being fun and, sometimes downright silly, just like the early seasons of the show. Though, if you expect some sort of lore building, revelations or plot twist of the actual serie, you won't find anything here for the plot is more a pretext to justify the exploration gameplay.Technically, it runs okay on a regular computer (with a few fps drops on a few zones), though it is clearly calibrated to play with a controler. So screw your mouse and keyboard.Some of the mecanics works well, you won't be unfairly stuck because some items refuses to work the way it was intended to be, at least. Only exception, i'd say, would be Jake's shield; for i realised that it was kind of hard to use in tense situations and not so much efficient. To be more precise, you have to hold LT to raise it in the direction you are facing, but you can't rotate your character afterward, which makes blocking tough since you have to face the projectiles and raise. A setting like in Zelda 3, where the shield was passive and triggered while facing the right direction, would have worked better.Or like, if you were able to reorientate Finn or just, move slowly when shield is raised so i can have more control over it.The top down camera in 3D background with 2D characters, projectiles and enemies makes certain actions or situations hard to gauge, perform or dodge too. It happens that you get hit by a bullet or an AoE while thinking you were out of range or, like, under an enemy when actually not.You will also encounter a bunch of crashes on the overworld here and there, especially on the north west zones past the second dungeon, for some reasons. So i'd recommand to save your game often.So... Is the game worth playing ? Well, if you like the show and top down RPGs, i'd say yes. The lore is pretty well rendered, there is a lot of references to episodes of the serie everywhere, either being items or backgrounds, npcs or quests. A bunch of secrets to find, an item delivery side quest that is comon to every zelda, dungeons are okay and the end is kind of fun, actually.Every npcs you'll encounter will be voice acted by the actual actors from the show (except for Treetrunk, which is really, really sad !). It's well enough written to excuse some unpolished stability here and there. But the core mecanic already made its proof so you won't be badly surprised.Though you have to keep in mind that the game is short, like, really short. I spent 10 hours to complete everything, from storyline to hidden items. If you rush it you can probably finish it in only 4 or 5."

It's very similar to zelda a link to the past and has a very good old game vibe. The atmosphere and music also go very well together. While there is some difficulty in navigation some enjoy the challenge of finding their own way through the maze of a map and if all else fails take out the old pen and paper and start sketching your own personal map. The controls are solid once you figure them out which I recommend you look up the pc controls if you don't have a controller. That is one thing I find quite annoying which is the lack of button prompts for computer and no way to find them out Intuitively. As for the Adventure time theme I loved fighting through the enemies and talking to the npc's recalling all the episodes they were from and all the nostalgia that came with that.Overall I recommend this game for anyone and if you're a fan of Adventure time as I am then it's a must buy."

If you're looking at this game I'll assume you're already a fan of Adventure Time. This game does not dissapoint with the fan service, it uses voice actors from the actual show and is full of jokes and references to several episodes. The gameplay itself reminds me of The Legend of Zelda a Link To The Past for the SNES, but in the Adventure Time universe. It's a really well done Zelda esque game with a good cast of characters and nice humor.If you like the show or you like old Zelda games, this ones for you."

Now that I beatened this game, I can safely say I don't really care for it.The game itself though, is really actually good. Very obviously Link To The Past inspired, even making some sound effects similar to the game. Same top-down combat with an overworld and dungeons.The dungeons are great, they're large with good puzzles copied from LTTP and some new ones. There's only 4 dungeons, but due to how large they are (They take about an hour, possibly more), you won't be disappointed. The bosses are good too, one of the non-copycat felt like it would've fit right into a Zelda game with how creative it was.One iffy thing about this game is the overworld. It's closer to the original Legend of Zelda than LTTP, so you might be spending a lot of TIME on your ADVENTURE just to figure out how to go to the next dungeons. Some people like that, it's not so bad. Most of the time it's not too much of a chore exploring everywhere, but putting stairs underneath a bush that isn't exactly obvious is kind of annoying.Recommend this game to top-down Zelda fans. Wayforward, to no one's surprise, are clearly zelda fans and great developers. As for Adventure Time fans, the lack of dialogue and interactions with characters may not make you like it as much as you hope, but you'll definitely see characters from the show and some new ones with voice acting.Crashed 5 times on me and there's no autosaves. Never crashed in a dungeon (which can be to  hour long, so thank god), but still consider saving often if you do plan on playing it."

There are lots of other little callbacks to Zelda, some specifically designed to mess with a Zelda player's expectations. But a game like this can't be carried on references alone, and despite being a licensed game its quite adequate.With this game Wayforward delivers dungeons that could fit right into a Zelda game, with an aesthetic change. These are the highlights of the experience - these dungeons avoid the simple, linear layouts of the worst Zelda dungeons (and of many bad Zelda clones). However, there is a distinct lack of difficult puzzles (though I imagine this has to do with being a licensed game for a cartoon).The dungeons may be pretty good, but that's just part of the game, and the rest of the game isn't as interesting. Its not that the Overworld lacks things to do, but so many of those things are just collection sidequests, like Kinstone Pieces or Secret Seashells from the Zelda games. Almost everything else to do in the overworld is required by the story. And the overworld itself is just kind of boring. Its small and it lacks a sense of scale or grandeur. You climb no mountains, swim in no lakes, and traverse no deserts. The overworld is effectively just four variants of ""forest area"".There are other issues besides the overworld. There's a lack of story. The story and writing that's there is geared toward Adventure Time fans as far as I can tell. The game has a tendency to crash during loading screens. And really there's just a lack of interesting ideas in the game. It goes a bit too far in trying to be a tribute and ends up doing nothing unique of its own.Do I recommend this game?Probably not. Its not that its really bad, its just that there are other similar games that you could be playing instead.If you have a Nintendo console and there's any Zelda you haven't yet completed, that's probably more worth your time.If you don't and need a Zelda fix, you could try a better and more unique Zelda clone like Oceanhorn, Anodyne, Darksiders, or Shantae and the Pirate's CurseReally I'd only recommend this game if you've already played all those games or if you're a fan of the show.

Well I would love to but the GUI is stuck showing me ""press LT"" and there are no actual settings to turn this off!!I'd say save your money and wait until a fan of the show to make a decent game seen how WayForward let us down, but at least they'll sleep soundly on top of our $40 right?"

Of Course I didn't have High expectations for the game, but it was good enough to catch my attention. I would only recommened this game to AV fans LOZ fans."

76561198004948036,Recommended,298890,24056133,"Posted: 3 July, 2016",all,BeefSteakSpike,No beating around the bush this game draws many parallels with the Zelda franchise in both design and overall feel. If this is somehow off putting or if Zelda styled games just isn't your thing then there is't much to get from this. However the game is great for what it is and knows how to pull off what it's trying to accomplish.I personally found the game very enjoyable both in game feel and the feeling of being part of the Adventure Time world. it's  also a game where hunting down achievements isn't too difficult if you like completing games a 100%In short the game is good for what it is and therefor recommended.  Especially if you are a fan of Adventure Time and The Legend Of Zelda.

,Recommended,298890,20161312,"Posted: 31 December, 2015",all,a lizard,"This game... is pretty fun. But it does have it's share of problems. Some of the temple puzzles DO drag out a bit too long and the lack of the ability to actually carry bombs without farming out a certain type of enemy is annoying. But honestly, them basically making a game in the same vein of A Link to the Past is a good move. Adventure Time always strikes me as the kind of show that if they had a game, it would share some of the same themes as Zelda. If they ever make another game of this style and add a bit of polish to it, I think they'd have something pretty dang good."

You get to see a lot of familiar faces from the show as well (obviously).  The music is ok, a big improvement from the music of Why'd You Steal Our Garbage.  Final verdict: If you are a fan of Adventure Time, and are considering buying this game, just purchase it.  There is no harm, it's only like three dollars.  But it is a good game, and you will probably enjoy it."
