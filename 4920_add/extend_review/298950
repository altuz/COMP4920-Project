And I think they're great, this one especially. The graphics aren't that great, kind of on par with early Frictional stuff (think Penumbra) and the gameplay is great if you're an adventure fan. The puzzles can be awesome, or sometimes baffling, the voice work is not great, but fits the vibe, and the atmosphere is fantastic. Also, after having played so many bad first person horror games lately, this one was a breath of fresh air. If you liked Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth and are down for something a bit more lonesome, and focused on puzzles instead of action, you'll dig. If you're a graphics-snob who gets bored or frustrated easily, stay away."

The story and atmosphere are still satisfying but...This sequel is different from the first game in that it now requires WASD to walk around. So if you appreciated the laziness of point-and-click in Darkness Within 1, you will not find it here. In fact the game itself does not include any kind of mouse-only layout.Now here comes the universally frustrating part: The Steam version of this game is different. They switched the clues and puzzle solutions around, and no one has put together a walkthrough to cover it. You will only find solutions in the Steam forums. The saddest part is that some of the solutions are illogical and you will probably NEED a walkthrough. So enjoy that little hitch. I'll try to post some clues here and in the forums.**POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD**Below the Old House:The ""container for liquids"" and the means of opening the closet are now in the underground gallery beneath the Old House.The contents of the metal box in the underground gallery: You will need them to get through the padlocked door in the underground gallery beneath the Old House.

I, however, think these games are thee best lovecraftian games of all time!The game itself is beautiful, the voice acting some of the best I've ever experienced and the soundtrack is haunting, yet beautiful.One of the things I like so much in these games, is that you don't get every detail served. I remember playing it the first time, and rushed to the end, but I was left with so many unanswered questions. The second time, however, I tried to keep note of everything I read, and the game was suddenly so much better.This is the series, I personally, would love a new game of the most. A 3rd one would be great! Or at least a game in the Darkness Within universe!Word of advice: Play the first game first! I've read somewhere in a review some years ago, that the second game can be played by itself, but for your own enjoyments sake, don't do it. You will lose so much information, and chilling experiences.Lovecraft would be proud!"

I was unfortunately disappointed. I don't mind that the graphics aren't impressive, since it's an old game and it does get the story across just fine, but the story is the biggest problem. It's full of Lovecraftian horror cliches, loose plot threads, bad story pacing and hardly makes use of the previous game's story or events at all.I get the feeling that the game really wanted to be a classic Lovecraft-style horror tale set in the 1930s, but kept forgetting it's established in 2011. The first time we see an indication of a modern day environment is when we see a box of discarded VHS tapes in the bookstore, but it ends up being the only one. Howard has misplaced his cellphone sometime between the two games, and the newest-model phone we see is a broken 60s variant. There's not one television in sight, let alone a computer. Even the few (nonfunctional) light switches we see are early 20th century. The only car we see (and actually get to use) is a 30s style fordor that belonged to Howard's grandfather - gone is the small but modern car from the first game. Every NPC talks like they stepped out of a turn-of-the-century novel, fear of ""strangers"" is rampant, everyone talks about curses and ""rites"" even though in the next breath they insist they don't actually believe any of that, oh no, but let me tell you in detail and purple prose about all these curses anyway. And who writes diary entries that come with cliffhangers for events that will take place weeks or months later!?Almost all of the referred-to NPCs from the previous game are killed off somewhere behind the stage before the game even begins. We never find out what became of Howard's police friend, Arthur. We spend a good quarter of the game making a mysterious machine work at the bottom of an abandoned building, but besides one scrawled note, we get no results or consequences from it. We don't know who the robbers' employer was, nor do we know what was in the sewer. I understand that part of horror is fear of the unknown, but that's no excuse for sloppy storytelling!This game does have superior sound design, and the full 3d environment is more comfortable to play in than the Myst-like static backgrounds, compared to the previous game. But as a whole, DW: In Pursuit of Loath Nolder is much better than this one."
76561197970840537,Recommended,298950,18474876,"Posted: 14 October, 2015",all,infin,"Unfortunately, DW2 takes a step down in quality compared to its predecessor -- this, I suspect, is largely due to the switch away from Scratches-esque point-and-click style to a fully 3d engine.  Everything just looks and feels a little wonky (and occasionally buggy).  Worst of all, the world is too soft around the edges and lacking in detail compared to DW1... I just didn't feel as immersed in the environments despite the increased freedom to explore.  This lack of visual subtlety seemingly leads to a similar lack of subtlely in the story and characters (e.g. in DW1, Howard is understandably shocked by every strange thing that occurs; in DW2, Howard is carryinga living homunculus in his pocket for most of the game and barely bats an eyelid).  And while the inclusion of more characters in the world was ambitious, the more prominently featured conversation system is clumsy at best and occasionally broken.DW2 does do one thing more effectively than the first outing:  the flow of the game and its puzzles seemed much smoother and more intuitive... I never felt stuck simply because I had no idea what Howard was supposed to be trying to do (as sometimes happened to me in DW1).If you played and enjoyed Darkness Within 1, I can recommend Darkness Within 2 simply by virtue of the resolution it (sort of) provides to the storyline and the healthy dose of Lovecraftiness.  If you haven't played or didn't enjoy DW1, however, you should consider avoiding DW2."

I highly recommend this game and its predecessor.But, to be completely fair, it's not quite as good as the story it finishes.   This slight drop in quality is simply a result of it showing the player too much.  Arguably, the secret to nailing a proper Lovecraftian vibe is to keep all the important things endlessly in the shadows.  This game breaks that rule, and takes you right to the center of everything.Still, that's a very minor sin here, especially since the story had to go SOMEWHERE.(Eccentric side note: the game looks amazing on a 3D monitor once you turn off a few of the new graphics settings.)All in all, I highly recommend this game unless you haven't played the first one yet.  But if that's the case, I just recommend the first one even harder."
,Not Recommended,298950,30327312,Posted: 4 March,all,Yaya,"Darkness Within 2: The Dark Lineage is a disappointment. Not just in the sense that it’s not as good as Darkness Within 1: In Pursuit Of Loath Nolder, but also in that it actively squanders the potential of the first game, and is mechanically inferior.The biggest change is that DW2 is a 3D exploration game rather than a point and click game. The player has full control over protagonist Howard Loreid. He can freely walk, run, jump, crouch, and manipulate certain movable objects. That all sounds fine and dandy, but it’s apparent quite early into the game how little these changes add to the experience. Howard can explore locations freely, but the locations themselves often feel as small as, or smaller than the areas of the 1st game, only you can interact with them now. You mostly deal in closed spaces and isolated rooms. The village you arrive at early in the game is little more than a small town square with few enterable locations, all quite short and insignificant. There are some larger areas you gain access to later on, but you are either unable to fully explore them, or it is monotonous and pointless to do so. This isn’t helped by the fact that the Howard’s “running” speed feels like walking, his walking speed feels like crawling, and if you have run toggled on, it toggles off anytime you enter a separately loaded area. I am no point and click purist, I’ve probably played less than 10 games of the genre, but DW2’s decision to go 3D feels fully unnecessary and detrimental. I don’t know if it was an attempt to reach wider audience, or perhaps achieve greater immersion. If it was the latter, then it was an absolute failure because…Jumping is a buggy mess. I thought I was just incredibly unlucky when I fell through the floor 30 minutes into the game, but then it just kept happening again, again, and again. Step 1: start walking into any wall/door/obstacle. Step 2: Jump. Step 3: Continue holding down the walk button. Repeat a few times if necessary. Congrats, you are now able to clip through about 95% of the game. This clipping almost exclusively ends in you falling out of the map, into oblivion. There are a few instances where it can give you access to rooms prior to when you’re meant to access them, but this never provides any advantage. Even if we set aside how utterly broken jumping is, I don’t think you’re actuallyrequiredto jump at all in the game? There are a few points where it might be more convenient to do so rather than moving some furniture out of the way, but all in all, jumping is wholly bugged and superfluous. Crouching is slightly less buggy and slightly more useful, but not by much. You can clip through some walls by walking into them while crouching, but it’s not as ubiquitous as with jumping. Some clues/objects can only be found/examined while crouching, which I guess is moderately realistic, but crouching to find a clue never made me go “Yep, this makes abandoning the point and click genre worth it”. Object manipulation is similarly useless. Howard must occasionally move something out of the way in a room, but most of the time the objects serve no purpose and only get in the way. It’s also pretty ridiculous how having to drag a chair out of the way is slow and tedious, but said chair can be sent flying across the room if you jump into it at a certain angle.The more puzzly parts of DW2 are mostly intact. There’s plenty of material to read, but there’s generally less clue underlining and thought combining than the first game. Puzzles are still frequent, but they never intrigued me as much as they did in DW1.You might think that the game having larger focus on exploration would bring you into contact with more people, but that is not the case. There are 5 NPCs you can talk to throughout the game, all hideous, rubbery, quasi-human, and donning yaoi hands. The conversations are nothing but exposition, and when you have multiple dialogue options, you’re expected to exhaust them in the order they’re presented, or else there’s a good chance they won’t make sense. There are a handful of background/bystander NPCs in the town, but they only serve to make you feel more alone. They don’t even have any canned dialogue responses. You can shine a flashlight at and jump on a sleeping train station hobo without consequences. Most of DW1’s conversations took place over the phone, and human interactions were rare. Though where the world of DW1 felt isolated, the world DW2 feels empty.Aiming for more immersion may have been attempted with good intentions, but those intentions are all for nothing when you’re falling through the map every 5 minutes, exploring sparse locations, and talking to lifeless NPCs.Criticism of DW2’s story is more vague, because DW2’s storyismore vague. DW1’s story wasn’t exactly crystal clear, but DW2 is even guiltier of obfuscating the truth (that’s assuming there is one). I am no stranger to how Lovecraftian stuff works—it would be silly to expect every detail and mystery to be completely explained. Yet the story of DW2 feels so… unfulfilling? Part of the problem is how disconnected it feels from DW1. None of the locations from DW1 are revisited, most references to it are just in passing, and for spending DW1 “In Pursuit Of Loath Nolder”, Loath Nolder has a noticeably small role in the 2nd game. Whereas DW1 was a game of deduction and getting to the bottom of things, in DW2 it feels like you’re just doing various tasks because you’re told to. There’s the supposed threat of people coming after you and such, but overall the story feels without a purpose. As the title “The Dark Lineage” indicates, this game is primarily about Howard’s connection to these conspiracies and plots. Yet Howard comes off as having less of a personality than the first game. Between the two games, he seems to have completely gotten over his potential insanity (aside from an occasional outburst), which in turn makes things a lot less interesting. Likewise, the nightmare sequences induced by Howard’s madness are almost entirely absent too. For no good reason, and only serving to make things less interesting. Howard has zero personality in NPC conversations; he just asks what he needs to know. He comes out of his shell a little more in the 2nd half of the game when he’s brought into direct confrontation with his past, but ultimately it’s not enough to salvage his character.The dissatisfaction with the story that doesn’t come from the game’s relationship to DW1, comes from the game’s conclusion. Everything that comes afterHoward enters the wellbasically feels like a non sequitur to the rest of the game. Yes, I know it’s supposed to be Lovecraftian and weird, but it comes off as dull, rushed, and nebulous, even taking into account the multiple endings. It is unfulfilling to the story of DW1, and what had been set up in DW2 up to that point. Then there’s some frustratingly unresolved plot points, likethe involvement of the law enforcement from DW1 in the conspiracies, or how halfway through the gameHoward apparently summons a centuries-deceased German alchemist who tucks him into bed, and leaves a note telling him where to go next, before disappearing for the rest of the game??? There’s Lovecraftian storytelling, and then there’s bad storytelling.Even if you really enjoyed DW1, I would recommend staying away from this game. Your questions aren’t going to be answered, and you’ll leave disappointed and frustrated. The only thing I can say that’s of truly equal quality between the two games are their excellent soundtracks. The game’s waxy NPCs and loose understanding of walls may come off as unintentionally Lovecraftian, but overall this game is a thing that should not be."

(i think this game needs a prequel rather than sequel)- there is a low fps problem. i played and finished Darkness Within 2: The Dark Lineage 3 years ago with my old computer but i m still can't play direction cut edition with my newer laptop because of this low fps problem.overall darkness within 1 and 2 great games and i m really proud some turkish game developers can produce original and interesting games such as darkness within series. i ve played several times both of games and when i buy a new computer, i m looking forward to play this direction cut edition ,too."

,Recommended,298950,26036318,"Posted: 14 October, 2016",all,RipWitch,"""Darkness Within 2: The Dark Lineage (Director's Cut Edition)"" brings us back to Howard Loreid after the events of the previous installment. While Darkness Within 1 was narratively set up as a flashback to show Loreid's descent into madness, Darkness Within 2 shows events afterwards. Ditching the point and click to a free roam horror game inspired by Lovecraft's works. While it is not necessary to play Darkness Within 1 (recounting those events early on), it certainly makes you see the ending.Unlike the first, Darkness Within 2 doesn't suffer as much from pacing. Not requiring you to go back and forth to read documents as much (in fact, you're not really required to except in one or two instances). Instead it encourages you to speak with residents of Arkhamend to gain information to progress. It also brings free roam exploration as the focus while puzzles are used to get to important items for the ending. Darkness Within 2 seems to want to engage the player more into the character, and it helps with these changes. It also has an quick save system when pressing 'F5' which is highly appreciated.However, with these changes, there are problems. The voice acting, while some are good, most is flat. There is no difference between the voice used for monologues than when you are actually speaking to someone (at least with the previous game, the voice actor used a hushed tone to distingush between the two). There is no difference between inner monologue than speaking  Some areas have areas where you can fall through the floor. While some are behind areas blocked off, there was one towards the end after a puzzle. Along with this, I do suggest if there will be invisible walls, have them to where the player can't jump over most of them. While subtitles are translated to english, at the end it is not.It also needs to be said that this version has objects moved and some puzzles added (this is not the first version of the game), so there is only a german walkthrough that tells you where those objects are located and how to solve the new puzzles. Darkness Within 2 also gives too much information, not leaving the player to question whether these events truely happened or not.While Darkness Within 2 can be frusturating, it is worth playing.Overall:+ pacing is improved+ sound effects realistic+ more immersion+ quick save system+/- difference between this and other version can cause confusion while looking for a walkthrough+/- objects or hotspot can be too small to see- flat voice acting- bug where you can fall through the map"
