There are a LOT of guns, usually you can dual weild them too!  It's fun to shoot stuff, the animations are great, overall the graphics and 3d models are great.  I love the voice acting and humor.  Most of the levels are well done and look fantastic.  Straight forward linear no BS gameplay, just run n gun and shoot the hell out of ANYTHING and EVERYTHING.  Definitely no Half-Life or Duke 3D or Doom, but definitely fun.  P.S. I used to hate this game too."

Gideon rises and tries to take over the world and kill Caleb while he is finding a way to ressurect his friends called the Chosen, decent story. But on most machines on Windows 8 the game performs horribly! But there is a widescreen fix, but I recommend turning the settings down alot to get a playable experince. Overall I say get it if you can stand bugs and glitches and performance issues. One Unit Whole Blood is a much better deal though."

The game itself is of course very bloody, has nice locations, interesting enemies and awesome dark atmosphere, occult-themed.

Moreover, there are some bugs present in that game from the very beginning (it is not the Steam version problem) that cause game crashes. I also have to redefine some keys every launch. If you encounter 1FPS problem, switch to software rendering engine or browse the community forum for tweaks.On the other hand, I have no problems in launching the game under Windows 10 64-bit (Intel i7, Intel HD Graphics GPU + Nvidia GPU) and Steam always installs all game files correctly for me.DISCLAIMER: If you are 2000+ era and have never heard about the serie, you may simply don't get all the joy we got back then and better skip this title!But if you arereallyinterested in the serie, you may also check Blood I."

Run the game in windows 98 compatibility mode and as administrator (found this info on GOG).OKAY, OKAY I ADMIT IT, I'M BIASED AGAINST THIS GAME. BUT YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY LIKE IT. MAYBE JUST SKIP MY REVIEW AND JUST WATCH SOME GAMEPLAY FOOTAGE lol.http://youtu.be/o3z0spt1RFII played this a game quite a bit years ago i.e. when it first came in 1998. I actually started off with the demo. Yes I did play it today and it still the same I've clocked multiple times so I know the game well. The game is okay but nothing special, it disappointing unfortunately.Okay yes it is sequel to Blood. However I really don't think the game is as good. I think that because of the standard of 3D games at the time i.e. low poly models that sort of thing, making the transition to 3D didn't really benefit the blood series of games. In fact if you don't count 'Nightmare levels' expansion for this. This was the last blood game. And personally I think it that's they tried to do it in 3D to early on. The first game in 2D actually looks better than this. Just compare the first level of game to each. The first Blood had Caleb rising from the  grave in a cool mortuary and traversing through a funeral parlour. Blood II has you walking down the carriages of a train. It cannot get more corridor like and linear, and that level only goes for about one minute if you just run down it. Yes the textures in the first game are pixelly but you actually see the detail such as text clearly. In blood II textures look like a painting whose colours have run because the canvas was soaked in water; everything is a blurred smear. The models in Blood II look so much worse than the 2D sprites in the original game. Compare the Tchernobog 3D model in Blood II you find in the museum to the 2D version you find at the end of Blood. The sprites had so much more detail in them including their animations. I mean blow an enemy up in Blood and you witness them being torn asunder in an animation formed by a series of sprites. But blood II they will just be replaced by the crappy low poly gibs and blurry blood spatters. The first Blood game has so much more detail; finer detail. Environments in that game looked like they had a lot of effort into them. Maybe it in Blood 2 it is not so much that effort wasn't put into the game, more that PCs that people had at the time weren't that powerful so higher detailed 3D models and detailed levels weren't really feasible yet let alone the standard.Even the one liners from Caleb and other player characters are not the same. Yes it sound like Caleb. I think it is actually a different voice actor maybe. But the lines are less black humour and more just sadistic.Anyway it's not all bad. Some of the gun play is actually satisfying, then again some is pretty lame and it's hard to control fine control your character movement. Years ago, not now lol I played the demo over and over again. Using the assault rifle felt pretty good. I'm recommending that people can enjoy this but it's just an inferior substitute for the original game which is also now available on steam. If you have to choose between them play that instead.Clickherefor more let’s play videos =)"
,Recommended,299050,11984367,"Posted: 4 September, 2014",all,NZ Denom,"Blood 2 and the Nightmares Expansion are decent enough to play. It's a classic late 90's shooter (with the no reloading thing and the endless copy paste enemies). All the ideas in this game are cool, it even has some easter eggs.. not many of them are funny but it's a bunch of cool references. Caleb himself is an anti-hero, You could compare him to Alucard From Hellsing, Not caring for common people and is just wants Blood and Vengence. (Personally the repressed, evil insanity thing really appeals to me, even if it's a Protagonist or 'The Good Guy').The ending left room for a Sequel.. as in the Developers would have had the option to if they wanted, It'd be totally okay if they just left things as they are...Oh Yeah, don't complain about the game's realism.. I've read some of the other reviews on here, ""Everything Explodes, even the trash bags!!"" It's a 90's game dude.. Quake 2 was very similar in that way, shoot a dead body with a pistol and it explodes.*Sigh* This game is basically my childhood, I found it when i was 7 in my Mother's computer game rack, and had a blast (lost the CD as the irresponsible child I was).As I've played through on this steam release, the game has ended with a crash, within 20 minutes, 3 times.I bought the game KNOWING FULL WELL that on steam it has this issue (others having the screen flicker problem).I bought this game along with the previous Blood game to support them, as dumb as that sounds, I had the slight hope that they might update the game with at least a small patch, I know that Jace Hall tried to get the first game with HD, re-released for Free, but the ones who own the rights to the franchise were having financial issues, I don't think they were keen on giving away an asset, even though jace would have paid for the HD re-release himself.I hope I at lease supported this game a little.. Even though it was only $4.99.Edit: I recently got Windows 10 and now the steam version of Blood 2 has framerate issues as well as the normal issues, causing the game to slow down every few seconds (even in the main menu) well below 20 frames per second. running in compatability mode does not help."

It is a little of both, with respect to the time it was created. It would not be fair to compare it to current games, of course, but even in comparison to games of the same era it stands back a little. There is no other game I can remember where the opponents arethatstupid. One can hardly call that ""AI"". Even a Pacman ghost has more AI than the Cabalco zombies. Rendered cutscenes are embarrassing at best, and the storyline is more than questionable. On the other hand, the game features nice graphics and effects, and has some funny moments. Somehow, once in a while, playing it again is actually quite fun. But eventually I ""grew"" up with that game and it brings back memories. That is the only reason to replay at all.I certainly would not recommend the game to anyone who isn't already familiar with the Blood gameset. And now for the main reason why I cannot recommend the game at all: it is technically close to unusable.Blood II used to become unstable even back in the old days if you owned a PC ""too powerful"". Apparently the developers have put their engine timing a little on the cheap side, and nothing has been changed about this at all to make it more compatible to current platforms. Actually you will buy the same binaries that were on the original game CD back in 1998! The Steam client does not even have to be running so the binaries obviously literally weren't changed a bit. And you better don't use the Steam client to launch the game at all becuase it is usually not running in an Admin context, so it will not apply compatibility mode which is a mere joke... the game will crash almost instantly.While on some machines (including mine) there is still a chance to get it working (e.g. by setting the compatibility mode to XP SP3 and running the game as Administrator directly from the installation folder), you should anticipate at least one crash in 10 minutes of gameplay at random times, so remember to save frequently...veryfrequently.So this is a really bad strategy for remarketing. I would expect a software provider to do what is necessary to restore compatibility to current hardware before a game goes for sale. If I had known in advance, I could just have used the Blood II CD that I already owned (purchased 1999!).Steam did a nice job getting Duke3D running thanks to excellent DosBox integration. The Blood I package is already a bit screwed up because no link is created to run the setup.exe you need to map keys, set video resolution etc... if you are not familiar with DosBox, you won't get very happy. Seems to me they are just squeezing some dollars out of reminiscent fools like me without actually caring much about the quality delivered. Too bad. So the best experience for these old games is running them on the machine they were built for, if you still have one that works."

,Not Recommended,299050,33950165,Posted: 1 August,all,eS,"Put simply, this game's sale price, one or two weapons and about 2 or 3 levels are its only saving grace. If you can get it to run at all, of course. I'm not the type of person that gives a thumbs down for nothing, so I'll delve a little deeper.Before I go on, a word of warning: this game is wildly unstable and hard to get up-and-running properly. This is also one of the main reasons I gave it a thumbs down, it's just too damn unstable, even with all the patches, fixes and running it at 1366x768 if you have a 16:9 monitor, it's the only resolution that looks good and runs relatively well, anything above 1000px in height crashes every third quickload.But let's say you got it to run, so what are you getting? As far as presentation goes, it's dated, but not entirely garbage. The weapon models are done alright, the character models not so much, but the enemies some of the environments are what stood out to me. The sound design is also pretty good, music is minimal but effective in helping the visuals set a really dark/gloomy atmosphere, the weapons sound really good too. The problem is, they only sound good.The weapons in this game, while cool on paper, are the most puny, unimpactful pieces of trash I've ever seen in an FPS game, which is a shame, because in the original Blood, the enemies were tough, but the guns packed a punch hard enough to balance it out. Here, the vast majority of enemies take A LOT of ammo to kill. For example, there are these bug-like creatures that take 70 assault rifle rounds to kill. EACH. Granted, you can carry 500 rounds, but what the hell does that help if there's 3 of them along with some other (even tougher) enemy types, that maybe take 100 assault rifle rounds and 20 Tesla charges to kill? The Tesla cannon is the only weapon with some semblance of punch, but ammo for it is scarce. The Napalm launcher has been neutered to the point of insignificance. It simply kils nothing. Weak. I don't know if this is a problem with the actual weapon damage or the enemy hitboxes, but the bottom line is that the way the guns and enemies work together SUCKS. The only cool weapon is the Hook thing you get in the Nightmare levels, which spawns portals that shoot out chained hooks that pull the enemy towards said portal; if you spawn enough of them, the sorry sack of meat to end up in its grasp will literally by ripped apart slowly. Cool stuff. Why not more of that and less generic, bulletchomping crud?I think the main problem with this game is simply that it's artificially difficult to the point of ridiculousness; unfair, cheap, and most importantly, not fun, 80% of the time. I'm not new to 90s FPS games (in fact, if you have a quick look at my library, you'll see that it's pretty much the bulk of what I play) and I completed the first Blood, but this game is just... frustrating. Most enemies are (as mentioned) bullet sponges, hit-scanning enemies have an accuracy so high that two of them will get you from 200HP to 34HP in a matter of seconds, hard-hitting projectile enemies are often spawned in small areas with no way to dodge the projectiles or even the splash damage, ammo is distributed poorly, health even more so, the boss battles suck (especially the Nightmare boss) etc. It doesn't click, most of the time is what I'm saying.I could go on and on about this but let me just use the Behemoth enemy type as an example. It's the boss of chapter two. I had to empty 100 sniper bullets and the ENTIRETY of my Tesla cannon to defeat it. In chapter 3, it's a fairly common enemy type, and it's not even one bit weaker, not to mention the game often spawns two at a time. Sure, they infight with other enemies, but you're still wasting massive resources to defeat an enemy which ultimately doesn't even need defeating because you can just run past it. In general, the balance of resources vs. enemies that good FPS titles like DOOM, Quake, Shadow Warrior, Duke Nukem, the first Blood etc. got down to a tee is completely absent here. I literally speedran/skipped upwards of 2/3 of a level because I just couldn't be bothered to stand there and pump hundreds and hundreds of rounds into these tenacious wastes of disk space. Let me illustrate the situation: in the penultimate level, the game spawns three of these large, tough and powerful Lich-like enemies into a narrow-ish corridor. They fire napalm-like fireballs with huge splash damage and you have nowhere to dodge. Hm, should i just... run past and avoid them completely or use up all my hard-earned ammo so that I'm left ammo-less for the sure-to-follow boss encounter?There is a forgettable and rushed story in there somewhere, but the voice acting is bad (even Caleb's voice actor, who is excellent, has some downright cringy moments), the villain is an annoying, pompous tw4t, the Chosen are about the least memorable crew I can think of. The expansion is less than two hours and has the most lazy writing I've seen in a while and the most annoying boss in the entire game (who the hell makes a boss that shoots undodgeable homing projectiles?). The only way I could beat it without cheats is to literally get it stuck in the world geometry and hold LMB until the thing dropped and I had the intense satisfaction of listening to Gideon's disgusting voice narrate the end of this nightmare.That's not to say this game is ALL bad. It has a vibe that really hadn't been done before and honestly hasn't been done since. The controls are great and smooth, as they should be for a 90s FPS, the levels are non-linear and the architecture is, for the most part, well designed (even though some levels like the subway train or Cabalco offices are lazily re-used up to THREE times), and in terms of actual good gameplay; what about the other 20 or so percent that ARE fun? Well, the gore system and gibbing in this game is immensely satisfying, when everything clicks, it's pure 90s FPS mayhem as it should be, but this is sadly so rare that I can just barely state these moments exist.All-in-all, unless you're a die-hard Monolith fan (which I can't blame you, they made much better things than this disappointment) or you find the prospect of bulletsponge enemies and frequent crashing fun, I'm having a hard time recommending this game, even if it does cost 1.5€ during sales. If it ran properly, I'd probably give it a ""barely recommend"" and just caution everyone to be aware of it's questionable design and cheapness, but since it's also a buggy mess, I just can't recommend it."
,Not Recommended,299050,14768414,"Posted: 6 March, 2015",all,Cornish Gamer Hen,"Blood II ReviewBlood II is simply abysmal. Don’t even buy it when discounted. And yes, I have played the game through and multiplayer.Blood 1 was a fantastic 2.5 d shooter, and I had the pleasure of replaying it last year. It still stands up great. Blood II doesn’t live up to its predecessor.I don’t blame Monolith for the quality of this game – it was rushed for a Halloween release date, along with development on Shogo happening simultaneously. It is kind of sad that a lot of promised features weren’t included – this game looked a lot more promising before release. The new patches fix a lot and add some stuff, but it doesn’t really save this game.Cons:Let’s start with the cutscenes. They are unskippable, which is bad because the story is horrible. Cutscenes  start in random places. For example, while Caleb is standing on an escalator, he has a conversation with Gidgeon as the escalator slowly moves him away from Gideon until they are talking to each other through walls, and this is at the very beginning of the game.The voice acting is absolutely HORRIBLE. Seriously. The NPCS are annoying, say very dumb and random things. Caleb has turned from a badass to a weirdo. When lit on fire, he will scream about long after the fire is gone. He will randomly laugh while killing. It seems that the developers also had no idea what voice or accent he should use, as it changes throughout the game.He also randomly asks for the “Pain to go away” or something while he’s taking damage. It’s so weird and out of place that it breaks any immersion, not that you should have any, and it makes you feel all uncomfortable, like you’re playing an angsty teenager and not a hell raising badass.If you’ve ever played Shogo, another game by Monolith, the blood and gibs look roughly the same. However, this really doesn’t fit the serious (I guess? Its hard to tell the tone of this game) tone and realistic art direction of this game, and it fit Shogo being a cartoony shooter. (Unlike Blood II, Shogo is very fun and innovative.)The Life Seed and hearts look the same. What do they do? Whats the difference? I don’t like it when games hold your hand but this is just confusing/lazy. I mean yeah the wiki exists, but still.A lot of the stuff in the environment is destructible. You can destroy washing machines, garbage cans and other junk. This is cool, but a Soda Machine will explode and take half your health. What gives?Levels are linear and lame, and lack the interesting design and just interesting places of Blood 1. Grey and brown falling apart city. Woo. I’d rather play Kingpin if I wanted that.Music. Like Shogo, Blood II attempted adaptive music, music that adjusts to situations. This results in annoying jingles playing randomly and no consistent atmosphere due to transitions between combat and walking stuff.Also, the music is just horrible. Its dischordant garbage and the main menu uses pistol shots as a weird percussive side thing that doesn’t fit with the music.Tacky talking about video games in a video game xD joke is present and very cringeworthywhy does the launch menu have a very loud gunshot noise upon openingThis game doesn’t know if its serious or edgy or funny.Pros:The HUD is actually really nice. The display is easily visible and minimalistic, the oxygen bar underwater is small and fits well, and is easily visible.Transition from combat and back. It doesn’t feel like Quake, but it doesn’t feel like Half Life either.The graphics are actually really cool and nice to look at.  Lithtech rocks.The Blood community is great. Multiplayer is fun.Tech wise, its easy to work with and works great on later machines. I haven’t had any troubles, then again I play older games for fun so it may not be as easy for others.I give it like, a 3 out of 10 at the most. And that’s generous. It’s like eating a tub full of snow logs, but without the rush."

The most galling bug is random termination - go forward, blast away a couple of NPCs, round the next corner and boom! back to the desktop without any explaination whatsoever.Granted this game hasn't been ported towards more recent platforms (not that XP is ""recent"" by any measure of the term) but even trying to launch with any compatibility options enabled results in an unlaunchable game. To recap: random program quits when playing without compatibility, and unable to get beyond the launcher if playing with compatibility enabled.If lith (and/or successors) can fix at least this bug I'll reconsider this review, but that's a fairly big ""if"" at this point."

It has all the finesse of something written by a 13 years old.The level design is bland and feels incomplete. Definitely a step back from the original game.The difficulty is not balanced properly. I played the game in the recommended difficulty, and kept finding myself running out of ammo. The enemies sometimes feel unfairly overpowered, for example one of the most basic enemy unit, a machinegun wielding soldier, can shoot you the first microsecond you enter their field of view, so it's realy hard not to take damage from them. To make matters worse, the game performs poorly on modern systems. I got it to run fairly smoothly and even at a reasonable resolution, but whenever there's dynamic lightning the framerate drops to the point that it's not pleasant to play.Is there something good about this game? Not really. It feels like it could've used another 6 months of development. Unless you're a completionist, skip this game."

Like many reviewers here, Blood II was part of my teenage experience, an unabashed Duke Nukem 3D clone with a slightly improved engine. It was a mistake to go in on this for $2.50. At $10 I would be incensed.If you can get the game to work at all, it's unstable, slow, and looks terrible, even for 1998--no work was done to improve compatibility for modern systems. The launcher gets mad if you don't have DirectX 6 installed.I didn't expect much, but the game itself has aged badly. You control like you're on skates, the level design is dull as dishwater, and there's really nothing to strongly recommend unless you get really excited for what passed for cool in shooters of the late 90's--cartoonish gore and lots and lots of terrible one-liners.

Just be aware of this if you consider buying the game.What I liked about the gameThe game still has that sense of humour the first game had.You can play has four different characters, although I would of liked to of seen the characters abilities when choosing.Awesome boss fights, especially the last one.Some of the weapons were good; like the singularity gun, minigun, and napalm gun.Some of the levels were alright like the human slaughter house and the campus from the expansion pack, but still they had so much more potential.Alright soundtrack.It has some little things that I liked from the first game; like being able to kick severed head and being able to restore your health using people's hearts.Plenty of gore and dismembermentWhat I disliked or was disappointed withBoring levels; which is a shame because the first game had some really memorable levels like; Dark Carnival and Phantom express. Some of the levels I felt were a great idea, but they could of been done better; for example when you stubble into a human slaughter house and the school campus from the expansion pack.Some ugly looking weapons; like the pistol, assault rifle, and flare gun. They have also replaced the pitchfork with a boring looking knife. The weapons don't have much of a kick compared to the first game; I was very disappointed with the explosives, because they weren't as effective as they were in the first game.Too many nuisance enemies (hand, leech, and spider).No cleverly hidden secrets; I remember in the first game you could interact with a piano and a secret hatch would open. I felt the game needed more references to horror films.You can't interact with things (except levers and doors). I remember in the first game you could interact with the mirror and Caleb would say something.Enemies aren't particularly interesting, although the undead monks from the first game make a comeback in the expansion pack, which is pretty cool. Some parts of the levels you will find yourself just running through them, because the later enemies are just bullet sponges and deal a ton of damage; you do it to save ammo.The A.I of the civilians is just terrible.Playing the game on normal, is like playing it on hard.ConclusionVery disappointing; the game feels rushed. Not a patch on the first game, even the games expansion isn't as good as the expansions from the first game; like Cryptic passage or plasma pak. If I were you I would give this game a miss or wait till the game is heavily discounted; it's not worth the hassle. So much potential and so much wasted. After playing Shadow Warrior (2013), wolfenstein new order, and Doom (2016), I think now would be the perfect time to do a remake or a new game for the blood series; Plezzzzzzz.4/10"
