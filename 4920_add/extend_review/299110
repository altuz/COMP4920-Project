76561198138437975,Recommended,299110,15765710,"Posted: 9 May, 2015",all,MirandaKym,"This is a lovely little gem of a game made by the same people who did the 3 Empress of the Deep HOs.Pros:-  The graphics are well done - lots of nice artwork.-  The voice actor for the lead female is, in my opinion, quite good.-  Along with hidden objects and puzzles, a very fun game pops up on a regular basis. You get a picture and, underneath, a number of little spheres with tiny details of the picture. You have to find and click on those details in the picture. Hope you have a good eye. :)-  For HO lovers, there is a large amount of great hidden object scenes. Fun to look at and items are usually easily identifiable while being sneakily hidden. Sometimes I had to search around for a bit but I never had to use the hint button.-  Puzzles range from easy to manageable. There's nothing that should stump you.-  There's a bonus chapter. Though it's very brief, it leads to an artwork gallery.Cons:-  The story is a bit creepy and disturbing. While this may be a pro for many, I'm placing it under cons because the plot is also confusing. I've played this game (and the bonus content) twice and I'm still not sure exactly what happened. :p  Maybe you're smarter than me though.-  Very very short game length.If you find this on sale, I definitely recommend it to all you HO fans. Even though I couldn't wrap my head around the story - the voice acting, artwork, and hidden object scenes were a pure joy."
,Recommended,299110,17746047,"Posted: 27 August, 2015",all,Faudraline,"It's been a while since I played this game, but oddly enough I still remember the setting and the story very well. That, I can say for a select few games in the HOG genre. I remember basically devouring the game within a couple of hours, due to its creepy and intriguing atmosphere, alongside the main character's otherworldly abilities.Theatre of the Absurdis an exceeding game for its genre.We take a close look on Scarlett Frost - god, I wish there would be a series based on this character - , an occult expert who was invited to a remote castle to identify a dangerous occult object known as the Habsburg Cube, which is said to contain a powerful demon. Our employer/mysterious gentleman Dr. Corvus decides to throw a tantrum when Scarlett declares the item as a fake, and smashes the artifact to pieces at the opening scene. Then... yeah, you have guessed right: everything goes to hell, and yeah, the item WAS the real deal.Now Dr. Corvus is possessed by the said demon, and the whole castle has just became his playground. Following Dr. Corvus' last wish, Scarlett takes Bethany - his young and innocent daughter - to the bell tower, the only place that the demon's taint couldn't reach for unknown reasons. Now Bethany's soul is in grave danger, and above all things, Scarlett's right hand is infused with some uncanny, demonic energy which spells full sentences of advice out of nowhere, probably with an agenda of its own. Your immediate task is to wonder within the castle, and discover its many wonders and horrors in hopes of both finding means to protect Bethany and bring an end to this demonic infestation.As I've stated at the beginning of my review, the atmosphere is grand. Every singular animation was a cross breed between Vertigo comics' eerie style with beautifully drawn gothic artwork. I was sold within the first 5 minutes of gameplay, both thanks to the story and the artwork. Voice acting is taken seriously, you can listen Scarlett making a comment on everything. Another charming factor is that the developers were fascinatingly attentive to detail. Considering Dr. Corvus himself was an occultist, all areas that you encounter are weaved with occult, mythological and historical references for your enjoyment. I know that I enjoyed it thoroughly. And the Theatre of the Absurd itself... No, I won't make a comment on that. Lets not spoil the experience for you, shall we?The gameplay is fairly generic for a HOG. It is an adventure with hidden object scenes and puzzles. Nothing new in that department. What was both refreshing and intriguing is checking your arm for instructions and advices, and wonder whether it be in your best interest to follow it or not. Hidden object scenes are not the greatest, and puzzles are nothing extraordinary. It just takes some attention, is all. There is some backtracking, but the game itself is not that long anyhow so it won't bother you much.There is a bonus content at the end to present us some more information about the mysteries within the Theatre of the Absurd, but as a fair warning: the ending is incredibly vague. There are scattered clues indicating Scarlett's relation with this odd family, but nearly nothing is explained. After completing the game, nearly half your questions shall remain unanswered. I'd love a sequel for this game. There is room for the story improvement and mysteries to be enlightened, if there would be future installments. I'll recommend the game based on the incredible setting, and original plot ideas. If you enjoy the HOG genre, or at least enjoy beautiful artwork, here is a sweet present for you.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

Even clicking descriptions, you have to wait for protagonist to finish saying ""I have to put something in there""Story length is short. Finished game in less than 4 hours + 'bonus content' on Expert first timeUI is not intuitive or consistent. Sometimes you drag an inventory item, sometimes you just click, sometimes you click lots for multiple items.. who knows until you have to try!The Ugly:Collector's edition has extra content- they remind you on every screen in there and on your items (serious example: Ruby [Collectors Edition])Story didn't flesh out at all and don't really explain very much. Bonus content only serves to open more holes while badly plugging the ones you had finished with.No extra features - no achievements, no cards, no side quests, no lore, no epilogue (I lie a little, you get to see... concept art after bonus is completed).For people who know their HOG's:This game is probably one of the lowest ranked HOG's I've seen in a long time. There are games in the Apple store for tablets that go for $2 that are better than this. The story is unengaging, short and unpolished; the puzzles either easy or annoying. This is the first time I've felt like skipping easy puzzles because I couldn't be bothered, as there was no motivation nor interest from story to encourage me, let alone some of them were very arduous.The fact you can't skip most of the dialogue in the game, including 'monologues about what to do next' really kills your interest and since you're left with no epilogue or extra features makes you feel like the whole game was a chore with little to show for it. For $A5, you're not getting your money's worth. I would buy it at <$1 sale as it still had beautiful artwork and well, its still a HOG :)For people who are new to HOG's (Hidden Object Games):This is not one of the better ones on the market folks. There are much more fun HOG's on Steam that give you so many extra features that they're now generally accepted as standard including Steam Cards, side quests (e.g. extra hidden objects in different maps), achievements and more. It is especially important to note that this game did not have a very good tutorial nor really orientate you to what you're meant to do so it may not be the best one to start with or base your opinion of HOG's."

If you are looking for a hardcore challenge, though, this one is definitely not for you.Note: This is the Collector's Edition with bonus content. There's an extra mini-story to complete after the main story. However, it didn't offer much extra, and the last puzzle was just ridiculous. It was the only thing I used the strategy guide to get past.Pros:- Detailed artwork. The concept art gets unlocked as bonus content when you complete the game.- Objects are not so hidden that they are impossible to find. Only a few of the objects might be confusing.- Decent variety of different types of puzzles along with the Hidden Object ones.- Puzzles can be solved by an average user. These don't require a savant or prodigy to solve.- Ambient effects and animation keep it from looking like still frames.- Hints and a complete ""Strategy Guide"" (walkthrough) are built-in if you do get stuck.- Sparkles to indicate when something in a location can be interacted with. This is especially helpful with all of the backtracking.Cons:- Somewhat cheesy story and voice acting.- Lots of backtracking and re-use of previous scenes for Hidden Objects during the course of the story.- Use of shadows as objects.- The lighting effects in Hidden Object scenes can make it difficult to see certain objects. Sometimes I had to wait for the light to change in order to see something.- Fixed 4:3 aspect ratio.

Honestly I was expecting another average game as I have played some hidden object games before but wow it proved me wrong! This has to be one of my favorites. The art is great as with most in this genre, but the mood and feel surpasses most. It really draws you in. The soft music actually increases teh spooky part. Normally I don't mention the voice actors, but the woman's voice is well fitting. The story is intresting so far but thin (maybe it changes over the course of the game). Maybe I love this one so much because it is intense and in my favorite style: horror. Yup I love hidden object scenes with death things, weapons and severed limbs..A kewl extra is that at a certain point you come across a room that you can't open. Not untill you finish the main storyline as it holds the bonus contents. How kewl is that?One lesser point on casual the puzzles are too easy. But then is it really negative?"
,Recommended,299110,14689158,"Posted: 28 February, 2015",all,shiaakuma,"Pretty decent puzzle/HO game for five bucks.  There is a decent lot to do, roughly three hours of content including bonus features for the Collector's Edition, which in my experience is pretty standard for this kind of game.The puzzles are not horribly difficult overall, mostly involving collecting and assembling items, but there was enough variation through most of the game that I wasn't bored with it.  The hidden object scenes are detailed, well-drawn, and reasonably challenging; they weren't astronomically difficult, but were well above the difficulty level I normally see in this style of game.  I did not see any issues with click-precision that at least one other reviewer complained of; I had to click ON the objects to collect them and did not notice any severe misalignment.Both the story and the voice acting were decent.  I didn't find myself constantly cringing, which is definitely a plus as I tend to be irrationally bothered by poor voicing.Overall, if you like this style of game, I would recommend giving it a go.  If five bucks is more than you want to pay, hold out for a sale and grab it then.  Either way, I personally thought it was worth it."

Somewhat less cheesy than most, at least until you get to the bonus content after the main game is done. They had some great ideas for the story and details in the locations, and one thing I really liked is that many of the objects in the HOG sections are actually used in the game instead of just being there as something to find at random. I start to feel guilty buying these in bundles because the art takes a lot of time, I'm sure, but then I just keep buying more so maybe it works out. This one stands out, get it!"
,Recommended,299110,17035775,"Posted: 13 July, 2015",all,bagels,"I'm recomending this game even though theres a bug that stops you from being able to complete the game.It's a good hidden object. I liked the graphics, lots of puzzles, good story.Unfortunatly, each puzzle tends to have more then five pieces, which often are seperate objects in your inventory and make it a bit cluttered. So, easy fix, put all the pieces you have onto the puzzle and come back to it when you have the rest, right? The last puzzle with the tablets will get frozen and messed up if you do this, and you won't be able to end the game unless you restart from the beginning.So, I'd recomend it for what it is and absolutely everything else worked fine, just stinks when you can't actually finish a game."

But who plays one-dollar hidden object games for plot anyways?Pros were that it really was fun, and I basically played it for three hours straight because it's kind of addictive.

Artwork was beautiful, story was very interesting and some puzzles were kinda difficult, others were easy. I couldn't believe getting this game almost free with the sale...I would have paid alot more to experience the adventure. I was also surprised I didn't experience any glitches either. I would recommend anyone that enjoys playing point and click games to get this one! The one thing I was disappointed about was the ending seemed to be cut short alittle. It seemed to end but referenced they were waiting for the main character to come back. If they didn't mention that, then I would have felt the story ended completely and felt satisfied."

It's a mild horror narrative that has you save a damsel in distress, mostly linear, with plenty of hints available, and a storyline that serves to glue the puzzles (hidden object or otherwise) together. It took me 3 hours to get through the main content, there's some bonus content but I don't expect it's going to amount to much.Decent game, if you like hidden object games you'll know what to expect, not recommended for anyone who's not into them - there are better ones you could play instead."

The challenge was minimal and only on the final puzzle in the Collector's Edition part, did I have to spend some time trying to work out how to solve the 3 parts to it.  It would have been nice if it had offered up more of a challenge in the rest of the game.Despite its ease, I enjoyed playing it and though the story was a typical barebones one, it did have quite a surprising ending.The depictions of the demon and the steadily deteriorating daughter are pretty neat, as are some of the rooms. The hidden object scenes are fairly bland and very easy and the linearity is total.So, certainly a great bargain for  a fraction under a dollar for 6 hours of entertainment."

,Recommended,299110,14601400,"Posted: 22 February, 2015",all,intox. Requiesta de Silencia,"I tentatively recommend this game to people who are open to point and click hidden objects games. It's fun and interesting with new mechanics introduced every so often to keep it lively but Theatre of the Absurd is really just one long fetch quest with a mostly unexplained plot and poor voice acting. Here's a bit of a breakdown:It introduces new mechanics in the form of magic spells which you use to access other areas of the castles and solve puzzles that you couldn't otherwise. But the spells are limited in number and the puzzles you solve using spells are generally as involved as clicking on the spell and watching the puzzles solve themselves.Everything in this game is pushed by the drive to save a possessed girl named Bethany by collecting several bell fragments. But before that you have to collect sets of a bunch of other objects, some of which you find in hidden object puzzles and others you find just by clicking around randomly on the screen. There are a few non-hidden objects and non-fetch quest style puzzles, but those are limited in number.The story is interesting enough to keep me entertained through it, but at the end of the day I'm left feeling starved. Hidden objects games generally have exceedingly beautiful artwork, soundtrack, and well developed storylines to compensate for their lack of real meaty gameplay. This game has 2 of those, and it isn't the story. The voice acting sure as hell isn't helping.I could forgive a lot if this were an indie game, but apparently it's not so there goes forgiveness out the window. I expect a lot better from a B class developer than this (it's not triple A developed but still). I can still recommend it for some of its intrigue and twists but only if you're able to put up with a lot of backtracking and have a lot of patience.You can check out the first part of my let's play in the video below. I cover the core game but I don't cover any of the extra bits tacked on in the collectors edition on camera. I did, however, finish them off camera and that's what my Steam Review is based on.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6Dw2WUdcw"

Scary enough to get the creepy atmosphere, but not so much that I need to hide under a blanket mountain or change my underwear.The story follows first person Ms. Frost who visits an old rich scientist (?) to see if the valuable object he has acquired is the real thing. As she says it is not, he break the item and a curse is released on him, Frost and the man's young daughter.Miss Frost now has to fix this, mostly to save the young girl. She collects items that help her on the way through hidden objects and and other minigames.The game looks really good, and the music is fittingly atmospheric.The difficulty is pretty good; varying between easy and not-too-frustratingly hard. This game uses the same HO scene more than once and does not remove the items found on the first go, other than the ones used to something before. There is a lot of backtracking and no option for teleporting.There is a hint with fairly long cooldown, and there is a fitting 'punishment' for spamclicking the HO scenes.The story is a bit confusing, though the bonus chapter that is unlocked after finishing the game partially explains some things, but much is implied rather than properly explained.The voice acting is not the best, but not too annoying either. There are a few lines that get irritating as they are repeated a lot, either when location is opened or clicked on, that cannot be skipped.Overall I really enjoyed this game and will probably play it again in the future."

However, once you get into the main story, you have strong narrative and voice acting, excellent art work, and much more animation than you would normally find in an average HOG.The storyline was enjoyable if a little disjointed, and my only real criticism was that the HO scenes were so cluttered, that you could just randomly click on objects and find over half of them in the first few seconds of every scene.Overall, a very solid and enjoyable HOG, if HOGs are your sort of thing."

Sounds like a frightful gaming experience, doesn’t it?Actually this HOG, an appalling barnyard acronym for “hidden object game”, is a serene entertainment for a seasoned gamer with a heart condition like myself. I mean I can’t just keep dancing with death, literally, by playing Far Cry or Assassin’s Creed games all the time, can I?Besides, we human beings love a mystery and a HOG provides the perfect opportunity to break out the magnifying glass. This is my first and I’m enjoying the intrigue of finding clues artfully planted in rooms about the creepy manse, and acquiring items along the way that solve puzzles that help unravel the plot. At least such is my hope. The puzzles are not “fiendishly” difficult and, if you’re blood pressure gets elevated, you can even skip the hard ones.Playing HOGs may be an acquired taste but beside the entertainment value, I think there are cerebral benefits and cognitive gains to be had from virtual detective work, especially for “seasoned gamers.” The developers at Gogii Games have done a masterful job with “Theatre.” If I ever escape the manse, I’ll try another of their offerings.

I hesitated to buy the game when I read some of the reviews here but now I'm glad I did buy it.The game itself begins with a video. A demon has been released and you, as the hero, have to save the little girl in its grip. The player has the option to change from easy to moderate difficulty (more hints in this case), but if you want to solve all puzzles on your own, you don't have to ue the in-game hint option at all. There are a lot of ""hidden object"" puzzles. A list of objects is given and you have to find what is needed. The game is generally spooky, not scary, but demons jump at you and (maybe) you'll get surprised.I re-descovered my love for games like this some time ago when I played Syberia.  I tend to not watch videos or read too many comments before I buy a game because they influence my expectations. This game is a simple adventure, consisting of puzzles and clues. If you want to spend time solving riddles, go ahead. However, the story is not as intense as it could be, and thus buy this game if you have a love for puzzles, and not if you expect to play a visual novel."

However, I did find the voice acting better than most in the genre, and the story was nice (not confusing at all, like some reviews claim).Because of the length, I'd say don't pay full price, but it's definitely worth it on sale."
,Recommended,299110,18118041,"Posted: 20 September, 2015",all,"Boots, the Prophet","I have some mixed feelings about Theatre of the Absurd. In practice, it is a good HOG game, it's mechanics work very well and every Hidden Object scene and mini game can be enjoyed thoroughly. Even though the art style is good looking, it could be better, due to the low resolution at which the game runs.I must say, for a HOG game, this title stands out from others, positively, due to it's atmosphere and creepyness. Basically, the main character, Scarlett Frost, is contacted by Doctor Corvus in order to confirm the existence of a mistical object, named Habsburg Cube, known to hold a demon. Due to a certain event, the demon is released and the doctor becomes possessed by the demon. Now it's up to you to save the doctor's daughter, Bethany, from the demon released by the cube.The main character's voice acting is pleasant, but Bethany's voice not so much. The demon is an ugly figure with a withstandable voice.The existence of a bonus chapter sheds some light about the Theatre of the Absurd's conundrums, but could well be just a part of the main game. Apart from the game being short, the story can be a bit confusing and, for the most part, just plain weird.On the negative side, this title lacks achievements and trading cards. Almost no replayability, only if you really enjoy the game. And the ending is not really conclusive, leaving the player confused.Overall, I do recommend Theatre of the Absurd, not for it's story, nor for it's low resolution, but for the art style, Hidden Object sections, mini games, and for the game's atmosphere, which really can be original in this genre."

The difficultly levels are easy to customize outside or within the game.  Although I struggled with some of the bonus material puzzles, and looked at a walkthrough once or twice, the puzzles were actually fun.  The slight differences among the puzzles add variety.  Since there were no time limits, the puzzles did not feel rushed or pressured, but the story line kept me engaged and was able to replicate the feeling of urgency without the developers slapping on time limits.  The art and behind the scenes sections are phenomenal, and I cannot wait to see where the storyline goes next!I would recommend this game to those who enjoy puzzles, dark mysteries, and/or hidden object games."
,Not Recommended,299110,15089067,"Posted: 28 March, 2015",all,DragonsBayne,"I have mixed feelings about this game. I don't scare easily for one so when I get horror games I don't scale it on the fear factor. I find this game more disturbing than anything, though... not scary or freaky. Shows you how desensitized I am. Also if you are spiritual in any way, you might find this game to be something that IS disturbing because it deals with a sort of demonic possession of a child who you are trying to prevent from being taken by a demon.Storywise it was okay. You arrive at this castle to discern whether an artifact the owner has in his possession is authentic. You say no but that only enrages the owner to which he decides to shatter it to pieces only to release the demon bound within. This demon then tries to possess a the child of the owner or take her away for it's nefarious deeds in which you now have to find a way to prevent her from being taken over and taken away. The girl can't be no more than maybe 7 years old. Your job now is to find 4 parts of a bell that will seal the demon away while protecting the girl from the demon in between you finding the parts. Because somehow the belltower is supposed to be the safest place for the girl. Also, you get powers to use which are spells ""engraved"" on your arm so that you can solve puzzles or use as guidance as to what to do next. These powers allowed you to also dispel areas with demonic fog or read glyphs from a tablet too.The puzzles were your standard HOS's. You get a list of words and have to find them in the scene. After completing them you received items to use for other puzzles in the different rooms you encountered. For example, you might receive golden orbs which were to use for a lock that needed them so you could open the door to the next area. There were also a couple ring puzzles, where you rotated the rings to complete the picture.There was no map that I was aware of. So no teleporting to where you had to go. You had a diary that recorded important things  you needed such as codes and clues. I believe there was two difficulty settings, basically easy and hard.The sound wasn't bad for this game. The music was appropriate for the game but I could not stand the voice of the owner of the castle. For some reason he sounded soooo slow to me. I mean I know he was old but no one speaks THAT slow.The graphics were okay. Mind you I'm running this game on Windows 8 with all the bells and whistles for a fast computer. I did have trouble with seeing some things as they were a bit blurry for me. For example, one puzzle wanted me to find a flower. Well there was yellow lit lantern that overtook the left side of my screen, eerily I might add, and the flower was yellow. So I had trouble discerning it in that instance. Also some items were shadow figures that were sometimes small and blended in a tad too well. Another puzzle wanted me to find a winged lady, but her wings were behind another object so all I saw was a sitting lady until I accidently clicked on her and it got marked off. I wouldn't have known if I didn't accidently click. But still you could tell what most of the objects were.I finished this game around 6 hours but you can easily finish is sooner. The puzzles weren't hard, I think it was just the fact I had trouble finding objects because of the shading and lighting in the HOS's.The game kept you interested enough to keep going to find out what happened, but honestly I got bored towards the end. I bought this game on sale but wished I had bought a different one. As I said, this game was more disturbing for me than scary. If you are spiritual or religious, I would think this game would be a turn off for you as it deals with a kind of precarious situation of sorts. We are talking about demons, a little girl being possessed by one so to speak and finding out what this owner did to want to ""experiment"" around with type of matter. There are references to demonic rituals and such.Overall, not one of the best games I played but not the worst either."

It has a nice variety of puzzles. The only thing that I wish it had was more puzzles, and possibly a little longer; if not a lot longer. That being said, it's on sale for 99¢.
