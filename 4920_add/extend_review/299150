,Not Recommended,299150,18460072,"Posted: 13 October, 2015",all,Faudraline,"A couple of HOG gamers persistently suggestedEmpress of the Deepseries and I sincerely tried to like this one. For that purpose only, this is my third playthrough of the game, in hopes of catching a glimpse of what I might have missed before. I know that it takes a maximum of 2 hours to finish the game, so it's not a labor, but the spark simply is not there.Meet our protagonist: Anna. We watch her drifting into the depths of an ocean in the opening cinematic, and then, she opens her eyes in an odd sarcophagus, remembering nothing of her past. She - who is a bit dim witted, may I say - is told that she just woke up from a century old slumber. She is in a mysterious underwater civilization and two unseen companions welcome her: an old man named Jacob who asks for her to try and gather three royal relics to uncover her own destiny, and a nameless young girl who we can only communicate as a fleeting, creepy voice in our head. One asks for our aid to help the sinking civilization by overthrowing the evil empress and the other asks us to activate 10 uncanny orbs to see something cool. Guess who is actually trustworthy?The setting - besides being a shameless imitation ofBioshockseries - is beautiful, and I'd like to congratulate the visual artist on that manner. It looks old - as if taken from an oldMystgame, but pretty enough. Is there anything else remotely interesting or exceptional about this game? No. Sadly, the whole game doesn't go even one step further than being a collection of pretty environment design. Voice acting is tedious. Characters speak as they are about to fall asleep half the time. And other times, you can swear that Bollywood has seen better acting performances, with more feeling. Animations are actually old stop-motion presentations, and they look a bit eerie in play, which is not the intended atmosphere, I think.HOG scenes are horrendously bad, consisting of cut out stock photographs thrown around in blending colored backgrounds. It is nearly impossible to even recognize whatever you are clicking on half the time, so no one should expect for you to actually search for an item that you cannot identify! You'll quickly find yourself abusing the hint button just to get done with the scene. About puzzles; yes, there are some imaginative logic puzzles. But there is no skip option, so either you complete it, or get stuck on the present point until you manage to solve the puzzle. This becomes disengaging pretty quickly. Gameplay? There is a horrible amount of backtracking for a game this short in playing hours, and there is no usable map option for quick transport either.Still, my major complaint is about the story itself. At the beginning of my blabbering, I mentioned Anna being a bit dim witted. Well, I underestimated. She is downright stupid. I mean, she keeps seeing her own face on a family portrait, side by side with the same girl, and she doesn't get even slightly suspicious of the mischievous little girl voice, who speaks in a tone fitting for Disney villains! We practically see a portrait of the evil empress, carrying those purple orbs all around her, and we still keep activating them! I mean, there should be a limit to how stupid a character can be!In this situation, she was stupid enough to let a maniac blow up the archive of all civilization...Hailing from Gogii games, I'm not surprised to see a below mediocre game. Their games tend to be either brilliant, or horrible anyhow. What I was surprised is that there is a considerable amount of gamers who are in favor of the series. I didn't play the rest of the series yet, so I'm still hopeful that this shoddy little game doesn't represent all that there is for me to discover in Empress' world. I'll see for myself, and inform you accordingly.Update: Please bear with this game, 'cause with the following instalments this makes one great trilogy! I'm still annoyed when I think about this one, but I promise you, losing 2 hours with this game worths it when you experience the rest of the series!Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

It's an adventure/hidden object mix, which has become quite common, but leans more on its adventure side than hidden object, and instead of heaping in hidden object scenes every few steps, includes a selection of different kinds of puzzles, some of which were fairly unique. The hidden object portion is the standard fare you'd expect, perhaps even a slight bit sub-par with the amount of objects I felt I was squinting to make out (even with a hint, some were still unrecognizable in my opinion).The adventure portion, however, more than made up for it. It won't shine in the way a full-fledged adventure game would, but as a casual title, it can be clever with the sorts of puzzles it throws at the player and gives a decent number of rooms to explore. This, though, leads to some backtracking, some of which is particularly unnecessary. Without spoiling anything, the ending makes you revisit nearly every screen to click a single object on each, which was a rather bland way of padding the already short game length.The narrative is decent, but nothing groundbreaking. You'll see any major plot points coming a mile away, but it still gets the job done and gives you a reason to wander the game world. It's also fully voiced, and the actors do well enough a majority of the time.One thing to point out is it ends with a ""To be continued."" It does complete its own self-contained story at least, and the next part is available on Steam.Lastly, it clocks in at a measly two hours. It's worth the ride for fans of the genre, but only on sale. (As of writing this, it's 50 cents, and that's a steal :) )."

It is very puzzle oriented and the puzzles come with no directions. However, if you're familiar with these types of games, you should be able to figure everything out. The story is very cryptic but that actually helps the whole feel of the game, which I liked very much. For an older game, the graphics are quite nice. The hidden object areas are a bit blurry but not bad enough to stump me for long. Even though the game is dated, it DOES have voice acting - sometimes good, sometimes not so much, but always interesting. One thing I absolutely love about Empress of the Deep is that once you've finished everything there is to do in an area, an ""Area Cleared"" Star appears. You never have to worry about coming back to that area to find or do something else. And it gives a nice sense of accomplishment. I wish more hidden object/puzzle games incorporated that feature. The whole game has a very surreal feel to it. It's not a long game but I enjoyed every minute of it. There are also two sequels to this game that continue the story, if you're curious about what happens next. Because of the length of the games, I'd recommend trying to find them on sale. But they're good enough that I'm currently replaying them all. If you like a game with an intriguing atmosphere and plenty of puzzles, check this out!"

If you can grab this game for $2 or less, go for it.The strongest word used is ""damnable"", so I consider it suitable for ages 8+. The hidden objects comprise 50% of the gameplay and aren't particularily challenging, and there's no penalty for using the hint button. The puzzles comprise the other 50% and are based on classic concepts like ""tower of Hanoi"", which makes solutions easy to find online if you get stuck. This is NOT a challenging game and I suspect the intended audience is tweens through teens.I appreciate the fact that I wasn't forced to replay any of the hidden object scenes: once I completed a hidden object  area, it was done. I was glad to see the game using female voice acting and programmers/designers. Show your tweens that women can be a part of the computer gaming industry."

Game got full voice acting,interesting and fun puzzles(though some of them are hard to understand what you need to do),and mediocre story. Also there is a marker to tell you if you completed an area or not(completing means you completed the puzzle in there or found a "" hidden""  item). Puzzle varies with mostly hidden objects but also there are complete a picture,find the difference,find X amount of Y,light an object and such so you gonna have some fun. But also game got some stuff that really annoyed me at the end like misplaced sound effects,annoying movement(to pass through every area till you get to the desirable one) and some puzzles were designed really well and could make you rage a bit.Overall if you get this cheap - $0.5-1 it will be worth it."

I finished the game in 100min which isn't a lot, not even for HO games. The story is very linear and while this is maybe not the most important part of an HO game, it really stands out.Most importantly the HO mini games are no fun. This is mainly caused by the lack of high-resolution textures. The game only runs in 800x600 windowed or the same resolution stretched. The artwork quality is pretty average too. It's rendered with a grainy look and isn't hand-drawn. Together this makes objects harder to find than necessary. Add to this the bad font choice where you can't tell h from b, hat or bat? Animations are not fluid. Overall it's hard to believe that this game is from 2010. It looks and feels like a game from the 90s, when PCs had 800x600 resolution.Other puzzles aren't that interesting. But then, I can't be bothered with the 8-queens-on-chessboard-problem. I prefer fresh types of puzzles.Bottomline: Unless you're really into HO games, avoid. There are many better ones. If you want it, wait for bundles or get it cheap under 1 <<currency>>."

I alredy knew that Gogii Games produced some quality HOGs but this one isn't one of them. To be honest, graphics and voice actiongs are good but at some point the music became annoying. The main weaknesses of the game are the plot and the HO scenes. The puzzles are not perfect also but they are better than these. I've already played the second part of the serie, it was way better. Just for this reason, I'd like to give a thumbs up but how should you recommend a HOG game with awful HO scenes? Again I wish a meh button. Oh Gaben of Olympos, hear us the mortals and give us a fraking meh button. Give it a shot if you grab it from a bundle or so. 5/10."

If you really like the genre, you may give this a try. If not, look elsewhere.I was torn whether to recommend it or not, but I feel it's just about good enough if you get it very cheap (i.e. at a huge discount).The game in detail:# It has only one game mode. It's fairly easy, and the hint button recharges quickly. There's a random clicking penalty, that doesn't really do much (your cursor moves around wildly for a bit).# The graphics aren't good. The HO scenes are blurry, and sometimes, the objects are very difficult to be spotted. Awkwardly, most screens have only one item lying around (usually in plain sight), and once you pick it up, the screen is finished. It felt like a great waste of potential to me.# There are a few mini-games but nothing extraordinary.# You'll spend a good deal of time backtracking. There's a map, but it's pretty useless. You can't use it to ""teleport"", and it doesn't indicate the unfinished screens. Thus, the backtracking gets pretty annoying.# It's quite short. It took me just 1.5 hours to finish it, and I read all the dialogues, watched all the cutscenes, and played all minigames.# The game doesn't have achievements, but for some reason, you collect flowers. They seemed very out of place to me, didn't do anything, and were impossible to miss.# The story is somewhat decent, but you can tell the big twist right from when the characters are introduced.# The voice overs and music are all right."

Guided by Jacob, she must find who she is, why she was awaken and who is behind the purple orbs.Given the fact that the sequels give you some anwsers, yeah, you're in reality royalty that was destined to be the Empress of the Deep... if only your twin sister, hungry with power, didn't try to kill you. And your enemy is... her.While the game isn't as beautiful as Artifex Mundi's products, Empress of the Deep is way better than Theatre of the Absurd, published by the same enterprise and based on the same mechanisms. But here, the plot doesn't really suffer of plotholes. Besides, the places are also less dark and way more colorfuls. Not that I don't mind dark settings.The puzzles aren't hard but I never found a skip button. It was: ""solve it or forget about finishing the story"". The HOG are challenging because the majority of items aren't really seen immediately. Another regret is that the map isn't interactive: you can't go from one place to another by clicking on it.The soundtrack is good too. The voice acting is also well done. I mean, you don't know who to trust because Jacob and the one behind the purple orbs have trusting voices.But the best is perhaps the ending. True, it's a To Be Continued (Song of the Blue Whale is coming after). But it is a quite shocking one.I recommend it. Because well, who never dreamed of being an Empress in a fantasy world?"

Most of the scenes represent a primordial soup where you have no choice but to blindly poke around hoping to catch something. No fun in that.You can't really expect much from a budget HOG in terms of narrative, but many developers at least try to spice up the usual boredom in some or another way. Not the case here, unfortunately. You get all the thickness of undiluted tedium you can get, with no real bonuses to cheer up your miserable in-game existence.I surely will think twice before buying anything else done by Gogii Games in the future, even if it goes only for half a dollar on a sale, and I suggest you do the same."

If you're really so into that you'll pay money for it, I suggest purchasing the original CD-ROM I Spy games. Or the books. This is not an enjoyable game in any sense. The worst part is that the puzzles don't connect with the story or the game. You have to find so many hidden objects to advancec to the next room. Why?

I like the art through most of the game though the style makes it even harder to see the hidden objects in the puzzles. The font is pretty terrible. Sound and music is decent, though for some reason the voice of the main character annoyed me though the same person voices two other characters in the game whose voices was perfectly fine.You control Anna, who recently woke up from coma and explores a small underwater world trying to find out who you are and what's going on. You encounter two characters who help you on your way.Very linear story with a lot of backtracking, the hidden objects outside of the puzzles are overly easy to find. The hint button is there throughout the game so you'll never be stuck. There is no punishment for not getting puzzles right, if you mess around too much you can skip them and on the hidden object puzzles the hint button has a fairly low recharge and no penalty for use.The map is mostly completely useless. For some reason you get a flower as a kind of achievement for every level you finish, though the flowers seem to do nothing other than be a collectable.This is game 1 in a series, but has a decent ending in itself.I suspect this game would be enjoyed the most by kids and pre-teens. Not a bad game directly, just very 'meh' if you're older than that, though the puzzles in this game felt harder than the ones in the 2nd game.

The gameplay is pretty much exactly would you find in pretty much every other hidden object game.  It's very linear, so you don't have to think about the story too much if you're not into it.  Some of the puzzles were tough, but I'm not good at puzzles anyway so that's not a very objective answer.  You do have the option of skipping after you hear the hint.All in all, good distraction, but not worth an investment of time and thought for story.

I originally assumed it was a game for children because it started out so easy, however the puzzles rapidly (too abruptly) shifted from solve in your sleep to ones I finally got frustrated with and looked up the solutions.  It also had a handy Hint/SKIP Puzzle system so I wasn't too frustrated when I got stuck, but I did want to know how to solve one or two of them that stumped me, not just move past the obstacle.The hidden objects puzzle while using a telescope to scan an area was very unique.  Plus finding puzzle clues based on their scientific classification names, matching star maps, etc. were all unique for this genre.The game was colorful, exotic, and interesting.  I thought the ""surprise ending"" was way too obvious (again, was this game originally aimed at children?), which is why I only gave it 4/5 stars.

I mean, grainy 800x600 with no widescreen support? Are we back in 1998? It gets even worse in the hidden-object scenes because some object are transparent for no reason, to the point they're virtually invisible.The story is really stupid but I'm getting used to it in these games. Bad voice acting doesn't help it. With the exception of Jacob the characters show no emotions, they just don't care. So why should I?And last but not least, the map.

You have to manually click the navigation arrow no matter where you want to go - a quick travel would be nice.Or at least arrows that appear instantly, instead of only after a second or so.I liked the voices, and there is text to the voice as well (always good), but apparently no way to skip the speech (you can skip certain cutscenes).On the plus side, you get a visual notification when you have done everything in an area, so you don't have to wonder if there might be something you've overlooked.IMO the biggest letdown is the ending.

The story is one-sided, cliche, and terribly obvious.  The voice acting is extremely akward at times and sounds, in a way, like an audiobook for children.  Certainly this game's target audience seems to very well be children, so no real harm there.  The static environments are pretty and quite whimsical.  All together, the game looks and sounds as though it was built on a tight budget, but was done so using artists who have talent and awareness, none-the-less.Gameplay wise, Empress of the Deep is a mixed puzzler or sorts.  The central theme here is hidden object puzzles, but expect to find some mechanical, mathematic, and clue-finding puzzles peppered throughout.  The difficulty is minimal but not insultingly so.  You may find challenge in some areas but it will certainly be short lived.  Movement is point and click with no pov rotation what-so-ever.  In fact, when you backtrack, you do so backwards while still facing the same direction.  There's no viewing these environments from different angles based on direction of travel, so it's very reminiscent of old first-person adventure games in terms of movement, controls, and static environments.  Additionally, there are no movement transitions/animations.  You simply click the on-screen directional arrow and you instantly move to the new location.  Nothing is time-based (with exception of the hint cooldown) making for an extremely casual experience.I grew up playing games like Myst, Beyond Atlantis, Shivers etc, so I know what to expect with point and click style gameplay.  While this game isn't like those mentioned in any other respect, it is straight-forward and familiar in its execution as a casual adventure puzzle game.  There's no real danger, and you're free to explore and take things at your own pace.  I got this game for $0.74 and I feel I got my 74 cents out of it.I've decided to recommend this game but I do so with reservations.  This game is not something that would interest any majority of the Steam community, but for what it is, and was obviously meant to be, It's a fine game.  To not recommend it based on its rather small target audience would be doing a disservice to its inteded audience and indeed the game itself.  I believe it does a good job at doing what it was designed to do and any fans of hidden object laced adventure games could certainly find value in this title."

Unfotunately a lot of the hidden objects were weirdly transparent or just shadows, which annoyed me.There are also other classic logics puzzles in here, some easier than others, and there's a skip and hint system so its impossible to not finish, just either frustrating or boring. Navigating around the ""room"" was annoying when just transporting thing A to insert into door B.And the worst part was the terrible paint by numbers amnesiac story that comprises the plot. Made no sense."

The graphics are pretty but the characters and storyline is really flat, cliched and predictable - added together with the fact the HOP and Mini-game puzzles are vague and ridiculously hard and the whole thing just becomes a chore. I will complete it eventually as I have the second game in the series but right now, I've got more fun things to do."

Those girls would become more stupid for playing this game.The overall story was really dumb and flat.The romantic, impossible and narcissistic setting offended my sanity.Most puzzles were of the type ""Find the ten hidden items in this clutter."" like ""Find the giraff, the safety pin, the guitar and the letter A, none of which has any business being here."". Not all of the puzzles themselves were dumb, though, which just made them look out of place.It was nice to have that Area Clear star pop up once you've found everything in a location, though. Without it, this game would suck twice at much....so there's no reason to play this game. Have some self-respect for yourself and stay away from it."

I picked this game up when it was on sale for a ridiculously low price, and I have to say that I might have broken my rule for it. Empress of the Deep is short and sweet--I finished the first playthrough in less than two hours--but it plays very well. The story, while not terribly deep, is engaging enough. I found myself content to play through Anna's eyes. The thing that got me most about this game is that the focus seems to be more on puzzles rather than seek and finds. Yes, there are still screens where you're given a list of things to find amongst an image, but there are fewer of them than I'm used to seeing for this genre."

The puzzles are too common / well-known. The graphics might have been nice in 2010, but right now are actually making it harder to find the objects. And the story line is clear from the first purple orb you find. A real disappointment."

It might be a good game if one has absolutely nothing to do and can get it for like 0,50. Or if you're looking for something that would work on some antique hardware, as I was. The recquirements are really low, but that comes with a prize.Resolution is riddiculusly poor, fullscreen has the same resolution as the window mode (looks like 800x600).Story is plain and clear, you can guess all of it within first 15 minutes. It's also linear and that's another fault, as at a time player is forced to do things he knows for sure to be wrong and can't do anything about it.Hidden Object scenes and puzzles are quite average - nothing innovating yet not too easy (at least most of them).So as long as it can be played, I wouldn't recommend to buy it. I feel like I should apologise to my money for spending it so poorly."

I would be looking for one item when in fact it was another item that I needed, but because of what could only be considered a lanuage barrier between different english speaking countries, it did make it difficult at times.Would I recommend this game?
