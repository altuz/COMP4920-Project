It took me about 4 hours to play on advanced, using at most one hint per scene.As a hidden object game, it is mediocre, with the genre's all too common collage of objects not constrained by scale, gravity, or even common sense. Vault cracking is very minor: you get 5 simple logic puzzles in all. The most intersting part of the game are the 5 minigames where you eliminate people from a picture based on given criteria such as ""is eating"" or ""wears sandals"" until only one is left. You also get 5 chances to dress your heroine up with hair, makeup, shirt, slacks or skirt, and shoes. The major part of your time is spent looking for hidden objects. Plot and voice acting are forgettable.The game has 5 chapters; best to save when a chapter ends or begins, as otherwise there might be bugs, check the forum.I'm a general gamer, not a hidden object fan, and I have played quite a few hidden object games that were better than this, such asClockWork Tales: Of Glass and Ink,Paranormal State: Poison SpringsorIsabella. There is no reason to buy this game, unless you have run out of other Hidden Object games to play and this one's on sale."
,Recommended,299170,13037567,"Posted: 22 November, 2014",all,talgaby,"Short version: 67%Vault Cracker is a very low-resolution, really old-school hidden object game with an astonishingly good storyline.Long version:It’s really hard to write a review on Vault Cracker: The Last Safe, because it’s incredibly good and incredibly bad at the same time.The story is excellent; a heist thriller that could easily hold on its own in a modern action adventure game, or even in a movie. It is also devoid of all supernatural elements– something that is almost never seen in modern hidden object games.On the other hand this 2010 product feels like something created at the earliest days of the hidden object genre. The resolution is locked at 800×600. The image quality is horrible with JPEG compression noise everywhere. There is no puzzle variety, just HOPs, which also reminds us of the ancient HO games. And I still don’t quite understand what purpose did the character dress-up sequences serve.Still, if you don’t mind the outdated mechanics and visuals, and the short length, then play it for the story, it will be worth it."

I guess though.EDIT: There is not much Vault cracking either...EDIT2: I don't know why my steam says ""0 hours on record"""

Since the games release on Steam it has been reported to have a nasty string of reported bugs and I myself ran into them from chapter three onwards. So saving your game constantly is a must, unless you love restarting the game from the beginning.Each HOG scene requires you to find an assortment of listed objects from scenes that look like a tonne of grenades have gone off in an op shop. With the low res and high frequency of HOG scenes you will probably develop a headache in no time thanks to the constant mashing of the hint button with your forehead.Occasionally the game breaks up the monotony of HOG with 5 dress up your dolly scenes and 5 open this vault scene by solving a series of puzzles. The puzzles were so easy I was able to solve them by breaking wind randomly in the direction of the keyboard and letting wind power do its magic.There are some interesting and novel quirks to the game like the limiting of people in a crowded room to find the subject you’re looking for that fits all the listed requirements, and even the pick lock system which starts to shrink its correct hit box the longer you procrastinate.The story is that Melissa a cat burglar who is a wizard at breaking into top notch banks using mundane objects like a pair of scissors and some blue tack has had her son Noah kidnapped. Demands of her illegal services are made if she ever wants to see her son alive again. While performing this last job she must uncover the identity of the kidnapper and outsmart them and bring the bad guys to justice. It should come to no surprise that Melissa super power of combining things like garden hose, mirror, fish hook and bread roll saves the day.The real biggest problem against Melissa finding her son is not the bad guy, but more the nasty sudden crashes and glitched sounds that many experience from chapter 3 onwards. It seems the developers at Gojii are even worse than the bank systems she has to break into. As no objects whatsoever are needed to break this game. For the price it is advertised you would think that the developer and publisher would at least offer a properly working product."

,Not Recommended,299170,12409570,"Posted: 8 October, 2014",all,PHARI,"Bugs, glitches and no support make this game a no-buy!Would be a quite nice and solid hidden object game, if it weren´t for the glitches and story bugs. I already played some other games from the same dev without any issues, but this one only arouses despair.No matter which forum I visited, all had the same problems. Asking for bug fixes was never answered by devs. Although it may not be an expensive game, I expect it to work properly"

,Recommended,299170,23594549,"Posted: 16 June, 2016",all,osirish,"The good.Interesting take on the HOG genre that doesn't involve the supernatural for a change, (Although you are looking for your kid again ... *sigh*) , where you play a master thief who needs to come out of retirement for one last job.Original story-line with lots of voice acting.Lots of HO scenes, that have HO scenes within HO scenes, and inventory items are also used within the HO scenes.Some object elimination scenes which were different.The bad.The graphics are average to below average in some scenes. Object definition on HO scenes can be grainy.The lock picking mini-games were incredibly easy and were basically QTEs (quick time event.)There were very few puzzles and again, they were easy. It felt that over 80% of the content was based on HO scenes.Although I only experienced one small bug that I could cancel and continue, others are reporting glitches and being unable to complete the game as a result.Part of the game is ""dressing up"" the character between chapters, which involved more HO scenes, and seems a pointless and tacked on time sink. It adds nothing to the gameplay.The object elimination scenes were stupid. Original, but stupid. For example, you are looking for a woman in a crowd, why can't you just eliminate all the men and children? You can't. You have to go through pointless clues to eliminate every man, woman, and child, one by one, and some of the clues are ridiculous as well. ""He doesn't like lucky charms."" Apparently, that meant having to eliminate someone wearing a sports jacket with the number 7 on it, or someone else with an outline of a horseshoe on their jumper! It made little sense.Overall, the game, while not executed perfectly, with minor annoyances, is a very different from the usual HOGs in the use of it's setting and storyline. I enjoyed my time in the game, and believe the journey was worth the few speed bumps."

This is almost purely a hidden object game where you click on various objects on your check list for no reason at all. Either way, there isn't much of an ""adventure"" aspect except in following along with the plot and mission objectives. These seem to involve you fixing various objects like some kind of repairman and picking out a dozen or so particular objects from a room before throwing away all but 1 of them."
,Recommended,299170,12183717,"Posted: 21 September, 2014",all,Usagi,"Average hidden object game, story is not half bad.The gameplay can get a bit boring though, especially seeing all the silly steps Melissa has to go through to get anywhere. And the dress up feature is completely useless. Granted, there is a plot reason for it but it still adds nothing to the game.Graphics are meh but still not a bad game."
,Not Recommended,299170,26606114,"Posted: 14 November, 2016",all,Mugros,"Low quality HO game. Everything is pretty low res and not very pretty. Release date says 2014 on Steam, but there are solutions from 2010 on the web and the game is probably even older and it shows.It has some nice ideas to mix things up, but the HO screens are not that fun to solve. Too bland, too many items, so that you can even click every item and solve most of the scene without getting a penalty.Has also plenty of minor bugs towards the end. Locations marked wrongly as inaccesible, items marked wrongly as unavailable, list of items to be collected not accepting the item in the shown place.Skip unless you need to play every HO game on Steam."

I acknowledge it is geared more toward those of us of the feminine persuasion due to the clothing choice segments of the game.  If this doesn't deter you (and you can choose to ignore it)  then I believe it is still a very engaging game for all HOG fans.
