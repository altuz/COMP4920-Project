,Not Recommended,299180,14055916,"Posted: 18 January, 2015",all,Praxis-[CE],"Millionaire Manor is a pretty bland hidden object game with little to no adventure plot involved. It's just a series of hidden object 'puzzles' with the only connection being a spinner that selects the mode that the hidden object screen will be presented in (e.g. list, silhouette, puzzle piece, etc.).I didn't find much of a challenge, none of the hidden objects require any kind of manipulation to reveal, and the hardest thing about it was finding the objects in lower quality images (poor lighting, distance perspective, etc.) The most imaginative thing about the game was the constant timed ""Bonus Round"" interrupting the main hidden object screen with another hidden object screen.Each puzzle seems to serve no purpose other than to complete itself. There's no sense of reward or accomplishment, as you get in the more entertaining adventure story HOGs when you unlock the item that you just happen to need to progress in the story. I guess if spotting and clicking random stuff thrown in haphazardly on top of blah pictures is the part of HOGs you enjoy most and you hate the story part where you have to figure out the puzzles, this is the one for you.If this game at least had Steam achievements, then it might be worth the effort to slog through the boring gameplay in order to grab some easy achievements. As it is, there are so many HOGs available on Steam that would be more deserving of your time, even if you picked this one up on sale."

Okay, gramps what have you managed to get yourself into besides a cage along with 5 other caged 'contestants'.  For accuracy's sake two people are in one cage, making 5 cages total.  Despite this bizarre and slightly unnerving introduction the only thing any of this has to do with gameplay is releasing the trapped and caged 'contestants'.  (Making this game 5 levels in total.)I read all the reviews after I played the game and the negative ones did nothing to dampened my enthusiam about recommending this game.  This is what a TRUE HIDDEN OBJECT GAME IS.  No bells, whistles, or storyline beyond the premise.  No walkabout adventure/mystery.  No point and click, puzzles, achievements, or anything else that is associated with today's HO games.  This is a game for a connoisseur and an afficianadio of the Hidden Object genre.Circa 2010 and the third of a series, this game is only about finding Hidden Objects.  The only thing repetitive about this game is probably the music.  So turn it off.  This game uses a spin wheel to chose the type of hidden object play the gamer gets.  It is randomized and there is an auto-spin option.  There are 13 different types of hidden object find ""puzzles"": straight list, combine (which is equivalent to ""extra step"" finds), letter getter (find the alphabet which fill in the letters of find clues - almost like hangman), silhouette, focus (day version of night mode played with a fuzzy picture and a magnifying glass), riddle (i.e. orange and rabbits favorite food), elimination (eliminate several series of items from the scene before a riddle to the object needed to be found is given), triplets (find three of the same object), find 10 (find 10 of something), spot the difference, puzzle (match the puzzle piece to the puzzle piece in the scene) and countdown (30 seconds to find the object).  Just the variety of different types of Hidden Object ""puzzles"" is staggering compared to today's games.  Now add to this about 30 different scenes and the game is a very far cry from repetitive some claim this game is.I never played the same thing twice, and not until near end did I even get the same scene (and then with a different puzzle type).  A mention about the scenes, the objects in the scene are what one would expect to find in say a garage, a swimming pool or a bedroom.  Albeit a very full garage, cluttered swimming pool, or extremely messy bedroom but overall the items are appropriate to the scene not just random junk.The object of the game is to release the 6 trapped and caged 'contestants', who they themselves are a bit over the top.  Their banter is pretty amusing, as well as their stereotype.  There are six total game rounds that must be played to release each contestant. (In one case, 2.)  However, each game can be extended with bonus rounds (up to 3).  (I think this is random, or NOT getting bonus rounds may depend on whether or not the gamer lands the stop in a small gold area on the spinner.)  Despite playing a bonus round on the same scene the puzzle type is different, and the objects move or are added depending of the puzzle type.  During gameplay ""bonus"" scenes show up that the gamer can click on. (I only ever got two per puzzle.)  These bonus scenes last 15 seconds during which time the gamer must collect as many broken token pieces as they can.  These tokens give the gamer hints, 2x hints, skip (a puzzle type when placed on the spin wheel), and/or an unlock (unlock a new puzzle type) depending on how many pieces the gamer collects.  After each game round a scoreboard is given showing accuracy, tokens, etc.  (Accuracy may depend on misclicks, less misclicks the higher the accuracy??)That is the game.After everyone is free, the Master of Ceremony states the ""gamer"" cannot leave because there is more to do.  The ""more to do"" is found in the extended play area on the main menu.  In this extended play area, scenes are shown with stars beneath indicting which type of puzzle that has or has not been played.One warning: Some the scenes have windows which are so bright the objects in them can not be seen.  I thought this was probably my computer but apparently not.  Others have mentioned/complained about this.  I am quite sure if this game was ever remastered that this would no longer be a problem.  My solution was to use hints or simply randomly click on the window to ""see"" if anything was there.  Compared to some of the bugs I have encountered in newer games this was barely a shrug on the annoyance scale.So yes, get this game, and though I received this as a gift, full price is well worth it."

The Story is nonsensical and lackluster. That aloneI wouldn`t mind so much but the Gameplay, while theoretically varied with lots of gamemodesis absolutely random. You spin a wheel that randomly gives you a Gamemode. This meansthat you will most likely play the same modes again and again and never get to see some of theothers.Still I could forgive the Game this if it didn`t fail at the most important part, the Hidden Objects.While they should be more or less hard to find, I have encountered several Objects that were simplyimpossible to find without Hints due to bad contrast and lighting. Even WITH the Hint I couldn`t see1 or 2 of them while staring right at them. Only blindly clicking on the area were they revealed.TL:DRIf you are a Hardcore HOG Gamer and want to complete your collection, buy it during a sale.Everyone else stay far, far away from it."

And I had fun!- There's variance to the puzzles, different game modes.- A clever frame/story to get you to play the games and dive right in (without tedious running around or any half-hearted pretense at adventure).- Solvable puzzles, and plenty hints available for you to use or ignore.- The only truly timed games are the bonus rounds.- Random clicking won't get you anywhere.If more Hidden Object games are like Millionaire Manor, I might become a fan.Only negative:- No Steam Overlay, no Steam screenshooting.I'm very stingy, but even I find this game is well worth more than the 0.49 euro I paid for it. If you think 5 euro isn't much, it might even be worth the full price for you.Edit: For someone with my terrible memory there's also great replay value (plus training memory). You can not only play all puzzles as often as you like in extended mode, you can also make different profiles (for different people playing or just yourself again from the start) and also delete them if you feel like playing yet again from the start."
,Recommended,299180,23013723,"Posted: 15 May, 2016",all,shiaakuma,"TL;DR version at the bottom.This is really not that terrible of a HO game, but there are a few things that you need to know before you give it a try.Firstly, this is an old-school HO game, without a map/travel or inventory management puzzles.  Like many of the older games, it's just finding objects in a scene packed with dozens upon dozens of items.  If you are looking for something like the new Artifex Mundi games which are more intricate and have more features, you probably won't be thrilled with this.That said, there is a wide variety in the types of HO scenes in this game.  Essentially, you spin a wheel for each scene to see what variation you'll be playing, with a ""skip chip"" that can be used to block off a certain type that you don't like.  While they are all ""find the object"" variations, there is enough variety to keep it interesting (combining objects, traditional list, timed, silhouette, plus some pretty different ones that you don't see often).I've seen some complaints about pixel hunting and low-res graphics, but to be honest, I had no difficulty with it.  There was no pixel hunting for me, and all of the objects were defined well enough for me to easily discern what they were.  The scenes can be difficult, especially depending on the mode, but I don't feel like the graphic quality is the problem.  That's not saying that it's a gorgeous game, it definitely comes off as old with dated graphics, but not to the point where it hinders the gameplay.It is a VERY short game.  I clocked in at 2 hours from start to finish in one sitting.  Finishing the game unlocks the ability to complete each scene with the different game modes, which adds a touch of replayability for people that enjoy the simplicity of HO scenes without the story.  I would recommend getting it on sale due to its age and lack of frills (I picked it up for $0.99 and it was a buck well spent, in my opinion).About the story... there isn't much of one, which is pretty common for these early games.  If you go into it for the gameplay and not the plot, it's not that big of a deal.  If you want a deeper story (or any story...), again you may want to bypass this.TL;DR: only worth playing if you don't mind the old-fashioned HO games that are ENTIRELY object seek without frills, bells, whistles, or embellishments, but well worth it if you like the old-style HO games.  Due to the short playtime, I suggest getting it on sale."

This large variety offers a long play time……if you ever decide to actually go that far. Unlike the previous games it’s not required to play every game mode on every level to finish the story, 100% completion is purely optional. But some of the modes are so frustrating or boring that it is doubtful many people will ever want to reach this goal.A HO game veteran probably won’t find anything appealing in it, since it uses the same mechanics as the first part released in 2008, but for newcomers it may be an excellent starter game with a decent price/length ratio."

You can not choose which type of mode you get, you have to spin a wheel so it's random.Extended play (after ""beating"" the normal play) could have been redeeming since then you can do the game modes you've missed in the different hidden object scenes, but by then I was so bored, I de installed. I felt no sense of reward but completionists might like to do all modes on all scenes and fill the board with stars :)Don't buy if not on super sale.Edit: I forgot to mention the bonus thingies that randomly pop up with which you can earn extra hint tokens: they are timed with a nervous melody that made me rather jittery."

,Not Recommended,299180,23176580,"Posted: 23 May, 2016",all,osirish,"Once again, I wish Steam had a ""Maybe"" option.Very basic HOG. No real story line. No puzzles. Just variations of HO scenes. Standard list of objects to find, find the outline of the object, eliminate objects to find the one you want, find hidden letters to spell out the hidden objects, and the most annoying one of all ... find the object based on riddle clues.The whole premise of the game is it's a game show. You spin a wheel that randomly selects what type of HOG scene you get, but that's where it gets really annoying. It's possible to keep getting the same types of scenes over and over depending on where the wheel lands. You can earn skip tokens, to skip the ones that annoy you, but it really doesn't matter, because the wheel only selects the first game you play, and then that's followed by two more random scenes chosen by the host. I hated the riddle scenes, I opted to skip them, I played a different scene, and then the host decides he wants to give me riddle scenes!As the game progresses, you unlock more types of HO scenes, but there's no real sense of progress, it's just scene after scene after scene.Overall ... this game is old fashioned HO. No bells or whistles, just pure HO ... and if that's what you are looking for, it's fine. The genre has moved on from this to bigger and better things, and if you are used to playing newer ""adventure"" HOGs, you will probably want to avoid this one. It's basic, it'll scratch your HO itch for a few minutes, and then it starts to get uncomfortable. If you must, try to pick it up on a sale."

A different take in this game is that each hidden object scene has a number of different modes, which are chosen randomy through spinning a wheel.  Modes include things like list (regular HOG where you find objects from a list), silhouette (silhouettes only, like what shows in some HOG hints), getting a hint rather than the item name, etc.  Once completed, you can go to an Unlimited HIdden Object type of bonus stage where you can choose the modes for the scenes that you did not play before.  The game doesn't explain what the Bonus thing that pops up is until you click it--make sure to click it, as this is how you earn hints. Hints are fixed and do not recharge, you must earn the tokens and unfortunately once your stack is maxed out they no longer accumulate."

My wife and I play Hidden Object Games for fun, and Millionaire Manor is one of the better of the half-dozen or so we have played.  Unlike some games, the objects mostly are appropriately sized and placed (not huge, or stuck on the ceiling, for example).  Yes, in a few cases poor contrast makes an object invisible, but that is not particularly uncommon in our experience with other games.Although short, the game seems clean and professional.  We like that the game has an unusual variety of different modes, such as: list (the usual HOG mode),  silhouette (only the outline of the object), matching (combining 2 objects to make the list item), alphabet (first find all the letters, with only the found letters presented when naming the object), and jigsaw (place a row of jigsaw pieces at their position in the room), among others.  After the main game, Extended Play covers the rest of the modes on each of the rooms, which may be longer than the main game.The evil master of ceremonies is just a hoot!  We enjoyed it!"

This adds much needed variety to the genre. I also initially liked the bonus game where you collect chips to help you out. In the end, however, this got a little wearing. I was also left wondering why, despite collecting numerous 'unlock' chips, I never seemed to unlock the final type of game - perhaps that's a feature because I have the extended version.The voice acting is TERRIBLE and the music is really annoying after a while, so for a better experience, turn off the sound and play your own music instead. Also I think it's a shame that all of these hidden object games seem to be so lazily targeted at women by having a female character who needs to save her children/relatives etc. It's nice they acknowledge that there are women who play games, but I'm not convinced this aspect added any more to the game than if I was a genderless character who stumbled into some strange manor and was drawn into a game.Also, I have no idea why it's called 'Millionaire Manor'....Generally, though, it's worth a few quid and was satisfying for a couple of casual gaming hours."

The sounds and soundtrack are fine until hearing it for the nth time drives you crazy. The gameplay however is bogged down with a flawed concept and waaaay too much repetition.

It is based on a concept that you are playing a gameshow and trying to rescue previous contestants that lost but it isn't a strong story line that keep pulling me back into the game.What does keep pulling me back into it are the new ideas Gogii added to the Hidden Object game genre.  Like I said this isn't a strong story driven game much like Artifex Mundi games BUT it does add many new concepts when looking at the same scene; match 3 (adds an extra 2 items somewhere), find 10 like items (adds another 9 items to the scene); Find Alphabet Letters to spell words of objects you must find; Riddle (you need to decipher a sentence to know what to search for), Puzzle (yes puzzle pieces that make up the scene), Combine (kind of deciper an easy meaning that translates to 2 items in the scene), List & Sillouette to name most of them but not all of the modes.  There are 12 modes.  Also as you play, you get a chance to play 15 second bonus games that let you earn hints, unlocks (to unlock a new mode) & skips (if you didn't like a particular mode).  Going back to comparing Artifex Mundi, there isn't any map to this game.  It is mainly a game show theme much like 'Discovery! Seek and Find' where the scenes change and not your position on a map.  (Thus you don't need to remember where to use an object because you don't pick up any objects to carry around.)The scenes keep changing rapidly so you don't feel any staleness in looking at scenes or for objects.  I also find this game moderately hard to find objects and I've needed to use hints.If you like HO games and you want to try something different in the HO genre, I'd suggest trying this game out."

While I give the game much credit for the idea and an actually interesting antagonist, I got tired of the game very quickly. The reason for that wasn't the game play, but the lack of an actual fullscreen mode. The scenes are repetitive, but the various types of games helped with that.If I didn't have to have the screen next to my face to see what was going on, I would have probably finished the game at least.

A little frustrating at times, but more due to the challenge level than low game quality. Plus, the game is fairly accessible - only one mode involves a time limit, and hints are fairly easy to come by and don't seem to count against you (nor does time taken); the only issue I can think of is that the Find The Difference mode is not color-blind friendly.If you like hidden-object puzzles, it's a pretty good pick up!"
