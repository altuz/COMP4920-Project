I purchased the early access so that I could be part of the development process, which I was expecting to last 12-18 months. Here we are a month or two later and its considered ""retail"" ready. No, this is yet another embarrassment to the Early Access/Kickstarter way of doing things.If you are looking for a ""simulator"" do not buy this. Anybody that considers this as a simulator doesn't know the meaning of the word as it has no simulator aspects to it.  I am very disappointed in the game, the developers and Steam for continuing to allow developers to release early access games that they have no intention of finishing and just want to make a quick buck. If the game remained in Early Access I wouldnt have an issue, but this is not a finished product.Early Access and kickstarter products like this are legalised theft, that is all I have to say."

But, maybe I can help you save a few hard earned dollars).I have a decently beefy machine.  Not a monster computer, but a 6 core 4.2ghz machine with an AMD R9 200 series video card and 8gb of RAM.  It doesn't struggle with any games I play - except this one.  The frame rate is just horrid (sub 10fps).  And changing the video settings doesn't seem to do anything for me.Additionally, the gameplay is, well... lame.  I absolutely love sim games (days of play time on ETS2), but this is a huge disappointment.  Other ships in the harbor will run right into you, even if you run your horn.  The controls are poorly implemented, in that you can't easily reset them to ""0"" by adjusting them left or right, as you do to increase the throttle.I haven't played a ton so far, because it is frankly frustrating to play.  I was suckered in by the decent reviews that were likely posted with this being an ""early access"" game in mind.  Now that it is a real release, I can only call B.S. on this one.Devs - feel free to credit my account for my $20.  I know you won't, but that'd be the right thing to do."

Arguably, there was an effort by the Euroboat team to make it appear that way. Unfortunately, with European Ship Simulator, what you get is a shallow experience at best without any campaign mode, meaningful objectives, or even a sense of immersion to say the least.I've completed 4 of the missions so far, successfully I might add, and it wasn't challenging at all. You have a short selection of ""Missions"" along side a mission editor. I started off with a tug boat mission. The tug boat itself was sufficiently detailed and breaking into open sea from the harbor was satisfying, the choppiness kicked up and there seemed to be correct current physics to deal with. That, unfortunately, was about all there was to be impressed by.Dropping the tug was a simple press-this-button, which displays a bunch of balloons around your boat. All I had to do was select one of my ballons, and click on the balloon from the ship I would be towing. This easy process connects the two balloons together with a rope, instantly. At this point I'm ready to tow. The massive tanker's front end would dip inappropriately into the sea while towing, which was weird. The physics aren't perfect but I can get passed it. There is no complicated mooring procedure either once you get to your destination. You simply float to the next arrow and you're done. Congratulations. *yawn*Later, I tried the speedboat. A speedboat mission! My objective was to drive my speedboat to a yacht and pick up a rich lady in distress. On my way, I clipped through just about every bit of ocean, I was practically a submarine. Additionally, the reaction of the boat to the choppy water felt so unauthentic that it made me feel like the developers included this irritation just to force me to press the A and D keys a whole bunch of times and not fall asleep.To spice things up, I tried the cruise liner. I figured, this should be a challenge. Wrong again, and that brings me to my conclusion. European Ship Simulator is a disaster at the price it is asking. I've played more complex and immersive sims on the iPad. I don't know how some people came the the conclusions they did by recommending this game, it really does make me wonder. The game offers you nothing in return for your effort. It is over-simplified, unrealistic and broken. Wait for the massive content update it needs and in the meantime there are better boating simulators out there."

It will require at least an additional 500 man-hours to reach the status of what I would label a “final release”. In every other industry, a company would lose a tremendous amount of money and market value if they would decide to put such a product on the market.Unfortunately the whole game industry seems to take the same path of laziness, which is why I cannot personally blame the developers of European Ship Simulator.Another thing, I understand the word “Simulator” as a software that tries to emulate reality as accurately as possible within technical feasibility. And by this definition that game does not even come close to a simulator.Maybe I will come back to that entry next year in the hope to see the positive changes, but as for now, I definitely not encourage other people to buy this game."

Also, there is very little actual game here, even for an early access title. You have very constrained mission areas to play around in, no roaming the high seas. The largest area is a trip across the English Channel at night.Also, the physics are somewhat suspect, as your boat cannot so much as touch anything else without sinking, no matter how gentle the inpact.Another black mark is that the UI and menus are very unpolished, and very little exists in the way of tutorials. Even yourincoming radio messages are simply texts, with no voice acting. You truly feel alone in the world they are presenting.Even though the game doesn't feel in the least bit like a finished game at this point, it is leaving early access."

It just got boring. European Ship Simulator is not really a ""free world"" game. The game also only offers missions so you must follow the orders the game tells you to do or else there's no point into playing.

Even if I could forgive some of this game's faults, the constant crashes and restrictive gameplay are just too much. Unless you find this game as part of a package deal (on Humble Bundle, for instance) or at an extremely low price, I'd have to say ""No, don't buy this game."""

I am pretty sure my graphics are on high / ultra, and it looks like it was made back in the 12th Century. It is possibly the slowest, most tedious game i have ever played to date. The missions are not too bad i guess, but they take ages to complete, and the control over the ships is awful. They are really slow, which wouldn't be so bad f the scenery was nice, but even that is a pixelated blob of colour. I will be honest, i don't have a moniter, i use a TV screen, that is like 7 years old, so that may explain a bit of the bad graphic quality, but nonetheless, it is not a game that grabs me. Better off getting Euro Truck Simulator, though by now i imagine most people that will see this have already got Euro Truck Simulator 2. Oh well, American Truck Simulator cam out the other day, get that instead.P.S. I have not played American Truck Simulator long enough yet to comment fairly on it, so maybe wait until i give the all clear :) Or just...you know, read someone elses review of it :)"

Was doing a reasonable 14 knots in lumpy sea with no prior damage to ship!Pretty slow framerate when another ship passed me in Dover = given I have decent computer and graphics card.Looks promising - so long as additional ports and ships are added to initial release for free and not some exhorbintanly priced DLC!Also note that there is no option to save game in present release - have to play till you 'timeout' or sink (for no reason) in my case!"

The graphics, especially of bridge interiors, are excellent. While I'm not an expert on ship physics, they seem pretty good. The learning curve for this game is not too steep, by and large, and after a couple of early failures, I have played about 75% of the missions and passed them all. However, the game does have one or two little bugs, and there are some areas where it could improve:1) The text goes weird when you try to change the settings. It's OK initially, but when you go back a screen after making your desired change, it all gets screwed up somehow.2) Ships seem rather too fragile. You can sink by hitting a pier at low speed! The level of damage needs to be more realistically adjusted.3) The AI boats behave strangely at times. In the cruise liner mission for example, a boat that appeared to be going past me suddenly turned in a sharp circle right in front of me! They are also unrealistically indestructible - bump into one, and you'll sink, but it won't!4) In the ""berth the ferry in a severe storm"" mission, the weather is actually perfectly calm!5) As others have mentioned, there is no career or campaign mode. This would boost the game enormously, as currently there's not a lot left to do after you've played the missions (although you can supposedly make up your own, or edit existing ones, with the Mission Editor).I also think the game could possibly benefit from time being sped up a little à la Euro Truck Simulator, or maybe players could be given the choice between ""real"" time and ""fast"" time. Some missions kind of drag a bit, even when you're going at your boat's maximum speed. But these bugs and irritants notwithstanding, the game is generally good fun, which is why I recommend it overall. Also, it is a fairly new product that the developers are giving a lot of time to right now. Already since I bought it, there has been an update. So hopefully this promising game will soon be even better in the future."

Driving the same ship, over the same course, at the same time of day, with the same weather, with the same AI ships in the same positions, with the same sea state… you get the picture. It will quickly get put away and not played.If it becomes a true simulator, with a purpose for my ship to leave the harbor, and ability to sail to multiple ports in a variety of conditions, then this sim will be fantastic.I always thought: build it and they will come.

There's not much to do, but at least you can sit back and relax, especially when commanding big cruise ships, ferries, etc. The game has excellent graphics and the water looks visully stunning, especially when you are out in the middle of the ocean and high up on the bridge. You can walk around the bridge on larger ships and see the scenery from every angle. Graphic quality inside the bridge is excellent. The controls are good as they offer precise steering on the ships. Game runs absolutley perfectly on my PC and I have never had any crashes. I also get a fantastic frame rate. I also love the 'swell' effect at the boats sway on the waves. Port Control speak to you and keep you updated on what you have to do which is great. Sounds are spot on, including engine sounds and cab switches/controls.Overall, I think is a great game and a must-have for any simulation gamer.

However, the game could have been so much more, but a dispute during development spoiled all that.  I had no trouble installing or playing the game.  I have decent frame rates on the highest settings and have not had a crash as of yet.Pros:  The graphics are very good and easily on par with FSX and are more like Silent Service 5.  The bridges are very nicely done indeed and remind me of some of the addon planes cockpits that I have for FSX.  Highly detailed, large in some cases and very nicely executed.  The exterior orbit camera mode is very nice too and the ships look very good.  I am not a sailor, but the player ships do seem to move very well and are not overly responsive.  There are even seaguls flying around the ports.Cons:  No freeroam mode with missions only.  There are not a lot of missions either, but there is step by step guide on the Steam Forum to teach you how to create your own missions.  I could not find any downloadable missions, addons or mods on the internet.  You are locked into the bridge and cannot wander about the ships (fair enough - you are stuck in the cockpit in FSX as well).  There is no career mode or campaign.  The water within the ports should be far calmer than the outside sea.  That is the whole point of the water break haven walls!  The water break on the bows of the ships is static and stays in place even when the bow is lifting up out of the sea on the crest of a wave.  It does not move with the level of the sea.  There are no other crew members or people to be seen, nor is there any radio traffic, so it is a bit lonely and quiet.  There is no full world out there (hence no free roam), just some routes built in to enable travel to and from specific ports only.  The other AI ships have a ridiculously amazing ability to turn on the spot at speed.  Not very realistic to watch a large container carrier turning on a sixpence like a jet-ski.  There are far too many controls, buttons and screens in the bridge which do not work and are not interactive.  Lastly, the Time Jump button is only active for a short time.  If you do not use it in time, you will have to do the entire voyage in real time!Conclusion:  This game by graphics is streets ahead of it's intended successor 'World Ship Simulator' which looks very childish and rudimentary by comparison to this game.  The fact is, this game could have been so much more.  The day will come when someone finally makes a ship simulator along the lines of FSX and X-Plane.  This game could have a full world out there, with more controls working in the bridge.  It could have been done in such a way that other developers get involved with building addon ports, ships with fully working bridges, interactive port communications as per FSX, etc and giving some of the take to this games developers.  Just as we have with FSX.  A missed opportunity there.  I have Ship Simulator 2008 which is let down by it's old graphics and I also have the early access 'World Ship Simulator'.  So far, European Ship Simulator knocks the socks of those in terms of beauty and bridge detail.  For it's current price of £5 ($7.50) on sale at time of writing, it is well worth a look."

The response of the vessels is unrealistic and when I saw the lines (rope) I was amazed at how strange it looked and jumped around.. Other than that, the graphics are good and I think there is potential here but the developer has got to get serious about this being a ""simulator"" and not just a game.

It would be nice to have an indication if I had both throttles set evenly while in interior view.  It is difficult to ascertain (at least for me) just from their visual position.  Perhaps a small indicater either with a number equal either to how many ""clicks"" I've moved the throttle from zero, or an RPM indication?  Don't want to clutter up the screen though, so maybe another clickable icon along the side?

Said it was coming out in Augest but actuly came out in November, but toataly worth the wait. I have spent a lot of time getting use to at first, seeing that I crashed into the pier the first few times. Only three big suggestions I would make at this point. They are:1.ADD A TUTORIAL! There is no real tutorial at the start, you are just expected to know how to play.2.Add a free drive mode. Have a free drive mode were use can just drive a speedboat around or something.3.Add controler support. I think it would probley be easier to controlif you were using a wheel or Xbox 360 controller.Overall, I would highly recomend this game"

Now I'm not totally negative, I do like the selection of ships, and the models look very nice.  I also enjoy the ship traffic, and the weather modeling is very good.

My personall favorite thing to do is sink a ship full of passengers. The game is pretty enjoyable at times, and can be fustrating when new to the controls. If a free roam/open world element were to be added where you could explore the open sea and own your own boat buisness and start by driving other peoples boats until you have enough money to buy your own and then you could hire others to work for you, and then when you get to a certain point in the game, just explore without the worry of losing money since your employees will be making you endless amounts of money. Or a Euro Truck Simulator but with boats. It's definitally worth a buy if your into boats and driving them.TL;DR?7/10, would sink again."

Its not really a simulator and the missions are lacking details, and its boring with little replay value - Even completing a mission gives no rewards (its just misison over) or even a points or scoring system. Other ships have no AI and use predetermined parameters meaning they go the same way every time and physics between the different boats does not seem to change much (they all seem to turn too quickly). Its also far too easy to sink a ship by tapping a dock. Game optimization is awful with task manager showing it using 1.8GB RAM and 93% CPU (on a Core i5) taking my CPU to 100%. Judging by the other games the Developer has made (one where Speed Bumps was one of the major features of the game) I now get the impression they do not have the technical skill (or finances) to make this game have the basic features the community have been asking for (realistic physics, steering wheel support, in cockpit HUD, Maps), where this game is missing many basic features that were present in the last generation of Ship Simulators. I will however praise the dev for updates and being active in the games forums and replying to people (I wish all companies were like this), although more often than not the reply is negative, stating they are a small team with little finances and the feature will not be added. These days any kind of simulator is a massive undertaking as ETS2 has really raised the bar. I just get the feeling they are in a bit over their heads and a game like this is too ambitious for this developer."

The Ship Physics are totally unrealistic, and a lot of People ( i included) told the Developers in the Forums, that some things a more then wrong, but they did not change it. One simple thing is, that the Engine from (i think it was the ferry) goes up to 4000 RPM, and that is totally unrealistic (the real Maximum of a single Marine Diesel is aprox. 650 RPM). The Speed must be shown of the propeller shaft and not such Fantasy Values like 4000 RPM. Then its funny, that you can drive the heavy Ships like a Car, and the Steering of a heavy weight Ship is like driving a Go-Cart. All this shows me, that the Developers never really invested Time to make some inquiries about the Physics and Basics of a real Ship. Also funny is the Cruise Ship, if you have 0% Power on the Engines, the Ship brakes immediately like a Car within a few Meters. Everybody who has a little bit physical appreciation knows, that you cant stop such a big and heavy Ship within a few Meters so easy.Well positive is, that the Graphics are better as in SSE, and that they implemented some famous Ports in Europe, like Rotterdam, Hamburg and Rostock."

,Not Recommended,299250,13477649,"Posted: 20 December, 2014",all,Dr. Jester - wubba lubba dub dub,"Changing my position since the Early Access Review (read below).This simulator is still bare bones, and lots of bugs. It would be really fine if it was still under Early Access, but sadly it is not anymore. This is not the final product I was expecting.Here's an example, starting my tug mission at somewhat 13:00 hours, it should be bright outside. But it feels like dusk. The brightness and daylight is wrong. I start moving my tug to two ships that collided a few miles from my position. The movement of the ship in the water feels superficial, as there is no proper wake and although the bow wake seems fine, it still needs work. The water displacement, which you would expect from a couple of tons ship is barely noticeable. There is also water transparency missing.  A few other simulator and games have done a better job at wake too, like Total War: Rome 2, Deadliest Catch: Alaskan Storm, Silent Hunter Series, and even Spintires(The best water simulation and wake I've seen in a while).Moving forward...There is no depth radar, and only basic instrumentation. Reaching the two ships I receive the order to attach my tug boat to one of them. Sure, the line attached to my boat is also bugged, as in it doesn't look tied but like a big gigantic straight piece of rope glued to the ship.Moving on, a few minutes later a Coast Guard ship collides with the ship being towed. Showed no desire to slow down or deviate from the collision. In fact, it kept going even when it still collided to my towed ship.A few minutes later, my ship and the towed ship jumps around and I'm suddenly sinking!I hope the devs doesn't get dishearten over their product, because there are still a lot of love in it. Which I explained in my Early Access review. Like the texturing of the ships, the lights, and the water. But this is definitely not a finished product and I sadly CAN NOT recommend it as such. As an Early Access, sure, but not the way it is now. Buy it when it is on sale or when they fix this (which I will update this review accordingly if there are changes and if those changes are positive, I will recommend the simulator at a later stage)__________________________________________________________EARLY ACCESS REVIEW:So far, the simulator seems to be scratching an itch that hasn't been scratched in ages.I love the attention to detail, and how they really bothered in making the ships. I love ferries but I fell in love with the fishing ship. Life huh!I also love the water, although I feel it needs a bit more love as in transparency (side of boats and docks and depth) refraction and reflection. But I would also love if we had proper ship wakes. A few games that managed to nail wakes, that I've seen are Silent Hunter 3/4/5, Deadliest Catch: Alaskan Storm(dynamic wakes) and Spintires(Dynamic wakes), and I would love to see that beautifully well-formed foam around the ship, giving a sense of movement, or that you are displacing tons of water.And the developer's approach to the community and how they are handling criticism, suggestion and even the comments are very commendable. I think this simulator has shown a lot of promise, and I can't wait to see the developer’s dreams over this simulator come true.I also like how the light reflects over the surface of the ship, tiny things like that immerses you more than you can imagine.In other words, it is still Early Access, bare bones, probably pre-alpha, and still needs a lot of work, but what it already has is fun and worth the money! So, if you like simulation and ships, this is definitely something you should buy!"

,Recommended,299250,21855134,"Posted: 15 March, 2016",all,BLUCHER,"Many have slagged this game off for being ""too slow"" or lacking gameplay, some say it is boring. I have helmed ships big and small in real life and have to say that the reactions to engine and helm are spot on. This is the best shipping simulator I have been on. Graphics are brilliant, plenty of single player missions and the ability to build your own missions as well. The 3d enviroment within the bridge of each ship is stunning, and controls whilst simplistic, are sufficient for anyone. The introductory mission of tug and tow, is quite accurate, and the final ""nesting"" of the  cargo freighter into its assigned berth is testing but fun using both towing skills, knowing when to drop the tow, and final pushing along the hull to adjust freighters position. In real terms, these jobs on full size vessels must be done slowly and with care to avoid accident or damage, this is reflected in what you do here. For a fun game simulator, I was a bit dubious about purchasing at firest, but now I am glad that I got it."

You can control your ship via keyboard or just using the mouse to handle the levers and switches yourself. Being able to walk around the bridge is awesome too. You get a nice sense of scale when captaining a large ferry that I really enjoy.You're currently limited to 3 missions, which is understandable given it's Early Access, each with a different boat and in different conditions. Involving both Dover and Calais. I take this route a lot and can say attention has been made towards the skylines of both these towns and ports, which again is a nice touch.You can even sink the ship and stand on the bridge as you witness the area filling with water, if that's something you're into."

Things like leaving the bridge and exploring the whole ship, being able to zoom in from the first person view, more camera options and functional lifeboats. The damage system is not so great either. My ship sunk in a few seconds after colliding with a small vessel.  I'm waiting for the upcoming updates and patches.

Please watch videos of this game on youtube before buying this game. Do your resach and don't make the mistake I did__________________________________________________________________________________Main PromblomThis game claims to be a ship simulater, which it is. This game also claims to be an open world game. Which it is not. This game is a simulator that allows you to spawn in a ship and procced from point A to point B. This is not open world. To me open world is when you can spawn and go any where you want. In this game you can NOT do that. Another thing I wanted to say is this game has been out for about 3 years. Anther game I play and love called Unturned is also 3 years. (just had its 3 year anniversery) Untunred was developed by 1 person. While this game was developed by an entire company! Unturned is still updating to this day. Infact a HUGE update for that game was just released that adds a new map and a heck load of content. ESS stoped updating after a few months of World Ship Simulator was released the same day and year of Euro Ship Simulator was. Keep in mind 1 person managed to keep a game alive for 3 years while an entire company can't even release a bug fix update.__________________________________________________________________________________Pro's- A few missions that you can do with varents of ships/boats.- Has a mission editer ( I'm to stupid to figure it out ).- Desent water graphics but not great.- Working AI__________________________________________________________________________________Cons- Speed boat has VARY VARY VARY sensitive turning.- No open world as the store page catagories says it does have open world.- Mission editer to complacated for some people. ( Including me )- Game stopped updateing at an early stage of development. Suprised it came out of early access.- Lack of ship interior. From what I seen in Ship Simulator Extreames you can explore almost the entire ship you selected. While in this game you can only walk around the navagation bridge.- Ship horns sound nothing like they should. A week before this review I went on a cruise. Before the ship leaves port the ship horn honks 3 times. The horn sounded loud and low pitched. I also heard many other cruise ship horns in my life time and they sound loud and mighty. In this game ESS the cruise ship horn sounds like a loud car horn.- Bad frame rate from time to time. I have a desent gameing computer and can run many games well. I have every thing reqiured to run this game properly. All though I still have bad frame rate even when my game is on the lowest settings.__________________________________________________________________________________Whats left to say about this game?This game is a huge disappointment because of the cons. It claimed to have open world and it didn't. All the cons also make this game a disapointment. Do not buy this game unless your sure you want it.Would I recommend this game?No, I would not recommend this game at all.What game would you recommend thats related to this?I would recommend Ship Simulator Extreams. From what I seen SSE is a good ship simulator that has every thing that this game doesn't. I have not played this myself but plain onto soon.__________________________________________________________________________________If you have read this review thank you for your time to read this. I hope you make the choice thats right to you what ever that choice may be."
