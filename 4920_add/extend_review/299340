It suffers from the sadly all-too-common problem of being unable to decide if it wants to be serious or funny, and in trying to do both it fails to do either.  The plot is so thin that, if it is ever discovered, will revolutionalize the world of particle physics.Glueing random stuff together to make funky spaceships seems like a winning formula and it would be if it meant anything, but it doesn't.  The glue is a system of support beams to make sure that nothing ever actually touches, so your dreams of a hodge-podge junk ship quickly dillute into a flying, 3D flowchart.The missions, combat, and trivial amount of other gameplay elements cannot hope to hide that they were all added as an afterthought to the main game, and the main game is a one-trick pony.  A gimmick.  A novel idea, sure, and one that is being used in other games out there.  But it is still just a gimmick, and gimmicks do not make for good gameplay cores.So what is there besides attaching random modules to a space station, flying it around and doing a few random things to advance the ""story?""  Well, let's list them all:So now that we're done with that list, I will conclude by saying that if this is what a ""complete"" game feels like then I give up.  This would make a fine Smartphone distraction to goof around with while sipping a beer and waiting for your date to arrive and probably worth the $5 you paid for it, in such a context.  In the context of a PC game in the 21st century?  Let me put it this way: If a good PC game is like an order of nachos deluxe with all the toppings, this is game is a few saltine crackers with some cheeze whiz on top.  Not bad as a snack, but not very filling, and certainly not a real meal."

The general idea — welding together random space junk to make a funky spaceship — is a lot of fun. But the controls are rough — you can add lots of faster engines, but you have to turn each of them on and off individually, so it makes steering and controlling your speed difficult. And when enemies attack, they don't fly in from outer space, they just appear — often in the middle of your ship! I can fight off pirates when they pull up alongside me; it's a different story when they materialize inside my ship, wiping out half of it before I can make a move. Worst of all, there's no clear way of saving the game, so you lose progress constantly. All of these issues taken together suck the fun out of what would otherwise be a terrific game."

The flight is really difficult, though made a little easier by proper booster placement and hotkey assignment. Maybe some kind of inertial dampening block would be handy to stabilise your ship. (Edit - an ""emergency full stop"" isn't really inertial dampening...)As far as the combat goes, you clumsily maneuver yourself into a position where you MIGHT be able to attack a station and then fire your lasers - the station is dead more or less immediately without putting up a fight. You then realise your next target isn't that far away, were it not for the difficulty in getting that short distance - you will spin all the way around at least 2 or 3 times. Once you're there, same story. There isn't much incentive to build beyond your initial working ship - maybe an engineer limit based on habitat pods would be more of an incentive.Oh yes, the ship will also bump into nothing, causing a change in trajectory, when you had only just got it pointing the way you wanted.Don't get me wrong, it's fun and it has a fair amount of potential but at £11 the price is much too high for a game which offers little at this stage and has no save feature.EDIT: It's worth pointing out that by now this review is fairly old and the game will continue to develop with time. I had felt that at the time my review was fair but should have been taken with a pinch of salt because I am more than aware of how games in alpha are. It is also worth keeping in mind that with early access the old ""alpha/beta"" defining lines are somewhat blurred and ""it's an alpha"" is not a blanket excuse for exclusion of basic features. This game is fun, keep an eye on it - but be aware of the limits of early development."

After playing for a while i have noticed serious gamebreaking bugs. my ships break everytime i go to lunar orbit and ship parts constantly break off for no reason when first placed as well as the worst one which does not allow me to recruit engineers but wastes the resources and stunts all my ships stats so no matter what i add on it never changes. i have tried unistalling it and starting new saves but the bugs persist.

,Not Recommended,299340,20906881,"Posted: 1 February, 2016",all,Bugz,"A year later (after my purchase) and the ""full release"" is upon us; but despite improvements it feels like nothing has changed, aside from features that I'm not sure anyone really asked for (More engineer micromanagement?  An engineer camera?).  It technically works, but still feels broken and unfinished.Even after improvements to the controls and tutorial, what systems there are in the game seem obtuse, and controlling your crafts is still too finicky and unpredictable to take seriously or strategically, and too slow and management-intensive to be silly and fun.  The constant building of your ship is equally too detail and control heavy to be light and easy, while the constant RE-building of your ship quickly saps at any enjoyment from the design and strategic planning (struts are not fun!).  Thankfully many of the tasks for the engineers are automated to some degree, but ordering them to do anything specific becomes an exercise in frustrating hunt-and-click vs the camera.It might still be worth it to pick up (on a heavily discounted sale) and play around with in the sandbox, but the campaign is a farce.  Which, considering the tone of the game and what little I was able to glean of the 'story' in-game, could actually be intentional in some brilliant meta-design by the creators, but I very much doubt that.  One can only hope that this game's developers will continue to support their game and all the promise the idea had, and perhaps reevaluate some of their design decisions.I'm incredibly bummed I can't get a refund for this.  I guess this is my own personal lesson on supporting Early Access games on faith and interest in a concept."

,Not Recommended,299340,12301513,"Posted: 30 September, 2014",all,Cecell,"I think some may misunderstand what this game really is.  A quick and dirty description of it would be an arcade game.  The game is not intended to be a long term play and you will restart the game multiple times just trying to figure out what everything does.  It isn't super intuitive which in the beginning will lead you to believe you can accomplish a number of things which will then result in you blowing up your station just because you didn't know you couldn't do that.  That kind of learning process is getting more and more common in games though (not happy about that really).  It is a good 5-60 min game that will entertain.  My rating of this game is a $4.99 game that could be worth $9.99 to someone that really likes the game.  Just remember that at $9.99 that's a roll of quarters at an arcade (i'm showing my age here).  Personally, i'd spend a roll of quarters on a different game."

That lead (in my case) to a total confusing start in the real game.Same in the 2nd tutorial ... it is a bit awkward to be shown rockets on the side and later not to know that isn't possible ... and the unlink function is disabled (aka. completely missing).There is also the issue of the camera angle ... everything in this game with this gameplay screams ""I am meant to play top down"" but the camera won't let you (probably a objection from the artist: ""but think about all those great 3D models"") ... leaving your ship in the way all the time.The other not great thing is that ship parts towed by your crew can be towedthroughyour ship ... which should be changed in later versions so that is moved under or above your ship. ... That shouldn't be too hard.The game ends up starting throwing you unprepared in middle of literally one million things from what are more than enough enemies.The circumstance that you have to do one million things and that there is no way to slow it down seems to me as preperation for making it multiplayer. But multiplayer can lead to all sorts of problems in this kind of game.So what I am missing is a third part of the tutorial in which is everything present, but no enemies ... so that you really can learn how to build and how to use the UI.Or at least an easy mode for the game ... a ""slow"" start (in which you won't encounter enemies for at least a while after starting the game) would also do."

While it may be a very simple game in its current state, with objectives able to be beaten in under an hour, it has all the basics of a game capable of being nearly as big a game as Kerbal Space Program.So what does this game currently have to offer?  Well, in its current state, not much.  I've only got around 3 hours of game time under my belt as of writing this, but that's with completing the main objectives twice and screwing around for about an hour.  There's a distinct lack of things to do right now, other than strapping debris to your ship and blowing up 5 enemies.  If you're skilled, you can actually make two ships for yourself and try running two battles at once, or fight yourself to the death.  I'm not skilled.What will definitely improve this game would be things along the line of resources that your habitat constantly consumes that you would need to replenish (which is something planned for in the future of the game).  I know the first update they're applying is going to add electricity and fuel, which will certainly make for more interesting habitat designs.One thing I've seen a lot of people complaining about is that there is a lack of a save function, with some going so far as to say that no save option is a deal breaker.  To those people, I ask: what point is there on saving a game that can be beaten in as little as half an hour?"

Habitat is about building a space station called a habitat from space junk floating around Earth. Space junk including the aforementioned Weaponized T-Rex Head, subway cars, tanks, laser cutters, and more is waiting to be combined to turn you habitat into the most badass weaponized platform in space. Once you've got all manner of weaponry, and hopefully some way to control you creation strapped together, there are enemy stations to destroy and deadly nano machine clouds to avoid. Tackling an enemy station can be handled many ways, limited only by ship design and imagination. There are plenty of ready to use weapons waiting to be attached to your habitat, or can go a little less conventional. Detaching active rocket boosters causes them to shoot off like missles, attaching a comically large boxing glove to the front of that improvised missle just makes it all the more awesome."

It is one of those time sensitive / creative types though which really dont seem to go well together. I get the need to set up your habitat on the double because it is the end times, but the nano clouds make this more of an inevitable destruction. It's  good for 30 - 40 minutes at a time, but anything after that you're going to be managing too much at once. It is kinda like going to the park as a kid and playing in the sand, then seeing you can make stuff with what is around you, then some asshat kid comes and runs right through what you were doing, you can take it out on that kid or start over, sorta thing. The weight management in zero-g is interesting, and maneurvering the structure and taking care of joints is cool. I would say if they added more consent to the game and trying to either force you to do certain things, or give more prompts when a trigger event comes up would be cool, like when a structure gets split and you have the requirements for 2 habitats. Maybe making it to where you can just have the 1 and a chunk that broke off that you can disassemble and put back together, or click a button and begin a new habitat from the broken off piece, rather than assuming they're two now.But yeah, TL;DR aside, pretty relaxing track that doesnt get on the nerves, weight management and force distribution with make-shift parts makes this easy to come back to, even though theres that fat-kid nano-cloud that comes and ruins the fun."

,Not Recommended,299340,12253009,"Posted: 26 September, 2014",all,Sandwichman,"Tl;DR (Since many of my reviews are getting longer and longer): Right now I cannot recommend this game. I like the idea, I like the mix match look to it, but right now there isn't much gameplay to review. Hold off on a purchase until they work out the kinks and whatnot.Basically what it comes down to is a 15 minute gameplay where you attach some stuff to your ship, maybe destroy another ship, and then get killed by nano clouds. There's no tutorial, it's not easy to pilot, turn or aim (which is mostly by design), and the gameplay isn't really in the game yet.I would offer at least 3 major changes right out from the get go. As I'm new to the game I'm sure the devs are probably working on it, so this can be taken with that in mind.1. Allow players to start with a set of different ships, like the statue of liberty head, space shuttle, colony, etc. but something with a basic thruster that can turn, an engineer arm (or whatnot), and some attach points.2. Missions - if even a list of little things to follow to get your ""habitat"" up and running, like attach a generator, or add a gun to protect yourself, either trade with another habitat or attack it and salvage their parts, etc.3. Tone down the comic/brightly colored stuff. I like some of the goofy stuff to it, but most of the space junk is out of place and unrealistic. If the game took a more realistic look like slavaging actual space debries like sattelites (like you already can), missles, space stations, etc it would be great. The school busses, ferris wheel, etc are completely out of place. There are some things that kinda fit, like there's an amount of goofy stuff you can deal with like the Statue of Liberty head, but in other cases it makes the game look like junk. But that is my opinion, I can see how others would really like it.I think I read that the devs are going to (or already do) allow players to make their own space junk. That would be a good idea, cause it would fix #3 for me outright if I could just check a mod site and download someone else making a realistic space junk pack.At this time the game isn't really a full enough product to really play so I don't recommend it. I have hopes that a lot of the fixes and such are just down the road, so I remain optimistic about the future of the game."

It is absolutely horrible.The tutorial explains basic movement and building, but not combat between engineers.  Sadly, the campaign quickly plunges you into combat against ""civilian engineers"" without explanation as to how to deal with them.  It's a little frustrating, to be honest.  Did I mention this game sucks?  It is absolutely abhorrent.  The designers and developers should be forced to fight each other to the death.  It would make as much sense as finding a severed chicken head on your lawn, with a note indicating ice cream was now illegal in your country.  What?  Yup, that's about as much sense as Habitat makes.This game is horrendous.  If you're thinking about buying this game, don't.  Do this instead: send an email to Steam asking them to remove Habitat from their catalog immediately.  It is absolutely criminal someone was allowed to charge money for this tripe."

Ship building was achieved by selecting parts and attaching them to other parts via a node system. So for example, you would order a Command Bridge, then attach various parts by welding the part nodes to the Command Bridge nodes. My best ships were the ones I built from submarines and girders... But sadly, those days are gone.The nodes now need to be separated by a sixty-five million mile gap (slight exaggeration) in order to be welded together. So the old ways of ship building are gone. Those submarine ships I used to build? Yeah, they were quite compact, had very small gaps between components and had quite complex welding. But they were awesome... and now they're gone.Thankfully, however, this game is still in early access, so there may still be hope. There are a few other issues as a result of the recent update in my opinion, but here's the main one - Please fix the recently-ruined node/building system!!! Please!!!"
