,Not Recommended,299460,10382986,"Posted: 7 June, 2014",all,MadFriarAvelyn,"A cheap, low-effort, unpolished platformer.  Includes six levels for you to platform around, with the main goal being to collect three tears in a level before you can exit and progress to the next level.  Other collectibles include berries, which have only two uses: unlocking achievements and buying optional weapon upgrades.  The former are useless, the latter are only debatably useful, as many enemies are easily avoidable, and in a worse case easy to dispatch with your default weapon.  To make matters worse, there are three tiers of weapon upgrades you can get.  The first one lets your leaf fire a projectile (to make dispatching the already easily avoidable enemies trivial).  The second and third?  A simple color change, and a different particle effect for the projectile you shoot.  Not worth the effort to farm the berries for them.  Because of this, the game doesn't give you much motivation to actually collect any of the (non-required) collectibles.From a gameplay perspective, the platforming isn't very tight.  Controls are often loose and slippery, which can lead to many frustrating deaths.  These deaths are made all the more frustrating with an inconsistent ""checkpoint"" system implemented in the game that randomly decides to respawn you in a fair location close to where you died, or at the start of the level.  However, once you get adjusted to this, the platforming just tends to be easy and...boring.  Even the enemies in the game present no challenge, often standing still and waiting for you to kill them.  There are maybe a half dozen enemies in the game total that provide a greater challenge of...moving in a line.  Literally one enemy in the game fires projectiles.  None of which are hard to deal with (except for the last one, which is elaborated on below).  The game does include a local co-op mode, but I fail to see a point to it, as (at least in the hub world) the second player is almost exclusively tied to the first player as the camera is locked on that player, leaving no extra incentives bring a second player as that player can't even help you explore and complete the level more quickly.From a presentation perspective, the game looks cheap: almost every object is a simple mashup of a basic 3D construct, a cube, a cylinder, or a cone, scaled to give the illusion of a more complex object.  Animations, where they exist, are usually basic looping idle, or walking animations where the models in question simply waggle their arms or legs about.  Enemies, when dispatched, often simply fall over and just...vanish.  Sometimes with a poof of (barely recognizable) smoke, and sometimes with an extra sound effect.  Textures are simplistic, often including no detail.  One shining example of this lack of detail are the levels that include a snow effect, where the snow is represented by...an extra white, untextured cube stacked on top of other level geometry.  Finally, there are some very strange camera positioning choices in the game, and since the game doesn't let you adjust your camera angle or position, can make some sections more difficult than they need to be.  Finally, the music and sound effects in the game are completely unremarkable, with the end-of-level jingle being a recording of someone mashing an out-of-tune piano.The game is also buggy.  Bugs encountered during my playthrough include: being pushed through the level geometry to my death by a moving platform, enemies that fire projectiles continuing to fire projectiles even after being killed, jumping up against the corner of certain geometry in the level causing the player character to flip upside down and become stuck, random white square appearing on the screen in the hub world (I assume these are meant to be dialog boxes of some kind, but don't display properly), camera angles often not correcting themselves when moving through a level, or after a death, and on rare occasions sticking in the pre-level cutscene position when you enter a level, rendering it unbeatable (since you can't see where your character is).  The worst offender though: the number of fruit you collect from a level doesn't reset when you exit a level unless you reset the game.  This allows you to enter a level, collect a ton of fruit, exit the level (which adds it to the total necessary for unlocking the achievements and the unlockable weapons), then re-enter the level and immediately exit to add the same amount of fruit to your total again.  You can do this non-stop to unlock all of the collectibles in the game, without even going past the first level.My final thoughts: I feel like this game was the end result of a single developer new to developing video games.  The credits back me up on this, as many of the roles listed were done by the same person, with one exception besides the special thanks section.  If I take that into account, I encourage that developer to keep writing new games, as they're moving in a step in the right direction.  But I encourage them, for future titles, to remember to make the gamplay engaging and rewarding, to make smarter game design choices in terms of controls and presentation, and to spend some extra time polishing the game and stomping out bugs.  I also recommend not trying to compare your games to, frankly superior games (such as Super Mario 64 and Banjo Kazooie, which this game was compared to), when the only similarities are you can jump and collect things.Only buy Woodle Tree Adventures if you desperately want to waste 30-60 minutes of your life, and you have literally nothing better to spend $3 on."

All the UI elements are disjointed and look out of place and poorly aligned.The controls are slippery and the actual platforming is ruined by static camera angles that are often non responsive. [ie; they get stuck at previous angles and don't update/adjust to the new setting]There are enemies, but, you're fighting the camera more often."

I didn't care about the game to be honest considering it was given out as a free key all the time, I thought it was a really rejected game so I just idled the cards. Now that I've decided to play it, considering the graphics do look very nice and cute with it's vibrant colours XDThe game's objective is very simple, you collect raindrops to finish the levels. In addition you collect berries amongst the way. There are enemies, you kill them but however no points or whatsoever is gained. Get hit and you respawn either at the start or at some point you've reach. That's basically it if you ask me. So overall, the game is VERY easy. Though, I'd say it requires some patience particularly when you're jumping from one spot to another lol.Achievements are really easy but as said, this game requires some patience so it may take time to get some of the achievements such as 3000 berries.... Unless you're very quick at collecting them. The graphics I really nice. It's simple, vibrant and looks very fun to attract the eye. The soundtrack is pleasant and soothing to listen while playing.Do I recommended this game? Yes, it may be worth the full price depending how long you spend finishing it considering the $1 = 1 hour of gameplay rule. If you're someone who got this for really cheap or a steam key like me. This game is something you would play when bored/have time to kill.So keep calm and COLLECT THEM BERRIES O____O"

Cute story for kids and people who like talking trees and magic (THE DEKU TREE)The character is floaty and hard to move most of the time and what makes it even more difficult is the awful camera angles that are nearly impossible to alter or change. The art is cute and child friendly and gives a nice warm feeling, but that soon died down when the gameplay started to show flaws.When you die from touching enemies or falling off the map you are teleported back to the starting spawn location and in some maps, that can be annoying and tedious when the camerapans down or in odd areas along with sluggish character movement. Clunky combat aswell, once you get 200 berries and upgrade to the yellow leaf, you have ranged capabilities which should be a starting trait, as mobs will touch you out of hitbox and sometimes kill you even when not in contact.Easy gameplay makes it simple to pick up or grasp for young children or inexperienced gamers. Thats a plus.For its base price of 3$ I would say save your money for something else of similar value or something in the 5$ range. I got it on sale for 0.50$ so I can't complain.Personal Rating: 2/5"
76561197989346754,Recommended,299460,10385621,"Posted: 7 June, 2014",all,Nezchan,"This could be a much better game.  The graphics are charming, the soundtrack is nicely chill and the lack of stuff like time limits is quite nice.  It's got serious potential, but a few negative aspects really work against that potential.The first and most damaging is the fact that you cannot control the camera.  In a 3D platformer where it's very easy to mis-time your jumps, that's a quick road to frustration.  Even worse, sometimes the game will change your camera angle for you, making it hard to see a jump that a moment before was perfectly visible.  Add in the fact that if the character's pack is full it enlarges so much sometimes that you have trouble seeing past it and you can see that earlier potential just start to bleed away in a flurry of missed jumps.The second flaw doesn't directly affect gameplay, but it affects immersion a lot.  That is, the character animation.  For the most part this is fine, and I really do like little touches like being able to jump until Woodle is upside-down.  Charming.  But when walking about the world, I noticed very quick that the walk animation doesn't interact at all with the ground.  The speed at which you move seems independant of the motion of the legs, giving a feel of sliding about which may not seem like a lot but since you have to look at this for the entire game, it gets a bit bothersome.  And to a degree, since you can't really tell speed from watching the character, sometimes it's hard to judge jumps and you're down into the abyss again.The third is the general lack of explanation of anything.  I've played up to where I was able to buy a second leaf mainly by accident.  I had no idea why I was supposed to gather fruits until I pretty much randomly wandered outside the house for a bit.  I'm not really sure what it does yet, since there's no explanation when you get it, so I guess trial and error?  In any case, the game doesn't really give you anything to tell you that upgrading your leaf is significant, so it almost feels like the game doesn't care.  Even a little fanfare would be nice.Overall, I'd say maybe a 6.5/10.  Barely recommend, mainly based on the remaining charm and the knowledge that updates seem to be planned.  Hopefully they'll fix some of these issues."

Cannot set controls while in game, meaning you have to guess what ""PadA"", Fire1 and StartPadX all mean while in a menu outside of the game it's self. Also there is no menu in game at all, so unless you know exactly what each item in the controls scheme is, you can't even exit the game to re-arange your controls without using your Task Manager in Windows.Also, camera control is non-existent. I adjusted controls multiple times and couldn't find a single way to move the camera manually, and the auto-camera doesn't follow well enough to warrent not being manually controlled (Literally had it at a 45 degree angle between the ground any the protagonist, obscuring my character entirely). The game also maintains a bad camera angle if at any point, you are defeated by a standard enemy."

There are a couple of complants revovling aruond the gameplay itself and one thing that might just my own opinion. The camera was just absolutely horrendous and glitched pretty much in every level and the movements were a little clunky and slippery.

The character feels slidey and it's hard to judge where you're gonna land after jumping.- Checkpoints. They either don't exist or they only work sometimes.- The jumping animation is broken. You tilt 90 degrees backwards when you jump, and if you chain it you literally start bouncing on your head.- THE NOISE. GOOD CHRIST, THE NOISE. Every time you jump or use your weapon, the character makes a really annoying noise. Picture a child saying ""heh"" while giving a short, sharp, pathetic grunt. Every. Single. Time.- You have to hold down the run button. Your finger will quickly tire.- You have to be pretty much touching enemies to kill them. 90% of the time, you either die or kill itanddie.There's probably more to it, in both pros and cons, but I couldn't bear more than 20 minutes of it.

,Not Recommended,299460,29471742,Posted: 24 January,all,Audish,"Woodle, woodle, now that's a funny word. It refers to your little tree stump character that you'll be hopping and scrambling all over creation with, and it's an appropriately adorable name for an adorable little fellow. I could say the same for the rest of the game, that it has a simple, even precious charm to it. Unfortunately that's about all I can say about it without digging into all the parts that are lacking, so before I do that, let's just enjoy that title a little more. Woodle.Woodle Tree Adventures opens with a great mustachio'd tree raising you whole from the earth and commanding you to bring water to the land. This is accomplished by traveling to six different worlds, finding the three giant fairy teardrops floating around, and taking them to the three giant Dixie cups at the end of the level. Along the way you can collect piles of berries that unlock new items for you, as well as a gaggle of precious and mostly passive monsters to maybe get in your way.The colorful screenshots might hearken to mind Mario 64 or any of his other 3D outings, and that's not too far from the mark. Each of the six levels is a mass of blocks and platforms floating in a vast blue sky, and you have full range of moment to scamper about them, hoovering up berries and droplets. Your woodle dude has none of the fancy moves that Mario has trained up over the years, just run, jump, and bat things with his leaf. That's plenty to get through the different worlds of forests and beaches and ice and bees, because there are no puzzle elements or secrets to speak of.This is where the game starts to show how thin it is, because each level is exactly what it says on the tin. 100 berries and 3 droplets, and you only need the droplets to win. The berries are added up at your house between levels and unlock new leaves to swing, but all the three fancy leaves do are let you shoot an air gust different distances. There's also a bandanna that's just for show and a seventh world you need 600 berries to access, but that doesn't mean you need to find every berry. No, every time you replay a level you can collect all the berries again, so if you were so inclined you could grind out all the unlocks on the very first level (do not do this). And once you beat the sixth world, you get a THANKS FOR PLAYING screen and that's it.There's not going to be much reason to run around in the game beyond finishing it because the basic elements are just as threadbare. The platforming is stiff in its physics and sticky in how you get stuck on edges and walls. Animations are incredibly basic, rendering combat nothing more than waving a leaf and watching enemies slowly fall over with a sad bloop. There's literally no UI so forget about keeping track of the berries you found, and no camera controls so enjoy 3D platforming from a fixed angle. The camera thing is particularly damning because there are triggers around the levels that flip it to side or overhead angles but don't flip it back when you leave the area, so if you take an unlucky fall you might be doing a 3D jumping section from a profile view.I had high hopes for Woodle Tree Adventures based on how cute and platformy it looked, but it plays more like a proof of concept than a finished game. There's not even a pause menu for cryin' out loud, just a splash screen with the controls and a button prompt to quit the game. It's a title that's very clearly the work of one developer, and while it's a great accomplishment in that respect it's still lacking the quality of a retail product. I'd love to see a sequel with more polished movement, more professional graphics (and sound, some of the piano tracks kill me), and just more to do. There is actually a sequel, but from the looks of it none of those improvements have been made. So sorry, little friend woodle... your name is a winner but your game really isn't.Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them athttps://goldplatedgames.com/or on mycuration page!"

Jumping forward is too powerful, you jump forward at a constant speed but its a speed faster than the walking speed so frequently I fall off platforms and I don't feel like it's my fault that I did.You control the movement of the character 100%, there's no momentum, no slow down if you jump in one direction and then decide to change directions mid air.The camera controls badly, i can't look around the level easily to tell if i still have to collect items there - to waste time getting back up. You can zoom the camera in and out but you cant use it to look up over the character or back behind him easily, Like I want to zoom out so I can see the depth better of where I have to pick♥♥♥♥♥♥up but then it just zooms out - there's no limit on zoom btw it goes out forever if you want.The attack range is so small hard to see, but you die in one hit. If you hit an enemy he doesnt go away for a moment so if you hit him and then run into him you die instantly anyway.The item pickup hitbox seems too small because I've gone through objects without picking them up.It's hard to tell depth in the game maybe partly because half of the object textures are flat colours. There's moments where you have to jump to the side of the screen in the unknown because the camera won't look there, and there turns out to be an enemy so you die instantly - this fills me with hate.The axis of motion is weird, it seems like it limits you to degrees of 5 around in the circle of 360, and not full 360, so your character jitters around as it turns and it feels bad.The character's backpack becomes more full the more you pickup objects, so full sometimes you can't see past it.I wish there was at least jumbled talking for voices for characters, it felt like the music was getting very repeaty, the sound of the waterfall cuts off before it loops again every 4 seconds, it felt like the world was not alive even as simply stylised as it was."

For older folks, this would either be a cutesy little way to pass the time, or a simple and sweet nostalgic throwback to the very basics of platforming, with a colourful 3D twist.The game is designed with very bright colours and simple geometry in mind, with a very clear resembelence to young childrens media. It's not a hard game, even for a non gamer, but for a young child this would be a great way to start an enjoyable gaming path. You basically play as a cute little tree stump, collect berries, and gather 3 tears to go onto the next level, and it's wrapped into a very adorable, brightly coloured package.

Also they all only take one hit even the big ones. An achievement similar to the 1'000 berries one could also remedy this nicely)-Collecting berries after a while feels pointless (Could use an in level counter in one of the corners to show how many you've accumulated. Also berries really aren't used for much except for unlocking a couple levels and items)-Exploration should be rewarded (A lot of times I'd find a secret little area and everytime I'd think it would be great if there was something here even if it was just an extra berry)-Weapon upgrades don't feel very noticeable (Yes your projectile goes farther but all the creatures only take one hit to kill)-Controls feel a little slippery and the world feels weightless making it hard to gauge where exactly you'll land when jumping. (Aside from a few clumps Woodle really has no effect on the enviroment)-Could use more levels-Boss fights wouldn't hurtIf I had to describe Woodle Tree Adventures in a word it'd be: complex. WTA is a short 3-D collect-a-thon platformer (reminiscent of Mario 64 and Banjo Kazooie) as much as it is a coming of age story. I won't get into the meat of the story but Woodle is sent on a life threatening quest to gather the fabled Fairy Tears and a crap ton of berries all while  trying to prove himself to his Father the Deku Tree. In this quest he encounters terrifying enemies such as Caterpillars, Candy Corn People and a couple really tall guys. There are 6 different levels rich in colour and interesting in design, as well as a few unlockable weapons (Although the don't differ much, I actually still have no idea what the headband does.) You can also bring a buddy along as a beaver to help you collect your berries. On the surface WTA is a cute platforming adventure you can waste a couple hours in, but at it's core WTA is a deep philosophical journey and a look at today's society as a whole. You collect berries monotonously as an allegory for everyday life, there are also underlying themes of surpassing your elders and whether giving up on your dreams to take up their mantle is the right choice.In the end though there are a lot of things wrong with WTA and a lot of things right I have to give it a 6/10. I hope a Woodle Tree  Adventures 2 is in the works and if so the developer takes my criticisms to heart."

It does have a very cute presentation, and the whole game is very family friendly.  Many of the enemies don't even really seem interested in attacking you.  Think of it as a cuter, cheaper Mario 64 Lite.That being said, if you are an adult I would not waste your time on this one.  The camera is awful and cannot be adjusted.  The control scheme is awful and cannot be adjusted in the options.

Basically, this is a budget Mario 64, that lacks depth and story. Aside from that, the controls are cohesive and the game is simplistic and decently playable. The biggest problem is the camera, since it often locks in a position that is difficult to see where you are going and sometimes even reverses the point of view, often causing you to die as a result.As a $3 game, I would say look for a better use of your money.

The game is $3 and $2 when on sale (Sometimes even $1.50) So the way this should be viewed is that you are donating the money for the group to one day make a game they can be proud of. If Woodle had a large group working on it then I think it would be like any simple platformer without the flaws, a cute style and a cute character.

You play as a little cute tree stump that walks around and picks up cherries and water drops. Not very hard to do, so the game keeps a casual style.As for the actual visual appearance of the game, it is very fascinating. The graphics are cartoony, but still maintain a very beautiful and eye catching style! You can't find worlds that look like this in other games. The worlds themselves are very detailed, and unique from each other. They may be short, but you still have a lot to do.In terms of unlockables, you can upgrade your leaf to have more range and power, as well as unlock a cool little headband that doesn't do anything but just generally looks cool on your head. Pretty fun extra feature!The music is probably one of the best parts of the game. Its very beautiful, and suits the environments very well. It sticks in your head for a while and also has the tendency to really relax you and make you feel very good while you play the game.And about the camera, it isn't really that big of a deal. The game is still very playable, and the camera is not a huge annoyance factor. I have no idea why people are complaining so much about it, I mean it could have been better but the game is still playable.So overall, do I recommend the game? Definitely.

The Fairy tears are spread across the land and are proven to be a powerful addiction for some of the enemies, corrupting them and tearing their lives apart. You, as the brave woodle assassin must save your father's fallen kingdom by murdering Snowy enemies and collecting berries to build up your resources.During your adventure you will find many evil beings who have been corrupted by the fairy tears for example, a group of satan worshipping white dots that wear candy corn hats and a green apple man who (due to childhood abuse and drug problems) chases after you until he falls over and starts crying. There is an octopus that mistakes you for your father and yells at you because your father murdered his family years ago. Later in the game you encounter a small group of sugar cubes wearing yellow diapers that walk in circles. If you walk up to them you will notice that they are just enjoying their day. The game leaves you with a choice of either to attack them or leave them be. If you choose to murder them, they will fall to the ground crying ""Why are you hitting me?!"" Your character picks up his metal leaf and shoves it down his throat. This was possibly the most graphic scene in the game in my opinion. You continue through the game stealing food and murdering your fathers enemies.The end of the game is a final battle with the mob boss named ""Woodlbeevur"" who murders your father with an axe and continues to try to attack you. (Spoilers) To beat this boss you must gather all of the Fairy tears and throw them and Woodlbeevur until he drops to the ground crying. Then you must rip his head off of his body and place it above your fireplace back at your woodle house. The final scene in the game shows you (The woodle assassin) crying over your father's grave and screaming ""WHY?!"" as the game slowly fades to black. The credits roll in to a fantastic soundtrack overture, showing all of the hard work put into this masterpiece until the credits end on ""Follow me on twitter!"" with no escape other that force quitting the game leaving you (The player) to decide what happens next. Does it represent the unescapable forces of life its self? Or does it represent the depression in murder and the consequences of disobeying the law. Truly something to think about for an eternity.This is not a game,  this is an experience. The open world is as large as GTA V or Fallout 3 and the story is as rich as The Last of Us.

,Recommended,299460,18829171,"Posted: 1 November, 2015",all,Windows Movie Maker 1998,"Have you ever noticed how, in a typical RPG (and, now that I think about it, most games in general) battles don’t really mean anything? How many times have you defeated a miniboss, only to have it stand back up and laugh at you, saying “I have underestimated you! You are a worthy opponent! This is not the end! We shall meet again!” and make a getaway? Think about it. How many times do you beat up Balrog in Cave Story only to have him fly away without a scratch? How is Black Knight able to keep running away after Shovel Knight stabs the hell out of him? How come you black out if you lose a Pokémon battle, but none of the other trainers do? And how does the big bad villain always seem to get away, even if their HP hits zero, so they can reappear in the sequel?Woodle Tree Adventures asks the question, “What if defeating an enemy in battle always means that they die?”This might seem quite inconsequential in random encounters, but Woodle Tree Adventures will also pit you against several main characters. If you defeat a main character in battle, they’re dead for good, and the whole story changes to reflect it. Heavy stuff.But thankfully, as the game advertises, you don’t actually have to kill anyone! The game offers a second option to get out of battles: talking the enemy out of fighting. This involves solving a simple puzzle, almost always involving the “Act” menu in battle. The puzzle changes depending on what kind of enemy you’re fighting; sometimes you’ll just need to give them a compliment, other times you’ll need to survive several of their attacks, and so on. Once they’re not emotionally invested in the battle anymore, you can “spare” them, and the battle ends. You won’t get any EXP for it, but you’ll still get gold. It’s a very unique fighting mechanic!I admit, after my first playthrough of the game, I was disappointed in the story’s presentation. I thought that both the very beginning and the final area of the game were fantastic, dripping with shocking emotional dilemmas, but the middle 80% of the game’s content seemed like it relied too much on oddball humor and not much else. The game hilariously plays with expectations and has no shortage of genuinely witty satire of its genre, and I found myself amused by nearly all of it, but after the first two hours as I was walking across long linear worlds and listening to dozens of characters try to tell me jokes, I started to wonder where the emotional gravity had gone. “Why is this game making me laugh, when I thought it was supposed to make me cry?” I asked myself. “Where are the feelings? After such an excellent and powerful prologue, why is the game taking so long to show me more?”Later that night, as I was lying awake in bed, the answer hit me: the game was quirky and lighthearted because I was sparing everyone’s life. I wasn’t playing as a murderer. If you want this game to have drama, you have to cause it. And I think that’s where all the hype is coming from, all the talk about player choice. This is a game about being a tree-hugging pacifist, or a murderous psychopath who kills anyone who gets in the way, or anything in between. You only need to live with whomever you decide to be, because the game won’t let you ignore what you have done.Though it isn’t the most visually impressive game, and the stage design isn’t always the best, Woodle Tree Adventures has left me feeling that I have just witnessed a work of art. It tried some new and ambitious things and isn’t ashamed of what it wanted to be. It's about 6 hours long; I’d recommend anyone to play it at least twice, just to be able to say that they've made their own choices and seen what the game has to offer. It’s hard to imagine that anyone would regret the experience."

Having said that, I am a 28yo female and I still found it quite amusing ^.^ Its a nice change of pace from Darks Souls / Smite etc ""serious"" games. This game is serious as well. But it's comparatively easier.- The enemies don't respawn, they have a decent variety and types, some are passive, some are just objects and some are aggressive. They are easy to defeat if you get the timing right. There's sufficient time to correct a mistake but they're not so easy that you can keep whacking the attack and get away with it.- There are check points which are far enough from where you died to still maintain the platforming challenge but not too far to make it annoying.- The level design is nice. It has different features and the game overall is quite creatively made.- The camera is scripted but you can move it and enjoy the game. This game requires patience, and I mean that in a good way. When you arrive on a platform, take your time to judge where things are before leaping. I think its a good lesson for kids (and even some adults)- Graphics are nice and cute.- Soundtrack is nice too, this game isn't meant to be played for hours on end consecutively, if you keep your playtime limited to a level, it won't annoy you.- You can't skip through / speed up dialogues (probably intended as a reading excericse maybe?)Overall - 8 / 10.STILL A BETTER COMBAT SYSTEM THEN ALL OF ASSASIN'S CREED NOOB FRIENDLY GAMES.[\h1]"

Local cooperative play makes this a worthy addition to my library even though it's not the type of game I would play by myself. The only issue I have with it so far is that the camera angles sometimes throw off my depth perception.

Is it good? Is it bad? The thing is, Woodle Tree Adventures knows what it's going for; a 3D platformer. But the games fatal flaw is how the camera ""sometimes"" goes where you want it to be. It's almost random. Other than the camera, I found one flaw having to do with respawning after dying to an enemy or a pit. Sometimes (there's that word again) you respawn around where you died. Sometimes you respawn near what I would guess is a checkpoint. But sometimes, you get sent all the way back to the beginning of the stage. Normally, I wouldn't have a problem with that. But the lack of knowing where you will end up is just...jarring in a sense! The level design for the game is...okay. I like it (Especially the technical 3rd and 4th stages). For music...there isn't a whole lot from what I've seen. Nothing too catchy. The music is just...okay also. Lastly, where this game shines the most: graphics. The game is very colorful and very pretty to look at. Some shapes and models seem a bit bland, but it just seems to ""work"". It all pieces together this Mario 3D Land-esque experience. Except involving trees. All in all, I recommend this game if you feel like checking it out. Just be prepared for an imperfect experience. The game's not bad. But it's not amazing by any means, it could use a bit more work in my opinion, but just a teensy-tiny bit. Other than that, it's a fun game. It is enjoyable, colorful, and there are trees in it! But I can't end this review without mentioning one possible glitch/intentional mechanic: When you are jumping on stairs or hitting your head against a block, you will occasionally flip backwards and jump on your head. This doesn't change the gameplay at all, it's just that your model will be upside-down for as long as you are continuously jumping. But anyway, that wraps up my first review ever. I thought I just had to explain my thoughts about this game to the Steam Community. Due to it's obscurity and imperfections. In any case, I give this game a 3 out of 5. It looks good. It plays okay. The sound design is meh. But the reason it's just over the halfway mark from 1 to 5; is because it is fun."

This game changed a six year old's idea of games. It went from ""Lets go down stairs and play Wii!"" into ""Can I play Woodles with you on your computer?""If you play massive and popular games like Pay Day or Call of Duty this isn't for you. This is cutesy and adorable. Camera can glitch but consider it part of the challenge to the game. Its not challenging and its relaxing to not get frustrated. The cute basic storyline, the cute characters and ""bad guys"" and the maps make the game funThough the campaign was short and there wasn't a whole lot to the game it worked in its favor.

The player can only zoom in and out, and sometimes the game decides to rotate the camera on its own. In various levels this makes the perception of depth really difficult.No constant respawning. Sometimes you'd respawn at the beginning of the level, sometimes halfway, or sometimes somewhere completely different.Levels seemed unfinished at times, especially when zoomed out.The different leaves don't really seem to change much other than the initial ranged attack upgrade you get with the orange leaf.Unable to complete all achievements if you only have one Xbox 360 controller or never have friends over.Keyboard controls are awful. Arrows for movement, shift for run, spacebar for jumping and thenE for attack?No remapping either!Conclusion:For the 1 buck I bought it for it was a somewhat alright game, but very frustrating due to the various cons. I got all the achievements other than the ""play with your friend"" one, because I only have one x360 controller and I never have friends over.

It's quite a short game, I've just beaten it in one sitting. But I didn't expect it to be very long. It's a cute game with bright colors and peaceful (albeit often unfitting) music. There are, however, a few problems with the game. The main problem, which you will notice right away, is how the camera works. It's very situational. It can give you a nice angle at times, but others it'll make it rather difficult to tell where you're going to land when you jump. The second problem, which is the one that annoyed me the most, is this: When you walk or run off the edge of a platform, no matter what, you will perpetually move in the direction you were facing until you either hit the ground or fall to your death. It's a very annoying bug that can easily ruin the fun.But again, I can look past these problems since I've only paid 5 cents. The game gets much easier once you upgrade your leaf, since you obtain a projectile attack and don't have to get so close to enemies. Do check it out."

This game, ''Woodle Tree Adventures'' can easily compete with AAA titles like The Witcher 3, which I simply adore. The only thing this game lacks is a sequel. A bigger, better sequel worth 10 cent instead of 5. Something that will just sweep the opposition from the face of our very earth.If you have any doubts - don't.

,Not Recommended,299460,17747256,"Posted: 27 August, 2015",all,Double Uppercut,"Oh my... Where does one even begin with Woodle Tree Adventures? I think someone left me a Christmas gift early, because I love tearing the crap out of these horrible games! I got this game purely because my mate told me that it was a horrible game, and I looked at the trailer and screenshots and thought, ""Oh. It can't be that bad! It looks like a fun little casual game!"" So when it went down to $.35, I decided to check it out, and oh... my god. My mate was so very right. This game is just awful. Don't be fooled by the cute and nice-looking graphics, this game is one of the worst games you can get on Steam! Not as bad as Ankh or Kane and Lynch, but I'd still avoid this game, crucifix clutched in my hand.The biggest problems from Woodle Tree Adventures spawn mainly from the level design. It's really crappy. The first level is direct enough for you to know what paths of the level veer off a tad so you can grab the three magic tears (whatever the hell they are), and still make it to the end with all three and not have to back-track. All the other levels are the exact opposite. The design is so vague, that you end up just casually walking down one of the branching paths, thinking you'll find a tear, but end up finding the three tear basins and having to go all the way back to where you came from, which can be a real annoyance.The platforming in this game is also very rough. The camera locks in this strange position that tries to make it look like a Mario-style side-scroller, but it's very clear precisely where you need to land, and the way the camera is locked will often have you missing and falling to your death (or even worse... walking all the way back up to try again!) And if it isn't the camera that will be hindering you from making that jump, it'll be the actual ruddy jump itself! Woodle Tree (I think that's the protagonist's name. I'd preferably call him Wooden S.O.B.) handles about as clunky as a metal trashcan with pots and pans strapped to it and about as slippery as a slightly dried banana. His jump can very from just-the-right-height to completely-off depending on whether Woodle feels like it or not (Sprinting usually helps. Sometimes.) And he also slides just a little, so if you're planning on landing on that very small platform... you'll be doing that jump at least five more times till Woodle can keep his bloody feet actually on it.The lack of HUD can make the game feel even more vague. Collecting berries often seemed like a fruitless task without showing a little number up on the screen. So I'd have to keep turning off the game then back on, to go back to Woodle's house and see the actual number. ""But why would you need berries?"" you may ask, potenial buyer. ""F*** if I know!"" I'd reply, ""I just get them because there's nothing else to do!"" You need berries because if you get so many... you get a new leaf! Specifically, if you get up to 800 berries, you get a yellow, orange, and white leaf. And what do they do? Exactly the same thing! They blast a thingy that kills an enemy from the distance. The only thing that actually changes is the shape of the projectile and it's color. Personally, I think the change is asinine, as the green leaf can kill literally ANY enemy in one swipe. That's what I call real challenge right there! If you get 850 berries (which is a very odd number, in retrospect) you get a bandana. ""Why would you want a bandana?"" you may ask again. ""F*** if I know!"" I'd repeat, ""But it looks cool when you jump!""And, again, if you think those graphics look so cute.... you'll be having seconds thoughts when you play the game- as it tends to make a lot of... mistakes. The animations are way off- particularly on Woodle. When he turns, he does it so exact. Like a computer program being told turn precisely ninety degrees left. It just seems unnatural and bothers me. Woodle's feet also glide off the ground when he walks, and when he jumps... he can oftentimes nearly stick his feet all the way up in the air- doing a 180 and back before landing on a platform three feet higher than them. Woodle, as you may assume, is very agile- of course. There's also this weird enemy who walks on these long legs like he has Monkey Butt, and when you kill him, it almost looks like he was blasted back by a rocket onto his tuchas. Another graphical problem is Woodle's berry bag. The more berries you pick up, the bigger it gets. But the bigger it gets- the more it turns into a balloon encompassing the space around it, whether it be a wall nearby or Woodle himself.You'd think there'd be more intelligent thought put into this game. Like maybe, the more berries you get the better. But it'll weigh you down, as your bag gets more full. Or the water may push you back towards the edge a little as you walk through it (instead of pathetically slowing you down). Or maybe there would be platforms that fall out as you stand on them longer. Or maybe if you die, you go back the start (as WTA has trouble remembering where to respawn you whenever you die. Sometimes I'd end up at the start, sometimes I'd end up five feet from where I died), and lose some of your berries. But that's far too challenging for a game like this! So the developers just tones and dumbed everything down into a monotonous mess that feels far longer than the 100 minutes I spent beating the story and getting the 850 berries (because there's no way in hell I'm going for that 3000 berry achievement). And yeah, the story is simple and sparse. Get tears, a tree with a beard is happy. The end.This game is bad in terms of graphics, sound, design, and story. The only slightly redeeming element would be the graphics since for the duration of the game they do look nice. But everything else in this game is just so poorly done, it drags down the whole experience until you're done the game and you realise how many precious minutes you've wasted by staring at a screen, bored. The screen looks nice, though"

Often times I was stuck somewhere just because the camera chose the most inappropriate angle for the situation.Secondly, the controls are extremely clunky almost to the point where the game is completely unplayable. What's more the game displays the depth pretty inaccurately. At some points I couldn't make a jump because I thought i was at the same level as the platform (although this may be caused by the poor camera angles).The game just feels unfinished. I am really sad to say this, as I saw some potential in it.

I'd prefer if I could actually control the camera beyond zooming in and out, especially when I fall off a cliff and the camera stays the way it was facing when I fell off. The lack of checkpoints is alright since you have unlimited lives so it has a very relaxed feel to it. Speaking of relaxed feels, the music is pretty calming, and I could easily see it being on one of those meditation mix tapes that old women use. That being said, the music and sound effects could use a bit of a volume raise, cause they're really quiet. The best way I can describe this game is a poor man's version of Super Mario 64, or maybe Super Mario 3D World, since that's the way the levels are structured.It's at times like this I wish Steam allowed you to do a middle option rather than a thumbs up or down, because I'd say this game is worth getting on the cheap end of things, and will probably tie you over till the Beta for A Hat in Time comes out."

However, this game goes a little TOO far in some aspects as a copycat. There is absolutely no camera control, meaning those picture-perfect jumps are going to be a stretch. I will give it this, though- the graphics are adorable and seem to have been crafted with an early generation PSX or N64 game in mind. But beyond that...this game needs work. And lots of it. I wouldn't reccomend it...not even at its low asking price. I would wait until patches come out to fix the lag, add camera control and perhaps tighten the character controls a little."

First of all, there is no ""health"" bar, so whenever you TOUCH a monster you have to restart at the last checkpoint. Second of all, these checkpoints aren't marked so you cannot tell if you made it to a checkpoint or not. You also cannot move around your POV so it's always stuck at default. Because of this, your body is sometimes (most of the time) blocked by something, or it is hard to see yourself in a comfortable way. I hope that this game soon gets updated because it would bring SO much more attention to it."

This is something Nintendo improved after noticing this problem in Super Mario 64.I like that they don't have lives.  This saves a lot of frustrations.However, don't like the system that you get killed when you get hit by an enemy once.

There is no punishment for dying and enemies don’t appear to attack player 2 and to top it off the camera does not share with player 2 and just focuses on player 1. Perhaps that’s one of the elements taken from 90’s gamesNot a bad point but just a heads up that a playtime is around 1 hour.Overall after completing the game it feels like it's in early betaI can’t really complain much since the game only cost £1.50 but this is what I think."

Why is something this stupid an issue in this day & age? Spare yourselves the annoyance. Spend your money elsewhere.Do you enjoy knowing where you exist in space & time? Woodle Tree does not think the gamer should have this luxury.If the camera isn't bad enough on it's own. The more you die or even make use of the camera, it bugs out & comes off of it's tracks. Sometimes locking into a zoomed in overhead view. Other times the camera completely flips around & you see everything from the back of the stage.

I had it in my wishlist for a while and purchase it in a bundle with Woodle Tree Adventures 2. It's a simply platformer but very enjoyable depending on the type of gamer you are. Me being a gamer, I'm open to any game that interests me, it just needs to be fun. I did have fun playing this game, and I felt rather relaxed playing it too, mostly due to the the impressive soundtrack and level design, My only problem with this game however is it's respawn system and what I mean is when you reach block B from block A. If you die father from block B, you'll respawn back to block B, but if you die closer to it, or just fell it cause the edges are very slippy and you can fall off easily if you by the edge. You'll spawn back to block A, which made the game more challenging and kept me on my toes. The story was straight forward, and what some could say basic. But I felt like the gameplay itself helps explains the story more when you playing it. I would give this game a 9/10 and I even found myself revisiting it just to play again."

They arose from the muck with god-like grace, elevating through the different layers with precision, and class.I gave my character a name, that name being 'Swiss ♥♥♥♥e Roll', as it resembled a pile of dark foeces mixed with the baked treat, the 'Swiss Roll'. When he rose, he was facing an indian punk-rock formation, with orange skin, a macho-man moustache, fat eyebrows, and eyes so black they consumed the soul of everything for miles around.It appears he'd mutated into some sort of solitary structure resembling a tree; his arms once flailing in agony as he'd been stuck in the brown slop, had grown 'leaf' cubes, and had branched off when his fingers bent and moved as his body siezed into its position. His legs, frozen in the ground, broke into fragments, digging into the slop also, locked in time as it were.My character stood deadly still, very slightly swaying in fear at the monstrosity that lay before it.Then, the Indian Punk-Rock Tree Man spoke.""How are you, my little son"" My character became alerted that I was the demon-spawn of this creature, and tensed up even more-so than before. Their face, my face, was locked with fear, but my character could not express their pain, as their mouth had not been created by this.. this demon of a tree..The Punk-Tree told me my task in this world; to collect the tears of Etheopian children, and put them in a sack resembling a fat american's backside, contained in a pair of stictched up jean leggings, or 'Jeggings'.This Punk-rock Indian Tree malformation then showed me how to do my task. He moved me towards one of the tears, me wailing and protesting behind the comfort of my monitor. I was in agony watching my character move to sieze one of the poor children's tears.Once he had forced me to collect these tears, he used his voodoo indian magic to teleport me further into his demon realms, and showed me a gothic hut he'd created for me. Inside, he showed me the Jegging bag in which I was to collect the Etheopian children's tears, and then he presented me with a contraption only a mind as evil as this Punk-Demon Tree could think of; A leaf for hitting things with.My character could not express their emotion upon seeing this leaf, as the creator had not given me a mouth to utter pleas. Pleas for my character to not have to endure this task of heresy.10/10, would meme agen.My character was then forced to hit a voodoo-magic orb, upon which he was sent into the wide world to smack things with his leaf, and collect the frosty cold tears of the Etheopian Children."

You can only bring the camera closer and farther from your person in terms of manual control.Second of all, the music sounds like something that plays in the background of an educational video from the early 90's. Solid material for some vaporwave remixes, if that's your thing.Lastly, the game is disgustingly brief. To beat all the levels and collect all the upgrades took me roughly an hour, and that was me taking my time. Lord knows I can't make this thing go up to two hours of total playtime, so at least it is easy to refund if you want your spare change back.Woodle Tree Adventures is cute, and a simple 3D Platformer on Steam, and that's about all it has going for it.

The controls are simple, and the gameplay feels like an old-school 3D platformer.The most damning feature is one that it lacks: camera controls. You can zoom in and out, but without rotating camera controls, this game will feel like it's ♥♥♥♥ing you with a cactus while using ghost pepper sauce as lube.Another miss with this game is the lack of a life system. It felt like I was playingI Wanna Be The Babbymore than a platforming game. On that same front, the respawn points were without precedent. You die from an enemy: back to the beginning of the stage. You fall off the map, you go back near where you fell. It was all over the place.Despite all that, I still foundWoodle Tree Adventuresa little fun. For $0.59 on sale, it's worth a cheap thrill.
