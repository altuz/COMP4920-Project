76561198019258496,Not Recommended,299500,15752812,"Posted: 9 May, 2015",all,Mr. D,"This is not a game I can honestly recommend with a clear conscience, although people looking for a Snooker simulation on Steam are going to find their options sorely limited; this is in fact the only one, but there are so many things that don't feel right with this game.The AI difficulty can vary wildly within the same match, and even within the same frame, going from missing shots you'd think were unmissable to clearing the table unless you snooker your opponent on the break. The AI has no concept of shot selection either - in one example, the computer opponent had potted a red and ended up in the jaws of the middle pocket, completely unable to see pink and black. He them promptly nominated black (despite having an easy blue he could drop in to the opposite middle) and proceeded to play the cue ball directly into the jaw of the middle pocket, sending it careering around the table and missing everything. This happened 3 times in a row, at which point I was awarded the frame. Laughably bad.Michaela Tabb, bless her heart. She's a good referee and a likable character on the Snooker and Pool circuit, but there's no visual representation of her in-game at all; she's been reduced to a disembodied voice with about as much emotion in her tone as GLaDOS in Portal. In some instances, the game doesn't even get the scores right - on more than one occasion, I've potted a red, followed by a pink (for a break of 7), only for the game to proudly announce that I'm on a break of 6. The only thing stopping poor Michaela from turning in her grave is that she isn't actually dead.Sending the cue-ball in-off is a common occurrence, but one that seemingly happens at random, completely irrespective of how careful or otherwise you're playing. There is no consistency with shot power, with a 100% power shot sending the cue ball all the way around the table twice, but a 40% power shot is rarely enough to even pot the black off its spot.Animations of the crowd clapping are horribly and obviously looped, the player character is never seen and has no character model, so you can forget about character customisation aside from the name, and the opposing player is only ever seen sat down at the side of the table while you make your break. Obviously it was too much to ask to animate a model of someone walking around a snooker table and playing a shot.If you want a good snooker game on the PC, avoid this and buy Virtual Pool 4, which has a fantastic snooker game mode."

But if you enjoy snooker as a spectator this is a great game.Although it lacks the humour and feel of old time (Archer Maclean) classics like Jimmy White and Pool, it's still a solid representation of the game of snooker.Personally, I don't feel that the physics are wrong, the cushions and pockets feel (to me) like they should and are a close approximation of a real ""fast"" table.I like that you can drop in and out of tournaments and that you can speed up the play of AI opponents.I'm not that fond of the woman they got to do the voice overs inbetween frames, but it serves a purpose I suppose.All in all it's an excellent and very playable snooker game and I'm glad I purchased it."

Having said that I'm getting breaks just above the 50 mark which is exactly how I fare in the real game. I like the career mode with the easy early rounds and then tough opponents later on. The AI is OK. Let's face it the computer could play a perfect game every time so it has to be dumbed down, mostly you don't notice. Sometimes it reminds me of early games with my Dad, when he would throw a few shots so I could get some table time. Cue ball action is a little unpredictable but you can mostly get the position you were aiming for.There are significant problems with the Miss Rule (almost like real life). Your AI opponent will never put you back in, no matter how poor their position is. Also the AI will happily throw away a frame, or even a match, with three misses in a row.I like the crowd noises. The oohs and ahhs, the coughing and the occasional ""Go on my Son"" add to the atmosphere. It's a shame they didn't record more variations with Michaela Tabb, she has a gorgeous Scottish accent but sometimes sounds like a robot or answering machine because of overused words.I've had a great time with this game and it cost me less than a pound in a bundle."

This game is really so close to the real thing that is unbelievable. Unfortunately, a lot of flaws still exists in the game. I have found the AI players to lack vision in certain respects, some are programmed to be over 100% which makes them impossible to beat. They can also sometimes make the strangest shot selections and are very limited when snookered close behind another ball.My biggest criticism of this game lays in the multiplayer. It does not show all the names of players entering and also tend to lose connection at awkard times.What a pity that the developers do not have money to update the game properly  ( according to Big Head Games spokesman ) in an email to me recently.Maybe they should also be looking at a crowd funding solution so that we can all enjoy the game more.There are various other problems that can easily be rectified by a good programmer.I am therefore calling on Big Head Games to react to this review and tell us what you have in mind for this game.To make money, you must invest in this game and I am sure that the profits will exceed your wildest imagination.I am running a snooker league with this game, but in order to progress, the game MUST be updated.Sincerely yours.Christie Geldenhuys"

But there a few things to note. First off you are probably going to want to leave the aiming guides turned on. This isn't cheating, it just compensates for the lack of depth perception that is inherent in virtual pool games, at least until there is a version that uses the oculus. If you stick to playing in first person it gives a fairly realistic feel and balance to the game. If you turn them off then you end up playing nearly every shot from the overhead camera view which makes if feel like an 8-bit arcade game. Also lining up the shots in the overhead view without the guides is so frustrating that you'll find yourself moving your head to strange angles and spending a few minutes on every shot to try and find the right line, only to miss by an inch or two anyway. Changing to the overhead view at all could be considered cheating but it is the only way to get a overview of the layout since you can't walk around the table while playing, something that I found lacking. There are also shots where the pool cue completely obstructs the view while in first person, which is odd since a little tranparency would have been an easy fix here. Changing to the overhead view is a must in this case.To play you set the desired spin, cue angle and power level before clicking on a button to fire the shot. A mouse driven cue and power action is sorely missed here. Coupled with the guides it takes nearly all of the interactive feel of the game away. However, since spin, power and cue ball placement are so important in the game of snooker it still has its merits as a tactical game or training aid.As mentioned in other reviews, the AI is inconsitent because they will play poorly for half a game and then trot out a break of 50 or more at the end. I also feel guilty when snookering the opponent since in many cases they will miss, at least in the early stages of a tournament, and it is so easy to force them to replay the shot and win the frame by default after the third miss. They simply don't change the shot they attempted the first time.I'd recommend the game to anyone with a passion for snooker but I'd be raving about the game if these points were addressed. As it stands I'll just have to repeat that it is a good game with a fair price and great graphics."

I certainly wouldn't pay its current full price of $13, though. Having only ever played pool before, snooker was an interesting change. After learning the basics of snooker quite easily from the game, I'll borrow the sage words from the cover of an Othello box to describe it: A minute to learn, a lifetime to master.Pros:+Easy to learn game with simple rules+Simple, easy to understand interface+Varying levels of opponent skill. Sometimes the round is really easy, sometimes really hard. A healthy dose of both throughout each tournament to keep it interesting.+Other billiards type games when snooker gets to be a bit boringCons:-Multiplayer is absolutely broken. Tried to connect 15 times, succeeded 3 times. If you want to buy this game for the multiplayer experience, don't. Period.-The graphics aren't the greatest. Which is fine, you shouldn't be buying a snooker game to look for high definition graphics. Even so, sometimes you just can't avoid noticing people like this:http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/477768284585810206/64BB18D8ECA4F9FFDEDF99EB8BF042EBF90CF5DF/-When I mentioned a ""healthy dose"" of varying skill levels in tournaments, I half lied. Half the opponents are Jekyll Hyde behind a cue stick. Makes an awesome bounce off the wall that would make pros cry in one break; inexplicably sinks the wrong ball for absolutely NO REASON WHATSOEVER the next break.-Mind-numbing physics - I cannot count the number of times I've aimed for the corner pocket and had my ball repeatedly bounce off the corner, going neither into the pocket nor back out onto the table. Once is amusing. Thrice is bemusing. 13th time is agonizing.-Adding onto the above, the ball will never, EVER fly off the table from being hit too hard. If I could climb up onto the table and hit the ball with a golf club, it would never leave the surface of the table. Not really important, but just a petty annoyance of mine.Closing statement: It's not a bad game. If it's under $10, it's worth the money. It's not polished, it's not pretty, but it's still entertaining. Just don't buy it for multiplayer."

There is no tutorial to hold your hand here, much to my regret. That having been said, the 'difficulty' of this game is considerably higher than that of Pool Nation [edit: corrected by markie].I won't bother going over the rules for Snooker (if you're seeing this, you have internet) but will comment that the interface in International Snooker allows for a great deal of precision. You also get options for 9-ball and 8-Ball. The practice mode is helpful for getting the initial gameplay down as well. My only gripe here, which is NOT the game's fault, is Snooker's pace-- the game moves a lot slower than 9-Ball.All in all, this is a fair game... but if you aren't playing it Specifically For Snooker then Pool Nation is the better buy for a number of reasons.

,Not Recommended,299500,12595221,"Posted: 21 October, 2014",all,Cocopino,"""Quite possibly the most realistic Snooker game to come to any gaming platform""Well... if I were a betting man I'd wager against that. It most certainly isn't the most fun snooker/pool/billiards game I've ever played.Snooker games, by default, are always a little bit slow and can be a little boring at times but there are many ways to speed things up considerably and/or create a little more immersion than just looking at a cue and a bunch of balls for the entirety of the game.Some of those things could be (none of these are implemented in this game but have been in other, earlier games in the same genre):Immersion- Showing the players during, but at least before they start the match. They get introduced, wave at the crowd, receive a bit of applause and so forth.- Showing the players after winning a frame or match: are they affected by that respotted black game?- Getting a maximum break in a tournament. In real life, you'll see players crying, getting congratulations from everybody including the opponent, receiving paychecks and what not. In this game, you'll get a message once the frame finishes: ""You made a maximum break. Brag about it on Facebook"". That's it.- The thrill of winning a tournament. Surely, a bit more than looking at a rotating cup is not too much to ask?But, since most of its predecessors did not have any immersion like that either, maybe this game will make up for it in the fluid gameplay? Because with fluid, exiting gameplay you'd still have a solid billiards game. Unfortunately, no:- When playing against the AI, your opponent will have some sort of ""I'm going to make a 26 break now"" mindset. So what he'll do is make 7 shots in a row, some of them near impossible because his shot selection can be awful at times. Then he'll miss a really simple shot, probably because he reached the quota he was looking for. Not something you'd expect from ""the most realistic Snooker game"" if you ask me.- The game should find the ball I most likely will try to pot next. Instead, it will default to some awkwardly placed ball on the cushion, forcing you to do way too much manually.- Which brings me to the next point: it's too hard to aim. The mouse is too sensitive, and there's no ""fine tune aim"" button.- Instead, to fine tune you'll need to adjust the camera. And adjusting the camera will need a click on the camera icon. Why are no shortcut keys implemented? Why not make use of the middle of right mouse button? That is just plain lazy. It's like they never even played their own game.So because of various reasons, taking a shot will take way too long. Resulting in a very tedious exercise, a single frame will take you a long time. Then take into account that to win a single tournament, you'll need to win a best of 3 games, then two best of 5 games, then a best of 7 game, and last but not least a best of 9 game. Now, after several hours of tedious play you get to claim your reward: the visual of a spinning cup. Rock! Just 11 more tournaments of exactly the same to go! However, I am almost certain most people will not even reach the point of winning a single tournament.There are some good things about the game, like the stuff you can buy with upgrade points (different chalk to get more spin on the ball, different cues to be able to hit harder etc) but to get to these rewards you'll need to grind endlessly.Since this is the only Snooker game on Steam, I'll probably end up playing it some more but I cannot recommend it to anyone.Instead, look for Pool Nation. It's just pool but literally everything has been done better in that game."

I had to forfeit a match after scratching on a shot where the cue ball would not return to the table, so the game could proceed.   In this game if you have not played it, you earn credits to upgrade your cue, get different couloured chalk, etc.   I spent my credits on the auto-chalk feature, where the computer is supposed to chalk your cue before each shot.   I started failing on a lot of shots, and attributed the problem to not manually chalking my cue, even though | had this feature.The ability to fine tune your shot would be enhanced if you could use a key stroke to fine tune the angle, rather than just adjusting the mouse.

By no means is this ""the most realistic Snooker Game to come to any platform"" - I have a Snooker game on my smart phone that's better than this, seriously. The main issue for me is that there are clearly control issues that mean that no matter how hard you try, you're not going to make those tricky shots and not even some of the easy ones. The AI on the other hand seems to have been provided with superior aiming ccntrols as it rarely makes an error once at the higher levels of tournaments.Effectively you cannot consistently rely on the aiming paths shown and neither they - or the cue ball indicted paths -  are long enough to complete long shots and accuratley predict cue ball trajectory. Physics are not great either and forget trying to get back spin on the cue ball when you most need it. Just watch that cue ball fly into the pockets.Overall it's an OK attempt but sadly lacking in the areas that would make gameplay enjoyable rather than frustrating.- there are certainly better Sooker games out there, and just a pity that they're not on Steam."

There are some out there that complain about missing shots they *believe* should go, but thats not the issue I have. Honestly it feels similar to other pool games I DO like, and if you have played snooker in person, you understand why those *unmissable* shots actually can be missed. Snooker is not pool, the tables are longer, the pockets are tighter entery with pointed bumpers, not rounded. The game does fine representing that aspect. What kills this game is the AI. I  tested  level 1 AI for this example: You can start a game with this AI and think, rightfully so if your not a rookie, that you will destroy it, and you will....or will you? because all of a sudden, frame 2, it goes from missing most shots, to clearing the table, and intensionally using *snooker* tactics against you. This should never be a level 1 trait. I hope another deveoper with a better sense of AI development can create a snooker game that feels like this."

It's not difficult to make high breaks due to the target lines, and you can still manipulate the white exactly as you would in real life.  If you can think a shot, you can play it.  But the AI is merciless, and can also knock up a 30-50 break if you leave the table open.  This is frustrating to watch the AI pot virtually everything it goes for...but it leaves you with a massive stress and tension to try and rack up some big scores each visit (and this IS possible like I said), this tension is what you expect the pro's to feel playing against each other, so I guess this is very accurate.The REAL frustrating thing I find is the lack of fouls the AI gives away.  Most games, you would run out of position and have to cut a ball in very thin with power, so the white would ricochet around and you are praying you wouldn't foul....Inevitably you would occasionally with a bit of bad luck.  But the AI doesn't suffer from this ""bad luck"".  In about 30 frames I gave away about 30 fouls, and the AI gave away 2!!!I would definately recommend this to snooker/pool players, that think about their shots rather than just line it up and hit it...if that's the way you play, the masterful AI will beat you."
