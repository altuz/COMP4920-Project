Maybe that is the main philosophic meaning of the game: unlike people, galaxy has no reason to hurry."

We are on the search to find the sun which has stopped shining and it made the earth worried.The game is a platforming game where you  try to reach the portal at the end of the level. You avoid spikes and other stuff to reach the portal. But this game has a twist if you jump of a level you will appear at the top of it and vice versa.The soundtrack is very relaxing and even if the levels get frustrating the music does somewhat calm you down.With graphics there's not much I can say, cause there's basically nothing to say about them.The game is fun and for the price it's worth the pick up, but there are a few bad things I want to address.The game is short, only 1 hour long, but there are reverse levels after you finish the first batch of the levels.Not to mention the story dialogue sometimes glitches and you have restart the game to fix the problem.Overall the game is fun and for the price I highly suggest trying it out.Final Rating:7/10 - Worth PlayingIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about this review.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

It is simple, but fascinating to first use.Then, every new planet you visit has a new mechanic implemented.

The fact that the top of the screen wraps around with the bottom is quite cool. The goal is to get to the Sun and ask him some questions. Then after you do that, to go back to your place by Earth.The Moon level set does a good job of making you understand the main mechanic of jumping through the screen.The Earth level set gives you another interesting mechanic: a box which launches you in the opposite direction from where you hit it (up or down). It also plays a note that goes along with the background music which is a really nice touch.The Venus level set has the best music in my opinion. It also introduces a sort of power-up which allows you to pause your upwards jump or downwards fall, stopping you in the air completely before gravity kicks in and pulls you downwards again. This allows you to avoid hitting spikes on the ceiling or to make longer jumps.Unfortunately another mechanic is introduced which is boring and rather frusterating. It's a timed wall that appears for two seconds and vanishes for two seconds. There's nothing really cool or fun about it, but it does add to the difficulty and challenge of the game.After the Venus levels, the game becomes a drag. It doesn't take too long to complete. While rushing, it took me about 1 hour 20 minutes. There are also achievements. These were fun to do. They add to the game if you want some extra, non-required challenge.Overall, it was a fun game for a while. AND IT'S ONLY $4. It's definitely worth buying the soundtrack with it. I like my Venus music."
,Recommended,299660,12189211,"Posted: 22 September, 2014",all,Skeith,"This is an absolutely mind benidng platformer with mixed elements that you have never seen before, all packed with a fairly good and quite calming soundtrack.Walking into this game you must toss aside most of your traditional platforming wisdom. The game takes a completely new take on platforming mechanics and executes a great 2-3 hour experience with it. In this game, falling off to the bottom or jumping through the top (or in the later half of the game, the opposite!) will instead loop you around to the other side, as though your jump went across a cylinder. On top of that, you can't control how long your jump is, making for even more careful (not torturous) platforming. It's completely wild and in the same kind of way that portal does, it just absolutely bends your mind for nearly the entirety of the game.The soundtrack of the game is zen-like in its nature and even if a level would otherwise be particularly hard and mildly rage inducing, I even found myself just saying ""Damn."" calmly after multiple failures at just the first part of one level. In fact, I have yet to be actually mad from this game just from it's soundtrack. Your experience may vary, but it is still a great feature.The only unfortunate thing about this game is that its story is completely lost in translation. You can certainly understand what's being said if you mix and replace some words, but the story is extremely minimal and unless you are someone who plays games almost exclusively for a story then this shouldn't be an issue and may even further lighten the mood because of some silly translations.Overall, I would recommend the game, espeically for its price point. It knows exactly what it's worth, so if you're interested, give it a whirl."

For a 4 dollar title, you get a nice relaxing experience that not only has some good level design that will challenge you with the mechanics it puts place, but one that will put you in a zen state of mind, even if you get frustrated. While the biggest problem it has is the games length (which lets be clear, seems appropriate for the 4 dollar price tag), the strong presentation carries the game by making it something you just want to look at, despite the limited color scheme. Mechanics don't stick around for too long before moving on to the next one, and sometimes you do have to think a little outside the box in order to move on in a stage. All in all, if you're looking for something to test your mind but not stress it, 6180 The moon is a solid pick up.Video Review:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfHm0jJ2W2QLists:Positives:Solid puzzle elements that introduce new mechanics in a timely fashion. Just as you master the last element, you are introduced to a new one, or a shift in thinking to use it in a new way.Great presentation, using the limited color scheme to make it feel.Timing is tested here, and its in a good difficulty setting.Pleasant piano music really puts you in a relaxed mode.The reversal of stages on the way back shows some really good level design understanding and giving a challenges.Sound design is good, giving you the little hints you need to react appropriate.Animation is fluid. Yes, it's not that difficult to get animation working, but hey, it stills is good.The story is touching, even in its simple, cute form.Negatives:Little hiccups with controls here and there on respawn.Story may make you groan at times. It can be too cute.A little short. Would like to see more given the big picture, although to be fair, at 4 bucks, that's asking a lot."

The concept is great, the music is great, (so far it sounds similar to Thomas Was Alone.

The difficulty increases slowly throughout the game, though never gets too difficult at all.  The story and the way it is told reminds me of Thomas Was Alone, which is also another great game.The only negatives I can think of are that it's a bit short, though the price makes it worthwhile.

Recommended for a very low price, if you've got nothing better to be doing.The music and overall aesthetic are simple but good, and create a calm ambiance that mostly does not get in the way of the game, and does appear to enhance it.However, the writting falls flat, with spelling mistakes, particularly poor characterisation for all characters, and a mystery plot for which the final reveal is unsatisfying due to being logically inconsistent. It attempts to tell many different aesops, which for the most part are poorly constructed and are universally poorly delivered, and ends up feeling like it doesn't know what message it wants to give. The cutscenes are unskippable and get in the way of the game.The level design is hit-and-miss, with necessary mechanic explanation levels, exploratory levels, and interesting challenges mixed in with levels which made me question how well the designer really understood their gameplay mechanics. Some almost unavoidable bugs, especially regarding the screen-wrapping mechanic, mostly do not get in the way of enjoying the game.It is an exceptionatly short game, with my completion time (no extras or replays) sitting at 0.7 hours, and the ""Moon Rising"" mode adding an extra 0.3 hours. It also has very little replay value due to being a puzzle game.I would not recommend this game for anything over $5. Fortunately, it is currently on sale for under $4, and I consider it to be worth spending that money for a quick bit of enjoyment."

The game is divided into short levels, where the goal is to reach the end while avoiding any hazards. Intermixed with these levels are scenes where the moon speaks with other members of the solar system it encounters along the way.The main gameplay mechanic is that the top and bottom of the screen are linked: falling off the bottom makes you reappear at the ceiling, and jumping high into the ceiling makes you pop up from the bottom. A few other gameplay elements also show up, and while later levels get a bit more involved, they are never overly difficult, especially due to the abundance of save points. This, combined with the ambient soundtrack, makes for a very nice casual experience.Although the game is quite short  - I was able to complete everything within 2 hours - it's definitely worth checking out whenever it goes on sale."

It was kinda cute, but basically something you'd find in a children's book. Nothing fantastic.Second, the gameplay. Innovative concept, good platforming, and all in all a lot of fun.So when those two things meet, you have a fun game with a meh story, and you get something that's just ok.

After the Sun disappears, the people of Earth beg the Moon to search for the Sun before all of Earth's trees are cut down for heat and everyone freeze's to death.Full review: 6180 the moon is a neat platformer which uses a technique, which should really be used more in gaming, called ""screen wrapping,"" or a ""wraparound"". This technique connects the top and bottom of the screen in each level so that otherwise bottomless pits will simply seamlessly drop you from the top of the screen whilst you keep your momentum.Introduced in each new (literally) world are new mechanics which make solving each level somewhat difficult, including spikes, one-time-use ""spring blocks"", temporary walls and floors, buttons which connect to otherwise unbreakable walls and floors, and momentum-stopping balls of light.The story is rather simple, not thought provoking, and isn't really needed in this type of game, but the addition of a story is a nice touch none-the-less. The ""characters"" introduced are also somewhat memorable and can give you a bit of a chuckle.I only have two small problems with this game: 1) touching the non-sharp, smooth, non-deadly sides of the spikes kill you (this is a problem in most video-games which should really be looked in to. Spelunky is the only game I know of where touching the sides of spikes doesn't kill you). 2) the hitbox of said spikes are a bit bigger than you'd expect (when the Moon ""dies"", you can see its ""body"" fading into darkness, and when you see this animation you can see that there's a good 1cm gap between the spike and the Moon's ""body"").Do I recommend buying 6180 the moon? Yes; it's a simple, not-too-easy/not-too-hard puzzle game that can entertain you for a couple of hours, the soundtrack's nice and doesn't distract you from the gameplay, and if you're a speedrunner this might be a good game to race others with. For NZD$4.99, I'd say wait for when this game is a dollar or two off before buying it."

Barely works as a proof of concept for the gimmicks and hardly qualifies as entertainment. Great job on the music and the minimalistic style and planet's theme was elegant, however certain platforms and enemies did not fit the thematic such as musical note blocks, the disappearing carpet of blocks...Review: 6180 the moon plays a lot like a minimalistic style platformer in the tradition of Super Meat Boy. You do not have lives, and you are afforded checkpoints as you progress. Each level is short, and plays out like a puzzle. The gimmick is that you can fall through the floor to reappear on the ceiling of the level and vice versa. The novelty fades off quickly but then again the game is very short and is almost like a proof of concept than a real game. Once you beat the storyline, you can attempt to beat the game all over again starting from the finish line and trying to get back to the starting point, with your sphere falling upwards, jumping down, and keeping the ceiling/floor mechanic. It becomes rather disorienting and I assume it would be possible to retrain your brain to be effective at solving this, but doing so would not be very enjoyable and it is not a skill you are likely to be able to carry over in any other game either. I rather enjoyed the spacey new age-ish music and the theme of the planets but some elements felt amiss and the dialogue was very poor which detracted a lot from the artistic appeal of the game.I would recommend this insteadhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/242820/"

It isn't really derivative of SMB and feels like its own game, but the controls aren't as tight.  There's a little touch of looseness which has you missing platforms and touching spikes.  While I slogged through the addictive levels of SMB until I 100%ed the game, I found myself playing 6180 in short sessions, and I've completed it in 5 hours.  Like SMB, death is quick and restarts are quick.  There are little continue points sprinkled through levels to make it less frustrating.  The jumps have a wrap mechanic from the top to bottom, but you quickly get used to it.  Each set of levels adds a new mechanic, but boy oh boy was I sick of spikes at the end of it all.  The music is beautiful, but the levels get a little repetitive and it;s not nearly as addicting as SMB.  Actually, if SMB is an A+ game, this is sort of a C+.

It's basically just the simplest ever platformer with minimal graphics, and the only real gimmick is that the screen wraps vertically.  That's just not enough to save it, IMO.  VVVVVV uses the same mechanic for a few screens, and it's kind of novel.  When you make an entire game out of it, it falls flat.The music is not bad, but very generic.  I'm not sure if it was repeating a short tune for the whole game, or if it just sounded similar enough all the way through that I didn't notice.The minimal graphics can't really be too bad, since they're just basic monochrome shapes  (though I did notice a lot of screen tearing)Anything resembling a puzzle or platforming challenge was an illusion.  Yeah you might occasionally time something wrong and hit the spikes, but it was always immediately obvious what to do, and generally not at all challenging to pull it off.I did all the achievements in the game in 114min, and that included a lot of time that I left the game sitting while I was AFK.

,Not Recommended,299660,15189558,"Posted: 3 April, 2015",all,RANVEERA CHINGAAH,"A coffeebreak puzzle platformer with a screen-looping mechanic.An intriguing premise, but this game feels more like a buggy beta than a proper game ready for release. If the problems had been worked out, it could have been interesting. As it stands, it is a couple short hours of at best a mind-bending and fairly forgiving physics gimmick game, and at worst intense frustration, glitches and shamefully awful writing.TL;DR:Music is excellent, but writing is abysmal, glitches abound, and when you reach the half-way point, the game reverses your physics and expects you to redo the levels backwards, while pressing theuparrow to jumpdown.Good:Music- This game comes with a buyable soundtrack and there's no mystery why. The music is atmospheric, floaty and zen, which blends in well with the simple aesthetic the designers were clearly going for.Menus and UI- This might not normally be worth mentioning, but the menus introduce the game and its theme well. They fit the aesthetic and are intuitive and easy to navigate.Floating- This game makes use of a fixed jump height with a floaty arc as the base of its jumping physics, and admittedly it feels great and free just clearing a bank of spikes with a long, lazy, beautiful arc.Bad:Writing- So bad that it is noticeably the worst thing about this game. Each of the planets is depicted as a dry, one-dimensional stereotype that seems like it's trying to give a Sunday special moral lesson that in many cases isn't even true. The game would be improved greatly by removing the dialogue moments entirely.Glitches- Above dialogue moments often show text popping in at one size and then immediately popping down to another font size. Sometimes two text entries appear on top of one another, rendering both unreadable. There's a negative space that you move through in between the moment you disappear off the bottom of the screen and the moment you emerge from the top of it, and while in that space you phase through moving platforms; it seems like they go through more negative space than you do. There are also a couple of glitches that can make you hit the wrong side of a bounce block, or freeze in place.Phase Walls- One of the introduced mechanics are walls that appear, fade, and disappear. This is a platforming staple, but in this game, I found it hard to get a feel for how long they would spend in each phase. More distinct or more fluid visual cues might have helped here.Symmetry- Given how much time you spend bouncing from the top to the bottom of the screen and back again at times, it can feel awkward how different falling down feels compared to rising up.However, the symmetry of controls becomes more important once you have reached the sun and are tasked with going back through all the levels in reverse - in this mode, you ""jump"" down (by pressing the up key, no less), ""fall"" up and stick to the bottoms of platforms, which is extremely unintuitive. Having come back to this game and completed the reverse levels, I can attest that many of the earliest levels are in fact designed to be much more challenging backwards, but nevertheless, the difficulty curve on the return is highly erratic rather than smooth."

No time trials, or user generated content to keep you interested.-Occasional lack of response to my keystrokes, or response to keystrokes that never were.-Twice I got stuck in thin air and once more somewhere I could not see me.-For some reason the ""W"" key decided to stop working halfway through, forcing me to switch to arrows, 3 levels after thinking it was a deliberate game mechanic.-Infuriating platforming and extremely lacking on the ""puzzle"" part. Some extremely unforgiving levels, which felt unfair. I almost ragequit 3-4 times and would have if this game wasn't so short.-Stupid timed puzzles, completely out of sync with the music, making timed jumps a massive pain.

The main mechanic the game runs around makes it very confusing to wrap your head around at first, but once you get into the mindset of it, it becomes a lot of fun. I wouldn't even call this a true platformer, because the way you play this is so vastly different than a regular platformer.The mechanics require you to think non-linearly, up can become down, and down becomes up, the way to complete a level more often than not is not the most obvious way, which I love. The sound design is amazing and fits perfectly for the game, anything else would just make it frustrating. The game is fairly short, i've only played about 1 hour of it and i'm almost to the sun stages (that's what I assume, might be wrong), but you can spend a lot of time replaying levels because there are a few ways of doing a certain run differently. It's definitely worth the $3.99. Buy it for yourself, your parents, your friends,  hell even gift it to your goldfish, it's that much fun."

Good.This little puzzle/platformer game, in which you play as a visually minimalistic and anthropomorphized version of the moon in a mostly high-contrast environment, bears the number ""6180"" because that is apparently the number of minutes it took this game's two programmers to create this game from start to finish. ""109"" however is the number of minutes it took me to decide I had played this good little game to my satisfaction and while the gameplay itself is fun, it is the generally wonderful music that really makes this game truly worthwhile (despite the fact that in some parts the music does sound like bad shopping or elevator music). Truly, the good parts of this game's music are so wonderful that the quality of the game itself is often completely overshadowed by the amazing music. Despite a few shortcomings here and there, this little game definitely has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard any game have (if you like quasi-ambient peaceful music with high pitched tones).+Interesting gameplay with a nice mechanic where you are able to jump or fall through the bottom of the screen and then out of the top of the screen.+Lots of interesting platform game style puzzles.+Fun little anthropomorphic story featuring anthropomorphic planets which talk to each other using text.+Wonderful, beautiful music (except in certain places where the music sounds like elevator music).+Keyboard controls allow for a great deal of precision.+So far as I remember, this game was very inexpensive.+No bugs.+/-Highly minimalistic graphics, interface and controls.-Can become repetitive or frustrating easily (though this is minimized by the game's tremendously fast loading times) to the extent that this game is best played for short periods of time only once in a while (unless you like this kind of puzzle platformer game more than I do)."

Through the combo of “gravity” and ye olde wraparound screen boundries you’ll be dodging spikes, spinning blades, and general death by landing/bouncing on the “ok” surfaces. I can get pretty bored with a platformer, but this worked for me.  Not long enough to overstay its welcome, and a ramping difficulty that kept it interesting.Aesthetically though is where I think this game really scored with me. The soundtrack is fantastic and I even enjoyed the over-simplified graphics. If I had one complaint it would be that the respawn time was about twice as long as it should have been to make this incredibly fun - in a game where you die hundreds of times the death/respawn animation shouldn’t make it more frustrating.Oh, also the story is kinda lame.  For a couple of bucks and a couple of hours though, I still recommend.Who should play:  People with a couple of hours to kill and like platformers with atmospheric musicWho should not play:  Anyone looking for a deep experience"

Despite the lack of pits as a result, 6180 still manages to present a challenge both by using spikes as obstacles, and by adding new concepts to the newer stages.  There is a very atmospheric soundtrack to the game, not only fitting for the space theme but also quite calming, rather welcome when some of the stages can present frustration and repeated deaths.It is quite a short game, perhaps an hour or less to play through fully.  It certainly doesn't overstay a welcome, and if anything feels like it could've been longer.  However, it seems the developers wanted things to end once they had presented the ideas they had with the mechanics, and so the game ends with all the stages well designed but without it being drawn out and without stages repeating themselves.6180 the moon is a game which I would recommend.  If you are interested in an unusual platformer, or want a quick game which does a great job of presenting its mechanics and challenges directly, then I would highly recommend checking it out.  If you are looking for a game with hundreds of different stages and variants, or where you can sink dozens of hours into, then 6180 the moon is not likely a game you would be interested in."
