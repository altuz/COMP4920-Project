It feel's like you're playing a painting.Just a couple of downsides:1. no save function? and if you quit, it should really say something like ""are you sure? you will lose all your progress""2. sometimes the really cool musical themes build up wonderfully and then just abrupty shift to ambient sounds. It's a little jarring. I think a fading transition would suit the mood of the game more.3. I respect the slow pace of the game, it's very calming, but it feels a little dull at times because just moving around the (very beautiful) scenery is not very interactive feeling. Just  clicking and saying ""go there"" feels a bit out of place in such a tactile game.Over all really cool game but I'm probably not going to finish it because it was a little slow, which was nice, but I lost all my progress (see problem #1) and I just dont feel like it will be as cool the second time around, I think I'll just be bored. 10$ is a bit steep for this I think, since it had a couple of significant areas of improvement, but if's you're rolling in cash and want a lovely, relaxing, focused, sensory experience... I'd say go for it."

I'd been keeping my eye on this game for years after falling in love with the art style and the concept of a 2.5D side-scroller set among the pages of an origami pop-up book. But now that I've finally gotten around to playing it, sadly I've found there's little here to really love beyond the shallow surface.Inspired by Japanese culture, Tengami sees you control a little paper cut-out man as you flip and fold the paper scenery to move forward. It's a really great idea, and you could almost even call it ""cute"" with how aesthetically endearing it is to grab on a point at the side of a river then pull it open to reveal a bridge for you to cross, or pry apart some paper rocks to open up a cave entrance. But when it comes to the actual moment to moment gameplay, that's where it sorely falls flat.The problem is, it feels like there's very little to really do. You'll spend most of your time walking slowly across the pages, only occasionally coming upon points of interest that you can actually interact with in any significant way. This will typically involve moving some paper around into the right place to either unlock the path ahead or gain a new item used to unlock the path ahead, and I hate to say it, but I just didn't find many of the puzzles to be all that interesting. Some are clever, some are tedious, all are incredibly pretty, but almost none of them were particularly satisfying. I didn't feel any great sense of joy or accomplishment upon completing them, but rather relief at getting them out of the way so I could finally move on - which is frequently hindered by the amount of backtracking you sometimes have to do as you slowly point and click your way over old scenery.I've no problem with slow-paced games, and backtracking doesn't have to be a burden provided it's in small doses and with something interesting to pass the time on the way there, but when those two things are combined, it doesn't make for a fun time.The aural side of things was a little disappointing, too. Maybe it's just my horribly uncultured Western knowledge rearing its ugly head; only being familiar with the hard clichés and stereotypes of other cultures rather than their subtlety and nuances, but I just wasn't getting a very strong Japanese tone to either the music or audio in general. I simply wasn't feeling as steeped and immersed in the sound anywhere near as much as I was the visuals.I don't want to be down on the game too much; it was made by a very small team, and if I recall correctly, had a pretty drawn out development, but the love for the product does come through, even if it doesn't entirely pay off.As loathe as I am so say this, I think this is a game that's far better enjoyed when viewed rather than played, as its beauty lies almost solely in its visuals and little else. I'd kill for a Neutral recommendation button right now, but I'm going to rate it positively, partially as it's a valiant and sincere effort far more worthy of praise for its attempted creativity rather than its failed ambitions, but also as a gesture of good faith of sorts, as I really hope the studio will carry on and produce even greater works in the future."

Admittedly they are all no brainers, then again I knew on my account that I was buying the game for the art and interest rather than all-out action or overly complicated solvers.If you're a fan of the Japanese architecture and landscapes with some decent interaction that compromises of exploring and collecting, then this is all for you. Think of it as Dear Esther, where here the narration is gone but the interaction is there.Unfortunatly it is very short as I finished it just under two houres. Then again, I prefer these interesting, short experiences where my brain can easily wander through than just staring at the screen for houres and houres with a buildup of frustration.

The puzzles are very easy and the only reason i racked up 2 hours gameplay is because i left the pc to make drinks etc. i would say you have around 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours to completion maybe 2 1/2 if your really not good at puzzles.Most of the puzzles are very simple , slide something up , slide it down etc. at the end there are a few puzzles where its more about observation and remembering symbols you see.I Wanted to love this so much but by the end of the game  iwas relieved to finish it as if there had been another level i honestly would have just quit as i couldnt stand the same formula of puzzle again.Maybe for £1.99 it wouldnt have been so bad but still for me personally after waiting so long for this game i feel let down by it. If you are into extremely relaxed gameplay and simple puzzles in a serene enviroment this is probably one for you to try, for me it was to slow , to small , to easy."

The music perfectly matches with the game design, and creates a good atmosphere for the game.

Seriously, the character moves sloooowly. I know it's supposed to be part of the general relaxing experience but it ended up annoying me and not relaxing meBecause the game is very short - finished it in one sitting of 90 minutes, getting all the achievements - and has no replay valueBecause for those reasons, $10 for this game is way too much expensive.

Tengami follows what I assume to be Buddha's path to enlightenment, or at least an interpretation thereof. Well, maybe not Buddha....maybe the path is your own. The story is conveyed through a pretty unique pop up book origami style of artwork and puzzlecraft along with some musical, calligraphy, and a few other styles of puzzles. The puzzles themselves are pretty clever. So, much like the path to enlightenment, the story sequence also follow the change in seasons, which is also pretty brilliant. The soundtrack is perfect. Soothing and yet invigorating with a sense of mystery. I mentioned the artwork, but I didnt mention that it is all watercolor soft tones, and is just simply beautiful.This was really an all around great game.My only complaint, which is just a personal preference, would be to let our protagonist run. I get that the slow pace is part of the contemplative experience, and I don't knock it for this, but at times, I just wished I could forego that in favor of running, especially when going back and forth several times to solve a puzzle. However, this is truly a minor complaint, and as I mentioned, it's truly designed to enhance the contemplative experience.Very zen, very Buddhist, and quite brilliant.I absolutely give this game 10 out of 10 and recommend supporting these developers by buying the game for the asking price if you have the means to do so. Well worth it. The game is short but does not feel like it at all, and you will finish the game with a definite sense of satisfaction."

Calm colors, nothing glaring but sometimes too bland. Good use of the cut-outs to make 3D and depths.

There's some nice atmosphere in terms of the varied palette and the art, music and sound effects in general.But I feel the game failed to live up to its potential. There's no real ""wow"" moments, like I got from games done in a similar spirit, such as Kentucky Route Zero or Monument Valley. Here are two major failings:Puzzles. The puzzles aren't very engaging. I only enjoyed one where you flip through 3 columns of terrain to mix and match platforms, thereby forging a path to progress. The other puzzles are tedious at best. One puzzle requires you to count hidden symbols around the environment to crack a code. This is all done passively without any hint that it's even what you need to do. I used a walkthrough; no regrets.Story. The game has only a basic shell of a story which isn't even marginally compelling. It is in fact based on a single haiku; a fairly cliché one at that. It's the kind of one-dimensional first introduction you get of Japanese culture in a western primary school. As a western developed game, I feel they took a traditional Japanese aesthethic but failed to grasp the spirit of Japanese culture or storytelling.In short, I didn't feel Tengami had any real passion put into its development. Since it's lacking both compelling gameplay and story, I'm left wondering who I'd recommend it to. I think it would only be suitable for a parent and child to play together, or as a source of inspiration for game developers."

I would say, there is no storyline in meaning we're all used to. There is no answer, how did our character happen to be on such a journey, neither you'll be able to guess what will happen after the title screen.

Tengami is a unique experience, it's like a playable work of art. I've never before seen a game utilize the mechanics of a pop-up book before, which made it that much more exciting. Every chapter unfolds slowly and gracefully, showcasing beautiful landscapes and thought-provoking puzzles to solve. You pull, push, and slide tabs, revealing hidden secrets and routes in order to guide your character on his path.The colors are rich and vibrant, and the style evokes the gorgeous art of the Edo Period. I love the feel of it, like wandering through a painting or a dream. The puzzles are challenging but intuitive enough for you to figure them out without much frustration. The serene music adds to overall experience. I also very much enjoyed the use of haiku, which was really the only narrative in the game at all. It's minimalistic as far as plot goes but it's a powerful one, about the cycle of life and death. Your character does not speak, nor is there any intrusive messages telling you where to go or what to do. It's incredibly relaxing.  If you wish, though, you can choose to view hints for the various puzzles in the pause menu.My only complaint, isn't much of one at all. I noticed there was no way to make your character move any faster, and yes, travelling from one place to the next and back again can be a very slow and lengthy enterprise.  But then I came to realize this was also part of the game. They don't want you to run or rush through things, it would only ruin the experience. You must play the game with an open and thoughtful mind to truly appreciate it."

From the very start you are disconnected from the character simply because the game fails to explain whats hapening. Somthing dark has happened. Death  of a loved one maybe. So how do you deal with it. Go and gather some pettles. To nourish a tree so you could grab a pettle from it in the end and reach an all too common conclusion about life and death. Sorry Tengami but your attempts at being poetic and symbolic utterly fail as well.Too often i was slowed down to a litteral crawl sliding things around trying to find the right order or searching for symbols hidden around so i could open a lock or a door or somthing.In the end i felt Tengami wasted my time with nonsensical puzzle design and uninteresting story with a character i could not connect with. You dont realy know what you are really doing and why until you reach the very end and what hope you had held that there was going to be somthing deeper and more meaningful will just fall then as well.Dont bother unless its just for the visuals. Nothing here worth 5 €. Reading this review is probably more interesting than playing this game is going to be.

Scenes are artistic and reminiscient of an artfully crafted pop-up book, right down to the two-dimensional 'protagonist'. There is no real plot or story line to speak of, the primary focus on this game was the artistic design, and the secondary focus was the puzzles.Puzzles pose mild to no challenge; all are solvable with time and patience (most of this being the result of the puzzles that require you to do a bit of back and forth traveling). I only had one puzzle that I got stuck on, simply because I wasn't walking close enough to an object to get the ""interact"" indicator.Recommended for casual puzzle gamers, particularly for the breathtaking artwork and accompanying soundtrack."

The art style and scenery is beautiful, the music enchanting and the puzzles, while not always too intuitive, are entertaining, well constructed and rarely tedious. I think the excellent score the game currently has well reflects the inherent quality of the game. There are many other reviews that gush about how wonderful this game is and I don’t feel the need to add anymore to that as it would be a disservice to those looking to the reviews to buy the game. Play it for yourself, you won’t be disappointed.The thing I did want to address were the criticisms about the length of the game. I felt that the game was just the right length without feeling like ideas were repeated and the inherent arc of the story felt very correct.  I have seen that a decent amount of people have criticized the length of the game, especially in consideration of the price. I feel that is an unfair criticism as this game has a lot of good content and every moment is magical, there is rarely a boring moment found in this game. Some people will say that they can get a game like FIFA and get hundreds of hours from it so why pay for a game like this and get just 2 hours? Simple, because it’s a deep, artistic and emotional experience that will stay with you.I will always support beautiful games with great story, there is a very different feeling of immersion compared to film and this game backs that statement.Even at full price, this game is well worth it!"

The music is also nice, but it cuts in and out, and the pieces are short. It seems like the soundtrack uses a few demo songs from something else, and lets silence fill in the gaps.However, once you get into it, it's quite short and it gets repetitive by the end. It need more variety in the puzzles and general gameplay. Right now it's your basic ""Rinse, Wash, Repeat"" cycle.For the gameplay length, it's really short. For $10, it's far far too short.That 1.4 hours I've played (to completion) is mostly correct. About 15 extra minutes are added because I got distracted by the Venture Brothers special. (All This and Gargantua 2!)Basically, if you can get it on sale for $2-$4, go for it. It's a good way to kill an hour."

I suppose something can be done with that.But the pacing is very slow, and there really isn't enough going on, visually, to make up for it. It's simple gradients and textures, and simple shapes, and you have a long time for things to sink in, because the dude walks pretty slowly. There is usually a full screen of space between elements you can interact with, and while I can appreciate this from an encapsulation perspective, the space between things plus the slow walking plus the simple art means that just moving around gets boring. Like, Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery also had you moving a person around at a pretty fixed walking speed, but the Scythian walks more quickly, and the environment is lush and alive. The soundtrack and the ambience are carefully developed, the bushes wiggle as little pixel squirrels run around: it's great, and Tengami has none of that. Halfassed sprite fire, halfassed sprite waterfalls, and halfassed polygon waves account for probably 90% of the animation you'll see that isn't your damn slow-walking dude.The puzzles barely count as puzzles:count the number of times symbols appearmake things visually matchchoose the symbols you see in the order they appearThe hardest thing the puzzles make you do is occasionally backtrack, which is only hard because it's boring.One extra sad moment: one puzzle involves counting a symbol that you can only see during the page transition, but it's in the game way after the page transition thing has lost its novelty, so instead of being the only point where the puzzles and concept interact meaningfully, it winds up being closer in effect to those parts in VGA point and click games where one of the things you had to click was really small and nondescript.As for the music... it's like the mp3 collection of a Reiki practitioner. Very little of the music actually has a japanese song structure, or even melodic structure: it's western music in a vaguely Japanese scale on a synth Koto over soft breakbeats. Less ""meditating samurai,"" more ""ad for a zen retreat for retired white people.""The puzzles are there to slow down a story, in three acts, that involves a melancholy samurai wandering around abandoned places doing incoherent things in search of cherry blossoms. Your reward for each act is a 3-5-3 haiku in english, and getting to put a blossom onto a barren cherry tree, which triggers a transition (a fade through black) to that portion of the tree being in bloom. The finale is another haiku, which seems to want to suggest that this was maybe like a meditation on memory and aging and death and stuff. Or like, whatever. It has seasons, and cherry blossoms. That's pretty deep♥♥♥♥♥♥Seriously, the written part of the story is maybe 55 syllables, if there was a haiku at the beginning. I don't remember, and it doesn't matter, because the point remains: there is effectively no story. You collect three cherry blossoms that, although they only blow away, are locked behind some pointlessly complicated yet easily defeatable barriers, and then apparently your life is over and you die or something. There are absolutely no other characters in the game, and no explanation for why this dude is alone for all of the incoherent stuff he does.You saw the trailer video, and it showed a page turn. You already have everything this game has to offer."

It's functional, but not much else.So, the game. There is no story to speak of, which wouldn't be a problem if the game was actually fun to play, but it isn't. The puzzles are a complete joke, I figured all of them out immediately with little thought. I did look at a walk through for one right at the end, not because it was hard but because I got tired of back tracking and was getting really bored. Which brings me to my next point: movement speed. Oh my god, the character walks slowly and as you spend the entire game walking to various points with brief breaks for puzzles (some of which involve back tracking to solve) this gets incredibly annoying. The game is already pretty short (my play time was 85min, but that included a break for a phone call so it was really closer to an hour) and most of it was spent clicking on a spot on the screen then looking at my phone while my character laboriously made their way there. If you are asking me to pay $10 for an hour long game don't have most of it be filler.The only thing to really recommend this game is the art style, but I was disappointed there too. The backgrounds are very monotonous and never really make use of the origami gimmick . I can think of a dozen games that actually have really enjoyable gameplay and/or stories and look way better (Okami, Child of Light, Ori and the Blind Forest, Hyper Light Drifter, Bastion, Dust: An Elysian Tail, Gravity Ghost, Titan Souls, They Bleed Pixels, Limbo, Fez, Road Not Taken).Overall, this game lacks depth in just about every way.

None of the puzzles should prove to be much of a hurdle in anyway.The game is pretty short took me just under 2hrs to finish the game but I enjoyed what there was. There are no saves though which may trouble some people. Before you start make sure you have enough time to finish it.

Some were right on the edge of max darkness for my monitor. Actually, some probably exceeded it because after more than a year of trying to find it, I checked a guide that just gave me the answer. I didn't want to - but there was no other way forward. Then I tried to take the next step in the story and without giving too much away, navigation was almost impossible to the next zone until I managed to outwit it by clicking around and making myself spin in place several times until I was allowed to move in the direction I needed to.I know there's not much left, but I have so little patience for this game left I don't know if I can push on any further."

The game is incredibly relaxing and scenic, the puzzles require some thought but are not frustrating, the pop-up book style is well done and very unique. I actually enjoyed the characters slow pace and I didn't mind that there wasn't a real plot, this is exactly the kind of game I have been looking to play as a way to relax at the end of stressful day.All those compliments said, I finished the game in less than 2 hours. I aknowledge that a lot of work and artistry went into creating each page of this game, but 2 hours of game play does not justify the price point in my opinion.

,Not Recommended,299680,14046789,"Posted: 18 January, 2015",all,Thomas 'Vimes' Bousquet,"Tengami is based on a smart and elegant premise: browsing a japanese pop-up book to go through a game.Tengami  even develops this concept in a tasteful, thoughtful direction: a contemplative series of puzzles linked by a sibylline narrative.However, Tengami falls short of being a memorable experience because none of its components ever reach their apex potential and neither do they mesh into a coherent, meaningful experience.On the visual side, there are some stunning set pieces (mostly in the third segment), but the character representation and the overall rendering miss that extra-polish, that extra expert craftmanship that would make them feel organic and mastered. As is, it feels very 'computery' and artificial, with no warmth or tactile feel to it. The UI, destination indicator and main menu are completely sub-par; as if afterthoughts.In a similar way, though the puzzles manage to establish a coherent and inspiring grammar in a fairly efficient and transparent manner; they remain mostly pedestrian and except for one sign-chasing puzzle at the end, I never wondered over or was drawn in by their use of the pop-up book aspect.Finally, the storytelling is either too obscure for me to comprehend or too divorced from the gameplay for me to grasp its relevance: the puzzle remain very abstract and are seldom informed. The poetry at the end of each segment shows an intent of conveying a certain flavor of contemplation, but without it showing in the rest of the game, it feels like a cope out.Overall, Tengami feels more like a thorough proof of concept than the fully explored experience its starting points should have led to; and  it's a testament to the quality of the indie scene - most notably in the puzzle genre - that this doesn't feel  good enough.This is where I wish Steam had more than 'Recommend' and 'Do not Recommend': Tengami is unique enough that it warrants to be played, but it is pales in comparison of other narrative, puzzle based or contemplative experiences.Still, I'm looking forward to what Nyamyam will do in the future: I hope they'll have the means and focus to explore their concepts more boldly, with greater attention to details and with an increased emphasis on the experience as a whole."

It is clearly ported from mobile as movement is restricted to mouse only (no keyboard support) and the drag mechanic to change the setting is typical of touchscreen devices. This is not inherently a bad thing as long as you're not looking for settings of any kind. While I cannot find it in my heart to downvote this game, it is hard to recommend at full price when you consider it takes about 1 hour to beat (the puzzles are not particularly difficult). I'm sure if I had this game on my phone or my tablet I could find myself replaying it a bit, but surely not for 10 hours. It's such a neat format too as it easily lends itself to updating with more content over time. For its standard price of $10 I would've certainly expected it to have additional content, like the soundtrack or an artbook, but no such luck. Nonetheless, you can buy the soundtrack by David Wise over at bandcamp(nyamyam.bandcamp.com).In short, Tengami is a nice little gem worth playing at a discount."
