,Recommended,299720,11398988,"Posted: 24 July, 2014",all,Zekail,"A new twist on the classic tower defence genre. Both challenging and entertaining, Ive been enjoying what ive gotten to play so far. Towers, upgrades, and maps unlock as you gain xp, and are persistant between maps. Upgrades are pretty standard with the level 1,2,3 system, however the level 3 upgrades seem to completely change the function of the tower, making for some new and interesting strategies. Cant wait to try out multiplayer! I strongly suggest this for any TD fan out there."
76561197960314247,Recommended,299720,18173612,"Posted: 24 September, 2015",all,Diablo_68,"Terrerohedron is a tower defence game with a lot of promise and is very addictive!The concept is of a standard tower defence game but the map is in three dimensions, at first this can confuse and be disorienting but after a few games you will be spinning the map round and planning your kill zones with relative ease.I normally like TD games that allow you to maze and shape the route that the enemy takes TH does not let you do this but gets very tactical as you can build in three dimensions, you place extendable blocks and then place towers on them or more extendable blocks. This makes looking at the map in all dimensions and then thinking of how you will build a 3d kill zone in an area quite rewarding.There is not a huge amount of variety in the towers but the game does give 3-4 solid different play sets with towers you can choose from, it feels good when you enclose a complete section and then have towers that the bullets bounce back and forth to deal a crazy amount of damage.There are also some great additions that should be in all TD games, a damage counter for each tower for each round and a total so that you can see tactics that work better or towers lagging behind. A huge choice in different target priorities for every single tower, this is something that should be standard in all TD games!The game has multiplayer also and at a recent lAN 3 of us spent far longer than we would have thought trying to improve our game and win together. It is a nice addition to the game and adds a lot more hours of fun to it.The game is definitely a small indie game that is what I hope the first edition, I got it on 95% sale and paid 19 pence for the game and so my following niggles not so much pan the game but are improvements I would love to see on the TH2 and I will pay more than 19 Pence for it!The units that you try to destroy are multisided shapes and you take off sides until they have no sides left and they are destroyed. This makes it quite hard later on to identify how bad the threat is as one moving unit could end up costing you the game as it has more than 100 sides and thus all your lives. I would assume this was done for ease but even some that glow would be helpful.The camera can get very disorientating and annoying to use, there are hotkeys to mark camera points and I recommend you use them. When you build an enclosed box it is hard to select towers to build.In multiplayer even the fastest game setting is quite slow and makes it quite slow to play.There are quite a few challenging difficulties and an impossible mode, this is not for the feint hearted and one map took me nearly 3 hours before I eventually lost, unfortunately most of the time in this was trying to spend the huge amount of money I got each round and it would take 10-15 minutes to spend it all. This is a small gripe as this mode is not to played that often but a quicker way to build would be nice. Also anyone who likes Minecraft would love this mode as it turns into a TD version of it.All in all, this game is very interesting if feeling like it has a lot more to be unlocked at some point. I highly recommend getting it even if you just play some of the easier settings on a few maps, it makes you think and mixes up the tower defence area.Oh and I loved the soundtrack, one of the few games I play with music on. Make Terrerhedron 2!!!"
,Recommended,299720,14393521,"Posted: 8 February, 2015",all,.40z,"what an awesome unique tower defense; if you like TDs where it is all about the geometry and not about RPG elements or grinding this is a must. there is no mazing at all, but with the elaborate setups of platforms and towers you need to develop you get kind of something new here.the game feels quite unfinished and lacks some more content but still is totally worth the buy."
,Recommended,299720,22814476,"Posted: 5 May, 2016",all,Unpageable,"While this is strictly a tower defence game, the convention will only go so far as having enemies that moved in a pre-determined path and the fact that you construct towers to defeat said enemies. To succeed in this game, you must have to the mental fortitude to plan in three dimensions, as well as an abundance of creativity to maximise and extend the reach of your turrets based on limited nodes to build upon.In the first hour of play you’ll learn to construct vine like constructs to maximise your firepower, since you can only place turrets on specified nodes or extend upon them via connectors. Balancing between the reach of your foundations and your capacity to damage, you’ll glow new vines across a few strategic points, eventually connecting them all in one gigantic network. All between rounds of steadily increasing waves.The game can be mercilessly hard at higher difficulties, but it is also a rewarding experience to players that can adapt new tactics in different elevations and angles.That said, the multiplayer felt tagged on at the last minute and it suffers from sync issues when I tried it. The lack of a map editor is also a major oversight on the developer’s part, as this could have so much potential if it had workshop support; potential that was wasted simply because the devs wished to work on a newer title.If you wanted a relatively new take on the tower defence genre, you ought to give this a try. The unique visuals and catchy tunes are just icing if you happened to like the retro theme."

Defence grid two was OK .This is a breath of fresh air. I love the way you can build around the 3d route adding towers which become very powerful (along with the enemy - shapes). Takes a bit more preperation to set the camera angles. It very worth the money - dont expect an easy ride. Not a first tower defence game but the learning curve is quick. Well recommended

,Recommended,299720,22887747,"Posted: 9 May, 2016",all,baracuda csgo-dope.com,"I played many different tower defence games before but this one is the best.(+++) The biggest thing in the game giving priority for turrents. It makes everything different and more logical.--> For example:Let's say you have two weapon which can hit 80hp and you have two more which can hit 20hp. And your enemies have 100hp.In other tower defence game because they hit the nearest one;First hit make enemies hp 20 and the second enemy pass away because as everyone knows power means slowness in that kind of games. If the second powerful one hits one has 20 hp then the second enemy still has 100 hp and your 20hp weapons cannot kill it.However in this game;You can give the priority. This one will hit slowest one, this one will hit strongest one etc. This makes your game more logical and if we back the example, powerful ones hits the most strongest one then it compares 20hp with 100hp then it hits 100hp so your weak weapons can kill them.(++) Second most attractive thing is; there is not lots of nodes to build turrents. In the other games you have a path and you can build weapons on side of path. In this game you can build nodes to build more nodes or turrents. Therefore, you have to find the optimum balance for it. You can manage your money more carefully.(+) The path is 3D and this is a bit more difficult the other tower defence games.(+) Price is really funny. Kind of there is no price :)(-) Control mechanism of 3D view is weird. Sometimes I lost the game :D(-) Levels are too hard actually."

,Recommended,299720,32205395,Posted: 5 June,all,Dilapinated,"An ingenious, abstract & minimalist 3D tower defence game. Watch little geometric shapes crawl around labyrinthine objects as you build increasingly ridiculous trees of laser-death to make them explode into a rainbow of carnage.Gameplay is a mix of classic TD optimisation with plotting & extending your nodes to give the maximum amount of turrets (which each have a hemispherical firing arc) the maximum amount of roadspace to fire upon. ""just clump a bunch together around a slowing-turret"" definitely does not get you through levels alone here- Expect to fail a few times before you get the a) swing of it & b) unlocks to compete, even on easy mode. Thankfully the unlocks are frequent & generous, and can often change turrets in quite radical ways.Highly recommended, and an utter no-brainer for such a price. Mindwarping but hypnotic, minimalist but deep."

It took me a while to get used to the 3d profile and building the tower bases but the learning curve is part of the fun and challenge to most Tower D games. That is the case here as well.  A mouse is a must in my opinion.  If you are used to a track pad you could probably manage though.  You must grind a bit to unlock towers and upgrades for them,  however, they do a wonderful job of scaling it so you are grinding as you are learning and unlocking new tracks and such so It does not become a bore.  It has some kind of 3-d effect option but I have no idea how that works.  Someone more tech savvy will have to comment upon that.  The game looks great without it.The gameplay is pretty much the same as most tower d in principle.  Different 3-d shapes move around a set 3-d track.  You set towers in set places on the track and blow 'shells' - think layers- off of different shapes until there is nothing left and the shape is obliterated.  You also have a couple choices of bases that allow you to build more than one tower in a spot.  Use slows and offensive towers to kill all the shapes without running out of lives and you will beat the track.      It also has trading cards and achieves for those that are interested.  I had bought it at the super cheap price of .24 cents but it is one of the few games that I would say is worth the full price.I have yet to play the multiplayer modes and will amend my review to reflect that later.

It features multiple towers. Some have a straightforward use such as the laser towers; just shoot at the enemies. Some have a tactical use and must be placed in a certain area to maximize it's effectiveness, such as the EMP tower.The currency system awards you appropriate currency for killing enemies. You don't get under payed and you don't get over payed, so the difficulty is balanced. You must manage your money well however, or else you won't have the appropriate funds to construct much needed towers.The one thing I need to mention is that the waves' difficulties are unbalanced. Some waves I handle no problem and I'm at around 80 lives. I build even more towers than before, thinking I'm ahead of the game, and then I end up losing. I don't really understand.Also I play multiplayer on this game quite a bit and would like to see an option to give your partner some money.

,Recommended,299720,15883361,"Posted: 18 May, 2015",all,ItsFilfyD,"80 minutes in and I have to say, this game is worth the 24c I payed. But I would be disappointed if I payed the 5USD asking price (6.24AUD for me currently). As a fun tower defense game, I can say there is nothing onscreen that isn't needed. After 5 minutes I turned off all Audio ingame as it is just a small set of annoying sounds, a stock robot voice and infuriatingly annoying music. The menu music is too loud for it's own right. But, I do enjoy this game. Tower Defense games are immensely fun, and this is no exception. I would get it while it is on sale, otherwise, I would hold your money and get another TD game. This feels like it should be in early access though, so be warned. It is rough around the edges, I am unable to get Multiplayer Co-Op working, and did I mention the horrible audio effects? Yes? Well, I will until they're changed.The gun variety. This is something I would file as neutral instead of just good or bad. It has good variety, from the stock Laser turret (essentially a short burst machine gun turret) to the EMP turret which slows down enemies (but is not worth the money, keep away as it is faulted massively). I like the plama turrets. They are very nifty for when there is a distance to cover with a lot of power needed. I tend to put them near to the entry point.The EMP turret is very bad. I thought it would be helpful but took me 10 rounds to realise the geo is only slowed down until it gets shot. Why would they chose this as a design decision? It is very strange in my opinion. But the other turrets do suffice in how well they work, just stay off of the EMP.All in all, this game is fun and a good distraction, not the best TD game. Not the most well made game in general either. It's UI is about as bland as the UI from Bad Rats. And we all know how terrible that game was, dont we...If you have some money to spare from maybe some steam trading cards, go for it, it's worth a buy then. But for the $5 marking price I personally wouldn't go for it. There are plenty of other TD games out there for such a low price with much higher content and a lot more well made than this one. But for a game which you can lose hours in , I don't regret ny purchase one bit."

Yes the tower types are nothing new, and the graphics and sound are fairly sparse and simplistic. But don't let that put you off.The core idea in this TD game is to construct 'platforms' to mount your turrets to, and to maximise thier arcs of fire. You also have several targetting options to specify what the turrets should target. Combined with the map layouts, turns terrorhedron into a pretty complex game, much deeper than you usually find in this genre.This game can get pretty tough and challenging, and if you like TD then I deffo recommend giving this one a try for the low cost."

On the one hand, I suppose this system is intended to ease players into the game.  I would have preferred having everything to toy around with at the beginning; right now I'm playing the game just to unlock the types before I really start playing around with it.However, the isn't implemented into the UI well.  Locked tower types are greyed out before you've unlocked them.  The problem is that all unlocked towers stay highlighted, even when you don't have enough money to buy them.  I frequently try to buy towers when I don't have enough money, assume that I bought them, and look back to see they're not there.  There's no ""you can't buy this"" error noise, no flashing X over the button... just nothing.It would have been nice to have the prices of the towers shown above the icons rather than only display on hovering over the icon.  It would also be nice to have your total money shown on the bottom of the screen next to the ""buy"" icons so that you can see more easily how much money you have left.Also, when placing the towers, hovering over a tower placement spot should ghost the tower in and show its range.  I keep placing towers and expecting them to have their range 10-15% bigger.  It keeps feeling like tower placement spots *should* just reach a little bit longer, but they fall short fairly often.Additionally, towers can't shoot at anything below their placement plane.  I was expecting the towers to be able to shoot downward within a ~30 degree angle; most tower placement spots are absolutely useless because they can't shoot at ANYTHING below the horizontal plane they're placed in....and there's no resolution options, or framerate options.  And there's no options to turn up the shadow quality.  And there's no button in the pause screen to restart the level.  There really also could have been a way to go back to the beginning of the last wave....and there's no way to change the controls.  And the game should zoom in more for each click of the scroll wheel.  And the game should zoom in toward where the mouse is focused on the screen.

It does suck that you have to use hamachi and you can only join through IP. The price for this game is right.. but I feel like it should be free because it's a really enjoyable game for anyone who likes tower defense. Unlocking the turrets is a bit tideous and the levels can get repetitive and seem like you're just playing the same thing over and over. I will say though that it is very good and has allot of pros and not too many cons. 7.5/10 its a good game but maybe if they had servers and a steam workshop model maybe it would get a higher score.

It's pretty fun, the fundamental idea behind it is solid, but I feel like selling this as a finished product is really, really pushing it.

,Not Recommended,299720,18697823,"Posted: 26 October, 2015",all,ActionPoohole,"As a fan of the Tower Defense Genre I believe this game to be far too complicated in terms of defense layout creation.You may begin construction of your defenses upon developer chosen insert points and nowhere else. On these points you may construct either a defense tower or install a triple adaptor and/or extension in order to set up defenses for parts of the level which do not have these insert points. These adaptors can be stacked as much as you like...I have no quarrel with unlimited creativity but when it stems up, down, left and right with unlimited avenues it begins to lose its charm quite quickly as you have so much option but very little drive to do so. There is no game atmosphere to give you any reason to play...Infinite ways of stemming out from insert points creates a game based on extreme patience and testing; something I nor most of my friends have.Also, the theme of this game is very dull with simplistic cube styled levels, mostly unimaginative towers and enemies that are just difference shapes and colours to represent how much damage they can take as they travel through the maze... No, you cannot plan out the maze, only the defenses.This game just gets boring extremely quickly and doesn't allow you to do a simple restart even if you DO manage to maintain focus upon this game.If the theme was changed and each tower felt like it provided a more unique and useful design then this concept could become an okay game. The problem really is that this game is just an unimaginative geometrical bore which will most likely find you quitting not because you failed, but because you failed to get to the point of failure.This is boring and dull but could be made better with the existence of some imaginative graphics and more interesting concepts.This game I would rate a 35/100 due to its boring gameplay, unimaginative style, Lack of polish and the biggest no no of tower defense games: Leaving out a RESTART LEVEL button.There are better games out there which will provide more fun and charm, including veteran TD players."

The stacking ability for your turret mounts is a nice one, and you can get some fun builds going in all directions.I will probably tinker with this one, but some things make it not as fun as it could be.  The camera could have different control setup for one thing.  Maybe a button to swap mouse pointing and mouse camera control.  The way it is now is kind of sloppy and I find it difficult to get the camera looking at what I want and that doesnt work well if you need to build during an attack phase.It has a few flaws, but I like the concept and I will at least play it now and again.This is like a 3/5 or so."

,Recommended,299720,19508586,"Posted: 5 December, 2015",all,thedawesome,"TLDR:8/10 Great tower defense gameFull Review:Terrorhedron takes the traditional tower defense formula and adds a twist by having the game utilize three dimensions rather than the traditional two. This is an interesting change to the tower defense formula and adds a new layer of strategy. The other main difference Terrorhedron adds is the ability to build connector blocks to tower locations, meaning you can turn a single tower slot into a defensive megastructure.The music is great and really adds to the minimalist tech feel that the game provides. The enemies are all colored shapes which change depending on how many hits they can take. Towers are unlocked throughout play at a reasonable pace, I never really felt like I was grinding for a new tower or being given too many options too quickly. You can also upgrade your towers which generally provides them with a new ability rather than just a stat boost, which is great.I can't think of any real problems with this game. I have been having a ton of fun with Terrorhedron and if you are a fan of tower defense games I think you would too."
,Recommended,299720,19452157,"Posted: 2 December, 2015",all,Shawnecy,"A geometric TD game. The unique twists here are two: 1) though you have a limited number of spots upon which you can build towers, you can build structures that add more platforms for building. 2) The stage twists into three dimensions as does the platform building. This allows for some pretty cool and unique strategies.The graphics are nothing special but are fitting. Same can be said for the music. The controls are a tiny bit wonky, but nothing that really hurts gameplay. Though I believe it offers no advanced features like multi-select or such.I'm personally not a huge TD fan, but I dug this one a bit. I'd recommend this for anyone who finds at least the more popular TD games interesting.7/10"

I played for about 20 minutes and instantly fell in love. It vastly differs from other games of its kind. Whereas with typical tower defense games you have a grid or pretermined locations where you can place towers, and those towers sit there and do their thing, this game instead gives you base platforms on which you can build. You are able to construct almost tree-like structures covered in towers which you can use to obliterate your tiny foes as they attempt to progress along the little track to which they are bound. The simple graphics, chiptune music, and sheer uniqueness in the gameplay make this a great game in my opinion.10/10 would build laser trees again."

At the very least, it would be nice if there was a setting to increase the zoom speed.I have been enjoying the game quite a bit.

There are some things that could make the game better, but for the price of $2 its got all it needs.

,Recommended,299720,17242979,"Posted: 26 July, 2015",all,b e a r d h a m m e r,"WOW.  This game's awesome.  Concept's the same as all other TD games, the little creeps that you have to kill travel on a set path, and you have several fixed tower positions.  But the awesome thing is that you're able to build base blocks with MORE tower spots on them.  So let's say on a map, you've got just one tower spot to build on.  You could put a cube-shaped base block on that spot, giving you five more build spots on that block (top and the 4 sides).  On top of that cube, you could put ANOTHER cube-shaped base block, so now you've got 8 sides and 1 top build spot.*[1]  So far, I've seen the cube-shaped base block and a triangle-shaped base block, not sure if there are more to come, but with just these two, the possibilities are endless.The turrets, I have yet to get the hang of.  Sometimes I'll place a turret in a spot and think it's gonna fire and be very effective, but it just won't function at all.*[2]  But, if you build to check out the turret's firing distance/directions, and then sell BEFORE you start the round, the tower/baseblock sells for full price.  You're always getting XP and unlocking stuff, too, so losing doesn't even feel terrible.  Feels almost like I'm MORE encouraged to play as I lose, making mistakes is rewarding me with more skill.  I dunno, I love it so far.There's maybe a half hour learning curve.*[3]  The camera's tough to get the hang of at first, the UI's really barebones, and I'm not able to find a controls section (probably isn't one), but if it's possible to rotate the base blocks, I definitely want to know how.  Also turned the music off -immediately- because no sir.  Developers, if you're reading this, I can compose a far better soundtrack for you, or just let you use an instrumental album I've already written/recorded.I just can't stress enough how great the gameplay is.  Anything in this review that even sounds remotely like a drawback, it's a minor gripe that I honestly don't care about.  Bells and whistles can go to hell.  The strategy in this game is second to none.*[4]8.5/10.  Maybe a 9.  I'd give it a 10 if it came with flashier graphics (I'm picturing RUSH meets Defense Grid 2), the ability to rotate base blocks, an easier camera, and a pause button.  Took me 20 minutes to know I'll be playing this game for years to come.  Basic UI, basic graphics, and GENIUS, spectacular, limitless gameplay.July 20, 2017 Edit - I'd like to follow up on the starred and numbered statements in my original review.*[1] - The base blocks are a HUGE part of this game (to me, at least), in two massive ways.  One is that creative base block stacking and angling (which, the possibilities are truly endless) can provide you with turret build spots that maximize a turret's functionality.  One cleverly-place build spot can allow one turret to attack the enemy's path three or four different times.  Sometimes, I will stack twenty blocks to get a weird 45-degree angle overhang build spot because it can use 100% of a turret's range and get me through a ton of waves so I can save my money and be effective towards the very end.*[2] - It took a while for me to grasp the feel of turret ranges, prioritization, and firing speeds.  If a turret ever didn't function for me, it was because I was forgetting that turrets can't look down (only 360 degrees around them and up).  Like, if you cut the Earth in half along the equator, and you put a turret right in the center, it would only be able to fire ALONG the equator and north of it, never below.  And sometimes, a turret's targeting priority can make it less effective.  If you have your first turret set to attack the strongest enemy, and five of equal strength go walking past, it's going to fire at the first one, retarget the second one (because it is now the strongest) and fire, retarget the third one, and so on.  All of that time it takes to spin and aim at a new target, it's inefficient.  But prioritization solves that.*[3] - Half hour learning curve to start feeling at home and making some strong progress.  But, 100 hours of play still won't let you master the game.  You will always be strategizing and getting better.  Learning curve's low, but the skill ceiling is sky high.*[4] - SECOND. TO. NONE."

I find the camera the most annoying thing in the game. The graphics are plain and look very boring. Killing an enemy is not very rewarding because the money that you receive is based on shots, which could give you money issues. You are able to level up (character) and you will learn new towers and other things. The character level is saved forever, even if you left the game. I played on easy, which was nearly impossible already to complete the 2nd wave without losing a life. Mostly the money that you are receiving is just too low.The music is bad and more of an annoyance.Graphics are not that interesting and very simple and plain.You can sell and upgrade towers.You are able to speed up waves.Camera could be annoying after awhile. Rotations and everything. The execution of the camera is really bad.There are 5 difficulties. Easy to Very hard.You don't get alot of money whenever destroying a target.It doesn't tell you, how much money you will need in order to make an upgrade happen.Other things.None.-------------------I Give this game a 5/10"

However as much fun as this game is, it's very limited and the turrets are not balanced. The 6 maps are fun and unique, but I feel like with the same style and structure 10 maps or so should be no problem to deliver. As for the towers being imbalanced, spolier alert, if you want to play it to win you can only use the regualr turret, EMP, and laser or else you'll be wasting your money and end up losing."
