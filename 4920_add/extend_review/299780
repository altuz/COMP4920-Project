76561197976721810,Recommended,299780,10358872,"Posted: 5 June, 2014",all,Fred Lobster,"Noir Syndrome is one of those games that falls into the quirky category of ""For its price, it's pretty good."" In spite of the claims of the developer, to say that each playthrough of Noir Syndrome generates a new and unique procedurally generated Murder Mystery story is a bit of a stretch. That being said, it's still a fun puzzler that mixes in enough demand for quick reflexes, gut instincts, and the ability to bluff with confidence to make it a very worthwhile experience.In Noir Syndrome, you play an anonymous flatfoot who wakes up one day to a city under siege from the mysterious murderer Anubis. You are given 14 days to explore the city, interviewing citizens for tips and suspects, searching through garbage cans and police desks for clues, and avoiding the bullets of the police and the mob (assuming you were rude enough to tick off either party somehow). Over time, Anubis will strike again and again, reducing your score but also helping weed out suspects. Visiting crime scenes burns through your valuable time, but searching for clues and chatting with citizens burns calories, so between the actual detective work you'll need to scrounge up funds and get a bite to eat. You can also spend cash on tips from the mob, lockpicks to aid in your more ""thorough"" investigations, and bullets for taking out those who take offense at your methods.Once you have enough clues and suspects, you'll be able to narrow down the names and know for certain who your man is. Of course, if time's running short, you might be forced to make an educated guess and hope for the best; given the choice between walking into a nest of furious gunmen and placing your faith in a coinflip, sometimes half-baked detective work is really your best bet. Each game takes about 20 minutes to complete, so it's not like you aren't committed to success, but at the same time losing isn't exactly the end of the world.Eventually, the game will get a touch dull; there's only one city layout, and the number of variables they can flip around really isn't that huge. Fortunately, there are three difficulty settings which drastically affect the experience, 30 in-game Achievements to acquire that provide you with bonuses for future cases, and an alternate Dinner Party play mode that forces you to find your man in a fraction of the time of a normal game, and which unlocks a variety of goofy costumes (always a solid selling point).Noir Syndrome accomplishes all this with a presentation better suited for an NES than a radio serial broadcast. It might not scratch any authentic murder-mystery itches, but it's a clever little puzzler that's well worth the price of admission."
,Recommended,299780,10792492,"Posted: 25 June, 2014",all,Raiseo Hitsu,"Well isn't this a nice little game, a creative idea executed fairly well.The idea behind it is you're a private investigator in a violent town, trying to arrest an assassin. As a result, you investigate this filthy town while trying to stay alive.The clues are randomly placed in the environment and you have to investigate every nook and cranny to get the clues that will reveal who the true culprit is. Some clues are more decisive than others, for example, a bullet casing may indicate the culprit is a Mobster or a member of the Police, while a Police ID precisely tells you the culprit affiliation.You have to figure out 3 things : Affiliation (Civilian, Mobster, Policeman), Job (Driver, Chef, etc.) and Sex (Male or Female).Of course you can just guess and try an arrest but if you get it wrong you fail.As to how gather suspects, you have to talk to the people in various places, crime scenes don't have people lingering about but have generally more clues and some events make people amass in a place, particularly if they're from one affiliation.Anyway, this becomes quite important when playing a higher difficulty than normal, because either the police or the mob want you dead, so the investigation becomes much harder with shootouts, especially since bullets are limited and costly, that's why it's wise to avoid places where the affiliation that wants you dead hangs out.Bullets aren't the only thing that can kill you however, hunger can as well, you have to manage your money to buy the right resources like lockpicks, bullets or food to survive, everytime you investigate or talk with someone you get hungrier until you die.Some places need lockpicks to explore fully and you can even rob some places where hopefully you don't get spotted or you make another faction your enemy.Everytime you start a new game, the culprit and the clues are randomized, as is the faction that hunts you down, the events of course are randomized too, as is the place you can find clues.The gameplay is free and you can go whenever you want mostly, but you have a time limit in days to catch the culprit... or you might just go on a murder spree.All in all this is a repeatable noir detective story with a great soundtrack and a great feel to it. Recommended, but might get old pretty fast."

There are murders which produce crime scenes; this could have been cool - it could have featured a chalked out body with higher probability of clues, and witnesses to question. Instead, you get the same area, and gameplay simply boils down to pressing Z all over a few locations until you have enough clues to blame-by-logic.Feels like an iPhone game, plays like a free flash tite."

In this game, you solve cases by asking questions and finding clues, but the way you do so is redundant. How do you find clues? Rather than actually looking for a clue, you just press the 'Z' button whenever you stand near something interactable and hope you get lucky enough to get a clue. In other words, you don't find clues in this game; you just wait until the game decides to hand you a clue. How do you get information out of people? The same exact way. Press 'Z' and hope they give you information. No story, no dialogue options, just a 'Z' button. A successful detective game needs to make the player feel like they are actually solving the case themselves. Make them find the clues; make them interrogate suspects. Don't reduce everything a good detective game needs to one simple button. This game is playable, but the shallow gameplay will ultimately lead you to let the game sit in your library untouched for a long time."

Ask around to find suspects, and narrow down your list by finding clues to the muderer's identity. Try to avoid the wrath of the police and the mob, because they'll kill you on sight. Or play the dinner party mode, where you're locked in with the killer, and the other guests occasionally go mad and kill you. Collect badges to level up your subsequent characters, and play on three difficulty modes, all of them challenging. Noir Syndrome is great fun with procedurally generated mysteries that usually don't last longer than ten minutes, but there are some obvious flaws.Controls are fully rebindable, as they always should be in a PC game. There are only five action keys, but a couple would have been helpful. The ""investigate"" key handles all actions except shooting, which is quite annoying when someone is standing in front of an object you want to investigate or a door you want to enter, but the game insists on making you talk instead.The interface is a bit clunky as well. Using multiple screens to try to manage a very small amount of information on the suspects is rather ridiculous. The game doesn't let you cross off suspects who don't match the clues you've gathered, and you can't un-designate a culprit once you've selected one (though you can change which one you'll arrest if you talk to him or her).The tutorial is bare-bones; some will appreciate learning the mechanics on their own, but it would have been nice to learn more before being thrown into the game. On the whole, though, there's a lot of pixelly fun to be had here."

Sadly the result is a bland experience.The clues, suspects, and locations where something can be found are random, this also means that the story -- such as it is -- makes no sense at all. What this leads to is a detective game where you don't care about the story and you just go about at random.And the gameplay just isn't interesting. Everywhere you go it is the same. Walk up to someone or something and press Z. Walk up to the next person or thing and press Z. Shoot and kill someone with X. Z, walk, X, walk, Z, Z.Good concept, but sadly lacking execution."

The game gives few instructions beyond basic controls, leaving the player to figure out not only the mysteries at hand but how to solve those mysteries. What is frustrating in many games is actually very fun here. Since each case is so quick (about ten-fifteen minutes at most), you don't feel like you've wasted time if you make a mistake (I accidentally shot a cop in my first game and accidentally robbed the mob in my second) and have to start over.There's room for improvement, personally I'd love to see ""Dinner Party mode"" made more than just the standard game in one locale and the cases can get repetitive after a while but the game is totally worth it at this price point."
76561197980503707,Not Recommended,299780,12516821,"Posted: 16 October, 2014",all,Zaimad,"First of all, let's get something out of the way: this game was QUITE CLEARLY made for a device such as a tablet. Now that that's out of the picture, Noir Syndrome is a very strange take on what one could call the detective games' genre.Gameplay is a simple ""look for clues"" ritual, where you click the investigate button near a backdrop and have the potential of finding evidence that points you in the direction of one of the suspects or you click the same button near a person and talk to them, potentially adding someone to your suspects' list. The reason this is quirky is because at the end of a session you may not have had either enough evidence to point you to the real culprit (and thus force you to guess who the culprit is for the session) or, and this one's a real pain and somewhat usual phenomenon, you don't even have the culprit on your suspects' list yet; if this is the case, you have lost, period.Other game mechanics are a hunger system, where you are forced to interact with salespeople to get food of various qualities for differing prices, a wanted system, where either or both the police and the mob are out to get you, and essentially a pressuring system where at some points during the game the culprit will send hitmen out to kill you. There's also a ""quest"" system so you can earn a little more money either by killing assigned targets or delivering mail to the intended recipient, but for both of those you need to have found the respective items to access the quest givers via the quirky random chance while inspecting the background, which is the main source of your character getting hungry by the way...Noir Syndrome comes with three difficulty modes where the main factors are how awful are your starting conditions and how expensive every commodity in the game is. Yes, that steak isn't going to pay itself in Impossible Mode if you haven't been improving your money-hoarding skill that persists through different game sessions, so you'll have to start at Easy and work your way towards it....Which, after all, is Noir Syndrome's greatest sin. The game is awfully very much about strategy and luck, as you have to choose which areas you go into in order to get clues while taking into account if the police or the mob have a chance to be represented in the area, and also managing your scarce money to buy bullets, lockpicks and the ever-important food at different locations. But after you've raised your money-hoarding skills to the point of making money become just another number you casually look at while at the hardest of difficulties, it's almost like you're playing on Easy again if you have the right strategy, and the game becomes once again about how lucky you are to find the clues you need. This makes Noir Syndrome fit into the category of mindless fun: at some point, you'll be doing something mechanical, taking the same options as you play essentially the same game over and over again. And it can stop being fun to become boring.As you've noticed, I don't recommend this game. The reason? It simply isn't worth the full cost, and it hinges on your willingness to continue grinding away until the game becomes ""easy enough"" at each of the difficulties you'll be playing in. If the game was somehow grander, most of the clues less redundant and/or less narrowing, or if the ideal strategy wasn't too mechanical to the point of almost making you shut out cognitive thought and forcing you to reacquire it when something immediate happens (such as a very innoportune hitman that once killed triggers the police/mob to want to gun you down), I would have recommended this game because it is, surprisingly, fun to go around poking random stuff for random clues which may or may not be enough to catch the culprit."

,Recommended,299780,11142843,"Posted: 8 July, 2014",all,Laini,"Noir Syndrome is a procedurally generated Detective-Em-Up and it's a heck of a lot of fun.The mechanics are fairly simple. you basically move from location to location hitting Z (to search) on everything to gather clues, suspects and various items.The fun comes from taking these clues and trying to work out who the culprit is.Your Notebook gathers all your clues together along with any suspects you've learnt about.It's then about eliminating suspects who don't match the clues.For example, one clue might belong to either a Poet or an Artist so you know the killer has to be someone with either of those hobbies.The killer and the clues are randomised every game, although the locations are always the same.You'll also find money, bullets and lockpicks as you search each location.Although a playthrough might only take 20 minutes or so there's a lot to come back to.Beyond simply trying to track down the killer there are various other side things to do.For example, one area houses a vault that's been sealed shut for 100 years. Tempting, no?There's also a more condensed mode called Dinner Party where you and all the suspects are locked in one location.Here you already know all the suspects including their affiliation (Civilian, Mob or Police) and their hobbies so all you need to do is hunt down the clues and piece them together.Although it seems being cooped up together does take it's toll on the guests, over time they go a little crazy and need to be avoided (or shot) until they cool down.Aside from the two main modes there are also in game Badges to unlock for completing various objectives, such as closing five cases or visiting 100 crime scenes.Each game also offers an individual challenge, fire 10 bullets for example.Unlocking badges and completing challenges give the player permanent bonuses for future games, such as starting with an extra lockpick.Oh and there are costumes to unlock too.The soundtrack is superb as well.On the downside, the gameplay is really simple. You talk, you search, you shoot and you unlock. That's it.I think it helps that there are side objectives to do but if you're looking for something really deep you won't find it here.Although each game technically is different there's not a lot that changes between playthroughs.The clues, suspects and killer will be different yes but this doesn't really mean as much as you might think.You'll still be doing the same things regardless. You choose a location to visit, you hit Z on everything and then you have a look at your Notebook before moving on.There's also no real logic to the clues. You find them anywhere, regardless of whether it makes sense to do so or not. Sometimes murders happen as you play and an area is marked as a crime scene but all this means is the area will empty on that day. You won't necessarily find a lot of clues in that area for example.The Hunger mechanic can be a bit of a pain too, you lose hunger every time you do something (even searching in an area you can't find anything in for example, or searching the same area twice). This has been improved now that the Notebook states hunger as a number though. Before that update it simply said ""Hungry"" or ""Full"" without giving any indication how much longer you could go without eating anything.Also it's a really minor thing but it'd be nice to be able to score people off the suspect list.Overall though, I'd recommend it for sure."

It would be fun if it had a story mode or a better tutorial, but for now it's alright. Worth the money I payed for it (£1.69).There are procedurally generated cases, but that only goes as far as the murder victims, clues and suspect names.

The dinner party mode is insane though, as you're exploring a house where people randomly go homicidal while you're trying to hunt clues and find a culprit.I won't recommend this to everyone, but if you like detective stories or logic puzzles and the freedom to bop around, it's a nice pick up and play game."

That said, on both formats it is a lot of fun.Gameplay consists mainly of picking a location in the town (not randomly generated), then talking to people and searching everywhere there. (You can also shoot people, pick locks to gain access to more areas, buy things, steal things...) Talking adds suspects to your list and sometimes gives other hints; searching finds equipment, cash and clues. Suspects and clues are randomly generated and are added to your notebook; when you think you have figured out who is the murderer is, track them down and arrest them.Its very rogue-like-like; each playthrough may last only 5-10 minutes, but you learn more about the game as you play and can level your character up by earning achievement ""badges"" to get more starting gear and better drops on later games. You don't have to ""win"" a game to get credit towards levelling up. Over time you learn more about the town and where to find food, gear, best places to talk to people or search for clues etc. Some locations are definitely more useful than others.Combat can be entirely avoided (you won't be attacked unprovoked unless on hard mode, even then its avoidable) but is frantic and fun when it happens despite the simple interface. Its definitely NOT the focus of the game, you should be talking to people to get a list of suspects and search for clues. There is other stuff to do in the town too - gamble with the mob or steal their loot, raid the vault in the old fort, etc.The difficulty is entirely player controlled, once you start to level up and figure out where things are, you can start tackling some of the harder achievements and give hard mode a try.One warning: You should remap the default controls and change X for shoot to another key that you can get to quickly, but not press by accident. S works well. I've killed people by accident when trying to press Z."

Its simple graphics and music don't harm the game in anyway, in fact it suits it just fine, but the excessive simplicity of its core mechanics prevent it from being a better game.In the main game mode you have to find who the murder is on a limited set of days. You do this by visiting various places on the city map, going from place to place as you collect evidence and questioning suspects, until you'r ready to point who's the culprit and arrest him. If in paper this sounds interesting, truth is that the gameplay fails to establish any significant connection between you and the game. You basically side-scroll your way through the levels constantly pushing ""Z"" hoping to find any clue or money randomly hidden on the set.Also, the fact that this is a rougelike does little for the game. It doesn't offers enough replay value and, in any way, it compensates for the lack of narrative depth.Still the biggest problem the game faces it's being on PC.

A detective game that randomizes clues, victims and suspects just sounded really intriging, but that's also the source of every single fault with the game.Noir Syndrome is a perfect example of all the Cons of random generation:1) its simplified down to just 3 aspects of the murderer, and the clues needed to pin some one are entierly unrelated to ""crime scenes"", thier intent, or thier life- you can find them just lying around any where after pressing the ""Z"" button enough times as you walk around, and finding a clue does not lead you to another. ""WOW, found dress shoes at the church? thats a clue. the killer must be a dancer or driver""2) the generator is borked. for the main game i havent had an issue other then being unable to find useful clues or suspects to accuse, but cranking up the difficulty or playing the extra""dinner Party"" mode has given me times where 2 or more suspects are the same in every way, even in name. that right thier is a deal breaker.http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/3278934346172286700/67CE738813FDDDE7923EB4754657E10BD121DFC8/when the only diffrence between people is thier occupation, gender, and mob/cop/civilian faction, its unexceptable to allow 2 people to have all 3 in common.3) unrefined difficulty curve. the solution to the game is the same every time. you find 5 clues, and gather as complete a suspect list as you are able- then look over your ""clues"" for something like ""is civillian or Mobster"" AND ""is Mobster or Cop"" to find some one to fit the bill. the only restriction is hunger. every time you act you loose invisible food points, and you can starve. so in higher difficulties you need to first get money for food... which wouldnt be bad- things get more expensive and some factions are already willing to gun you down on sight, so you have more reason to sneak around, Steal or shoot first. that'd make the game worth it if you didnt also loose hunger points for TALKING to FoodVendors and using doors. thats dumb. you shouldnt get penalized for walking in/out, buying food, or talking to the  same person multiple times if you only get new information the first.4) poor convayance. it took me a while to notice that the locations actually have a functionality besides just being  were events happen. you usually get a notice each ""day"" that something of interest is happening at a location- Mob TakeOver, PoliceZone, social hub, crime scene... you can only tell what each means by going there several times (crimeScenes have No npc's, Mob takeover's have only mob members there that day), and just because it's flashy doesnt have any impact over how usfull it is- ie, if you are looking for a male Mobster chef, the game doesnt do much to inform you that asking mob members nets you More mob suspects... or nets you more NON-Mob suspects. you cant tell, and you wouldnt just roam around learning about each location's specific resources unless you are directed there by an event.given that information, How much did you enjoy Clue? becuase until some of that stuff is fixed this is all its good for. it saddens me that this could have been something really worth replaying on higher difficulties, but ugh... no."

I have been in situations where I have all the clues and cannot find someone to give me proper suspects. Even worse is that you can be in a situation where there are two equally valid choices. The clues only narrow down gender, affiliation (police, civilian, or mobster), and potential job. I've had it where two characters had the exact same characteristics. The game is too heavily based on luck with the only option to actually figure out who the person might be is through spending a large amount of cash on the mobster tip option. Finding the culprit within a short amount of time is nearly impossible. The game also makes a big deal about ""those who are dead, stay dead."" What that means is that if there are a string of murders, you're suspect list might get shorter but in the multiple games I've played, has had almost no effect. Everything resets when you start a new case, so that means they don't really stay dead. They're just not there on that case.Ultimately the main game is not worth much except maybe a few tries if this goes on a heavy sale. Even at the relatively cheap price, you're paying too much. I will admit the mansion minigame that gets unlocked once you luckily solve one case is a bit more fun. In that, you have the full suspect list and have to find the clues. You also have to worry about the people in the mansion temporarily going insane and trying to kill you. The same issue of multiple suspects meeting the exact sime criteria for the clues unfortunately hurts even this fun mode. You also have to worry about the failure state induced by killling the actual murderer rather than arresting them.

,Recommended,299780,10850302,"Posted: 26 June, 2014",all,The Guy,"I guess it's a neat gimmick, but there isn't much there. There's two gamemodes, the regular gamemode where you have to get suspects and clues to find the murderer, and dinner party, where you have all the suspects, need clues, and the suspects will go mad and try to kill you from time to time. It's fun, but I find that the gap between difficulties is a bit boggling. Normal difficulty is hardly challenging, with you being able to solve cases in literal minutes if you move fast. But on hard it's a pain to juggle not starving, getting clues, and getting suspects all at the same time. After what I experienced in hard, I haven't touched impossible, as it probably lives up to the name. You can complete challenges and collect badges for doing stuff in game, but it gets old kind of fast, and once you've done all that stuff, it's down to collecting hundreds of pieces of costume scraps, of which there are only a small handful of styles. And once that's done, well, there isn't really anything else to do. But as a quick little pick up and play game or a collectathon, it does pretty good."

It's not a roguelike, per se, but playing it kinda feels like roguelike play. It's definitely not fair but, hey, that's the life of a hardboiled detective, babycakes."

However, I can't say that the game lives up to my expectations. I could have tolerated the fixed map/places (only the culprit and clues are generated), but the gameplay is too dry and shallow. It plays like this, choose a place, go there and press z and collect clues (which mostly don't make sense,for example you can find a fingerprint on a paint that wasn't even in the crime scene and claim that fingerprint belongs to the murderer), then go to another one do the same etc etc. No dialogues, little room for thinking,good but limited soundtrack. I don't have any problem with pixel art graphics (I can even say that I'm biased in favor of them) but the ones in the game just don't have that ""art""y quality.Well, I don't regret buying this game as I still think this is an interesting theme and I'm happy to support the developer, and it is not completely dull either, but still it lacks depth and content, so mind that when you are buying it."

You will have to travel through locations and ask the people around for answers. You will only have a couple of days until the case needed to be solved. You will have to search through objects to see if you are able to find any clue about the killers. You will only have 1 chance to arrest or kill the target.The idea is great. But it didn't turn out so well.Retro graphicsGame is okayCould be interesting.Not alot of high replay value.Other things.None.-------------------I Give this game a 5/10
,Not Recommended,299780,35171124,Posted: 23 September,all,Melovinci,"Upon playing Noir Syndrome, I did question the meaning of “procedurally generated”. When I think of procedural generation, I think of something like Diablo, or Don’t Starve, not to mention all the rogue-like games out there. The point of procedural generation in games is to create a world which varies just enough to allow re-playability.The way this works is very simple. You talk to people and collect a list of suspects. Once you have enough evidence, and through the process of elimination, you can arrest some one on your list. That is essentially the game. It reminds me somewhat of Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego, where you gather descriptors of your villain to finally arrest them.Asides from the main mystery, you can try to complete challenges (for example, use a lockpick five times), collect costumes, hunt bounties, as well as ensuring you are well-fed (using money you gain from bounties or find in the world). You can also use your gun if need be. But these are all little things that have been added to the game in an attempt to create depth without actually doing so. When it comes down to it, all this extra is for naught.When you solve the case, game over. If you want to replay, you start from scratch, with the killer being randomly generated, along with all the suspects and evidence. In reality, this game is not procedurally generated, rather it has a randomly generated outcome. In effect, the world, the mystery, and the story do not change from one game to the next, only the clues you use to solve them.I think the effort put into making this game procedurally generated has, in turn, detracted from any of the noir-ish qualities it should have. Because it’s procedurally generated, characters don’t have personalities, or even distinguished faces (the pixel graphics are far from slick). While an intro sets the serial killer up to be some Egyptian cult fanatic, nothing more is ever mentioned or resolved around it.Setting something in the mid-20th century, with Speakeasys, diners and the mob are not enough to make something “noir”. It’s the cynicism of the protagonist, the fatalism of the femme fatale, or the moral ambiguity of the resolution. Noir Syndrome does not have a story at all, let alone any of these things. The “noir” concept is a skin applied to a simple puzzle game.But the soundtrack is at least jazzy.Noir Syndrome is a little puzzle distraction in the same vein as Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?. There is not a huge amount of depth to the puzzle, to the world, or to the re-playability, so I would hold off on buying the game for full-price, or perhaps buy the Android version instead."
