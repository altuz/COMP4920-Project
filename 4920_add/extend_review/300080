I have no problem paying for a game, that's not the point. but the structure of any evolution requires so much time or money that either you spend a fortune or your gameplay will be mostly a waiting and watching experience. I also have serious doubts about the honesty of the game. I haven't won a single battle for a week, no matter the size of my army or the opponent force. digging for stone has become impossible due to some weird limitations (too high, too low...)  I'm kind of stuck. this game will be deleted by the end of the day"

More than once there has been nail biting victories and defeats. I haven't played any pvp duels. It does play like Red Tides Art of War against the ai. I don't think its as good as Red Tides Art of War which plays similarly, but it was worth the $6."

I play the game like a true man or woman and don't turn into them Pay to Win people who likes to spend money on 50 Gold. Quite Addictive to be honest, BUT I want to see more community listening not ignoring the community.Devs need to listen to the community, see their opinions on how to change games like these. It can help a bunch.And If possible, maybe have these Realms styled a bit more differently compared to otherplayer's Realms.*GREAT GAME KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AND KEEP THIS GAME HAPPY AND ALIVE!*Also, I really hope this game will get future Updates. Especially updates like adding a Chat to talk to other people, or even, specific Units. or at least customizable."

The entire crafting process, taking completely too long and producing poor results (seven consecutive master craft sessions produced six blue and only one green), is designed to frustrate you and have you give up and spend money to get the item instead. The battle function is basic and depends much more on the strength of the army than any strategies of the commander. The AI battles quickly become repetitive.  After spending many enjoyable hours playing Medieval Total War, this is a real disappointment."

,Not Recommended,300080,29768919,Posted: 7 February,all,Hobby_goat17,"I'll recomend it after the fix duels and the other crazy thing -> they could understand live without facebook. Steam has privacy of everything or everyday.But that baffles me when you play a game which has complex stragedy almost like online risk.That game was more fun this one there you could go and conqueror live players this one your stuck in limbo doing what tutorial asks you do never leveling up your castle to rank 2. Which baffles me, there no opt out of tutorial from steam, seems to gold spending game, as everyone puts it spend to win.I tried to figure it out why. labeled this stragedy maybe they should relabel it money making scheme sort of game.  Eventually you do if you don't spend anything on free time you earn 35 gold it doesn't really help try to use it get silver that way.8 hours to up rank your castle  and then bandits and like assault you while your away seems kind of fishy.Dueling is never fixed, if they fix it they could alert the players say hey we fixed dueling so no need to leave our game.No update on that means they either abandoned it or left us to wander and play viking outposts seems be where people at, save your gold for that.Don't spend it on changing the seaons which 35 gold and 5,10, 15 for advisor he helpful yes but still spending time with him means you have to have him for battles so you don't loose.I do believe there aren't achievements in this game that is missing, so you not gain anything playing it not even cards.Which would been cool..but that just me putting it out there.Game overall experience 75%  wish it was better Graphics really cool, sound too, It kind of reminded me of  Game of thrones without crazy aspect of it."
