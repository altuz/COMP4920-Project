Ok, where to start? The menu is very basic, you have your new game, load game, and close game, and this game is only fit to one resolution which that is 480p though the game still looks good in this resolution. Their are no options to edit the settings of this game which is kinda of a dissapointment, and the story itself when you first play the game is not all that impressive. It just throws you in with no backstory. You end up going to an old man's house and defeating a creature while a witch from a kingdom turns you into a girl and your friend a butterfly. No character development is obvious. This is though a very fun game, the combat is refreshing (though they could've added a enemy's hp) as well as open world, classic rpg, turn based strategy game; however so far for this first impression, I can not simply recommend this game."

And by that, I mean this seems like someone's first attempt at making one of these games, and they seem to have done adequate. The plot is a bit contrived, but decent enough. Through a bit of comedic timing, you William, are turned into a girl because your boss/friend decided to insult a witch... who turned him into a butterfly. Note: You said nothing to the witch for good or ill...Now you seek a way to turn yourself back... while also changing the world... because that's the way things are done.Will you succeed? Probably. But it will be fun while you try!"

While the game is certainly shallow and lacking in any real creativity, and can be finished in just a few hours, if you want an interesting RPG that won't take a hundred hours to complete you might find Victim of Xen a quick diversion. Yes, the focus on the game is on a boy being ""cursed"" to become a girl and his quest to get turned back. That alone was almost enough for me to turn my back on it, but I'm always open to at least giving it a shot. There's some political intrigue and world saving, but we've seen that already in numerous better (and longer) RPGs. I would certainly not recommend this game at full price, but if you can get it for at least half off it might be worth your time. In short, it's a mediocre title at best and a waste of money at worst."

The enemies could use more diversity since some areas have two to three normal enemies and then one overpowered assassin which goes down if you stay there and grind for a bit.The audio is pleasing on the ears. Battle and field music is simple and relaxing to listen to.The story itself could use some work here and there but with a bit of polishing I think the game could be better.In short, the main character is transformed into a girl and has to learn to deal with it as the story progresses along."

A Solid game, 7/10Story, 6/10 enough to keep you interested, but rather unclear and missleading at times, its hard to separate the good guys from the bad-guys.Gameplay, 8/10 combat is even at early levels, and evens out mid-game, my only complain is that some enemies hit too hard, keeping half your team focused on mending damage rather then causing it.Sounds, 5/10 Basic sound effects, the music is soothing and non-intrusive making it easy to listen to even if somewhat repeative, but not too annoying, I would still recommend playing some of your own choice music in the background, you can turn off the background music by hitting F1 and turning it off. As for sound effects, apart from a few sounds in and out of combat, nothing amazing.Worth the money if you have NOTHING better to play and are looking to kill 2-3 hours of your time over a few weeks."

,Not Recommended,300220,17554086,"Posted: 15 August, 2015",all,Gezzie,"I must say: This game didn't have a very strong first impression, but I did perservere and made it to the end.One big lasting note throughout the length of this game (which taking it generally at a medium pace took me less than six hours, which, is downright laughable for an RPG) is that most of the assets seemed to be taken from RPG Maker. Almost no custom work, but I guess that could be excused if the game had a strong story and RPG assets. Does it?Ehhhh no, not at all... and I'll just break it down.- THE STORY -The story was probably the only thing that made me gather any remote interest in this game. Pretty much the story is about a (knight?) guy named William who basically gets to be in a game of body-juggling. On his mission to rid an imp in some elderly guy's basement he gets in the way of Xen, the witch in the kingdom of Opress. She gets annoyed of his friend and for some reason Xen zaps both of them (I honestly have no idea why, Will didn't taunt Xen in any way) changing Xen into a girl. The meat of the story is thrown in your face throughout the first half of the game: You are a girl and you want to be changed back. There's an underlying story of the war that should be stopped but honestly it's put in the background until the last hour of the game.I don't recall playing RPGs where being a girl generates so much negative attention like in this game though. There are a good percent of people in the game that seem to just make sexist jokes towards you. Either way, most of the storyline is pretty cliche, and I honestly forgot most of it even after playing it. I honestly don't even remember most of your followers' names since they don't really garner any interest. There are people who seem to just get in your way for no reason and some of the plots actually never conclude (like the plot between William and his mother).- THE COMBAT -The combat is pretty bad... just laying that out there. I feel like the combat was just taked on for more length because in a game as short as this one, getting to level 10 is an achievement. Most of your partners share the same attacks so there's no variety. Swords are really the only useful weapons (because the five strongest weapons are SWORDS), and if you get the best piece of armour (for only 500 gold), you win.Oh, and should I mention getting those best swords is so easy it's laughable? You can easily wipe through all the combat with one (I assume) missight if you go to the port town at the BEGINNING of the game, go to the wood shop, do the job there countlessly, and earn infinite gold. To put it clearly, I spent an hour doing the job, and earned enough to give my party the best armour and weapons AN HOUR into the game. This made all the combat pretty much pointless. It's bland enough anyway that I just kept hitting enter throughout most of the game and only lost like two battles.One thing though, is you should get good weapons before going off to Unitem (or whatever it's called) because when you get to Oasis, you either need a lot of gold or strong weapons to defeat a boss on the island. I made the mistake of only getting armour to that point on the first playthrough and I was essentially stuck because there was no way to get better weapons and no way to earn gold. Had to start the game over.Now, I know the majority of this review was negative, but it's honestly hard for me to remember any good points of the game. One good point I guess is that there's a lot of side quests (but they're almost all fetch quests that give you gold) and the dialogue is somewhat passible. Either way, I can list more flaws but I'd just rather play a better game in this genre because it's obviously taking roots from other, much better JRPGs like Final Fantasy or the Zeboyd games.OVERALL RATING: 3/10(If there's anything that I missed, feel free to notify me in any way. Keep in note that I write these reviews immediately after finishing the game.)"
,Not Recommended,300220,18161030,"Posted: 23 September, 2015",all,tettsui77,"I really can't recommend this... (TL;DR below)At first I found the game enjoyable, and I liked the things that set it apart from the glut of RPGMaker games on Steam (specifically, the ""Battle Ready"" mechanic).  Several hours in, though, the game has become a boring slog that I really can't see myself finishing.  After the initial enjoyment was long gone, I still wanted to complete the game (that's how I roll) and ALSO get the last 2 Achievments.  I literally don't think I'll be able to bring myself to load this one up, ever again...The other reviews here have really hit on just about every point I could hope to... but I do want to reiterate just a few points, and bring up a few complaints of my own.1) The writing of this game is just absolutely ABYSSMAL.  In the beginning of the game, it was fine if not inspired, but it becomes abundantly clear they just ran out of steam and had a ""let's get this f*ckin thing finished"" mindset.  It seems the devs wanted ""to make a RPG"" -- NOT that they had a story they wanted to tell.2) The characters are unrelatable at best, and obnoxious at worst.  I'd been playing this game pretty frequently (as my in-game time should demonstrate) up until the last week or so (when it became too much to bare) ... and I *literally* cannot think of but *TWO* of their names aside from Xen herself (Will and Markus -- so inspired!)...3) There are spelling and grammar errors CONSTANTLY.  I wouldn't go so far as to say that a few small errors here and there would ruin the game or anything (hell, even some of the Square classics had 'em) -- but when it's a constant thing it is a HUGE hurdle to immersion.  The script seems to have never been proofread in the least, and the game itself most likely never legitimately play-tested.  The nature of some of the errors leads me to believe the (text file format) script was run through spellcheck and called good... (""you'll FREE to death""?!)4) The title screen -- THE FIRST THING PEOPLE SEE WHEN THEY BOOT UP THE GAME -- is so bland and uninspired I can't wrap my head around it.  It's like... a (stolen?) cropped image of a pseudo-Medieval European cityscape, run through a filter, with ""Victim of Xen"" in plain ol' text in the middle.  This actually didn't occur to me until after I started to realize how totally sh*t the game is.  WHAT DOES THIS TITLE SCREEN HAVE TO DO WITH THE GAME?!  WHY COULD YOU NOT DRAW, *SOME* SORT OF SIMPLISTIC LOGO OR INCLUDE *SOMETHING* WITH *ANY* RELEVANCE TO THE GAME?!  Oh, I know why... because the devs DID NOT CARE about this game at all.  Again... ""get this f*ckin thing done"" mindset is my only answer.5) The world map is tiny, cluttered, and cliche... and does not loop around on itself.  Literally, you get to the edges of the world map and there are invisible walls.  There is no in-game lore explaining any of this, either.6) And, really, there is just NO IN-GAME LORE OR WORLD-BUILDING *AT ALL*.   If the devs don't care, how could expect the players to?I could go on and on, about how the art assets are stolen, most likely the music as well... and how there are MUCH better games on Steam in somewhat similar mold that are FREE... but all of that has been said, and I'd just never finish!So yeah... great job Smolders... you ""made a RPG""... which seems to have been your ONLY goal with this project.  Thankfully these devs have not released anything since... and God willing they WON'T.TL;DR: Go download ""Eternal Senia"" instead if you want a game that uses generic RPGMaker tiles and scavenged art assets.  What's the difference, you ask?  Well.. that game is FREE... and HAS A STORY TO TELL... and IT IS FUN.  FUN is something the developers of ""VOX"" seem to have *entirely* glossed over on their bullet-pointed ""Things To Include In The Game"" list."

,Not Recommended,300220,16272745,"Posted: 9 June, 2015",all,Mofuji,"This was made simply to sate the desire on the part of somebody to make a game around the fetish of gender bending and body transformation, with the contrivances of a bare bones, barely thought out plot tossed on to try and disguise the fetishistic nature of what it is.The plot does not exist, the combat is nothing interesting, lacking in anything to make it more than a mere chore, something that must be done to simply continue with the farce of a plot. When something actually story related pops up, it's quickly dealt with in such a manner that it contributes nothing at all while leaving you with more questions than anybody involved in writing wanted to answer. It all calumniates in an ending that is equal parts generic, cliché, dull and ultimately, answers nothing at all. It leaves you with an empty feeling inside.The only reason why anybody has several hours in this game is for the achievements, most of which are based entirely around grinding. Without those, this would barely be a three hour game, if that. There is nothing at all for anybody in this so called game; RPG fans will find the plot shallow, anybody who wants easy achievements will find themselves bored to tears and those with the certain fetishes listed above will likely find themselves not satisfied because it's very watered down to try and appeal to a larger audience.If you're still going to get this, do so when it's on sale, because it's not worth the 3 USD."
