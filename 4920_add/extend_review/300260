It is worth approx $1.99 in its current skeleton state. This product is barely in pre-production Alpha stage.WARNINGPlanetoid Pioneers is not a game in its current state it is not even a demo it is more of a Showcase of what can be done in the future and has very limited liability and almost no content.With that said, the game is beautiful and I have high hopes for its future if the developer and the community can unite and build a wonderful game together a game that is what Cortex Command should have been.I cannot write a negative review of this game because you are clearly warned in the intro video not to buy this game therefore I must give a positive review using forward-thinking and hoping that this game will eventually become good, I pray to God that it will one day be finished, unlike its predecessor, Cortex Command.You may wonder why does my review not contain specific information about the gameplay well the reason is there is literally so little content that I have nothing to say because there is almost nothing there.WARNINGDo not buy this game unless it is two to three years from now and you're reading this review and the game is actually completed."

This game is a LOT of fun! I have been playing coop with my son, and I'm not sure we have ever laughed so hard while playing a video game together. That alone was worth the price of admission! Me and my son love Cortex Command, as quirky and difficult a game as it is. Planetoid Pioneer shares some of those same idiosyncrasies which is what makes the game outstanding among a sea of otherwise cookie-cutter video games. While we don't have a lot of time in the game we are looking forward to spend many more hours exploring, getting in each other's way, and shooting undead skeletons and other creatures through the head! For $10 you can't go wrong - bugs and all. The developer is great and active on the Steam forums! $10? Don't be a fool! Spend it!"

Despite being early access, there was enough content already to keep me occupied for a fair amount of time, and I've only been playing on just 1 of the planet(oid)s so there's still more to enjoy. Even more fun with a sibling, although friendly fire needs adding ASAP.For EA, it is surprisingly polished. I haven't encountered many game breaking bugs if any at all. As far as I can tell, the game has most of its core systems in place and is ready to be built on, which tempts me to get the contributor edition as I like the thought of creating my own content, especially with the resources provided (check out the guides page to see what you can do in greater detail).If you like sandbox builders, physics based gameplay, local multiplayer shenanigans and violent bodily dismemberment then get this game already."

Also, playing multiplayer with family and friends has never been more hilarious and fun...I have 3 xbox controllers plugged into computer, and playing this on a 55 inch TV is awesome.I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for entertainment."
76561198035865217,Recommended,300260,22544181,"Posted: 20 April, 2016",all,Wardiaper,"This is NOT a game.  This is a game engine.  A wonderful 2D game engine that has that Cortex Command physics, pixel eating magic, kind of procedural character movement.  From the guides looks like easy to make objects and characters, LUA scripting, sharing via workshop (embedded in PNGs), level (terrain) editing with all kinds of deformations to make your round planets with caves and radial gravity (I think that's what it's called with gravity in the center of the planet), or regular gravity to make a side scrolling game or level, or no gravity for a top down game or level.There is a learning curve, maybe more because of the LUA scripting if you are dumb like me, but so far having fun just blowing up stuff, playing with the rovers, the grappling hook, the jet pack, the different guns that are already in the game (like the bee gun).  I am going to try to learn some scripting and make something terrible.If you like playing with game engines as much as games and have $40 burning a hole in your pocket this might be for you.  If not, just wait a couple of years for the game this engine creates.  Peace."

76561198048565483,Recommended,300260,34377060,Posted: 20 August,all,The Forlorn Wander,"I spent countless hours and followed cortex command since it's early years and loved it.But this game right here brought back all those fond memories I had of CC.In it's current state the game is limited, but still fun to play. The colorful graphics and landscapes are awesome. The controls still need some polish such as the grappling hook, and some vehicles.My favorite part of this so far is the building, trying to brute Force your way upwards is fun and trying to unlock everything is entertaining."
,Recommended,300260,34347534,Posted: 19 August,all,Robocrab,"Oooh yea boi, this is the siquel cortex command deserves, juicy graphics, cool physics and infinite potential! But i have a single complaint, cortex command do not have support for PS4 gamepads by default, but you can add custom gamepad controls, so i can play along with my bro. Planetoid pioneers don't have that option, and i don't want to buy xbox gamepad just because of this little issue. That's all i've got."

,Not Recommended,300260,28018375,"Posted: 28 November, 2016",all,Faxen,"Before saying anything, I loved the developers previous work, but I can't recommend the game in this state. Simply put, there is just too little to do in the game, far far too little. If it was a lower price like 10 or so dollars I would be more willing to tinker with the game and such, but it is about the price of a triple A game (which is not acceptable at all).I refunded the game, unfortunately. I would love to get the game later, but as it is, its not worth it. Lower the price and I will get back to it, but otherwise it is just far too expensive, and there is just far too little in the game."

Easy to use, feature-rich interface, along with a large programming library.I went into it to collaborate and to get myself drawing more. The $40 tag is a bit high, but I figured it keeps the millenially challenged out. hehe"

Otherwise, so far this game is one of my current favorite games to play... Even if it is restricted to some or all macs. Overall 10 out of 5, awesome game.

I love how if you spawn a pioneer with the F6 menu you actually can possess it, instead of having to restart the level. I love the fact that the jetpack is an actual item instead of an inherent thing you have. I love how you can have a supercharger for the jetpack with the Component Capacitor. Basically, I love everything about this game. Except for the freezy bot. He's an annoying abomination."

At another point, I was almost at the end of the tutorial level when my gappling hook smashed my head into a cliffside,  then my eyes rolled into the back of my head.  I watched as my body dangled back and forth.  I tried the starting planetoid again, I set myself on fire and lost.  The rest of my adventures include me being blasted in half and crushed.I reccomend this game because of the endless possabilitys.  I got into the blueprint editor and made a creature from scratch.  Now all I have to do is learn lua script."
