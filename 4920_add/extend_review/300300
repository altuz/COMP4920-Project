,Not Recommended,300300,17093100,"Posted: 17 July, 2015",all,ID,"Rather unsatisfying, simplistic little puzzler.About 2 hours in and having completed (with an ""A"" grade) almost all of the 60 official levels in the game, I've yet to find a single one of them even remotely challenging (and therefore rewarding) to figure out. And yet, I still feel like those levels have taken far longer than they should have to complete, for two reasons;First, because the pace of gameplay is so gratingly slow. The level starts, and within a few seconds it's pretty clear how to solve it - and you are left for several minutes just watching the ball crawl its way back and forth across the level before you can move on. Worse, maybe you overlooked something, and need to make a minor change to the sequence in which you collect the circles - so you must start again, and crawl your way along the same path again... This sense of boredom is only made worse by the extreme simplicity of the graphics, with the result that every level looks so similar as to barely be distinguishable.The second, and probably more significant problem, is the control system. Having been designed entirely around touchscreen support, they are an overly simplistic ""left-click-anywhere-does-everything"" affair, with no alternate or rebinding options. It wouldn't seem like a big deal, as the game mechanics are so limited - and, as far as rotating and activating or deactivating bumpers, if you've got a smoothly functioning mouse there's no real problem. The second control mechanic of drawing lines, however, becomes unnecessarily clumsy with these controls. If, for example, you need to turn a bumper then immediately draw a line, or vice-versa, this imprecision can easily trip you up and force you to restart the level - taking us back to problem #1.Overall - as a lover of puzzle games, I became so bored as to find playing the game a chore after less than 2 hours of gameplay - which in any case, was enough to grind through almost all of the levels. Unless it's 95% off, I'd recommend avoiding this one."

They range from very easy to very challenging, depending on how much experience you have in this game genre.The abilIty to create your own levels to share with the world is, like most games that have this feature, often abused. This makes the search for fun, challenging levels a bit difficult at times. Though most of the time you will be able to find easier puzzles, once you work your way past the all of the empty levels. It's not really much of a problem, just a little annoying.The music can get very repetitive, very quickly. The good news is there is a mute button, so if you don't enjoy it, you can just shut it off.I really enjoyed this game, and would recommend picking it up anytime. It's already cheap, so you don't even have to worry about getting it on sale."

,Not Recommended,300300,29359763,Posted: 19 January,all,Max2030,"I love puzzle games and there are a lot of puzzle games available on steam, from big to small, from serious to casual and many of them are really great and really fun. Unfortunately, Ichi isn't one of them. There are three fundamental traits that make a puzzle game great. One of them is that if you can think it, you should be able to do it. That is, once you figure out the solution, the implementation shouldn't be too hard. There lies the main flaw of this game.The puzzles are pretty straight forward to figure out. In fact they are way too easy. But the problem is implementing the solution. It requires perfect timing and at this point Ichi ceases to be a puzzle game and starts to be a reaction / timing game. That is, you have to rotate an object at the exact right time in order to solve the ""puzzle"". It's not a bad thing per se but I was promised a puzzle game and  I bought this game in hope of solving puzzles. Puzzles are supposed to make you think. And in this regard, Ichi doesn't scratch my itch. Puzzles are too easy to be called puzzles.To sum up, if you like playing reaction/timing games where you have to do things such as press a button at the correct time in order to advance, then you will like this game. But if you actually want to solve puzzles, you have to look elsewhere."
,Recommended,300300,32604562,Posted: 20 June,all,dorkster,"To me, Ichi strikes a good balance with regards to difficulty and length. I usually end up quitting pure puzzle games like this for one of two reasons:1. I come across a puzzle that just feels impossible no matter how long I look at it, resulting in loss of motivation to pick it back up again.2. The sheer number of puzzles is giant. More is not always equal to better, and I find myself getting bored if there's no more new mechanics to be thrown in.Thankfully, Ichi exhibits neither of these. Not once did I feel hopelessly stuck on a puzzle. A few minutes of thinking was always enough to get over any hurdle. Also, the amount of developer-made puzzles is enough to satisfyingly explore the mechanics the game has to offer. There's also a level editor with online sharing, but I think the game is fulfilling enough with the base levels.Speaking of mechanics, the game play is very simple being a mobile game. This is not a bad thing, as this set of mechanics is very tight and even employs a bit of reaction time. One thing I love is when games reveal to you an ability that you had all along. Ichi has one of those (I'm talking about the action that doesn't count as a ""tap""). When the game showed it, I definitely had an ""oooohhhhhh... I see"" moment.It's usually pretty cheap on sale, so I recommend giving it a look if you haven't already."

I really love this game, it's simple yet puzzling at the same time. Your goal is simple, guide a yellow dot to meet all the yellow rings throughout the level. But you don't take control of the dot, you command the objects within the level.I've only discovered six ""commands""/""action objects"" so far, red turning triangles, yellow portals, disappearing & reappearing blue triangles, the black splitter, the block that allows you to bounce off it, and the ability to draw a line. The former 5 are blatantly visible, the 6th is up to you. Once you discover that feature, remember it. It'll help you complete levels.I've cleared four more levels in Ichi than what I previously completed yesterday. Yesterday, I remember thinking, ""HOW CAN YOU BEAT THIS LEVEL? IT'S LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE!"", and today, about an hour after I woke up, I blazed right through them. It really helps you think outside of the box, in some ways. Since it's also a level-by-level game, it's perfect when you want to take a couple minutes break from work.My only complaint is that it says ""taps"", as it comes from mobile platforms. It applies to touchscreen computers, but not the others. But it really isn't that major.Isn't this game on sale now too? For less than one dollar. Honestly, buy it."

The levels are well-designed in such way that they introduce the mechanics very nicely and will teach the player to actually think ahead about how to get to all of the rings.While the well-made level editor provides a way for the community to make their own levels and share it with others, most of the levels are overly-simple - sometimes even completely empty - and add only white noise to the content of the community. Most likely this is due to the achievement you get for 'Uploading your own level', which is obviously redundant, considering the community content 'fallout' it has created.In conclusion, I really enjoy playing Ichi for its charms and interesting use of mechanics. The level-editor adds a lot of creative freedom and replayability to the game, but the developer really has to think of a way to make sure that players cannot just upload an empty level for the purpose of getting an achievement. Other than that, I think that Ichi is definitely worth it's price."

,Recommended,300300,22516727,"Posted: 19 April, 2016",all,CrazyC0330,"Ichi is a solid game build on a simple concept.  It's completely mouse driven, requiring only a number of left-clicks per level.  The first click starts a ball in motion.  This ball will bounce off walls and other objects, such as triangles (which cause right angle direction changes).  Other clicks rotate triangles, or make them disappear or reappear, etc.  Using these principles, your goal is to guide the ball to areas of the 2D level to collect rings.  Early levels have 1 or 2 rings, later levels have more, or are harder to collect.All the shapes that can be interacted with will do so whenever you click, so where you are pointing does not matter.  In fact, the clicking could have very well been implemented as a keyboard press, though I imagine left-clicking was chosen due to sometimes having to click multiple times quickly.The levels the game comes with do not take long to progress though, though you will likely replay them at least once to better your score.  There is a grading system based on the number of clicks it took to complete a level.  For example, clearing a level might require 3 clicks in order to get an A, up to 6 clicks gets you a B, and any more than that and you get a C.  In another level, the number of clicks for the A is different.  Your goal then is to get an A in each level, which doesn't take a whole lot of time, and that's fine.The meat of where I spent my time was creating/sharing my own levels, and then playing those made by others.  This is a cool feature of the game, however, due to the grindy nature of the achievements tied to this feature, (make x levels, play x levels), most people just create crappy levels instead of trying to add to the vibe of the levels that came with the game.  There is a rating system, so that after you play a level, you have the opportunity to give it 1-5 stars and also give it descriptive words such as ""easy"" or ""fast"" or even ""rubbish"".  However, there is no culling of poorly rated levels, nor a way to disclude them from showing up when looking for new user-levels to play.In the end though, despite the shortcomings of the user-made section of the game, the packaged levels are good, the rating system is not too tough, and the game idea is a solid implementation of a simple concept.  The graphics are minimal, but not in a lazy way.  It comes across as more of a stylistic choice rather than lack of artist situation.I've talked two friends into also owning this game, so I definitely recommend it, especially when on sale.  I picked it up literally at 90% off, so I definitely got my 49 cents worth.  Whether full price is worth it, is up to you, but I can tell you I've spent $5 on a lot worse things!"

Ichi badly needs a rewind feature so you don't have to start the whole sequence over if you click at slightly the wrong time. New mechanics are introduced very slowly; I don't need 10 levels to master the ability to rotate triangles. That said, there are thousands of player made levels so if you somehow don't feel like you've exhausted the possibilities during the official levels there's plenty more to be had."

The puzzle involves bouncing a ball and rotating wedges to collect all of the rings using your ball, and it only requires 1 button to rotate all of your wedges.  Very simple and easy to learn, but I can see the puzzles getting really complex in the later stages.  Totally worth your money for the base content alone, and there is still a whole array of user-created levels I haven't even touched."
