,Recommended,300340,16488805,"Posted: 17 June, 2015",all,Fusspott,"Three Pros, Three ConsCons:-The only really big flaw in this game - It's veeerry easy to get lost.  You WILL lose track of where to go next several times.  There's a large open world but no system of objectives and little or no guidance whatsoever.  I got very frustrated even though I had already beaten the demo.-The protagonist (you) act like a jerk sometimes.  There's a phone where you receive a bare minimum of guidance for the first couple of levels, with a simple dialogue system with between one and three choices.  Typically the choices are either ""I need help"" or ""♥♥♥♥ off, I don't need your help"".-The parkour animations aren't very seamless.  Joan (you) can do things that shouldn't be possible and in the process often hauls herself up by empty air or shoves a hand into solid rock.  This happens so, so often.Pros:-It's beautiful.  Skies, landscapes, textures, sounds, all of it.  Soundtrack is amazing - not the sort of thing that I'd listen to a lot myself, but it fits the game very well.  Sometimes it reminds me of Mirror's Edge soundtrack, sometimes Dear Esther.  The enemies go through three stages - unsettling when watching from afar, for which I applaud, then terrifying as they chase you, then boring and frustrating later on when you have five of them chasing you while you  just try to accomplish a task.-Puzzles are satisfying and puzzly.  Some of them are quite simple, but others are Myst-caliber.  The parkour is very fun.  I'm going to compare it to Mirror's Edge because it's a well known game that I've played extensively.  Lemma's parkour is technically inferior, I guess, but it's more fun because of the nonlinear nature of it, especially when you add on Joan's special abilites.  It's also more intuitive, less realistic (even discounting Joan's powers) and glitchier, although IMO not glitchy enough to be really frustrating.-The story and lore... Wow.  The story is compelling and ties into the lore well, which is very fleshed out.  Also, you can look back and see clues to some of the big reveals in the game.  The lore ties Joans' powers quite solidly into a layman's knowledge of quantum mechanics, and the whole alternate universe thing makes sense as long as you accept the basic premise and don't think too hard.Overall, 8/10 would recommend, would play again."

,Recommended,300340,29483283,Posted: 25 January,all,Lintire,"If I wasn't a filthy achievement rentboy, I would not be recommending this game.Lemma is not one game. It is two.One of these games is pretty good. Not bad at all. It's a first-person parkour game  that has a nice sense of momentum and a neat mechanic that can best be described as Shaun White Skateboarding meets Mirror's Edge - terrain generation by wallrunning or sliding off edges.""Just don't touch anything.""- Mark, being prophetic maybe.Now this game is alright. It's based around swiftly running through levels and attempting player made challenges, most of which are worthless templates thrown in for the achievement but occassionally something nice pops up (like my own, go check it out,""The Long Way"") using the game's excellent robust level editor that somehow lacks an undo button.The first game isn't perfect, but it's fun. While the terrain generation is okay and doesn't do much to alter the game, the ancilliary mechanic of using a powerup to generate platforms midair is plain horrible to deal with. The platforms are generated randomly, enjoy your suicide runs.All the enemy types range from annoying to annoying and horrible. This is a game where death just resets you to the nearest ledge, so to punish your immortality, two of the four enemies can cause massive terrain destruction, and easily just lock you into a cycle of despair or cut off paths completely. Not sure why these are even in the game.The art direction is voxel based, apart from the character models, and with smart texture choice this works. The sound library for BGM and ambience kind of sucks, and you're probably better off just putting on your own music, but judging from the credits it was mostly put together from free resources, what can you do.This the first game. This is the game I'm recommending Lemma for. Play this game.The second game absolutely sucks.Once you're out of the tutorial levels, Lemma throws you into the grinder. No real direction, a thoroughly unhelpful guide, you're left to just figure things out. Due to the real lack of asset variety within the bulk of the levels, with no map apart from a vague scribble on paper, Lemma's second game is a game of exploration and slowly understanding the world.This translates to getting lost a bunch and reading some terrible lore that's either technobabble or just entire character arcs in a paragraph.""I still love her.""- I mean the character arc writing isn't bad, just woefully underwritten for the amount of content that's in the game.Don't play this game. Just get around it. Make your own map - you know what,here's mine.It's not fun at all. Look up a guide, watch a playthrough, resign yourself to 5 hours of misery out of a 6 hour initial playthrough, do what you gotta do, because Lemma - for all its focus on mystery - only actually starts getting fun once you figure out what you're doing.Is it worth the investment? Yeah. I enjoyed messing with community levels and spent more time with the level editor than the actual game. I recommend that first game a whole bunch and would consider it a hidden gem. But that mysterious, worthless approach that wastes your time and leads you in circles, that would've ensured that if I wasn't a said rentboy who wastes time on achievements and reviewed this after a first playthrough, it would've been a solid ""don't bother"".Like the platforming, approach Lemma with a running start. It'll reward you for it."

Lemma completely blew me away when I first got it. The game is absolutely gorgeous in my honest opinion.

One of the cons of this game is that somtimes it can get so confusing on where you're supposed to go it's ridiculous.

76561198054023535,Recommended,300340,16150941,"Posted: 3 June, 2015",all,Catpsyche,"This game is almost a perfect game of exploration, parkour, stealth, adventure, strategy, and is practically a God-Game, with lots of hours to explore this virtual open world of Lemma.  This game will have your hands sweating and your stomach queazy IF you have some fear from heights, but never fear for you cannot die in this world.  At times though this doesn't seem to help when you don't know how you are going to get to the next plateau, because dying is a way of thriving in this world.  You build these walls and platforms of energy ice that will aid you to get to further plateaus that are otherwise inaccessable.  You parkour; run, jump, climp, roll, and even build your way, your roads to other levels, other doorways, and other dimensions of Lemma... This game has excellent replay value, because you would never go about doing the same way twice, and you can go and explore at your own pace.  BUT CAUTION - laying too many walls of engery ice may impede you from completing a level or even your ending, as the last level had done for me.  There is no restart level, so you've got one shot to make it right.  Save often at the beginning of each level and do not over-ride those saves until you are sure that you have not screwed up.  [*Please note that I've personally have over 100 hours of gameplay at the end of the game, but am stuck on the last level, because I did just that and it's impossible to undo (destruction) all your previous construction!  And I am going to restart the whole game completely over to get my ending I so deserve.  Because knowing is half the battle!!!]   Other than that, and a bit of confusion of what or where you are in reference to exactly where you are to go next, with so many countless doors and open world, YOU ARE VIRTUALLY AN UNSTOPPABLE FORCE!  Be prepared to be sucked into another dimension on the very precipice to soar to the heavens.  I highly recommend this game, and again the replay value alone could and should give you an indication of just how enjoyable this game can be. ^5"

,Not Recommended,300340,20423034,"Posted: 9 January, 2016",all,Orbi,"I really wish I liked Lemma more. When it clicks, it matches the exhilaration of your parkour game standards. However, some poor and confusing level design saps the fun out of the traversal. Most of Lemma is figuring out what the game is asking you to do or where to go, That's not especially fun.The parkour feels great and natural for the most part, but is maybe a bit lenient? It's a weird thing to complain about, but there were times when the best course of action was to just continually feather the left trigger. Partway through the game, you gain an ability that lets you spawn 'phantom' objects in the environment. This ability felt quite extraneous and is never consistent enough to be used strategically. What you can do is just spam left and right triggers and the ability will push you up in the air constantly to the point where any movement around the levels is trivial. It's the type of addition that's rarely useful in the puzzle solving and almost feels detrimental to the core gameplay.A couple of times over the duration of Lemma, you're chucked into semi-open areas and basically left to your own devices. It's never really clear what general direction you're meant to be heading in. You'd think a parkour game that just let you explore the world would be fantastic but it just feels aimless and frustrating. Given that the game occasionally explicitly points you at where you need to be going with waypoints, it feels haphazard and inconsistent,Graphically, it's perfectly fine. The developers get a lot of mileage out of its 'voxel' aesthetic and I think it works well enough. The sound design and music are solid and help the game's alien atmosphere.I'm quite divided on the inclusion of enemies. I think their abstract design is great but they're not all that fun to manoeuvre around and just recall similar frustrations in other parkour platforming games.I didn't find the story particularly engaging. That said, I didn't find all of the notes so maybe it takes on more meaning with additional contet. When the game asked me to make a moral decision, it never really felt earned or all that important and I kind of just did whatever. Then the game ended and I felt pretty unsatisfied.There's a solid base in Lemma, it just feels so overwhelmingly unpolished and unfocused that I find it hard to recommend at $15. Maybe on sale if you're into parkour?"

,Recommended,300340,24735210,"Posted: 5 August, 2016",all,CSGO is Better,"This is one of the most under-rated games of this time. This is one of those parkour games that you can't not play. The story is really bad but I think this game is really made for the community content which is lacking. I feel like if the editor was much more simpler to use people would be making a lot more maps and the game would become very big, somewhat. Also please don't let people make maps just to get an achievement, that is so childish that they would upload the defaullt empty map just to get an achievement.The only thing I wish that these parkour games would add would be the ""kick off the wall"" move where you basically run towards a wall from the side and kick off of it to climb obstacles while still maintaining speed. Mirrors Edge missed this and so did Lemma, surprisingly Watch Dogs didn't. But the parkour in that game is not that great to begin with but it's the only game where I'm able to use a wall to get a little jump boost. Also Dirty Bomb does it, but it doesn't feel natural."

But it has a lot of problems.First of all, it's very difficult to work out which way you're supposed to go. That might be the point, but at least some concrete indication of general directions would be helpful. Like sign posts. Or a map that actually relates to the level layout. Or possibly a compass, but without objective markers and you only get told ""Head in this direction"" or something.Second, the ""enemies"" are bull honky. Especially the little white things that chase you and explode. I get no satisfaction out of avoiding them. They're just irritating.And what writing there is is like bad sci-fi. Not fun bad sci-fi either, I mean like the Fountain bad.But I still recommend it. It's fun, and that's what matters. The controls are tight, it looks okay, not great, but okay, and it's challenging without being overbearing, even if, again, the challenge is mostly ""okay now where do I go"".Call it a 7/10."

It's basically a combination of Mirror's Edge, Minecraft, and the original PlayStation game Jumping Flash.  It will have you stumped at times, but keep with it and you'll eventually figure it out and get to the end.  The only difference in the 4 possible endings is what the news clipping reads at the end.I'd give the game a 10/10 had the developer not included enemies in certain levels, as I found them to be totally unnecessary as they turned an enjoyable exploration puzzle game into frustration.  Thankfully though there weren't too many levels like that, so overall I give it an 8/10 and worth the purchase price.  The separate challenge levels are also a nice addition for replayability."

In contrast to Mirror's Edge, Lemma is alot more puzzle-based and not a whole lot of running. There's no fighting at all, just parkour and puzzle solving.Lemma's puzzles are not about how to get from point A to point B. The game has a unique gameplay feature where you as the player can create blocks by rolling/sliding off a cliff, or starting a wall-run on a solid wall and then off into nothingness. You use these blocks to complete circuts, connecting two ""wires"" together to for example open a door or blow up a wall.If you're looking for good parkour-only games, then Lemma is for you without a doubt.

Don't go too high, though, you'll become lonely without your cube friends that like to chase you around... then you find out after you kill yourself that they want to kill you.Also, speaking from personal experience, don't say ""Hello"" to the smoky cubes in the Monolith level.

Check out the video here:https://co60.ca/u/1HLemma ReviewIt seems like it’s been ages since we were last gifted with a game featuring a female free-running hero at the helm, with Mirror’s Edge release occurring over five years ago and its sequel currently only existing as a tease. Luckily for us lone developer Evan Todd took it upon himself to craft a parkour adventure of impressive scale and quality to say the least. Enter Lemma, the 5 year development project taken on almost entirely single-handedly that was entirely worth the effort.You awake to little explanation for your strange environment or what brought you there. Gradually a backstory is revealed while you’re busy scaling the floating monoliths that overwhelm your surroundings. Signal towers act as beacons that are used to communicate via SMS with a mysterious character named Mark, someone your character has an apparent history with. He informs you that your name is Joan and that you’ve been trapped in Lemma, a world built in a computer simulation for an unknown experiment. A group of your friends are in the outside world trying to rescue you, but in the meantime it’s up to you and your parkour abilities to attempt to find an escape. Though your companion on the other end of the phone is your only help through the void, it seems you’re not even sure who he really is, what his true intentions are, or even if he’s the one you’re consistently communicating with. Discovering hidden notes in hard to reach locations reveals some of the game’s philosophy on abnormal physical properties and provides a healthy narrative backbone. It all works on a cognitive level and it gels with the gameplay effectively; theories and ideas on the true nature of matter and observation fit well into game of hovering indiscernible matter in endless space. The level of mystery brought about by the way the story is presented to you is intriguing enough to motivate deep exploration, and players who do so are rewarded with a greater understanding for this narrative through the scattered pages.The world of Lemma offers a great feel of segmented openness. Players are free to explore open-ended puzzles and terrain that’s connected by more linear sections. Challenges are presented uniquely and with no explanation, an aspect that promotes discovery and that great sense of enlightenment upon success. While some concepts might be more apparent than others, there’s a problem with it not always being clear what you just did in order to complete a puzzle. The game sometimes becomes a victim of one button performing too many actions and the unintended outcome happening more often than you’d expect. Despite this, the control still feels extremely smooth and natural. At first running may feel a bit janky with arms being thrust with force in front of you, but this feeling quickly vanishes, and it feels as though you’re actually free running amongst the impossible shapes. Eventually players gain the ability to create their own floors and walls to branch out past existing architecture with rolls and wall-runs, adding a fluid extension to the parkour that we’ve never seen before in a first-person platformer. At first this seems like an element that can be easily exploited, but thanks to thoughtful level design there’s never really a situation in which the player can cheat the game. Instead it’s confidently designed around your understanding of how to use it properly. New elements are introduced later on as well; just as you think you’ve seen everything in the way of puzzle mechanics the game brings about new player abilities and environmental pieces. Later in the story you earn a skill to visualise blocks to wall run on out of thin air, giving your free running a new level freedom. Those who master handling the controls will be able to pull of some of the craziest platforming moves imaginable. A decent amount of challenge is given by hostile blocks and textures that hunt you down. These situations can get tense and lead to fun chases and escapes, but unfortunately are watered down by the reality of unlimited retries and object permanence upon respawn.For an independent development and the money asked of the consumer the visual and subtle audio presentation is fantastic. Textures are simple yet have a fine look upon closer inspection, and the intentional overuse of cubic shapes to construct the majority of the world really cooperates well with the gameplay. The use of music is sparse and tastefully added to extraordinary situations. It’s clear that a ton of care went into how you take in each new aspect as you encounter them from your first person perspective, and the inclusion of Oculus support goes even further to demonstrate that. Unfortunately we lacked the equipment to experiment with this addition, but we can only imagine the level of intensity it would add. Climbing obstacles that are only half obstructing your path can sometimes induce some obtuse animations, but otherwise the game is truly an immersive experience.Without a doubt the release of this game is an achievement in indie creative skill and credibility. It’s unquestionably on par with the AAA competition that it took such wise inspiration from. Lemma is a certain type of limbo that we wouldn’t mind getting lost in.SCORE: 8.8"

Control is solid (I think it's better than mirrors edge). Idea is awesome and innovative. Puzzles are interesting. But as a parkour game, I think, there are too many, maybe.

This is quite good but sometimes you may get lost and miss the purpose.

I would not have expected it, but it is here and as good as it should be.It is very easy to draw parallels between Mirror's Edge and Lemma, but they are very different games. Lemma is a giant maze with parkour and puzzles. There is no combat, the physics are less realistic but more fun. The game is extremely impressive for having been made by a single person. While I never got stuck too badly I would come in expecting to get lost a bit.The world is built out of large connecting open areas. You have to figure out where to go and how to get there and that can be quite a challenge in the later areas. I sometimes felt a little directionless, but I followed my gut and felt out where the level was trying to lead me and that has carried me through so far. The game is very hands off on teaching concepts. It expects that you are smart enough to figure things out. This can be seen in both the lack of a map, and very little hand holding in puzzles. This is both bad and good. On one hand it is refreshing to have a game that challenges me to figure things out. On the other hand there are some things I am not sure if I am understand correctly.For example : there are red blocks that chase you by changing block colors to red. I am not sure if there is any way to change the tiles back once they have turned red. If there is a way I have missed it and will continue to play the rest of the game this way. Not a bad thing, just a consequence of not holding my hand.With so many games overcharging for what they are, it is nice to see that the game is priced correctly for what it is. It is fully functioning and polished, but it is not a triple A title. You will get hours of enjoyment out of it, and there seems to be a story to find if your willing to dig deep enough. Much like the rest of the game, the story does not hold your hand.My take? If you liked Fez you may like this. It is more about digging for secrets and finding your way than playing with the core mechanic of the game.Full disclosure I know the maker of this game. I am glad to see the first of hopefully many games coming out of Columbus Ohio.I am glad it turned out well. It took 5 years to make and it would really suck if I had to say it was no good after all that effort."

It's incredibly rewarding to navigate the world, and it creates an excellent sense of flow.  Lemma is definitely worth a look."

,Not Recommended,300340,33432647,Posted: 10 July,all,LonM,"Lemma almost makes the cut for being a good game, but there are some key parts that let the entire thing down.Lemma is a parkour game come walking simulator. The minimal story is told through textual snippets found throughout the game, rleaving much of the rest up to the player to explore. When it works, the running, jumping, and sliding on platforms is good fun.The problems I see are in 3 key areas:- The shift key is used for nearly every action you can take in the game. That makes it nigh on impossible to play when it unlocks the ability to spawn in platforms.- The actual spawning in of platforms is poorly explained at the start, and there don't seem to be any clear rules about what makes a platform spawn and stay spawned or just ghost out of existence.- The ""climbing"" ability is very jerky. Sometimes when you're very far from  grabbable surface, if you press shift the game bumps your chharacter forwards in a very unclean fashion, and pushed you up to the surface, often clipping through the world while doing so.When the game is just about running, and sliding in simple terrain it works very well, but as the levels get more complex it becomes nightmarish to try and manage."

The music and scenery are minimal but beautiful, and the story is solid, for a game that one wouldnt expect to have much of one.The first portion of the game is fairly linear and simple, as you learn the mechanics and are allowed to test and play with them. Around the midpoint of the game, however, it opens up hugely, and exploration becomes a big component of the gameplay. This slower more open portion of the game also really allows the player to explore the limitations of the mechanics and have a great time wallrunning all up and down these expansive environments. On that note, the game is also much longer than i expected, which is welcome, because, again, it allows for a lot more exploration and experimentation.That said, the game is not without its bugs. Collision detection is at times buggy, i was able to get out of bounds in a few places, and the ability to spawn new platforms was confusing, poorly explained and inconsistently responsive.All in all, Lemma has a few hiccups, but when you get into the flow of it, its very satisfying and fun."

,Recommended,300340,18023455,"Posted: 13 September, 2015",all,alison,"This is a pretty fun parkour game, the first one i've played since Mirror's Edge that actually ""feels right"". Not that there are many parkour games out there. But, you can see your body, there's no reticle or HUD and it's first-person! You can jump, wall-run, climb up edges, the works. It is unusually mysterious in that you don't get much direction and basically have to find your own way out of a maze. Unfortunately, that is also it's downfall.At the start the levels are set up in such a way that you can sort of intuit where to go, but the last few levels of the game are increasingly open world, which make it very difficult to figure out where you are supposed to go. This is compounded by the fact that you also get the magical power to create walls out of thin air, so you can end up wall-running all over the place without knowing whether the wall you just spent 15 minutes building is on the way to the exit or if you are going to keep running until you glitch out off the edge of the level.TLDR, really awesome parkour mechanics, but i wish the developer had been a little less artistic and given us a minimap or even just an occasional objective marker so i could actually finish the game. The magical wall-creation is where it starts to jump the shark. Still, the first 4-5 hours are a lot of fun if you are having Mirror's Edge withdrawals."

I've played many of them including A story About My Uncle, Dying Light, and of course Mirror's Edge, which is always the go-to example for the genre.Lemma is a game that takes place in a surreal, almost dream-like world built out of cubes. You play as Joan, a woman who has mysteriously found herself stuck in this strange alternate dimension as a result of her friend Mark's experiments. Communicating with Mark over texts, Joan must find a way to escape.Above all else, Lemma is simply a joy to play. Everything, from the movement of the camera, to the sound design and fluidity of the ontrol ""feels"" completely and utterly natural.And this is even before you get to Lemma's main innovation - creating your own paths through the levels.By sliding off a ledge or running off a wall, new blocks appear under Joan's feet. Later on, you also gain the ability to spawn blocks in mid-air, though this is limited in some respects, as there are out-of-bounds areas where you cannot create new blocks. These blocks aren't just for show, as you'll also use them to solve various puzzles throughout the levels. Generally, these will involve routing power through conduits and stepping on switches. The game never holds your hand when it comes to figuring these out, but you eventually do notice patterns.There are enemies in the environments. These include exploding golden cubes, flying black cubes that sound like bats, and lasers that take big chunks out of the environment. Avoiding these enemies is sometimes frustrating, especially since they follow you around very closely and give you very little chance to shake them.At first, the levels are very linear, point A-B affairs. About halfway through, however, the game becomes much more open, with ""levels"" consisting of multiple areas that you'll need to traverse and backtrack through. There will occasionally be some guidance, but for the most part, you're on your own in terms of figuring these out. The final level is a crazy gauntlet consisting of at least 7 multiple diverse environments that you must navigate back and forth. I do wish that there was some sort of map or even just a little more guidance, during these later parts of the game, but I still enjoyed them overall.Lemma's atmosphere is incredible. The environments have a surreal, psychadelic look and feel. There are times when it's hard not to stop and take a look at where you've been and where you need to go. The use of normal mapped textures on the voxels is very appealing. Things get even more impressive during certain sections of the game, when everything is ""collapsing"". You'll see pieces of the environment get popped in and pushed out, cube by cube, which is an effect that never gets old. The music is sparse, but when it comes in, it's absolutely beautiful, yet eerie at the same time.The story is Lemma's weakest aspect. There's almost no voice acting to speak of apart from the grunting and breathing of Joan, so you have to read everything. You end up finding notes scattered around the environment, and the game expects you to piece them all together. Unfortunatley, the narrative is all over-the-place, with different threads expanded upon in different areas of the game. There are four difffferent endings, but I was a bit confused as to what exactly I accomplished as the credits rolled.In addition to the main campaign, Lemma also supports custom challenge levels, leading to great replayability.Lemma is proably the most underrated and overlooked game of 2015. There was basically no internet buzz on this one, which is a shame. I hadn't even heard about this game until just before the end of the year. While there is a low-budget feel to the game, and the story falls flat, there's an obvious amount of love poured into every other aspect of Lemma that makes all of this forgivable. It's an experience that I would recommend to everyone. Personally, I actually feel that Lemma surpasses its inspirations, and sets a new standard for first-person platformer games. I just hope other teams making these types of games can keep up with what this one-man effort has achieved."

The graphics are subpar. The enemies are frustrating and poorly designed. The story is confusing, it's ""moral dilemma"" feels tacked-on. The levels are even more confusing than the story, and many just feel like the designer just went ham with the sphere brush in the level editor. Speaking of the level editor, it's terrible. None of the keybinds make sense. But the thing that really sealed the deal for me was the fact thatTHERE IS NO UNDO BUTTON.and because of the way the editor is laid out, it's entirely possible to delete a massive, complex portion of the level with a single, stray keystroke. There is literally no way to get it back, unless you're hitting save before every single keystroke.I think that this is a greatconceptfor a gamemechanic, but the game surrounding that mechanic is bad.

All the fun free running / climing action of mirrors edge, with no wonky action combat mechanics bringing the fun to a crawl.Fun enough game until it starts throwing unweildly mechanics at you after about two hours or so. The etherial platform summoning ability that you have to use is both unreliable and just not fun. It does nothing but detract from what would be amazing gameplay.The ability to create walls by wall running and platforms by sliding / rolling seemed broken enough by how trivial it made traversing the game, although I did enjoy the mechanic of using those created platforms and walls to conduct the energy streams. This mechanic wasn't utilized enough personally. It's used in earnest for about four levels then is relegated to just filling small holes to continue the energies progress. Why even bother?The story is fun, if you bother to collect all the notes (which I did), but is not unreasonable to think that it is missable entirely.On a positive note, almost all the enemies in the game are terrifying. This is due mostly to sound design, which is great. I had a general fear of dread around the enemies that I was aware of, and jumped out of my skin around the enemies that I was unaware of when they made their presence known."
