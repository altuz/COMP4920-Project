I've been dealing with a lot of ""big"" companies' customer support, and getting terrible customer support (including having my requests shut down with no communication - thanks, Sony). So when I emailed the developers of Road Redemption regarding issues around a 32 bit win7 4GB machine, not only was I highly surprised to see a responce within 4 hours (give or take 20 minues) but having an actually answer (in this case, I was informed that the issue had been noticed and the game would be patched in a few hours).  In one contact, the developers not only smashed my expections, I now use them as an example of a company doing it right. So, developers, please please please, keep up the great work."

(Game handles pretty well, keeping that balance between realism and fun.)Action Packed (Game keeps players on their toes, with funny wipeouts in the mix of things.)Lots of Weapons (Tons of things to fight with, including guns, which Road Rash never had.)Upgrades and Perks (They work wonderfully and really help the player through the race.)Different Environments (They change as your progress.)A Secret Map (Are you guys kidding me... FreakingRainbow Road from Mario Kart?!?!YES!)Things I feel need some work:Optimization (The maps can become very very laggy with frames dropping to around 5 FPS, I have a pretty beefy rig with a Radeon 7970 and it shouldn't have problems with a game like this.)Voice Overs ( I really wish there was some kind of voices for the police and riders, not really dialoge, more like ""Oofs"" or laughter and maybe a ""Pull over!"" from some cops now and then.)Character Customization (There really isn't any, but this is early access and I have a feeling this could change easily.)Overall this game is really fun and takes me back to the good 'ol PSX days sitting around my house, playing Co-op smacking my father with a chain in Road Rash Jailbreak."

There was this gem of a title called Road Rash that was just about the coolest thing anyone had seen at the time.Road Redemption takes the spirit of that old classic, slaps some more meat on the bones, and brings it into the modern gaming scene, with it's own original twists.Road Redemption is a straight arcade game. Don't go looking for a ""racing"" game here so much. The emphasis is much less about getting to the finish line first, and more about making sure nobody else does.And that's where it shines. Road Redemption doesn't try to be anything it's not. It knows it's a fun, quirky arcade racing rampage. That's all it wants to be.The graphics are not amazing, but not bad. The sound is a bit rought, but the music is good.Currently the game is not without it's faults, there's some performance issues, sound effects could REALLY use their own volume slider (they can get insanely loud at times), the camera control while shooting is a bit hard to use, and the menus and such are pretty minimalist.At it's core though, the game is just crazy fun. You'll find yourself playing it over and over, even after telling yourself ""Just one more time..."".The plans they have for adding multiplayer and stuff in the future only add even more to look forward.I do love seeing the collaborations with other indie devs too. (Shovel Knight starting with a shovel FTW!)All in all, for a fun, crazy good time that mimics the joy of old school fun times, Road Redemption is totally worth the asking price."
76561197970396137,Not Recommended,300380,12727910,"Posted: 1 November, 2014",all,Martleby,"The following is based on 5 hours play of the Early Access version, which I hope will provide some useful non-partisan feedback to the developers.1) This is not a racing gameRacing games tend to have some things in common. They have tracks, they have timers, they have scores, they have course records, they have winners and losers, they challenge the player to improve, and they instil a sense of progression and achievement. Road Redemption has and does none of these things.Road Redemption neither rewards success nor frowns upon failure. You simply must not die, or else you’re back to square one. Take a “race” event, for example. To win any money you must finish in the top three. However the sorts of thing you can spend your money on post-race are health top-ups, nitro-replacements and other items that ameliorate the damage of the previous race. Given that the aim is simply not to die, it behoves the player not to actually take part in the race. I, for example, employ a half-throttle strategy, simply puttering around at half-throttle avoiding obstacles, combat and various other hazards in order to get to the end with as little damage as possible. More often than not this strategy leads to a top three finish, but it doesn’t matter anyway because you can still progress to the next event regardless of where you finish. I’ll say it again: there is no benefit to taking part in the race because the aim is not to die.What of the other events, such as Take Down, Jump Jets, and Police Attention? The same applies. Your priority is not to die and “failure” doesn’t hinder your progress. So should you a) participate and risk death for no benefit or, b) pull off to the side of the track and do something else for three minutes? If you answered “b” you’re beginning to see the problem with Road Redemption.2) The tracks need a designerRoad Redemption’s ‘road’ courses are dull and boring. They largely consist of four and six lane highways, long, sweeping, shallow corners and some of the dullest designs I’ve ever seen. If you were hoping to experience the thrill of opening the throttle into a blind corner on to oncoming traffic, darting between cars and trucks as your heart starts beating that bit quicker, Road Redemption will leave you disappointed.The roof-top courses are simply dreadful and need to go. If I want to race in a city I want to do it at ground level. I want to blast down alleys, race through shopping malls, crash into curiously placed fruit stalls. What I don’t want is to race on roofs crashing into air-conditioning units. Nor do I want to fall off the side of a building and for the game to reposition me somewhere in mid-air leading to an inescapable death cycle, which seems to happen rather more often than it ought.Don’t get me started on Rainbow Road. This is out of place and even the game doesn’t seem to understand it. I’ve “fallen” off this track to have the game reposition me after the finish line - the bike indicator jumped from the progress meter to the right hand side of the screen and I could not finish the race. I’d also say this: if you want to do something a bit self-referential or add a knowing wink to a game, pick something from your own history like a 16-bit Road Rash level. Don’t pluck something out of a completely different series like Mario Kart.3) Procedures are for bureaucratsHad I been careful enough to read that Road Redemption uses a lot of “procedural generation” beforehand I almost certainly would not have bought it. Why?a) Because infinitely generated dullness is infinitely dull and,b) Because developers never give you the option to replay the same procedurally generated level.There’s nothing wrong with adding a bit of randomness to a game - games like the Burnout series have been doing this successfully for years - but when everything is random and there’s no mechanism to replay a “procedurally” generated course then there is no sense of progression or achievement.Imagine that you’d actually bothered engaging with the game (which you won’t, see 1 above) and you’d come first in a race. Imagine further that you’d had so much fun, you thought you’d like to play the exact same level again. What if you then wanted to share that level with friends for a bit of friendly competition? What if you’d like to have a play with the parameters sent into the procedures to see what sort of madness you could generate - or better yet have the control to create and share your own courses? Well tough. You can’t.This strikes me as a massive oversight and one that should be easily fixable, but strangely never seems to occur to developers.4) It’s not about the bikesCall me a traditionalist but I expect a bike game to have a good range of bikes, all with unique handling and performance characteristics. I want a bike shop so I can ogle over the Diablo 1000, I want an upgrade shop so I can fit nuclear-powered rocket-motors to my bike. I want to indulge my virtual-bike fantasies.Road Redemption doesn’t give you any of this. Instead you get a skill tree (of which more later) and jump jets.5) Moral hazard?You might think that bike-based combat would be an almost infinite source of fun, but in truth it gets old very quickly. I played through the original Road Rash recently and found the combat there to be far superior even though it was far more limited. Why?It’s all to do with focus. Road Rash is a racing game where limited violence can be deployed to your advantage (and often chagrin when it goes wrong). Road Redemption is a non-racing game where egregious violence is used all the time for no specific purpose other than you can. Road Rash also introduced consequences for being violent (albeit in a limited way - Natasha being rude to you wasn’t the end of the world), whereas Road Redemption’s violence is entirely consequence free.You can have all the guns, clubs, bombs and swords you want but if they only exist for the sake of existing what’s the point?PS Swinging from helicopters sounds like it should be fun, but isn’t.6) Do you wanna be in my gang?Another thing the original Road Rash got right was its personality and connection to the game world. There are other characters who converse (yes, in a limited way) with you and draw you into the  world of illegal street racing.Road Redemption, on the other hand, is completely impersonal. You are apparently a member of some bike gang (of which the only evidence is the occasional appearance of a rider with a green arrow pointing to him), battling other gangs (who are they, why are we fighting?) in some strange dystopian world of which you - the player - have little knowledge of and probably care even less about.7) Skill me up, Scotty!If there is a golden rule to racing games it’s that the player’s skill comes first and foremost. If the player enters a corner too fast and ends up embedded in a wall that is his or her problem; conversely if a player executes the perfect jump, squeezes between two oncoming vehicles and wins by the narrowest of narrow margins that is the player’s reward. It’s fine to add some variability - such as tires bursting, engines blowing etc. etc. - but it should, essentially, be all about the player.Road Redemption’s skill system flies in the face of this. The player’s actual skill is replaced by a tree of variables (or “skills”) that affect the outcome, turning the game into a grind rather than focusing on improving and rewarding the player’s real skill (or would do if the player engaged with the game: see 1, above).8) Control, oh pitiful controlI found the game almost impossible with mouse and keyboard. Imagine piloting a brick at 100mph. That’s Road Redemption with a mouse and keyboard. A controller is infinitely better - as long as you don’t try using any of the ranged weapons."

I was hesitant for part with $25 Australian for a game that might have disappointed me, being a Road Rash fanboy who occasionally still plays the originals of that series.I couldn't be happier with Road Redemption and I congratulate the developer, not only on how well the've paid homage to the old school Road Rash series, but how they've even improved on the formula by adding so many weapons, guns, different vehicles and the open-ended promise of more content. I noticed a multiplayer update has recently been added which i'm excited to play. It would be cool if some more basic racing modes with just melee weapons and longer, scenic tracks were added - and some livestock and pedestrians to brutally tear apart under my motorcycle - or whip around the teeth with a chain and then drag them behind my bike.This is exactly the kind of game which is making people like me switch back to PC.Well done and thank you from the bottom of my heart."

Well, it's almost 2017. It sucks hard, and there's nothing ""Road Rash"" about it. Music, style, it just lacks everything that made Road Rash good.There's been many updates since then, but it really added nothing, and the entire game feels like a mobile game. Just lifeless in everything, the stages, the bikes (and bikers), even the menu theme is just some soft piano crap which doesn't fit the game at all. It's also missing the punk biker gang feel that the original had, which to me was pretty important in making Road Rash, well, Road Rash.The bikes feel like they are on rails, and not the uncontrollable screaming banshee like they were in the original Road Rash that made you fight for your life. Hitting other bikers feel really unsatisfying as well.Don't get me wrong, it doesn't need to be a complete copy of Road Rash. I can accept that just fine, but this game is utterly lifeless. It lackssoul.It just so happens to be a game where you can only ride bikes and can hit other bikers. The similarities literally end there. Look at every other review here, it's always ""not quite Road Rashjust yet"", or ""it's getting there, just abit more!"". Yeah, that's what I thought as well, and look at it now.If you want a game that didn't forget its own roots, get Carmageddon Max Damage. It's quite faithful to the original (they at leasttriedif you don't agree with me). At least that game got out of early access, and even if you don't like it, it's the better game by far.Review update #1:Apparently there's no longer any piano crap playing in the menus, just heavy metal.

,Recommended,300380,14552416,"Posted: 19 February, 2015",all,BenjiBoyAU,"As a kid growing up I spent so many hours playing Road Rash on the Mega Drive. After hearing of this nostalgic remake I had to check it out.What I like about the game:+ Fast paced. No boring bits here folks.+ Action can get intense, especially when you are paying attention to the road hazards as well.+ Tons of weapons to weild.+ Riding physics are pleasant with a nice ""arcade"" feel.+ Plenty of ways of dispatching your foes into the asphalt, speeding cars, poles, concrete etc.+ Runs smooth on older hardware (circa 2005) and is rock stable.What I don't like:- Rooftop & Space levels are disjointed from the fast flow of the other levels.- Rooftop levels have minor bugs that cause your cycle to crash.- Seems to be an unnecessary mid-air slow down effect off ramps and jumps.- Some textures are low-res and are reminiscent of late '90's Direct3D games.- A few of the music tracks are out of place.What I'd like to see:= The textures pumped up to decent resolutions.= Music tracks that fit the grunge / metal theme of this game.= Speedometer.= Crashed bikes become obstacles. Just to create some jeopardy for firearms lovers.= More bikes + riders to select.= Upgradeable bike parts from tyres to turbos to keep the game interesting.= Less ""catch up"" handicap.These are small negatives on a massively fun game. I might sound a little harsh on a game that isn't finished, however I feel that the game and it's current content just need a minor nudge in the right direction before it gets polished so that it will be the killer game experience it deserves."
,Recommended,300380,23420798,"Posted: 6 June, 2016",all,Snacky Chan,"Road Redemption was a game that, when it came out, quickly became one of my favourites. The gameplay was exceptionally fun, mixing combat and racing decently well. The mechanics felt a bit clunky, but it was still playable. It was the only game on the market that allowed you to fly around with a jetpack on your bike while propelling yourself forward with a grappling hook, so I could live with a few glitches.I've only recently returned to this game, and I'm still having fun with the game. However, and there are a few things that have changed I'm curious about:Why is there limited jetpack fuel?Realistically, it makes sense that you only have a set-amount of jetpack usage. However, in a game where you can swing a battleaxe on a motorcycle, drive on Rainbow Road, and certain stages are labelled, ""Hallucinogenic Chemical Zone"" where cars fall from the sky, I wouldn't think realism was in DarkSea Games' list of things they wanted this game to be.Why don't I have infinite grappling hooks?Exact same point as above.I mean, my favourite part about old Road Redemption was that once you got the jetpack and grappling hook, the game became a psuedo flight-sim game, where you had to propel yourself back onto the road with the hooks. If you got the hang of it, you became a god among men.Still, despite my complaint, I can still recommend the game. It's still highly enjoyable, and if Road Redemption's Wikipedia page can be trusted, we'll see a full-length game release in September of this year."

76561198058707095,Not Recommended,300380,14442376,"Posted: 12 February, 2015",all,Janos Xyn,"This game was hugely disappointing. Why is it so difficult for developers to replicate Road Rash? Every reboot, remake, reimagining, homage, always focuses on the fighting. Fighting in Road Rash was a novelty but not what made the game special. It was the racing. The twisting turns, the trecherous roadways; it was the rush when you threaded the needle at top speed on the 15th mile of Pacific highway. The key to success was racing clean or a kick to your opponent at an opportune time, because getting into a slugfest slowed you down and cost you the race. It was as much you against the level as it was you against your opponents. There was a vibe, an edge, and one hell of a soundtrack.Road Redemption has none of these things. It is bland and devoid of character. It focuses too much on weapons and damaging your opponents and not enough on racing or level design. The core gameplay mechanic, how you navigate through the game, is also flawed. Rather than a hub where you can select races or make a name for yourself on some underground circuit, you are forced to progress through a series of ""levels"". Each level has an objective, win the race, take out x number of oppontents, use this special move, etc. The kicker: when you die, you start back at the beginning. Not a unique concept, starting at the beginning when you die, but an odd one for a racing game. And for a game with such drab gameplay, repeating the opening levels numerous times is more punishment than consequence.All in all, if you're looking for a Road Rash equivalent, keep looking. This game offers no redemption."

The combat is fairly satisfying, hectic, and has some great visual feedback. It's fun at first, but then you start to encounter some problems.For one thing, the physics are REALLY rough. I understand that this was (is-being, rather, as it is still in Early Access) made using Unity, and this is an ambitious project for the engine. Bouncing around canyons and buildings like a racketball while screaming at a hundred miles an hour is humorous at first, but I found myself quickly frustrated as I would tap a rock on the side of the road on accident and then be propelled into the sky a hundred feet up. Or better yet, scream down a road as fast as possible and run into a slightly-protruding drain pipe and suddenly come to a dead stop.For another thing, the skyscraper levels are interesting, but dumb. You get a grapple gun and jet boosters. The grapple gun is difficult to use, especially as there is no tutorial for it. The jet boosters are fun, but given the tight turns and deceptive nature of the tracks, you will likely plummet to your doom. Again. And again. And...again.Also, there are only a handful of different tracks, none of which are particularly inspired. Even the rainbow road one is little more than frustrating. The first few missions have you repeating the same track with different start points or a different time of day, but it can get tiresome once the gameplay begins to wear thin.And finally, the game is rather unstable. It's crashed on me three times so far and I've only played about 80 minutes of it.I understand that this is early access, but it is still very rough around the edges. I like the combat a lot, I like the light RPG advancement elements, I like the variety of weapons. This game shows a lot of potential, but has a long road ahead of it before I can give it a thumbs up. Once they iron out these issues, it will definitely be worth getting, but until then, ride on friend."

Graphics look nice, although a bit uninspired.Cons: Opponents are too good. They drive perfectly and never hit anything or run off the road like I do constantly, they do melee combat perfectly, they shoot handguns perfectly. This is not great for the players confidence.There is no story whatsoever.No avatar modification or creation.No upgrading the bikes.No countdown before the race starts.Music is not great. Not horrible but pretty damn boring if you compare it to Road Roash, which we do of course.Stages in the campaign mode are randomized.

If you have a modern computer you will enjoy it.BUT OLDER COMPUTERS BE WARNED: It is semi-playable as of the September 27th, 2014 update. The miniumn requirements are a lower than they should be. You will have problems running it if not at the recommended settings.I own a Laptop with a dual core 2.1 ghz processor from 2009. It gets the job done when I want to play some older games (I can even run skyrim on low settings decently).  If you turn down the settings down to 'fastest' setting and change the resolution to the lowest you can get acceptable framerates that allow you to play the game without too much of problem. You still might suffer from random studdering and low framerate. At least now you can acutally able to control your character and even knock some other npcs off their bike. The first level for some reason is very resource intensive (maybe too many cars and objects loaded) but the later levels run pretty well. At this time I can play it but I still get frustrated when the controls don't respond as quickly as would like (but it is definitly better than it was before!). Still get a few random pauses in the game, and the framerate will drop when something happens.I think what I'm more impressed is how much the developer has optimized this game, even for older computers. At this rate it wouldn't suprise me if it could run on a ti-89 calculater with all thes updates. If your computer has better specs than my potato-top then you got yourself an awesome game."

Road Redemption is closer to Mad Max on motorbikes, and they just happen to be ""racing"".It isn't a true racer. The rubberbanding is blatantly obvious. You catch up to people easily and they go from being much slower than you to keeping pace with you almost instantly, staying by your side. The game just wants you to hit people, the race is secondary. Some of the levels are annoying, namely the rooftop ones, and aiming guns with a controller is a challenge. And it is now apparently a rogue-like, which is a thumbs down for me.Having said that, it is good, clean fun. It's well made. It's thematic. There are a variety of weapons, most of which are satisfying to use. There are a variety of missions to complete while racing - some are fun, some aren't, but thats probably just my personal taste.As long as you get into it knowing what to expect, I can recommend it."

,Recommended,300380,20065259,"Posted: 29 December, 2015",all,FatBatMan,"For those of you who haven't played Road Rash:Road Rash was a game in the early 90s where you grabbed your Ratbike (because it leaves droppings everywhere...geddit?) and took to the open road, merciless punching, kicking, whipping, blunt-objecting, mother-insulting and racing anyone foolish enough to try and ride alongside you.Along the way, you earned cash, upgraded your bike and progressed through the game. It's a simple premise.It was, basically, the video game that your mother referenced everytime she had book club and the ladies started ranting about senseless violence. Hence, of course, it was arguably one of the best games of all time.Road Redemption is Road Rash re-done, with a couple of extras thrown in - there's a better upgrade system in terms of EXP which makes the game feel a little rogue-like - not a negative point at all, since it allows you to have a couple of races, crash and die, upgrade your stuff if you can, and not worry about being stuck on some difficult level without progressing.During breaks in levels you can use your cash to buy upgrades at the store - these upgrades only last as long as you do: once you die you lose these (but keep your EXP upgrades).There are also a lot more weapons, which is fantastic, and riders and bikes with stats that affect gameplay.If you have played Road Rash:It's Road Rash basically.What I would like to see:Voice-overs. In the style of Quake and Unreal Tournament, annoucing when I'm on a rampage or something.Additional bikes and weapons are a maybe, as well as a larger skill tree. New maps and locations would be fantastic as well!All in all though, this game is quite complete, and definitely a recommended buy!"

,Recommended,300380,17182528,"Posted: 22 July, 2015",all,Apsalar,"A Good Feeling, Often ForgottenBefore I get into specifics about the game I want to highlight something very important about it, something that in contemporary games is often so drowned in an abyss of complexity and glamour that we forget to even reflect on it: Road Redemption is FUN.  Every single time, without fail, laugh-out-loud duck-and-flinch old school video game FUN.  I spend most of my game time in that aforementioned abyss, straining my intellect and grasping for immersion. Road Redemption has taken its place in my apothecary as a balm, a revitalizer for my spirit, after such sessions.This game flashed by on my front page for weeks before I really looked into it; I didn't look too closely because I figured it was some sort of glorified street-moto Trials clone.  What opened my eyes to it was a search by tag ""Permadeath.""  I'm a big fan of permadeath mechanics in general so I became ravenously curious and dove into a game forum spiral,Risk of Road RedemptionTurns out, at its core, Road Redemption is a fiercely indie, happily absurd, fresh, new, and ridiculously satisfying roguelite.  Let me clarify by discussing the major gameplay elements.The loose premise is that you are a gang biker trekking across USA, west coast to east coast, for some reason that somehow involves a boss level at the end.  RR does not for a moment pretend to have a rich and nuanced plot.  The trek is divided into more than a dozen stages that take between five or ten minutes each to complete. Gameplay is traditional 3rd-person motorcycle race style with the control schemes to match (this will show my age, but it reminds me fondly of playing Road Rage in the arcade back in the day).So how is it roguelite?First off, each playthrough is entirely procedurally generated- the road maps, terrain, and absurdity variables (sometimes you'll get a level with ""hallucinogenic chemical zones"" that are filled with bright colors and cars falling out of the sky, other times the whole course is made of skyscraper rooftops, etc, etc); the enemies, their names, attributes, and gang affiliations; the weapon and item drops; and the game type for the level (for example, one level may involve getting the police to really notice you, another will be about smashing a rival gang, another will be a simple race).Second, Road Redemption uses the modern meta roguelite paradigm that more or less rules the genre at the moment.  You permadie again and again and again but you can earn xp during your playthrough that can then be spent on permanent meta-perks like more health per level or higher base melee damage.  It's more challenging than some of the examples out there, because if you don't earn enough xp to buy a perk, all that xp dissappears.  Nonetheless, bit by bit, I find myself (sometimes) stringing together more and more levels before the inevitable fatality (other times, I just die- but man is it a fun ride).""What I take from writers I like is their economy...that's magical."" -Mos DefRR shows great economy of design. It's indie in the beautiful way only our age allows and it does not strut like it's AAA. There is no chaff, no filler. It doesn't pretend to be something great or profound. In fact, if anything, it is proudly and defiantly banal.  And therein lies the magic, that special something that makes a game fun with no pressure and no strings. Just FUN.And in our lives of overwork, overextension, and exhaustion= I have to say I really appreciate that.RR is in Early Access so I will hold off on a number rating, but I will say with great joy- If you just want something FUN to play, get this game. You will not be disappointed.No Drama, Just Reviews***Also, SHOVEL KNIGHT***"

When it came out, they ♥♥♥♥♥ed and moaned (and some still do) about low frame rates. They ♥♥♥♥♥ed and moaned about the sound track, the gameplay, basically everything.Road redemption is a great example of an early access game that actually gets worked on over time, as it should be. Early access is a scourge on games. Especially because people seem to think two things. The first thing being that buying early access gives them a seat at the development table (it doesn't) and the second thing is that for some baffling reason, most people assume the early access means finished product. Road Redemption has come a long way since it's inception, going from a somewhat shoddy bike racing game with combat, to what a modern iteration of road rash should be.  The frame rate is smooth, much smoother than it was when I first got it. The controls are responsive and easy to learn, also an improvement from it's early days. The enemy bikers are ridiculous and fun. I encountered some guy wearing huge bullhorns on his head, I promptly shot him in the back but apparently he was a boss with a longer life bar than most so I had to beat him to death with a shovel. A sort of flaw that isn't really a flaw is the games rubber band AI. If Road Redemption were a regular racing game, it would be a flaw. Road Redeption is a combat game though, and so this habit of enemies to soft lock onto your position only serves to make fighting them easier. That's not to say you can't take a cheap shot as you sail by some chump with one of the games many weapons. Both guns and melee weapons to choose from. These weapons can be earned by killing enemies, or stolen from enemies by interupting one of their attacks with counter while unarmed. Some of the weapons are very difficult to get without stealing them from enemies. The sound track is great, perfectly complimenting the gameplay and the graphics are appealing.It's a deal at 20$."

Well this is the spiritual sequel we've been waiting for. Even in early access, Road Redemption is pretty solid. Motorcycle racing and combat together again, but this isn't just a re tread on an old game; Road Redemption brings the basic idea to the 21st century with multiple weapons and different objectives keeping things fresh. The control feels pretty good and I personally have not run into any bugs as of yet. Be aware the game is in early access and is unfinished. I'm eager to see what's new in future updates.

I came back a few times to check on any fixes and updates knowing that I got it in Early Access. After not playing for months I booted it up today and was blown away! The developers have been working hard. The UI and Menus are completlely redone and look great. The grahics have been updated tremendously. And while the gameplay had a solid foundation to begin with, everything feels tighter. Hopefully the multiplayer code will be added soon and maybe a savegame option so that campaign progress isn't lost.

,Recommended,300380,12191027,"Posted: 22 September, 2014",all,shoggofu,"I’ve played road Redemption for a bit under two hours time.- It’s really fun, motor bikes are awesome.- It has almost rogue like elements such as pseudo-permadeath and randomisation in levels and hazardshttp://youtu.be/m9mgSS0MWPkhttp://youtu.be/Bgd7GNu_YzsThe graphics look alright. It feels very much like an arcade game to me. It’s not gritty, it’s fast paced and you can easily maneuver your motorcycle midair. The game is definitely not a simulator and it doesn’t let sense stop you from being able to do some outrageous things.-----Not that really it affects gameplay but the aesthetics could use some polish. This is to be expected from an early access title, especially on it’s initial release.----- If you miss a jump you will fall into a mysterious grey void which is the point where structures cease to exist. And here you will find random props suspended in the air and other motorcyclists who suffered the same fate.-----I like the v-twin sound of the your avatars bike. But I think riding a sportsbike that sounds like a racer would be cool too.-----In some areas I suffered from low framerate with the graphical settings set to ‘fantastic’. Lowering the settings to ‘good’ alleviated this. 11 But framerate was still an issue where large amounts of vehicles were present in close proximity.At the moment there is only the option of campaign mode, either single player or splitscreen coop. There is no online mode yet. I played solo.-----In campaign mode you play through a series of levels. Most levels take place on a highway populated by road vehicles.-----It is cool to ride your motorcycle at high speed through traffic while brawling with other motorcyclists. Trucks overturn and spill their cargo, blocking the road and you constantly have to avoid cars that have gone out of control. You will miss some obstacles by only centimetres.-----Some levels take place on roof tops. You and the other motorcyclists must all make jumps from rooftop to rooftop. For some reason automobile traffic will also occasionally join you on the rooftops. They aren’t very good at making jumps.-----Every stage has a different objective which appears to be randomly selected, such as racing other motorcyclists, attracting police attention or taking out a number of other motorcyclists without using weapons.-----Occasionally there are special hazards present. Theses include a motorcyclist who constantly throws timed explosives onto the road behind them and ‘car rain’. You might want to keep your distance just so that you can survive and make it to the next stage.-----All other motorcyclists and certain cars are hostile. They will swing weapons at you or try to drive you off the road. You will lose health when you take hits, fall off your bike or fall off a building. When you run out of health it’s game over.-----You have the choice of up to three weapons at a time. You can acquire different weapons by dispatching foes or completing stages. Most of them are melee weapons.-----Initially I used the gamepad because I figured that it’s probably better than keyboard and mouse for controlling a motorbike. It is probably is better for controlling your throttle. But then I realized that this game has guns and the game pad sucks for using firearms.-----I would recommend using the mouse and keyboard solely for this purpose. Being able to use your guns effectively and your ammunition efficiently means a lot in this game.-----Weapons aside, the coolest way to dispatch other motorcyclists is probably by grabbing them. You can take them by the neck and maneuver them into oncoming vehicles or obstacles.-----There is also a grenade launcher which you can fire from your motorcycle just like terminator II. I was very happy to see this.-----You have a limited nitrous boost which you can use to make your motorcycle go faster. You magically regain nitrous fuel as well as health and earn extra cash by taking out motorcyclists and other vehicles.-----In some stages you also have jets that allow you to jump and glide. It’s ridiculous but, I thought this was awesome because it was just like riding a motorcycle from one of my all time favourite games, Full Throttle. The problem with it is that there is no indication when it runs out of fuel needed to boost you over a void.-----After completing each stage you can spend your cash on items, most of which last until you die. Items effects range from recovering lost health, minor increases to your rewards for taking out other vehicles and completing races or extra lives albeit with the loss of most of your maximum health.-----When you lose all your health during a stage you finally die for real and it’s game over man. You will have earned experience based on the total amount of cash you earned in your run. Your experience can be used to purchase upgrades which will carry over to future attempts at the campaign.Currently there doesn’t seem to be any sign of the ‘truly epic quest’ story line. But it will cool to see it and online multiplayer in future updates. Personally I wish there was open world MMO game like this with minimal ‘RPG’ elements, I think that would be awesome.-----This game was challenging, I only made it halfway through the campaign after numerous attempts at it. Sometimes what you are rolled with can be really difficult even on the first level.-----But it’s fun. And I think the price is reasonable for amount of content as well as the potential replayability that the game offers. I definitely recommend thinking about getting this game.Since writing this I have completed the game in it's current state. It's actually not very long at the moment, although I did say the game had a good amount of content. But an update is scheduled soon. Presumably more content will be released with this update.Also I recommended using keyboard and mouse in my 'review'. However after using keyboard and mouse more I realized that the gamepad is actually a lot easy to maneuver your motorcycle with.﻿Clickherefor my YouTube gaming channel"

,Recommended,300380,12169097,"Posted: 20 September, 2014",all,Randys950,"-+-EARLY ACCESS REVIEW-+-This game is still in the early stages, so buying a product this early in development will always be a risk. So far, I've had alot of fun playing this title.  Ton's of action, laugh out loud moments, and on a few occasions my jaw dropped.  I've played roughly 2 1/2 hours of the campaign so far, and haven't reached the final mission yet.  There's alot of challenges and various missions.  A lot of features are still missing in Road Redemption, and I'm hoping the $20 dollars I spent on this purchase will go a long way as development continues.  This feels like Road Rash, a title that hasn't been released in over a decade.I can neither recommend or not recommend this game, as far as its too early to judge.  A twenty-dollar bill weights differently in people's pockets, but there is ALOT of promise, momentum, and potential in Road Redemption.  So purchase this game under your own risk with faith this game will be completed before the price spikes up.Gameplay is there, the graphics are absolutely fine, I just feel like the empty content is holding Road Redemption back.6/10(Once some more game modes are released like a quickplay(just choosing to race or do takedown missions with multiplayer options) are introduced, I'd give it an 8.75)"

I'd compare the combat with the horse mounted battles of Mount and Blade, only on a hyper-speed motorcycle that can boost. It's extremely satisfying to line up a perfect critical hit with a battle axe against a cluster of rival bikers.The way the cars and characters are constantly flying across the screen in a physics-tornado of destruction is incredible. The gameplay loop of short racing/combat challenges, buying temporary upgrades, and then applying earned XP to persistent skills is smart and addicting. The game is frequently updated by its developers.CONS:Performance inconsistency has been the one thing I have found frustrating, but it is to be expected at this early stage. The current build as of July 5th will fluctuate back and forth from over 100 FPS to 30-50 FPS in a matter of seconds and I'm running it on a GTX 970. Earlier builds ran really consistently, but as the has game progressed, the optimization has suffered. I expect later versions to run much better.I also feel that, at the harder difficulties especially, there is too much pipe bomb spam from enemies. It seems like a cheap way to artificially increase difficulty. I imagine that the devs will continue to balance the game to correct this in the future.FINAL THOUGHTS:I've gotten more than my monies worth at this point from this game. I can't wait to see what the devs bring to it in the future! I'd love to see an ""endless"" or open world RPG mode, perhaps in a sequel.As of 9/21/17, the game's performance is really solid."

It is still supported and actively being worked on. They actually want to make this game and complete it. The developer gives you a number to call, they are dedicated to their work.While the menus are a little clunky looking, you can tell that it's made with love. The graphics are relatively good, by no means bad. It looks very pretty, although I think the draw distance could due to have a little bit of an upgrade, but it's unity so it makes sense.If you're into racing, motorcycles, kicking people into oncoming traffic, whacking people upside the head with shovels and nailed bats, shooting your way into first place, and blowing up police cars, then you're gonna be into this game."

It keeps getting more updates, fine tuning, and somehow better with every patch.The racing is done well, the combat is done very well, and the sense of speed is fantastic. It's tremendously satisfying to kill opponents with the melee weapons, and the sense of ""GOTCHA!"" that you get lining up a head shot while speeding down a highway will leave you beaming until you crash head on into oncoming traffic. Which reminds me.... grabbing other racers and steering them into oncoming traffic might just be the most satisfying way to kill in this game. RPG elements extend the lifespan of the game greatly, giving you something to buy at the end of each game that will enhance your abilites in the next attempt.This game might not be something you sit down and play for hours and hours at a time.

That being said, there are a few problems that prevent me from fully enjoying the game. Nothing against the devs though, it is early access afterall. So this is more of a ""Heres what I think should be fixed list"". If you are unsure if you will like the game, watch the trailer again.1. Hitting roadside objects and cars rarely knocks me off my bike. Instead I stop dead in my tracks and get stuck for several seconds like driving into a corner in Mario Kart 64.2. Some roadside objects have very bad hitboxes. In the desert level (first one in quick play), if you hit the large piles of rocks, you can stop dead in your tracks several feet away, drive up the rocks while hovering over them, and get stuck in mid-air.3. Without using the quick turn key, turning is far too slow. It almost rewards having the key constantly held down. Maybe have better handling normally and sharper turns to use the quick turn key?4. This one's completely subjective, but maybe you could have the option to have Road Rash style crashes. Then you would skid to a stop and tumble, just to get back up and walk to your bike. It always seemed like a more memorable gameplay feature to me.Anyway, I really look forward to playing this game more, and I hope that some of these issues are addressed in a future update. Honestly, I have wanted a game like this ever since RR on the Saturn, and this is a great attempt at such a game. Now if only we could get a new F-Zero game..."

I was interested in buying this game because of a youtuber I watched. If you like shooting or hitting people with shovels and you like racing games then this is definitely for you. The campaign is decently long, and the levels get tougher. Some of the levels include racing on rooftops with a grappling hook. However, I do have some problems with this game. The AI needs to be fixed up. Some of the maps need to be tweaked a bit. Finally, upgrading your racer is really weird. Why not remove this since it's so confusing.In ConclusionFor an early access game it's a good start. However, I'm afraid that this game will lose its hype. The updates are rather slow. Many problems need to be fixed, and hopefully the community grows. I really want this game to become the greatest; if not, the best road dash ever. The concept is very interesting.

Highly recommended.-- Original review written 2/16A year and a half later, I'm still playing ROAD REDEMPTION (over 150 hours in), but the game hasn't stood still. New music, a campaign story with voiced NPCs, reworked inventory system, rebalanced skill tree, new perks and penalties, new bikes and riders, streamlined in-game UI... the list of changes to the single-player game is enormous. It's an infinitely more polished, balanced, challenging roguelike.Multiplayer made it into beta over the summer, and has been up and down periodically as the devs tweak and tune the servers. It's exciting and I look forward to its wider release, but honestly multiplayer was never the draw for me. This is an insanely fun single-player game, still the best motorcycle combat experience for modern PCs.The ROAD RASH franchise never produced a title with online multiplayer. ROAD REDEMPTION has had local co-op for years, and is now on the verge of competitive multiplayer PvP. I believe ROAD REDEMPTION will set the standard for this genre into the next generation."

For me this game is a lot better.With the RPG like skill tree you can permanently upgrade health, NOS, attack damage and many more upgrades every time you play using the XP earned on each play through.I found it was pretty hard to complete at first, however once I'd got the hang of it and upgraded some skills and weapons it's become more manageable but still a challenge.There's plenty of weapons to use which come in 7 categories: Swords, Heavy weapons (like hammers, wrenches), Long weapons (like shovels, broom stick, double sided axe),  standard weapons (bat pipe, mace), Pistols, Automatic weapons and explosives (C4, grenade launcher). All of which (apart from explosives I believe) can be upgraded in between levels.The attacking is very responsive you can duck (when holding a gun) or block attacks from enemies and also kick them out of the way or you can grab them and force them in to oncoming traffic. Shooting people from their bikes very satisfying especially if they're firing at youThe game is not just about winning races whilst killing as many people as you can. There are 3 different scenarios which are randomly selected for each level. These are: Race, Beat the clock to the finish, Target takedown (eliminating marked targets before they escape). Of course it does pay to take out anyone and everyone you come across (literally)For each rider you eliminate whether or not they are in the race or not will reward you with health, NOS, money and XP.The game is an arcade style in that once you're dead you have to start over and battle through the 17 levels to complete the campaign.There are a number of different bikes to unlock of different speeds and handling and also several different riders. I don't think there are any difference in the riders skill wise but I just normally use the first guy. Think he's called Jonny Sizzle :DFor people that have friends that visit your house as opposed to online I really liked the split screen feature where up to 4 people can play at the same time on one copy of the game.I've heard that online multiplayer will be coming to the game on its full release too.

The huge road block at level 3 with the masters race has been taken out so now your progression in the game lasts beyond 10 minutes of gameplay. That was a big step forward to making this game enjoyable. They didn't remove the black semi truck which used to be extremely annoying, but it no longer matches your speed when you are in range of it, therefore it's annoyance factor isn't really an issue anymore. I am no longer getting hit for over 50 percent of my health from one melee attack and In the few games I have played since the latest patch I am no longer experiencing the rider that blocks every melee attack no matter how well you time your attacks. This is also a huge improvement.I am still keeping my fingers crossed that there will be a game mode inserted later in development which brings back the series of racing for points and progression to higher racing leagues which the old Road Rash games had.

The driving is easy enough to control and the maps are randomized, which keeps things interesting. Lots of shortcuts sprinkled throughout. Four types of upgradeable weapons plus the ability to kick riders out of the way and the ability to grab onto someone or parry their attacks keeps the combat entertaining and varied, especially when you get put up against a variety of foes.There are quick, fun, quick local multiplayer races if you just want to hop in and play wherein you can win by either outracing your opponents or killing them so that they can't finish the race. Most appealing is the excellent rogue-like campaign mode wherein you frequently die and lose, but can earn experience that you can spend upon permanent upgrades for future attempts. There are a huge amount of unlockable upgrades, from stat boosts to characters to cycles.The campaign itself pits you against a series of short missions which can range from races to killing X number of enemies before they reach the finish line to beat the clock to simple survival. Your health and nitro boost carries over from level to level, so you have to be judicious about how to play, though you can gain both back gradually by taking out other riders. You do tend to lose 25% of your health if you fail a mission and continue forward as long as you are alive. You also earn money along the way which you can use to purchase upgrades for that playthrough.It's a really well designed and implemented game for this genre. Highly recommend."

If you are thinking of buying it, I suggest waiting to see if things such as control/physic improve.It has the potential to be a fun and engaging experience, saddly it fails to deliver a smooth and consistent experience. While it ""runs"" exceptionally well with next to no problems there are a number of design flaws that are more then apparent.Bike Handling seems to sit between an arcade style and driving a brick on an skating rink. At times the handling sensativity goes from very low and unresponsive to a twich style that overcompensates for what your aiming to do. This becomes very noticable while trying to corner only to slide off a rooftop (or bounce off one)Overall Physics/Hit Detection are terribly ballanced with riders able to effortlessly push and overpower you from side to side while vehicles are able to bounce you like a ball in a pinball machine. To your own bike hitting into other riders moving the slightest bit. As far as object/hit detection goes, often I found my self coliding dead on with various world objects only to be stopped dead in my tracks, having to utilize the ""reverse"" controll to fix my positioning so I could go to the center of the roadway again.Combat while fun also falls to some major design oversights. Melee combat is divided between two buttons for left and right attacks, taking up two keys that by all rights could be done by one with side detection being utilized from what direction your leaning. The developer ""claims"" to have tried this but found this was better, how I am unsure as using any typical controller this layout is non intuative and uncomfortable. Ranged Weapon combat is plauged by it's use of the camera to do the aiming. This then puts strain on not only the poor driving mechanics but having to manage the camera being locked inplace waiting for movement as opposed to following the bike while not in use! A terrible design oversight as you are forced to constanlty ""aim"" while your weapon is out or use the non intuitve means of selecting a different weapon. Lacking dedicated weapon ""slots"" also leaves something to be desired.My last issue comes to difficulty and penalties for failure. While in theory having a single life system sounds like a fun engaging way to reward progress. It is handicapped by an over the top health reduction of typically 50% of your max health for not completing your objective with in the rather narrow window provided to do so. Either from poor bike/combat controlls to a lack of overall HP to progress through each ""forced"" fight engagement. While in theory a great way to minimize combat issues it only adds more through being forced into fighting more then you may want or are able to.Bundle the above issues and you end up with something that comes across as a good concept only to find that it executes all of it very poorly."

I really would love for a spiritual successor of the series to continue off.However this game feel  short in many ways, and as a fan of the original for that reason I cannot recommended it.The first glaring problem is the visuals. The game is plastered with effects (heavy fog / post processing / bloom effects) that contrast with the aesthetics of the orgiinal series.The original road rash series had amazing visibility, bright vibrant colors, and very little in the way of visual clutter.Road Redemption however looks like it was ran through a series of Instagram filters that do nothing but ruin the game play (making it extremely hard to see where you are and where other bikers are).As an early access title I would assume the developers would be open feedback and potentially changing addressing these issues, however suggestions have fallen on deaf ears.

Not only that, it adds an in-depth upgrade system.Initially, I did not like the way you lose all your upgrades upon death. As you keep the same health, unless you heal, from wave to wave. Then I realized when you die, there's permanent upgrades you can acquire that last game after game and the in-game upgrades are the carrot at the end of the stick for trying to get to those further and further waves. Overall, it's a brilliant system and I'm really looking forward to what this games turns into upon final release.There's some minor niggles with the camera (it's all mouselook) so you have a hard time keeping upon with the action sometimes or other times you'll notice it just feeloffand then correct it upon thinking about it. Which can bring you out of the game. However, it almost feels necessary for when you get a gun to have that free aim. So it might be something you just need to get used to.I highly recommend getting this game whether or not you played the Road Rash of yore. The procedural tracks are fun and feel solid. Not just cobbled together. The weapons are diverse and quite fun to use. Especially the sledgehammer and old Remington from Terminator. I'm sure they will be adding a lot more content as well such as more bikes and players but in some races there's even a giant truck to contend with!

What I enjoy about the game is that it features the same antics in racing that one gets out of Rod Rash.  While it is important to get a higher position, in this game, it gives more focus on attacking other cyclists.  That being said, it has alternate modes that it goes into that wasn't in prior Road Rash games I had played (granted the last I played was Road Rash for Windows 95, which was the same version on the 3DO console).  There are some odd places you travel, one being a path that features cars raining from the sky, and the player must dodge them.  Also, I find it interesting that such a game was authored in Unity3D; it is really proving how the technology is progressing.Unfortunately, the game has some quirks.  Granted it is a mere ""arcade"" feel game, it doesn't focus on how a motorcycle or a car would actually travel on the road.  This is a mere notice as many people buy into games such as Mario Kart where they do not implement natural turning of a vehicle, but rather the rear of the vehicle pivots.  (contras this to say Tux Kart which gives a better example of how turning occurs with vehicles).Additionally, the game has bugs where it randomly crashes on the Linux platform, typically after permanent experience level ups are awarded after dying.  Also, I'm not sure if it is a bug, but I've seen ""cars"" identified as ""npc"" enemies that are holding position in the race, and I'm supposed to attack them.  Again, maybe this is on purpose?  But I haven't contacted the developer to see.At any rate, I have to give serious marks down on stability on the Linux platform, but overall, the game has a fun factor.  I have to recommend it at this time, but as time progresses, if these issues are not addressed, I will change my rating to negative; not because I want to as its a great game, but if the game does not work, what does one really have?"

I dont mean that in strickly a bad way, but going in with that expectation might leave a bad taste in your mouth.The addition of guns and bombs change the dynamic from a racing brawler to war on the road. And this is the big difference in core gameplay from something like road rash. As shooting someone with a mp5 is a lot quicker that hitting him with a water pipe.Additionnally this does not follow the race to win money to buy new bike formula we saw in road rash. It follows more of a post apocaliptic bounty hunter, surviving from race to race with what health you have left.The developers are constantly working on the game, it has changes substantially from when i got it to now. Lots of quality of life additions. AI has been improved. Addtion of story line and voice acting.One great thing is they kept the kicking from Road Rash!

(but you can get burgers and such between the levels if you've earned enough cash)Anything negative?Only something I personally have a hard time with, the driving while also aiming with right thumbstick and firing with right button, like in GTA V, I'm not a huge fan of it due to having a hard enough time aiming with right thumb stick standing still. :) (as it seems I'm the only one in the universe being 100% crap at that thing the game will be flawless for everyone else ;))I don't regret buying it that's for sure and I even bought two extra copies that I'll give away on my Youtube channel, no, I won't let you know even its name....I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ am I not? :) (I can say that it'll happen very early August, so searching for ""Road Redemption giveaway"" might work - and I won't even ask for a sub.

You can kick people into oncoming traffic, off buildings, into signs and construction equipment, or you can just straight up shoot them/hit them with your weapons.  A lot of the levels are just replays like the rooftop levels, the only difference is how the AI reacts.  The worst thing for me in this game is how long it takes you to come back to life when you slam into a vehicle.  Watching counters it takes about 3-4 seconds to get back on the track, whats worse is when you try to use your nitrous to catch up to where you were and within ten feet of starting where you respawned you crash into another vehicle and have to wait to respawn again. The games fun for the most part.  Very Repetitive.  I have a friend who comes over and we play together which makes it a little more fun because you can take eachother on.  When playing co-op whoever finishes the best in a race is the score the entire group gets, when killing people all the kills are shared.One thing i hate is getting crazed drivers mode on the rooftops, it essentially does nothing.  If it actually had drivers on the rooftops it would be different.

I played as Santa Claus on a chopper, kicking, beating, and maiming other riders all the while confused as to whether I was in it to win a race or just to hurt other riders.  As it was still in Early Access, I decided to move on to other games I had acquired from the usual seasonal sales that occur.  I loosely followed the progress of this game, including that the game would finally be making it to final release.  I became curious when my game was retitled to include ""Review Copy"".  It looked like version 1.0 was finally upon us.  A friend of mine jumped into it recently and gave me an inkling to try this game again.  It appeared to have gone through many changes.This is notRoad Rash.  I acquired this title on the premise of reliving my time with that oldie.  While I can see what the devs were trying to accomplish, and why they would bill it as a spritual successor to the Road Rash series, it just does not invoke rememberance of those games.  That is not to say it is a bad game.  It is a game very much trying to appeal unto that nostalgic feel, with the clumsy riding physics and focus on combat on motorcycles.  This game is a Rogue Lite with the ability to purchase temporary boosts for a given playthrough and unlock permanent perks that may aide you in the next playthrough.  The loading screen indicates that the routes are randomly generated and populated.  Objectives may vary from being first to the checkpoint in sprint-style races speeding from point A to point B while combating opposing riders, or knocking out a certain number of opponents before you run out of track.  As you progress, the tracks begin in include more traffic, tougher enemies, and pickups for explosives and ranged weapons.This game is fast, and it is frantic.  This game is over the top with cliche's and action.  This game is rough around the edges, particularly with control of the bikes, but it is also beautiful in its own right.  With continued developement for years since its initial release in Early Access, the dev team can be applauded for supporting their creation.  I also applaud their up front support of streamers and lets players in this current climate of DMCA nonsense that has taken hold of the likes of YouTube.  I hope the devs continue to support this game, tweaking the mechanics and maybe adding new modes.  I look forward to caving in my friends' helmets online when the title is finally released.

You can't go wrong with riding bikes and beating the living entrails out of law enforcement and other rivals on the road.There is no story to the game at all. (YET at least) No characters to identify with. The rival gangs have names but no identities. You can't pick and choose what kind of person or what kind of sex your person is. Other than skills, there is no customization options. Menus and interface are not terrible but need some work. Also don't like how you loose your skill points if you don't use them. There don't seem to be any checkpoints anywhere between races in the game... once you die its all they way back you go. VERY annoying.Visuals are decent but not top notch. HOWEVER I've noticed significant improvements recently in both graphics and performance. Gameplay and contoller support still leave a little to be desired. It's particularly difficult to aim firearms and keep control of the bike. I'd like to see them tweek that part of the mayhem a tad.

,Recommended,300380,26563176,"Posted: 12 November, 2016",all,Renegade,"Firstly,if I could mark this review as neutral I would. This is a fun and challenging game but it's more than a bit clunky, though it doesn't irritate me enough that I would give this game a negative review. What it has to fall back on is the fact that it's early access, and for an early access game it'sfairlysolid, but it seems like the devs consider the game a finished product which is only missing multiplayer. In my opinion there's more refinement needed here than just adding multiplayer, especially if the price is set to go up once it's fully released.The game has two campaign modes, the standard campaign and the harder campaign+ which you unlock by completing the standard one. I enjoy the campaigns, but the way they work feels kind of flawed. Throughout both modes you accumulate XP for completing levels and killing enemies, and when you die or complete the campaign, you're presented with an upgrade tree where you can spend that XP. The reason I think this is a bit flawed is because the standard campaign is easy to beat without unlocking any of these skills, but if you want to spend your XP on unlocking new bikes to use in another playthrough or campaign+, you can't because you first have to increase your max health and unlock a bunch of other permanent buffs - by the time you get to unlocking new bikes, you'll have so many buffs that neither of the campaign modes will be even a slight challenge, and there's not much replay value in that.A couple of other issues I've found are:- The AI is strange, especially friendly AI. Friendly riders have a habit of hitting me, driving right next to me and preventing me from steering (because steering into them doesn't move them at all, and they move back towards you if you kick them away), and knocking me off course by flying into the back of me to catch up if they fall behind. They're far more annoying than they are helpful. Enemy AI is generally better, but the respawning enemies who spam explosives which are timed to go off the second you drive past them can be a bit excessive, especially on levels where it's also raining vehicles.- A few campaign+ missions (destroy the convoy or chase and kill the gang leader) are near enough impossible because the targets move so fast and escape long before you can catch up - the only way I've been able to complete these, without unlocking any permanent buffs, is by having a harpoon handy, which you won't always have.On a more positive note, it's a honest project and the devs are trying, which is good and refreshing, considering there are plenty of early access scams all over Steam. The game looks decent graphics wise and performance is stable - I don't think I've ever experienced a crash in about 14 hours of total gameplay (currently 12 and a couple in offline mode), but on the main screen there is an email address to send some details to if you do experience a crash, which is a nice touch by the devs."
76561198081329961,Recommended,300380,16899324,"Posted: 5 July, 2015",all,ALL CAPS,"I've only had the game for a little while, but it's pretty fun. I'm not really familiar with the Road Rash series, but upon learning about it's general concept, and seeing this game, I decided to try it out. It's a pretty fun, fast paced game, and it's pretty challenging too. For the most part, I have no complaints.However, I do have 2, and they are pretty much the only sources of dislike for this game. The first is the physics and hit-detection. For example, when careening down the highway, say you hit a car head-on. Most times, as expected, you'll go flying off your bike. However, sometimes, you'll instead be pushed by the car while still on your bike, and you won't be able to move until it knocks you off your bike. This same scenario can happen if a car or truck hits you from behind, or if you hit a random pipe or box in the road or on the side. You'll be stuck, and you can't move, unless you manage to shimmy out of the scenario. In a fast-paced game like this one, no matter how good you drive, one mistake can mean the difference between success and failure.The other has to do with damage (and enemy hit detection), which I find wildly inconsistent. For example, I can be going at it with a rival biker, and our weapons clash against each other. For some reason, I'll still take damage, even though a) the enemy doesn't, and b) the enemy weapon hit my weapon, not my body. Also, there have been plenty of times where I can be hit with a pipe and even with max health, instantly be killed, while I can be hit by c4 and only lose half of my life. It seems like no matter how much life you have, with the inconsistent damage, you can truly feel safe on the road.Regardless, even with those bugs, the game is still worth it. It's a very challenging game, but if you can overcome, you'll be handsomely rewarded. In it's current state, 7/10 for me."

You'll be cruising along on a motorbike while wielding all manner of weaponry, attempting to get ahead of rivals and police alike. (And by ""get ahead"" in this game, we frequently mean ""cause mortal injuries"".)This game is still in early access at the time of writing, and of course that means it might not be the most polished game you'll buy. And no, it's not – but it's by no means bad on any count. The graphics are okay, and the fact that it hails back to an old classic does, in my opinion, give it some leeway on graphics, because it can add to the nostalgia factor. The levelling and upgrade systems have recently had an overhaul, and I haven't had much time to play with the new versions but I think they're an upgrade over the old versions.Things I like:- The difficulty. It's not easy. A few levels in, I find there's a *lot* to watch out for, and the enemies are much tougher (possibly a little too tough, or maybe I'm just bad at the game!)- The ""hallucinagenics"" levels. That's creative, and makes for a slightly different level to most of the rest.- The weapons. Great range of weapons, and I see they've had some upgrades since I last played; you didn't decapitate people with the swords, last time I played Road Redemption. Now you do.- The actual bike driving. It feels gritty, fast-paced, and ... well, not realistic, but something along those lines.- Unlockables. This is, I think, a new addition. I like that there are bikes and riders to unlock now, and that the bikes have different stats. That adds something to the gameplay.Things I don't like:- The sound. This is pretty much my only big bug-bear; there's very little sound in the game at present.- The difficulty. I know I put it in the list above too. I just wish that there were some choies of difficulty setting.I have a few ideas for improvements, and I'll be running those ideas past the devs in the discussion boards.  Meanwhile, it's great to see early access devs who are actually working on their game, even months after release."

You need to definitely level up a bit to even stand a chance against the later levels in the campaign or just pure mastering of all you have at your disposal.

Needless to say, I was excited when I found out about Road Redemption.The main campaign has 12 levels. The object of each level varies. Some will be a normal race, others will be about eliminating others by knocking them off of their bikes. There's also different environments for these levels. Some take place in a desert, others in the snow and some on top of rooftops. There's an upgrade system in the game as well. As you beat levels in the campaign, you gain XP. You can use the XP to get upgrades which will make things easier for you. You'll likely obtain all of the upgrades in a short period of time, but it's still nice to have. One thing I don't like about it this game is the rubber banding. It seems to be a bit much, sometimes to the point of feeling unfair. Hopefully they fix that or at least improve it.Thus far, I've put in 20+ hours, beaten the game multiple times and unlocked every achievement.

The skill trees and money upgrades are a welcome addition to keep things fresh and replayability high.

The jump jets do a good job of letting you launch over cars, but wheelies were a staple in the Road Rash series that are sorely missed in this game.Another thing I was not a fan of is that the unlockable bikes are usually worse than the starting bike, and the same goes for the unlockable characters.  To me, unlocking characters that make the game harder are just not enjoyable, but that's just a personal opinion.Just nit picking here, but the sound effects for the bikes aren't the greatest, even the crotch rockets sound like harleys.Overall, I've had a blast playing game.  I've been a supporter since the kickstarter and I'm not disappointed.  Great job!"

The soundtrack is some decent metal, and the overall vibe is one of getting better and better as you progress. It is an indie through and through. The budget isn't huge, the graphics will not blow your mind, but overall the aesthetic is pretty cool, and there is a very decent single player experience here with a lot of different ways to play with the weapons they give you. I like the blood and the no holds barred carnage with dynamite and bombs. It's not a perfect game, but it's actually pretty fun.I'm putting in my two cents for this game as well. Since its debut it has come a long way. After the last Summer patch I can officially say this is going to be the next Road Rash. Even in its unfinished state the improvements and development have turned a somewhat middling but good core game into a full product.This instantly brings me back to the days of the Genesis and cartridges in the 90s. They have nailed the melee in the game at this point, and graphics have shaped up nicely from the earlier more predestrian output. The upgrade system and AI of the other players has received a huge boost and it finally feels like it should. A few things still need some work, but overall this is a must buy for any fan of Road Rash. Period."

An assassins has (I would assume) killed someone high ranking in 1 of the major gangs (Reapers, Sigma & Phantoms) and there is a bounty on his head. You race and murder your way through the gang teritories to kill this assassin.GameplayNow this is where the fun starts. Each stage has ""Randomised Levels"" however if you play long enough you will see patterns to levels and expect things like shortcuts to be at specific places in some levels. Though not an issue as these are valuable to timed levels and often have guns and boosters on them - sometimes it's not a shortcut but infact a longer route due to hazzards. If you are going too fast and have to adjust in the air for for landing platform sometimes you can fly off the edge.Weapons are broken into 4 catagories:Blunt, Sharp, Guns & Explosives and most can be upgraded with money at the end of each level.The game uses a form of standard logic: A sword will not do much damage to someone wearing a helmet, A long weapon will take longer to use but hit more people, explosives will also kill you even if you placed them.As the game progresses enemies become harder to deal with - in Stage 1 you can breeze through every level killing everyone with a pole and never taking any damage. By stage 3 woull spend more time blocking, ducking, dodging and boosting out of situations as enemies attack faster.Before each play of the story you will also get to pick your Rider and your Bike - each rider and bike has their own set of properties for a different game - some riders start with 75% HP but get 125% Boost. Others start with guns over poles and knives. This is a good way to spice up gameplay each playthrough as you can unlock new riders and bikes as well.The game also has 2 leveling mechanics: In game and Overall. You can level things in game per playthrough with Cash to get more overall HP or refill health and upgrade guns and equipment. However if you die or complete the game these are lost. If you die or complete the game you are greeted with the EXP screen where you can buy upgrades to Cash, EXP, Health, Nitro and other permanent features for future playthroughs.OverallPerformanceStoryGameplayOverall10/105/109/108/10The story is basic enough to be completely glossed over but still gives a reason to the game and dialogue over just killing things and being in timed zones or killing x amount of them or racing them. The gameplay is solid but the camera when using guns is static meaning you have a choice: See where you are going or shoot.This game is still in early access but after changing its name to Review Copy in my library I feel it may be leaving early access soon (Q4 2017 - Q1 2018) which will be nice as I have watched this game over its development cycle and have enjoyed it in all stages.Overall I would Highly reccomend this game and suggest that if you played Road Rash 3D on PSX and do not own this game - You buy it and relive those years in 1080p+ 60FPS. Play the game like you remember the game!"

,Recommended,300380,35056707,Posted: 18 September,all,Robin,"god DAMNIT i love this game. I love it! Road Redemption can be thought of as a spiritual successor to Road Rash- but It has a lot more going for it. I picked this up a while ago, and at the time it was still pretty unstable, but heck, it was in alpha then, and STILL FUN. (Prototypes are prototypes! instability is accessible in the pursuit of a good experience)- that out the way: Let's unpack.=================================================================COMBAT:The combat is CRUNCHY! the attacks have good pacing, anticipation, and killing people feels Gooood. There are numerous ways to kill people, such as kicking them off bridges, to slicing their heads off (which does indeed give you a bonus)- the combat in this game FEELS tight, and the pacing is generally pretty good for it, which leads me to the next bit.LEVELS:The levels in this game are procedurally generated. If you're still reading this means that while the levels do lack individual charm, they do make up for in replayability. It's not about memorizing turns, so much as it is taking advantage of new occurences: Giant cliffside? Kick your enemies off. close two way traffic? kick them into traffic. tight roads? line them up and gun them down. I think if theres any game where procedural generation really has a chance to shine with solid mechanics- It's this one.NARRATIVE/STORY:There is one. It's pretty cheesy. It's post SOMETHING and there are mean biker gangs peroling the street. This game could use some consistency moving forward, but I can see the story elements emerging, and it's definitely much further along than before. This isn't a game to play for the story.Overall:This game is STILL EARLY ACCESS. sometimes it lags. it used to lag a lot more. Game development is fickly and takes time- and this team is still working on it (receives regular updates)-I HIGHLY recommend this game for anyone who likes combat racing games. It's fun, it's fun to play with friends, and it has replay value- and it's only going to get better. I easily paid $20 for it, and if it was on sale, I'd buy it for my friends."

76561198035419477,Recommended,300380,32765781,Posted: 25 June,all,Brownee,"Leading up to my purchase of this game, I went back and played a bunch of Road Rash on PC. Enjoyed it, but the novelty of Road Rash wears off reasonably quickly, it's only 5 races, and 5 levels that extends those 5 races by a reasonable distance. Dying and/or wrecking or getting arrested with no money to repair or bail resets the game. Perma-death is annoying like that.So when I got into this game, just looking at the trailers, everything pretty much seemed Road Rash looking, but with a proper 3D design, and a bigger variety of weapons. All seemed good.The amount of time I played in my first session though, I was getting a little annoyed. Progression is HARD... initially. Everything you do gives you XP, which you spent on talents after the campaign, or when you die. Those talents are permanent (though player progress in general can be reset in the options if that's desired). And those are the only permanent things. If you start a campaign, you'd best be prepared to finish it because there's no saving where you are, there's no coming back later. If you die or quit, you start again (though eventually there's talents to start at certain levels).That factor is kind of annoying, but it also compells you to go back and play more, because I want these other riders, I want these extra bikes... God damn it, I want Shovel Knight! But to do that, I need to finish the campaign a couple times, but to do THAT, I need to fail a few times.Sure it's possible to finish a campaign without the upgrades and the failing, but good lord is it hard.But you know, as you could expect, the more upgrades you get, the more fun the game gets. Even if it means failing a bunch at the start. Power through it and you're rewarded with something incredibly fun.So far there's only one thing I can complain about. That's the grappling hook weapon... I could be using it wrong, but it honestly feels like it adds nothing. I thought it could be used to make sharper turns easier, or hook other riders to the ground and make them wreck, but nope. One of the trailers shows him hooking a helicoptor and swinging off it, but doing that in game provides no advantage at all. If anything it's more likely to screw you. There's no harm in grabbing it, but there's no reason to use it.Outside the campaign there's some quick races on select maps, as you'd expect. No multiplayer yet, though the main menu of the game says that it's in Beta. That's definitely something to look forward to.It's definitely a fun game and I would recommend it. Particularly if you're a fan of Road Rash. For an Early Access game, it pretty much provides what Road Rash was, and more. I got what I was hoping for, and more than I expected, very little of which is bad. It's an improvement in the purest form.I do picture the novelty of the game wearing off reasonably quickly like Road Rash, but games like these provide the sort of fun that you occasionally feel compelled to come back to for some dumb over the top fun. Not to mention even if I do feel like taking a break from it eventually, I'll personally come back to it frequently to see how it's updated. I want to see how far they can take this silliness. Multiplayer would certainly help that."

Playing local coop with my daugther thirty minutes into the game (almost 10) she was say that this is one of the best games ever.  Not sure about that part yet but it certainly is a fun game and has the makings to be a very good game with further love and development by the developers.  It was certainly even with only an hour spent so far worth the money.   Is it rough around the edges?  Very.  Graphically it isn't anything to write home about.  Sound wise I can't say as we didn't have the sound playing.  I am not much on sound effects anyway so I usually am not big on reviewing that side of games.  I love soundtracks but only when I am playing OST burnt to CDs in my car.  Anyway to me this type of game is all about is it fun.  This isn't a game that is meant to be complex looking so the graphics really aren't that big of deal to me.  They are smooth for the most part so that is what I care about.  There are a few clipping issues that I am sure will get worked out.  Texture wise this isn't meant to be a game you are going to stop and look at the roses anyway.     Control wise I played via keyboard and my daughter via offical 360 controller.  We have a second 360 contoller but I was too lazy to hook up so I am going on her word about the contoller controls but she didn't seem to have any real problems with them.   The keyboard controls using the default WASD/Keyboard controls were fair but had some drift in them.  I am sure the developers will tighten up the controls as game development goes along so I am not too worried about that.   However contol in this type of game is one of the bigger issues worth looking at so if you are wondering as far as July 5th, 2015 at least as far as keyboard controls I can say that the bikes do control a ""floaty"" that I would like.   Once again this is a EA title and I am sure this will  change.   As far as overall game concept this game follows along with the old Road Rash feel and that is perfect for me.  The game is FUN.  Is it perfect, nope.  Was I expecting it to be at this point, nope.   Do I think it has the chance to become a great game, yes.  At this point in development do I feel like it is worth risking the full asking price of $20?  Yes if you played Road Rash or looking for a fun game that doesn't take itself too serious then I do.   The game doesn't have a lot of ""meat"" in it yet but even so what is on the bones so far is worth the money.  I have spent a lot more for a lot less fun."

I remember trading my SNES for my friend's Genesis a lot of weekends in Jr. High, and the Road Rash series was one of the biggest reasons. This game takes the timeless concept of armed crazies on motorcycles racing on public roads for fame and fortune to another level.Probably the biggest upgrade, online multiplayer, isn't implemented yet, but what is here now is already as fun as the original games. What's already been added to the original schematic is local multiplayer, rooftop levels, ""hallucinatory"" levels with cars falling from the sky and crashing into each other at every turn, awesome avatars with flaming jack-o-lantern heads, and a permanent experience based upgrade path on top of the cash upgrades that dissapear after each game ends.

I recommend it because it's still in early access and has some work to do, but the game as a final product in it's current state feels absolutely generic. If within a year it hasn't progressed, I'll gave to give this a pass.The game is a ton of fun. It's Road Rash, motorcycle racing game mixed with a beat-em-up game. They changed some things up to make it a little more interesting. There's a skill tree. You can die, which requires you to start all the way over. You can shoot people and change out weapons during a race. There's also crazy drug races where cars are just flying all over the place.The biggest complaint I have is that the actually racing and feel to the bikes are way off. There's little regard to real physics not gravity in the game. The races use a rubber band method to attach each other side-by-side so you easy bust face with bat. And while that's fine, Road Rash was always a blast because you're have to maintain your speed to side-by-side. It never just locked you into that place to attack.My overall recommendation is to wait this one out until it's final, unless you see a cheap deal."

It is no where near the acheivement that Road Rash was but with this being early access I am hoping it can get closer to it. Currently it is not worth the price tag. There is no where near enough content to keep you going longer than a few hours. The races are short which can be irritating if you fall off near the as you will not have enough time to catch up, they are quite often extremely hectic and it is primarily luck that ensures you get through it. There can be bombs exploding, cars flying everywhere, cars swerving all over the road and occasionally cars that fall from the sky in the aptly titled halucineagenic zone.  There are two lots of upgrades, temporary ones which last for as long as you are alive and are bought with cash won from races and ones you buy once dead with the XP you have earned whilst alive. This is quite fun but again not a patch on Road Rash. I would like to see shops in which to purchase new bikes and parts to upgrade the one you have and new outfits to buy and things like armour. The races need to be longer as you are just getting into them when they come to an end, an end which allows you to carry on riding until the gane loads. I would like to see something of a story too, not anything dramatic like Grandma needs a new hip but doesn't have insurance so I race to pay for it kinda crap but just yes we race it's what we do. In Road Rash there was characters I didn't want to fight with as they always said nice things to me and there were jerks you didn't mind repeatedly bashing. Something like that is always fun. And dear god please lose the Mariocart level, currently the last level, riding on a rainbow in space? Come on, you lost me there.In summary this is a fun game and a good way to waste some spare minutes but so far the content is lacking and the races are too short. But otherwise an enjoyable experience, unfotunately not worth the current price tag."

(10/10)Gameplay: It's fun even if you play it few more times, you can use either firearms or cold weapons, both are useful. You have a choice of bikes and stuff. (10/10)Setting: Gangs, bikes and stuff in different parts of USA, gud nuff. (9/10)Controls: everything is fine as well, but deflection doesn't work for now. (7/10)Story: <Do you need any here?>Replayability: Kinda high cuz its the main thing about this game, you get skills that carry over to next playthroughs so it can be easier. I immediately played this game again and then Campaign +, was kinda disapointed not getting an achievement tho :c (to be fixed) (10/10)Overall rating: 9.2/10 (S)The game is worth buying, but beware of that its not so long one, you might want to go for all achivs (once they are fixed), otherwise you will overpay cuz of low time spent.EDIT: A lot of new stuff came to increase replayability of this game...

The game provides the feeling of speed/vertigo you would expect from a game like that as well as other feelings, like ""fiero"" and the joy of brutally overcoming adversity.On the other hand, I think the soundtrack needs some improvement and I wish PS4 controller support was already implemented.I would recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a good vehicular combat game or any Road Rash enthusiast.

We all know what game this reminds us older players of. Here we are in a different time to do it all again, better and brutal online. Im really looking forward to the coming year of updates to gauge the level invested by this Louisiana company.Features I find lacking or just bugs.- Poor leaning on the bike- No cat walks or stoppies- Double health skill carries to ng+ but starting level 3 & $1500 does not- Starting a race is always set up at paces from other bikes and based on distance, its possible to not start a race until you want there is no time limit just a bar telling you when you finish- Maybe add street races where you all have a starting line and the option to have a delay to use weapons- Buying from the store the double dmg for the next race is bs garbage, its a gamble. make it a xp skill- There is no proper way to quit after you finish a race and spend exp if youre not dead.- No proper brake, just forward and reverse. never puts leg down.- The check points between levels to buy stuff show have more random one type of item(e.g cb radio, +mass/kg but can hear chatter maybe learn a thing, chains as weapons, screwdrivers, mail boxes, a whip, road beers,♥♥♥♥♥♥jugs, etc)- More chatter between all motorists, gestures too.- Mission to get 4of 4 stars you have to drive slow before reaching the end. its a problem of too short of a distance.- Cash into exp store item should display the ratio of $:exp.- Disarming a rider does nothing but killing a guy nets you a weapon...kick a guy off a roof top much.- Hands not attached to the handle bars- The magnum hand gun is large compare to our players hand, compare it to the harpoon gun in size.- Why is it with a handgun equipped that three different buttons are used to fire a gun?- More race modes: Defeating mob bosses on bikes with gang in tow, Tsunami run where you stay ahead of the death hunting you down, Hallucinegenic Zone you have an ability to slow time(e.g Max Payne 3 online) allowing the rider to  duck and weave.- Intersections, over passes, on ramps off ramps. get those alt routes- Not enough variations, the style going is very spaced out 0_0- Steamworks or GTFOOverall 7, because there is only 7 levels and it plays very well. Its not even half way across to what appears the end. At this time the game is .827 in Early Access. I like the randomness and hope to see a roguelike story making choices. Im sure to spend many hours playing once multiplayer rolls upjuly 4 2015 - Alot has changed ng+ is tough and need to set yourself up to be able to compete so you dont die. basically if you barely beat a level and used all your boost you wont beat the next lvl. the new build look is nice, but it really shows how detailed it looks like a arcade cabinet game. There is still no multiplayer or bikes. Alot of fleshed out snags, power up attacks and more."
,Recommended,300380,12220429,"Posted: 24 September, 2014",all,Jet Uppercut,"Road Redemption isn't identical to Road Rash. Unlike what other reviews will have you think, this is certainly only Road Rash in the sense that you ride bikes and wallop cops with baseball bats. Also sometimes you have to race.While those things are a very large part of what Road Rash is, where this game is different is very obvious. It's got a much more arcade feel, with the one life is all you get policy. The melee battling is about countering enemy attacks so you can disarm them or critical hit them, rather than just zig zag punching them until they drop their 2x4.There's also guns. My personal favourite being the sawn off shotgun. Extremely satisfying to use and the reload animation is awesome. They aren't particularly difficult to use, being hitscan weapons. And since one shot is usually enough to put a rider out of commission you never seem to run out of ammo.The C4 is equally satisfying to use.The current race modes are a mixed bag. You can get anything from Jackie Chan's Kung Fu Kicking Competition to 10 tonne rain while trying to win a race. This isn't a bad thing by any means, the variety is good. But it's a far cry from Road Rash's rigid illegal street racing structure.And in the end it shows. The absence of a distinct race mode means the pace is set by the other modes where you try to kill as many cops or rival gang members as possible. And much of the time the race mode doesn't feel any different. The addition of punching bag bikers during a race slow down the pace considerably. I often found myself forgetting I had boost because I was having too much fun wailing on cops and these random dudes in the race and still ended up winning. Once again, this isn't a bad thing. But design wise I think it would be better to choose one or the other.On the few occasions a fellow gang member turned up, I found they would swing at me as they drove past. Their AI doesn't appear to be any different from the other bikers except that they prioritise the AI over you. In the full game I'm left wondering how establishing a biker gang and only having one life to do it all in will play off each other. I'd find it difficult to invest myself in a gang or my comrades if I knew the moment I died I would have to start all over.The Jump Jets attached to the bike during the rooftop level are a fun addition, but don't add much to overall gameplay on the non-rooftop levels. I often just ended up using them so I could shoot grenades at my feet. And cheat by jumping over crashes and huge logs. I never really found a use for the grappling hook, though it'd be fun if I could attach it to one of the helicopters seen flying over the tops of levels sometimes.Overall, I would recommend this game. But it is in a beta/alpha/whatever at the time of writing this review, so my impressions are obviously not going to be relevant when this game finally releases. Or at least I hope not because Road Redemption has a lot of potential."

Might have to block while turning while dodging that car, oh watch out for that semi behind you that slams into you.Rooftop levels....Cons:The physics sometimes don't do what you would expect. Like a head-on with a car might get you stuck against the hood rolling backwards instead of throwing you to the pavement.Currently the cars' drivers have a standin model that is just a crash test dummyThe grappling gun sometimes would attach to something behind or to the side rather than the target I'm aiming at.Overall:Great game, fun and fast.

But its pretty fun nonetheless.A few suggestions from a retro gamer -- Music can be improved a bit, what i mean here is, RoadRash had subtle sound tracks which went well with current route.- Crash mechanics could be better, like i get to a full stop by hitting a girder at high speed, not getting hurt. I mean, it is hardcore anything goes bike racing, but still, the more legit crashes the more fury in online mode.- Engine sounds can be improved, the first bike which is a racing type has a Harley-like engine sound which is a bit weird. Roadrash was all about sexy bikes anyways ;)- Much vivid scenary, yes this is early access, so can't expect more, but the graphics can be a bit more detailed, like with more brightness and contrast, like the eyepopping sky back in the days in RoadRash.Apart from these, man is it good to kick a fellow rider into oblivion!! :)Thanks for breathing life back into one of the classics!

Developers, please make the appropriate changes.- Should be ""an enemy's helmet"", not ""an enemys helmet"".http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=721679504- Should be ""you're racing"", not ""your racing"".http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=717913132- Usually, it should be ""Phill's mountain"", but if it is a place name (""Phills Mountain"") then the standard practice seems to be to drop the apostrophe (not that I'm happy with that, but that's how it is); so, this one could be alright to keep in.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=721681504Overall, it's an enjoyable game, especially if you have fond memories of playing Road Rash.Definitely a thumbs-up for this one!"

In the few months this has been in my libary this game has recieved alot of updates and polishing. This is a great couch co-op game. Its a has a near perfect feeling of road rash 64. The AI has been vastly improved and is actually fun to team up and bash in the rival gangs. The weapon loadouts are done very well and it great feeling to be ripping down the road throwing C4 into a crowd of enemies and watching them lauch everywhere. The exp progression is just weird. The skill tree just seems half asssed,  I would honestly just do away with it and start fresh. This game needs more bikes, maybe some king of modding of your bike to raise stats."
,Recommended,300380,32959186,Posted: 28 June,all,isaacbee,"This motorcycle racing/combat game is a blast. Taking down other bikers with a variety of melee weapons is fun, but even better is slapping a pack of C4 on another racer as you speed past and see them and their buddies get blown to smithereens in your rearview mirror. Basically this game feels like a playable action movie, albeit a ridiculously cheesy one where motorcyle drivers trade blows and gunfire while dodging around a hail of cars falling from the sky.Nailing someone with a gun is satisfying as well, but aiming can kinda be a pain, and it's almost impossible to hit anyone to the side or behind you since that requires turning the whole camera away from the road in front of you, and there aren't really any straightaways long enough to risk that without crashing and burning (but that doesn't stop the AIs from turning around and gunning you down from in front of you. This is further exacerbated in splitscreen multiplayer, where the reduced screen real-estate (and worse frame rate) makes it pretty hard to aim. I really enjoy the main campaign mode, but the skill tree kinda turns it into a Rogue Legacy style grind fest (I like both this game and Rogue Legacy, but I know some people get frustrated with those sorts of gameplay loops) where you just have to play a bunch before being equipped enough to actually win. Like I said though, I enjoyed the campaign, so needing to attempt it over and over wasn't a problem for me."

It's rare nowadays for many games to have this but a great thing when you want to play with family/friends on your side.On the cons side I would mention:- Ranged weapon handling is very hard using controllers at least.- Online mode will be a must for this game to have good success with most of the community (although playing locally is already very fun).- The difficulty degree of oponnents as you go through missions, increases drastically (or they simply become really sturdy) so some more tweaks to make it less steep would be good.- With online mode approaching, and probably a more competitive side to the game, more types of weapons like oil or spikes, would be a very good addition.Overall, the game is already fun and a very good approach to a genre that for years has been lacking (haven't seen one of this since Road Rash) but it still has lots of space to grow, improve and ultimately, I hope, surpass it's predecessors."

Also, the soundtrack is fantastic.  The developer has been very active, releasing updates as often as every day since I picked this up during the last summer sale.The downsides I've noticed include the interface, which is kind of ugly and poorly structured.

,Not Recommended,300380,13867927,"Posted: 6 January, 2015",all,Roundy,"I hope this review gets the devlopers attention while it is early access and has time to be fixed. I seriously want to love this game, but there are a lot of design flaws beyond bug fixes that simply do not make the game enjoyable.A great example of this is the skill tree, which should be scrapped entirely for a new unlock system that changes your starting weapons and unlocks new motorcycles. Increasing your health, xp gains, and cast earned isn't healthy game play fun - its grindy and does not feel rewarding to the player.Instead, picture that you only start the game off with a single character and bike, no weapons, and have to earn your way up the ranks. As you spend your xp after each match you unlock new characters (that start with a single weapon) or bikes with real differences. You shouldnt start each game with 3 weapons immediately, already on stage 3, and nearly irrelevant bike choices just because you played through a few times. I know it's early access - but this is the kind of thing that is getting old quickly.The game also completely lacks personality from the other racers, and to make it worse it is littered with a bunch of randomly spawned NPC's to up the action. Instead keep my 10 or so competitors and make them challenging, make them try to grab me and block my shots, or boost when I try to shoot at them. Give them names and pictures, dialouge, they need personality.Lastly, since right now your current objectives are all random - it makes for some frustrating game play. I don't mind the tornado, explosions in the middle of the road constantly levels, or roof top timed challenge modes existing.... if there was a choice to it. If i could choose to want to play that or not it would really help. I want a core gameply driven experience when I hit campaign, and I want a challenge type scenario placed elsewhere. My campaign should be an experience of improvement and difficulty to be the best racer out there, not dodging randomly generated falling cars.The game is still fun, but I am not recommending it until I see some real direction put into the game instead of a bunch of randomly placed together content and skill trees."

The level progression is somewhat questionable, with randomly generated missions, leaving you up to the same task, with different tracks. That being said it does add some variety to the table.For those of you, like me, that enjoyed the classic Road Rash game on Windows 95, this game is quite similar. I do hope they add certain elements like being able to choose out of a variety of bikes. At the moment you just click on the upgrade bike button as it stacks up with the XP you gained.There is also a skil tree system implemented in the game. Along with an upgrade system that, with some time and balancing, will perfect out your racing style.An excellent game with excellent early access potential.

Obviously it was a little short but in open access I expect little compromises. It's a very familiar pattern to Road Rash of old with level after level of wild tracks to race. It can be quite seat of the pants type stuff at times with clever dips and rises hiding oncoming traffic, crazy debris spinning about the track, suicidal cop cars etc etc etc. It has a great structure of purchase based add-ons and experience based ones to fine tune your rider for the oncoming challenges but could really use the same to customise and personalise your bike itself. At this time, it could definitely still do with some fine tuning (for example Road Rash's agonisingly long run back to the bike after crashing would add a greater price for recklessness) but all complaints are minimal to the joy you'll get watching a man you've just kicked into oncoming traffic get wiped out by a logging truck. If it was a bigger full game with competitive online multiplayer and the tweaks ironed out it'd be a certain 8 or 9 out of ten. Great work bringing back a sorely missed classic."

This game covers the cross-continental journey from the dazzling west coast to the seat of corruption.Along the way, the young man makes shocking discoveries. The most unsettling is the realization of his own innate violent desires. Unsure how to reconcile them with his noble mission, he lashes out at many bikers who are pursuing their own goals on the lonely roads. The entire time, he is haunted by a semi -- clearly a metaphor for his unstoppable ambition and the pain and destruction it leaves in its wake.

I have 250+ games on Steam and yet Road Redemption; a game that I grabbed on sale for under $20, seems to be the one I've kept coming back to lately. I think everyone already knows this game basically is Road Rash minus a few things like swinging chains and the ability to get knocked off your bike and have to run back and find it, get back on and join the race. The developers said they intentionally made it this way because it's a waste of time running to your bike and I tend to agree. As for chains I could easily see them adding them in the future. There are also some additions that I don't think were in Road Rash at all, like the Jump Jets. Some people say they are overpowered and overused and that may be true, but it doesn't really detract from the fun had with the game. I've thoroughly enjoyed being part of Early Access this time around since I'm able to see what the game was like at the start, sometimes you buy into early access, you load it up once and you say, ""Okay, I will get back to this game when there is something actually playable here"", but with Road Redemption there is just enough content to keep you coming back and they still have plans for a lot more.So this is basically Road Rash x10, everything is amplified...for example you can get fully automatic weapons and a grenade launcher. One you get the latter, it's pretty much game over for anything else on the road. I really can't recommend this game enough, even if you've never played Road Rash but you want a fun arcade-like motorcycle racing game.This game is CONSTANTLY being updated, I have a ton of respect for the developer(s), I've seen multiple patches on the weekend before. Out of the all my games I think it gets updated more than anything else. In fact, it's Monday, October 20th at 8am right now and there was a patch last night that improved the graphics, fixed one of the only bugs that annoyed me regarding music and many more things. These guys care about their game.Bottomline: If you played Road Rash, there is like 99% chance you will love this game. If you didn't play Road Rash, there is like a 98% chance you will love this game."

The models aren’t the best (especially the collision models); it’s poorly optimized, there are no key re-bindings… but above all, it’s still a blast to play. The level design is great, the combat system is like Road Rash on steroids, the weapon selection is massive ( who doesn’t love taking someone out with a claymore, mace, or harpoon gun?), and the developers actually care about feedback.

However that only existed for the evening, and the next morning I was able to start playing.Now I'm not a very good gamer, being honest, and this game offers a respectable challenge. But I've had so much fun already. I've only reached level 6 (not sure how many there are) and once you die,  you have to restart. However it's not as bad as it seems. After each successful level you get cash to spend on extra weapons, food and the like. Cash and purchased items only last until you die. When you die you get experience earned to spend on permanent upgrades. These include extra health, more weapon durablity/ammunition and extra lives etc. There's a decent sized tech tree to unlock. So each time you fail you're made a little stronger for the next attempt.If you've played Road Rash then you're familiar with the style of play; fast-action racing with lots of cars and other bikers, all kicking, punching and smacking each other over the road (and over cliffs as well) trying to win the race. There are also guns and explosions, cars flying everywhere, enemy police bikes/cars and other car racers fighting you, taxis on skyscraper rooves and I'm sure some of the ambient traffic tries to take you out too!The devs have named some of the enemy bikers after popular youtubers/streamers such as TotalBiscuit, Pewdiepie and Spoony, which I chuckled at.Now of course there are bugs (had one where I levitated at the side of a building after falling over the edge) and in general it lacks polish. The devs have promised a competitive multiplayer/pvp mode at launch, which should be fun... though I'll die instantly probably!All in all, you can replay the same few levels over n over and have a lot of fun. It's not a game you'll be able to play for thousands of hours unless you're really good at the pvp mode, but you'll certainly get your money's worth for just £14, and once completed, it'll be something I come back to every now and again for a quick blast of fun."

A seat that has been collecting dust for far too long IMHO. It also reminds me of the craziness of the Burnout series and Radikal Bikers. I tend to prefer racing games that are more than just racing. Sometimes its more satisfying to just blow it all up. I find this game to be a great way to get all my commuter frustrations out. I'll happily sacrifice realism for entertainment value.Minor stuff:The gameplay is pretty solid for an Early Access. Haven't run into any sort of game ending glitches or crashes.The Punk Model: the skin on his shoulders stretches all kinds of funny when he swings a weapon.I'm reluctantly happy there isn't a restart race/round option, far too many times I've had awful starts that resulted in a win where I was just trying to finish.Ballerina Effect: Every once in a while a car or piece of wood will start to spin out and, I guess, lose it's horizontal drag making it spin faster and faster. I kinda like the effect, it definitely has a place in a crazy game like this. It's a mechanic that jives with an icy track or low gravity but not every environment.Low Speed Turning: I tend to hit the fence on the Star Road from time to time. It usually spins me 180 degrees. I find it easier to select 'put me back on track' instead of attempting to turn around. The turning radius is wider than the track forcing me to make a 3 or 4 point turn just to get reoriented.Pipe Bomb Bikers: So satisfying to take these guys out. There's a good chance I'm probably just complaining here but in Campaign+ I've run out of time on take-down missions because the Pipe Bomb Bikers take out the other bikers before I can catch them. It isn't a recurring issue, usually happens if I'm out of Nitro.Campaign+: I found some of the races where there's car rain, bomb guys and car/truck opponents (usually around 10+) were easier to finish because the obstacles end up taking out all the competition in the duration of the race.Star Road: I found that if I rocket boost right at the sart of the race, before the first drop, I will sometimes fall through the track instead of landing.Some terrible suggestions:1) Selectable 10-speed bike: C'mon its a little funny.2) Female Racer: While Shovel Knight was the addition that made me buy the game, your welcome. I wouldn't be opposed to some sort of female character model.3) Grab Breaks: Opponents don't seem to break a grab no matter how long I hold them.4) Intersections: Pretty self explanatory.Thanks for this gem of a game.

If/when they add in online multiplayer (local-only right now), I think the value will increase.Compared to many Early Access games, it's fairly polished, but there's a lot that still needs work in the game.Some of the physics create dumb situations where you can get stuck, even with the jump jets. There's also the oddity of being able to steer while in mid-air - realism vs fun aside, this leads to an easier game than it should be.The menus are very primitive in appearance, and the UI sound effects could use a lot of work, as they break immersion. It's also non-intuitive to exit the game properly - you can't do it unless you're in a race that's going on, which should be allowed, but shouldn't be the only way!I'd love to see more progress in being able to buy/unlock new bikes/costumes, even be able to paint things the colors you'd like."

After a few levels, you will get to a race across rooftops where you can use your ""Jump Jets"" to boost over gaps between buildings. The problem is, if you happen to get the ""Eliminate X# of Rival Racers"" mission, this particular race is next to impossible due to the amount of time everyone spends in the air and the number of hairpin turns that prevent you from lining up attacks. This mission combo presents a ridiculously sudden spike in difficulty and effectively guarantees a Mission Fail.This is the aspect of the game that kills the fun in an otherwise good run.Since the game is in Early Access, there is still a lot of room for improvement and hope for some of these issues to be addressed, but for the moment, I would only recommend this game to fans of Road Rash, and only on sale for $15 or less."

This should be enough to tell you that you will not play much of the game.I didn't like it. Maybe I am just a little to young (20) to have played the games that were like this back in the day so I don't get the whole nastalgia feeling or anything, but if you want a throw back or enjoy the simple games where you just try to get further or try to get a higher score than last time... ok.Starting the game out, you get on your bike, you press forward and depending on situations... you never stop pressing W. Time your whacks right and you get a hit on a guy who then get some strange spead boost if he isn't dead in the first hit. Get a gun and shot your enemies... only takes one shot usually but the maps are just full of bends, there really arent any straight aways or anything, so you miss most of your shots.Graphics... not great. The models for the game were not made that well. They represent the object being displayed just fine but there should have been a lot more vertices for a game that is so simple. Map design... lots of cars on the road, and a few things on the side. That is all, nothing more than that, your done. Just stay on the road or suffer a large penalty to move speed off it.Respawns... I once ran into a car on accident and I respawned, only to be pancaked instantly (theres about 2/3 of my heal gone), respawned once more and got ran into from behind this time by a semi. Guess what? Game over, start over again with the same boring winding roads with the same weapons and maybe one more upgrade but probably not.So I guess since I come from a primarily FPS and MMO background, this kind of game was just never suited for me anyway. If your into games that are similar to this, then I'm sure you will enjoy it. But I don't like the boring grinds of the same thing over and over again. I enjoy challenges, but I like challenges that are different each time, this is just the same set of missions over and over until you get past the one you died at."

However this little gem of a game has come along and helped me rediscover a bit of gaming joy.There's a definite feeling of speed, and both the combat and dodging of obstacles can give that on-edge feeling where your breath stops for just a moment as you wait those milliseconds to see if you edged it.There's rightly a lot of comparisons to Road Rash, but this game stands out on its own merit. It has a whackyness that surpasses the prior game, and the feeling of progression is different as well, at least in this early access edition. Road rash felt more gradual, whereas this game throws you right into things. Said progression is a bit strange in Road Redemption, but it has its own charm if you have the patience.The game still needs work, there are some strange occurances and the odd crash, but the patches have been coming thick and fast and I am confident it will only get better.

Also the control of the bike is quite nasty. In my way it doesn't felt like the Roadrash game which was a game with a good pace of controlling a bike and could feel the moment of every thing, but here in Road Redemption it doesn't satisfy me of being such a game like the old one. Should make some fixes too for getting it a good pace, not very extreme. My search still continues for a game like Road-Rash."

The bones are good - solid controls, satisfying basic mechanics, and a nice feel to the whole thing. I just can't tell, from the game's present state, whether or not there's a bigger idea for a game here. As it stands now, you're really repeating the same three or four events over and over, and I sense they're trying to compensate for the skimpy content by making it harder to play than it should be.

There are bikes that race and you can knock each other off. That's about where the good stuff ends.Every bike feels floaty and weird; as in the physics just feel wrong. I often felt like I was flying or something - and in one level on roof tops that is literally the case. The combat which could have been really simply is needlessly convoluted, with randomized pickups; randomized starting weapons ranged weapons that are either over powered or utilize clunky aiming controls.... I hate the music. Just. Ugh - as someone who probably played a thousand hours of Road Rash on my crappy Sega I wanted to love this one really bad but everything about it feels like a let-down.I can't tell if its the nostalgia that ruined this one for me; or the game itself - but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. There are better standard racers; and as long as Blur still exists there are better combat racers. It could get better because early access; but I'm not hopeful. I may come back to it in a couple years and see if its any better. Until then I'd give this one a wide berth."

,Recommended,300380,13514795,"Posted: 21 December, 2014",all,toad_004,"This is the type of game that makes me question steam's binary review system - you either give thumbs up or thumbs down, neither of which conveys my feelings about this game. Then again, it's still an improvement from steam's old system, which didn't even have a ""no"" option at all!So, on to Road Redemption. This game is a spiritual successor to EA's Road Rash series of games, so the main game play consists of beating the crap out of your fellow bikers and trying to be the first to the finish line. But this isn't just a re-skin of road rash with modern graphics. Combat is effectively required, as some missions flat out require you to eliminate enough enemies to advance. But all the missions (save the pure time trials) require plenty of fighting. Taking down another racer will knock them out of the race, and taking down almost anyone will restore some health and nitro, as well as reward some money and their weapon.It's no surprise then, that the developers took care to make the fighting the single best part of the game. There's a lot of depth to the combat, from kicks and grabs to baseball bats and pistols. Kicks and grabs are good for steering someone into an oncoming car or forcing them off a cliff. Melee weapons vary in speed, strength, and durability - for instance, shovels are strong but slow, while bats are weaker but faster. Swords break easily but are both fast and strong. Then you have the guns, ranging from pistols to Uzis and grenade launchers. They are great for shooting other bikers from a distance. Finally, you can deflect an attack from an enemy - if done right it blocks the attack and makes your next attack very powerful.There are various missions and various conditions to preform them under. Most of these are fun, such as eliminataing a certain number of enemies, or attracting police attention. However, the 'time trial' missions lack the fun factor present in the other mission types. They are the only missions with no one to fight, and it seems that there's no reason for these missions to be here, other than ""a racing game needs time trials""! Many also cannot stand the 'car rain' missions, where cars literally rain down from the sky and crash into the ground. They'd be pretty fun if it wasn't for the pure randomness of it - it's possible for a car to land right in your way (or otherwise bounce or slide in your wary) with no chance to react, causing an instant crash and a loss of some health.Losing health is a big deal, because unlike in the road rash games where zero health meant losing a few positions, in Road Redemption it's an instant game over! This is the most drastic departure from the classics, where the only way to lose was inability to pay for your wrecked bike or a ticket form the cops. Death means starting back from square one, except for the skills you purchase with XP, which you get to retain between playthroughs. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the skills are fairly neat. But it may tick of long-time rashers who just wanted to relive the classics.The game's actual problem lies in it's lack of content. I was able to complete everything this game has to offer within 3.1 hours, according to steam. At present, the campaign is comprised of 12 levels with randomly generated missions, and there is a harder campaign+ which is the same, just harder. There is no story to speak of, and the only multiplayer is local split-screen co-op. This is what made the game so hard to recommenced - 3.1 hours does not justify the game's $19.99 price tag - even if it were 75% off, that's well over a dollar an hour! So why then, is there blue, rather than red, at the top of this review?My final recommendation arises not from what this game currently is, but from what it can be in the future. This game'sGreenlight pagegives a description of a story featuring multiple outcomes depending on your actions, as well as facing betrayal from your gang, and leading your own gang at some point later in the plot. This story mode alone would be worth the price if added to the already outstanding gameplay,  but the developer seems to be active in the forums and seems to express a desire to add plenty of other content, and already has added quite a bit since early access release. Based on what this game can become, I ultimately must recommend this game.I must make sure to revisit this review in the future once the game is completed, whenever that may be.UPDATE: Road Redemption has undergone an engine change. Historically, an engine change mid development results in classic games like Daikatana and Duke Nukem Forever. Thankfully, this game may be an exception to the rule.The boring time trial missions appear to have been removed entirely while the car rain missions (referred in-game as ""Hallucinogenic chemical zone"") have been altered so that cars are always avoidable. In addition, one new track was actually added to the gameGraphics were mildly improved with the engine change. I've been informed that performance has improved though I cannot confirm as my current PC is far over recommended specs. They've been able to add in more traffic and more racers as well - a welcome addition. Jump Jets now have a meter of their own, and only appear on the rooftop missions.The only downside to this change (or perhaps I simply missed this flaw before) is that unaligned traffic seems to target the player despite being supposedly unaligned."

My first review was extremely negative but not only was I contacted by the devs (like, through Steam chat directly) but they have made many of the changes both I and other critics suggested. The game has gone from Lunacy Racer, which it was originally, to something akin to Road Rash. And you know what? It is a lot of fun. It’s a great Early Access title that really does test your skill and shock you with bone-crunching crashes when that skill fails.It is still lacking a few elements including context for the missions (why are we trying to raise our Police Wanted Level) and store prices (why does a strip of beef jerky cost $500) but these 'flaws' can be excused as they are still developing the game. And make no mistake – they are developing it. It has come a long way since those early days.If you are interested in a very violent motorbike racing game full of shocking crashes and satisfying ‘skull-cracking’ combat, this is the game for you. It is A LOT of fun!"

A lot of carnage, and a lot of crashing (for everyone) for other people the game may work smoothly right now....but not everyone. Its a good game to support at this time tho.Edit #1: After 2-3 updates, the performance of the overall game has only improved slightly to the point where it starts off fine but then gets worse and worse. I have a high end gaming laptop that normally can handle games smoothly with no problems when others say they cant play properly, but not for this game. I dont know about anyone else though. Anyways.....the latest updates did come out with some new interesting content that does add on to the overall game, like new characters, weapons etc. They did state that there was some huge performance fixes but as i said.....i dont see them. because of the still current lag-fest i have not been able to get more then a total of 1 hour playing. But im sure more updates will come soon and i will try again for my second Edit of this review.Edit #2: We got another decent update with a few smaller ones before hand, and even tho they add to the campaign, i still can't play on any graphics settings higher then ""Fastest"".

Everything appears much sharper than before, and it feels a bit more like actually riding a motorcycle. The physics have been made more realistic as well, although there are a few hiccups at times when I'm pretty sure I pass straight through objects. More than anything, I just hope multiplayer gets added (I'd love to have co-op, cracking skulls on motorcycles with a friend?

It has all the feelings of classic Road Rash (this is coming from a Sega Genesis veteran who by the way was decently disturbed by the violence in the game when I was 4)......and this violence is understandably much worse in this modern day game (not in a bad way)... it has a decent amount of blood and a sort of disturbing sound effect when the melee weapon cracks against the body of an opponent. Yes it's disturbing, but it kind of puts a moral urgency on whether or not you want to violently and bloodily slam someone off of their bike and probably maim them for life. But I don't want to make it seem like the violence is overwhelming. It's just enough to be funny and in your face but not overdone.Immediately fun, easy controls, and it has an interesting old school game path where you progress through levels and if you die you have to start over. Kind of gives you more of an initiative to keep playing, I feel.Sure I've only played a half hour so I can't know for sure about replayability or longevity, but I'm sure when online multiplayer is released it will be a huge plus, not to mention local split screen co-op which I've also been scarcely pleased with on Steam for a year.Great game!"

It's great fun, and it'll be alot more fun when they get the multi-player working. (Local co-op/multiplayer specifically speaking.) The graphics are good, and play is good. I originally bought this thinking these gameplay modes must work since they included in the description, but they are NOT functional yet... which I wasn't happy about finding out after I spent the money wanting a 2 player experience like the old road rash days. DEVS... DON'T LIST FEATURES ON THE STORE PAGE THAT ARE YET NON EXISTENT IN YOUR PRODUCT !!  ...unless of course your trying to make people mad, then bravo, job well done.  If you do list them, then be specific that they are TO BE added. I couldn't even get a xbox controller to function without spending much time trying to bind controls with a 3rd party app, but fortunately, I'm well practiced at keyboard and mouse controls. Over all, it's still a work in progress, but so far, so good !  For single person play, I'd still recommend it."

The game is rather bland, the controls awkward, and just falls flat.You spend your time following a straight route with no choice. Your given missions to earn money, which is useless. none of the items are of any use. You cant upgrade your bike, buy weapons, or do any sort of worthwile upgrades. after you crash you lose all your cash and upgrades you bought and some of its converted to XP. Xp can be used to level up specials, that are only mildly useful. start with a slightly better weapon that will fall apart almost immediatly, tiny bit more health (you can now survive half a hit before getting knocked out!) or a small bit more nitro or other things that basicly played out as useless.each time i play this it just leaves me disappointed. there are things that can be fixed, but alot of it seems like it would involve a major remake of the game.

I can think of racing games that came outliterally twenty years agowith better music.Two, the controls. How about mouse controls? How about support for third-party USB controllers? How about at least toning down the keyboard controls so basic attempts at steering don't have me pinballng from one side of the track to the other?Third, on a similar point, the camera. I don't believe I've ever played a racing game with a free-floating camera before, and I don't see how it adds anything to the experience. It mostly serves to confuse the player because the vehicle rarely lines up with the view properly, and when Idomove the camera in a driving game,I expect the vehicle to steer towards the camera.It might be a better experience later on, but for now it's the most frustrating experience I've picked up from the recent Steam sale."

You pretty much start every mission with a weapon instead of having to earn it by grabbing one from an opponent so that old feeling of ""♥♥♥♥ YEAH I JUST GOT THE CHAIN!!!!"" is gone. You no longer have to run to your bike after you wreck which I'm not quite sure is a bad thing or not yet. So far it is feeling more like the crappy GBA version more than the awesome genesis/3DO versions of road rash.

The classic road rash games never had guns. it was melee only. I suggest being stingy with ammo in PVP. Even still there is an interesting balance hurdle here. If you steer with keyboard WASD, you'll have the typical non ideal stiff WASD driving controlls but the trade off is your fireaim Aim will be massively OP with the mouse... but if you use a controller, your steering will be better than the keyboard but the tradeoff is your Aim with guns will be awful via thumb stick aim @ PCmaster race keyboard+mouse=superior aim  @ controllers suck for aiming crosshairs in anyway shape or form.  I for 1 would much rather use a keyboard and mouse but steer poorly via WASD because the guns are just too good of a trade off. It's just much simpler to drive stiff with WASD but then blow everybody away with guns as opposed to trying to race them traditionally... and is that really the route they wanna go down in what's ultimately a driving game.. aim and shooting being more important than driving?

Pre-alpha or something. This game was advertised as ""Road Rash Reborn"" or something like that, but all i was able to see is ""Mario Kart with Bikes"". The game is very fun, i give you that. But the modeling is poor, the physics is poor. There's no bike selection and the maps although it's proceduraly generated, it bugs a lot. And personally, i don't like the car storm and neither the traffic in the rooftops.This is my temp review. I want to see (the said) improvements in the next update.My second review on 09 Oct @ 9:03pmA lot had improved since my first review. Stability, gameplay, etc. Nice to see the game acquiring it's form and getting polished.The producers also contacted me and really wanted to hear what i had to suggest. It was very thoughtful. I gave a lot of feedback and hope to have helped them. :)"

This feels like Road Rash - truly. And if you're too young to remember the original, let me explain what that means: Intuitive, easy-to-pickup motorcycle racing controls mixed with ridiculously entertaining violence.Is another racer pulling up next to you, about to hit you in the face with a baseball bat? Kick him into oncoming traffic. It feels good. It feels real good.Melee weapons are here, of course, but the addition of guns and explosives make for a novel twist to the old formula. And most importantly, I like the way the guns feel.It doesn't feel impossible to aim while driving; The skill came rather quickly, honestly. Automatic weapons are great for taking out small packs of enemy racers, while single-shot weapons make picking off one at a time - even from a distance - possible, and satisfying.I have almost 700 games right now, not counting free-to-plays, and this is the one I keep going back to when I have a half an hour to kill.Buy the game. Buy it. It's $20 bucks while it's in ""Early Access,"" and it's already worth twice as much - so after it's done and they raise the price, it'll still easily be worth the money.Buy it.

I was hoping you could buy and upgrade your bike etc but as of now all you can do is buy character upgrades that allow you to do more damage and get more ammo etc. Another thing i dont really like is having guns in the game. It makes the game play too easy. Id perfer melee-only similar to Road Rash. Also i hope there are more in depth NPCs and gangs to interact with...and multiplayer(which is coming).

By playing or rather trying to play this game for roughly an hour, I spent the better part of that hour frustratingly trying to get my pc gamepad to work with it and even with using the input settings, some of which i'll admit were rather frustrating, in the end did not work.Searching for an answer via the internet I have discovered that an xbox360 controller works just fine on the PC, however I don't have an XBOX360 controller and simply refuse to buy one either. One gamepad for each and every game should work, PERIOD. Not just a specific one.In the end I tried playing with a keyboard and mouse and had limited success, controls are laggy and sometimes the screen freezes when an enemy is killed. It's also rather difficult to make hard or sharp turns when the bike itself even at the very 1st level seems rather sluggish and feels like I need to turn my own body to will it to go left and right.In hindsight, the game reacts and moves just like the old road rash games in that retrospect if you wanted a bit of frustrating nostalga,  however I was hoping for a smoother and better gaming experience that actually and equally goes with the change in the times and of gaming.There is also quite a delayed effect with trying to take the enemies down with weapons, infact its increasingly frustrating, because when you click the left or right mouse button, you expect an immediate reaction, but much like the steering and general incompetance of the game, it too is increasingly slow and delayed.So all in all? Doesn't work with any gamepad except an x360 controller, laggy and slow on turns and attacking, even more frustrating and difficult to play on your keyboard/mouse and quite frankly isn't worth the £15 I spent for it on steam.Yes it looked amazing via youtube and the gamers that reviewed it gave it major props but I still can't help but feel like I've been decieved. Still regardless of my 1st hr impressions of it, no matter how negative they maybe, I'm not going to completely give up on it until I've given it more time, maybe try tweeking it a bit. Till then?

Instead, it kind of never went anywhere. Those games died on the side of some infinite stretch of desolate highway in the late ‘90s. Luckily, the people at DarkSeas flipped open their Necronomicon and decided to revive the genre with Road Redemption and I couldn’t be happier. It’s at least ten times the skull busting, engine revving, cap popping, and jump jetting you can remember.Set in a world where cars can, and occasionally will, rain from the sky, this is the Road Rashiest rehash you could possibly envision. Calling it a tribute doesn’t even do it justice. Road Redemption does more for this niche racing genre than any game before it. It’s nearly perfect and, technically, not even a finished product. Part roguelike, part RPG, and all high-octane violence, this game is both incredibly easy to get into and difficult to perfect. Careen across skyscrapers and swerve around crumbled competition – there are a ton of surprises folded into this title. Pure entertainment and a “must own” for old-school fans."

Reviving the epic Road Rash is a great idea, but for people like me who are nostalgic to the childhood memory may feel a bit disappointed. As long as I remember, one of the best thing about Road Rash is the unlimited freedom it gives to the player, e.g. you can simply drop you motor and run all the way the finish line, however the freedom is absent from Road Redemption.First the new game runs in a much faster pace with much shorter tracks, which leaves the players busily doging coming veichles and runs like hell to the finish line, no time is left for more fun. Secondly the player dies far too easily: either you get hit by a car coming into your face (waaaay too much traffic!), or a car dropped randomly from the sky, or simply got slashed by a axe two times. I would still stick to the idea that you could pick up your bike and ride on when you got seriously damaged. Then it is the optimization issue. The game is supposed to be affordable even for mid tier laptops, but with a brand new MSI with a GeForce 970M GPU I still experience some significant PFS drop. Finally, is it really neccessary to have some troll events like Hallucinogen*****, or to let the player compete with a car? I have already have Goat Simulator so I truly don't need another game just like that, especially for a game that I wish I could invest more time in.For the pros, the game has some really good level designs, for which I mean level 4 where you can compete on the rooftop with a jet pack on your rear wheel. I did not get to all the campaign levels but I believe there will be more surprise to come.To note that this is an alpha version so there is still a lot that can be improved. With a fantastic initial concept I am hoping for future updates. So with my expectation high on this I will give it a yes."

The physics of the bike in the air is ridiculous... but then again so is the whole idea of the game. There is some satisfaction to be had in planting a bomb on a rival gang member's bike or grappling them until they are hit by an on-coming car. Then there's the 'cars raining from the sky' which isn't a bug but an actual developers' choice for a thing to be happening while you are trying to dodge cars and bikers.The biggest issue at the moment on my system is that the game crashes out when trying to load levels. This appears to be due to the game using up all available memory and can be delayed by setting it at the the graphics to 'fastest'. The developers are aware of this and are trying to sort it out.As this game has no plot it can be very satisfying to just jump in a race, smash of few bikers down and then walk away. The weapons have different characteristics and learning to time the strikes is interesting.I wouldn't say the game is worth $20 in its current state but, with the effort being put in to fix the errors, I would say that it will be."

The rooftop levels are sometimes a little overkill (i.e., I'd rather race and beat up other racers than worry about grappling around like Spiderman), but overall a fun game, and most of the levels and challenges are engaging and entertaining. In my experience, playing with a controller is MUCH better than with keyboard, which is a swich, since I'm normally a keyboard & mouse gamer. However, the responsiveness in turning and braking seems easier to control via controller. Ultimately, I think it's been worth the purchase and I'm looking forward to seeing the finished results of the completed game (currently playing in Early Access)."

I loved Road Rash back in the day owning every version there was across the mega drive, 3do and PS1. I still think it is a disgrace the game was killed by EA and never saw a remake or sequel, a real missed opportunity, guess they can’t see past their endless versions of Fifa etc.However, I am very pleased to report that road redemption captures that road rash magic and brings it into the modern world with aplomb. The racing is fast and fun with busy roads making just finishing alive a real challenge. Though it makes the game initially VERY difficult, the one life system does make the game more tense and challenging, adding a necessary sense of danger and a very real failure state. The combat is great fun and feels weighty and satisfying and it is addictive chaining kills and trying out all the different weapons. The guns are very good too but it is a bit disorientating when the camera moves with aiming, at least you can re-centre it (press right stick). And the C4 is just pure genius, that stuff never gets old!However, whilst I adore this game already and think the developers are doing a great job, I do think the game still needs some work to be ready for release and there were a few things that puzzled me and things that just didn’t seem quite right, both in terms of design and the actual game engine.The first ‘issue’ struck me quite early, I was driving alongside a police bike and hit a car and came off my bike, right I thought I’m ‘busted’ (as in road rash) but absolutely nothing happened, the police bike just went by. After extended play I realised the police bikes appear to be a different character and bike skin and nothing more. This is a huge missed opportunity IMO as the constant threat of being busted if you come off your bike was a major gameplay hook in road rash and could be here too.Another thing, which isn’t a fault as such, but just felt weird compared to road rash was having cars (and sometimes even trucks etc) take part in the race. It just doesn’t seem a fair match and the way the cars in the race tend to slide from one side of the track to the other is distracting and just looks weird. I know the game is going for the arcade vibe but you can go too wildly unrealistic too, the cars shouldn’t be able to move like the bikes, they are much bigger and heavier.There is sometimes just too much going on, too much carnage, too many cars, bikes, riders etc flying around. When these moments of pure carnage happened (particularly on the car rain tracks and the ones with explosives on the track) it kills performance (even on a pretty good PC) turning the game into a slideshow and making survival partly dependant on luck, which IMO is wrong, in a racing game like this it should always be skill, not luck that gets you through. Don’t get me wrong, avoiding a car landing on your head or some C4 is great fun, I’m not saying get rid of the car rain/explosives type levels, just make them a bit less frequent (or reduce their intensity a touch) and make the core (racing/brawling) gameplay the game’s main focus.  I’m just saying scale the whole destruction and wackiness thing back a bit, because the game doesn’t really need it, it can be enjoyable (and sometimes best) without it, road rash never had those things going on and never needed them either, the core mechanics of racing coupled with fighting is engaging enough.The graphics are really impressive, especially for an early access title but there does seem to a bit of a lack of variety in scenery and locales (the rooftop tracks seem worst for this). Hopefully, the final release will see some more track types, the city levels in road rash with pedestrians, heavy traffic and tighter inner city roads were great and a nice green countryside type track with rolling fields and hills would really enhance the experience too.As enjoyable as the career mode is, it currently is a bit short and lacks a real sense of progression from one event to the next, they get harder sure but with road rash the races actually got (much) longer too so aspects of survival (vs getting into a lot of fights) and trying not to come off the bike really started to play a part. I’d really like to see the races/events become bigger and longer as you move through the career mode giving the player a real sense of progression.Lastly, in technical terms the game is superb for early access, no outright crashes at all. A few occasions on the roof top events when riding between the two buildings I fell down the middle of them, the game didn’t put me on the track (I was just stuck ‘in’ the building) using the option to reset back to track was tried several times but each time it just put me back in the middle of the gap between the buildings and I fell to my doom over and over until I ran out of energy. This only happened a few times but made me extra careful to time my jumps right!Overall, sorry if this seems a negative review as I think the game is great already and seeing a road rash homage is a personal dream come true. I would recommend it highly as it is right now, I just really want to see the final release be as good as it possibly can be."

I know this game is not Road Rash, but with the simularities, I assume they were headed for the same direction.  However, after palying this for a little while all it did was make me miss Road Rash.  So I'll do my review of the pros and cons:Pros:-Fun in it's own unique way as some moments from Road Rash are relived-Traffic is certainly more active and makes for a fun ride-Guns are an interesting, nice additionCons:-The gameplay is too fast. You go all out in seconds and are forced to adapt to a very fast pace.  You get used to it after a awhile...sorta-Riders spawn ahead of you.  You don't ride with a set group racing towards the finish (though there are some that remain...) but it's not as enjoyable when random riders keep coming (in my opinion)-Not that many enviromental elements that you can explore.  Road Rash would have interesting little obsticles to ramp and get weapons or whatnot.  This version has you follow a road.  That's it. Sometimes adding a ramp in the road...but it's not as interesting (even the roof top levels aren't all that fun)Altogether, I'm excited about the direction the game is taking and it's an early release so there is more to come...but I still prefer Road Rash 64 over this (thus far anyways).  I'd love it if someone remade Road Rash 64 with updated graphics and traffic.  This is not that game. Yet."

First boot, I almost think it's crashed, but finally the menu decides to show up for work. Dress code must be pretty lax here, as the UI looks like a placeholder. Probably is the case, as the Keybindings button is blanked and unusable. The background environments take me back to PS2 days, but it's Fastest graphics quality. Alright, no big deal, let's do this.Campaign supports 4 players locally, neat. I'll come to wonder how, eventually. 5 bikes, 2 of which look about the same in stats and looks. Shovel Knight character looks cool, let's go. OH GOD. Loading screen visuals make me think this is a mod, and the mission starts with no notice. No countdown to go, not even a quick overview of the controls and mechanics. Maybe it's supposed to be old-school, and you're supposed to read the manual? It's easy enough to play I guess, but WOW that framerate is schizophrenic. 1280x720 resolution, Fastest Quality, and a computer above Recommended specs, and I'm lucky to break 50 frames per second. Controls are a mess when frames are dropping and flying between 20 and 40 fps, and packed races can bring it to a halt. Trying to quit to play something else, it tops it all off with a crash to desktop, losing any XP progression I had. I gave it some extra time later, to see if things were a fluke. No changes, other than no other crashes. Maybe I came in after a bad patch, but it sounds like I'm not alone with issues on the forums.Aside from optimization and bugs, I'm really not impressed with the gameplay. Maybe there is more depth to the combat I haven't found, but I did alright just by attacking, moving aside so I never needed to deflect. Missions get pretty repetitive, along with the lifeless desert roads. The progression system is mostly stats, and nothing interesting, just a way to make the game harder until you grind more. I really haven't enjoyed the game to justify the $8 USD I spent on the sale, and I would be very disappointed at full price. Honestly, I don't think the game is ready to launch this year, unless the developers really go into overdrive before the end of the year. It has good potential, but the performance issues really held me back. Maybe it's just a small unlucky group having issues, but I really would've appreciated a demo to see how good/bad it ran for me.I jumped on the sale, expecting the game would easily be worth under $10 USD. Unfortunately I was mistaken. I should've looked at playtimes of more reviews, I think 16 hours is the most I've seen, and most people stop in a few hours. It's not nearly ready for launch, and the performance issues may mean you won't be able to enjoy the game properly. Check out videos to see if there is enough content for you to enjoy, and be careful. I've learned to treat Early Access games as effectively finalized, as you never know when progress will stop. I expect performance issues to improve, but I'm not certain all issues in the game will be fixed. More bikes/rider skins is NOT the solution."

When is the last time you almost threw your controller - while laughling ?It's a game in which the sheer randomness it creates frequently results in unbelievably intense, or humorous (or both) moments.  Yeah, it's got some things I'm sure that motorcycle driving purists won't like (you can steer and accel/decel-erate in mid-air, for instance), and some gui weirdness (sometimes your opponents somehow end up being cars - and sometimes you can outrun the placement of cars and bike npc's, for instance) -- but if you don't expect perfection, this game has pure old school edge of your seat bash-n-dash down to a T.  The maps are fun, and frankly I still can't keep any but the starter bike on the road...As-is currently in early access, the content is somewhat limited but is very replayable - I sincerely hope this ends up being completed and released to the masses, we deserve this game.

I discovered this because my push to talk button on teamspeak is the same as the grapple button.-You can easily exploit the ""place me on track"" button as it only removes your health and doesnt make you wait for the 5 seconds that crashing normally would. I think this button should emulate you crashing your bike instead.-General optimization issues, I get the same framerate on lowest graphics that I do on highest.-When starting the game with the music turned all the way down, some strange piano song plays and then suddenly cuts out.-Additionally, when starting the game it gets stuck on a light blue screen (similar to the color you see on the background of the unity logo), maybe this could be changed to show a loading image instead?-When switching out weapons at the beginning of the mission, it would be useful to see the durability of my current weapons.-Having a borderless windowed mode would be neat-The road is too visually flat, you can tell by the specularity from the sun-I think that there should be a bit of a minimap, similar to what you already get when racing, on all modes so you can tell whether you should back up or keep going if your goal is to kill cops/bikers.-When I saw the word ""procedural"", I imagined endless races that would randomly change, which I didn't get. Not too bad, but an endurance mode would be interesting with impromptu races and objectives.-Additionally with the procedural stuff, I feel theres not enough variation with each ""biome"".

If you are a fan of the Road Rash games, then this is for you.There were a few concerns when i started playing, like the addition of guns. You'd think theyd be highly overpowered amd overused, but it's actually quite balanced. Try aiming the camera sideways and not driving into a car or off a cliff. Even at distance, it's difficult to get a shot further than maybe 40 ft. There's also a rather unique Harpoon gun that can be used to spear opponents or, if you're crafty, launch it into a wall or the ground to slingshot yourself. Think Spiderman on rooftop levels.One bit of frustration I came across were some of the bugs. There was one in particular where, if you hit something while turning at high speed, it would just turn you in the wrong direction. In a race/ timed event, that's devastating. There is another where, when striking an opponent, your weapon simply passes through without damaging. The last one I can think of tends to happen on the rooftop races. Your bike will slow or stop the moment it's about to go airborne, or as it lands.Overall this is a lot of fun to play. The campaign mode is short at 12 levels, but it's harder than it looks to make it to the end. There are few level backdrops at, I think, 4. I look forward to seeing more out of this and maybe another couple of modes added on."

The racing is a nothing, the front end is ugly as sin, the game design is an attempt to marry per-game style shopping for bonuses with modern indie roguelike persistent levelling buys. I don't think that element will work well in the long run but this isn't a game you play because it is a piece of solid design. You play right now for the wonderfully realized brutal fun of clubbing other bikers.It's ugly, it's wonky, not everything fits together right and may never will, but dangit, they got the feel of motorcycle racing violence right.

,Recommended,300380,12371143,"Posted: 4 October, 2014",all,birdvsworm,"So this game is just in early access, but I have some great things to say about it.Things that work well:The actual combat. Road Rash always felt a bit sluggish, and given its' timing, rightly so. Road Redemption, however, feels really satisfying to play. The controller controls are a little awkward but take almost no time to warm up to - think ~3 hour learning curve, tops. The collision physics are also awesome. The maps, though fairly basic so far, offer some really great variety.Things that suck:The ragdolls need some help, but at least they have some (the developers could have probably left them out for now and gotten a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥ so at least they added some). The jump physics are pretty awkward - you can spin your guy left and right, more or less totally free, but you can't tilt vertically (think in GTA games, you can't go off a jump expecting to stay straight, so you turn your car/motorcycle to compensate landing). The weapon variety could be a bit better - shooting while driving is tough. The ""drift"" or ""accurate turn"" left-trigger is also kinda odd. It doesn't really brake the bike, it just slows it and lets you turn sharply. I know obviously a game all about beating dudes up on other bikes isn't going to focus on realism, but the driving should feel natural. As it is now, it feels a little off - not terribly so but just kinda odd. The grappling hook is ♥♥♥♥ed on those roof maps, I can't use it well for the life of me.Get this game if you liked Road Rash, or if you think this♥♥♥♥♥♥looks interesting.

Little things like holding back to do a wheelie and jump cars would really round out the feel of this game. However, the game truely shines when it comes to campaign advancement. You earn cash for races and spend it on upgrades for your current life. You earn XP that can only be spent after you die on permanent upgrades. Each race is a random objective, random environment status and random course. Ultimately you are trying to reach the final race without losing all your health. Combined this feels like a racing game I can keep coming back to for as many hours as I put in to FTL.What I still want: More polish (graphics and performance.)

I'm not really sure why.You must ""take down the bosses"", like some rebellious 1980's youth without a reason to do so.You must ""Race other gang members to the finish"".You must avoid cars flying from the sky, and be sure to smash other (unaffiliated?) riders faces in with a range of weapons I thought unlikely to see again since Postal 2.Why am I not recommending this game?Two reasons - It runs like a donkey pretending to be a goat.annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd the story didn't grip me.(The story? yeah....You know the one I've just described above....yeah, that one.)Even the reason/s to keep playing are sparse, there's no real progression to speak of, and I kind of wish there was.

The game has some similarities to Road Rash but has a lot of unique featuers as well, such as vertical jump jets on your bikes in the city rooftop level, and a Just Cause 2 style hook shot thing. The game is also somewhat Roguelike-ish in how it plays, with perma death on your rider, but also letting you upgrade your character for the next attempt.I've played it before and loaded it up again after multiple updates and found the game is even better than I remember. The graphics are great and with updates the performance issues are greatly improved. The music is fantastic and gets you pumped for kicking♥♥♥♥♥on the streets, and the sound effects have been improved and are even better now.Oh yeah, you can race as Shovel Knight now, awesome!Great variety of weapons, melee as well as guns & even C4. The guns are a little hard to control while trying to maintain your place on the road and not wipe out in a corner or on some moron driving their car into you, hopefully things improve on the guns and aiming. I'm not really worried though, because every time I go back to play this it has been updated and is even better than before.Still waiting on the multiplayer, and I think that will be incredible when it comes in.The game itself is fun to play and even has up to 4 player local co-op, but the campaign still feels a bit lacking. I'm not sure what it is, but it needs something to tie the races together, a story or something.You are racing and it's great fun, but you don't really know why you are racing, and the levels - while being fun - don't segway into each other and feel like instead of doing a campaign you have to do 10 random levels then do the last level. I am certain this will be address in the final version, and it is still in early access, so we'll just have to wait and see.All that said, this game is awesome. If you liked Road Rash, and you also like Roguelike games, this is a gooder!If you're not into early access, than definitely come back and check it out after the full release.http://youtu.be/uP5QhklnoWs"

The similarities between this game and the old road rash games ends there. If you're looking for an actual modern road rash this is probably not your game, if you just want to hit people with things while riding a motorcycle you may like it.Performance is bad.Controls are not very good.The sound and music levels are off. Sound track doesn't really work with the gameplay. Sound effects sound like canned effects you could get for cheap off the net.Level design is bad to horrible. Why is there traffic driving on roofs going off the ledges like lemmings?, why make a grappling hook level when it's not interesting to use or fun. In some levels both lanes are head on traffic. What's with the tornado level, the level barely looks changed and all the level accomplishes is showing off how unoptomized the game is and creates frustrating no win situations. Are the random bombs in some levels adding that much to the game? It seems like a lot of stuff has been thrown in to be like ""look how crazy we are!!"".The core racing portion of the game is unsatisfying, it seems this game is more about hitting people with weapons.Enemies go from your standard motorcycle games to armored humvees.

The starting areas are ugly and you start out with mostly combat, hardly racing at all. After an hour or so the environments get prettier and you can actually do some 'racing'.It's not exactly Road Rash either (I've got the Genesis version right here, and still play it), and the Kickstarter backers assuring you of that (and voting this down) are full of crap.  There's not enough racing for that, too much combat.Good stuff: The soundtrack is great. The combat is meaty and it's quite satisfying to take someone out. I do like the weapons (C4, boom!). The mission structure is interesting - it's basically a roguelike where you gain money from stage to stage and buy upgrades, but lose that all when you die. But then you can use your earned XP on permanent upgrades.  It gets prettier and less 100% combat after an hour or two.Biggest issues left: As noted, the first hour is crap and this needs a much better out of box experience. The physics are wonky as hell, pure 90s, which is fine for Road Rash, but then they pair it with a rooftop level that sticks bamboo slivers under the fingers of the wonky physics.Also, the steering is still far too tuned for combat. You can't go off the road unless you're not paying attention, which makes the driving bit kind of boring.BUT The devs seem to have fixed the worst thing, which was a 180 degree camera rotation if you used the fast turn.  I'd switch from No to Neutral if Steam would let me. And I haven't asked for a refund yet."

The whole thing is just smacking someone with a pole. You don't really feel like your racing until a box pops up and just tells you what place you got. There's no finish line. Trying to kick someone online is about impossible. It takes forever. The game moves so fast that by the time you♥♥♥♥♥♥your leg back, the other person has moved. Using weapons is about impossible as it turns the whole camera and now you aren't facing forwards anymore and it makes missing cars very difficult. Graphically the game isn't very good but seems to be pretty demanding. I can play games like GOW4, Titanfall 2 and Forza maxed out in 4k but have to turn this down to 1440p for it to be smooth.

The menu's and artwork are really bad they look like original doom/wolfenstein era menus only much less proffessional.

Love Road Rash and so I was really looking forward to this game. There are great bones here. The strength of Road Redemption (in its current state) is in the gameplay itself. The riding and fighting are solid. I would like to see the overall game modeled more after the N64 Road Rash but it is still fun. There needs to be rivals and biker gang issues. Earning small amounts of cash and slowly upgrading weapons/bikes. Keep hit damage lower to encourage more and longer battles. Road Redemption is at its best when you are flying down highways, making turns and battling. Overall this is a great start to a full version. If you aren't a fan of Road Rash then this alpha probably isn't for you.Just adding to my review since my old one is from so long ago. Much of my initial review still rings true today.Bottom line is probably still the same. If you have extra cash and really enjoy motorcycle combat then you won't be disappointed. If you are on the fence I wouldn't buy it in its current state. I am going to stick with recommend for now but unless significant strides are made before a final release I will probably switch to not recommend.I can't remember the last time I had such mixed emotions about a video game. On one hand the riding and combat is pretty solid. Graphics are good. I think the frustrating thing is the lack of direction. Is this supposed to be a burnout style arcade game with lots of boosting and takedowns? Is it a more classic road rash based on racing and more of a simulation style? (I understand simulation of racing motorcycles while fighting sounds ridiculous but you know what I mean). The heavier bikes and less control in the air suggest sim. The decapitations and jump jets suggest arcade. It just seems to ride this akward line between the two. What is the long term hook? There is a good short term hook in that you won't beat the game initially and you want to get in one more run, make some progress, and get some upgrades. Just seems like there should be higher levels of difficulty you progress through like old road rash games that you could meld with the XP skill tree stuff. Get money, buy better (and faster) bikes and weapons which propels you through the lower levels, keep grinding. The game becomes more difficult with tougher AI and the natural difficulty that comes with racing at higher speeds. This is my number one complaint (along with chemical zones and even worse bombs being dropped in the middle of the road). I would like to see a long play game with save points instead of the current you died start over with you upgrades system.After the update my progress was wiped, which I had hoped for. I played a few nights and had beaten both the regular and campaign + modes. It was definitely less than 10 hours. Hadn't filled the skill tree out much. It was like 4 or 5 runs through and one of them I bombed out pretty early. Levels 3 through 10 or so is where the game really plays the best to me. Mostly hand to hand combat and lighter guns. Overall I think a lot of good things were done in the update but I just don't see this game being where I had hoped in the near future. If this were an earlier build and you had more time to flesh out a deep campaign I would be extremely excited for this game. When are you planning on calling this a complete full game? The end of the summer? There has been a lot of improvement from gameplay to levels to AI. Almost every facet has gotten better but I feel like at the end of this I am going to say it was a pretty decent little game that could have been great.That all said I spent $15 or $20 or something and have had quite a bit of fun. I have logged 23 hours according to steam. I have been waiting since road rash 64 for a respectable motorcycle combat game and that someone finally tried makes me happy. Just the fact you guys are doing what you want and making a video game is awesome. The multiplayer will definitely add something to the total package and I am sure I am not done playing road redemption. Just wanted to offer my honest opinion on the game so far. Wish you guys nothing but the best on this and any future games.*UPDATE*Just wanted to update my review. I am changing my review back to recommend. For the cheap price this is really a pretty solid game and I have definitely gotten my money worth over the last couple of years. Solid progress has been made. Looking forward to the actual release of the full game"

At the time I appreciated that the game was very Early Access and could not recommend it.So what has changed?Well, in my original review I mentioned that there was no option for a quick race and at the time the game was distinctly lacking in certain areas. This now brings us to today's Early Access review. The game is still in Early Access state but has had significant updates from the developer. Included now is a Quick Race mode which is truly a welcome feature as many gamers would just like to have a couple of short blasts. I don't understand why every game these days just has to have a progression system but this game restricts it to the campaign mode only and I don't find it a grind like in many other games.With regards to the overall gameplay; Road Redemption is very much it's own game. It certainly is not a spiritual successor to the classic Road Rash games and if, like I, you puurchase this game with the sole purpose of replicating that experience then you will be disappointed.This game plays like a Mad Max on motorcycles. Pick your ride and lay wate in a post apocalyptic world of sorts. It is very much it's own game and needs to be appreciated that way.The inclusion of full 4 player local split screen is a very welcome addition, this is a game that cries out to be played with friends and I am hoping for online multiplayer to become a feature very soon.I must say that the devs have been very active in the community and I have had numerous messages exchanged with them regarding this game. This gives me a lot of encouragement that the game will be out of Early Access very soon and I am changing my original review from a negative to a positive."

I'm more going to review the update than the game as a whole.Pros- Handling much improved- Combat feels more smooth and responsive than it has in the past- Music and sounds are getting better.- Visuals have improved marginally- I like the stage setup more and the little bit of voice acting gives more personality- The nitro is significantly improved. It's actually useful now.- Ability to keep more weapons is a plus.- Using the Critical hit on kicks is soooo satisfying.Cons-F*ck the F*cking God**amn hallucinagen zones.-I still hate guns in the game. It just doesn't add anything fun to the gameplay.-I'd almost like another way to trigger the nitro. Everytime I feather the gas into a corner, I go flying.Overall, I'm happily changing from Thumbs down to up. There's still room for improvement, but it's a huge step in the right direction. More bikes to choose from would be neat. Any sort of customization would add some depth. Having some allies instead of just neutral would make a player feel like they're in a gang too and not just solo."

76561198049808122,Recommended,300380,18126582,"Posted: 20 September, 2015",all,Spaziroth,"Road Redemption is an adrenaline fueled, Road Rash inspired, high octane smash fest of brutal speed and even more brutal mechanics. However, it is still plauged by bugs that will frustrate you to the point that you want to reach through the screen, grab that pipe, and smash your computer over and over.First of all, to get it out of the way--If you're looking for a modern Road Rash game, this is it.At least, this is as close as you're going to get. Now that that's out of the way...Basic Overview and Rogue-like SynopsisRoad Redemption picks up the ever popular ""rogue-like"" genre and attempts to cross-breed it with another genre like so many others have done before. In this aspect, I feel it succeeds for the most part. You have cash to spend on upgrades between levels while you're still alive, but these upgrades and your cash all join you in the dust the moment you die. Fear not, as you then get to make permanent upgrades based upon the XP you've received during your adventure. This is calculated by how many levels you've completed and how much money you had on you when you made that final mistake.GameplayThe controls are tight and smooth, giving you the exact reaction when you need it most. There is a plethora of weapons available to you. You have three weapon slots and you always start off with at least a single bone-crushing instrument or gun. Upgrades can make these stronger as well as allow you to start each new game with better and better weapons. You get more weapons by defeating opponents, and occasionally a choice of one of three at the beginning of a level. Only three weapon slots though, so sometimes you'll be juggling replacing that half broken pipe wrench for a giggle-inducing time bomb while still keeping your eyes on the road and the action. The racing is smoothed and only occasionally suffers slow down (especially after the most recent update. I hardly see it at all anymore, thanks guys!).GraphicsThe graphics are nice (especially for a game made in Unity) but nothing to write home about. For the most part you'll be seeing the same old randomly generated desert plains with two different types of bridges. Stay alive, and you get to see some more variety, but not much. However, I personally spent more time concentrating on the road, the other drivers, and my inventory to really care that much.MusicThe music is... a rough spot for the game. It's not that it isn't good (it is), but that it's all over the board. Only a couple of the tracks really seem to capture the feel of the game, while the rest are just kind of... there. The primary menu screen is the worst offender here. It's a light, nostalgic, rainy day sort of piano tune that makes me think more of a casual RPG than a fast-paced motorcycle slaughter-fest.StoryThere is no story. Period. Now on here, in the description, you're given a basic story premise. But it is not apparent anywhere in the game except for the very end. You are racing and fighting just for the sake of it until then, but really, that's what you bought the game for, so who cares?Bugs and Balancing IssuesThen... there are the frustrating game-killers. Some of you (like myself) will see past these and continue to pick up and play an addicting titles. Others will be quickly put off. Collision damage isn't consistent. I can barely graze a car in the same side of traffic and be sent hurdling face first into the dirt. Likewise, I can be flooring it and hit an oncoming at full speed but miraculously just sort of ""bounce off"" its front fender without taking the slightest bit of damage.This problem also leads to my personally most frustrating bug. So sometimes when you hit an oncoming car dead on at full speed, rather than crashing, you get plowed along helplessly until the car crashes or something hits you to dislodge you. Ever want to feel like a bug in a front fender? Now you can! Seems ridiculous that it still hasn't been fixed. Its hard enough to catch up to anyone, let alone the top spot, once you've crashed. But now you're being dragged against your will and not amount of gas pushing, or smashing the other car will change this.The only other ""bug"" worth mentioning may actually be a part of the game's design. If the enemy is barely in front of you, they will be able to strike you, but you won't be able to hit them. They can cave in your skull, and even the block/parry button is useless to prevent it from happening.Some of the game is definitely skewed in the computer's favor. Semi trucks that can literally smash through anything and take quite a beating to destroy appear quite often as a fellow racer. Sometimes there are more than one of them. Humvees that can spew out mines that you never quite see in time. First place racers who gain that position and hold it eternally as if the Gods themselves had pre-determined no one else was worthy of taking home the gold. Unrelenting cop cars that are far more interested in you than your malicious motorcycle mates. Almost all enemies that are not a direct part of the race will stop what they're doing to someone else in order to match your speed and give you the hazing of a lifetime. Who paid these guys off?Final Score - 6.5/10I still recommend this to anyone who ever loved Road Rash, but with the warning that you will get frustrated by unfair mechanics, controller throwing bugs, and the occasional kick off a bridge. Get past these and there's a worthwhile game here. Certainly not worth the $10-15 mark-up they plan on completetion. Arguable whether it's worth the full $20 they're already charging. Pick it up on sale and you won't regret it though."

Repetition required until bike is worthy to enter tougher events.3. Battle with other racers and police for positions. Included occasional road rage motorist hit by your weapons or grazed by bike.4. More realistic non random roads/tracks and bike mechanics.Additional content or non campaign can feature the current game modes random tracks and all. With vast improvement to sound effects.

Im not saying the game is perfect in its current state and that it doesn't have its flaws, but I'm not gonna bother pointing it out since its clear to me that the developers are working hard on their game and that they care for the final product.The way I see it. The point of Road Redemption is to depict the most critical moments of every bike event (be it a ""race"", take out bikers, attract the police, etc), where tension and danger have build up to their highest.If you consider that and keep that in mind, than this game delivers it very well. Its very action packed and keeps you at the edge of your seat 99% of the time (even that not being the ideal for me, personally, but that is a matter of taste).I think its fair to see people disapointed with this game because they expected a Road Rash remake, and you can't acctually blame them because the developers used the Road Rash hype to get attention directed to them. But you can't also blame the developers for wanting to make their product to stand out on their own and bring their own ideias to light.--x--So, for people who were expecting Road Rash Remake I leave you this: The only thing that Road Redemption and Road Rash share in common are the bikes and the weapons (not the ranged ones). Their game design philosophy are totally different. BUT, even so, Road Redemption still is the closest you can get to Road Rash in modern games (at least that I know of)."

As an added plus, from what I've seen, the devs both appear to be very active and involved in their community, meaning the game's development is pretty stable.Pros+Stable, for the most part.+Controls are responsive, good overall.+Soundtrack is amazing!+Combat plays really well.+Decent selection of weaponry+Shooting requires a great amount of skill and comes with considerable risk, balances extremely well.+Interesting and fun cycle of map modifiers.[1]Cons[/h1]-Gets stuck loading occasionally.-One particular game modifier, the one where it rains cars, needs significant rebalancing (in my opinion, of course!): it's nearly impossible to navigate and any level with it requires 3-5 attempts to get through, all the while sucking off health and turbo; combat goes right out, so much attention goes to trying to avoid the raining debris that engaging enemies is all but impossible. Again, this one is opinion, your mileage may vary.-Grenade launcher explosion effect and actual AoE vary greatly - not sure if bug or balancing feature?-On the Rainbow Road-esque level, most of the railings have clip-through issues.Overall, the game is an incredibly solid BLAST to play. Most of the cons above are small issues, certainly no big deals (freezing on load notwithstanding, that is kinda a playthrough-killer...) For the price, I can't think of anything even remotely comparable in terms of enjoyment. I'd even say Road Redemption is my personal game of the year (not that that means diddle squat lol).So, yeah, TLDR; Game's great, has a few little issues here and there as expected with early access, BUY IT NOW!"

Right now there are only about four different environments (not including the SUPER MEGA ULTRA SECRET ONE), but that is something that I know will change.My only real complaints? Jump jet levels are boring and with the addition of The Headless Horseman (who unfortunately did not come with a matching bike) and Shovel Knight, that opens the door for more outlandish characters, instead of just a normal group of generic professional biker models, which is what all the other selectable characters are.Anyway, I fully encourage the purchase of this game, the playing of this game, the loving of this game, and the cheating on of your wives and girlfriends, but only on the condition that it's with this game.http://store.steampowered.comhttp://store.steampowered.com"

With the punks they have brass knuckles and they punch their victims off.A death metal gang who has long hair black clothing maybe they can headbang and you can hear music come from them and they have knives or machetes or chainsaws.A black metal gang that could have the same thing as above but in black metal style.A grunge gang with grunge clothing and their weapon is ciggarettes /alcohol bottles/ heroin needlesA stoner gang who uses pot paraphenilia to attack their enemies.A mob like gang who use vintage weapons and dress up like gangstersA ninja gang who use nunchuks and ninja starsThis can go onand onand on with as many gangs as you create.Then when you have more then one gang fight amongst each other they will have their set style and fighting style.You should be able to hijack other bikes and make it challenging so if you mess up you fall off.Other people should be able to do the same to you.Also police should be able to pull you overMake it so you can get away but make it a challenge for you to get pulled overMake it so they can pull over other people even people that you are in a race against and they do not even care about you.You can make choke points where they set up barriersThey can hit you and make your bike wobble at the end.Just do all cop things even make those things that pop your tireYou can see cops in the distance and then they follow you after you pass them.This is all the ideas I got right now.

Driving is more fluid now as well and stages don't jump around. After all these changes it is STILL early access.  Clearly the dev wont stop until he builds the best game of the genre!Buy it. Buy it right now.

,Not Recommended,300380,33971810,Posted: 2 August,all,MistahBoweh,"Quick summary:Controller support is garbage, which is a shame considering the genre. Game is also quite overdesigned, which simultaneously means 'loads of features' and 'mess to play', depending on your tastes. RR is aestetically pleasing in both visuals and audio and there's a certain charm to it, but don't expect your bike to handle anything near Rocket League. In fact, don't expect to be able to brake.The Review:I originally had a quite lengthy negative review for this game that talked about a handful of jarring issues I had in detail, some of which have indeed been improved since I posted it. I recieved a friendly invite to chat from the lead developer of the game tonight (9/22/17) who invited me to return as some of my complaints had been addressed in that time. I had the opportunity to talk shop with him for a while after that, and I found that we agreed on a few of the areas in which Road Redemption could have been improved.The changes that I mentioned above were mostly all due to overdesign. For the uninitiated, this means that the game is cluttered with too many systems at once, overcomplicating what could be an otherwise fun experience. You have an inventory that can fill up with dozens of weapons at once that you're expected to be able to swap between on the fly with no slowdown mid-race, ammunition that you have to manage for guns and explosives, meters for health, nitrus, jump boost and crit attacks that all need to be juggled, all while attempting to navigate semi-random traffic patterns, objectives and track layouts which fly by at speeds that don't need to be as high as they are considering all the other things that you have going on.In Early Access and even now in places, RR is billed as the spiritual successor to Road Rash, but part of Road Rash's charm was in its simplicity. Now, less than two weeks from the release date, the developers have rebilled Road Redemption as a roguelite first and foremost, and I definitely agree with that. However, that's not what I signed up for when I first backed it.The other thing I want to point out is that this game appears to be designed primarily with mouse and keyboard in mind. For people who are adamant about that sort of thing it might not be so bad, but I consider it a cardinal sin for a vehicle based game to have no analog controller support. You use left or right on the stick to turn as if you hit A or D on a keyboard, and have to hold LT to turn more sharply. Even then, the sharper turn radius doesn't kick in for a good quarter second or so, which makes the steering feel really unresponsive and not fast enough to react to obstacles on a randomly generated track with AI traffic that will occasionally change lanes and ram into you for no discernable reason. To make matters worse, your turning radius is not affected at all by your forward momentum or current speed. This means that your turning speed when the bike moves at a crawl is the exact same as when you're shooting across rooftops at 200 miles an hour.The other problem with this control scheme is that there is no brake. LT is your hold to turn button, but does not reduce your speed. Letting go of RT does reduce your acceleration after a bit with a sudden drop off, but you also aren't allowed to feather the accelerator because double-tapping it turns on nitrous, forcing you to go faster instead of slower. If this game was pure go forward racing and more generous with its turning you might not even feel the need for a brake or feathering, but much of the time you spend playing RR will be dedicated to bike-to-bike melee combat or missions where you need to attack specific enemies, and this requires that you are able to maintain a constant speed alongside the AI bike you're fighting with. Because of the lack of analog steering or acceleration/deceleration, this is much more frustrating than it needs to be. I often feel like failing runs has less to do with my ability as a player and everything to do with how little control the player actually has over their bike.All this being said, there were other issues I took with previous versions of the game that have since been improved, and there are some genuinely admirable aspects found within as well. The mad max voice work and sound design overall is on point, and certain weapons like the C4 charges are genuinely satisfying to use. The game certainly can be pretty if you want it to be as well. The physics can be terrible and the cycles fly in the air like they're made of papier-mache, but I know some people will find charm in such things. There's stuff to like casually in RR and I understand why it has at least some of the positive reviews that it has.The developer seemed like a genuinely intelligent person who understands the product that they made, and I realize how overall positive this game's reviews are, but I still don't have it in me to reccomend this title to people, because I would never reccomend that anyone play a vehicle-based game with a mouse and keyboard in much the same way that I wouldn't reccomend anyone play an FPS that forces them to use a controller. if you don't have an aversion to that, then maybe Road Redemption is worth a second look. It's just not for me."
76561198043519422,Recommended,300380,29060000,Posted: 6 January,all,Titmonkey,"I bought this game over a year ago hoping it would bring back some nostalgia from my road rash days. While it kept me ""entertained"" for a while, in the end it's not even close to a complete game. I feel like there has never been any clear direction for the project as it just seems like a bunch of redesigned road rash features mashed together with no purpose.The reason i loved road rash was it gave me an incentive to win each race (or at least finish on the podium). This would grant you cash so you could upgrade your bike. The progression was satisfying and you were excited to get that new bike.The opponents didn't seem generic. You might get knocked off your bike by Bill in one race only to get your revenge in the next race. Each race felt like an extension of the previous.Unfortunately in Road Redemption none of those Road Rash qualities come through. There is no real story, and no incentive to win races (I don't like the idea of character upgrades, it should have been bike upgrades). The controls are nice, the graphics are nice, and you do get a bit of enjoyment out of using weapons to disable your opponents but it gets old really fast without the fun ""grind"" you got from Road Rash.****EDIT Sept 2017****After 'Road Redemption Developer' urged me to try the game in its current state I gladly re-install and give it another go.The title screen loads up and i can tell the game looks a lot more polished. It's nice to see the campaign mode have an attempt at a story line. The enemies are substantially more difficult (or the handling is more difficult I can't tell which yet). Overall after a few minutes i'm pleasantly surprised, the only aspect of the game that I still don't agree with is the upgrades system. To me, it's not as immersive as if your character needed to upgrade his bike to perform better in races.There's no story line integration with how your character is acquiring these upgrades. It could be as simple as making the player enter ""the bike garage"" and ""buy parts + weapons"""" which could easily translate to the upgrades in the current build (ie. Larger nitro tanks = nitro boost etc.). I think without this kind of immersion, every race feels disjointed. If you add a story element to acquiring upgrades the game will feel more complete.The fact that the game has evolved so much since the time of my initial review brings me hope that this game will one day be what i've hoped for."

I kickstarted it because I loved RoadRash on oldschool Sega Genesis (inspiration for game) and I'm glad I did.Better control of bike, smarter ai (they now deflect etc), added some voice actors/storyline,, dev increased the strat/movesets with grabs, the new inventory management is nice, and they even added a rearview mirror up top. Game looks great and plays well.I'm glad the dev stuck with it and I keep giving it a chance once in a while.Edit: Just beat the game on a fresh character, using the starting bike/player, and it was a blast. Once the online gets completed this game will be great.Edit 2: Overall I'm still happy but I do not like how each rider affects the game. Make different difficulties, not a cosmetic choice tied to gameplay. Also - some of these are just ridiculous and it's clear the devs couldn't make the base AI decent enough to present a challenge without severe limitations getting placed on the player (way beyond what Civ/difficulty sliders do). Hallucinogenic maps were kinda crappy as-is but hallucinogenic rooftops is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.The rubber-banding is also still pretty bad only now it affects people ahead of you as well.

,Recommended,300380,35441349,Posted: 3 October,all,Lizardmancock,"For anyone wondering, Road Redemption does justice to Road Rash, despite being pretty different. It has more of an arcade feel to it. Less focus on racing, since everything is randomized and there are only a handful of unlockable bikes.Every ""race"" is a mission with varying objectives, like kill certain targets, finish as top 3, time trial, etc. I mean I say etc but aside from a few specific missions that's pretty much it I think + one where you have to survive.After every Race (They're pretty short, 2-3 minutes a piece) you get to spend the money you earned at the shop to buy weapon upgrades, health / nitro upgrades or refills, etc. and you earn XP to unlock stuff that persists (shop items are lost on death). If you've played the original Road Rash, you can see how they strayed pretty far from the formula but it remains really fun and in the same spirit. The biggest difference for me is that this, I'll sit down and play for 45 minutes and I've had enough - Road Rash I could spend hours on lol.Definitely worth the $20.Pros:-Now with Guns & Explosives!-Early levels ease you into the game, later levels are challenging (in-game unlock allows you to skip early levels)-Fast paced & action packed - never a boring race.-Randomized tracks, shop items, etc. to give it a bit of a fresh flavor every playthrough-And More!*note* The AI does this weird thing where if you're behind cause you crashed or something, they only go *so* far ahead so you have a chance to catch up. Similarly, if you're in the lead you'll never get further than *so* far ahead. Makes it so that you always have some action, but can also be frustrating when you're racing really well and bail once at the end only to ruin that mission even though you should have had an enormous lead.Cons:-It's buggy. Not unplayably buggy, but enough to mention it. Sometimes you'll stay stuck on an obstacle if you crash but don't fall off your bike. Other times enemy AI trucks will just wig right the ♥♥♥♥ out and trap you somewhere, forcing you to hit ""return me to course"" and invariably losing all your momentum / any advantage you had. The truck thing doesn't happen often mind you, but it shouldn't happen at all.-No Chain weapon like Road Rash :(-Small bike selection (It's cool that you have different riders with different stats now but there are only 9 bikes to be unlocked across the entire game, and maybe it's just me but the first few bikes all feel the same despite having slight stat differences. Also, according to stat bars in the first few bikes there would be no reason to use anything but the start bike as the others are all statistically inferior. I tried them, didn't notice much of a difference.)TL;DR - Buy it, it's good."

,Recommended,300380,35514445,Posted: 6 October,all,How up!,"Road Redemption is a ""polished"" new interpretation of Road Rash, a game many of us older guys have played in the past. Nostalgia is the main reason for me to buy and play this game. At first i was pleasently surprised by how the game looks in comparison to the old RR, but while playing there are flaws you should be aware of.On the positive side:NostalgiaNothing is more awarding than smacking an enemy with a hammer while driving at max speedNice Approach to get roguelike elements into this game eg. Experience ""farming"" and a skilltreeOn the negative side:They left out the ol' chain to smack enemies.Controls are wobbly. Neither gamepad nor mouse/keyboard give the feeling that you are totally in control of what your bike is doingWhen you start playing you will end up off the track several times until you get a feeling for the controls, and even after that you might get smacked off track, which is why there is a ""set me back on track"" option. I get smacked of the road, crash into smth and know that i'll be flying in the nect few seconds, but the SMBOT option doesnt cancel the crash animation so you end up staring at your screen at the same animation over and over until you get reset back.While playing w/ Mouse/Kb you actually have to use the keyboard eg. Space & Enter to accept and or apply stuff. For Example: In the buy menu between stages you HAVE to use enter to quit the menu. It's not a big thing, i know, but it puts me out of habit and i always end up clicking first.You can not end your game/exit to main menu in the buy menu between stages. Esc simply has no function in that screen. Which takes away the possibity to farm a certain amount of xp to upgrade a certain skill. You have to enter the next Stage to go back to the main menu.It bugs me that enemie vehicles almost always drive the exact same speed as you do while you approach them. When i approach an enemy while using nitro i expect to overtake him, not that he magically accelerates to the same speed when i'm in ~5 yards close to him. I'm aware that smth like this might be necessary so ppl don't just race through, or that it ends up being impossible to hit w/ melee attacks, so it's not really a complaint, but it still feels a bit off while playing.If you drive too close to a car/truck, you kind of get sucked into the rear bumper and loose almost all control over your steering wheel so often you end up w/ a sudden 90° powerbreak if you try to get to the left or right to escape that situation.I don't add in graphics, bc in my opinion RR graphics look out of date, but i don't want to compare AAA-Devs w/ Indie-Devs. Since the graphics don't add much to the fun i personally can have w/ a game like this, you have to rely on Screenshots/Videos/LetsPlays you can find for this game to decide wether you want to play or pass.Although my negative list contains more text, i still want you to play this game. If you loved RoadRash you will love this game too. And since this Game is a fresh release there is still the possibility that things get changed/patched so i will update my lists when i think that smth got better/worse.Edit:I yet have to play the Muliplayer/Online Part which i didn't up to when i wrote this. Couch-battles w/ friends might be the go-to thing w/ this game. Smacking friends is almost always better than smacking enemies."

For the uninitiated, Road Redemption is a roguelite post apocalyptic motorbike racer/killing game where you ride your bike down a long highway at ridiculous speeds while other bikers and cars try to kill you. You have weapons, including guns, wrenches, swords and bombs to ward them off while you meet your objective, including races, time trials, killing certain targets before they escape, and the occasional boss battle. The game is pretty simple, but highly replayable, and had a permadeath mechanic, alongside a loose progression system similar to many roguelites.The game is fun and immensely satisfying, and while not the most stunning game I've ever seen, has a good amount of polish and presentation. Go for it."
