But there is a major problem with it: the course curves randomly.""Why is that a problem?"" You ask.The reason is it's unfair, at times you don't have the ability to see what's coming fast enough to react. The obstacles can be hidden behind the course, or other obstacles, until you are right on top of them.Now I'm not the best when it comes to reflexes (I have yet to beat Hexagonest in Super Hexagon) but I am aware that despite my disabilities in the area, Super Hexagon is fair, you can ALWAYS see what's coming in time to avoid it. This game is not fair, since it advertises itself as fair, I cannot give it a positive review."

Not a great lifespan.The music isn't too bad if you're into this genre, so if you're willing to drop a couple bucks to chill out with a fairly easy game it's okay. If you're looking for a challenge, get Velocibox instead.Oh, and the mouse cursor disappears seemingly at random in the menu. Really annoying."

,Not Recommended,300400,33995867,Posted: 3 August,all,Epikas Jones,"A game where the ""difficulty"" is based on complete RNG, Do you have good reactions and memory? Well tough luck because they're useless here, Restart a level a million times till you get a good pattern and rail angles to line up for you, earn aches then uninstall the game or just uninstall anyways if your tired of the brainless nonsense. None of it matters anyways because it doesn't show or mean anything either does the hacked leaderboards.Whats strange is I don't know wether to call the games main description trolling, or simply ignorance of the developer but it's spot on for being everything thats it's not, I would call it irony but after reading the line that says ""eveything is your fault""  I'm going to go with the ladder.That literally sums up the entirety of the game you either have a fun successful run due to everything lining up just right or you fail due to an""impossible"" pattern or angle of view, your skill matters not. What I WOULD recommend is something like Thumper where skill, reactions memory ect all matter.Usually don't write too many nasty negative reviews but when I see devs of games being LAZY with their difficulty it just ticks me off. it just boils down to incompetence and a lack of ideas, of the which a game should not be released."

Also thanks to the style of the game, you never lose your overview on what obstacles are ahead of you. The game never gets unfair. If you fail, it’s always your fault.It’s just a press on the spacebar to start another try, and from the first minute on you have this “I can do it, I can beat my time” The game offers you 3 different difficulty’s to choose from.If you like this kind of game, you can’t make much wrong for the little price of just 3€."

,Not Recommended,300400,20095123,"Posted: 29 December, 2015",all,senna,"The idea of the game is very simplistic. Player should avoid obstacles while moving along its path. It's kinda like Wipeout Zone mode, but only without Zones.The idea is very fun. However, there comes couple some catches you wouldn't want this game.1. There is no progression. Your path is just the same 10 seconds, 60 seconds or 300 seconds into the game, so eventually it becomes boring.2. There are literally no settings. No sound volume, no screen resolution selection (thanks god it picks up your current desktop resolution), no windowed mode. I do understand why it's fine for a mobile game, but it's totally not fine for a PC game.3. The game plays very good with a controller. But... there are no support for a controller in a main menu. So the game is over (and it will happen quite often) you have to lean for your mouse.4. Achievements page opens steam browser, which causes your mouse cursor to disappear. And since you need it to start a new game, things become a little problematic.This might not be much, but it really breaks experience. Got the game for like 1$, still is not worth it. I'll prbably leave the game on a follow list, and will buy it again if I get like 75% discount, or those issues will be patched."

I decided to try it.I ABSOLUTLY LOVE IT! :D Throw some epic dubstep on and just rip through the game. Quite possibly the best 10 bucks ive spent in a while xD. I hope this game comes out with either DLC or updates (updates perfably :D) To change the color of the levels to like Red or Green or just a custom color option. I could see this game having a multiplayer aswell with like a 10 min timer and have like interlooping tracks with you and the other player and at the end of the 10 mins see who has the better time just for fun. I hope the devs read this and think about it! Id be one hell of a happy person. if this game had multiplayer id buy it for my friends and have a crap ton of fun. But as the game stands im still really happy with my purchase reguardless.

But, also, very difficult!In Unpossible, you bassically try to get at least a score of 60 seconds, to go on to the other levels. The levels get more difficult as you progress. There isn't a story in the game, since it's just a game where you beat your high score on each level. For example, the easiest level, (Daily Simplicity), is easy to get a high score. But, in higher and more advanced levels, such as Futile, its's more challenging, and requires you to think fast and on the spot about where you need to go, making getting a high score moe difficult as you progress. The only controls are A and D, so there isn't much complexity there, either.Overall, this game is really fun. I recommend it to everyone. Plus, it is a very cheap game, so, it's not hard to aquire a copy."

I played for no more than 30 minutes and apart from chasing achievements there's nothing else for me to do. I've seen every obstacle there is and played at every mode there is.

It is a good game and excels for wasting a few minutes of time should your mind find boredom waiting for other tasks to complete. Unpossible is simple to pick up yet difficult to master, requiring strong, constant concentration to avoid collisions. For its tron-esque appearance and addictive gameplay style I give it an 8.5/10.I have compiled a brief list of my thoughts/ideas for improving either your play or perhaps the game itself. They are suggestions so take them with a grain of salt. It’s Unpossible that 100% of my ideas are good.1. Have a 'training' mode where the user can select or deselect which types of segments will appear. (If there is a particular set of obstacles like the rotating triangles that keep killing you, then isolate them and practice running their gauntlet until mastery has occurred.)2. Add variable speed scaler in either the (+) or (-) direction3. Add color option to modify the luminosity/hue of Unpossible's color theme.4. For PC add controller support for gamepads, analog sticks, etc....5. Increase Max sensitivity range for controls.6. For those who might be having difficulty add a ""ghost' mode that allows the player to follow a translucent line through the obstacles. Users can follow the path and become familiar with certain 'difficult' areas of the game.7. Simultaneous multiplayer mode (VS.)Personal improvement area (at least it helped me)8. When playing, stare downrange as far as possible to see what is coming and use your peripheral vision to navigate.9. Practice when you first wake up after you've had a good rest and some healthy food.10. Try to position yourself on the upslope of the curve to see what is coming next.Finally, in update 3 you asked what the super hard mode past 'ultra' should be. I would vote the simple route. Call it 'Unpossible.'"

,Recommended,300400,19725940,"Posted: 15 December, 2015",all,Le Crab,As a short review it's a great game that introduces a very well designed 3D feel to the reaction game genre. For a pretty low price of $3 (as of 16/12/2015) it definitely should provide a few hours of gameplay.As a more critical review here are some points to consider:1. Sensitivity is really hard to get right. Depending on what obstacles you face it's either too sensitive for small precise gaps or too slow for long winding turns. For a reaction based game it's somewhat annoying to not have a perfect sensitivity that matches the games design of obstacles.2. Other than the few hours of gameplay I mentioned at the start I don't see this game being playable after that. Yes there are achievements but they are somewhat boring (for instance achieving 60 seconds on a certain level on 30 DIFFERENT DAYS? I get they're trying to make you play for longer but it's just boring and meaningless and there's no real sense of achievement).3. Music is questionable at times. For a cheap game it's not awful but it could definitely have been designed to be more dramatic rather than just mere electronic background noise.4. Visuals could have been so much better. I'm probably just being cynical at this point but considering this game was available previously for IOS and android and was originally released as $10 on steam the developers surely had some budget to ramp up the lighting in the game and sharpen the visuals (the black with blue neons had so much potential to reminiscence TRON).Other than that I adore the sensation of being inside the game this gives you compared to my typical reaction games like the impossible game or super hexagon.
