NXD4 N-F6 5. B-D3 B-C5 6. N-B3 BXF2+ 7. KXF2.  First move out of book by the computer is a catastrophic blunder.  A piece just to deny castling?  Ridiculous.Don't buy.  I requested a refund after eight minutes.Oops.  Left out the pair of moves 4...N-F6 and 5. B-D3.  Now inserted.  Actual sequence of moves is now correct.  Apologies to Wig Bang as his analysis is now irrelevant.  His comment, however, still applies.  Expert level was the highest level available for the first play.  The result was awful.  The chess engine's evaluation function has serious weaknesses.  It probably played 6...BXF2+ because the positional bonus for taking away castling and the positional bonus for giving check both added up to a value greater than the piece.Black can try to set up a trap with 7...H7-H5, but that should not work against any player of decent strength."

The notation board is much to big and ugly and you cant change it in size and everything else .. And its counting in the wrong way.... Move 5...4...3...2...1.... thats really disturbing -_-You cant even see the full notation after a game, only look the replay.... There should be a possibility to download a pgn file or at least the the full notation..."

However, this version of the game is unoptimized and broken. The game wouldnt even load for me when I tried to open in full screen mode and even on windowed mode the game would only stay open for about 20 minutes before crashing!I really enjoy this version of chess so I hope they update and fix these bugs and crashes. Otherwise, I would not reccomend that anyone purchase this game."

76561198116527414,Recommended,300630,25429938,"Posted: 9 September, 2016",all,Sigmar,"Finally, we have a nice, but affordable little chess game on Steam (without annoying advertisements, Simply Chess!), a necessity that was missing for a long time. I appreciate that I have the choice to play against humans, play against the AI or solve little problems with an increasing degree of difficulty. I feel a comfortable, relaxing and somehow noble atmosphere, brooding over my virtual board while listening to Mozart.The controls are something one has to get used to, and the game does not do a good job explaining itself in this regard.- Sometimes, it is hard to distinguish the different kinds of (glass-like half transparent) pieces from the default perspective; left-click and drag moves your camera though, and you can check wether this is a Queen or a Bishop...- Moving your pieces with your mouse does not work well sometimes, because the hitboxes are not set right; you can however solve this with your arrow keys.- Setting the volume of music and sound effects is explained ingame, but not in a helpful way; again, clicking the value and dragging the mouse (up or down) is the solution.- Finally: Leaving the game temporarily with ALT-TAB is not possible; if you want to read tutorials or do something else without quitting the game, you have to choose ""fullscreen off"" in the launcher menu.Such difficulties are more than unnecessary, and I hope the developer will fix them with patches!Nevertheless, the game works as it is, and I love chess, therefore I give it a 6/10."

No ability to redo more than a single move means no ability to play out differing strategies within the same game. The levels 1 - 3 are bizarrely weighted to play sudden random nonsense moves such as a queen taking a guarded knight. On higher levels it can play a decent game, but it will still make odd moves that no human would think to play. Most of the piece sets and boards are so bad that seeing your actual pieces is difficult with most combinations. When you rotate the board it stays there and is hard to return to normal. The screen is half filled with windows indicating moves and pieces taken so that no real estate remains and there are no options to remove or alter the screen layout. Stay away from this game as many free downloadable internet chess programs trump it in every way."

If you like chess then this would be another one of many good chess games you can play. The controls are very easy (as you would expect) and the different sets you can use are fun and unique! I got this game to practice before I go on a real chess site and play real people.The online portion isn't that great but the computer makes for a worthy opponent. Again, this game makes chess look good. I kind of wish I downloaded this for free on my Android device instead of paying full price to play on my computer. But if you don't have a tablet or would rather play on your computer rather than your phone I think it's worth getting. Have fun!"

So for me, the KI is fine. I'm actually stuck on rank 3, so there are 7 left. As soon as I do ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, the game punishes me. And of course sometimes the KI does dumb things, too.Whats left to say? You can save your game up to 6 different save games. If you are a core chess gamer, then the KI may be not challenging. If you are a bad causal chess player like me, then the KI will stomp you if you wish.It's just a good chess game."

76561197992782525,Recommended,300630,25519453,"Posted: 15 September, 2016",all,him,"Looks lovely and does basic computer chess well.Others have reported issues with piece selection and camera control. Personally I have had no issue with either - I simply drag to the camera position Iwant and let go, then it stays there whilst you play. Of course the pieces are so pretty that it's hard to resist flying around them all the time! Admittedly you don't have full 360 degree movement (you just swing around your half of the board), but in my opinion it does the job. I haven't had many issues with alt-tab either, though I do have to tap Tab twice in order to get out and occassionally it doesn't work at all.This is not a serious chess programme: it doesn't import/export games, allow you to set up positions, rate your play, train you (beyond basic move rules), play FICS or any of that. And the online isn't up to the job (you just press 'auto challenge' and it sets you up with a random, if any are online). But you have got Lucas/Arena/Fritz/Jin and the rest if you need those things.What it is, is a satisfying way to play a few games against a competent AI or a friend (locally or online). I've played a fair bit of chess and it's far better than I am. If could play properly then it may not be up to snuff, but for 90% of people I'd guess it was more than adequate. And because it's so damn pretty, I reckon it'll encourage me to play more.I do hope that the developers will consider adding some tutorials, maybe classic games (preferably with commentary) and allow game import/export. With such an attractive set-up, it would be a great way to step through a recent game on FICS, for example."

Marble, wooden and glass ones, and THIS game captures the feeling I get playing them.Its a beautiful game. Really feels like the game of kings, unlike other comic-like chess games on steam. Feels like the devs take it serious. It's made of beautiful graphics and environments. Even tough it could have more rooms to choose from, they really know how to make a beautiful setting to play chess."

76561198167199388,Recommended,300630,25830686,"Posted: 2 October, 2016",all,john4pap,"This is the first good chess game I've seen since the chessmaster.Game: The recent problem with developing chess games hasn't been getting very good chess engines but dumping them down to the casual chess player, say 800 to 1200 ELO. Chessmaster's lower ranking players were playing like grandmasters for several moves and then doing something stupid like sucrificing a queen just to justify their low rating. Pure Chess isn't like that. I've played through levels 1 to 7 and they all seemed pretty good simulations of how a human would play. I'm playing levels 6 and 7 regularly now and I'm enjoying every single game.I don't get how the rating system works. It includes ELO and some PureChess rating number. ELO is stuck on 1000 since day one while the PureChess rating gradually changes but not after every game. There should be more explanation about that.Graphics: Great! Yet, double check the system requirements: there're ridiculusly high for a chess game and there's not much choice in terms of graphics settings. You may think that a 5 year old laptop capable of playing COD4 will manage this... Well, it may not.Learning: There's nothing, just a joke set of courses about learning the basic moves et cetera. Get chessmaster for that (if you can find it).Multiplayer: Not worth it principally because there seem to be people not willing to make a move. If you're playing with your steam friends it's probably good (I haven't tried it)This is the best chess game I've ever tried and no matter the shortcommings it has been the first time I really enjoyed playing against a computer."
