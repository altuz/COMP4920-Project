AKA customization of u and ur team7- More movement of your team (they can go to A or B or whatever place, maybe not in straight line all the time). AKA, improve AI in general8- REALLY REALLY well done so far.(extremely cool graphics btw, really really polished)If you can improve this little things this could be an amazing game.A really really good one srsly."

Much prefer realistic modern uniforms, vest and other current tactical  gear.But a few times, i do get flash backs from raven shield!So currently  promisingUpdate:After 2ish hours of playing I can update the game to VERY promising. I just did a whole mission only killing 2 tangos my self, with ordering my team to do the rest, and they following my plan. This is a great thing! I got a serous SWAT/R6 feel."
,Recommended,300760,21145985,"Posted: 11 February, 2016",all,Isentil,"Reviewing the game in Pre-Alpha, version 1.07. As far as Early Access games go, this one is pretty solid. I also own Takedown: Red Sabre. Epsilon has very well kept some of the best qualities of Takedown and removed the worst qualities.I like the futuristic setting and design work for Epsilon, it's just a bit futuristic but not to the point that you're using rayguns and fighting martians. It works really well with the new Unreal Engine 4 graphics, which look great, as always.Epsilon has working squad commands! Your squad feels much more useful in Epsilon than in Takedown because of it. Enemy AI seems to be improved, as I haven't seen the glaring pathing issues that you would sometimes see in Takedown. The sniper and the planning phase mechanics are really fun!Overall: Good replay value, nice graphics, plenty challenging.I definitely recommend picking this one up! It's currently got 2 completed maps, no co-op yet, ragdolls, squad commands, It's worth the 8 bucks they're asking for now, and the price will only go up as they keep adding content. But yeah, it's a very fun pre-alpha that on its own, is already better than Takedown minus less maps currently available."

However it is currently quite lackluster and many things need to be improved (hence the game being in early access and in pre-alpha). I trust that this will be a MASSIVE improvement on Takedown: Red Sabre."

,Not Recommended,300760,25640000,"Posted: 22 September, 2016",all,Blind Captain,"This is in a ""proof of concept"" quality level, with updates being pretty rare (almost 5 months). There are some indications that it might pick up (from the developer's Twitter conversation with some other developers ""we gotta reboot Epsilon"" and ""Finally admitting I can't do this all on my own""). Until then, it's not enough to play like a normal game. I played for 25 minutes and felt like that was enough for me to get a taste of everything. That being said, it does seem to have promise, there are a few things I'm not a huge fan of, but overal, it uniqely fills a void left by Rainbow Six 3 and its predecessors. I understand this games vision and I love that vision. Whether that vision is actualized remains to be seen. So, if you want to throw in some money on the hopes that that might help this project move forward, go for it. But right now, it's definitely uncertain whether this will get finished or not, so otherwise, you might want to add it to your watch list and come back in a year or two."

Game is Early Alpha but it already plays better than some others Beta releases. Levels look good so far. minimal hiccups (one startup black screen issue I am sure they are working on) For the cost of a Starbucks coffee you can buy into the start of a game you can help shape. let's support it and make it ours!!!

I'm looking forward to seeing what the developers will be able to add in the future.  I think that the story element that they want to evolve is going to be really interesting and is something that a lot of games don't really tackle.  I look forward to continued progress."

I bought this game in 2015, it hasn't changed since.This game is in purgatory. What you have here is essentially a super early tech-demo. It is a vision of the game and nothing more, nor will it ever be.Keep your $7.99 and instead invest in older games such as SWAT and RS3, or check out Ground Branch. Just trust me on this one."

,Recommended,300760,25092267,"Posted: 23 August, 2016",all,KentuckyFriedSpy,"Epsilon is not bad for what is being charged at the moment. Epsilon in it's current state (pre-alpha) performs surprisingly well on lower end systems and looks half decent aswell. Epsilon features a few of the game mechanics that made the old Tom Clancy games great such as being able to pre-plan your mission (Rainbow Six 3), the fiber optic camera to scout underneath doors (Splinter Cell and eventually Rainbow Six) and the ability to open doors incrementally to provide much more cover when scouting a room for enemies and making entry kills (Rainbow Six 3). Serellan LLC are known for the subpar game Takedown: Red Sabre but it appears that the devs have taken into consideration what was wrong with the game as a tactical shooter and fixes a few of the problems in Epsilon, however it does carry some of the problems over like the somewhat sluggish movement system and the insanely fast reaction times of the enemy AI at times. Epsilon for what it is worth at the moment is not bad but you may want to hold off buying the game until some of the bugs and gameplay features are ironed out. All in all I like where this game is heading and it is great to see tactical shooters like this and Ground Branch coming back into the gaming world.Also a message to the devs if they end up reading this:Don't be afraid to ask the community for suggestions on how to improve the game as we all want to see this become an amazing game and we are happy to help to make this game become better than it already is.TL:DR Version:Pros:Follows old style of tactical shooters such as Rainbow Six 3 and SWAT 4Runs decently on older systems as far as I knowCons:AI isn't that great (to be expected in a pre-alpha game)Game has bugs (to be expected)"

,Recommended,300760,29572182,Posted: 29 January,all,RAXS_SLAYER,"This is something that has a lot of potential to become a really fun game. It reminds me of Rainbox Six Vegas 2, one of my all time favourite shooters. I think the major thing the developer needs to focus on is polishing some nice, clean base mechanics and then really pushing for content. The worry with this game could be overdoing it. If executed right, this game could have that simple charm that games like Rainbow Six vegas had. The thing the vegas had and this game didn't is smoothness to the movement. Obviously, this game is very early in its development so I could possibly be too critical in that respect, but it is definitely something that needs to be done right early on.The planning phase of this game is a really nice feature, but it is hindered a lot (and honestly quite frustrating) by how clunky it is. I think the cameras need a high sensitivity and should controlled with WASD. A and D should look left and right, and W and S should cycle between them. It's nice and quick and can be done without needing to use the mouse for everything. There are like 20 cameras per level and people are going to replay levels a lot so it needs to be fast and convenient in order to avoid it being really frustrating. The last thing you want is a nice quirky feature being ruined by how long it takes to use.Movement and aiming is something that needs a lot of attention. I feel the base speed should be slightly quicker in general, creeping around everywhere where not much goes on does get a little boring. The aiming is very hard to use due to the glitchyness of it. Couldn't imagine why it is happening but it is very jittery, and I would focus on having cleaner recoil, that was the thing that bugged me about Rainbow six, but you could counter it by going up against the wall. This game (I guess) isn't going in that direction, so clean recoil is a must.The bots are a little too fast to act. They need to dumbed down a bit by having a delay from when they hear shooting.Again, It's something I'm sure will be sorted out, but finding out where you are being shot from is a big issue. I can never see the muzzle flare from any guns being fired and there are no damage indicators that I can see.Story isn't something I expect to get from this game, I really wouldn't care if it is there or not. I think the focus should lie in getting some really good mechanics down and working on fun PvE levels. Because that is where I feel the real value could lie in this game.Perhaps consider a replay button when you die to go back to the start of the level with your plans already in place with the option to go back and alter the plans instead of wiping them every time.In short, this could be a game with a lot of playtime value if the Mechanics are cleaned up as soon as possible. It doesn't really need any more features that I can see, just a nice big pollish and then a push for content. I will follow its progress because I really want to see sucess in this title."

Vertical Movements, like rapelling and such.2. Futuristic guns3. More special equipment, like a remote controlled camera, sledgehammer, ie.4. Better animations and more animations (animations for things like breaching and opening locked doors)5. Customization.It's too early to make a clear yes/no recommendation, if you think it looks cool, you should buy it, it's only $7 and has a mass amount of potential, if not, keep your eye on it, and see how things develop. This could potentially be a great return to form for the tactical genre."

There doesn't appear that there is much going on with communication here from the dev to the forums. I'm speculating that this isn't going anywhere further at this point. I could be wrong. It's been a while since the company has posted in the forums and has pushed new content. If you don't want to potentially lose your money, walk away. As is, it is buggy and AI is either too good or in a down right vegetative state. Levels don't have any gritty realism and look to much like a game show set (shiny and bright EVERYTHING) than an actual building."
,Recommended,300760,18476489,"Posted: 14 October, 2015",all,J4MESOX4D,"Epsilon is a team-based tactical shooter currently in the early access stages being developed by Serellan. The game is in a fairly barebones state at present but with a decent foundation already in place; this could potentially grow into a very impressive game down the line. At such a generous pricepoint too; it is most definitely worth a punt even now.Firstly; the game looks absolutely remarkable, with a unique visual style of colours, outstanding lighting effects and stunning reflections. This aspect alone is very encouraging and makes this one of the most visually impressive early access titles to date. If each environment maintains this standard; Epsilon could stand against many top-end AAA games in graphical terms.This being in the very early stages though; many aspects are yet to be completed or are even absent at present. The developers have listed a wealth of features and improvements on the horizon which demonstrates they have a clear understanding of their product moving forward. The core of Epsilon is still very playable so far as you get to grips with the concept and mechanics. There are a few bugs and some rough parts but overall; it's a solid platform for the developers to build upon.The developers Serellan have certainly come under fire previously after the somewhat mediocre Takedown: Red Sabre but this title houses enormous potential and with lessons hopefully learned; I hope they don't make the same mistakes again. With 30% completed and another 12 months projected until the game is ready for a full release; it is certainly one to watch. There is still a considerable amount of work to be done in regards to developing and improving but with such a strong foundation already in place; this could be a very exciting title to follow."
