The issue with this game is that it lacks any coherence or execution. While making a ""WTF worthy"" game might be interesting for half a second, with no core discernable message the whole experience falls flat.Level design is horrible, requiring the player to trial and error there way through to various objectives- In fact I would liken the level design to the worst parts of classic adventure games: half an hour of ""is this where I need to go? No? Repeat"".Sound design may actually be worse than level design. I can put up with poorly designed levels as long as the soundtrack/scape is decent enough. Sadly, that was not the case. The game features no music (save for the few seconds of relief after completing a checkpoint worthy event) and the sound effects of ""busy city center"" and ""bugged out generic jetpack noises"" can only be listened to on continuous repeat for a maximum of five minutes before you feel like committing ear-seppuku in front of your moniter.To sum up:Concept is bad, level design is bad, sound design is bad, and now my ears breath their last breaths with honor intact."

I'll break it down, you're an astronaut floating through space to collect what appear to be ""memories"" of some sort, meanwhile there's guys with wings for heads and giant P's on the front of their attire. Although this game has it's amusing moments such as the cutscenes and sound effects, I can't really recommend it, simply because there's no replay value, no side stories, no options to adjust graphic settings or key binds and not even achievements to keep me interested. While I can't recommend it personally, I bought it for a friend as a troll attempt and it totally backfired, he actually ended up enjoying it to some extent.

Nor is it actually satiric or contemplative, despite what the developer claims.The way it works is, you float extremely slowly through three confusing but dull maps, looking for the four special floating objects that are secreted here and there. The scenery around you is surreal, but not in an exciting, interesting or thought-provoking way. Just in an it's-confusing-to-figure-out-where-you're-supposed-to-go-because-game-design-principles-went-out-the-window-and-everything-looks-the-same-as-everything-else way. There are exactly three animated character models in the game and they get resused ad nauseum. There are maybe half that many textures for the floors, walls, and ceilings.If you 100% the game, you unlock three special endings which display those same three character models floating in different but equally unexciting ways and some scrolling text which says something about not being ashamed because we are all rebels. So, there. Now you know.Seriously, don't bother. Not even for 50 cents. Go watch a Let's Play, since you'll experience the same depth of gameplay just watching it instead of playing it, and you can fastforward through the dull bits. (The whole game is the dull bits.)"

Clearly the developer has no idea what the word satire means. The ""humour"" in this game, and that's me being generous, is best described as ""omg lol i'm so random look how funny guys"". I'm thinking the game presents itself as more intelligent than it actually is. It's a game that prides itself on being something that it is not.The controls (of which there wasn't even an option to rebind them !) were clunky and imprecise and the constant sway of the camera were nauseating to say the least. The slow movement speed of the player character was just plain frustrating.Gave up after roughly 20 minutes, it was more than i could bear."

Do you enjoy watching bad movies from the 80's on VHS?  If you answered yes to any of these questions I'd recommend you stop reading my review and immediately purchase this game, you'll love it.  For the rest of us do yourself a favor, click not interested and by all means, even during a steam sale, when you see it for 49 cent... don't buy it..So my warning wasn't enough and you want to know what this game is about.... well aside from trying and failing to be a video game anybody on the face of Earth will like, you are an Astronaut who has found yourself floating in space...  We'll ignore the fact that no spaceship, capsule, satellite or anything needed to keep a human being in space alive, seems to be anywhere in sight, and the fact your character floats freely through space asleep and oblivious to everything around him....Out of the dark recesses of space come the P men....  or as I like to call them... PU men, cause they stink just as much as this game...  They strike your character sending him hurling towards what looks to be Earth...  Instead of burning into a crispy little ball of flame (which I'd have happily handed over my .49 cent to see) you somehow manage to come down unscathed, bounce a few times and then somehow wake up in the magical land of...   WTF were the developers taking when they created this World.  or CashGrab Land as I'll call.Inside CashGrab land you float from one point to another, using arrows, messages and other assorted random things to find your way around.  If you ever played an 80's game when you would spend hours wandering around the same dungeon looking for your next objective you'll understand this game...  The only difference is you'll be floating past PU creatures for no apparent reason, searching for beach equipment....  Why!....  Who knows why, I suppose the developers thought Space is like a vast ocean and tried to put some hidden message into their game..... NA they just didn't care...So wander around this CashGrab Land for a few hours, find your beach stuff and enjoy this game...   err well actually no enjoyment will be found or had with this game,  it just drains your soul.. much like a succubus after 3 hours of playing the only thing left to do is drool on yourself until someone comes along and frees you from it's sucktastic grip....."

It's even torturous to play because of how poorly it runs and how poorly it controls.   If the gameplay was more fluid I would only be left bewildered (although not in a good way), because this game is ♥♥♥♥ing strange.  In a pointless sort of strange.  What am I doing, what is this mess on my screen, why is there now a rave  going on, wtf was that thing... why seahorse, why have you done this to me, why.Sadly though, simply moving around the world is a struggle.  It would be difficult to get from point A to point B, if thats all you were doing.  But you are expected to explore a very confusing world, that can at times appear as though someone ate an entire bag of pixels and proceeded to vomit them haphazardly around my screen.I can't recommend to this to anyone, at all, ever.

The level design is awful, all of the walls and floors are some kind of bar texture which hurts your eyes and makes it hard to see anyway. The game doesn't make any sense at all, there are ""enemies"" on walls, ceilings and floors which can't seem to hurt you but i did find out that if you stand still infront of them they try to hit you. Also a feature i haven't seen mentioned in the other reviews is that this is literally moonbase alpha, by accident i hit a macro on my keyboard and all of a sudden i heard the well known moonbase alpha text to speech voice, if you press y you can bring up a chat, this allows you to say anything in text to speech with the exact same voice as moonbase alpha (JOHN MADDEN JOHN MADDEN JOHN MADDEN). Now i haven't played enough moonbase alpha to know whether this is literally the same game but with different levels, but it seems very similar. The camera also has some kind of smoothing effect or something which keeps the camera moving for a short period even after you've stopped moving the mouse. The developer says this game is two things in the description, satirical and contemplative. I really do fail to see how this game is satirical, it says ""we are mocking the hero, game characters, movies, comic books and video games we liked."", not quite sure how the main character is mocked during the game (or atleast as far as i got up to) and i haven't seen a single reference up to now to game characters, movies, comic books or video games. They say that the game is contemplative because ""you just have to walk through this world to understand how it works."", i don't understand how this ""game"" is contemplative at all. Unless i'm missing some kind of deeper meaning, flying around a maze of bars and collecting meaningless items is not contemplative. Overall this game is probably one of the worst ""games"" i've ever played, and i've played the slaughtering grounds...0/10"

Unfortunately the effects and scenes / levels this game generates to navigate are pretty bland and the immersion is lost as you drift down boring corridors with what look like Silent Hill Monster Spacemen floating about and twitching in the background. The game does very little to make the player interested in navigating to the next scene, with the same few models doing a different twitching animation in the corner of some dark area which might say have RED lighting instead of GREEN lighting in the previous corridor / corner. While I wouldn't say it's a horrible experience I'd just say it's more of a waste of time than anything and not very memorable or affective to any player investment or emotion."

Can get stuck on invisible edges - be pulled or prevented from going in directions for no reason at some time and not at other times. Buggy - sometimes can enter invisible walls causing you to be stuck outside the areas you should be in.Bad controls - very minimal and bad sound design - a maze-like level design where walls are lateral and vertical metal bars that interconnect each other (as you see through the wall) making navigation a jumbled mess. Dev seemed to almost troll by having boxes go through walls but push you around for no reason delaying and hindering your exploration, creatures and scenery are heavily reused everywhere, must often go to one end of the map to unlock something in an area previously explored and the game gives no indication of that forcing you to re-explore entire levels multiple times to progress - Dev added many scenes where creatures and the few scenery elements present are also sideways on walls and ceilings, causing me genuine vertigo and motion sickness.Whenever progress is made the player is rewarded by depictions of astronaut with buckets on their head or cutscenes of seahorses up close with a comical ¨you fail¨ high pitched trumpetNarratively there is no text or dialogue, and the game converys very little other than a fairly perceptible disdain from the dev for the customers, with nonsensical fetch questing of meaningless objects though a trial and error methodTo top it all off this game made it on steam through a loophole of steam greenlight where the dev used the pass for a different title to smuggle this in, and apparently weaseled out of giving bundle keys to legitimate purchasers of his game. Another one of his game he patched retroactively so it would stop launching (vigil bitterness) and would instead open the steam store page for RIP trilogy instead...Conclusion: Trash Dev - Trash Game - Good Riddance"
