,Recommended,301150,14733946,"Posted: 4 March, 2015",all,Chudah,"I never thought a game I picked up for less than a cup of coffee would be up there with my favorite Match 3 games of all time, but it is.  With gameplay that is easy to learn but hard to master, I found myself addicted to The Treasures of Montezuma 4 in no time.Gameplay consists of your standard Match 3 fair, swap the position of the tokens to match 3 of the same color to remove them from the board and score points.  The twist comes in with totems and power-ups that you purchase with coins earned by completing levels.  Chaining color matches will power up your totems and release their abilities onto the board. Determining which power-ups are most beneficial for each game board is where the real strategy comes in. Running out of time? Start chaining those oranges.  Find yourself stuck with few good matches?  Chain up a couple reds and let those fireballs fly.  Snap decisions and twitch reactions are required, especially when playing on Expert, but finally FINALLY earning Gold on that one level that's been giving you fits is so incredibly satisfying you'll want to keep playing until you can't possibly play anymore.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=396043035And there are plenty of game modes to play through.  Aside from Story mode which consists of 98 increasingly difficult boards, there's Puzzle where you can play through sets of specific games (Catch the Frog, Spring, Archaelogy, etc.) to earn collectibles, and Quest where certain objectives must be met on each board as you search for the missing pieces of a medallion.  The variety of games gives you lots of options depending on what you're in the mood mood for, whether it's the marathon session or just a quick fix.Good or bad, luck is a bit of a factor in the gameplay.  If you're stuck with a bad board layout, it's often better to restart the level and hope for better token placement than waste time trying to work with the wrong totems.  Sometimes you just don't have enough of the right color to pull off the chains you need; however keeping a level head and planning your moves and power-ups wisely can help you overcome some of the bad luck.  Then there are the boards where everything lines up so perfectly that you snag Gold within seconds of starting despite trying dozens of times to beat the timer.  Sure, that's luck for you, but I choose to believe that I'm just that awesome!Unfortunately, the rate in which you purchase your power-ups can be a bit slow.  The game plays best when you have all the tools at your disposal to deal with any given situation.  Later levels tend to be more enjoyable because you have most of your power-ups which makes things a lot easier to deal with.  On the other hand, purchasing abilities one at a time helps teach what each does without confusing you too much, so there is some merit to it.  But the game is most fun when you're fully empowered and chaining like a madman as power-ups, explosions and multipliers rack up your points.As one of the best impulse buys I've made on Steam, The Treasures of Montezuma 4 does not disappoint. If you are looking for more relaxing and casual fair, however, this may not be the game for you. But if you're in the market for a fast-paced and rewarding Match 3 title that will have you playing to the wee hours of the morning, you cannot go wrong with this gem! Even at full price, it's a steal. Steam achievements and trading cards are just icing on this already delicious cake.  Move over Bejeweled, there's a new king in town!Bottom Line: Highly recommended for all Match 3 lovers and is a worthy addition to any gamer's library."
,Recommended,301150,21062164,"Posted: 8 February, 2016",all,Samurai Vader,"The Treasures of Montezuma 4 is a casual match 3 game that practically doesn't bring almost anything new to the genre - but that doesn't mean the game is bad. While the only difference from other match 3 games is different upgrade system and graphics, this game still is a good casual fun - it's obvious the overused gameplay formula still works.What's unique there is a motivation to match more groups of blocks with the same color consecutively. That triggers special totem events that does something to the game board, destroying the blocks or changing their color.There's about hundred levels in basic story mode but after you beat this, there's also a Quest mode with even more levels - you don't have to worry this game would be too short.Conclusion:I'd specify the target group to people who want to relax but don't want to play free game with microtransactions and ads (like Candy Crush Saga). If you belong into this group, The Treasures of Montezuma 4 is a nice pick on sale for you. Others, looking for some more original match 3 game, I'd recommend checking Claws & Feathers, also by Alawar Entertainment."

It's not relaxing, your brain will constantly be on a heightened state of alert!!  It's a good feeling!The mechanics are designed excellently, which is what makes it shine so well.  Once you're fully powered up by progressing through the game you'll have access to totem bonus's which are activated by creating chains of two or more  matches.  Each of the totem's has a different bonus effect.  You also make bonus effects by matching 4+ at the same time.  So there is a lot of opportunity for effecting the game.  There can be some wonderful moments of scoring when you start chaining bonus's and totems together, it's possible to clear the whole board and get some massive scores, and it feels satisfying!I've clocked 25 hours currently and am still finishing the game and chasing achievements.  There are multiple game modes which you score gold, silver and bronze in.  As with all match-3 games there is an element of luck involved but you can battle against this with your skills, reactions and an eagle eye!The music is pretty cool too!I'd highly recommend Treasures of Montezuma 4, if you want a fast-paced match-3 game there is no better."

It's a very fast paced game, with a cool way of activating special powers. It's a lot like Treasures 3 but with more variety. There are cool cosmetic trophies to collect and also a great upgrading system. I'm only partway done and expect to spend many more fun hours on it.The only reason I can think of for a match-3 fan to avoid this is if they don't like the fast pace. I really like it but I know some people don't.Updated: performance has been greatly improved so I took that part out of the review."

,Not Recommended,301150,12843683,"Posted: 8 November, 2014",all,Irvitzer the Toy Soldier [⇄],"I wish I can give that game positive review, but I just can't do this. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who looking for nice casual game to relax.Yes, it's seems nice and colourfull, idea with totem mechanics sounds very interesting, but there is one big problem: if you want to get reward for your gameplay, you'll need hell of luck. Some levels you can beat only if you lucky. You can get one or two nice matches from very start, got combo and complete level in 10-15 seconds, or you can match tokens on the very same level for 5 freaking minutes and lose. You can lose levels with frogs or fire/ice/gold tokens just because you won't get any of these for 2 minutes. Just a pure luck (or bad luck in that case).Don't get me wrong: I clearly understood the fact that ToM4 is just a casual 'match-three' game. But even a casual game usually require a skill to beat them on high difficulity, and if you have that skill, you'll beat the game, 'cause your results won't rely on solely luck. For ToM4 you'll needonly pure luckto win. Not got enough green tokens to match them two times in row in first 10-15 seconds? Forget about gold-tier score, you won't get it for that time. Last tile in 'Match Pairs' placed in corner of the table? Pretty like you won't manage to open it, unless Red or Blue Totem'll destroy that part of table. And so on, and so on.That's... That's awful for casual 'match-three' game. Game that won't allow you to win without any significant reason is not a game that you want to play for fun."

,Recommended,301150,19595161,"Posted: 9 December, 2015",all,Thalatte,"Game SeriesThe fourth installment of the ""Treasures of Montezuma"" game series. Previous installments: ""Treasures of Montezuma,"" ""Treasures of Montezuma 2"" and ""Treasures of Montezuma 3.""Game Visual/AudioThere isn't much can be said about the game's visuals asides from that they're nicely done. Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. The visual and audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu.GameplayThe objective of this game is rather simple. Match 3 or more tokens (horizontally or vertically) to clear them from the board. The scoring varies from how many tokens has been matched. Also, how much time is left on the timer.There special bonuses to help making matches a bit easier. There are totem bonuses and token bonuses. These bonuses can be unlocked at certain point in the game. Gold coins are required to purchase and upgrade them. Gold coins are earned from playing the match 3 levels. There is a negative side in having totem bonuses because it requires the same color tokens to be matched two or three more times before it becomes activated.There are two different game difficulty modes to choose from: Casual and Expert. The only difference between these two difficulty modes is how fast the timer depleted in the timer bar.There are three different game modes: Quest, Story and Puzzle. Story mode is already unlocked but Quest and Puzzle game modes are locked. Quest game mode can be unlocked only after the Story game mode is completed. The puzzle game mode becomes unlock after completing the first puzzle in the story game mode.In the story game mode there are over ninety-eight levels altogether. Seven different totems with fourteen levels each. The first totem is unlock, while the remaining totems are locked, completing the totem will unlock the next one.In the puzzle game mode there are eight different puzzles to solve. These puzzles come with a collections of items. Completing the puzzles will unlock them.In the quest game mode contains series of task objectives that needs to be completed.All of the match 3 levels can be replayed for a better score.[Please do note that you can continue playing when the timer runs out. You won't earn any coins to upgrade the bonuses. This only applies to the story mode part of the game.]MiscellaneousThere are total of five different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator. This feature is only available Steams version of the game.Final thoughts, it's an okay game, there's nothing much to it. As for the game's replay value it's low. I would recommend this game for those who enjoy playing match 3 games. Also, I wouldn't recommend buying this game at the full price.http://store.steampowered.com/app/301150"

Yes this game requires you to grind your way to the top. I've seriously done more grinding than Tony Hawk at a skate rink, I've been doing more grinding than my grand pa's teeth at night, and I’ve done more grinding than a Barista at the most famous coffee house in Italy. Just grind, grind, grind and grind. Thanks Alawar!!!https://www.alawar.com/This 3 match game is a serious improvement in comparison to Montezuma 3 which is sold with a terrible bug attached, however it doesn't mean that the game is without some faults of its own. This 3 match version follows the love story of two ancient lovers who are being chased by an evil butterfly hater. Seriously, in opening shot the bad guy kills a butterfly just to prove how evil he is. The good prince makes escape into an open portal to another world, but his princess gets shot and killed before she is able to enter. Cut to the future where we learn that her soul becomes one with a future librarian blonde Anna. Yes once she was brunette, now she is blonde. She finds the ancient book travels back to the pyramids where the talking totems are (no archaeologist has ever noticed the talking totems before?)  and unlocks their powers to re-open the portal where she is immediately re-united with her ancient boyfriend who has not aged over the last 1,000 years and happens to just be standing at the portal opening forever still holding onto her ancient crown because he has nothing better to do in that portal world. When he places the crown on her head the future Anna is obliterated and ancient Anna comes to the fore where they kiss and hug and provide for what is supposed to be an awwww moment.It's not an awwww moment, it’s a seriously WTH moment. You just killed someone to bring someone back. That’s MESSED UP!!! Is future Anna still in there? Does she have multiple personalities now? Why didn't lover dream boat prince just kill himself so that his soul could float into some future existence body and try and hunt his beloved Anna down through eharmony? Oh that's right because he is stuck in a portal where he just gets to sit there twiddling his thumbs for an eternity while Anna does all the work. Loser!!!The 3 match mechanics are practically the same as the previous instalments, the main objective is to make simultaneous colour matches like a blue 3 match followed by another 3 blue match, this unlocks the totem which provides its magic on the board grid, from more time, to score multiplier, to mass colour changing, to fire ball exploding, to other perks all depending on which colours you match simultaneously. Blocks that contain gems will help in multiplying your score more than normal blocks do. You have a minute - 2 minutes to reach the score requirement needed to unlock 1 of 13 latches on each of the 7 totem portals (91 challenges).In addition to this you have a quest mode which requires you to meet a series of tasks while 3 matching trying to produce a gold rank on each location on the map. This can be quite challenging for instance one task was to make 10, 4 matches within a minute and believe me when I say this the board never makes it easy.There is also a puzzle mode. Which has 8 different types of matching games like catch the frog while you three match, to drop the golden coins etc. There is a bronze, silver and gold rank with each one providing a specific item for your ancient collection. Here is where the grinding really kicks in and the weakest most frustrating design development in the game. As proven by the PS3 community, the items rewarded from the puzzle board is actually quite random and is not based on your skill at all. So to collect all the items necessary in the collection just requires you to farm them until the game chooses to reward you with everything. Since you can't plan anything, this side of the game becomes a chore once you realise that. A very dumb mechanic to the game.Still with patience and a week of your life you should be able to 100 percent the game and the task does feel rewarding when you have done it, as there are a significant many challenges in your journey to do so. A 3 match game that has a personality of its own that separates itself from the iconic such as 'Candy Crush', but still doesn't seem to measure up to when you save the chocolate mountain from the evil black liquorice monster.Below is me showing you what the game looks like once 100% I also show you the last level 7-13.

But there aren't much games, which can entertain so many hours like the TOM-series.With the totems and the boni you have always the special flow, which doesn't make the game boring. The difficulties and modi makes the game very attractive and challenging.Also I have to mention the awesome background-music, which make the game-fun even more intense. There is a part of a music, which even made me goosebumps. But sadly this part come always pretty late, that I had to intentionally play the LVL a bit slower to be able to enjoy this moment :)I haven't much critism, but if someone want to hear some, then here some little things:I was very unlucky on the puzzle slotmachines, to get the calendar:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=928944640As you can see on the right corner, it took 32 tries and this was a bit annoying at the end.Also to get the ""Eternal Flame""- Achievement was a bit annoying, because you had to play the completed story-modelvls again and again and you didn't earned any high XP or gold anymore. There it would have been a bit better to add this gamemode to the puzzles too.A bit strange were the names of the playerlvls. In the early LVL you were some kind of ""Master"" and on a higher LVL you became a simple ""Collector"".

For casual gamers this may be ok as it is just a matter of time pass. But for achievement hunters this may be even tedious if you wish to grab all the achievements. Playing this game for a long time and by grabbing all the achievements, I think, each of the rounds has a game winning set [Algorithm] and until you will not get that set you need to try and try. By buying all totems and bonuses will help you enough though.

It's Bejeweled with upgrades, but the upgrades are necessary, forced, and mostly sucky.  Almost half of them require you to match 5 jewels.  The other half require you to match 3 colors twice, one after the other, and it's rather poorly explained.Also, you don't get any graphics options, so it's pretty much stuck in derpmode."

I bought Montezuma, Montezuma 2, & Montezuma 3 from a different online store (Big Fish Games) and I love those games! I just recently found out that they had a fourth one and since it was on Sale on Steam I decided to buy it! It's an absolutely wonderful game! Definitly tops the first and second one, the third one and this one have about the same graphic quality but I like how this one incorporates an actualy storyline in it! Helps make gameplay a little more intersting! Not to mention something you'll find in this one compared to the other three is ""Challenges."" There are lots of challenges that you can play and re-play including stuff like trying to catch as many frogs as possible or trying to get the water to the plant in time. And like in the past three games, you still have the usual match 3 elements and the store is still present, but personally I liked the one from Montezuma 3 better as you actually had a choice in what you wanted to buy. Usually there is only one or two things you are allowed to buy at a time compared to five or six in Montezuma 3. But I won't complain much about it because all the powerups are still there from the previous games plus some new ones! And they can really help your gameplay, especially when you get into the harder levels!Overall this is a great Match 3 game! It can definitely be very relaxing but it can also be very intense at times! If you are a fan of Casual and/or Relaxing Games or have played games like Bejeweled or Fishdom and you enjoyed them then I definitely think you will really enjoy this game! (And don't worry, you don't have to have the other 3 in order to understand what's going on! This is the only game to date with an actualy storyline in it so you won't miss too much!) With that being said, if you are not a person who likes Casual Games then I'm not 100% sure if you will find this game enjoyable. If you do, then I find the price of $6.99 very reasonable since usually for games like this I pay at least $9.99.I recommend this game if you enjoy Match 3 Games or Casual Games!"

I hate the new gold-silver-bronze time limit, the nasty frogs, the ice, the torch which was designed to fade 1% every second, and the so-called archaeological grounds in which god knows how many craps were burried. I want the simple and exciting match-3 which made me happy when I was bored and need stuff to let it go, but not so interested in solving random annoying manmade problems. This would ruin my leisure time.煞费苦心，设计谜题，导致玩家在游戏中不得不瞻前顾后， 本属其特色的爽快感大幅降低。希望开发者能够少一点套路，多一些真诚。"

Unfortunatley this game does not deliver. It tries to be inovative with new game modes but they are not carried out well and a few of them are too similar to each other. This game is also a terrible pc port there are no graphics or res options and the sound bugs so the same two seconds of the song repeat over and over unless you exit the game entirely."

,Not Recommended,301150,11476413,"Posted: 30 July, 2014",all,Tartrazine,"I really enjoyed the first Treasures of Montezuma game on iOS, but this isn't as good. ToM is a match 3 series where the main twist is that you can activate various powers by matching the same color twice. In the first game (which isn't on PC), your exciting and straightforward goal was to match up a quota of specially marked tiles before time ran out. But this fourth game switches between several different gimmicky goals, none of which is very satisfying. There's still a brutal time limit... but only for getting a gold rank on the level, because there's no way to fail a level, and you get to progress regardless of how long you take. Doing poorly doesn't give you as much money to unlock better power ups, but you'll always get to move on to the next level so who cares. (Basically the game does the equivalent of dumping a poor student in the ""remedial"" math class that's so full of delinquents and idiots that no one learns anything, but they all 'graduate' anyway). And even if you decide to take the game seriously and try to get gold on every level, you'll be slowed down by the distracting animations of the powers activating, and the matched blocks' exploded fragments raining down ON TOP OF THE BOARD THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SEE WHILE THE CLOCK COUNTS DOWN EVERY PRECIOUS SECOND.One of the other reviews mentioned that (SPOILERS!) a time traveling Cortez shows up, so I was hoping for wacky characters like the cannibal ogre in the first Puzzle Quest but so far it's been just ""MATCH COLORED TOKENS TO MAGICALLY EXCAVATE THE TEMPLE!""tl;dr - Go play the first Montezuma game if you've got an iPad, or I guess go play Bejeweled if you want a PC equivalent."
