,Recommended,301190,12997666,"Posted: 18 November, 2014",all,RemyLabue,"With over 230 compositions under his belt, Frederic Chopin was one of the world's leading musicians in the 1800's. He's been referenced and even starred in multiple video games in the past, and Resurrection of Music is the latest in that trend. It's probably the best fit, being a rhythm game full of imagination and heart. This is an easy recommendation to anyone who enjoys music.In Frederic: RoM you play as Chopin himself, recently raised from the dead, and musically battle other musicians across the globe. Armed with nothing but a magical piano, it is up to you to show that you are still relevant in an age of Auto Tuners, Synthesizers, and Pro Tools.The soul of this game is in the music, which is fantastic. A selection of Chopin's own works are remixed to fit the theme of several countries as you fight for global domination. Forever Entertainment has shown great care and creativity in the construction of these songs. Frederic's compositions ring through beautifully, which is a testament to their ability, considering how easily they could have ruined these amazing pieces. Rhythm games are only as good as the music they include, and with so many of them asking the player to provide their own songs these days, it's nice to see a developer actually take the time to hand-craft original tracks. Each song is not only fun to play, but catchy, enjoyable, and memorable as well. The soundtrack comes with the game when you purchase it through Steam, making the price tag all the more worth it.The gameplay is easy to pick up if you've ever played a rhythm game before. Hit the keys when the notes pass over them. The closer to accurate the timing, the more points you receive. Once you get a combo going, you can pick up bonus points for hitting random keys on the keyboard, and even utilize a musical attack to mess with your opponents. While it's not very deep, it's a blast to play, and you'll feel like a true pianist as you do. Who doesn't want to feel like Chopin?While you duke it out with these other musicians, colorful and silly animations play out in front of you, themed to the country, just like the music. They can be very distracting, adding to the difficulty of the duels, but are entertaining in their own right. Sometimes the caricatures and parodies can border on offensive, but they are all in good fun, and people are too easily offended these days anyway.There is a story here that plays out in animated scenes in-between battles, but it is told horrendously with some of the worst voice acting you'll ever experience in this lifetime. That being said, this is a rhythm game, and who plays rhythm games for the story? You can easily skip these sequences and you won't miss anything important.What else is there to say? Frederic: RoM is a fantastic experience that should not be missed. There is a sequel called Frederic: Evil Strikes Back, so be sure to check out my review on that game as well. If you enjoy this game, and want to learn more about Chopin, be sure to check out a game called Eternal Sonata, or Trusty Bell depending on your region. You won't be disappointed."
,Recommended,301190,17911126,"Posted: 6 September, 2015",all,Jadarma,"OverviewFrederic: Resurrection of Musicis a rhythm game in the tone of Guitar Hero, but you play a piano instead. You are the reanimated corpse of the famous composer Frederic Chopin and you travel around the world having musical duels with stereotyped characters and did I mention remixed music?The Pros:Fun Story and Cutscenes- The game features a bit over an hour of cutscenes as you progress through the story and encounter all sorts of musicians. The animations are choppy and the voice acting amateurish, but the end result is fun, enjoyable and very stereotypical. Don't expect this game to be serious, 'cause it's not - and that's great!Great Music!- The most important aspect of a rhythm game is the music, and Frederic doesn't disappoint! There are a total of 12 tracks you can play - 9 story related and 3 bonus. All of them are reinterpretations of the original Chopin's plays, but in contemporaneous styles: electro, reggae, country, R&B, you name it. The sound quality is also superb and the music is very catchy.Complimentary and DRM-Free OST- The game gives you the tracks in the game for free as high bit-rate MP3 files, so you can listen to them anytime, anywhere. A good gesture from the developers! Kudos!Gameplay Choices- The game lets you choose whether to play this game using the keyboard or the touchscreen! That's right! Native touchscreen support for the tablet users who want to be the next virtuoso! For the majority of us who will use the keyboard anyways, it's still very enjoyable, and as a pro-tip from me, change the controls from AWSEDRF to ZSXDCFV. The new spacing of the keys resembles much better with piano keys, so you accidentally press the wrong button much less often.The Cons:Moderate learning curve.- The songs are relatively very easy, and the songs are repeated segments that you will most likely have in muscle memory by your second playthrough. At first, however, it seems really hard, especially with the default controls, but after you play it for a while it will come to you.Level Rating System- I have no idea what the game wants from you when it gives you the stars at the end of the level. I found myself ending up with one star despite having a 98% accuracy.Almost no difference between difficulties- There are four difficulty steps: Too Easy, Normal, Hard, Chopin. The last two have a negligibly small amount of extra notes compared to the others, and the only real difference between them is the number of points you get for hitting the notes and the amount of notes you are allowed to miss, as the harder the difficulty, the more notes it takes to fill the progress bar and the more it will decrease when failing to press a note. On Chopin, you are expected to have a 90-95% hit rate to pass, which is not hard after you get used to it.Conclusion:This game is a good rhythm game, albeit short, but features original, awesome music and an interesting concept. Recommended for those who like remixes and comedy indie games.If you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work,consider joining my groupandfollow my curatorpage!

,Not Recommended,301190,20195339,"Posted: 1 January, 2016",all,Fellvoid,"A brilliant idea that could have been realized into one of the most interesting rhythm games of all time suffers from bad design. Both ""Frederic"" games' control scheme, both on PC and on touchscreen, is just too cluttered to be understandable. It's to easy to get the order of the notes mixed up. Not to mention that it's extremely uncomfortable to have your hand in this position. The fact that I'm someone who's familiar with keyboard instruments may have something to do with the controls bothering me, making them unnatural and confusing. Also, like all rhythm games, during a song will come a moment where what is heard and what is played has nothing to do with reality, which will also irritate and confuse musicians. Beyond that, the soundtrack is not at all anythign spectacular. Most remixes tend to simplify the originals in attempts to modernise them. As a fan of rhythm games and a musician, I can't recommend this. It's confusing in design and sometimes wrong in sound. However, this is absolutely subjective, so I would recommend trying ""Frederic"" out. The premise is fun and there are a few moments worth your while, if you manage to get over everything I've said. If you think that the above mentioned things would not bother you - enjoy being the resurected and modern version of one of the best composers the classical era has to offer."

I found myself drawing many parellels between this game and Elite Beat Agents, and as you can tell from my user name, that is a definite plus. The cut scenes are wonderfully drawn in comic book style and have an offbeat, often satirical sense of humor, and the story is just as fun as the gameplay (I used a mouse to play, personally, as I found it easier than keyboard controls, no matter how many times I changed the default layout. That said, I can see where this game would fare much better on a touchscreen or tablet, and it does, in fact, have touchscreen capabilities). Even during the gameplay, which has a sort of Dance Dance Revolution feel to it in terms of layout but are hilariously set up like ""battles"", if you dare take your eyes off the notes for a moment, you'll notice many crazy and entertaining things going on in the background.Best of all, and perhaps the most important part of any music game, is the music itself. As the title and description implies, the hero is the composer Frederic Chopin, revived in the modern world for reasons unknown to him and finding himself confronting many people with different musical styles. For each confrontation, the music is a piece by Chopin, masterfully remixed into the style of both the region and the type of musician you're facing in the level. From mellow reggae to exciting wild western; from Celtic dance to my personal favorite, a hip-hop inspired track that manages to be haunting at the same time, you've never heard Chopin like this, and you likely never will again. And fortunately, the soundtrack is included with the game itself, no strings attached. So do yourself a favor and give this one a try. Even if you find yourself disliking the actual game, the price is well worth it for the soundtrack alone."
,Recommended,301190,12339493,"Posted: 3 October, 2014",all,kuska,"My first thought was like ""oh god, another music game based on the same system"" and who the hell would make a game about Chopin today. Well, this was something that caught my interest at that point. After watching some videos, I gave it a chance.There isn't much of a plot there. Frederic Chopin rises from the dead and he needs to find out about identity of a mysterious guy who wants to beat him. The story is pretty flat, in fact but this is more like an arcade game that a story game.There's a limited amount of tracks to play, however four difficulty modes. It may sound boring but what makes it exciting is the ability to challenge yourself. It's pretty hard to get to three stars rating even in 'too easy' mode.What's pretty interesting is how the music and mechanism is made. It looks like there's a bunch (or at least one) pianist down there in the software development team. If you've ever played Chopin on the piano, you'll get what I mean once you play the game.Some people complained about controls. I don't find it very hard. What can be confusing at first is that if you're used to the piano, you feel frustrated with no black keys, which are obviously situated above the white ones on the piano's keyboard. But it's not something you can't live. You'll get used to it at the end anyway.The game is addictive. I tried once and I keep returning. Probably my return rates will fade out with time but the game has this ""something"" any decent game needs and I'm pretty sure of it. Give it a go."
,Recommended,301190,12871397,"Posted: 9 November, 2014",all,WidescreenRules,"I do receommend this game even with a few minor issues and one big one, but the negatives don't outweigh the positives.The game is effectively a Rock Band 3 keyboard using Frederick Chopin as the protagonist. The variation of Chopin's music in different styles, including Irish, rock, and others, is an absolute delight to listen to. The music alone is worth the price of admission as far as I'm concerned, and there are several of Chopin's best pieces to perform. The minor issues include mostly bad voice acting, especially that of Chopin, and *really* long (but thankfully skippable) cutscenes.They can easily be ignored; however, I have to recommend this game primarily to people who have touchscreen PCs or laptops. As an amateur keyboardist, I found it very difficult to come up with a PC keyboard layout that was comfortable for me. Admittedly, you might find something better for you. But the game felt far, far more natural when I played it on my touchscreen laptop. (The game has its roots in the tablet arena, so this isn't totally unexpected.) It was much more enjoyable to play, and I had a lot more fun with this game than I expected I would, especially after getting frustrated with the PC keyboard.So, if you own a touchscreen laptop or Windows tablet, I absolutely recommend this game, especially for the price. Just don't expect the best voice acting out there and get ready to skip cutscenes. Otherwise, this game is worth the low price."
,Recommended,301190,20400729,"Posted: 8 January, 2016",all,Ryan Dorkoski,"Frederic: Resurrection of Musicis a great little indie rhythm game that will certainly entertain those interested in the genre.Don't get me wrong - this is not something paradigm-changing likeCrypt of the NecroDanceror the first wave ofGuitar Hero, but the price doesn't suggest that, either.What-you-see-is-what-you-get with this one.You use the keyboard, with your hands in the typing position, in order to play notes piano-style to the appropriate rhythm.It doesn't have the highest production value in terms of music or graphics, but the addictiveness that comes with any great rhythm-based game is surely here.Pros:+Incredibly cheap price for a game that will certainly entertain you as long as you wish (considering there is story mode as well as just trying to beat your high score with multiple difficulty levels)+Its quite fun for nearly all skill levels+While the music is not Danny B in quality, it is catchy enoughCons:-Some people complain about awkward controls, etc. Idon't completely disagree. They certainly take some getting used to, and are probably never as smooth as other great rhythm titles.-Doesn't really bring anything new to the table, or push the genre forward. This is usally a bigger deal for me, but considering the price tag, I was pleasantly surprised with what this title does right.Bottom line: if you are into rhythm based titles, this is certainly worth it, even at full price.I was planning  on buying it and most likely refunding, but I'm keeping this little indie gem."

John Lennon and Mozart in a park in Paris while the gamer is using the W A S D keys to fend off musical notes. This game builds finger dexterity needed for more complex games. One could play it on short breaks at work. It would be good for someone with a short attention span especially due to illness or medication. It is non violent but still has battles and testing of skills.  The art design is +10.  I would ve used this game as a screen saver the art work is that unique and interesting.

Playing with a Keyboard is doable, but painful. Which I find somewhat ironic.Voice acting is nothing worth writing home about. It's laughable. NecroDancer did the whole ""Animated Comic"" thing better, without the awkward and off-timed mouth movements.The music isn't great, and if the whole ""Classical Is still the best"" thing was actually true, the pieces wouldn't be so heavily remixed IMO. I get it, it's to fit the location, but it still seems weird.The plot isn't anything great either.For $3 it's a ripoff. For $0.30 it was worth a shot.TL;DR: It'll stay in my library, but will probably become one of those ""Filler"" titles."

All you have to do is push the button at particular time. Sounds easy? it is not... First time I tried normal difficulty I was lost and couldn't progress. After transfering to easy difficulty it was a bit too easy to progress and I finished game without much effort. Since it is skill based game I had to play it on harder difficulties and i already completed few songs on hardest difficulty and I like challenge the game can offer.PROSSoundtrack.I like classical and recent music and this games offers perfect soundtrack for me. This game combines classical music with other styles. You can find all tracks used in the game in installation folder/OSTGameplay.For a person who likes music this game is awesome. I could enjoy music while pushing buttons to rhythmNEUTRALStory.Yes there is a story you follow in a game. I put story in neutral section just because the story isn't really good and enjoyable but this story is better than nothing.CONSBackground.While I played game I was concentraded enough to not see background but there were times when I couldn't properly see notes coming towards me because of background. I think it could have been better with less things happening in background.CONCLUSIONFrederic: Resirrection of Music is really nice and relaxing game despite of skill requirements. If you decide to play find keyboard bindings best for you (i use two hands) and once you find it start from easy difficulty.

The slightly confusing UI layout and input controls might not really help to make it easier though. Even if you can customize your keyboard layout I really haven't found a setting that makes it playable instantly. Difficulty in levels also fluctuate quiet significantly between the stages some earlier ones I found harder than some of the later ones and the last two are extremely hard suddenly notes seem to come from everywhere. So be warned this can be quiet a challenging game. Not sure how somebody will be able to survive the higher difficulty levels.The presentation however is very nice and funny. Using a ressurected Chopin is a genius idea. If you like pieces of Chopin even though modernized with modern music styles this might be your game otherwise I would say better stay away from it.

On 1 hand it's too easy to press the wrong keys on the PC keyboard. On 2 hands the fact that there are 7 keys makes it awkward to split the keys between 2 hands (3 on left, 4 on right or the other way around). Feels very unnatural. Frustrating.On a device without touchscreen the only options are keyboard and mouse, and it isn't a game really meant to be played on a PC keyboard or mouse. Unfortunately, there's also no option to play it on a gamepad (even though I suspect it'd still feel awkward to have 7 keys on 2 hands).I still want to play this, as the game is graphically and musically good, but I can't recommend you buy it, unless you have some kind of piano keyboard connected to it - that can be mapped to letters such as A, S, D, F.

I recommend considering the bundle for the price, but this is probably the stronger of the two games. Gameplay is engaging, driving you to improve and take on higher difficulties. The visuals are solid, a bit cheesy but charming. After a short time, you can tell that there are only 3 voice actors, but the work can be hilarious. Maybe so-bad-it's-hilarious, but I still like it. It has smart writing, and doesn't feel dated, unlike the memetically-stuffed sequel. It could use more options with audio controls, but I can let that pass. Note latency doesn't seem to be an issue.Here are some of the best Chopin-inspired tracks I've heard. Catchy yet powerful, you'll be able to recognize and learn them. The tracks are very enjoyable, with fun patterns and good pacing. It takes a bit to learn how to do well, but the easy difficulties allow most anyone to complete the game. I'd say there's easily over 90 minutes to complete the game, with good replayability in higher difficulty options. I'd recommend the bundle at full price if you like the idea and plan to beat all the difficulties. If you are just wanting to play once or twice, I'd recommend a 50% off weeklong deal."

Although the game is exactly what it looks like (Piano Hero with remixes of classical music), the music in itself is astonishingly varied, there’s electro, country, pop, reggae, a freaking lullaby and I have absolutely no idea what kind of warped mind turned a beautiful classical song into something straight out of the 8 Mile soundtrack but they did it; and I’m actually happy about it.The game features nine stages with three additional unlockable stages in arena mode and although the soundtrack seems fairly short it makes up for how enjoyable they are. The game does have a lot of annoyances as I have already explained in the first half of this review, however you can easily get over those annoyances, cutscenes are easy to skip and you can use your keyboard instead of the stupid mouse implementation (I recommend using a two handed configuration such as ASDF JKL because the default option sucks).Overall Frederic Resurrection of Music is a dumb game, but it’s the kind of dumb that’s actually fun once you get over how dumb it is. I can’t say I recommend it for the full price, and I can’t say I can recommend it if you are easily offended and/or are allergic to stupidity incarnate, but I will say that I enjoyed this game quite a bit for the low low price that I paid for it."

Just get used to the way the notes coming towards you it'll be all fine.The basic accuracy judgement of this game is quite forgiving, the way I feel it, the sweet spot lasts longer than the IIDX's ""perfect great"", which should give newcomers more confidence on it. However, in pursuing higher score, the random golden notes are a distraction for sure, in my opinion this isn't a good way to raise difficulty.The content of the game is good enough, at least for a sale price.(I pick it up for less than $2, really can't blame it) More than 10 remastered classical pieces can make your coins count, and they sounds fair. As for the story, I'll say it's simple and encouraging, but I'd prefer to leave it to you to dig up more.This game has touch screen support which is nice. If you have a x86-based windows 8 tablet(not RT), try it out. I guess playing it on a touch screen would be similar to Konami's ReflecBeat.Wrapping it up I would give this game a 8 out of 10. Solid game, but it can do better in replayability, and obviously needs more titles to play: this is the very soul of this genre."

Usually that means an over-priced, un-optimized, low budget piece of garbage.  And I will say the regular price may be high (it seems to be free on IOS with in-app purchases, I haven't downloaded it on my iPad so I don't know how bad the IAPs are...)

No BS energy bars, no paywalls,  just sweet sweet game.Story and Voice Acting:  The story is terrible, but it's terrible in a campy B-Movie sort of way.  Chopin wakes from the dead in the modern age, gets handed a magical golden carriage and grand piano, and travels the world to music duel various folks.  The voice acting ranges from terribly hillarious to simply terrible.  For example, the Rasta trying to hide his Eastern European accent was a good laugh.  Also, some of the racial stereotypes can been seen as racist, whether intentional or not (this falls under story and VO as well as art.)  2 out of 5, but only due to the campiness of it.Art Design:  The art is pretty decent, done in a motion-comic style.  It is definitely done in a comical style.  Nice use of colour.  I enjoyed it, although again racial stereotypes are a thing here.  4 out of 5, they are on a budget, but did well with it.Music:  This is where the game shines into the shiny gem it is.  The music is Fragging Incredible!  It is inspired by Chopin's classic compositions, as well as the regions you duel in.  There is not a single track in this game that I do not like.  They are all really well done.  The music director of this game did a fantastic job.  Admittedly, it will not be for everyone.  However, they touch on many genre's here, yet with it still being very piano heavy.  Dubstep with piano is now the only way I can enjoy that attrocious genre.  10 out of freaking 5 here!Gameplay/Controls:  DO NOT USE THE DEFAULT KEYBOARD MAPPING!  I will combine gameplay and controls into one category, as they pretty much are the same thing in this game.  This is a rhythm music game.  Not unlike Guitar Hero without the plastic guitar.  Now, I was not able to test the touch controls as I do not have that as an option.  From what I hear, they are great.  If you have the option, that's the way to play.  I, however, used a mouse and keyboard.  Mainly keyboard.  I first tried the default control mapping, and I could not get my head around that.  It basically maps all the keys to your left hand and relies on the mouse with your right.  Couldn't do it.  I remapped everything to the home row, going left to right and not caring about the white and black keys on the piano, and bingo!  With my setup, I had no noticable delay between the sound and when the key is supposed to be pressed.  This control scheme worked well for me, all though it made it difficult to get the extra points from the few notes you need to swipe left/right now as this uses the mouse.  As gameplay is control in this, as it's a rhythm game, I'm going with 4 out of 5 once you get a mapping that works for you.  From what I hear, it could be higher with an appropriate touchscreen.Overall:  Alright, all things considered I really enjoyed this.  The price I paid comes into play as well, as I paid about what a large coffee would for two games (this is only a review of the first), as I got this on sale.  So, a charming art style, decent controls once you fine tune them to you, excellent music, and a terrible but campy story and VO...  Hell, I had a great amount of fun with this.  Near 4 hours so far on the first game, and more to do with the Arena and the final achievement if I want it.  I am giving it:4 out of 5.  Even at full price at $6.49, it's great fun.  If you can get it at a steal go for it.  Must buy for any music lover."

The core gameplay is so-so: on most standard keyboards, the WER keys are not exactly between the ASDF but shifted slightly to the right which makes the default binding awkward to use. The cutscenes have nice artwork, but the pacing of the dialog is so slow, it becomes infuriating to sit through. On the other hand, if you want to force yourself to not skip them out of fear of ""missing out"" on content, be warned that any keypress you perform will skip the cutscene. So for example, if you press shift-tab to open the steam overlay, you'll skip the cutscene. Or if you press F12 to take a screenshot, you'll skip the cutscene.For rhythm-game fans, if you've played any amount of Beatmania/IIDX, go ahead and jump straight into the hardest difficulty ""Chopin"": It's still easier than even a mid-level light-7 song on IIDX, and there are only 8 levels/songs in the whole game.

Zombies, questionable stereotypes, motion comics, a spattering of maymays, those kind of hot muse girls from Hercules, impossible achievements, rage inducing note combinations, keytars, the only good parts of rockband, the ♥♥♥♥♥iest, most incredible voice acting you've ever heard and of course, neat lil critters in hats.I had a gosh diddly darn hoot playing this game and I literally go back and play my favourites again and again cause the music team did such a good job with these remixes. There's something about these over-synthesized (but in a good way) masterpieces that hold true to Chopin works but also with elements of modernism that remind me of my audio engineering school days sitting at a computer with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Pro-Tools plugins and a half busted MIDI keyboard. It's brilliant. I can't say it enough.The art style is pretty whimsical in the broadest sense of the word. You can tell the art team gave absolutely zero ♥♥♥♥♥ about  anything and just drew what they felt like drawing. The voice acting is so beautiful. It's like the same two guys that bet each other 50 bucks to see who could do the worst accent imaginable and they absolutely nailed it. It's all weirdly phrased and low-key questionably racist but it's an absolute pleasure to just sit there with a blank look on your face trying to figure out what the heckin frick is going on.Tbh fam, after Russia I just started skipping the cutscenes cause a) My crippling ADHD won't allow me to focus and b) I really didn't care cause the actual playing part of the game is way more fun and I knew there was a sequel so I made an educated guess that Chopin was gonna be razzle dazzliin his way to F:ESB. Can confirm you don't miss much so :shrug: I  guess.As far as the actual gameplay goes, it's pretty straight forward. There's no tutorial, so you gotta either be smart enough to click on 'Input options' and see the keybinds or be like me and lose the first battle 3.5 times before you realise what to do. You can use the keybinds, your mouse, or what you'll need to do once you reach the Chopin difficulty, a mix of both. I find it helps if you choose to click the black keys and use the keybinds for the white keys or vice versa.Overall, this game is a mess, but it's a beautiful, hot, sticky mess that you still would do 10/10. It's honestly just super weird and strange and fun and has a super high replayability if you like the music or want to go for those achievements.

I bought this game blindly, it was only about 70p so I thought it was worth the risk. I'm not really sure how it's classed as a game you just press the corresponding keys to the notes using ASDF and for the semi tonal sharps and flats the keys 'WER'. It's essentially Guitar Hero with a ""piano"" but without the fun. The music on the game is horrible, I only played one song I enjoyed which was the none remixed Frederic Chopin classic, most 'songs' sound like the crap I have to endure at the gym, just constant, repetitve noise. I wanted to like this game cause it's a genre which has potential, however the horrible voice acting, horrible cut scenes and lack of gameplay just makes me hate it. The animations in the background constantly put you off too and often visually interrupt the sequence you have to follow, making it even more frustrating.The game is different to anything I've played before and hope for more titles within this niche genre, however the issues I have with the 'gameplay' and horrible bits inbetween make it impossible to recommend.

This game used to be one of my top 5 favorites before it let me down.I can't recommend this game anymore due to it's crappy touch input, ""freezing up"", and scoring screw ups.As I've remarked on several occasions in community discussions (which gets no response as well), the touch input stops responding after a few minutes. It not only ruins gameplay, but it also messes with the timing- the game ""freezes"" for about a second and then starts at a totally different spot, and the ""keys/notes"" are no longer in sync with the song. This has happened on more than one device- so far I've tried at least 6 (4 laptops and 2 tablets), with different specs ( 1 laptop with a 2.0 GHz processor and 2 GB of memory, 1 laptop with a 2.0 GHz processor and 4 GB of memory, 1 laptop with 2.1GHz processor and 6 GB of memory, 1 laptop with 2.5 GHz processor and 6 GB of memory, a tablet with Windows 8.1 OS and a tablet with Android OS).At times, the game ""freezes"" even when I don't use touch input.Also, for some reason, after quitting a game and then coming back to it, the scores are not the same, it's like either the game can't ""remember"" my last score or it totally ignored it.I bought the second game, ""Frederic ESB"" and that happens every once in a while, but with ""Frederic ROM"", it happens a lot and has been getting worse.What a waste of time and effort.

What does not seem specially interesting in the writing, proves a great challenge and a rewarding and fun experience, due to the quality of audio presentation and elegant simplicity of the game.The story is nothing to write home about - it is a mere excuse for another musical clash.PresentationThe game is a comic story sparkling with the music inlaids. Graphical layout is polished and competent; yet it never is anything more than just a introduction for musical fight and you will rather skip it after watching it once. Fortunately skipping withSpacekey is easy.The core of the game are compositions of Chopin, reworked for the game. The main theme of the great works is still there, but a beat line and a stylization towards a particular music genre, makes the whole fresh and enjoyable. The music is fantastic and the tunes stay in the head for long after the games has finished. And there is always room for improvement as there are 4 difficulty levels.Summing uppositivegreat musicgreat replayabilitygood range of difficulty levelsgame for everybody, no aggresion, violance, strong languageeducational aspect - if anybody cares ;-)negativelimited gameplay ideashort - 10 tunes (Frederic: Evil Strikes Backawaits though)Well-executed, unpretentious rhythm game with great music.

By execute I mean kill it.  There was so much potential for this to be a good rhythm game, however, the music is a  crappy midi file probably designed by someone who has never heard an neoclassic piece in their life. Not to mention the charactters in the game are grotesque stereotypes that not only give persons of other culture an offensive, unamusing, flat character, but also the music of other cultrues is blandly misrepresented and poorly composed.  Also, the game has inconvenient controls and no option to remap. I do not frequently use Steam refund, but this poor excuse for a game was not even worth the $0.60 I paid for it on sale."

This was a beauty for me. It was almost as tacky as the movie ""the Room"", but at the same time, it was really entertaining. The fact that most of the voices and accents are seemingly English is also humerous to me.I absolutely loved this game, both from a rhythm game perspective, and an Indie game perspective.

I wouldn't pay full price, but the bundle that also includes the sequel is definitely worth it if you see it on sale for 99 cents.The biggest flaw I can find is that the extra Arena mode songs require you to play on a specific difficulty to unlock, so even if you beat the game on the hardest level, you'll have to play the story mode two more times on a lower difficulty to unlock everything. Fortunately, difficulty only affects the requirements to pass a level, not how many notes there are, so that won't be as boring as it sounds (but it will be a problem for less skilled players who struggle with hitting notes)."
