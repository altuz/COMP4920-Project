,Not Recommended,301200,12997728,"Posted: 18 November, 2014",all,RemyLabue,"Frederic: Evil Strikes Back is the sequel to one of my favorite rhythm games of all time, Resurrection of Music. If you haven't yet read my review on that game, take a minute to do that now.RoM was a fantastic game for many reasons, the most important of which is the music. Carefully remixing select compositions from Chopin's work was a stroke of genius, and was the heart and soul of an amazing experience that should not be missed. If you haven't yet played it, you are missing out on something really special. So the sequel should be another masterpiece, right?It is with a heavy heart that I have to condemn this game for what it is. What made the first game special, the music, is why the sequel falls flat on its face. Take the heart and soul from a work of art, and you're left with an unrecognizable shell, feeding off of the success of its predecessor. That is what has occurred here, and I couldn't be any more disappointed with the results.When I try to imagine what they could do to make a fantastic sequel, I see many possibilities. Something as simple as more of the same, remixing more of Chopin's compositions into more tracks, would have been perfectly acceptable. Teaming up with other well known musicians like Beethoven or Bach and remixing their music would have been great as well. If the premise isn't broken, then you shouldn't try to fix it. Forever Entertainment has already proven that they are more than capable of doing any of those things, so my expectations were high for the next game in this franchise.Unfortunately, that is not the direction the developers took with this sequel. All of the tracks in this game are completely original, and instead of matching the style of a particular country, they match the style of famous musician. For example, a couple of the characters you come across are parody versions of Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga. Not a terrible idea, but the original music fails to be catchy, fun to play, and in some cases, even tolerable to listen to. As I have stated in the past, rhythm games are only as good as the music they include, which makes this game absolutely terrible.Taking Chopin's work out of the franchise entirely just doesn't make sense to me. Remixing his compositions to fit the style of these particular musicians would have been easy enough, and it would have been interesting to hear Lady Gaga's rendition of Raindrops. Without his music, this game just feels uninspired, and it becomes a chore to even finish it.To be fair, the rest of this game hasn't changed a bit. The gameplay is exactly the same, the art style hasn't changed, the story is just as nonsensical, and the voice acting is just as stroke inducing as in Resurrection of Music. There are no surprises here.It's a shame that the developers forgot what made the first game so special. Maybe the third game in the franchise will return it to its roots, but I will be researching it first before wasting money on another sequel."

Whereas the previous installment was equal parts satire of the recording industry and love letter to the late, great Frederic Chopin, this one has more nods to musicians that were deceased far more recently, with amazing tributes to the likes of Falco, Freddie Mercury, and Michael Jackson. You won't hear Chopin's influence here, but you'll still hear some amazing tracks that duplicate the folk and contemporary music of the regions that you visit. It's not only deceased musicians who get their due, either, with characters lampooning the likes of KISS and Lady Gaga.The part that was disappointing to me, however, was the story. The first game was quirky and charming, with clever satire mixed with other jokes and jabs at pop culture or random silly bits strewn about.

It's still entertaining, it's just sad to see the hero, who was so lovable the first time around, turn into something rather obnoxious with little reasoning for it.SPOILERS:At the beginning of the game, Frederic loses his heart (I assume in a metaphorical sense, considering the imagery), which could explain the way he's behaving, if it weren't for a few things: 1.) he still manages to be kind and charitable when it suits him, 2.) he was acting this way both before and after it was returned and 3.) the first game already dealt with him trying to find his heart, in a more literal fashion (a nod to the controversy surrounding the fact that while Chopin was interrered in Pere Laichez cemetary in Paris, his heart is enshrined in an urn filled with alcohol in Warsaw). Basically, he's already gone around without a heart, and managed to be a good character regardless of it, if an unwitting pawn in a grander scheme.That's not to say this game isn't without its  own degree of charm and humor. Most of the references are nods to internet memes this time around, sometimes subtly, sometimes more obviously but to hilarious effect (especially the ending). But as a music game, if you're not in it for the story, then it's still more than solid. The soundtrack is easily equal to, if it doesn't surpass, the first game's, and the gameplay hasn't been radically changed, but mixed up just enough to keep it fresh.It's sad that the storytelling isn't as strong as it was the first time around, but like the previous game, the fact that it includes a free copy of its stellar soundtrack makes it worth the price of admission alone. That you get a fun and quirky music game in the deal is all gravy."

Now to explain how impossible it is to play this on pc, so I played the last game with my mouse and had a generally good time the story was dumb and the ending fairly awful, but the music was good , this time you cannot play with a mouse no matter how good you are with one. basically from the onset you are beset with a swarm of notes that you will miss most of, and as you go further it obviously gets harder and more likely you will get a lower score. Keyboard is no better you're undoubtedly off tempo with keyboard, like I changed up the keybindings  for keyboard and, even though I followed the tempo i still missed almost every note. So yeah controls are awful seriously just play this with touch input. there is a point where I almost quit because a German dancing robot hit me with a million simultaneous notes at once, like how do you hit all those notes at once? do i just slam my hand all over the keyboard and hope for the best?Maybe I should have headbutt my monitor for best results.TLDR:Aside from some decent music, this game is a definite pass.Play the previous title in the series, way more fun and you get to play as a proper respected Chopin, not some swaglord ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who by the end of the game goes super saiyan for some ridiculous reason.If you absolutely must get this game wait for a sale, do NOT buy at full price it's not worth it.2/10"

It's different now. Frederic no longer plays his own sonates and concerts, but has to perform the variations of the more recent music instead. Most of the tracks have recognizable 'prototypes'. Final boss track just ROCKS.++ the story is still there, somewhat even more hilarious compared to F:RoM++ the gameplay is more varied now (e.g. pairs of notes, coloured notes)+ the note patterns  seem more logical and less chaotic. I think it's a bit easier than RoM, though some have it vice versa.+ the characters are all good (and hilarious too)+ cinematics are as good as in F:RoM (sometimes even better)- Those who had prefered mouse for the first game are very likely to be annoyed. Some things don't go well with clicking (like hitting double notes or playing some sequences). But controls had never been the strongest point for the 'Frederics'."

This game no longer features compositions from Chopin but alterated version from Pop culture songs from Queen to Lady Gaga. It still has the slight quirky humour and a resurrected Chopin as the main character is really an awesome idea. Funnily either I got more used to the game controls now or this one is actually easier than the first one. Especially I found the later stages in the game not as difficult than the in the first game. And the final boss I actually managed to defeat on normal on the first try. If you liked the first Frederic Game definitly get this one it is more or less the same with a few tweaks (like double nodes). If you don't own any of the Frederic games I would say get the first one first.

Aside from all the other reviewers mentioning the songs not being Chopin songs remastered, which didn't bother me at all, I think this game is far worse than the first. The art is very samey everywhere, Chopin acts like a rock star, there are memes all over the place, and worst of all they made it impossible to play the game with a mouse alone. Big mistake. It's not my preferred method to play these games with the keyboard and they force you to if you want to keep your combo up, or play the game on anything but easy mode. Still, when it goes on sale, pick up the 2 pack of games for this one's soundtrack alone, as I think there are a few good standouts worth listening to outside of the game itself."

(Spoiler!: look out for the smooth criminal in Hollywood) The artwork seems to have been improved as well in this version, but the same cheesy humor that is prevalent in the first game is still here and has only been enhanced. This whole style of dialogue is reminiscient of monkey island, which if you haven't guessed yet is one of my favorites. Don't buy this game for it's gameplay value unless you really enjoy Rhythm based games such as guitar hero or Dance dance revolution-esque gaming.

If you are a classical music fan and was hoping for more Chopin interpretations, you'll be disappointed. Unlike the first ""Frederic"" that used modern takes on Chopin classics, this version uses close approximations to more modern music. The music is still really good, though. (As a Queen fan, I particularly enjoyed their take on ""Radio Ga Ga"".)And also like original, I recommend this more for those who have laptops with touchscreens or a Windows Surface. Trying to play this game on a PC keyboard is a source of great frustration for people who play musical keyboards because it's very difficult to get keyboard keys in a position that accurately approximates a musical keyboard. But playing on a touchscreen feels amazingly natural. Even more difficult levels still feel good to play with a touchscreen.So, if you have a touchscreen laptop or a Surface, I *highly* recommend this game as  well as its predecessor. If you're on a PC keyboard, remap the keys until they feel just right for you or else you're going to be in for a lot of frustration."

I recommend getting both in the bundle, don't bother with this game alone considering the similar price. The gameplay is good, with a few new note types in this game. However, the entire style of the game shifted awkwardly. Visually it seems better, but Chopin is less charming and less developed as a character. He's no longer a stranger in a new world, but more of a 80's popstar working to save himself. More of the jokes go from awkwardly hilarious to groaningly memetic. Meanwhile, the voiceovers that could've started their own memes are notably toned down. It's harder to tell that there are only a few voice actors in this version, but it's less charming and natural.Probably the most important thing is the music. This time it is far-less inspired by Chopin, but the tracks are enjoyable to play. Nothing stuck with me the same way as the first game, but it's still fun. Fans of the story may be underwhelmed, it's not quite a classic. There is fair replayability if you are aiming to improve and complete higher difficulties, but it's easy enough to complete on the lower difficulties in 90 minutes. I can recommend the bundle at full price if you like the idea and plan to beat all the difficulties. If you are just wanting to play once or twice, I'd recommend a 50% off weeklong deal."

Music pieces are newly composed without much relationship with Chopin himself, which may disappoint some ppl. But the game play is actually improved a little bit. Levels are a bit more challenge than the regular levels in the previous work, but less than the arena levels.Personally, I'm really looking forward to other series from this group involving other famous musicians with brand new story lines rather than expanding Chopin's with other new pieces."

Some music was out of place to certain fights. But my favorites have to be the Russian one and the final boss.Many gripe about this being a touch screen game and yes, it was meant to be that.

,Recommended,301200,34476885,Posted: 25 August,all,Weedwacker2000,"Soooo this game... it is enjoyable in my opinion. Is it worth $8? I would say no which is why I bought it when it was on sale. I began on the hardest difficulty just to see what the game had in store for Chopin (Hardest difficulty). These are the difficulties in sequential order (should go without saying, but just in case): 1. Too Easy  2. Normal  3. Hard  4. Chopin. Honestly I could not see the difference between Hard and Chopin as they looked the same to me. People who are saying that ""Too Easy"" is difficult surprise me. ESPECIALLY when they've only played the game for 0.1 hours. If you're one of these people.... please.... shut up. Give it at least an HOUR before bashing on this game's controls and saying that ""Too Easy"" is hard.Now as for the controls.... the default ones are pretty weird and uncomfortable. I never used the mouse so I have no idea what other people are talking about. I changed my controls to make the game easier. I left ASDF alone, but changed the black keys to IOP since it made the game easier. That being said, the controls still were weird and take some time getting used to. I do not play the piano nor have I ever used you in a serious manner, yet the game was still fairly easy. So do you need experience with playing a piano to be good or decent at this game? No. Would it help if you did?.... Well I cannot answer that since I do not play the piano.As for the story, I felt that it was slow paced. No I don't mean there was filler, just it seemed like there were many awkward pauses between dialogues. I came into this game hoping to get a few laughs in, but that did not happen. I would say it was mainly due to the long pauses between dialogues. Think of it as a joke in real life, your friend builds you up and towards the end he just pauses too long and by the time the punch line is delivered, you go, ""Eh/ Meh"" since they took too long. A poor analogy probably since I did not feel any build up from this game to begin with. Story was good for the price paid though and the graphics were great, like the art style.Now for the music in the game, I personally only liked the music from Falcon's, Villain Mike's, Russian Robot Dancer's, and the final boss's battle. All of the other songs did not really appeal to me or feel like they fit in with the person you were competing with.Also here's a tip for you people who think ""Too Easy"" is hard... try playing Geometry Dash, Super Hexagon, The Impossible Game, Melody's Escape, or Audiosurf 2 (Fast paced songs) . Those games will help improve your reflexes for those types of games and games like Frederic: Evil Strikes Back. I highly recommend Geometry Dash out of all of these though since it really helped me with my timing. And play levels on Hard, Insane, or even Demon to really improve. If you stick with the easy levels, you'll be wasting your time..... though you're wasting your time regardless if you play easy or not.... whatever do what you want in your ""valuable"" life. Hope this helped or got a smirk out of your depressing face. (If you take offense to this then............ I don't know how you handle the real world if you cannot handle some sarcastic internet crap.)"
