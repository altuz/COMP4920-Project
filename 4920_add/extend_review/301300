The story behind the chickens being the true good guys and us slaughtering them merely for chicken burgers really struck a cord in me.I felt like the bad guy - but it left something inside me that I knew I wouldn't forget.Lovely time with this title - the inclusion of online multiplayer was an enjoyable surprise and I am happy you went for it.Look forward to the next title!

76561198062228454,Recommended,301300,10799758,"Posted: 25 June, 2014",all,OCEE,"A great sequel to the franchise. If you have played the previous games, you already know everything about the game. The game has new weapons and unlockable content, obtainable through collecting keys. The unlockables range from purely cosmetic effects to adding a few addition atack types. This gives the game some replayability. This installment of the franchise also features online multiplayers, as previous only had local co-op.But unfortunately, atleast for me, not enough has been changed from it's predecessors. If you have played previous titles before, you will get bored pretty quickly as the gameplay is identical most of the time. Also the game is pretty easy, which hurts the replay value. The game also does not have many achivements or challenges to test your skill and keep you interested. The only thing I have found to make the game harder is playing with a keyboard instead of a mouse, since keyboards lack the speed and precision mice offer, but that makes it less enjoyable.In conclusion, for the price they have given the game is worth picking up, although I would love to see the franchise steer in the Rouge-like/Rouge-lite/PDS genre, with RPG elements. Personally I feel that the game will benefit a lot from the added depth from the PDS and RPG, which will make it a lot more interesting as well as add a lot of replayability."

It looked like a colorful, simple game we could enjoy together. And for the most part it ix. But there are glaring oversights that withold my recommendations.Many of the graphical effects obscure important things like enemy projectiles. You will get killed and wonder what hit you, because a cloud of cosmetic smoke blocked your ability to see.Second, there is no in game help, and with the number of collectibles it's very confusing to figure out what items you really need to be picking up. What do drumstricks/hamburgers do? Coins? How do I get more men? Why can I pick up some weapon upgrades but not others? What are these keys for? What are the stats of the weapons? How far can they be upgraded? etc.Lastly, this version does not enable cheats. There are 5 lives and no continues. Once you're dead, you go back to the start.

This mechanic takes away every bit of fun there is in freely moving around the screen, and sometimes the game will assingn a SafeZone That just indicates that in the next wave you are chained to a different spot on the screen.Now let's talk about the enemies, they usually have a pre-determined pattern meaning that the challenge is reduced to just sitting at the bottom of the screen avoiding slow projectiles that some enemies eventually shoot. And now for the other type of enemy there is: The Bosses, the game compensates what it lacks of difficulty by transforming it into boredom, bosses aren't hard at all even in the hardest of difficulties the game compensates that by using a INSANELY HUGE unnecessary waiting time, you have to wait until the boss comes out of the bottom of the screen, you have to wait for the boss to finish its extremely predictable attack pattern, you have to wait until the boss locks you in place by simuntaneously throwing♥♥♥♥♥♥at you that you can't possibly see until the projectile is not being covered by the chickens, by doing that the game breaks the 2 of the 3 basic ♥♥♥♥ing rules of every space shooter.- It makes you wait for the long time that the enemy is ""unattackable"" not letting you shoot it.- It hides projectiles from you.And then there are unlockables, things that require an insane amount of key collecting to unlock all fo the relevant important ones. Sometimes a chicken will glow with a golden sparkle, meaning that upon dying, that chicken will drop a single key that let's you unlock stuff in the menu, BUT 40 KEYS TO UNLOCK A HARDER DIFFICULTY IN THE GAME IS JUST COMPLETE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T.TL;DR-The game lacks freedom from the player to roam around the screen-Enemies are predictable-Boss battle are boring-Too many Unlockables"
