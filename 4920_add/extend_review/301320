Rollercoaster enthusiasts have been waiting a long time until a proper rollercoaster game. NoLimits actually uses the same software that real rollercoaster engineers use to create their screaming behemoths. How cool is that!?That being said, the game does have a learning curve. It will take a while to master, buts it’s one of those games that’s well worth the time in trying to learn! Even though the game is billed as a rollercoaster simulator, you can even build whole theme parks! The easiest way being able to import your own .3ds models into the game. If you can't find any you like online or you are not good at creating them yourself, there are tutorials online in how to use the games supports system to create buildings and objects. Do not feel overwhelmed at first for there are tutorials all over to help get a handle on the program.It may take some time to create an amazing coaster/park, but seeing these engineering marvels standing tall over your beautiful landscape is well worth it. I recommend any rollercoaster enthusiast to try the game out!"

I can't even get my head around everything yet. If you haven't played this game before, you need to be patient and don't expect to be able to bulid an amazing roller coaster 2 a few minutes after purchasing it. Read tutorials and start with the basics and then get into the more advanced tutorials. This game is not like the RollerCoaster Tycoon series at all. But overall the graphics and roller coasters are extremely life-like and if you know what to do is a great experience."

After optimizing the graphics settings to eliminate the minor stutter and judder (which obviously is a necessity for a complete immersion with the DK2), this simulator alone is worth the entire DK2 system. The massive community with user created tracks that keeps rolling in, the opportunity to design the coaster of your dream down to a molecular level, makes for a truly mindbending experience. This simulator is worth every penny, even without the DK2 system. It truly shines in every single aspect. Highly recommended!Pros :+ Level of creational flexibility+ Graphics/visual fidelity+ Realistic sound effects+ Physx/realism+ Huge community+ High frequency of shared custom created coasters+ Newly added DK2 support that is no more than ""mindbendingly"" immersiveCons :I honestly cannot think of any!10/10"

Also simulated are the fully functioning storage sheds and switch tracks which allow you to move trains into or out of circulation.If simply riding coasters isn't enough, you can also design, build, and ride your own custom coasters and share them with the community.All-in-all, this roller-coaster simulator is a must have for anyone interested in designing, building, and/or riding coasters from the comfort of their own home."

,Recommended,301320,29374280,Posted: 20 January,all,El Psy Congroo,"Honestly I'm upset with anyone who dares to give this masterpiece of a rollercoaster editing program a negative review. I've read most of them and it seems that they're complaining about either of these two things:- The VR triggers motion sickness- The editor is very complex and thus has a steep learning curve.I wouldn't have any issues with these two complaints, had they been properly built and supported with valid reasoning. However, that's not the case. Not at all.Of course the VR will trigger motion sickness for some people, because this is a rollercoaster simulator. If you have a weak stomach in terms of consistent movements, don't buy this game. This should have been obvious before you bought the game in the first place.Listen, if you're in doubt whether to buy this game or not, consider that this is a complex rollercoaster simulator that professional coaster designers use. Most of the community is very passionate about rollercoasters and standards are high. Don't let that scare you off though, instead watch a bunch of tutorials online if you find the editor to be too difficult. You can even choose which path you want to take. You can go with hand building, or math building. I personally could never really find myself within hand building, so i picked math building, which suits me so much better.This is a game with a steep learning curve, but with an amazing reward factor. When you've built your rollercoaster and you look at the finished product, you'll certainly be satisfied. No other rollercoaster simulator game can compare to this one when it comes to actively building rides and enjoying the beautiful graphics."

But while they all focus on different aspect of theme parks (RCT is more about management, Thrillville is more game play oriented), none of theme focused exclusively on what I like the most: roller coasters.With NoLimits 2, all that has changed.  Instead on focusing on multiple aspects of theme parks, NL2 is dedicated exclusively on roller coasters.  You build them, you ride them, and you share them. In fact, NL2 feels more like a development tools for roller coaster designers than a game simulation.Building coasters in other applications was always a little awkward.  With NL2, building coaster is so easy almost everybody can built a coaster within minutes.  You still need to understand a few basics concept (like blocks for example) and understand how to use the tools.  But when you understand these fundamental concepts,  you will be able to build incredible coasters.  From there, your imagination is the only limit.The included documentation provides just enough to get you going.  If you want more information, some excellent tutorial videos are available on YouTube.On a technical side, the application runs surprisingly well on laptops.  I had to set the resolution to 1280x720, but other than that, it works very well.  I can now build coaster when I am on the road.I have yet to experiment with scripting and scenery so I cannot comment on these features.  But all in all, I am very satisfied with this application.  And the more I play, the more I find that while building a coaster is easy, building a GOOD coaster is hard and challenging. And when I see what other people do, I know that I have a long way to go before I could build a good coaster."

I've tried nearly all the rollercoaster experiences that have come out and this game blows them all out of the water.  It's almost comical how much better and realistic this experience is.  The game comes with about 18 different coasters (all great) and running at stable framerates.  I've also downloaded a number of user-made coasters from the various fan exchange websites and from the workshop and many of these are fun and run great as well.  I haven't spent too much time in the editor program but it looks extremely robust and judging by the complexity of included coasters; very capable.One thing to keep in mind is the hardware requirements if using an Oculus.  I'm running an overlclocked i5  3570 with an OC'd GTX 980 and still need to play mostly on low settings to keep a stable 75fps.  The less complex coasters will play nicely on a lesser system but try the demo and give it a go.  Definitely my FAVORITE Oculus experience at the moment. Money well spent

But it is not just any roller coaster simulator... it is THE roller coaster simulator. You won't find it any more realistic as this and if you are a fan of roller coasters and super realistic simulation: get this game!PROs:- Strong engine with insane physics.- Many types of roller coasters.- Editor has anything you want and everything you'll ever need!- Supports external models, but has many of its own as well.- Graphics are gorgeous.- Many other roller coaster related features such as control panel for the coaster.CONs:- Config isn't really in-depth.- Not always on 60fps and thus some stuttering (and I have a GTX 765M, which pulls a lot).- This is mostly because of external models or too many coasters in a park.All in all: this is some serious strong software with great features. Any roller coaster fan who wants to build a good track, as in a real track not that Roller Coaster Tycoon stuff: buy this! You have complete freedom.EDIT: I wrote this review when having 4 hours. Currently I'm over 20 hours and looking back at this review I'd say nothing has changed. This is just great software! However, I still have to try out the Oculus Rift support."

It runs pretty well on less-than-optimal hardware (AMD Phenom II X4 955, no issues at all), and it even got a multi-core optimization update recently.  It's one of the few roller coaster simulators on Steam to take the realistic approach.The building tools are kind of dated and confusing.  I can't stress that enough.  It's not a good experience making coasters for this simulator.  It definitely takes tutorials and research to figure out how the park editor works.  There isn't a lot of documentation for this, either, that I could find.  Granted, I primarily got the app for riding coasters, not making them, so i gave up pretty quickly on building anything.  There is Workshop support, so you'll find a lot of coasters to ride.The VR controls are also non-existent.  You have to use the mouse and keyboard to navigate every bit of the game, from menu UIs to walking around parks.NoLimits 2 is worth the $40 if you have a Vive or Oculus or similar OSVR headset and want to experience realistic coaster rides.  I go into it every few weeks for 20-30 minutes at a time.  I also use it as a demo experience for my friends to try out roomscale VR."

It depends on your skill, me being me, I just mess around which is actually quite fun. However, when it comes to wanting to make a smooth, exciting realistic rollercoaster, it becomes difficult. Very difficult. This game is very time consuming in the way that it takes a long time to create a rollercoaster. You do get a feeling of accomplishment when you make a perfectly smooth coaster and it is the closest thing to building a rollercoaster virtually. It requires patience and skill to not get bored of this game. I don't have either of these. I'd play it every now and again, but not all day every day.  The actual state of the game is brilliant. I haven't come across a single bug, corruption or actually any issues at all other than my stupidity. Very neat and professional, finished and generally a really good game. Just be prepared to get bored of it if you're not the best coaster creator. It is harder than I expected. It is hard to create a smooth track, there's a lot of trial, error, deleting parts and rebuilding. If you REALLY want it, get it. If you don't really mind, don't bother. I would rate it: 9/10 for state and performance, 5/10 for coaster building because of the difficulty and 9/10 for simiulation (when you go on the ride). It's very impressive, just I regret buying it simply because I'm terrible at building on it."

The performance was much, much better than before (my system is somewhere between minimun and recommended) and the editor was also easy to get started with, thanks to a short but great tutorial.If you just want to ride some coasters, there are a lot of parks to download from the workshop, just make sure you have enough memory to run them (3GB RAM is not enough for the low quality version of the smiler, 4GB would have worked).Best rollercoaster sim ever, 10/10(I've played RCW1-2 (old), RCT1-4, TPS and NL1)"

NoLimits 2 is a Spline Editor, not a Piece Editor, you click where you want track, and the game will add track to go there.PROSExtremely RealisticExtremely EasyExtremely InnovativeCONSVery Hard to Add SupportsIf you put track piece A at X:0, and track B at X:-20, and you plan to go straight, and place it down, it will go back to 0."

This is better than any other roller coaster game I've played. I tried Theme Park Studio, but it didn't work well enough for me. RCT3 is fun, but the design part of roller coasters isn't detailed enough, and you can hardly make anything realistic. But this is perfect. Not only can you be realistic (and actually stay withing good g-forces) but you can be extremely imaginative (or boring, if that's your thing). If I want to make a typical Arrow looper, I can. If I want to make a ginormous strata coaster that's 15,000 feet long, I can still do that. There are endless possibilities.So many new features have been added since NoLimits 1. The design interface is so much cleaner and modern. The track very rarely needs adjusting and moving like in the first game. You just hit ""Depump Vertices"" and it automatically smooths (unlike in NL1 where smoothing was never enough). Things like the g-force and speed combs are really helpful because you can design in comfortable constraints instead of testing every element.The graphics are also much better. I found NL1 graphics to be somewhat jagged and even blocky sometimes. NL2 has pristine graphics and everything is much more realistic. When placing trees, you can count the leaves individually. NL1 had trees that were very bunched together. Terra-forming is a lot better now. Terrain rises in a circular pattern instead of in a square pattern.And of course, there are many more coaster types. 4D, suspended swinging, and wing are just a few of the new coaster types available.10/10 - Perfect coaster designer. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of roller coasters."

,Recommended,301320,24638543,"Posted: 31 July, 2016",all,BailsBach,"Probably the most realistic coaster designer I've ever played with. Yes, I said designer - even the physics are realistic. You're able to ride, design / build, and control. And yes, I said control. You're given access to a control panel which lets you control the ride from just ""automatic"" (which is the AI controlling it, or custom scripts), ""blocks"", which let's you control segments of the track and release the coaster manually. Or, full manual, which is the hardest of them all. Try to play with 3 coasters at once, it's impossible! Despite people commenting about a ""steep learning curve"", the editor is quite simple and is quite easy to learn once you've gotten yourself ""rolling"" (pun intended). I'm not very good yet, but with a bit of practice I suppose I'd be able to design many great coasters.Note -You're able to import custom models, sounds, scripts and more, but even the vanilla version is good enough to keep you excited for a good, long set of hours!Realism: 9.5/10Customisability: 9.5/10Overall: 9/10"

If you do - great, go buy it now!There's a lot of VR experiences I can handle, but there are also a lot that make me sick if I'm not careful. If you like me need to be a bit careful and can't just take it all, I would not for a second recommend this game. I tried around half of a simple, straightforward, up and down rollercoaster ride (maybe 30 seconds) before I was sweatting profusely and had to tear the headset off to keep from throwing up.It should be said that I LOVE real world rollercoasters. Up, down, corkscrews, loops, twirls I've done them all and love them in real life... but in VR it would seem I just can't handle it. The high speed turns with no mitigation or control are just too hard.You can see this as a review of VR rollercoasters in general, from the point of someone who has some problems with VR nausea. Not more than most of my friends who has tried my Oculus though. I don't believe this is a particularly poor implementation, which is why I mention it as a general thing.Reviewing VR is so very difficult, because there is such an intensely physical and individual component to the experience.So all I'm saying is Caveat Emptor: VR Buyer Beware.TLDR; Purely from VR standpoint probably stay away from rollercoasters in general, unless you have no issues with simulation sickness ever.PS: I feel super bad giving the devs a ""No"" because of something they can't control. But it's still important info for potential buyers. How we discuss and review VR games are some of the issues we'll have to iron out as VR matures."

It sufferes from the same overly copmplex building system, that as soon as you see it, it makes you want to stop playing, and after spending only a few minuets trying to build a coaster, it makes you want to pull your hair out. Also while riding the premade stuff, I nticed that the sounds needed more work. The sounds that the water made, didn't sound like flowing water should at all, and the sounds of the coasters, just seemd to keep getitng louder and louder, until it was a roar in my ears, regardles of what speed the coaster was actually going at."
