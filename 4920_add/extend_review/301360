,Recommended,301360,10732560,"Posted: 23 June, 2014",all,Crazy Kagge,"KillFunYeah is an action filled 2D shooter with great personality and fast paced gameplay. The game was created by the extremly talented YouTube channel thunderhumor (https://www.youtube.com/user/ThunderHumor). Speaking of youtubers if you read this review and want to help this game frow just comment on some big Youtubers channel (for example: PewDiePie, tobuscus or markiplier). In the game you have control over three abilities attract,deflect and freeze. Atract frant you the ability to make a kind of ""homing"" projektile wich you can launch at enemies. Deflect grants you a shielt that fires the ensmies bullet back at them with double damage. And freeze freezes your bullet so you can launch them when for example a enemy approaches (I'll make a KFY guide when i have some free time). The only bad thing i can find with this game is that Ther's no tutorial whatsoever so it's hard to learn and there's still not a lot of people playing."

Its the most fun game i found, I would play more if there were more players to play with.The game is abandoned and what i think is if the developers were to work on the game to add more stuff. Maybe we can play once again.And im sure alot of people are just like me, They love the game. But no one is playing it.If we can get alot of people to play. Then we can bring the game back maybe, Maybe. Maybe not..But its up to the developers."

It took forever to even join a game and when I did there were two players for a 10 player map.The game idea is great but its just not worth it if you expect this to be a large community.Also after buying the game I only got 1 hour of actually play time before I had to pay agian so because of this its a negative review.Just don't buy this game.

The developers are also online a few times and by then just about everyone plays so yeah. minus point for no one creating sir cockonface mcgee

,Not Recommended,301360,34277722,Posted: 16 August,all,Scrubbadubba,"It's fun the first couple of maybe 2 hours. Then it gets stale, repetetive and not enjoyable. There is no multiplayer cause no one is ever online and the cutomization is hard to use. I wish I didn't play this for 6 hours so I could refund it"
