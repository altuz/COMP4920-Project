Even though it may be the weakest of all Hanako titles so far, it definitely is interesting and entertaining enough to present you 6-7 hours of playtime.Janet Bhaskar is a freshman in Brooke College, Memphis. She is an introverted young woman who never dated before, and agrees to go on a date with young jock Bradley Dalton to appease her roommate, Vanessa. They go on a pretty much text book date without much attraction and got hit by a furious storm in the middle of the night while they were trying to go back. Bradley’s car gets busted in the middle of nowhere and phones do not pick any signal, yet luckily Janet manages to spot the lights of a mansion nearby. They decide to ask for help, and spend the night there if necessary. Unbeknownst to them, they may never leave...This pretty otome game feels like a cross over betweenRocky Horror Picture Showand a random episode ofX-Files, with many enjoyable cultural and science fiction references. I must confess that both the narrative writing, and the concept choice is way better than I expected it to be. Characters are vivid and interesting as typologies, yet considering it is a short VN, there hasn't been much space for actual character depth. Janet is well developed as a character, yet none of the romance options are spectacular. We observe some interesting hooks without much in game development. The ending is somewhat cheesy and predictable too, with a taste for ""all for one, one for all.""Gameplay is pretty generic, with description to read and choices to make to follow one of the character paths. The choice option though, comes with a wiring mini game for you to enjoy. It's like a pipe game, but with wires. It is cute and presents a casual feeling for your relaxation.My one annoyance would probably be the art work and CGs used in the game. I usually do not care much for graphic quality but most of the pictures felt like taken from amateur deviantart pages, with odd disproportions and an obvious lack of care for the coloring. Actual character animations were not that bad, just not attractive, especially compared to Hanako's other game titles.Oh, well. Not every game in the genre is a masterpiece. Still, here is an otome VN with 5 different characters and 11 endings harbored with brain scratchers. The story itself comes in to conclusion, sure, but the setting itself feels well-built enough to be visited by Hanako's future games.

As with all otome games some routes will be less enjoyable than others depending on your tastes but what I liked best was the mystery-solving aspect, getting new scraps of information in every route to piece together the backstory and figure out what was going on. If anything the romance kinda sticks out considering that the protagonist barely knows any of the guys and the game takes place over just a few short days, though again that's handled better in some routes than others.The protagonist is a positive point for me. She has a good design and personality rather than just being a blank slate, and like the plot bits of her backstory are revealed as you play the multiple routes, which was a really interesting idea.The little puzzles for picking dialogue options weren't really bad, just pointless, and the game could stand to be slightly cheaper imo. More variation in the designs for the love interests would be good too, but sadly that's true of most entires in the genre. But if you like a bit of sci-fi/fantasy with your dating sim or just something a little different then this is more than just another paint-by-numbers otome."
,Recommended,301380,32231654,Posted: 6 June,all,wolfwomansilver,"Date WarpVisual NovelI bought this game awhile ago and never really got to playing it. It started it, but the art didn’t really appeal to me. However, now that I actually gave it a chance I’ve gotta say this is a solid visual novel. It has romance, mystery and science fiction and a story that makes up for the less polished artwork.The characters that you can romance each have their own backstories and reasons doing what they are doing. They have a variety of types: sweet and innocent, lecherous and clever, genteel and polite, rough and tumble and the boy next door. There are good endings and bad endings. There is a final ending, but you have to complete all other routes to get there.It’s pretty typical on gameplay. It does have the added twist of a fairly simple puzzle you have to do before you pick your answer. Once you’ve picked an answer you can skip the puzzle and pick that answer the next time you play through without having to redo that puzzle. Its a little twist, but as the puzzles are the same type all the way through it isn’t much of a challenge.The artwork gets a little awkward at times (proportions are off), but it isn’t a total loss. Some of the CGs are higher quality than others.But it’s the story that really gets you going. You are warped to another world and then stuck inside a house with 5 strangers. As you play you get to know one of the guys and find out the secret of what is going on. Your choices will impact your ending.I’d say that for a $10 price tag this is a solid addition to my ever-growing steam library. I don’t think I will play it again, but I got 5 hours of enjoyment out of it and $2 an hour isn’t bad.Recommended"

This VN definitely deserves more attention!

,Recommended,301380,13589507,"Posted: 25 December, 2014",all,Zhuinden (人^▽')～,"DATE WARP is a visual novel with multiple paths and endings (11 endings, to be exact - 2 endings for each romance path, and a final ""true ending"" is unlocked once the others have been reached), created by Kanako Games, mostly known for the game LONG LIVE THE QUEEN, but also the creator of ""MAGICAL DIARY"".If that doesn't sell you the game to you instantly, I'm surprised. LLTQ is amazing in its optimization for min-maxing while also providing enough room to successfully complete the game in multiple ways, while MD was a well-written dating sim.If you've played Magical Diary, you possibly know that the characters written by Kanako tend to have actual personalities and depth, which makes the chatter of the characters quite enjoyable. That is true for this game as well, as the primary focus of the game is its story.The plot of DATE WARP itself is interesting enough that you'll possibly end up trying to get every ending, not just so that you'll unlock the achievements like I did (well, I had already seen all the endings while my friend was playing, so my playtime is an indicator of me fast-forwarding rather than actual game length.)I don't feel like going into detail because, you know, *everything is a spoiler*, but overall, after seeing every ending, it makes perfect sense, despite being MINDF***.I sure hope you'll take your time to check it out. I did play through the game with fastforward just to put it up on my profile as an achievement showcase, after all.p.s.: LINDS is entertaining, I'd almost buy the game just to get to romance him, haha."

,Recommended,301380,25796777,"Posted: 1 October, 2016",all,niX,"This is a beautiful and artistic visual novel. Hell, I didn't even care about the romantic parts of it.. because the story is just so intriguing. Well written, and very complicated - but also simple, once you finally understand it all. I'm not really even a fan of time travel, but it really worked well for this VN. I won't get into a synopsis about the story.. I think this is one that's much better if you play and figure it out yourself.Love, devotion, sacrifice, the moral dilemma of right vs wrong.. mystery, romance, sci-fi. This VN has it all. It's very thought-provoking and deep, and reaches you on an emotional level. It really makes you think, and I think that's important. The romantic aspect of it is very PG - allowing you to focus more on the story, which I think is very positive.ProsLikeable characters, and a great variety. Even the characters I didn't like were interesting. Janet is very naive and innocent.. but also very strong headed and a great protagonist.Intriguing and a very deep and involved story.The ""true"" ending (or at least what I would consider true), makes you actually feel happy about going through the effort of going through all of the other endings up to that point. Although most endings aren't happy, figuring out the ""mystery"" and getting the best ending is very worth it.Pretty long VN. For the 10.99 it costs, you'll get your money's worth. Assuming you don't just skip through the dialogue to make the decisions.If you DO skip through dialogue just to get choices (for achievements), they're all pretty easy to get if you follow a guide.ConsThe wire mini game. Worst part of this game. Why connect wires to make choices? Why not let me just make the choices? Maybe they figured it would add more of a sci-fi aspect, but I found it to be a pain.Can be a little bit confusing. You really have to be paying attention, or be interested in actually caring about it. I wouldn't recommend taking long breaks in between playing this, otherwise you might forget or get even more confused.A little bit more added to the other endings would have been nice. Most endings are very similar with slight variations. This feels a little bit rushed.. reading the text tells you black and white what happened, but having a bit more detail or an ending gallery image or an elaboration would have been nice.Overall, 8/10. Would recommend."

It also has a non trivial sci-fi element that's interesting.Overall, go for it for a cute romance / choose your own adventure game, not if you're looking for puzzle."

,Recommended,301380,23531189,"Posted: 12 June, 2016",all,NeppyLeet,"I had played Date Warp many years ago (possibly, the summer after its release) and I was so involved with the story that I had my boyfriend (now husband) play it. Both of us thought it was a charming and interesting experience. Seeing it on Steam, I was eager to buy and play it again, and I wasn't disappointed. Only two complaints come into my mind: 1) Some of the CGs have incorrect proportions. The two at the end of the actual ending are beautifully done, so I believe they may have been added later on. 2) The game was much shorter than I remember. I was staying up at night, reading through and enjoying until the wee hours of the night. However, this time, I had a day off and played through the game in its entirety before I had dinner. Neither of these two things ruined the game for me.For people just getting into Otome games, this is a very warm welcome. The characters are fleshed out well, including yourself. The music doesn't intrude and helps set the mood of the scene. There's a little mini-puzzle before each decision, leaving you to solve it before you pick that option for the first time. (Any time after that, you can choose to skip the puzzle to pick the same option.) This helped me a LOT because I will sometimes click through a choice, selecting the wrong option. There's a meter in the beginning to assist you along the path you'd prefer. There's even a final route to unlock after seeing all the other routes!Not only have I recommended this game to friends before, but I continue to do so now. Short, sweet, and well worth the money."

A lot could have been done better, and the puzzle sections seemed fairly useless, but it's worth a look if it's your kind of game.  It keeps you playing until you've reached all the endings!"

What you learn depends on who you choose to spend time with.  You'll definitely need more than one playthrough to see the big picture.  That's a really nice touch - not only do you have a new romance each time you play, but also a different and partly exclusive privileged point of view.The art goes from mostly harmless to not bad.  Despite not looking terribly professional, I found it endearing and never distracting.My romance, at least, had plenty of juicy double-entendre, innuendo and a satisfying cli- uh... high point... without ever straying above a PG rating.  I appreciated this classy approach, which was typical of the story as a whole.The writing is very good.  At no point did I feel compelled to stop reading or skip past dialogue, or roll my eyes at unbelievable speech.  The characters were the usual suspects, but the stereotypes were fleshed out enough to be worth sticking around to watch and interact with.Each choice you make comes with an untimed and easy pipe-matching minigame.  I know it sounds gratuitous, but it helped me mull over the previous events while consciously making my decision.The opening song (you'll have to play past the intro to hear it) is epic.  PLEASE tell me it's on iTunes or will be in the near future...In brief, easily worth full price.

For the most part this VN was kind of slow and it let you take everything in but once the ending hit you barely had a second to comprehend everything that was happening. This may just be a problem with the path I got. The only other problem I had was with the choice system. There are a lot of choices to be made but all of them are chosen with a simple mini-game that is very much like pipe dream. It felt very tacked on and unneeded.

The scenario is really well put together - the sci-fi elements make internal sense as far as I can see, and the visual novel format has been used to its full potential.The characters all start out a little like stereotypes (you have Linds, the mad scientist, Alben the emo trash, Bradley the boy next door etc) but over the course of the routes they all become decent characters with multiple layers. I really love how the story-telling works between routes - there's a clear consistency to it. The protagonist acts based on the information she has at hand, and although a lot of the text is repeated through routes it has been altered where need be. I know this seems like a weird thing to fangirl about, but I appreciate good writing and this game has it.I love how the endings (excluding the True End) cannot clearly be defined as 'good' or 'bad'. Some of them pack quite the emotional punch. Others are more of a cliff-hanger...Some are definitely stronger than others, as a handful feel rather rushed.I really enjoyed the puzzle mechanic, it made the choices seem far more significant and made me feel more involved in the story. It's a clever little technique I haven't seen before.The art is not the best, you can see that in the screenshots, but the story was good enough that I could overlook it.

It's rewarding finding out more bits of information about the characters and mysteries as you go through all the routes.The endings. Obviously, I don't want to spoil anything here but I will say that the majority of the endings aren't typical otome game endings. Even the good ends don't necessarily end on a 'happily ever after.' This surprised me a lot at first but I soon got used to it and ended up enjoying it (some endings felt a bit too open but that might have been because they were my fave characters and I wanted more).The puzzles. I actually really enjoyed the puzzle feature when you had to make a choice. It's something I haven't seen before and it made me actually think about the choice before I made it.The grown-up feel and the protag. Even though the protag was inexperienced in the love department, she felt like a university student. I'm so used to playing as a high school student in these kinds of games so it was refreshing to play as someone older who isn't afraid of flirting (Linds' route was fab for this).The artwork is generally good but not as good as the more recent hanako games. The sprites used throughout the game were really good, some of the CGs looked a bit awkward though.ConsIf I had to be picky, it would have been nice to see more CGs in the character routes. Also, the game was quite repetitive but that's to be expected in games like these because you have to replay conversations so you can pick different options.All in all, I enjoyed playing Date Warp and would recommend this game."

It is quite clear that this wasn't drawn by a professional. Secondly , there are a lot of plot holes. Several questions are not answered even if you unlock the true ending. Of course this is a story about time travel so some plot holes are inevitable but I still feel that the author took it too far , combining science fiction and magical elements but without really explaining anything. I don't want to spoil the story to anyone who wants to play it, but whoever has already bought it knows what I'm talking about.Thirdly , this game feels a little short for the 10 euros you have to spend in order to buy it, but at least there are multiple endings so it has some replay value.That being said, I do not regret buying this game because as I mentioned before, it is enjoyable. Some of the characters are adorable and the story can be interesting if you ignore all the plot holes. I also liked the little puzzles they added every time you had to choose an option in the story, it is a nice, original idea for visual novels.In conclusion , I recommend this game if you're a hardcore visual novel fan , willing to overlook the few problems it has."

You'll have to find out yourself.The art style is crisp and cute, though you can see differences between it and Hanako Games' later titles. The music selection is mood-fitting, and the story is well-written. Anovelfeature is that, instead of merely selecting dialogue choices, you play a minigame which is similar to a maze of wires, which you need to connect in order to 'power up' the dialogue options. It doesn't entirely feel fitting, but it's certainly a neat distraction.All in all, it's a game that will keep you guessing.

I finished all the routes in a couple of hours, though I skipped a lot of the shared dialogue—there's a lot shared between routes, since the central plot remains the same. That's one thing that bugged me a bit, though that's common in visual novels, I've noticed. However, having played Magical Diary, a later Hanako Games title, I can say the way the repeated dialogue was handled in that felt a bit less dry, since there were more ways to explore in the game.Some of the art was better than other examples...Linds and Nathaniel tended to look good, but the art was iffy in a lot of the CGs, and some of the reactions for characters looked off. I don't mind art as much as other people, so this wasn't a big deal for me, nor was I bothered by the lack of voicing.You choose your options with a puzzle game where you build a circuit through some twisted wire to build a path to the option you want to select. I liked this, especially since you can skip the puzzle if you've already solved it for an option that you want to select again.The way the plotlines culminate in the final playthrough was quite good, but I feel like there was a lot that could've been done better, such as it leaving me wanting to know more about some of the characters and the universe, but in a sort of empty way, not in an excited one.Overall, this is a good game, but painfully short and with too much repeated (though, if you play through the whole game, you could argue that's part of the point with regard to the plot.) It left me wanting more than it could give me.I bought it for 75% off, leaving it below $3, which I thought was worth it. Would I pay $9.99 for it? No. Is it still worth playing? Yeah, if you don't pay $9.99 for it!I'd give it a 7/10, maybe a 6.0 to 6.5 if I'm being harsh."

,Recommended,301380,31814384,Posted: 17 May,all,Galaxy Eyes,"This is seriously one of the most severely underrated visual novels I've ever seen. The writing is strong, the characters are flawed and complex yet still likeable, and the sci-fi/mystery aspect is super interesting, putting a nice twist on the typical otome genre. I really enjoyed playing each route to unravel the larger overall story. I also really liked how the protagonist herself gets a fleshed out character and backstory instead of being a completely blank slate; she has so much personality, I felt like I was unraveling her story too. The true ending was strong and it felt like everything got wrapped up nicely. Date Warp is a very enjoyable game overall and its pacing and length feels just right -- it's not super short but it doesn't feel like it drags on and on forever either -- which I think is pretty hard to do in dating sims like this where you need to play each route to get the full story. On a more minor note, I thought the music in the game was very good too, it was very fitting and atmospheric throughout. I like how it was mostly electronic, it really added to the sci-fi vibe of the game.I also learned that the version of this game on steam is the updated silver edition or whatever with  some new writing and an updated epilogue - I think that it's really cool for the developers to care enough to go back and do that for an older game of theirs. Achievements and trading cards are also a nice bonus.The only real downside is perhaps some of the CG art for events looks a little rough around the edges, and the fact that you need to complete puzzles to select your dialogue options is kind of weird, but neither is a big detractor by a long shot. Thankfully, after you've already done a puzzle for one dialogue option, you'll never have to do it again -- a nice anti-frustration feature. The art overall is solid and the game is fantastic. It's another strong title from Hanako Games that hasn't gotten nearly as much attention as their other works."

It's art style isn't the best but it isn't the worst. My only complaint on the art style is that there is little drawn scenes and the ones that are drawn aren't the best and are sometimes reused. But it honestly doesn't effect the game too much. The story is pretty good and I believe this game takes about a max of 5 hours to finish, but I'm not too sure. The choice puzzle mechanic is quite intresting, and unique to this game, the puzzle arent too hard to complete but makes for an intresting mechanic.

Yanno, an actual agent in the story, an investigator solving mysteries! Instead she's just a victim in a mystery and her her destiny is controlled by the virtual strangers she's met. Not what I wanted or expected, and I kept playing hoping it would get better.The art style wasn't the most polished, but art isn't the end all be all of visual novels. You get used to it.The characters were fairly flat. As you progressed through multiple routes you got to learn a little bit more about them.The most fulfilling route was Lind's because it actually half-heartedly attempted to answer the questions I was actually curious about. But the big questions about each character still remained unanswered and vague.The true end was pretty unsatisfying. There was more mysteries to be solved. Honestly I think Rafeal or Linds would have been better MCs than our herione. For all that she had a personality and opinions, she was not an agent of her own destiny and was embarrassed when she tried to be.Gameplay-wise it's also fairly boring. There's a game to play when you get to choices which was cute at first, but it's also buggy (I spent 10 minutes on a puzzle because I was convinced that this game wouldn't include an unsolvable puzzle, but a quick search proved that it had happened before, so... meh). The 'boy like you' meter looks more like a moral index and I genuinely thought I was playing to be a good/bad person and not falling in love with this dude (I was polite?? so now I love him???), so that was unclear. Once you're set on a route, the difference between endings is literally a SINGLE choice. Once you've seen one ending you've almost seen them all. And really, all of them are not worth it.

It's actually more dramatic, even tragic than you might expect. The characters are well-written and three-dimensional; the protagonist, Janet, is especially believable. Incidentally, it's what you might call an 'otome' game, in that 'you' are female and you get to romance a number of young men. It's actually quite sweet at times.The gameplay isn't much more than a Choose Your Own Adventure. When you come to a choice, you play a little pipe-rotation minigame; It's kind of a gimmick, but it doesn't come up enough to overstay its welcome. (If you've done a choice before, you can 'skip' it, though when you skip you can only choose choices you've chosen before!) The graphics are fine, though some of the portraits do occasionally seem a bit amateurish. The incidental music is fine; the theme song is actually pretty catchy. There are eleven endings; the ""true"" ending is only available by first getting all the other endings. It's not TOO difficult to figure out how to get them.

If you've played other releases by the folks behind this one I'll warn you that the writing is a bit shakier than it is in some of their more well-known efforts, you can definitely tell it's an older work, but it still tells a fun story in an interesting world. All the guys ended up being likable to me by the end, even Alben who spends much of the game being a short-tempered jerk at least has a good reason for why he'sreallyon-edge during the events of the game. One which you learn in every route and he cools down after the reveal of, this isn't a case of 'You MUST play this one's route to ever see them as more than a dillweed!'One thing I really like about it is that the different routes don't just show you a bigger picture of the guy you've chosen to focus on this time, they each show you a bigger picture ofJanet. Say, if you play Alben's route first you'll get some hints about something bad happening to her a year before, but then you play Linds' and find out the actual details. It keeps her from getting boring.The one thing I didn't really like was the minigames for selecting conversation choices. It just didn't feel like it added anything (other than showing off what I do realize is an impressive bit of coding for the Ren'py engine) and it would be nice if there was a choice in the options to turn them off all together instead of just getting to skip ones you've already done (if you're choosing the same option again). There are a few choices that're big enough that it could work as showing Janet's mind being tangled up with confusion she needs to push through to decide what to do, but things like deciding whether to be polite or pushy about getting into the house aren't things she should need time to detangle her thoughts for."

The mini-game that plays during choices could have been cut out entirely and the gameplay would lose nothing. Some of the CGs look ridiculous and can ruin the mood of some scenes. For example, one CG involving Bradley was supposed to create a shocking and suspenseful atmosphere.
