,Not Recommended,301460,12252196,"Posted: 26 September, 2014",all,Steelrain🎃,"Before I start, I'd like to ask that you read my review before downvoting it instantly just because it's negative. With that said, I don't think that ESJ:GC is aterriblegame, just unfinished, and its current content is more like what you'd expect in a minor DLC or free update for the original game.But first, let's start with the good parts. The soundtrack ranges from good at worst to amazing at best, which isn't surprising as the composer is the same as the first game's. The story and one-liners are about as quirky as in the first game, and you may or may not see that as a good thing, although for me personally the novelty of butt jokes, battlepopes and robot strippers has worn off a bit. Most of the few levels present were decently designed, with some skillfully timed jumps required at parts.Now we get to the bad parts. One thing that I noticed right off the bat was that the ability to ground pound had been removed. Considering the original game had 4 total moves (left, right, jump, ground pound), this change is pretty significant. There's no way to get rid of missiles now, you can only jump around them, and the screen can get ridiculously cluttered with them unless if you purposely suicide after each checkpoint. I also found myself taking too long to fall at times and dying because of it, where in the original game I could have just ground pounded downwards.Some platforming elements from the first game are either used only a few times, like the sticky walls, or not at all, like the wings. There's only one ""boss"", and all you have to do is avoid his attacks for around a minute. There are only a few varieties of enemies present, you could probably count them all on one hand.These are all minor problems compared to the main issue, however: the game is just too short. I'm not particularly good at platformers, and even though I died several times, I was able to beat the entire game in slightly over an hour, getting all achievements in my first playthrough. There's no replay value at all. There is an included level editor, but this seems to be the dev's way of saying ""this is all I'm doing, you finish the game"". It seems to me like the dev didn't want to release these levels as free DLC for ESJ like he has in the past, but instead slapped a level designer on it and called it a new game.I can't really complain about the price personally, since I bought this for 27 cents, but I know there are people who will want to buy it at full price. My word of advice: don't. It's basically a small level pack disguised as a sequel. Ask yourself if you think $5 is worth an hour, tops, of entertainment. You can make your money go much further than that on Steam. Of course, if you have a coupon or it's on sale, feel free to go for it if you want to burn away an hour of your time.In conclusion, ESJ:GC has the potential to become just as good as ESJ if more (free) content is added, but as it is now, it's just a skeleton of a game that happens to have great music.If you scrolled past all that just looking for a number, here it is:4/10"

According to ESJ developer Yazarmediagroup, “It runs faster mostly, but this was done by overhauling a lot of the ESJ code.” Yazarmediagroup adds, “Now I'll work on a level pack & some extra features (generated dungeons & a level editor are on my mind) & release those as DLC. That will bring it up to the full size of ESJ.”If you’ve never played the first installment, skip this and buy the original Electronic Super Joy instead.

Groove City has been rebuilt by the Boogie Brothers, and everything was wonderful until Dr. Swinger stole JoJo the Robot Stripper's Laser Nipples. Here, we enbark on a journey with Pope Borris the Super Sexy as we take down Dr. Swinger and retreive the Laser Nipples.The platforming mechanics are really spot on. If you come here from an intense Electronic Super Joy background (You played the first game), the controls make you feel right at home. Even though it is shorter than the original Electronic Super Joy, I find the difficulty much harder than the original (Ol' Ball and Chain ain't got nothin on this). I find myself missing the ""Slam"" ability, because I use it for much more than taking out enemies. I use it as a stablizer when I'm going to fast, or to immediately land on a platform. I miss this mechanic, but the game itself is wonderful.EnV is back with his amazing soundtrack, and I have to say, I can't stop playing this game to listen to the music. Sometimes I just launch the game, sit on a certain level, and listen to the music and not move. It's that good.The only complaint I have about this game is that it's too short.Speaking of soundtrack, the store description describes of including EnV's new EP and the game OST in the game. It was actually a marketing text mistake, for the EP realeases in several days as a separate DLC. Do not let that throw you off, haha. It already thrown a lot of people off."

The game offers about an hour of gameplay and to me it didn't really feel as challenging or rewarding as the first one. If you are looking for a game like this I would recommend playing the first ESJ before this. I prefer the leaderboard system in the first game where top times were your goal and not so much getting a ton of points.The level design didn't feel as fluent as it did in the first game and I feel like a lot of the stars where just placed randomly with no real reason behind it other than getting more points. This is my personal opinion and I won't say it's a bad system but I simply found trying to get got times and top spots in the first game more fun.You should only really buy it if you loved the first one, but just as a warning, don't expect to get that much real gameplay  out of this one unless you like collecting stars. You will most likely get all of the achievement fairly easily and beat the game in just one sitting.As a conclusion I think the music is still as groovy and perfect as it was in the first one and there has been a lot of updates to the visual style but the lack of new mechanics and the short time that it takes to complete it brings it down. Nevertheless, in the end I did enjoy it because I love these kind of games :)- Liam"

With the backlog of games for me to get through i ended up putting off this game until 3/24/16. Completed the game in 45 minutes with 100% of achievements, realised the only incentive to stray off the path was for a few achievements that were so generalised they could be achieved without trying. So if i bothered to stop collecting anything i could have finished this in half the time. There is no replayability unless you want to use the level editor, but this aspect alone doesn't give warrent to how empty it ended up being. Unless you can get this game for less then it's retail price, then don't bother. Otherwise, it would have been a fun game if there was enough content to get me invested.--Pros--more music by EnV!npc banter and level design--Cons--The game is REALLY short.Unless going for achievements, collectablesare pointless and only count for a score.Removed abilities and simplified gameplay to just jumping.Only boss fight is short and unsatisfying.Secrets are pointless unless going for score maximisation.--Afterthought--I really wanted to enjoy this game, i have been in the mood for a good platformer for a while now and was just getting into this game by time i beat it. If it had something to work for such as concept art, creater notes, or litterally anything other then the 8 achievements i obtained in a single/my first run would give this game some incentive to keep playing.Even going for a top score is pointless when there is a cap on the points you can get.

The gameplay revolves around a very simple jumping mechanic that are generally used to platform and dodge things. You basically do the same in every level, only difference being the amount of things coming at you, and in a few levels you`ll have to hurry up. The game is also super short with only 13 levels. Its in fact so short that when I were done with the thirteen levels, I started looking around for a place to continue the game in a second part. In my first playthrough I finished the game in a good hour/hour and a half.All in all its a very short game with basic, repetitive gameplay, along with good graphics and music. With such a small price tag I`d say the game is worth the money.If you`d like a cheap platformer to kill some time with, this game is a good bet. Otherwise its a game you won`t mind skipping.*EDIT: Seems like this game isn`t very playable in 60 fps. Certain parts are nearly impossible unless your refresh rate is 30 fps."

It's on by default and since the options don't toggle it's there forever. So throughout the game I was continuously being distracted by replays of someone on my friends list doing the level themselves. Given how many times they were dying (and then jumping in place repeatedly, then just standing there hopelessly) it's clear they were hating it as much as I was.Since the ghost is a less opaque copy of your own sprite it's very easy to get it mixed up when trying to do split second timed jumps and this was a continuous problem for me.I don't recommend buying it. Even on sale. At the very most this should have been an extra world for the first game."

I wouldn't even pay $2 for it.The only reason I bought this game was so I could get EnV's music, and it doesn't even ""come with"" it. It's all in the game files and I can't listen to them sepparately.The level and game design are poor. Far too many times did it introduce a new concept, obstacle, or enemy, without any form of tutorial or explanation and I would die and be set back and have to replay the annoying parts of the level.There seemed to be no point in collecting points. They just got in the way, and obstructed the game for no apparant reason.Everything on the level is either black or white. So it is far too difficult to differentiate various objects on the level. Far too many times did I run into an enemy not knowing they were there, or jump past an object I should have landed on.The menus are practically non-existant, and what is there is ridiculously clumsy to navigate. There's no way to quit the game, I had to press alt+F4.What jokes I did see didn't amuse me at all. The constant moan whenever I respawn or walked past a checkpoint meerly served to infuriate me and to encourage me to avoid them altegether (punishing me in the long-run). The constant reference to sex, and various other ""adult themes"" came off as purely imature and as a result it felt like the game was targetted at 12 year olds.I get the distinct feeling that the developer(s) didn't even play the game before releasing it, let alone have it tested.Perhaps the reason I'm not enjoying this game is because I haven't played the previous game.

The price is fair, it's got replay value for the secrets and for speed running/high scores. I'd recommend this to anybody who likes platformers or liked the first ESJ.TL;DR- I've gone through the game 3 times and would recommend it because sex jokes, fun platforming and EDM.

The obstacles are very heavy on tiring chains of instant jumps, so these few enemies managed to overstay their welcome in a 30-minute game. It's kind of sad. I would probably enjoy these levels if they were between other stuff, but this way there's just too much repetition for my taste.There's also been some bugs. The final boss fight feels half-baked - there's invisible death fields and the cloud platforms have strange hitboxes. There was also a game-breaking issue with screen resolution, but it has fortunately been fixed.The text has been stripped (ha ha) down in comparison, and while the absurd innuendo follows the spirit of the first game, there's much less of the cheerful ""Hey! Keep it up! Groovy! ..."" comments that created its atmosphere, so it feels like the party you're traversing has moved from enthusiasm to a drunken lull.If this game contained the stomp move and more variation in obstacles, I'd love it, but this way it falls flat.

I wanted to love this game more than reality, but it fell far short of that.  The visuals are improved but tend to be repetitive at times. The soundtrack holds up the standard which is always a good thing. They added secret areas and new enemies. The good stops there. They took away everything that made the original so fun. The smash was removed. This resulted in some of the worst gameflow in a 2D platformer I have ever played when going straight from the original. The worst thing that somehow made it into the game is when you hit your head on a wall, you stick to it for a while. This even more interrupts the gameflow. It is harder, but in very cheap ways. The enemies just go faster and there are more of them. The controls are extremely unresponsive at points. It just felt like it was made cheaply and pushed to meat a deadline. It is short among all things. About 13 levels that only take time because the controls are unresponsive. It has the WORST hit boxes and level designs I have ever seen in a 2D platformer. 3/10"

The base game was good, but I found that the problems that it presented could have been stomped out in this DLC. Overall, it's basically the same game but scaled down, basically to the point where it's just a new added-on world. What I love is, of course the music, everything else really falls by the wayside, like if your favorite songs got put over the original Mario game; the great music is what supports the tired, punishing game. It got to the point about halfway in I just wanted to keep playing just so I could get more of the music- just like ESJ itself. If I was you I would skip it- get the soundtrack.BUT...WHY????Well, I'll tell you why- the game is pixelated- you must know it is all about that sweet moosic PUSS! If you really want to get it, do it, if you enjoyed the slow pacing of the original (because you get instakilled by anything that hits you harder than a mild gust of wind), have it, and if you liked the music, the EDM music, mind you, you'll also like this. I just found it disappointing the dev didn't make the game more engaging, and the music will get tiresome after a while, because when you think you escaped- NOPE! MISSILE!WHY DO YOU HATE THAT? THAT'S WHAT MADE THE GAME SO ENDEARING!Well, now more annoying enemies, from (slightly swastika-shaped) knife throwing baddies, do little foot high charging idiots that mess you up (naturally). And plus, now missiles don't explode anyway when you give them enough time, so at one point I was trailing about 20 of them around the map. So good luck getting a prefect death count on a level.SO?Well, in conclusion, I liked the main game, but it had some problems that got dragged kicking and screaming into it's first DLC. Good music, boring repetitive gameplay, annoying instantkills, and some rather worn-out humor (unless Laser Nipples are your kinda thing!) round out this very meh game. Get with caution."

The music is brilliant as always - upbeat and giving you the drive to push forward even when you're about to alt+f4 the game out of sheer rage. The collectible stars add an extra challenge. Some dark stars are deviously placed, making some stages very hard to complete, but it's never impossible. The missiles are very annoying though. Glad you just can checkpoint-scum them away. (I'd like to think this was intentional, but who knows? Maybe an oversight from the developers.)Recommended if you loved the first game, but don't expect a full, new adventure as it's just a handful of new stages. It's really short, and just took me a little over 1 hour to complete."

I beat it in exactly 1 hour.Otherwise this DLC  is very hard and very fun with some awesome new music, but I cannot reccomend it at full price. Wait for a dicount before buying."
,Recommended,301460,12253568,"Posted: 26 September, 2014",all,moonbunnychan,"This game is honestly more like DLC then a stand alone game.  It's only got 12 levels and can be completed in about an hour.  The whole thing feels kind of rushed and the severe amp up in difficulty from the first game feels more there to pad the game's play time.However that said I had an absolute blast playing it.  It felt almost like reconnecting with an old friend.  I just wish the joy hadn't been ripped away so soon.  The 4.99 regular price isn't worth it, but if you can catch it in a sale it makes a great hour or so if you're a fan of the original game.There's also a level editor where you can create your own levels.  I imagine you could spend quite a lot of time on that, if that was your thing.  Wasn't of much interest to me personally."

And it is Electronic Super Joy: Groove City.10/10 would play again.Ok, onto my serious review.It's a very good, very hard, albeit very short video game. As an avid fan of the first Electronic Super Joy game, I was more than pleased with this  next installment. The soundtrack is amazing and the game is near impossible, but oh so fun. The help service is amazing as well, as I had a problem with buying the soundtrack. It didn't show up in my game file, and the developers immediately addressed the issue.Amazing game."

There are new, refreshing obstacles to overcome, new beings to kill you, and most important of all: new songs to set the groove. All of this mixed with an even wackier plot helps to keep the game from feeling like a rehash of the original.If you enjoyed Electronic Super Joy, you'll probably enjoy Groove City."

Soundtrack is just as good as the first one, and it's just as fun/frustrating as well. Dunno if it's still going on, but once I beat part of the first game, I got a coupon for this one for .99 so I would 100% recommend it at that price."

After playing it, I can honestly say the only thing this game has going for it is the music.The poor level design, frustrating jumps and the removal of the pound ability just adds unnessasary difficulty (at points) while absolutely killing any enjoyment that could've been had from this game.Don't pick up this piece of garbage even if it's on sale.2/10"

WHich I guess is a good thing, because the original game was also long and hard. See, it's even difficult to review it without innuendo!"

(Awesome)Pros :● Music - Temporately cures seizuresCons :● Too Short and pricy
