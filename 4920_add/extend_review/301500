This game is FUN.Although it might not be a 100% accurate sim experience it is a nice break from the stress of DCS World/IL2 mechanics,  and does not require an expensive Track IR and joystick setup (although joystick is recommended because mouse controls are a bit wonky right now).There are 3 views, pretty classic, 3rd person, cockpit (my personal favorite) and 1stperson no cockpit (why people fly like this i have no idea) Cockpit features lots of gauges and doohickys, all of which seem to function. Cockpits are also unique for each flyable plane, which seems obvious but is lacking in some other flight games.It features believable planes that are a cool mix of prop and jet/rocket fighters. You can usually guess which realworld aircraft inspired them by how they handle. Weapons usually consist of your stock machine guns and your choice of cannons/flak guns and other options.The game features multiplayer but i have not yet tried it, I think ill stick with the story for now.One last note, the support is awesome. Email with an issue and you can expect a quick reply and fix within days. They're helpful and courteous, and even though my specific issue has yet to be solved they told be to expect a fix in the next patch. Worth a buy for this alone.My only negatives are that mouse control and optimization could use some work (both are being worked on by the development team)And that I would like to see more planes added (but to be honest, my ideal flight game features hundreds of unique planes, so take that with a grain of salt)Happy Flying!"

They could have made them in to a single mission and it would have benefited the game.- The flight model is arcade, but not the fun type of arcade like Ace Combat. The gravity doesn't seem to affect your plane, it flies the same no matter which direction you chose, be that up or down and the rudders rubberband like crazy. It will swing you back to the direction you came from the moment you release the turn button. I would also like to point out that it feels like you are flying though molasses instead of air.- The environments look extremely bland and the trees flicker like crazy when you fly over them, the planes look nice, but everything else looks like an late Xbox / early360 game.- The performance is spotty at best, I was getting frame drops from 80 to 20 while nothing was happening on the screen and it doesn't look like a game that should ever drop below 60 on a 290X even on the highest settings.- The menus look like they are placeholder, especially the options screen and the mission failure one.- And the main con of all that just made me quit for good? It just wasn't fun. I love flight game like the Crimson Sky, Ace Combat, Blazing Angels, Sky Crawlers, etc, and this is a disgrace compared to all of them.I do not recommend this game unless you find it on sale."

Any comparisons made to Crimson Skies are pretty accurate.  I'd say the flight model is similar to War Thunder on ""arcade"" but the planes are considerably less maneuverable.  Considering you're flying a twin engine cargo plane, that's expected.The dialogue that strings the missions together is funny, brief, and to the point.  ""Go blow up the thing.""  There are bombs, rockets, torpedoes, and a variety of cannons that get strapped on the planes.  Thankfully the missions do have checkpoints, and restarting a mission after failing is ZERO load time.   I'm playing with a Logitech 3D Pro stick and it works perfectly after button mapping.  The game is set up for a 360 gamepad by default.  It also supports mouse control BUT that isn't quite working just yet.   Views are cockpit, 3rd person, and no-cockpit gunsight views.  Hold a key/button to momentarily padlock the current enemy, so you don't get lost in all the chaos.There's multiplayer, and even a dedicated server you can download.  I played some skirmish with the AI, and had them turned up a difficulty notch plus had too many of them fighting me, and I can attest the my end was brutal and swift.  :-)  The only thing I really feel absent is a nice hammy voiceover of the character dialogue.  The voice work in Crimson Skies was superb and really brought the game to life.  Reading the text balloons just isn't the same.  A pretty small complaint considering how much goodness is going on here for $12.DO IT."

It's very reminiscent of Crimson Skies in its inspiration (my first thought was Crimson Skies meets Porco Rosso) and the flight model feels similar to CS in that it's jump in and fly rather than a sit your PPL first simulation.As has been noted.. the dialogue (English version) could do with some loving, but other than that, it's rather fun.

Why?Because it isn't simply enough to take an arcade aircombat shooter and combine it with a more or less interesting story. Yes, Crimson Skies backstory is pretty interesting, as are the characters and the dialogues are witty. But this is just the glue that holds it all together.The secret of Crimson Skies success is, it gives you the illusion to be this daredevil fighter pilot who not only kicks his opponent's ♥♥♥ like an ace but who is also a skillful stunt pilot.The environments in Crimson Skies are interesting and challenging, while in the above mentioned games they are only beautiful window dressing. What a wasted opportunity!The only game I can think of that uses the environments the same way Crimson Skies did, is DogFighter. But this game is only a multiplayer platform. One moment you fly through the Great Canyon - the next through an Egyptian pyramid... Why? You are shooting at areoplanes! Why?Everything in this games feels complete arbitrary!Who knows? If the developers had invested in an interesting story driven campaign... this just might have been the next Crimson Skies!And finally - Crimson Skies only fault was... it came at least 10 years too early! What an amazing game it would be with today's graphics! I wonder why nobody thought about remastering it!? It would be the license to print money!Unfortunately Bomb is falling short towards those expectations: the dogfights are tedious and repetitive (one basically cycles endlessly until an enemy plane comes in view and then tries to shoot it down). Worst of all: the saving points are too far apart. One has to fight off wave after wave of opponents (like swarms of mosquitos) and when one fails at the end of the mission one is forced to replay the last 20 minutes of tedious gameplay! This kills the game for me!"

I forced myself to stop playing just to post this.If you liked Crimson Skies or Wings of War, this game is right up your alley. I'm a life-long flight sim player who enjoys both simulations and arcade flight games, and this game has the special sauce.- Fun, varied missions.- Pretty, retro graphics in a beautiful tropical environment- Accessible yet realistic-ish flight model (as far as arcade flying goes)- Fantastic controls, especially with an XBox 360 controller (haven't gotten it to work with my joystick yet)- Laugh-out-loud funny dialogue and story.- Great artwork and aircraft design"

The flying places itself nicely between arcady flyers such as Ace Combat and more advanced games such as the IL2 series. Although not required, a decent joystick setup makes this game a joy to fly, and it even supports TrackIR for those who are serious about their flight simulators (Oculus Rift support was added recently as well).The aerial combat is reasonably plausible, and a working knowledge of advanced combat maneuvers will come in handy as the AI seems to be subject to the same rules of physics as the player. The storyline gives a bit of background to the fuss and although not perfect, it does the job reasonably well.The missions are varied and there are actually some flying challenges in there (tricky landings) that is fun to pull off. The views are almost on par with what one would expect from a flightsim, and I primarly fly from the cockpit view with TrackIR. BOMB reminds a lot of the old Microsoft title Crimson Skies, and although this is a much smaller developer, the visuals are very pleasing and very functional.If you are not into flying games or flight simulators this game is probably not for you, but I can highly recommend this to any flightsimmer that enjoys ""seat-of-pants"" flying. I really hope the game does well and that the developer has a passion for this type of game. With the current graphics engine and development skills, if applied correctly, this is perhaps an outfit that can bring us the next iteration of Origin's Strike Commander (one can dream, right?). Good luck to La Moustace Studio!"

This is, without any doubt, the worst controlling game of any type or genre, that I've ever played since 1995.  Really really really reeeeaaaallly awful. With a 360 controller, the handling ranges from pretty bad to terrible. With a flight stick... well, it just doesn't map functionally onto a stick, so forget about it. With the keyboard it's....

It really is a successor to Crimson Skies.Has/had a lot of potential, but looking at how rarely it's updated, I don't have much faith the following issues will be resolved:- Some aircraft do not have cockpits-The ones that do, the sights seem to not line up with the guns.  Leading targets can be sporadic.  If it's not the sights, then it's the following:- The primary machine guns do very, very little damage.  You'll often waste 10+ minutes chasing a single fighter getting hit after hit, but they won't go down.- Text in many places is full of typos; poorly translated to english.- Some missions are very easy, then others ramp up in difficulty with no checkpoints or way to repair.- Overall lack of polish, between the GUI and lack of optimization"

Loadout, physics and handling are a lot like that game also.  I love DCS and il2:BOS and this is an 'acid' simplified version of that.  It's not an arcade flight model or damage model and so I can see why some people feel unempowered by it.  Personally I hate the sort of arcade 'sim'lites where the player destroys hundreds of arcade enemies.AI is very good, graphics are beautiful and the planes feel heavy and (to me) engaging, looking like WW2 pod racers/wachy racers.  A great game if you want a beautiful wacky/ porco rosso version of il2's skirmish mode.  I'll update with my thoughts on the campaign later.  Also runs well in DX9 on a GTX260 - which is impressive to me.Such a pity people have been so negative."

I love the fact that they dont baby you through shooting at enemies, like giving you a  little pointer telling you exactly where to shoot. I would also like to point out that some of the bad reviews have less than an hour of game time, which is when you have the first crappy plane in the story. You need to invest about 2 hours to get the next plane, less if you are especially skilled. The next plane is far better and way more fun to fly with, and is needed to keep up with the advancing diffuculty in the story, which has some fairly charming characters. The one thing that makes me laugh so hard but also bugs me slightly is when the AI tries to avoid you and miscalculates a maneuver and crashes into the ground. this happens more often than I would like to admit, but this only happens when there are large amounts of enemies. the AI could use a slight upgrade, but the game already is diffucult, so maybe not."

I chased him at max speed for roughly five minutes before I quit and made use of steam's new refund policy.Also, having the overdrive or afterburner (or whatever it is called) just being the last 5% or so of the thrust throttle is very poor design.  Adjusting the throttle on a Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick to the maximum speed without also hitting the afterburner is a headache of micro adjustments.
