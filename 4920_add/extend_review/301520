76561198046559193,Not Recommended,301520,30211326,Posted: 26 February,all,BananaTrain,"I decided to finally review the game which I knew and loved by the name of Robocraft.Which my review can be best summarized by:._.Robocraft started out as being such a interesting concept. Build a vehicle out of cubes and pit them in combat against each other in an arcade style arena. Robocraft was initially successful, but then the FreeJam lost sight of the original game. Making update after update that made the game worse.-Flying fast? Nah, speed is boring-Pilot seats & Triforcing? Nah, let's just build bricks-Teirs? Who needs teirs, let's just make matches unbalanced-More parts! Who cares about part balance, just create more!-More game modes! So many that you take forever to find a match-LOOT BOXES! everyone loves RNG and not get the items they want. They'll surely give us money nowPros:-Build bots out of blocks-Fight other players with your custom bot-Different weapons & movement partsCons:-Devs seem to make the game worse-Building lacks depth-Poor balancing-Very grindy (P2W)"
,Not Recommended,301520,30232963,Posted: 27 February,all,Robot,"Ruined by Developer Decisions and CarelessnessThis was one of my favorite games back in 2014. It had everything you could ask for: balancing, a good community, active and attentive devs, weapons that complemented each other, fun gameplay, good progression, lack of ""pay2win"" and so forth. Needless to say, it was awesome.Then the January 2015 update was released.The January 2015 update added a new gamemode where you destroy towers, levelled up, and respawn if destroyed. Initially, me and the rest of the community thought ""Cool."" and waited to see what else was in store. Little did I know that the downfall of Robocraft had begun.(Order not completely accurate)""Megabots"" (gigantic robots basically) were removed as soon as the update came out, if not before.Crates were introduced (partially replacing the robits system), level based CPU limits eliminated, and the tech tree removed, eliminating progression, reducing creativity, and generally made the game much worse. Despite the huge outcry and the veterans and other players who started to leave the game, the devs simply ignored the community and moved on.Helicopter blades were added, enabling people to make flying fortresses (maybe literrally). Personally I don't think much of this.Then weapons, most notably an anti-air cannon and a minigun, were added, making weapons unbalanced and the game more frustrating to play. As a pilot in Robocraft (a more ""traditional"" one who used plasma bombers), this particulary saddened and angered me.A robot shop was added, further reducing creativity.An intro was added into the game, giving the game a more ""cheezy"" feel and making it seem as if the developers were copying other games. By this point, I personally felt that the developers were catering more toward children (12 year olds) and no longer valued older players and veterans.All this time, veterans and other older players were leaving the game as it became increasingly apparent that the developers were not listening to the community.A new chat system was added, featuring a clan system that the community had been asking for for a long time. This was not nearly enough however, as the other changes above (as well as others) and the careless developers made the game unenjoyable for me (and potentially other older players, although I can not speak for them on this matter).I finally left Robocraft for good in mid 2015 (shortly after the new chat system was introduced) after a brief stint operating a hovercraft with SMGs.In it's current state, Robocraft is unbalanced and unenjoyable. The developers are careless and possibly largely inactive (aside from bugfixes and tweaks). Gameplay is frustrating, gamemodes horrible.As another reviewer (spynathan) has said: ""From Robocraft to Robocrap.""If, somehow, all (and I mean all) changes to the game were reverted back to sometime before the January 2015 update, say, November 2014, me and other members of the community (read their reviews to see what they have to say) who have left Robocraft may very well return.Until then, goodbye Robocraft.P.S. If you're going through old threads on the forums and spot someone with ""Dera32"" as their username, know that that's me. Please don't question my username choice; I know it's a horrible username."

I immediately got addicted to it and spent my spare time climbing up the teirs. The game reached its height when megabots where introduced. But over time the game got worse and worse. By the time crates where introduced the game was unplayable. I can't believe that you could mess up a great game this much.I do not recommend this game. It was a good game two years ago but now it is just terrible.

But I have played what it was back in its ""hayday"" and I have played what it is now. There was a point in my time of playing robocraft in which I couldn't stop playing. It was a drug, and an outlet to let my creatvity go head-to-head against other people's equally absurd ideas. What it is now, I can't really understand what went wrong. Call me melodramatic, but how does one screw up a wonderful game soBADLY? I don't know.All in all, this game has become what it worked so hard to go against. A game that requires very little creativity and a lot of mommy's money.Don't let me change your view of this game, give it a try. But know that you are playing a shell of a once mighty game."

There is no point to playing this game because FreeJam gives you everything off the start. There's nothing to work towards. Maybe FreeJam will revert back. But I doubt it.This game had so much potential to be (and was) amazing, but FreeJam wants your money, not your passion for a game that once was amazing."
,Not Recommended,301520,29437120,Posted: 22 January,all,Digitalbuzz,"sigh.....Really isn't much you can really do to get through to the devs. In fact they don't listen at all. I loved this game so much and put many hours into it. I did manage to play it for another ~20 hours after the ""Epic Loot"" update somehow but it got repetitive. That update in my opinion being the WORST adition you can possibly put into a game where you BUILD the robot the wa YOU want it. That update has made it literally the hardest thing to do due to it's mechanic. It could've been handled better like just a new reward you get along with earned currency. I got bored with this game real quickly because I couldn't really experiment that often or freely with new weapons and modules because I couldn't buy them.overall was good pre box era. Now really difficulit to get a foothold."

Good times.This game used to be friggin' AMAZING. Over time, every update just made it worse and worse.Pros:-Build a custom tank to use in battle-Party up with friends (if you had any ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°))-Multiple gamemodes including elimination and Battle Arena (kinda like control point in TF2)-Updates often bring new weapons and contruction itemsCons:-Updates tend to make the game worse-Tech tree was removed (level 1's can get lucky and have missile launcher)-Armorgeddon events (Increases everyone's HP to ruidiculous levels making every fight long and annoying)-HackersSomehow there's a hack that still hasn't been dealt with that makes the hacker's tank invisible and invincible ruining the entire game. It is impossible to fight against.-Instead of saving money to buy weapons and such, it has been replaced with crates/loot boxes that are completely RNG based other than the tier you recieve. You can still buy items, but they're ridiculously overpriced and you can only get money from selling items from crates where you tipically get items that sell from 1-100 dollars or robits when the only good things you can buy with them cost 5,000-1,000,000.

I give up.... rail guns are being used as tank weapons when they should be terrible at close combat.... and the new tesla bot that game out has free rain over the map and there is almost one in every game....  I recomend not playing this game until these have been fixed.  ranged weapons are fine if thats what they are good at not a all around weapons..... and teslas need to have a change where they have to deactivate there wepon or there cloak is droped.  If they make these changes then I will come back...  Try again in another year guys.  1/24/179/3/17 Note Update tried playing robocraft for a week.... I dont see tesla's all over the place any more so that must have been resolved... but rail guns are still a problem.... rail guns should be to shoot from a sniper position not close cobat... A FIX FOR THIS would be to make the rail guns beam tighter... expample I know most of you have been hit by a rail gun when the rail gun targeting beam is not even on your robot, this is becouse the beam has a certian thickness... make the diameter for the beam tighter.... this would turn rail guns back into what they are ment to be.  Until then still not a good game to get tell this is fixed.... Ill update again after another 6 months to a year... see you guys then...."

While it wasn't perfectly balanced (quite the contrary, really) you could still work your way up slowly but surely, given that you have enough time and patience.

76561198143954879,Not Recommended,301520,29616804,Posted: 31 January,all,Cpt. Hazzard,"I used to love this game. I started playing it when it was pretty new (around early 2014) and it was amazing then. I stopped playing after a while, and didnt play it for quite some time. Then one day I was looking through my library, and i saw this game, and I though ""Hmm that was pretty fun, I had a good tank, maybe Ill login and see whats new..."". That turned out to be a mistake.Aside from the building of the robots themselves, the game shows almost no similaritys to the fun and creative idea that it was in the beginning, and the only bots you see now are tiny, op balls of smgs that can somehow defeat a plasma tank that is 5 times its size. In addition, the loot crate system is just a front for the devs to make a cash grab with premium. Even if you somehow manage, as a new player, to do good in a match, and get a decent loot crate, you only get HALF of the loot from that crate unless you pay for premium access. Yes, ""see that legendary/epic weapon/part in your loot crate? HOORAY for you! But guess what, you dont get to have it unless you pay us money!"". And on top of this the recycling system, putting in parts to get ""robits"" to forge new parts, has an appalingly low return rate, which can only be increased by getting premium. And even then the return rate is low.The devs alos saw fit to get rid of the capture the flag game mode, and replace it with a glorified version of deathmatch called Brawl. It is essentially everybody against everybody deathmatch instead of team deathmatch. Apparently they thought we needed two deathmatch gamemodes instead of just one. It has no teamwork or strategy like the capture the flag mode used to have, its just kill everyone else and get money. If i wanted that kind iof mindless crap I would go play Gta V.To say the least I am VERY disappointed in the direction this game has taken, and the utter lack of attention the devs give to the opinions of their community.  Like a disproportionate number of other games in its genere, it has become all about the devs making money. And yes, i understand perfectly well that they need money to make and upkeep the game, but making it an unbearable grind and ignoring all advice from their players is unacceptable. 2/10, Ill be back when they start listening to us."

Let's start from the beginning:Imagine little baby me when I was 10, finding a game where you could build robots and pit them against eachother in a arena. My 10 year old mind couldn't handle it! I was freaking out! It was the best thing I had ever found. I played this game for a couple of years, day and night, thinking about what crazy design I could make when I got home from school. i then went on a holiday with my family. I came back, and tiers had been removed. That feeling of anticipation when you neared the next tier, was gone. I was pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ So, I took a break from the game for a couple of months, and when I came back? Armour cubes were gone. No compensation for the hours and hours that I spent farming those ♥♥♥♥ers, no warning. I soldiered on though, and kept playing.

I loved it because it was a grinding game, something that took skill either to construct or fight enemies. I really had much fun. But then, the worst update of all times came.

Before the crate update Robocraft was a game I told all my friends to play. Unfortunately, the devs ruined this. Constanly ignoring their community, the devs release updates that dramatically change the game. Usually their changes are not for the betterment of the game, but instead, to deepen their wallets. Over the 2 years I have played this game, I've seen everything that used to make this game great, get ruined by the devs implementing pay to win systems, loot boxes, and getting rid of some of the most satisfying aspects of the game.I recommend Galactic Junk League as a, free, fun to play alternative.Robocraft is now Robosh*t"

Updates don't work and often render the game unplayable. Hackers and bots ruin multiplayer gameplay. Constant changing of game modes, physics, and stats of items make it impossible to keep a consistantly good record. Had 4 bots and logged in one day to find them all deleted. Riddled with microtransactions. Overall just cannot recommend. Good concept but executed very poorly. Held out hope for a while that it would get better but gave up. They often give out free ""premium"" time for the absolute ridiculousness that ensues but just not worth it."

I have played this game for so long and I'm dissapointed about how much of a mess Robocraft has become. I'm sorry to say but, I don't like it anymore.There are constant updates so that robot you just finished making, the next day, a update comes out and guess what, That robot you spent five hours working on renders useless. I created my bot many years ago and yet, I didn't even think about what I was building. It was a burger colored caterpillar, I slapped some guns on it, gave it some wings and BAM, called it a robot.But there is something a bit worse now: balance. The game ""supposedly"" says: ""Please wait while we match you fairly with other players"". That is a straight up LIE. You could create some high tech 5 areoflak cannon bomber and be matched with new players. It's super unfair and it drives away players. FreeJam, get yourself together and bring back Tiers!Ever since FreeJam introduced the Community Factory, It has been a complete flop for me. It meant the richer players could make their robots have a 5 star combat rating and make them even richer, while those with limited funds, are stuck with the lower star robots, making little to no Robits off their robots. Guess what the first thing you look for when you go to the Community Factory, a good robot. So Robocraft shows almost only 5 star combat rated robots. And only the rich can buy them, leave the less rich to have to dig deep to just find a cheap, decent, robot.All these robots are being sold for over 120k robits! How are you supposed to make that much? It seems the only way is to either churn out money for that robot, or simply play match, after match, after match. Clan seasons are my main revenue of robits now. Your only choice to get that much is to either play for crates and hope you get good stuff to sell in the recycle, or you have to cough up them dolla dolla bills to buy a ship full of platinum crates and sell EVERYTHING you get from those crates.I can't reccommend this game until it's more balanced and gives robits whether or not you win or lose a match. Seriously. Hey, new players, keep in mind, RAIL AND PLASMA FOR DA WIN."

Also, the highest end stuff is painstakingly hard to purchase or acquire without premium or a soul pact with lady luck.For a game about creativity, you do see the same kinds of bots over and over and over (plus a few more overs).There are:The 'great' tesla rushersThe astoundingly stupid missile launchersA gun on the floorFlying sniper dronesBlinking RailgunsThe game balance isn't the best to say the least.

The interesting building mechanics, the satisfying weapons and the pure creativity you could employ in your designs made it one of my favorite games of all time. I would spend hours perfecting my more competetive designs or just building cool looking pirate ships for fun. After a while the developers started making some questionable choices in game design and my enthusiasm for the game cooled off a bit. Eventually I stopped playing it completely and forgot about it.I came back to the game a while ago and played a few games for old times sake and I really wish I didn't. I actually cried when I saw the current state of the game. This really was a great game at one point so it's incredibly sad to see how the development has gone. I knew from the very beginning that this game had huge potential so to see it get completely driven into the ground feels pretty bad. Atleast I will always have the good memories."

This game has a good concept, great idea, Robocraft is original indeed but...It's not the same thing like somewhen. Before you had: tiers, less equipment, WOT-like gamemode but teams were fair. Not like now. You're thrown at players (that have spent a lot of time, or money, or both) who have everything. Now you have to get better equipment right? to do so, you have to defeat enemies right? But how are you supposed to do that when each your enemy is like you x3??? back when there were tiers you used to play gainst players on your same or one less or one highier tier, and that was balance which somewhere, one the way to now was killed and I hope, in future restored.

That was the nail in the coffin. The gameplay is fairly boring too without megabots. SMGs feel like throwing toilet paper at people and the higher teir players are still significantly more powerful than new players. I could care less about the new guns they have been adding, there are some huge fundamental issues with this game at the moment and i highly reccomend that you stay away from this one."
,Not Recommended,301520,30196216,Posted: 26 February,all,cheekybean,"I never do reviews and the sad thing is i love this game. I have accepted game needs to develop even though I hated many of the changes, I stuck with it but lately I starting to lose hope. If your a solo player or in clan of casual players,  the new mmr system punishes you so much. I went form 1012 to 460 in 3-4 games. I lose -100+ for lost games even when top score on team and  sometimes only 50 or lower for a win. So unless your in a clan, good luck getting high mmr (if you say well don't care about your mmr, if it doesn't matter then why add it to game) Loading now takes forever it says 20-30 second and u can still be sitting there 5 minutes later. Balancing LOL 5 man clan vs 2x 2 man clan isn't balance. The new loading screen lies to you, it shows you as loaded but on friend screen your not loaded and he is loaded  on his screen  but on yous he is the one not loaded. People now leave games when they see what their up against in the waiting screen, so you have to wait all over again. As a result of the changes the community is becoming more toxic in chat. If you get disconnected from server for no reason or game freezes etc  you get a leaving game warning. Trying to contact them is a joke. I hope leaving beta it gets better but I'm on the verge of giving up on the game. Oh I almost forgot, they try to get you to pay full game price £39.99 for lifetime premium even after you already paid  that much and more on their monthly premium so they want you to pay £100+ for the game. Without premium the grind for robits is long. They hardly ever release codes for premium anymore so game seems to be more money grabbing than player fun now.If your still here thanks for reading it, I'm sorry its so long.

Everyone in the match is able to talk via chat box but is unable to move their bot. Another complain I have is the Factory. Being able to purchase people's creations is nice but at the same time it takes away from the game. The most over used bots are the teslas and drones. One person makes the perfect mech and everyone buys it. What I suggest is instead of letting people sell their creations, the game devs should sell bot frames of their own in the factory. Basically just the core of the bot and nothing else. The person buying the frame could then design and modify it the way they want. All in all, I give this game a 5/10.

Several types of matches are available as well. You are able to test bots you build/buy in an empty personal map with target boards as well as against AI bots. The usual PvP base capture, TDM, and kill limit match modes are available as well.Robot parts are awarded via a ""open the chest"" system at the end of a match, which provides parts of different rarity depending on the quality of the box received (which is based on your score). More chests are available for purchase from the in game store with RL cash. Unwanted parts can be recycled to gain a small fraction of their creation cost, which can be collected to forge the exact parts you want.Update 26/4/17 -Played 6 matches and got suddenly disconnected at about the mid point of each match. Received nothing for all 6 matches due to the DCs. Forget about building ""Alpha strike"" or ""Assasin"" type bots. Still using the new damage model, so the game is mostly about slugging it out face to face.

,Not Recommended,301520,29725573,Posted: 5 February,all,twisted habits,"i just returned to this game yesterday, i remembered it before my older computer crapped out due to hardware issues early this year. and i have to say compaired then to now, the game feels like it's a complete mess. let's begin with the controls to follow the curser to cause turning is probably the best controls you are going to get, i tried turning my vehicle with wasd and it felt very unresponsive and downright clunky. next lets talk about the gameplay itself, who the hell thought it was a good idea to make death match a jumbled mess? death match and brawl are the first two game modes you might play when you start this game, and both are ♥♥♥♥ing horrible. a lvl 1 can be placed with someone levels above him with better vehicles and better weapons. and the main currency in the game that you need to purchase weapons and blocks to make a better vehicle is locked behind recyling blocks in order to make any profit. but the prices are all over the map, for example a common blaster might cost less then a common radar why? who the ♥♥♥♥ cares not to mention the crazy prices people expect you to pay with this hard to obtain currency in the factory. the factory ok let me put it to you like this, a vehicle with maybe 1k cpu or less can sometimes be sold for 20,000 in game currency may i remind you this currency can only be obtained by either A.) recyling parts that you get from chests or b.) selling your current abomination in the factory and hoping that someone or multiple parties will purchase it but even then you are only getting a little bit of currency per purchase. lastly lets talk about the reward system aka the chest system. no matter how good you do in a losing battle i have found you will either get bronze or rust level chests containing items that either a are just blocks or b sell for very little cash making it next to impossible to purchase better items or a better vehicle model from the factory. it may just be because i just rejoined this game yesterday but it doesn't feel balenced, how can it when you have a enemy in the sky that has a multi lock weapon that chips off 15- 20 health a hit. it's not fun and it's a horrible mess. i hope the devs fix this instead of worrying about stuff like premium another feature that limits the fun you can have in this game. you need it to unlock paints custom avi's and to get bonus items that are LOCKED from a players earned chest. premium in a game like this feels like a stupid idea, considering that most chests will give you 6 items and 3 of them are locked behind premium. here's hoping again that the devs will put some serious work into this game, i hate to see a game i enjoyed so much from 2 years ago fall so far since i have been away."

You got literally mechs of over 1500+ facing off against starter 500-900+ CPU bots. The game was honestly amazing when they actually had LEGIT fair MM.2. The anti-cheat mechanic is, atleast from how I have been seeing it, not working at all and infact even supporting hackers. Alot of people are breaking the spawnprotection of new robocrafters and even teleporting around (by this, im not including the blink module).3. The crates. Yes, the crates. These little buggers have become the death to many of people. Rusted crates, usually bad stuff, but super rare things? That makes no sense. If you got a rust crate, you would crappy stuff, its that simple. Plutonium crates (the best one) dont even give good things, and when they do, you have literally made such an overpowered bot that its useless. Reading one of the reviews from some other people, I have to agree, this game has became a pay to win. Paying to win games is what kills young audiences like myself who actually enjoy the game in order to be creative, to let our young minds be shown into these amazing and well put together bots. But no, CRATES had to come in and ruin everything, hell, it even ruined my childhood. For people who ""pay to win"" they also get ripped off because for example, if I was to buy say about 60 plutonium crates, I would be getting good and epic items from only like 20 of them. Yes, 20. Plutonium crates are suppose to be the best crates ever right? Well, where is the good loot? I dont need all these random blocks and uncommon and rare stuff, im expecting epic and legendary items. Its a waste of money.Thanks to these reasons, even though the devs may not care that its 1 person, I will be retiring from robocraft till things are fixed. If anyone cares to join me, I say lets boycott together, not only as individuals, but as a huge group of robocraft lovers and creative minders alike.Thank you for your time and understanding.-POLICEUNIT"

It seems that the developers tried to make this game a bit more ""accesible to new players,"" which essentially means that they killed everything truly unique about the feel of the combat, removed the necessity to have an actual role that your robot fills by allowing you to use more than one weapon type, and taking a chainsaw to the old part obtainment system and gutting it, turning it into a crate system reminiscent of FIFA and counterstrike in an obvious attempt to substantially increase cashflow.

They removed the system in which bots are ranked by complexity and strength, therefore allowing players to purchase the best items with real money and battle against brand new players. In order to reach the level with a ""fair"" match making system, you have to reach level 10. With how difficult it is to win when your oppenents have more health than your entire team combined, this can take thousands of matches. Overall 2/10. Creating robots and fighting AI is fun, but the meat of the game is impossible to enjoy without shelling out tons of money and building ugly designs.

The actal gameplay is fun, building is pretty simple and the economicsusedto be good.GameplayThe actual gameplay is relly good, its has a few diffrent types like your typical team deathmacth, theres also battle arena mode witch is where you capture towers to get advantages for you and your team with the end goal being to destroy the enemy fusion tower (or base), there are more, but i wont talk about them. overall, i would give the gameplay a solid 8/10.Building/Garageone of the main things about robocraft that makes it so original is that you can create your own robots! althought it may sound difficult, it really isn't. the way they made it makes it so simple to build your robot, aslong as you make facing the right way (it will go sideways or backwars if you dont) because you cant rotate it (really annoying!!!). Also one the cool things you can do is buy or sell robot desings. overall, on the robot building part, i give it a 6/10EconomicsNow here is where things go bad... for some reason (probably money realted) the devs thought it was a good idea to change the economics syteme from a normal money systeme that worked well, to a creat systeme where the only way to make in-game currency is to sell parts that you get from creats that are usually pretty bad, so you have grind for hours just to be able to afford any good peices... that is unlesse you buy the premium feture, witch will let you get better itms that can acually be useful, or sell for more. Over all, i give this part a 1.5/10...Summarythis game used to be amazing before the update that brought the creat systeme to the game, so if you dont mind grinding for countless hours just to get a good robot, this game is for you...

You start with no knowledge of mechanics, and no idea how to build a combat viable robot, the games toturial does and will not provide. I will now break this down into sections.I am a veteran.Ive played this game for many many hours for a long time. Ive seen its peaks and drops but with the propellor update, this game will DIE. The Devs have completly stopped listining to the players and instead get advice from the top clans (People who exploit this living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of exploits, DRONES the cancer of this game) and they are all manipulating the devs to turn the ties of updates in their favors, this happens because the dev team is just flat out stupid. (Before you say thats BS i know most of them, ive directly influenced their decisions for updates countless times if you couldent tell, they stopped communicating with me) for the past year their update initiatives where to remove drones from the game, every single damn update they had that was supposed to directly kill drones only made them stronger, and now with propellors they are the strongest they ever were (Drones are flying boxes that move so fast you cant possibly hit them, are often in platoons of 5 people each using one)Basic combat and mechanicsIn Robocraft the combat system is basic, there is an energy bar (mana) that drains whenever you use weaponry or modules, and constantly regenerates, the rate of consumption is painfully high no matter how you have your bot specd. after 10 seconds of taking no damage you rapidly regenerate any lost health (in robocraft damage dealt will destroy blocks on your bot, meaning if they shoot your weapons off you wont have them, they wont be there anymore) all the way back to 100%. You die when there is only 25% of your total bot left. (your hud displays your health without this, simple enough. this is only here for balance) You may only have 5 diffrent weapons on your robot at once, you may only select one at a time in combat. (NOTE THEIR ARE DIFFRENT LEVELS OF WEAPONRY FOR EACH WEAPON, A CERTAIN LEVEL COUNTS AS A WEAPON SLOT. IN REALITY THIS IS DEPRESSING)ModesRobocraft has an multiple gamemodes to play.Team DeathMatch (TDM) is a 5v5 where both teams must get points by destroying eachother, when you get to a certain threshold of kills (points) you win. The rewards here are ehhh bad? yep bad.AI TDM. A diddo to normal TDM, except this is agaisnt Robocrafts terrible AI, you cannot bring your freinds into this and the rewards either dont exist or are irrelivent.Battle Arena. This is apart of the devs intiative to make this a Moba. There are 2 bases one for each team, there are 3 towers that can be captured by players who shoot at them for 3 years. having towers gives your team benifits, at 1 your base now has a shield that your enemies cannot shoot through but you can, in the shield (its a large dome) you slowly regenerate health (despite auto healing) at 2 your OC gets ""boosted"" (OC or overclock is an in game level up that provides more damage, more speed, and Electroshields, a defensive part gain more health, the max OC level is 15, everyone starts at one and you gain more by damaging, healing, capturing towers, and killing the enemy) at 3 your enemys base's shield goes down, meaning you can now start the 100 year process of destroying it, when you do you win. (Theres also protontivity, meaning you do more damage to towers and the base the longer the game goes on and the more towers you have, ALSO capturing a tower revives everyone waiting for their long respawn instantly) The rewards here are the best of all modes and yet terribleLeague Battle Arena. Ditto to above, except winning or losing increases or decreases league ranking (league ranking is a non existent version of competitive ranking, there is Bronze Silver Gold Platinum and Protonuim, your rank does not ever deviate and once you get to the highest ranking you never have to play this again, the only thing league rank gets you is a badge cosmetic for your bot that you cant otherwise get, rank is not shown anywhere except this cosmetic, meaning rank means nothing at all ever.)Building. Here you build your robot out of blocks of which are divided into Blocks, Movement, Hardware, (guns) misc, (radar equipment and modules, RADAR EQUIPMENT DOES NOTHING AT ALL DO NOT USE IT) and cosmetics. this is easily the most enjoyable part of the game which in itself has become stale and no longer fun.Weekly Brawl, a weekly custom gamemode to whatever the hell the devs decide they want for that week, gamemode and rules always varry.Testing. Self explaining, take your bot on a test drive in a course with no other players/AIThe Community and BalanceOhh boy from what you should have read so far this game should be good enough for your download, now rread this. Most of the playerbase consist on young children, 5-13, these people searched for a free minecraft and found this instead, i dont need to explain why this is bad for the game. Then there are the sweaty exploiting tryhards of top clans Atlas Core, OverPowered, Invictus Rex, Mockingbirds, The Greys, a few more. every single person within these clans use some form of game mechanic exploit, most notably drones. (I mentioned this before) if you should fight a 5 man platoon of these people you should either surrender or just quit the game, you will not win, their exploits will not be patched.Balance. The devs are just plain stupid, they dont play their own game (generally) they dont ever listen to community outcry, they never ever even touch their own forums. Thus they cannot balance ANYTHING, things will always either be unusably terrible or unimaginably overpowered, you will get infuriated very quickly.DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. YOU WILL BE DISSAPOINTEDFor those of you who already play this game i thought itd be a good idea to let you all know what i built.

76561198086755541,Not Recommended,301520,30202386,Posted: 26 February,all,Fainaigue,"(For Steam this is from a reddit post I made)I made a post before trying to get all technical with numbers and whatever that looking back at, i didn't have enough experience with to try and come off sounding smart. So instead I will just put plain and simple, things IMO that just threw me off.I do want to say that starting the game, I loved it. I have an addictive personality when i find something I really enjoy. I played this game for just about 24 hours straight at one point. Was that a good decision? No. Did I have a blast doing it? Yes. It remained my go to game for about 2 weeks, then I finally couldn't take all of the things that were bothering me and finally stopped.So let's get started.Pros:- You can build your own craft.- A LOT of customization in doing so. Type of movement, Type of gun, Tank or Squishy, Healers, Flyers (My personal favorite.) and it goes on.- Competitive.- Skill based. As any shooter is really. Except in this you don't just aim for the head. You find the weak points and go from there.- Crates. Nobody can resist crates nowadays. It's like the new generation of gambling.- Forging/ Crafting.That to me is all just fluff though. Eye candy. This stuff alone could make any decent game. It's basically the set in stone formula for any modern game. I call them pros but I think what I mean is ""good on you for following the formula""Cons/ Things that irked me so bad it made me quit the game:- Bugs come first rather than game play and balance. I have not had one problem that was game-breaking. If the game runs fine leave it (focus more on another part) until it's not.- Unbalanced. Lock on Missiles, Tesla's, Shotguns, Chain Guns, Air Flaks, and Rail Cannons (Iffy). One could argue that map awareness, positioning, and skill in general could counter this but when you cant evade the rockets, have no time at all to react to a cloaked Tesla because you're instantly dead, and try and run from shotguns before you're blown to bits but they still do tons of damage at mid to long range, and air flaks are basically a one hitter for planes/ copters, their squishy and are easily enough immobilizable, what's the point other than realism, then none of that really matters.- Tiers of parts. With the exceptions if shields and movement parts. I wish multi tiered blocks were left in too. As much as having an upgraded version of anything in any aspect of life is, it is my feeling that they should stay out of arena based games ESPECIALLY shooters and skill shot based games. MMR would make more sense then.- Crafting and crates. Crafting should require materials that you either get from crates or get when you dismantle something. Crates should contain mostly blocks and before mentioned materials with a chance of an extra part or two.If tiers does remain a thing, match people up against bots of the same caliber, not skill. If skill is gonna be any factor it should focus more on how a bot is built. Kinda like the classes of weight in UFC, boxing, and wrestling. Could be based on CPU Load.- Lack of modes and maps. I'm sure there are more to come, but what happened to the old stuff? It worked, it was fun. I heard that BOSS Mode was taken out because people/ someone thought it was too OP..... For real? Wasn't that the bloody point!? What happened to the chasm in the desert map? I had plenty of exciting 1v1's in that pit. IDK, the maps just seem so.... bland now. And why not use the maps you have now for team death matches too rather than that itty bitty thing. Probably be better for that than the current tower possession mode. Speaking of which, bring back the classic capture point. I don't want to focus on a tower while I have unbalanced weapons to worry about.And what was wrong with the little astronaut dude you used to build your bot around? At least then I'd have an Idea of when I was about to die or how to kill others rather than just firing away like a maniac.The only weapon that had a skill was the Proto-Seeker against shields. why not give the other weapons bonuses against wheels, guns, legs, etc.- Rarity scaling? That's confusing. Higher tiered parts do seem to show up less often in crates, buuuuut with a little bit of grinding you can acquire those parts anyway which then turns from rarity scaling to what, power scaling? Price scaling? It seems here, someone they just wanted to hop on the crate craze but didn't really think it through.All in all, I think the game has been ruined. It was a good thing before and all that needed to happen was some tweaks. The game has changed entirely, almost as if it's a knock-off of it's former self.However, I will still check in the future to see if they leartned their lesson."

,Not Recommended,301520,29873735,Posted: 12 February,all,Dovahkiin,"I play Robocraft since it was good. See a game that had a bunch of potential turning in what it is today, is reallysad. I remember the time when you had to put the Motorist's Chair inside the robot, the time where you had Blocks with different defence or even better than some blocks, the time where each level you unlocked new guns and better itens. Now, it's not like that anymore. You don't need the chair, there is only 1 type of block, even if the person entered Robocraft now with Level 1, they go fight with persons while having a plenty of legendary itens in the robody, and so I ask you: Is it fair? The person didn't even logged in the game, don't know how to do a good robot, doesn't have good pieces (Since, even playing the match like a pro, there doesn't come any good item in the box) and have to fight with a person thousand times better than him, even being on Level 1??? I relaly miss the time where there was Titan Fights (Low Level players vs some three Hight Leveled Players), those battles, was the tension and adrenaline. You having to be cautious to not lose any pieces, because in this time you didn't regenerated alone after 10 seconds. THIS, was the Robocraft I used to know and the true Robocraft. You, developers of Robocraft, could make the game like it was before. You could leave it with those itens, but remove the crate from the game, add the Money after completing a match. Because the box, even if you play very well, the probability of gaining a good item in the box is close to 0, so, coming back with the oney would make this issue resolved. Also, there should be the Itens Tree back, the one where after leveling up, you unlocked new itens. This would solve the issue of you being Level 1 (and not even knowing how to play properly) and entering with a level 1 guy, but with millions of good itens (That even not knowing to play as well, will kill you very quickly (Like the ""Teslas Noobs"")) because wasted all your money buying boxes. Come back with blocks with different health and stuff, that you unlocked better blocks each level. I get really sad to see what Robocraft turned now...You guys could leave the movements we have now, the itens, but bringing back the money and the iten tree. It would make the game MUCH better. In the old times, where you had an objective: Level up to unlock new itens, and make a good robot. Now, we don't have one objective, because if you have money, in less than 1 day, you can become the god of the game. Please, bring back how the game was before, with the old gamemodes, you could keep the new game modes we have now, but with the old ones as well, please. Keep the Battle Arena, Death match, but please, bring back the Titan gamemode, where you had to conquer the base of another team. So, yeah, bring back iten tree, the money you had after the match, remove the boxes, bring some old gamemodes, and have the blocks with varied health and stuff, the regeneration, or only use it in Battle Arena, but remove it from other gamemodes, you can keep the clans, and also, BRING BACK THE TIERS! I am really sure that everyone will like or even LOVE Robocraft again, and everyone will play it like how it was played before. Think about all I said here. Thanks for taking you time for reading and understanding."

First off, the devs don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the playerbase. I'm apart of the playerbase of Robocraft Original, yes, original. I call it ""original"" because the devs changed up the game so much that it's basically a new game with building. When there was a tech tree, armored blocks, etc, the game was so balanced and it was not pay-to-level-up-faster (pretty long, oh well). But now with this Robocraft 3 (As far as my knowledge, devs basically rebuilt the system ground up 3 times) it has loot crates, no armored blocks, you can pay money to get things faster (loot crates or premium) and now these blocks with abilities, and it's totally unbalanced! I got a plane with 2 weapons and get placed into a match with people who had bots that were very small against people with bots that had 20 weapons on them. I'd be fine with the blocks with abilities and every block in the game but if it had the older and better (in my opinion) robocraft system with tech tree, armored blocks, etc. But in conclusion, the devs just don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the playerbase and don't know what to do with the game. ""I don't like this system, lets put this new one in, and for the playerbase that like the current system, ♥♥♥♥ them.""

Now?If you're a new player the game is totally P2W and it isn't much fun. Beceause, unless you buy a bot from the factory, you will do nothing bet get wrecked over and over and over and over and over and over and over because the most you can build is a 700 cpu bot. That shouldn't be a problem, you know, if you were playing against other bots like that. Instead you're matched, all the time, against 1,000 + cpu bots and noobs who buy bots from the factory so they can win.Again, the game is not that much fun. I've made it to Level 14, thanks to this weird crate reward system (which no one seems to like from what I've read from older players) I have nothing to build a bigger bot with (even if I sell everything I get peanuts in robits), these matches are really unbalanced (a team of 6 flyers and 1 mech vs a team of all ground units with lots of plasma and no flack to shoot flyers with) and this game crashes...a lot...and then punishes you for leaving a match early when it was their game that crashed (literally, the game just shut itself in the middle of a match and I have no desire to log in again because there's this dumb 5 minute lock out that happens if you leave early, even if you got booted out because the game has a problem).In short...this game is not fun and fun is the point of a game.But, hey, if you're a noob who is willing to pay to win this is a great game for you."

,Not Recommended,301520,29790601,Posted: 8 February,all,Wryn,"It was a very good, very fun game for a while; then the devs started messing with stuff and really seemed to stop caring about player feedback.They made a game mode (coincidentally, my favorite game mode at the time) only accessible for the highest-tier bots; there is nothing wrong with that, except that the game mode that most players were left with gave us WAY less in-game currency for winning.They removed what was a very fun tech tree, that allowed for a lot of customization, and replaced it with level advancement. Not totally a bad thing, but it stopped feeling like I was advancing; the tech tree gave me a million choices regarding what parts to unlock. The system they switched to was linear; you go up a level, you unlock a new part. It felt like going through the motions of advancement without any real sense of achievement.And by gods, the Pay To Win was overwhelming when I stopped playing; apparently the only balance Freejam understands is their bank account balance.And I get it; you can't make games for free.But Freejam decided that they care more about how to suck as much money out of as many people as possible, rather than what would make the game experience better for their playerbase.I'm not kidding, at one point when they were messing around with new game modes, they explicitly said that ""only NEW player feedback was being considered"", because they wanted to know ""whether it affected retention or not"".And it was such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You can't make an accurate comparison between gamemodes when all of your feedback from both modes are from people who only experienced one mode; that isn't how that works.And as a veteran player, it hurt immensely to hear that my opinions weren't even being read.It's such a shame; I loved playing this game early on. The concept is fun and exciting, and Freejam really could've made something great out of this.But instead, it seems all they care about is sucking as much money out of as many people as they can."

I played robocraft back when it just added hoverblades. basically early early alpha. i played all day everyday nonstop till it came on steam. had to do some IRL duties. Came back to it now. and well. I'll start by saying i really really miss the ""shop"" and tech tree. I feel like it gave you freedom to spend your earned tech points on what you been drooling over next. This salvage crate idea. Eh. Theres no set economy. You can't have really good skills and a bot to match perfectly with those skills. and Grind to a end unlock and excitment. Now its, lets say two people. both equal. Well instead of getting more points as a motivation to keep going. One person can play one game. and unlock a ledgendary. Plenty of rares. While the other guy, is opening his crate. and gets only uncommon. you cant hold a ledgendary to a value like you used too. before you saw the price tag and you said wow. not for the little people apperently. now one person worked hard to get a ledgendary that he actually can use. the other unlocked one in the beginning and sold it with no second thoughts. The crates dont work very well. IMHO. also the combat. I liked the all in one smg. etc. not the weapon energy, or the each tier of a single type of weapon being unable to fire at the same time.."

After seeing not a single positive review in terms of the way that the devs are handling things and the direction the game is going ""pay to win""  The one reason i quit robocraft in the first place was the issue of joining tier 2-3 matches with people who have tier 10 robos, but have decided to make a small robo with a big high tier weapon on it, so ""by statistics"" it's tier 3.  Instead of trying to eliminate this and continue to balance the game, aparantly they've gone the oposite and it takes a long time to get out of low tiers because you never win a match.

You can make almost anything in this game! I love that about Robocraft. However, im not here to praise this game, as im not recomending this. I have a huge reason I dislike this game. 1. Balancing. When I first started out, I could only use land-bound machines. This wasn't a problem, until i encountered multiple people with WAY better weapons than me. Fine, I let that slide. I blamed that on the fact I was playing with some higher level friends of mine. Lets fast forward a little bit here. I was starting a Battle Arena ON MY OWN this time, and I still had the land bound machine. Once I get into the game. I start rolling around to get the one of the objectives. Nope. I can't even do that. I STILL encounter these people that have WAY better guns than me. I even went to go build my own machine with halfway decent weapons. I still couldn't do hardly anything, and that was the last straw. I love this game, but I cannot recomend it. If you are willing to get your butt handed to you because of balancing, go right ahead, all power to ya. Im going to stick with my decision and I hope this review helped."

But after the recent updates to this game, things have REALLY taken a turn to the worst.There are huge issues with this game, all which could easily be fixed:GAMEPLAY:- Close to no balancing system what so ever; especially in terms of the air vs ground vehicles- Player balancing is awful: after an update, I (lv 80) was playing against lv 15 players, who had much less good gear than me...- Regeneration: to save your skin, just hide for 15 secs. It really ruined the amount of risk charging into enemy lines...- Really slow queue time (25 minutes in my case, heard of 40h for others...)- Very simple and plain maps, which are outdated compared to the new vehicles (where there once were only a small handful of flying ships that could easily navigate the map quickly now cover the maps)-  Very repetitive gameplay: same games on slightly different mapsVEHICLE CREATION:- While there was an expansion on the number of weapons, all types of blocks have been deleted, expect the most basic block in favor of being able to colour the ship. Where once the colour of the blocks represented the toughness of the ship is now purely used as a decorative functionality, which I find is a huge drawback.- Progress is excruciatingly slow now in getting new gear. In my case, the better weapons cost 100s of times more than the amount of cash won per game, making this truly a Pay To Win Game...- Bought vehicles dominate the game, making the diversity of vehicles, well, not diverse at all.Overall, what was once a really good and enjoyable game in terms of gameplay and preogression now lost both attributes.If you really want to have a go, go ahread, it's free.

They are criminals.http://www.ripoffreport.com/reports/freejam/portsmouth-po2-7jz/ratings-and-reviews-robocraft-freejam-stole-money-from-me-1290478There are currently over 10,000+ negative reviews listed onSteamPowered.comfor this company's product called Robocraft? As for me, this company stole money from me and I reported them to the UK police and Cyber Crime unit for monetary theft. As an award-winning game modder for many other games, I gave some really good constructive criticism on this company's forum that would make their product, Robocraft mindblowing, but the game devs didn't approve. So much so that they banned me from the forum. They claim they banned me for insulting other forum members but only after I was first attacked ten fold. After I was banned from the forum I created another forum profile and they apparently posted a forum reply warning me that they would ban me access to the software product if I kept posting on their forum. I never saw that warning. I've never heard of a company communicating to a customer in such a way. Why wouldn't they simply send me an email, as they have my email address on file. Anyhow, I logged in to play the game and my premium account that I had just paid for 3 days prior was permanently banned, and so I lost my money and they refuse to refund or re-activate my account. This is the only company I've ever seen ban access to their software product because of online forum activity that is completely separate from one another. It is very odd and is why I'm filing this report onRipOffReport.com."

As a big fan of game's that use your imagination, robocraft is about all I could ask for.  Strategic building, an Element of teamwork, and overal fun. One of my favorite Features is the fact that you have to balance how big your bot is with how long it can shoot. You need energy to shoot and the bigger the bot is, the more movement parts and guns on it, and the number of cosmetic items on it the less energy it has. So you have to balance size and power.here's how it works;1. You build a robot, using various guns, and a variety of movement parts (tanktracks, mech legs, propellers, etc)2. Test your robot, see if it moves, if it has a decent fire rate, moves well. f and overall works.3. Hop into a game. (there are 2 gamemodes, basic, 5v5 tdm, and normal, a more stratigic game, with less senseless shooting)Pro's;Easy to playBeginner friendly, the game offers 3 starting bots, some of which I see in competative playFun by yourself, and with friendCreative ideaCon's;The meta in this game needs to be revamped (Edit: the meta has been slightly toned down, but is still too good)Disapointing MRA system (Edit: the MRA system has been fixed to work better)Mediocre crate systemPay to Progress quicker.But dispite its cons Its a wonderful indie game, that I recomend."

All of these negative reviews seem to be missing three key factors:1. You can go to the forums and whine about it there, you don't need to clog up the area where people are acutally looking for valueable information.2. This is a free game, other than the customary spawn of satin(the dark lord of comfortable bedsheets), microtransactions, there is no cost to this game. If you have a few spare megabytes and 30 minutes of your time, you can play this game. 90% of you guys never spent money on this, Freejam owes you very little, stop yelling at them like you're out for revenge.3. THIS IS AN EARLY ACCESS GAME YOU PEANUT-MUNCHING DEGENERATES. The overall system in this game is always subject to change if people don't like it. No bug in this game will last forever as long as you report it. No cool idea will be ignored as long as you suggest it.So wait until the game is finished, and actually released. If you have a problem with the game, don't just spam every update post with ""R.I.P. Robocraft"" and ""Fix My Unspecified Problem"" comments. Freejam have given us methods of suggesting things, like the Q.O.L. polls, brawl suggestions, and the good 'ol bug report. Mindless spam of negative comments will not work.

,Recommended,301520,30080742,Posted: 21 February,all,kinghomer,"My 2000 hours of Early Access / Alpha with RobocraftFor the tl;wr crowd: Yes, try the game to see if it suits you. It's free to play, not really big either and it's elaborate enough to test.Do not: expect to get 2000 hours out of it or buy into it right away without testing.The ConceptStripped of all but the bare concept, RC comes down to building your own vehicle and driving it into team battles. That and its modular damage system are the strongest selling points for me. In other words, how you place your blocks and mount your weapons influences how well your creation does, just as well as skill. That's the basics, now onto my dislikes, likes and hopes for its further development.The DislikesI really wish I could write this any different, but the development has been a bumpy ride. When I started playing about 2 1/2 years ago, the game had 10 (later 11) tiers, there were 3 free garage slots, damage in battle was permanent and had to be repaired with the money earned when returning to the garage. Robots were built around a pilot seat, progression was vertical and included a tech tree. There also was only one real game mode where every of the 10+ players on each side had only one life. None of that exists anymore.The concept, of course, is still there. The problem is that on the way to the current situation, many of the above features left some sort of legacy behind that then hampered further development. The biggest and still unsolved roadblock for me is tiered and mega items.A short explanation onMegabots: Originally these were planned as endgame items and vehicles with increased size, but also some restrictions. Eventually they became money farms, killed the gameplay of Elimination (a now dead game mode) while they were not integrateable into BA (the second game mode that was released shortly after megabots) and were patched out.The mega parts are still around. They don't fit in the size scale, even though by now there are more of the oversized weapons. They also affect balancing of energy consumption and damage. Worse than the mega items, though, are the tiered items still being around. New items usually come in two sizes. The old ones have up to 6 iterations. Lasers for example that are hardly different other than in rarity. Or wheels that are all similar in size, just not the mega remnants that suddenly explode in diameter.Another point to be made about the development is that something always fell off the far end. There are many examples, but to name a few: when BA was originally introduced, the capture towers (likely to be patched out in the near future) came with additional features called fusion barriers. It made sense at the time when gameplay was slower and more tactical. The pilots were supposed to come with special abilities, the so called SCU. So not only things were dropped that existed, but also planned ones that were part of how things should work. Don't get me wrong here, I don't blame the devs for trying out stuff. They can and should do that. Just not in a constant limbo between a vague concept and their alpha-testers.This leads me to another point I really dislike: the interaction between the dev team and the community. Some things are alright, the devs do regular streams etc. But some important things are just abhorrent. There is no real system of bug reporting. If you find something and transmit it through their system you get a notification in the likes of ""thanks for reporting, we know about this bug"". And it's still not fixed to this date. Sadly a patented solution would probably be them not using the above phrase anymore, instead of introducing a proper reporting system with some sort of accountability. Mojang have shown how easy that is, including a protection against game breaking exploits not being passed on.Another such point is that the official forums are still running on wordpress. In and by itself not a bad thing. Just not up-to-date with the possibilities of a modern forum software.Things about the current gameplay I really don't like: a few months ago the relation between CPU usage (number of blocks/items used) and energy was inverted. Small builds now have more energy, while big bots have little. This effectively makes many bots glass cannons and since it's still mostly balanced around the previous limit of 1750 CPU, the time to kill is really low. High CPU having low energy makes them about as useful as a nipple on armour and together with the death of the elimination game mode and the concept of a HUB game mode, sadly limits art bots to the contests run by the community manager. ""It's something"" at least, I guess. Prepare to get yelled at or lose Elo points if you take artbots into battle though.Lastly, there are some dubious decisions about ""automated systems"" in gameplay. Be that auto heal after 10 seconds of no damage, camera controlled steering or auto aim / aim assit. The problem with these is not their existance. It is their unequal distribution over different parts that favors certain robots and play styles that are hard to counter, if at all. Something that has been known for a long time and the devs did not act on either way.The LikesOh boy, there is some good stuff in this game. I already mentioned that when talking about the concept, but building and improving your own vehicle over time is such a great idea that many of the shortcommings can be ignored while it is still in development. You want to drive a tank or pilot a  spaceshuttle, run around as a superhero or fly a war plane? That's all possible and increases with every new part.The weapons, movement parts and modules are really well done. The art team is outdoing itself with those on a regular basis. Just like the visual and sound effects guys. They are constantly improving their work, contributing a lot to the overall flair of the game.The music is awesome, don't turn it off before you heard it on every map, they all have different soundtracks. Sadly, some of the visuals get lost in lower graphic settings, but that's to be expected. This paragraph is way too short to do justice to all the excellent work put into the game. Go see for yourself.I also like that it is possible to play with up to four friends in a 5-man-party. If you decide to try the game, consider taking your friends, siblings, other relatives along. Sharing the experience increases the fun. For easier party building you can even found a clan, which also increases your earnings.Outside of the game, they also do some things right. Hyping up the players with their lore newspapers when new releases are around the corner comes easy for them. It connects everything really well. Often cryptic and to be taken with a grain of salt, these newspapers are only in a limited way an announcement of what is to come to the game. If you search for reliable information, wait for the patchnotes, that are also delivered before updates.Venturing further outside of the game, the devs also use some 3rd party sites to show their content, the music can be found on soundcloud, some of the models on sketchfab, wallpapers on wallhaven, you get the picture.The HopesFor the upcomming beta phase, I hope they complete all the half-baked content (e.g. tutorials) fix the worst bugs and work on optimization. It pains me to see a game once playable on a ""craptop"", as they called it, in this state. Of course I'd love to see new/custom modes, new building blocks and parts. Those can be added on the way, since they hardly cause problems.Thanks for reading, enjoy exploring the game and its further development."

HOWEVER, I still play. The fact that there are few viable bot types and the community is now competitive and unfriendly does not prevent me from playing. I would still recommend this game as a great building game and with fun multiplayer. Now, though, I would caution you thusly: the game is not finished. They will remove features you love. They will add things you hate. But it is still a great game, and I will still play it for a long time further."

,Recommended,301520,29474251,Posted: 24 January,all,arcman46,"I am going to say this right from the start: Robocraft is an awesome game. It's fun, action packed, creatively driven and has a lot of nice features in-game. Despite this, it requires a LOT of major changes to become a much, much better game. I have heard from many veteran Robocraft players that this last update to the game has genuinely ruined it for most people. And from my own experience, I can see what they are talking about. While I find great quantities of joy in building and using the bots I make and duking it out with other people, I have found a few things that I find HIGHLY irritating.1: The loot crate system. I wish that instead of constantly winning things that I don’t necessarily want or need, I could progressively win items through a tier system... as I level up I unlock higher level items to correspond with my higher ranking.2: Being put in games with people who are much more powerful than I am... and paying the price for it. I have noticed that a lot of times I join a game, one side or another is not balanced with the other side- making it possible for one side to dominate the other for the entire match. It sucks the fun out of everything.3: Not being able to earn enough money through selling extra parts. While I do understand why they would reduce the selling price of parts after they've been bought or one, it seems to me that the prices are just too low. You end up making a quarter or less of what it would have cost to buy the part. It just seems unfair.4: Endless grinding only to ultimately not win anything that you actually need. This is closely related to the loot crate problem, but really only adds to that same frustration. While you might RARELY win something of value, it just doesn’t make up for the hours of play time spent. There needs to be some more consistency.5: Teslas are ridiculously overpowered. I have encountered, on countless occasions might add, players who equip nothing but high level teslas, a ghost drive, and a bunch of thrusters. While I must agree that it is an effective killing strategy, it appears that it is sometimes too effective. When they have enough teslas, they can wipe out entire teams in a matter of 60 seconds. Nerf the teslas, put a limit on them, SOMETHING to make them a little less brutal. Tesla players, when they have so much power, often ruin the entire game.In conclusion, I do absolutely recommend this game. But the next time you make an update freejam, please, please, PLEASE listen to your player. We want to help you improve your awesome game."
,Recommended,301520,29427837,Posted: 22 January,all,Mains_Cancer,"Perhaps one of the most fun Free-To-Play games i've seen in a long time.This game appeals entirely to those with an itchy trigger finger, and a creative mind.You can build ANYTHING, and slap a bunch of kick♥♥♥♥♥guns on it to boot.The first several matches can be frustrating, as you go up against seasoned players with a starting loadout(not as bad i had expected, but the lack of shield pieces is the biggest weakness), but with every match, win or loss, comes a lootcrate with new items to use or sell.Pros:-Fun and highly creative-Potential for organized team strategies-Matches are found quickly-Game runs very smoothly and i have yet to see a bug.-Inital loadout weapon-wise is pretty solid, and no items are locked behind paywalls. Premium just gives you a better chance of getting them.-You constantly receive new items from lootcrates.-You can sell any unwanted parts, buy specific parts, and both sell and buy pre-built robots made by community members. All without paying a dime(though it can go slow though)Cons:-No continuos lobbies-Ion weapons feel a tad overpowered.-Lack of shield pieces in the beginning means a rough few first matches.-Could use more maps and gamemodes.-Health is partly determined by number of cubes, so small bots tend to be inneffective in most cases if they are targeted.All in all, i highly recommend getting this game, and getting premium if you really like it.*This review will be occasionally updated as needed."

It might be hard to learn the game but once you get the hang of it is incredibly addictive and fun. It is also fun while learning how to play, because there are so many new items to discover :)Why I like it:Weekly updates that sometimes brings new bot parts, glitches, nerfing, buffing etc. This leads to various robot designs every update.It has simple graphics but looks good.The gameplay feels epic and you can spend of time designing your robot to be INCREDIBLE. Litterally some robots are too good!Very creative and you can take inspiration from the other robots in battle or from the factory.Devs are also incredebly friendly!Why some people don't like it:The main reason is CRATES. I am fine with crates but some people say it is a big deal to have a random award after each battle.The old game. I met Robocraft in 2014 and crates were not there. You got money after each match and the higher score you got, the more money! I can see why some people like that, since grinding feels more efficient.

Although it does have some 'minor' flaws, such as: The fact that you guys have a premium version (which is fine because you guys still need some money right?) although, why make it so premium gives you almost everything that you need to make a half decent robot without grinding for ages? i dont see any problem with the whole premium thing, it's just  a thing that bugs me and my friend (xXLionFishXx). And another thing, why would you make it so easy for some and so hard for other? what i mean is, why have a  winning system and a luck based system? my friend has 2 legandaries from a crate and i dont have any? i like the idea of needing some luck, but dont make you rely on luck as much (so make it so that you cant get legandaries). But overall, i love this game, i got it this week and i have already play 28 hours on it, which for a free game is very good and i would definately recomend it to my oth friends.Thanks for your time-yours faithfully, Stargater2/ Dave"

Some things that I think would make the game better would be to add game modes that not only promote teamwork, but also requires teamwork or the team would be penalized. Additionally, perhaps a game mode that has a slightly larger battle mode such as  8 vs 8. Lastly, I think that giving some type of bonus for players that play daily would definitely help the gaming community in this game grow.

More vs AI options, such as Party vs AI. Sometimes its just rage inducing when your playing Pvp, and some good ol' bot vs ai can be alot of fun!2. Customized Single Player/Party Play. being able to say how many players per team, and how many bots there are. This would be fun and cool if they had this!One other thing is that I looooove building in this game, and I like spending time on building things. But when you start off at a low level with not much flexibility for building, this can be kinda annoying. Even if there was just a mode for testing builds with no limits (other then cpu maybe) or a more easy starting building platform, it could be alot more fun for people who are new to the game and are maybe more on the ""I want to build stuff"" side!

,Recommended,301520,29430786,Posted: 22 January,all,Amarulence,"Alright, Robocraft.This review will be tailored towards the current versuin of Robocraft, and it meant to offer a different perspective to other popular reviews. Other reviews will tell you a lot more about the mechanics of the game and how they interact.Crates & PremiumIf you're looking to get into Robocraft, but you're not sure if you're looking to spend any money on it, then go free with the knowledge that yes, you can succeed in Robocraft without spending a dime.The basic guns are balanced to a point where a relatively new player can compete with the more experienced veterans as long as they put some time into understanding the concepts of building their robot.The problem arises when you want to purchasenewstuff.Robocraft now relies on a system of crates. How well you do in any given match determines what type of crate you get (you will also get the highest grade crate for leveling up). It seems like a good system at first, but the developerslock half of the contents of the crate, at random, to Premium only. This means to get the rest of the items dropped by the crate, you must purchase it.Now, what does this mean? It means that Premium is almost essential for getting new mobility, guns, etc.Items sell for 3x ""Robits"", the game's currency, while you have premium. Crates drop more items. You get more experience. Essentially, you must have Premium.Thegoodthing, however, is that while you can purchase Premium on a reoccuring schedule, you can also buy lifetime Premium for $50. I personally see the game as being mostly a demo, while paying $50 unlocks the ""full game"".Is the game worth $50? If this was a normal release, I'd price it at $40 maximum, but more reasonably $30. The crate system and the Robits system effectively bullies people into paying more money for the game than need be.As someone who has played without Premium for the majority of the game (over 95%), I do not believe this is fair, but I do not think this makes the game bad. Why? Well, the gameplay itself.GameplayWhile Crates and Robits impede advancement, it is possible to get far without spending a dime if you have the time, and all the issues with bullying aside, the game is remarkably enjoyable.I personally love the feeling of being able to customize my own robot and fight other robots on a large battlefield. The game modes are almost always exciting and fresh, especially with friends. The only time I've ever been discouraged is when a build of mine did not work out, and I'm essentially a sitting duck. But that's my own fault.Developer InputThe game is constantly being worked on, with new features and balance changes happening often. The developers take a lot of time to make sure their playerbase doesn't feel cheated on. If there's ever any unexpected server downtime, you can expect complementary Premium or something else as an apology.I've seen people complain about Freejam being haphazard when it comes to communicating with the community, but compared to other games, and especially ones withactualterrible communication, I think the developers do a pretty good job at giving back to the community.TL;DRThis game has problems, but it's still entertaining. I've had enough fun with it that through all the salt, rage, and ghost telsas, I'm still coming back. A game that offers that much replayability, in my opinion, deserves a recommendation.I hope this helped!"
,Recommended,301520,29796156,Posted: 8 February,all,Kid Ink,"Once upon a time, way back in the beginning of summer, actually from March to August, I liked this game.One could even say I loved it.But due to the many nerfs to weapons that they already did not need and buffs to bulkiness to massive or shield-obsessed builds, I became incapable of enjoying the use of my own bots.I did not play the game to 'be the best there ever was,' far from it, I played because I found that playing as otherwise nonsensical bots and being useful was fun.Such as playing as a blimp bombarding foes from high above, or as a literal pirate ship casting justice with sets of three cannons on each side, Port and Bow, or heck playing as a hovering chibi Gardevoir healing allies and assisting in damage!But the nerfs to all weapons and the buffs to insanely bulky builds crashed all that down into the dirt.My bots could no longer deal sufficient damage, and were still of the 'fragile' category.And no, I didn't build a 'bullet-type' bot, with bs 2-6 hovers, 2-4 boosters, and 1-2 low tier guns.I hated those.I would never stoop down to what I hate.But my creative, fun, and still mildly viable bots became utter trash and I could no longer do the only thing the game let me do with the bots- fight- with any sense of enjoyability.All the fun I had put into making the bots now just forces them to sit on a shelf, forever awaiting being booted up again.And it likely won't happen.Ever.I miss the days where creativity in this game was not punished, where instead the fun and silly low-tier robots could still assist in fights and look nonsensical in doing so.Pushing this 'either be the best or don't enjoy yourself' system ruined it for me.I'm not here to make the best bot.I'm not here to look, act, play or be mainstream.And I'm not here to stand out as an individual as a skilled fighter or crafty craftsman.I just want to take my thin slice of cake and savor it.I am, sad to say, glad I had not put money into this game when I had severely thought about buying a year's premium membership. It would have gone to waste two months in.I am, however, not saying the game should not be supported.Nor am I saying to withhold your own purchases.It's just that the niche for the creative-minded has been stomped on, and it doesn't look like it'll recover any time soon (if ever).It's all competitive now.And I've never been a competitive person.Overall, I cannot rate this game. I can point out where it had gone wrong for a section of the community to which I have no idea the proportion of, and I can point out how it can develop well into a single, limited niche.But games do not survive for long if competitive nature is the only thing they glue themself to.They must balance between casual fun and competitive capability.And this game's casual fun WAS its ability to be goofy and creative, to make whatever oddball creation you wished and to not be penalized for it.Now I cannot see anything casual about it.As with all revies, this was extremely subjective. Perhaps the absolute nerfs to guns being any less than top tier or 5+ was a smart one and I cannot fathom how such is. Perhaps the game was originally made to be competitive and the developers ended up making it too casual and creative. Perhaps dozens of potential suggestions one could give shouldn't be given because implementation or reversion would simply cause far too much alienation to be worthwhile options. I cannot tell, I am not the developers, and I am certain that they know how they want their game to go.And as to why I put it as 'Yes' for recommending this game, I would recommend trying this game, if only for a short time. If you find yourself enjoying the experience, then good for you, you've found a ftp game you can enjoy and, perhaps, support financially. However, if you dislike it, you can simply leave it be. It does no harm to give things a try."

I do have an Idea however. Maybe in a future update, you can add even smaller propellers and make some of them reverse thrust.

76561198017716467,Recommended,301520,29850506,Posted: 11 February,all,KickaBytes,Robocraft is about building a robot and then battling with it. When you first start you most likely will die alot my friend ffminecraft can attest to that. He soon found his playstyle and with what what parts he had made a bot that fit his playstyle (which turns out to be a small and speedy bot that is hard to hit unless you have plasma then it dies easily).The game is fairly balanced and every weapon can counter certain builds and other weapons. (like flak counters planes and copters while plasma counters small bots and teslas). The game is currently (at the making of this review) is going through a giant fail ditch which isn't that bad in my opinion. Also the Game Isn't even fully released yet so enjoy the bumpy ride(one thing that bothers me though is when people complain about dieing to their counter mainly its the flying bot players but i just deal with it)

The loot crates are incredibly broken, and unless you buy premium, it will take twice as long to get stuff and level up.Annother thing that can be incredibly annoying is the flying bots. bots with wings rarely fly on the first 50 edits. unless you have an incredible amount of luck or a guide, it can be very hard to make a flier without helicopter blades, though the planes (in my oppinion) are fun to fly.All in all, a fun and addicting game, but be prepared for dissipointment from loot crates."

76561198166294427,Recommended,301520,29792405,Posted: 8 February,all,Chunky Cake,"It's getting better. Teamwork is OP, so a gamechat option would be nice, as well as on-screen callouts like in CSGO.The energy curve is stupid and even as much variety as it brings to the game, too many people prefer itty-bitty bots.Perhaps the long forgotten proto-seekers can be buffed and as a high CPU and quick auto aim gun it can serve perfectly as the anti drone go-to. Then if we needed the power to run these then a big bot would not be optional with the high CPU cost. Lowering the CPU for more power reserves for the protoseeker would put it on drones.What I think is the best option is to keep the loot system the same no matter what CPU, and have a grid like matchmaking where you get put into skill based on your CPU. Allowing you to play at any CPU you want and still meet people of the same skill and CPU. So games with high CPU would be high DPS or very tanky or very fast and maybe a mix of the three, but having two is more effective. Low CPU games would be just the same, but to a smaller scale. And the grid-like matchmaking would make sure you always play against people in the same cpu and skill level, maybe you can make the game back into CPU rank matchmaking, and show a skill rank to see where you are on the boards. Perhaps a screen for where you are as a dot on this grid-like matchmaking system compared to all other players, perhaps in your area (east coast, west coast, australia, and all that other jazz), and be able to zoom into specific squares to see more detailed standings, not showing names, except your own pointed at the dot that represents you. and another problem, what about the players that left a long time ago? Well make it so that there's a time linit that you don't play a game in a week or so and your dot dissapears.I hope that freejam listens and at least gives one of these ideas a shot, if you are reading this, you're awesome. Oh yeah, and the game is cool, and I give it a thumbs up!"

The only problem about it is that you can't get a lot of it, then have to sell half of your stuff for a couple thousand which is easy to get, or have to repeatedly post your robot on the factory for a much better rate of people finding to buy it for maybe a thousand.

,Recommended,301520,29735248,Posted: 5 February,all,Peaches for Me,"Bot Creation: 8/10This, to me is the highlight of the game. The variables to take into account when building a bot is what makes it fun to me! I probably spend more time building and testing bots than I do in the fight. I've built some gnarly unstoppable monsters (of course they can be stopped), but I end up deleting them and building something else, because that's fun.That is the biggest advantage this game has; you're not going to always encounter the same bot design over and over again. Like you do with Overwatch, because they are pre-built 'bots' or characters, with absolutely no customization so people tend to use the same overpowered character in every fight.Combat: 10/10This is the other reason why this game is fun. The combat is supremely dynamic. The variety of bots lets you have to constantly change tatics. You don't just ""hit the head' or 'melee' [Melee is kind of a B/S instant kill]* to get instant kills. Some bots, in-fact most, are immune to instant kills. Those that can be instantly killed are terrible designs.Some Complaints:Now, with that praise out of the way. I HATE THE FACT YOU CAN BUY PREBUILT BOTS! Basically, expect to find really broken bots with every update, then you'll see a lot of them. Or the most common, none 'update broke the game' bot, you'll come across is a melee-blade-hover/flying bot that can go stealth and sometimes blink forward. It's immensely annoying to deal with, kind of ruins the game. It's a tatic that doesn't feel like you're giving the opponent a chance to fight. Just blink into existant and deal *MASSIVE* damage, most of the time resulting in a kill.*[Now, you can hear invisible bots. If you have legs and thus the ability to jump you have a chance to avoid it, but keep in mind; You will pretty much die unless you severly damage them in the next few seconds, which eliminates almost all weapons but plasma (gernade launchers) or shotguns. That's pretty much the only way to avoid an invisible melee bot...]Aerial combat *CAN* be fun, but flak cannons ruin aerial dominance pretty hard. IF you go against 1 good person with flak, your aerial units are screwed.They seriously need to nerf some of their items. Oddly, I feel their gimmick blocks need to be the same as they are but drop their CPU (robot level) value, their weight, and their cost. So that gimmicks are more universal, instead of being the sole focus of most bots who use them. Legendary items need to be made physically smaller.The Shotguns and Blades are seriously overpowered, to try and compensate for severe lack of range. They just need slight damage reduction or the blades need to cost more energy to use.Healing in this game leaves me wanting. (I really which they had single-shot healing guns and aoe heals. Aka, just make a gernade launcher heal and a sniper heal, then I'd be happy with the healing completly.) Also a boost ally damage or shields would be awesome too, but unessesary in my opinion.Freemium Content:Totally a good way to do it. In-short:When you buy premium (permantly is 50 bucks), you get access to more colors to paint your bots. Double the loot and experience from the matches. 3 times more credits for selling your bot components. There may be more things you gain with premium, but they're insignificant enough I don't remember.This feels fair to me; You can play the game for free, or you can buy it like a normal game would cost and you unlock a better experience to the game."

I think the max per group should be at least 3. For those who want to get this game I would suggest getting a tesla or mini gun bot, because they both do a lot of damage. Tesla bot is a melee type bot. Here are a few thing I like about this game the bots you make, you can sell for dust (You don't get to make the price). Like I said before this is a AWESOME game!"

Think Minecraft meets Overwatch and you'll have an idea of how it goes.My one gripe with it is that there's a very strong pay-to-win aspect, even moreso than most free-to-play games. The stuff that you can only hope to get by paying is so ridiculously over powered compared to the stuff you can reasonable expect to get through free play that it's almost like playing agaist cheaters.In most free-to-play games, at least the ones I've played, you at least have a chance to enjoy yourself if you're not putting money in. Not so with this game. When you come up against someone wearing premium colors rest assured that they're packing weapons that can drop you before you even know what's going on. So, basically, if you're going to play this game be prepared to spend a little money on it."

,Recommended,301520,29521478,Posted: 27 January,all,Blackjack #SPrayForVegas,"Review for Loading Simulator 1.0QUICK TIP:Use the starter bots, they're actually really good. Save ALL the parts you get for as long as possible, then buy Premium for 1 day to sell everything for 3 times the value. That's a low investment high reward strategy.The reason to why I play the game?I have money.TLDR: 10/10, great gameplay, controls, graphics but too much Pay2WinJokes aside, for those who aren't prepared to invest over 50 bucks for Prem4Life, this game isn't recommended.It has a beyond great concept and amazing gameplay.HOWEVER, saying this game is unbalanced would be an understatement.As someone who regularly spens money on games and not on actual life, it's really fun to build and drive whatever you want and try out other people's builds, but without premium, or any good starting weapons, it's just a pain to have to grind for hours to build a better bot to grind more efficently to THEN grind EVEN more to build the bot you actually want.Even WITH premium, it has taken me 32 hours to get an actually war-effective AND good looking bot from grinding in various gamemodes, and that's WITH premium. All in all, a great game, but without spending money, be prepared to grind for currency for a hundered hours or so before actually having a substantial robot garage.As for the developers themselves, I've heard all the posting about them not caring about their playerbase, and sadly I agree. Freejam doesn't seem to be wanting to revert the game to the state everyone seemed to love anytime soon.I weren't around back then, but from the looks of it, Old School Robocraft seemed to be the holy grail of fun arcade gaming.-Keep up the good work, Freejam, just remember that making a game is making a game, but managing a game is not managing a game, it's managing and keeping in good touch with the community as well.-To whoever is playing this: Stay strong; the game isn't finished yet!10/10, this game breaks:LogicsPhysicsPlayerbasesGamer heartsRulesFPSMinecraftAnd more!"

Now its stupid, the tesla dont have to recharge at all, weapon energy is stupid as well. Just put it back to how it was earlier but keep all the new blocks like propelors and put back the different levels of cubes you can get. However, I think that having 2 types of gun is okay otherwise anyone who plays as a healer would have to buy teslas and some people cant afford them. The new updates have really ruined Robocraft"

,Recommended,301520,29557734,Posted: 28 January,all,shingtaklam1324,"Edit 8 / 4 / 2017: So, my friend got me to play again, and I must say, that the game has changed. connection issues have been fixed, mostly, and the crate system, is interesting, as it promotes different builds by the players. The reintroduction of TDM is a correct choice, as it was the fan favourite game mode. Now it is much better. Recommend? Maybe//Previous Review from 2016 belowSo, how do I begin this? Well, I put in 500+ hrs into this game (most on the Robocraft Launcher), but then the devs pushed an update that ruined everything for me. Well, I guess it was growing pains for a game like this. When I started in 2013, the game had just came out, and it was fun, even for me with a rubbish connection, to play. Then the electroplates came out, which was a massive game changer, for the better in my opinion.When the nano came out, it changed everything.The game no longer relied as much on your own builds, but rather on the team composition and the ability of the medic.Then they added more gamemodes. Making it like a MOBA.Then I left the game."

I still get moments of frustruation, but that is mainly because of other players. But now that i have an extremely agile flying wing, life has been better. This game is great for experimenting with designs. Soon ill have a whole new level of stuff to mess around with. You just gotta take a break sometimes though. I hate how a beautiful and amazing performing aircraft can get shot down in 5 seconds by a poorly built bot with 2 flak and a chain shreddder as a dong. (Didn't happen but it can)  Actually the more i think about it  i really dont like/dislike this game really. I only like it to test designs but otherwise its not ideal.

[which is single person btw] he made many, many more, smaller mistakesRobocraft, might make you dont really feel like you progress, it might have horrible crate system, but it makes up with its diversity of weaponry and gameplay, which no game replicated even until today, but machinecraft? currently, all you can do are PROPS, because most of the things that make your machine work, are BROKEN, OR HORRIBLY LIMITED, while in Robocraft, there is no such thing, there is an actual balance, and developer team who still does make progressively better, and better updates.In Robocraft, the game is also extremely user friendly, its simple block by block building system makes it very easy to learn, and even for those who are still confused, there is the tutorialbut machinecraft? extremely hard to learn, and no tutorialsAnd here comes end of this review, i cut it short quite a bit, but i can again say that this game IS worth playing, compared to what i have experienced in last days.Update 1Today, after Aerofoils and Damage Boost updates, i return to update this review [yay!]Aerofoils update made the game pretty unbalanced, introducing Speed Boost which many people have exploited to achieve pretty unachievable speeds, but today the Damage Boost replaced the Weapon Energy, which was horrible idea from Freejam, now if you make a single cube with minimal movement and as example, new legendary Railgun, you can basically 1 shot most enemies, while max CPU crafts not only have no damage boost, but are also underpowered because of the current Weapon Energy which is precisely 12.550, which is allowing for i think 4 Plasma Devastator shots, while before i was capable of shooting around 15, making my jet underpowered compared to other enemiesalso, today because of single phrase where i didnt insulted anyone, i got silenced by as he said, ""lazy"" moderator for*drumrolls*INSULTING PEOPLE.the moderator said he was lazy, but he still did straight off silenced me instead of first reading what i said carefully, then responded ""i dont care"" when i told him to read my message carefully via private chat, instead of enGB where i got silencedi still could join the plPL or enUS chat, why didnt i did that? because of the players that are on themon plPL and enUS people are toxic idiots who care only about themselves and only like to insult normal people, while on enGB there are toxic moderators that dont give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about what you said, but instead silence you for what you didntremember Freejam, give moderator role to people who arent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s like this shitbag"
