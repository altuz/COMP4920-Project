,Recommended,301610,12157937,"Posted: 20 September, 2014",all,Chaonic,"Warning! This is a Review of a hobby artist. I have no clue about professional programs.The programs I used before are: GIMP, Photoshop CS6, Photoshop Elements, Paint Tool SAIAfter playing around with the program for a couple of hours I have to say... It's simple. But really, the best program, I have ever used to draw.It helps a lot, if you want to draw outlines. Especially with a graphics tablet. With the built in function to smoothen the lines, you will draw perfect lines around the second or the first time trying. In Photoshop, you have to make first a reaaally big picture and draw like this, so you can make it smaller afterwards to hide eventual wobbly lines.Or in SAI, you may be confronted with vector based lines, which are perfect, if you want perfect quality outlines. In openCanvas however, all you need is a stroke with your pen or mouse, and it already looks great.All the brushes are perfectly adjustable and easy to work with. I was really impressed by the kalligraphy pen, where it took less than a minute to adjust it to my needs, while in Photoshop, it took quite a while and didn't look good after all. Or maybe it was just my imagination. In fact, I was really impressed, how easy this little program works.I wasn't very sure, what to expect with the filters, when I saw them advertised on the shop page. But they have some really nice little filters, which can twirl the image, make waves, pixelize(mosaic), diffuse in a very smooth way etc. etc.The user interface is adjustable to the maximum. While it has similarities to how GIMP handles the many windows, it feels a lot more stable in handling and using.Now one thing, I wasn't really sure if needed. But it came in handy when using. Perspectives. You can practically adjust for very impressive static structures and visual effects. It is for sure damn good to use when you are a beginner and don't draw in perfect perspectives from the beginning of your picture. But I could imagine it to be also really handy for professional artists too.(I think, I will have much fun with it!)Rotating the picture as you need while drawing makes hard to draw lines easier and you don't have to turn your tablet upside down. Really nice to have this implemented. It is a far nicer rotation tool than GIMP, Photoshop or SAI. Also it is more handy.The last two things (And I am sorry to put the least good things in the end)You can add text. Well, every other tool I know has this feature. I don't know, why it is worth mentioning. But okay.And.. this is ACTUALLY really neat, if you think about it. The program itself takes up only 18MB. It makes it the smallest, but best program to draw, I own.Sure, I feel really hyped about this and I will update the review in a few weeks with a speed art and a much more settled opinion. But I hope you liked this review and it helped you considering to buy it. It is worth every dollar/euro/septim/gold coin or whatever you like to buy stuff with.Here are the prices of the porgrams compared:GIMP - freePhotoshop CS6 Standard - 699$Photoshop CS6 Extended - 999$Paint Tool SAI - 5400 Yen (Around 50$ And no, it is NOT freeware)openCanvas - 49,99$If you have questions or want to correct me, just comment and I will try to answer it, correct it or add it to the review if important.Edit #1:As I am not sure, why my ""play time"" is so low, I was quite busy with it.There are actually some bugs, you should be aware of.- Your stylus may not be recognized after using the arrows to scroll on your drawing. This isn't really a big problem, but can be really annoying after a few hours. You can also solve it by either Alt+Tab out and in again, or by drawing a line with your normal mouse.- Sometimes, you are not able to load up a .psd file. If you want to keep working on a picture, you have to copy every layer, save it as a separate picture and import it to OpenCanvas. This happened to me only once after switching very often between Photoshop and O.C.Rather use .ociIf you find yourself having the same issues, consider reporting the bug.End of Edit #1"

I`ve figured I have logged in enough time to spread the word on this.Pros:- ENDLESS ammounts of things to learn and do (still finding things even now)- You think of it, you can do it- Easy for any type of artist, be it novice to the next Da Vinci- LAYERS LAYERS OH SWEET GOD THE LAYERS- All the diffrent changes you can make to the pens and layout to suit your styleCons:- The constant ammount of times an access violation occurs......- Also the times that said violation can occur because of your tablet.....- Depending on your computer, It`ll lock up and not save (rare occasions and an easy fix)- (In my experience) the sheer lack of (understandable) tutorialsOther than the few cons, I would highly recommend this software!  It`s a great peice if you`re looking about to work, have fun, or generally make fun of your constantly angry co-worker two desks away with cartoons of themselves. Alot of the errors and such that occur are really easy, yet sometimes very annoying, fixes.I hope this helps you in your endevor to finding that software to help your imagine soar, and to get those annoying school projects more fun."

My biggest problem was that they were too complicated to use. openCanvas is everything you need packed with many functions, yet uses a simple Interface.There are brushes like Pencils, calligraphy pens, air brush, and pastels. Also there are pen nibs for almost everything. You can, for example, change the brush size, Opacity and spacing.However, if you don't have any experience in digital painting, you can download event files fromportalgraphics.netand replay them. In that way you can learn from other people's drawing methods.The first time drawing with a tablet might be difficult for most people who are used to traditional pens. But if you spend a decent amount of time, you will get better. Even if your first drawings are not very good, it's fun when your skills start to improve."

,Recommended,301610,13708456,"Posted: 30 December, 2014",all,LoneWolfDon,"Hi all.I had this software on my wishlist for a while and I just grabbed Open Canvas 6 (OC6) during the 2014 Christmas sales on Steam.I've been dabbling with it, experimenting and teaching myself how to use it.Before I mainly used GIMP for doing graphic-editing (using GIMP feels more like work, but using OC6 I find is fun), so jumping into Open Canvas was fairly easy and intuitive to become familiar with it (though I'm still learning lots as I go).Overall I'm quite impressed with OC6, it's many features and ease of use.Checking out the main website athttp://www.portalgraphics.net/en/, and the Community section, I was quite impressed with some of the beautiful works-of-art I seen posted by some of the Artists there. Really, there's some great stuff there, and in part looking over the various art there inspired me to get OC6.One of the features I also really liked is that for some art pieces there (in the PGN Community), that the event-file can be downloaded, open and played within OC6, so I can actually have a good idea of how some Artists approached and created their art, which can give me some new ideas and inspirations in making my own art-pieces too.I look forward to being part of the Open Canvas Community.* Dec.31.2014, a little update:Just thought I'd mention that yesterday I picked up a Wacom drawing-tablet. Though it will take me more practice to become better and more comfortable at using it, I've been playing around with it for a while and so far it seems to work really good and responsive with Open Canvas.If interested, you can take a look at a video I made of drawing in OC6 and of my first art-piece I did using a drawing-tablet (with my own music I composed playing in the background too):http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=367874303I also like that the tablet is pressure-sensitive and that OC recognizes that as well so my pen-strokes also draw with a lighter or heavier line accordingly. I have a much finer level of control now (compared to using a mouse for drawing) and In a lot of ways it almost now feels like 'real' sketching or painting. I think having the drawing-tablet and using it with Open Canvas will help to more bring out my 'inner artist'.  Cheers! :)"

I just migrated here from Paint Tool SAI and I am very, very pleased.First, having an illustrator is extremely useful in a steam library considering you do not have to renew your liscence incase the computer it's installed on finds a way to break.  Cracks as well are extremely difficult to maneuver, as well as illegal and immoral, so it is nice having a secure program in my library and being legally clean.Also, this program is about as lightweight as paint tool SAI, and much lighter than Photoshop and Corel Painter Pro.  Its UI is very similar to photoshop's window layout, however, and has a very easy learning curve from anyone that's used adobe anything.  It is way less complicated and more professional looking than GIMP, and way more useful than Paint Tool SAI.This program is a must have.  Some people have problems running this software however.  I haven't, a lot of people also haven't, and it'll stay in your library if it doesn't work anyways, so I'm recommending it."

It doesn't exactly matter if it's about a TV Show, Anime, a person, or whatever. I think we can agree some fanarts are pretty amazing. This program is definietly powerful enough to make your imaginations into a pictures. Simply put, this program is easy yet hard. It's easy to get into and learn what all the tools are and their various uses, but it's extremely hard to master. As I said before, this is the first program I've ever used, I'm not exactly artistic but playing with this makes me want to change that.Pros:-Easy to learn.-Simple-Nice Layout-Tools are extremely well made.-Extremely helpful community.Cons:-Somewhat new software, not many guides/videos.-Maybe cost?There may not be many guides but buying this will make the program more popular, more popularity equals more videos and guides and all that good stuff.New to art? Better buy a 50$ software!50 dollars may seem to be a lot but compared to Adobe's photoshop or any others which are in the hundreds 50 dollar doesn't seem as much. In my opinion it's worth every penny.Definietly a great program. I reccomend it to just about everyone."
,Not Recommended,301610,32682151,Posted: 23 June,all,Sunny Senpai,"App just crashes hard on launch if I connect my tablet(Ugee M708), maybe because it fails to read the pressure sensitivity and gives me an 'Access Violation' error. However it works fine with my mouse though, yea it's incompatible with my tablet but I have tried many apps before and I never had this kind of problem. This is the only software it's incompatible with.I tried the support but there is no working solution for it, because it looks like many have faced this problem way back when this software came to steam(2014)and they gave up on it and moved on to other applications because of lack of support. Sad to see that the devs are neglecting this. Also the main support forum is onlyavailablein Japanese at the moment and English forums are on the way but it will take time.This might be a great application, without any subscription unlike majority of the similar apps out there, it's light in weight(6 MB lols), has neat set of tools at your disposal, but the lack of support from devs completely outweighs the pros. Once you buy this app, make sure it supports your tablet without any kind of incompatibilities, otherwiserefundit asap.The only reason I bought this on steam is because I really wanted to see how much time I will be investing in drawing stuff."

It's undoubtedly can make professionalartworks if you are good enough. Still has some rough edges (feel more like late beta than finished product).Yet the price is reasonable, if you are interested in digital painting but not ready to throw big money atother applications, this is a pretty good start for beginers too."

Well because now i have a more deep knowledge of the Ilustration tools in Photoshop AND canvas and there are some tools that still can be improved, for example would be nice if we can have the ""channels"" tool that exist in photoshop, because that one is insanely useful for Sketch Lifting, thing, that you can't do in canvas, also the warp tool (here we only have the free transform tool) and maybe more brushes but that's more a community issue than the company itself (just consider that the photoshop default brushes are not as good as the custom [made by the community] brushes)"

Photoshop is still my go to program, since I'm more familiar with it, but Open Canvas got stylus stabilizer options, which will make inking easier, there are also other brush options I really like in Open Canvas compared to PS CC, but those might vary in use from person to person, in which case like so many other drawing/painting programs, there are many great ones out there, and there really isn't any evil, in trying or using more than one. But you if you are searching for something to directly replace PS CC, I don't think this is it, nor do I believe there is any, for that matter.This program will however offer a more focused drawing experience, with tools to greatly help you save time, when it comes to just sketching, drawing, inking, and painting.It also has an event log, like a big history log, which is possibly a great tool, for step by step, seeing and understanding, what exactly the artist did to create, like watching over their shoulders, opens up for faster understanding of advanced methods, if shared."

""not sure if there is a snap option, couldn't find one""i also don't know how to create solid lines for lets say outlines? i do like how it has shading around the lines, it's just for certain things it's not needed and it makes using paintcan/ rub or smearing effects annoying.even with all my inexperience and minor noob issues that probably aren't even issues. i still highly recommend this software to experienced and inexperienced users."

Having tried GIMP, SAI, and even PS, leaving each rather frustrated and disapointed; this is a much easier program to learn and use. It took no time at all to take a sketch from paper to inking it over and adding a palette of colors.The layers function similiarly to PS, simply right click to add a new one, and it helps when trying to break a piece down, bit by bit. Especially given how I prefer to draw my stuff on paper and then transfer it over.

Nice layout, simple tools and has a great sort of colour-mixing brush setting which is fantastic for painting and blending colours together. I would recommend this program at it's full price, but if you get a chance to catch it on sale, just do it. You won't regret it.

You probably be happy with only using free programs, such as GIMP or Medibang, or FireAlpaca, even BigCanvas.Second, It crashes. On Nvidia 720. And I have no idea what else it will work. Yes, I know Windows is not the best tool for drawing, a mac or linux would probably better but seriously, I never had this problem with a DRAWING TOOL. If this one crashes, Photoshop would probably destroy my computer.Basically, don't waste money on this. Go buy Sai or CSP, Photoshop even if it's expensive. Just don't touch this thing ever. Go play with other ones, even if this one is on sale. Just, don't get any closer to this program, with a quality like that, you can never be considered professional, and I'm not even talking about the weigh of this. Just, try other ones, even if they are free, and you will be A LOT happier, believe me.EDIT; I tried using again and I decided something; I prefer a pet tentacles to this."

The program is an ok program to use, it has a decent inking pen and doesn't take up too much space. It has a fairly easy to understand interface but the tools have a steep learning curve due to weird pressure sensitivity. One of the biggest problems is that the program tends to lag a lot after using it for a while, using some brushes or tools too much, and even crashing. This won't stop you too much from drawing since it doesn't seem to affect everyone but it will make it more difficult to complete drawings. The tools don't really add anything new and are pretty basic so you might struggle with complicated or realtic drawings. You may have to be a bit more expirenced to really be able to understand and properly use the program. The main flaw is that this program is extremely over priced, there are many other art programs that you could get for free that could do the same things as this program and possible do them even better. Not to mention there are other art programs that are either inexpensive, equal to, or slightly more expensive than this program that could be better or more refined."
