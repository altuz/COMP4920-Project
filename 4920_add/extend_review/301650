,Recommended,301650,22501420,"Posted: 18 April, 2016",all,BeauChaotica,"Edit: Protip #1 - Bunny hop. Protip #2 - RAVE GUNThis just kicked my nostalgia into overdrive. The teams at Big Boat and Rebellion have done a grand job bringing the shine back to this gem from the late 90s. The new lighting and particle effects, as well as high-poly models and hi-res retextures bring the magic back to the current generation.After the first samples of a mysterious material known as 'bio-metal' fell to Earth in 1952, the two major superpowers facing off in the cold war - the USA and the USSR - utilised it to construct amazing new prototype vehicles and weaponry. Ever seeking greater sources of power, this whole new world of technology spawned from the stars spurred on humanity's thirst for the untapped resources of deep space...One of the early [and sorely missed] action-strategy hybrid titles, Battlezone's first campaign casts you into a conspiratorial wing of the United States military - the National Space Defence Force (NSDF) - which is expanding out into the solar system during the cold war. The USA has used the smokescreen of the highly publicised Space Race to deploy a division of their military forces on the moon. What is this strange, otherworldly bio-metal scrap? Can such a malleable and strong substance really form naturally? All that truly matters at the outset is keeping it out of Russki hands at all costs...In the second campaign, you play from the perspective of a Russian cosmonaut on the other side of the conflict. The differing design philosophies of the two factions is striking. The Soviet Cosmos Colonist Army (CCA) favours brutal head-on attacks and overwhelming numbers. Beginning with much the same immediate goals in mind as the USA (though initially more intrepid and bold in their conquest), the USSR expand rapidly to the Red Planet. Of course, not all is as it seems, and the cosmonauts quickly find themselves wishing they were safely home in the Motherland's bosom, for the cold of space is not inviting, and grander things lurk just out of sight...--A great piece of alternate history fiction with excellent gameplay values. You can jump in and out of any given hover-vehicle to wander around on the surface of many planets and moons around Sol. With your trusty sniper rifle, you can whack hostile pilots from a distance and jack their ride, if you so choose. The combat is frenetic and satisfying, driven by the desire for ultimate control over these new resources. Perhaps the most gratifying element of this game is the fluidity of its movement. The jet-thruster-powered movement of most of the vehicles allows for some spectacular handling of rough terrain, cruising along at high speed and ramping off outcroppings of rock, lending the game abundant z-play opportunities. Moving effectively and working as a team is absolutely as crucial as landing hits on target.In many missions (as well as the instant-action and multiplayer[!!!]), designing, constructing and managing your base falls to you. The bio-metal is extremely versatile and can be used in conjunction with a Recycler vehicle to construct all manner of buildings, vehicles and bizzare, devastating weaponry, ranging from tanks and mobile turrets to howitzers, rocket platforms and walkers. You will need to protect your scavengers, deploy your battle lines and make offensive strikes on enemy positions, all the while keeping track of the number of pilots you have at your disposal, and that ever-crucial supply of bio-metal scrap. You can manage every unit in your force, every building and utility vehicle under your command, from anywhere on the very sizeable maps using the fairly intuitive command interface.Strategy and tactics evolve organically lending the gameplay as much or as little head-on action as you please, requiring you to source scrap fields and expand your production line and deny those same resources to your enemy. Your co-pilots are as effective in combat as you are, and you'll need all the help you can get throughout the challenging campaign.Pick this up, it's probably quite unlike anything else you'll play this year, and you won't regret it."

Have just played the first couple of missions and am just blown away. It feels like the old BZ we know and love BUT it looks amazing. It's the little things that create a much more emersive experience like: better physics when you hit an enemy (when I saw that fighter dip and struggle - epic), explosions, enhanced lighting, particle effects, headlights, terrain and sky, and on and on.It may just be me, but it 'feels' like the enemy AI is smarter. They react to my strafing better and seem much more accurate (smart) - OR I could just be imagining that :-) I haven't tried any mulitplayer options yet, but that is coming soon.There was a lot of love put into this version and it shows.

Now, you have to go to Mars to establish a base among the CCA already stationed there, until you find evidence of an ancient alien race and their ancient tech that could make or break space forever. As a time piece game, it's a ""Cold War-gone-Hot"" based game with some 1984-level cleansing to make sure the public never knows and, to be fair, it's one of the better games to execute the story. 9/10Graphics: The graphics look pretty damn awesome. Playing it from a N64 version, the graphical advantage is apparent and it does do a lot of what it needs to do in order to be a redeluxe version of the 1998 classic. 9/10Controls: To me, the tanks control like lubed up bananas on a wax floor like they participated in the Indy 500 (which does make sense considering they're hovering tanks), but the controls for ordering your troops or base around to any potential power source works well enough. 8/10Music and Sound: Both are recycled from the original '98 version, but it would have been cool if the voice lines were updated with new voice actors, but add in the touches needed to make it sound like the originals. While I could just leave it at a 6.5/10 and get on with it, the fact that the music and a lot of the in-game sound can be replaced with mods is the reason I'll give it a 7.5/10.Overall and mentions: As a person who has only seen footage of Battlezone 98 and had some trouble with Rise of the Black Dogs on the N64, I was disappointed to see how such a hyped game resulted in something relatively obscure. It's not exactly a diamond in the rough, but it is definitely something like a ruby in the rough. I hope that it does get more players, though most people will still decide to download the original 1998 game. 7.5/10 because it's not a bad game, but it does have some issues that could make it overlooked. However, I still would like to recommend it to people so they can try it out for themselves."

,Recommended,301650,22697070,"Posted: 28 April, 2016",all,ScrapPool,"This is the best game you've never played. It's the hidden gem of hidden gems.Set in an alternate 1960s where the space race is just a cover for a cold war turned hot, the United States and Soviet Union secretly deploy massive armies into space in pursuit of an extra-terrestrial substance,bio-metal, that can be used to craft amazing and powerful weapons of war. The National Space Defense Force (NSDF) and Cosmos Colonist Army (CCA) do battle over control of thebio-metalthroughout the solar system using hover tanks crafted from the precious material. Battlezone has some of the best sci-fi lore of any game- don't skip over the briefings and debriefings!Battlezone has always had interesting gameplay because of the way it blends RTS and FPS elements. You primarily play the game from the view of the cockpit of your hover tank: you can hunt down enemy craft yourself and blow them away, OR, you can deploy yourrecycler(main production unit) at a nearby geyser power source and being collectingbio-metalusingscavengersin order to build a base, defensive structures, and wingmen to take into battle with you. If you build a Comm Tower, you can take a satellite view of the battlefieldzone and command your wingmen in traditional RTS style, but you don't need to have a Comm Tower to effectively command all of your units (in fact, most often it is better to NOT take this approach).Battlezone 98 Redux (BZR) has received many improvements over the original game. These include highly improved terrain textures, models, lighting, menus, and more, and these alone make the game worth a purchase and play through. However, because BZR is built on the code of the 1998 release, some of the baggage from years ago has made its way into this game. The net code, though improved, still struggles from time to time, and having a good connection can be important to having an enjoyable online experience. (Overall this is has never been a problem for me, though.) The sound system also struggles mightily when there are many units in play or in a battle- it will eventually just choke and cut out completely until there are fewer units. The sound cutting out is a scenario that you're for the most part unlikely to encounter during regular gameplay, however.Keeping these small qualms in mind, the game is absolutely a steal at its current price, and will buy you hours and hours of fun in space. I SAID FUN IN SPACE!If any 90's game deserved a Redux, this was it. Especially if you never played the original (but even if you have!), this is a must buy.10 Grizzlies out of 10."

One might argue that the graphics could've been even further improved and whatnot, but that's neither here nor there. As single-player the game plays the same as the original, and the original being one of my favorite games of all time, that's not exactly a bad thing! I haven't touched the multiplayer side yet, but will definitely check it out as well as the available tools for content creation.So far probably my biggest annoyance has been friendly unit AI, mainly scavengers which seem to have horrid pathing and constantly get stuck, for example in the second Mars mission. But I can't honestly remember if they were this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the original too.All in all if you liked the original, this makes it run and look that much nicer on modern computers and is definitely worth it, and for those who haven't tried the original it's still worth checking out in my opinion. I really hope they'll do a redux of Red Odyssey as well as Battlezone II too!"
,Recommended,301650,22531172,"Posted: 20 April, 2016",all,The Last Battleborn Player,"Let's think about this for a moment here.The story involves The Cold War cover up where the actual battles took place all over space. Space tank space race.The gameplay is an incredibly well thought out combination of a squad based fps shooter with command and conquer-esque rts elements which has only been done just a few times, none of which has come close to Battlezone in execution.Because let's face it, there is no reason to attempt it again. It was done perfectly the first time and all future attempts will fall short of greatness.The base building is satisfying as you go from a small recycler to a full-on citadel of gun turrets and mines as you balance a need to finish off the mission as well as keeping your scrap intake moderated so you do not inadvertantly starve yourself of resources. That's where the first-person squad based gameplay comes in. There are a wide variety of different tanks to choose from with a varying degree of playstyles between them, starting from a nimble and weak Scout/Fighter to a slow, powerful Walker/Golem. Bread and butter Tanks to niche fillers such as Rocket Tanks and Bombers to tackle specific situations that may arise as you fight over a planet. No one tank feels completely useless and all feel as if they can be useful in a one-on-one fight if used/maneuvered correctly. If you choose that the fps gameplay isn't exactly your sort of thing, there exists more traditional RTS elements through satellites that give an overhead view of a map where you can micromanage your tanks effectively rather than blow things up yourself.It is legitimately my favorite game, and now it has an HD remake and runs perfectly on a modern PC.This game and all it offers deserves a playthrough, because it never got a fair shake when it initially came out. Think about it for a moment, Atari released boatloads of reboots of their old franchises and most of them were terrible because it did not do anything remotely interesting. Along comes another old arcade reboot which served as the antithesis of everything Atari was churning out. It not only features the badass story that hooks you on its sheer craziness, the gameplay has also aged incredibly well.Infinite recommends, you should play this and experience one of the most unique games to come out of the 90s. As jaded as I've become over video games along comes this one title I fawned over as a child which shows me that yeah, video games are still pretty great, and Battlezone is just as unique and entertaining as the day it came out.Battlezone revealed to me that I love video games, and it deserves to be your favorite game, too."

It has the same sounds, levels, campaigns, weapons, vehicles, and maps as the old game. So far, the only way it's better is that more people play the multiplayer, the graphics are a lot better, and you can make your own mods or maps and upload them to the Steam Workshop. All-in-all, good enough for the money."

,Recommended,301650,22555664,"Posted: 21 April, 2016",all,Chino,I’ve always been a big fan of this game and now it’s on steam with a new remastered visuals and mods… just another great reason to play it again.
,Recommended,301650,22503464,"Posted: 18 April, 2016",all,CommissarBRO,"So as someone who has never played Battlezone but is a huge fan of action-strategy games, you'd think this would've absolutely blown my mind. After about 2-3 hours, I'm not so sure. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's bad, as far as a remaster goes, this is how it should be done... mod support, working multiplayer, ability to download new maps for instant action, graphical enhancements etc... this is a damn good remaster. I think my problem is truly just expectations. As someone who has heard about how amazing this game is and how it's pretty much the best action-strategy game to be released, all I can do is compare it to Uprising: Join or Die and how different philosophies they both are.Battlezone is slower, controls are floaty (because low gravity and hover tanks), units can be controlled directly and vehicles are all interchangeable with the player. You've also got 2 resources, scrap (metals) and pilots (nonrenewable). Scrap is gathered by scavengers from deposits all over the map and blowing up enemy units (or your own) creates scrap that can be scavenged and reused. Pilots are a nonrenewable resource, you need one for every unit you build. If the unit blows up, the pilot is ejected but he can also be killed thus losing him for good. If he makes it back to base, then your limit is not affected. It should also be noted that units have multiple weapon types and it doesn't seem like anyone is overly good against anyone else. Seems like numbers win the day in battles (from what I've played so far). This game also punishes you for your stupid teammates and makes you feel like you're just another soldier except you call in units.Uprising: Join or Die on the other hand is more arcadey. It's fast-paced and operates more on a paper rock scissors format. Infantry beats building, Tank beats Infantry, Aircraft beats Bomber and Tanks, Bomber beats building, Building good against everything etc etc. It's more simplistic. Units cannot be directly controlled, they are called in and proceed to battle against any enemy within the area but after the battle can be recalled to gain back resources. Your tank is also your ultimate weapon, it can be upgraded with better weaponry and by the end of the game you'll be blasting away foes with about 12 different weapon types.  Your tank can also divert power to 3 areas, shields, weaponry or speed... making you take more damage, deal more damage or zip around the battlefield at ridiculous speeds. Buildings are called in on pads rather than you essentially placing them whether you want (except for turrets). It should also be mentioned that Uprising is brutally hard, but not because your allies are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... rather you made a mistake and they capitalized on it. I could go on but I believe my point is clear.Here we have two different action-strategy games that took the genre and walked opposite ways with it yet still remained true to a couple of different concepts (like having a command tank).In summation, Battlezone 98 Redux is good for those who are looking for more of a slower paced, punishing game... Battlezone is your game. If you're looking for a twitch shooter that plays more like The Outfit, then Uprising: Join or Die is your game. I still believe this should be played by anyone who is a fan of action-strategy games!"

,Recommended,301650,33154490,Posted: 2 July,all,Half life Expert,"This nostalgia galore. Battlezone revived for modern computer systems! This is a dream come true for fans of this classic.If you played the old Battlezone from 1998, this will feel very familiar to you. The sights and sounds are practically the same, but the graphics are upgraded from the original release. There is little reason to not get the Red Odyessy as well.If you haven't played Battlezone before, here is the basic premise:In 1952, a metor shower rains down around the Bering Strait between Alaska and the USSR. The meteor remains, which are collected by the US and the Soviets, contain strange material that is named Bio-Metal. This material allows both superpowers to be able to make massive leaps in thier technology, far beyond even today's tech, although the general public is kept in the dark.Fast forward to 1969, and the Apollo 11 mission lands on the moon, Basically the Space Race as we know it still happens as a cover. The real space race is what the story focuses on. Before Apollo happens, the US has already established a military presence on the moon, using very advanced technology and vehicles derrived from the Bio-Metal. In fact, during the first mission, you see one of the Lunar landers.However, the USSR also lands military forces on the moon, called the Communist Cosmonaut Army (CCA) on the moon, and attack the US forces, which are called the National Space Defense Force (NSDF).   The story takes off from there, with missions taking place around the planets and moons of the solar system, not Earth though.  There is also a campaign where you play as one of the Soviets.Additionally, the Red Odyessy DLC, back then called an expansion pack, takes place on Ganyemede, one of Jupiter's moons, with the NSDF fighting the People's Republic of China, which has also obtained Bio-metal from meteors. Their space forces are called the Chinese Red Army (CRA). The Chinese have there own unique units, and are not completely allied with the Soviets, reflecting the real life Sino-Soviet split. There is one campaign for each side in this DLC as well.The game itself is a hybrid of real time strategy/tactics and first person vehicle combat.You control your vehicle and it's weapons, taking part in combat, but also command friendly units, as well as building bases and collecting Bio-Metal (the only resource, which can be found scattered about the maps or can be taken from the wreckage of destroyed units).Each side has a variety of vehicles, which you can change during a level. Hitting the 'H' key has you hop out of your vehicle and able to get in another one. You also eject automatically when your vehicle is destoryed. While outside the vehicle, you are basically an Astronaut infantryman with a plasma rifle. You are extremely vulnerable in this state.  So get in another vehicle ASAP.Don't fool yourself, This is a challenging game. This is from a time when games were more challenging to complete.If you are up for a challenge and want to try something different from more recent games, get this and enjoy yourselves!"

The remaster feels just like the original version in gameplay, but also improves on many areas including smarter AI units, updated graphics, and even adds cooperative multiplayer against an AI.It should be noted that I have experienced some FPS drops and there is a problem with the game closing if trying to Alt+Tab while in a multiplayer match.

Battlezone 98 Redux is great, just great, and I urge anyone seeing this to get it, for starters, it has everything you loved about the original Battlezone with an addition of updated graphics, almost nothing else has been changed, except for the addition of Mods, some of which I don't have but can highly reccommend you get as well.  One mod is the replacement of the music with the music from the N64 port of Battlezone; Battlezone:  Rise of the Black Dogs.  I loved the music from the port and now that someone has remade the music with better sound quality, it will surely fit in with your experience.  The only thing that I have any problem with (This includes the original game as well) is the extreme gameplay difficulty spike when you hit medium.  Maybe it's just me, but I've never experienced a spike like this, it must just be that 90's difficulty.

The mixture of FTS and FPS gameplay in a compelling and amusing cold-war era crypto space war made this game stand out. It's still as challenging and entertaining now as it was 20 years ago. The  only down side to this game is that the genre it should have spawned was stillborn - Strategy games almost all take place from a god's eye view and first person games rarely attempt any strategic gameplay in this manner.

Do not regret.It's quite a change from BZII in some ways, but it's enough the same that adapting to these differences was easy enough, and boy was it worth it. The gameplay is so nostalgic it almost hurts (I shamelessly admit I did cry a little when I first started playing), and it helped patch holes in the story for me, having only played BZII prior.It's a fun challenge, and, as far as I'm aware, a rather unique style of gameplay that I've never really seen replicated outside of BZII (the combination of the RTS base-building, unit-commanding with the FPS player-controlled unit is an element I just love to bits, yet I can't think of any other games that utilize it).Would I recommend the game?

FPSRTS games are a rare breed, and most of them are utter trash. This one is interesting though. The vehicles control quite well, and the command interface is pretty clear and easy to use, and the hud makes me need new pants. Seriously, not enough games understand that giving players a proper cockpit view of their vehicles make us immediately like the game like at least 30% more. My only complaint is that a lot of keybindings are locked permanently, so if you want to say, bind jump to spacebar, you're SoL because that's permanently bound to commanding your units. However, thankfully most of the controls that are locked are locked to logical keys. Targetting a unit, for example, is T. Can't be changed, but doesn't really need to. Also, for some reason the game doesn't recognize left alt as a valid key to bind things to for some reason.

To this day I can remember it all.Some of my best memories are of playing this with my dad and his friends and the journey it took me on as i developed my skills and mindset towards becoming Better and better,  Every match utilized a different  strategy there were so many different vehicles and weapons loadouts you could use that it provided endless challenge and excitement Even though I lost almost every match,Just as the year ended I donned a New mantle that would come to be my gamertag(ReaperX2000).Moments before the new millennium I defeated My father and his friends in a brutal day wrecker victory I built and ammased an army of scouts and an armory quickly hunting down my opponents by carefully placing my troops i ejected so i could overlook the enemy base, launching 2 day wreckers onto seperate targets so the blasts would overlap and cause the most  widespread havoc,I waited with my sniper prone trained on whatever red dot i could find as the bombs reached the peak of thier arc i waited anxiously counting down the moments before they would be in range, as they approached just above his base i took the shot sniping one of his scavengers to draw his attention.Perfect, Just as he had time to turn around the bombs dropped destroy his entire offensive wing most of his scavengers and almost all of the buildings lay in critical condition.""Time to send in the dogs."" I ordered my wing of scouts to attack his recycler, it was a crushing blow, as the scouts many miniguns quickly lay waste to what was left of Dads installer buddy.  I quickly ordered my scavengers and a couple defense turrets into the area to collect the salvage, It was time to take on the real threat, Dad himself.My attack had been successful but in order to accomplish this task i had left myself open to attack at my original base, Fortunately i had already tucked my recyler away in a different geyser, calling it and the constructor it had built i quickly began raiseng defences for my new base, i built several powerplants and guntowers surrounding and plugging the perrimiter turrets,I had recyled most of my scouts and sent a few to scout for the enemy repurposing all the metal i could find into tanks and walkers, and of course switching to my own walker with my favorite choice of weapons,(Flash & Mag <3) Dad had already utilized the time to construct his own army of tanks but he lacked defensive structures, With my earlier attack run i had gained advantage by collectiong far more scrap far quicker, He put up a good fight, Our tanks clashed in a battle of explosions for what seemed like an hour. But in the end my resources allowed me the victory, Sending in wave after wave of tanks as i established defenses on his doorstep to reclaim my lost scrap, Eventually he lost out and I claimed Sweet Sweet Victory.This victory would be the driving force to push me to succeed in any and every video game,Memories of the different odds i have overcome would give me the confidence to take on any new challenge,And the theme of this game would place space simulators action and strategy games in a special place in my heart.My 7 Year old Mind would grow to use battlezone as the basis to judge every game upon, And to this day, No game i have ever played,(And I have played ALOT) compares to matches in this game,This to me, is simply the best game that was ever made, and seeing it here in steam(WITH MODS!!), remastered beautifully, Leaving the real joy to this game completely untouched, Because it was just so masterfully done the first time. is a dream come true,I would reccomend this as a 10 Out of 10 But this game is so wonderful it would simply take its score Divide by zero and multiply by infinity, Not only do I reccoment this game, this is THE game I reccomend For gamers at any point in thier livesThank you for reading.TL;DR: Buy this game, It could change your life.P.S.

76561198290161320,Recommended,301650,34895353,Posted: 11 September,all,Arskov,"THE LEGACY IS BAAAAAAAAACK!!!!!!!!I cannot stress how happy I am with this game. I've been playing (not to mention making mods for) the Battlezone franchise since my childhood, and while BZ2 expanded and improved on the original in almost every way the original Battlezone holds a special place in my heart, forever and always. And I am positively thrilled to report that this reboot is the very same Battlezone I came to adore back in the 2000's, albeit with improved graphics and performance.Now, an un-biased review!First off, graphics. The graphics are, indeed, more than a little dated. This still looks like the game that came out in 1998. That's not to say that it looks bad or anything. It just don't hold up compared to modern games, so if you're looking for something as gorgeous as Crysis 3 you'd best look elsewhere. The reboot did do a wonderful job of reworking the terrain and textures, giving the game sharper details and clearer imagery while keeping the retro look and feel of the original.Next, gameplay. Where to freakin' start?! Not much has changed between the original and the reboot in this department. Gameplay is the original fast-paced RTS/Shooter hybrid, centering around the fleet of hovertanks you have at your disposal. Build a base, gather resources, build and command your army, all while dogfighting with enemy forces behind the controls of any one of the numerous vehicles at your disposal, from quick and nimble scout craft to meaty tanks to lumbering and terrifying walkers. Outfit your vehicle and your wingmen with a selection of conventional and futuristic weapons like anti-tank cannons, heat-seeking missiles, lasers, or that damn Thumper (an earthquake gun of all things).The controls are rather intuitive for such a hybrid game. Sure, there are a few things that might throw off modern gamers (using E to jump and your spacebar to command units, i.e.), but once you get the hang of it the controls handle quite nicely. The UI is decent enough, with your units divided into catagories that you then select from (Offensive for things like tanks, Defensive for turrets and howitzers, utility for gatherers and such, ect.). The system is a bit limited but works smoothly enough with the gameplay.All in all I HIGHLY reccomend this game to anyone looking to try something new. Battlezone plays like nothing else out on the market, and while an RTS/FPS hybrid does take some getting used to it is well worth a try. It may have aged a bit and might not look as good as current-gen AAA games, but this is one sleeper that will grab a willing player by the throat and keep them begging for more."

76561197970739339,Recommended,301650,22522833,"Posted: 19 April, 2016",all,Captain Chaos,"My favorite game apart from maybe Interstate '76, and it's based upon that game's engine anyway. One of the defining games of my childhood and well deserving of this re-release.Originally released in 1998, this take on Battlezone was itself a re-imagining of the 1980 arcade game. It blended first-person vehicular combat with real-time strategy elements to create a revolutionary hybrid game experience that has only been briefly revisited since, in games such as Sacrifice and Brutal Legend.In 1952, as the story goes, a meteor shower in the arctic circle brought a previously unknown organic material to Earth. Simultaneously discovered by scientists of both the US and the Soviet Union, this ""Bio-Metal"" was soon discovered to have the unique ability to remember shapes it had previously assumed. From this material, the superpowers created hovering tanks and weapons centuries ahead of anything they could have otherwise made at the time. They quickly ran out of it, and turned their eyes towards the stars in search of more. In secret, the two nations sent thousand-man armies into space. Thus began a new, hidden chapter of the Cold War- the one too brutal to televise. You will journey to the moon, Mars, Venus and beyond in search of the bio-metal, and the truth of its origins.You take the role of a soldier of either the Americans' National Space Defense Force, or NSDF, or the Russians' Cosmo Colonist Army, or CCA. You begin most campaign missions, as well as multiplayer strategy matches, with your own tank and a Recycler- at once your core base structure, your resource depository, and a factory that produces all other essential units. It exists in a mobile or deployed state, able to travel (slowly) about until you find a geyser over which to deploy it, whereupon it becomes able to build. You have two resources: scrap, and pilots. The former are gathered by scavengers, autonomous resource-harvesting vehicles built from the Recycler that will wander the map gathering bio-metal scrap, found lying around in fields on most maps, or generated from destroyed vehicles and structures. Controlling these scrap fields and assigning escorts to your scavengers is crucial in more difficult missions, and in multiplayer.Combat vehicles include nimble scout craft, light and medium tanks, rocket tanks, bombers, and walkers. Defensive units include mobile turrets and artillery that must deploy to fire, as well as minelayers. Offensive vehicles for the most part are fast, turn quickly and can strafe, allowing you to maintain fire on a target while avoiding return fire, though the bombers do not turn quickly and are more adept at long-range strikes on static structures. Combat is fast and chaotic- focused fire can destroy most vehicles in seconds, and battles can involve upwards of twenty tanks at once- more in the campaign. You should quickly master the ability to group your units using Control plus the Function keys, and commanding them to focus-fire individual enemy targets, lest they haphazardly engage multiple enemies at once and lose the advantage of their numbers. The scouts and turrets are built from your Recycler, while the rest are built from your Unit Factory, a more specialized builder vehicle that is also built from the Recycler. If a vehicle is destroyed, including yours, fear not- the pilot will eject, and have the opportunity to return to their base and be put in a new vehicle. While on foot, you are extremely vulnerable, but not defenseless- you have a low-damage plasma gun, as well as a sniper rifle you can use to snipe out the pilot of an enemy vehicle and steal it for yourself. Be wary of enemy pilots in multiplayer!You may also build a Constructor vehicle from your Recycler that can build fixed structures, such as powerful gun towers, repair and resupply structures, and a communications tower that grants you access to an overhead satellite view in the vein of a traditional RTS. It can also build a barracks- the only way to increase your pilot count. Protect your Constructor well- it's often a priority target for AI enemies, and getting a network of gun towers up is crucial for fending off regular enemy raids in the later campaign missions. You will also want to build an Armory, a third mobile base vehicle that builds and launches repair, ammo and weapon pickups, as it is your only means of repairing structures and allows you to resupply in the field, as well as launch bombs on enemy bases.You can command your units either by looking directly at them and pressing the space bar or by selecting them using the number keys from a list. Units are organized into offensive, defensive, utility, with an extra section for available navigation beacons, which also function as cameras when selected, to give you remote viewing of that location. Offensive units have the most diverse range of orders- they can be commanded to move to a specific location, attack or defend your current target, follow you, defend a key friendly, or to move to a selected nav beacon, as well as to get repairs or ammunition, or to recycle- refunding a portion of scrap used in their construction, as well as returning their pilots to your global pilot count- this is good, because you have a finite cap of 30 pilots per level and they cannot be replaced. This works both ways- target enemy pilots to deny the AI access to replacement units- I think. The computer probably cheats on both scrap and pilots, and they most certainly can spawn near-infinite waves of harassing attacks on your base. It works in multiplayer though.Aside from the two story campaigns, there are a variety of multiplayer modes, including deathmatch, strategy, and ""MPI"", a form of co-op strategy versus AI. This Redux includes extensive Steam Workshop support- you can download maps on the fly even in-game. It also includes updated models and visual effects, trading cards, achievements, and other niceties- aside from running very smoothly on modern systems, more so then it ever did in the old days. However, it is a essentially a straight re-release, and does not attempt to address any of the game's existing shortcomings- save the netcode, of course.You are limited, for example, to only ten units of each type, since that's as far as the number keys go, as well as the hard pilot cap of 30. The AI is single-minded at best and suicidal at worst, with frequent issues with pathfinding, often getting stuck trying to scale inclines the player would have no trouble at all with. Scavengers are completely incapable of not only defending themselves but even of reacting to being attacked, and will continue on their merry way scavenging in the face of certain destruction. Artillery units will fire at will regardless of the risk of hitting your own forces and cannot be set to hold their fire. Your offensive units also require careful management ot get the most out of their attacks. The walkers are also so painfully slow that their use in most campaign missions is extremely limited- its entirely possible to finish CCA Mission 6, for example, without the use of the three Golems you are given. Most campaign missions also have only one or two safe methods of completion, with very little room for experimental tactics.However, most of these flaws are attributable to the limitations of the original game engine, and and while they are even more glaringly obvious all these years later, there is something to be said for bringing the game to Steam and a new audience as is, the way we enjoyed it 18 years ago, and it is certainly easier to forgive then a brand new game with these same flaws. Battlezone was something completely new and any problems it had were excusable in the face of how much fun I had with it, and it was a great pleasure to revisit this landmark title in both my young life and the history of PC gaming. I urge newcomers and old hands, shooter and strategy fans alike to pick this one up. You will not be disappointed."

If you like RTS games, and like what you see it is worth it. The way the game feels even today is smooth and just like I recall from nearly two decades ago, whereas normally nostalgia games don't live up to their memory this one most certainly does indeed.

This is one of the greatest video games ever made and possibly the best tank real time strategy game ever made. It is legendary. Now onto the review of this Redux remake:First thing, I appreciate that they kept the opening theme of the game, that was a nice touch. The rest unfortunately needs work. This does not look much better than the orignal game with the HiRes texture pack installed. I was expecting the graphincs to be much more polished but I was dissapointed. The vehicles (Tanks, turrets, etc.) have been improved only slightly, they are still blocky/geometrical. I was dissapointed with the sounds (Gunshots, explosions) as well, they are the original ones and sound exactly the same. The explosion graphics look the same as the originals with the HiRes pack installed. A few more things worth mentioning: When you first open the game the small launch screen looks like the work of a 2 year old, very crude. The fonts of the in-game menus do not look good. Also, the original game has a built-in cheat code to enable access to all the maps. You would choose your side (Either US or CCA) and then type:  iamadirtycheater and the map list would appear. It doesn't work on this remake. Since it was part of the original game, it should have been included.I would not recommend this remake. Stick to the orignal w/ HiRes texture pack installed. Works and looks flawless, even on a modern system."

Does that mix do the job? Yes and no. What is certainly lacking is apause-and-commandbutton, minding the FPS element is often intense, leaving very little time to make grand strategic decisions. But whether playingCommand and Conqueryou have ever thought if it was you in one of those tanks, you'd show'em, here you go,Battlezoneis all about that and it is tough as nails.The game is a true classic, reminding me ofUFO Enemy Unknown[1993] in many aspects.BattlezoneandUFOare both innovative, experimenting and focused on multilayer management. Both also represent core science-fiction. WhileUFOis yet turn-based and general level,Battlezoneis real-time and down to the gunbattle.Battlezoneis definitely a gem of its time, probably even beyond its time, probably even beyond any time before or after its release, so to say. It is just a unique product. How does it stand nowadays? How playable it ultimately is at the present?That is when things come down to the rating, which unfortunately is negative. STEAM review must be either recommending or dissuading. With greatest difficulty I see this game appealing to modern [2016] players. The problem is more than just nature of visuals or lacking of certain ease elements, such as the mentionedpause-and-commandfunction. It is the oftentimes chaotic picture of action, difficulty of FPS combat and movement controls, overall difficulty level, complex real-time base and force management with flaws characteristic to the early productions standing for the RTS genre.The score is 5/10 wHATs grade. I should best repeat what has already been put in one of the other customers reviews: if you are prone to like this game, you probably already know it, thus have little need for any reviews to help you make up your mind about the purchase. Otherwise, if you hesitate, skip it.What is needed withBattlezone, is a complete remake [reboot], reintroducing the game to the modern public, instead of only a visual facelift [redux].

I feel like the game balance is wrong because the bomber and tank units died faster than the scout. I was also very frustrated when bombs and rockets seemed to do less DPS than my scout's mini gun. The rockets were especially frustrating because they fly very slowly, forcing you to lead the target a considerable amount.I could have dealt with all that if the joystick aiming was more intuitive. Most games use joystick as acceleration/force for looking and aiming, this game it's an absolute value. If you aim the stick 10% up, the guy looks exactly 10% up.

I always loved that you can jump out of you vehicle & snipe the enemy out of their's & take their vehicle if you want to or if your vehicle get blown up & the enemy don't know your their enemy until you start shooting them unless they saw you do it. You take control of your team but they do stuff by them self well enough it's pretty much set & forget with them, tell your units to defend something & they do tell them to move some where they will. there are very few things I'd change about this game, well worth the money you spend on it. One down side is they haven't yet rereleased the sequel Battlezone 2 yet. 8 out of 10 (always room for improvement =) )"

Gives the original the botox treatment it needed, but not too much eye-popping. (Depending on much you've played the original.)-HUD: finally scales with screen resolution, though purists might argue that it's not 100% the same.-Modding support: Steam Workshop integration, yay!-Multiplayer supportWhat hasn't:-Gameplay: if your think that the redux will change any bigger gameplay elements, you will be in for a dissappointment.-Sounds: Again, no major, noticeable changes. Music is the same, unit voices are the same. (""Die, you commie pinkoes!"" FTW)Note: it doesn't include the Red Odyssey expansion.Overall: a must-buy if you're a fan of the original, a possible should-buy if you want interested in how an arcade tank shooter - real-time strategy mix would work, or want some retro-futuristic space Cold War butt-kicking."

Don't make that mistake coming into this game.The game's difficulty is pretty steep on some places forcing you to think about what you need and plan out a good defense and offence. Unlike most RTS ideals where rushing into battle before the AI get's its camp set, you're rewarded for planning out your base and making the right choices for your army.The storyline for the game is also really interesting. Each mission opens the storyline up a bit more, not giving you worthless side quests that have no effect on the story.Now, there are some issues, but you'll have that when dealing with older titles. The Devs have so far been pretty good about hearing everyone out and fixing what they can.I'd highly recommend this game not just cause the game itself is fun and challenging, but the odds of getting BattleZone 2 being remade the same way is better if you do. To me, BZ2 is the better of the two but this game still has its place on top.Hopefully this game gets popular again so that other Devs try their hand at FPS\RTS games, because it's a genre that doesn't get enough love."

The game was years ahead of its time. Unfortunately they don't make games like this nowadays. It's a pity since with todays technology and graphics, this would be an instant hit.The campaign(s) are well written and fully voiced. You play a commander of either the US or Soviet forces in a war for resources in our solar system, mostly on the various moons of our planets. But it is not just your standard conflict of US vs Soviet, there will be a surprise in the campaign...nuff said. :)The UI is innovative and context sensitive, which is also absolutely a must for a tactical and strategic game like this, given the orders you have to provide on the fly. Even after so many years developers still can't get UI right and given the complexity of BattleZone, it is a refreshing surprise that a 18 year old game nails it spot on.If you think that the price is too high for such an old game, let me tell you it is totally worth it. This overhaul comes with completly new models of vehicles, buidlings, surfaces and sky-boxes. It is not just a fake ""HD overhaul"".

The genre never really took off, but because Battlezone was bundled with a lot of graphics cards it reached a wide audience and gained a cult following.If you are someone who's considering buying this having played it way back when, do it. It's a reworking, not a remake, so the real BZ atmosphere is still there. The ships and buildings are all heavily redone, with much more detailed models and much larger textures. They look excellent. The terrain looks very much like it did back in the original, so it's still behind Battlezone 2, nevermind more modern titles. But all things considered, the graphics do a good job today with the update. The gameplay is as rich as ever. Multiplayer is now handled through Steam within the game, which keeps things nice and simple, with all the old options. A bomber DM is still a thrill after all these years.If you are someone who's never played the original and are wondering whether you should buy this, well don't expect it to look fresh. The developers of this update have done an incredible job hauling parts of the game into the 2010s, but there are engine limitations. Firefights are limited to a few hundred meters in distance, and don't expect detailed ballistics or other physics.The real joy of Battlezone, however, was always its gameplay, and its blend of FPS and RTS that has never really been replicated since. In each mission you will be dogfighting and base building, often at the same time. A selection of ships can be built, each of which offer different benefits, and you can kit them out with a variety of weapons. Your resources (""biometal"") are gathered by Scavengers which have an annoying habit of wandering off into dangerous areas and so need to be constantly protected. Two single-player campaigns are included, so there's a hefty chunk of content for someone who has no plans to dabble in multiplayer.At the price, this game still delivers eighteen years after its original release, whether you're looking for something new or a satisfying hit of nostalgia.

Which is good, as they (mostly) still hold up 19 years later. Zipping around in your tank of choice still feels good, as if the vehicles have weight to them. Weapons still have a punch. Commanding multiple units is still easy enough to figure out from the start, though doesn't get much more in-depth than what you get at the surface.As for the remake, almost all of the changes have been cosmetic. Upgraded textures, visual effects, some touches to lighting. A proper, full-on remake could have seen multiple Quality of Life changes, or changes to things like the shape of terrain, additional units/buildings, or changes to the way pilot movement and combat functions. I just wish Big Boat Interactive had donemore.As it stands, it seems as though this project was given to a small team to test waters, and the new Battlezone VR game appears to have been the focus of Rebellion's use of the IP. The game is still fun, and I'm eager to see what else they have in store for the series."

I was half expecting to be disappointed with this, thinking that a lot of what I remember would be nostalgia rather than a quality game but I'm finding it every bit as good as I remember.  The depth of control and flexibility is still good and the game plays smoothly even as a ""mobile"" experience."

No other game ever came close to combining a first person shooter, inside a real time strat with online play.  The flight mechanics were always fantastic, and you'd have fun just flying arounf the moon and doing sideway slides, but combined with such a clever and intuitive user interface Battlezone really hit all of the marks. The only thing that was ever wrong with Battlezone, was that because it was an unusual mix - most people never even tried it.So this is what it is.Imagine a strat game - in the style of things like command and conquer, or something where you're building resources and one or more enemies is as well. Now imagine that instead of being a god like figure looking down on that game, you're actually inside it. You can run around, jump into vehicles, eject and so on - but more importantnly you can still command an array of ships and resources as the battle rages around you - almost as simply as pointing at something.The AI of your ships and enemy ships is great and large battles can unfold - but then take that online - and suddenly you have a dozen people all doing this in a strat game, or simply battling it our like a roman gladiator.In the last 20 years this game is still unsurpassed in the in game user interface, flight mechanics, first person strat - and potential for online fun"
