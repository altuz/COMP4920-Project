,Recommended,301700,10225818,"Posted: 24 May, 2014",all,MashPotato,"Numba Deluxe is a casual puzzle game in which you highlight groups of number by type (eg. 1 1 1 1), order (1 2 3 4), addition (1 3 5 7) or multiplication (1 2 4 8), causing them to disappear and numbers from above to fall. There are three modes: Classic, Timeless, and Puzzle. I bought this for the puzzle mode, in which I've spent about 95% of my playing time, so that's what I'm reviewing.This is very much a game of what you see is what you get: watch the video on the store page and you'll know whether this is your type of game or not. That might be kind of lazy of me to say in a review, but it's true ;)  Visuals are clean but unspectacular, music is cheery but non-descript--there are no bells and whistles here. The same background is used throughout all the menus/games, the same sound effect is used every.single.time. you clear blocks (and you will hear it a LOT).That said, is the gameplay itself solid? I would say so. The puzzles, in which you must clear all the blocks from the level, are generally on the easy side so far (I'm at level 60-something out of 84, in about 1.5 hours), but once in a while there's some curveballs thrown your way via different block types to keep it varied. (eg. a fire block needs to fall on an ice block to melt it).However, so far it's a good thing that levels are easy, because the puzzles appear sequentially, and there's no way to skip to a different puzzle without solving the one you're on.  The scoring system seems rather pointless as well, as every time you restart the game you begin at 0, and there's no score recorded for individual puzzles, so the highscore table is really just a matter of how long you played rather than how well/fast you solved the puzzles (there's also no timer, btw).On a technical note, there are no resolution options.I realize I'm sounding rather negative, but that's only because I'm mentioning things that are small annoyances.  The positives are all in the video: it's a simple, straightforward game that can be easily picked up and sometimes makes you put on your thinking cap. I have no regrets about my $3."

Solid art and sound presentation. Enough variety to keep it interesting. Modes for both hardcore and casual players. With a $3 price tag, this is a great buy for all puzzle enthusiasts."

The game's resolution is 800x600 I believe so it looks pretty darn ugly on a large monitor. And every time you play and quit your game you have to restart from the beginning, not to mention the annoying sound effect that keeps repeating itself. If it is fine by you guys, I'll stick to Bejeweled 3....."

There are 3 different types of gamemodes:1. Classic2. Timeless3. PuzzleSome levels are pretty challenging, but you can relax during playing this game.It's not really expensive.. 3€ are worth for this good game. Especially when you can get a coupon when you craft a badge!Then it's really worth it. I just have to recommend this game.. There are alot of logic games.. But this one is one of the best."

76561198137201199,Recommended,301700,18394256,"Posted: 9 October, 2015",all,stephekank,This is more of a game you would play while you are bored and don't have a lot of time. The puzzle option is fun. The classic is similar to bejeweled only using numbers rather than colors and jewels. There should be a nuetral option for games like this.

Best played in shorter sessions as it gets tedious fast. Although the game is nice there are some things that need adjusting and/or adding. In the end there are ton of flash games out there with a similar theme, for free. If you end up wanting it anyway I recommend finding it on a sale for an interesting way to kill time.------------------------------------------------------------------If you liked this review you can find more on theCurator pageor in myReview Corner."

The hypnotic music in the background with sound effects brings to mind Vegas slot machines, which combine to keep you playing."

However, the gameplay gets dull and repetitive very quickly. I caught this on a discount ($0.44). So, I'm not out much. But this is one I'll be uninstalling."

I just like match three and puzzle games and this one, playing with numbers, is just what the doctor orderd. So if you're looking for something different, you should try Numba Delux. Well worth the money for this one."

This game is a nice puzzler for those who just want to chill and take a break from all the fast paced madness around. It's strangely addictive as well. ha!"
,Recommended,301700,13717610,"Posted: 30 December, 2014",all,Sweets,"Five Minutes.I literally played five minutes of this game. It's really not what I thought it would be. The design overall is nice and the use of numbers instead of candy or gems is a really neat idea, but I think there's so much more you can do with this. I may give it another go someday, but for now? It's just pretty boring. If I wanted this I woulda just bought Bejewled.This being said I do recommend it, because it has awesome potential to be a fun number game."
,Recommended,301700,16902732,"Posted: 5 July, 2015",all,Mirianda,"I will put recommend, with a few caveats....The gameplay itself is quite interesting and worth the puzzle aspect.  It gets a bit frustrating when you can see what you need to do without being able to quite see what you need to do.  I'll admit, I've played more on the challenges than the regular gameplay, but there are interesting aspects to completely clearing the board.  It's a different take on a fairly old concept, but fun.  I'd recommend picking it up on sale...."
