,Not Recommended,301730,10495830,"Posted: 16 June, 2014",all,EmP,300 Dwarves is a pretty basic tower defence game. With only twelve levels to play and five towers to choose from. Plus a 700% price hike from the original iOS build justified by exactly nothing at all.Full Review //http://www.honestgamers.com/12299/pc/300-dwarves/review.html

It is true that it resembles Kingdom Rush, but then again it also resembles the 8Floor games (Royal Defense, Fort Defense, etc.) and loads of other TDs.I like the graphics and sounds, and basically the game play is ok. But... and it is a BIG but, there is not much strategy in this game. At first I found it incredibly hard, since it didn't seem I could earn money fast enough to build my defenses. The I realised that there was a simple tower strategy, you could apply. That strategy worked for every level in the game except the last. I'm sorry but where is the challenge and fun in that??? If I don't count the hours I spend finding that strategy, I think I finished in 2 hours.It seems like this game is not very well thought through, and altho it is cute there are much better TDs out there."

It was too easy for me also... Yes, I didn't get ""perfect"" on every map, but I got close enough that this didn't matter to my experience."

Its definitely a mobile port and should be priced near its mobile counterparts.There is one main strategy.. once you figure it out it makes the game extremely easy. I beat the game in around 1.5 hours, so that made this as much as going to a movie, however I feel any movie I would haver seen would have been more memorable.On the plus side the art is pretty nice."

You can only unlock about half which is very frustrating.  It left me feeling like they only compled building half a game.  Hopefully they will add more levels in a future upgrade.  Maybe if this was a free brower game this would be acctable but when you purchase a game you expect to be able to unlock all the upgrades.

It's pretty basic really. You will find it difficult at first but once it's dawned on you what you need to do to stop the select number of enemy waves from getting to the exit point, then you can play that strategy for all the levels except the last one. There is a handful of levels 10 or 12 from memory with an additional 2 which gets unlocked when you have finished the game. The last level is without a doubt the hardest. I have 3 gold on every level other than the last one and just cant seem to master the last level for a 3 gold status no matter how i work my combinational defense. The game will take you 3 - 5 hrs at the maximum. If you ever do get it and get three gold on  the last level please inform me how you managed to do it. I would be extremely interested. Novel way to spend a night."

When you didn't play Kingdom Rush - try it first. If you played it and liked it - i guess you will like 300 dwarves too."

It's not great, but you could play it while listening to something in the background. If I could, I would give this a neutral review, I have gone with the thumbs down since I have given negative reviews to more ambitious yet flawed games. It's easier not to be flawed when there's not a whole lot going on.300 Dwarves gets the fundamentals right but doesn't go beyond them. If you see it on sale and know what you're getting into, it's not a terrible game to get your fix. It's just rote tower defense that takes about 3 hours to beat."

I won't give anything away but I only used 1 type of tower for the first few missions, then added a second type of tower to fix the unballance from the first.  The other towers have been useless to me.  :(  Note: Make sure to upgrade your towers with your gold bars as you unlock them after each mission."

,Recommended,301730,15409344,"Posted: 16 April, 2015",all,Nellodee,"While this isn't a bad game, it is uninspired. But it's nice looking enough and easy to play, so I feel like it deserves a thumbs up despite not being particularly exciting. If you're super into the genre and have exhausted the best Steam has to offer (Kingdom Rush, Defender's Quest, and Royal Defense are the first titles that come to mind), then it's worth picking up on sale."

Cute small sprites. Sound effects are alright. Music repetitive. Voice acting and visual novel style character portraits that dont look half bad. Reminded me vaguely of Disciples II dwarvesCons:Only twelve levels, by level 8 or 9 some foes will start being outright immune to certain towers making planning ahead difficult and progression frustrating and putting into question the worth of keeping this title in library.Conclusion: Kinda liked playing that one for an evening until the final few levels. Story is rather superficial, as is the rest. I am kind of disapointed that this is all there is to this game. I thought the tower types were fitting thematically. Not a lot of diversity in how you can upgrade, not a lot of tooltips or info on foes. Would had liked keeping this game around if it had more fleshed out mechanics and more content but given the circumstances it is too small ambitions a game that belongs on the mobile market or on a flash website."

It just gets repetative.  There are way better town defence games out there, this one just feels like it the dev didn't just pushed it out, and didn't really put any love into it."
,Not Recommended,301730,16879889,"Posted: 4 July, 2015",all,(-TN-) EvilGenius,"A tower defense game, that is a poor copy of Kingdom Rush 1 and 2. Without using a decent game engine they are stuck with poor scaling of sprites and a fixed resoultion. Game play is standard tower defense with no effor given to building of the deffences. If you like tower deffense games and are willing to look past the graphics and the little problems with the game I would pick this up. I am not willing to look past the faults. This is a no for me."

Lack of strategy, lack of weapon development, lack of gameplay feedback, glitchy sound, one strategy beats the game, etc. And It is very short. Good to spend an hour if you bought it on sale. With good discount. I had 60% off, but wish it was 80%."
