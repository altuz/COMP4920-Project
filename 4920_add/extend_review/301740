,Not Recommended,301740,13611564,"Posted: 26 December, 2014",all,Mr.BloodyLucky,"Having clicked 'No', I will add the proviso that I WOULD recommend 'Castle: Never Judge a Book by its Cover', but ONLY to fans of the 'Castle' TV series! Anyone else should probably avoid.Whilst I enjoyed the game, that was primarily because, as a fan, I recognised the in-jokes to some of the episodes of the series and the faithfully recreated scenes from the sets of the show.The gameplay itself is a bit lacklustre. Most of the game is spent playing the missing objects mechanic whereby you pick out a small list of items from a large screen full of stuff. A bit 'Where's Waldo', but fine, although this does get tedious rather fast. Of more promise are the many little logic puzzle games which are many and varied - most are familiar and simple, but some are a bit more challanging. The only downside to these logic puzzles is that the 'Hint' mechanic allows you to completely skip the games, thus rendering them utterly pointless.And here we get to the big drawback to this game: the 'Hint' mechanic. In most games where hints are given, usually you get actual 'hints' to what to do, but leaving you to continue to work things out. In 'C:NJaNbiC' the 'Hint' machinic leads you around by the hand. Not sure what you should be doing? 'Hint' Go here, do this. Can't solve this puzzle mini-game? 'Hint' Solved. Really, the button should be labelled 'Bored Now' or 'Too Lazy'.I bought the game with the understanding that there would be no animations, just still scenes, but I was disappointed that there was NO actual voice-acting at all. The entire game takes place in virtual silence, with some barely adequate, low-key synth music to fill the void of all the text boxes as the characters 'talk'. This is a real shame since the game is based on the 'Castle' TV show which has characters with distinct and charming voices, so why not get them doing some voice acting for the game? And the synth music is hardly inkeeping with the music used throughout the TV series, which is chock full of funky current music tracks. I guess the licensing costs too much?As already mentioned, there were no animations, it was all character portraits and still scene imagery, but the game would certainly have benefited from animated characters and backdrops. But hey, costs, what can you do?And finally, lets mention length. It's short. I played it through in 4 hours, and that was by doing ALL the puzzles. If I skipped through all the ones I had trouble with, that time would probably have been halved. Considering that the game is made without animation or sound content, could they perhaps not have made futher episodic iterations with new games or mechanics to it? Shame, as that might have made it worth the money, to have further stories to work through, like actually playing a season of 'Castle', with themes continued in subsequent episodes. That would at least have given the game a lift in it's simplistic and obvious storytelling.Which leads me to what is probably the biggest issue I had with the game: the story. Without spoiling it, I will say that it was obivous from very early on what the situation was and who the killer was - Ok, so that reguarly occurs in episodes of the show where you can guess who-dunnit, but the story doesn't do anything clever with it, and comes to a boring and obvious conclusion. For a game based on a TV series with pretty decent storylines, and featuring a professional Author, it commits the ultimate sin of 'poor story telling', and that's the final nail in the coffin.To summarise: the game has some fun little puzzles and recognisable scenes/characters from the TV series, but lack of good sound, animation and poor storytelling make it very bland, and the short, limited story is too brief, with no hope of any kind of replayability. For a casual game, it's... Okay. Ish. For a point & click game, it's... Poor.One to avoid."

I was blown away by the characters and the story plot. It was such a twist! Really enjoyed it! Better than i expect it! Music may repeat itself from time to time entering a new cast but you can overcome that, So far best crime solving game ever! #CaskettAlways"
,Recommended,301740,20915018,"Posted: 2 February, 2016",all,Vic=HKC=,"I'm a fan of Castle and the dynamic between Beckett and Castle. So, when I saw the game on Steam, I've bought it. I've done two playthroughs: one in 2014 and another one yesterday, just because I needed to refresh my memory for finally writing a review about the game.There is a serial killer that is recreating scenes from classic books. Castle and Beckett are on the case, along with Esposito, Ryan and Lanie while Gates is supervising everyone while Alexis and Martha are kinda behind... As you understand, this game is set during season 4, after Montgomery's death but before... well, as they're canon, the Caskett moment, the kiss at the end. Besides, it's the world of the edition that is targeted, hence the title Never Judge a Book by its Cover.While the story could be converted into an episode, the gameplay is the standard one: list of items and puzzles. And while the hidden scenes are easy, the puzzles are really a brain wrecker. They're hard, except for a few. I must admit that it's one of the most difficult games that I had to play and where I skipped a lot.Despite that, everything from the show is respected: the whiteboard with suspects, victims and clues, Castle's books or pictures, even some other references are in the hidden object scenes: the laser tag game, the writer's vest, the 3XK reference, the coffee.... And while the graphics are classic, they're respectful of the actors: you recognize easily the characters, it's always nice to see a well-represented Stana Katic as she's portraying my favorite character. My only little downside is the French translation. Indeed, you for us can be the you familiar (tu) or the formal you (vous). Castle and Beckett never used the you familiar in the French translation in the show, so, I was kinda expecting ""vous"" but I've seen some ""tu"" slipped. Besides, I agree that it would have been more logical to have a ""tu"" as Castle and Beckett considers themselves as best friends at this point but I don't know why officially, they've sticked to ""vous"".Anyway, enough with my whining about language, I'm just sad that the original soundtrack from Castle isn't there. But well, the one in the game is still enjoyable.Is Castle: Never Judge a Book by its Cover worthy? If you're a fan of the show, yes. If you're an hardcore gamer for casual gaming, yes. If you're a newbie, check Artifex Mundi's titles, they're easier in terms of puzzles, because Castle will probably give you a cold shower. At this price, it's perhaps a little too much."
76561198122163777,Recommended,301740,23275096,"Posted: 29 May, 2016",all,Opal Knight,"I'm a fan of both Hidden Objects Games and the Castle TV series and after playing through this game a couple of times I would recommend it to fans of either category.As a game based off of the Castle series, the artist's renditions of the cast are spot on, as well as some of the familiar locales used such as Castle's loft.  There is no voice acting of any sort, which is a bit of a disappointment, and would have made this a ""must have"" title.  However, I understand that getting the actual actors to read their parts would have been far too expensive for a game of this genre, and at least they didn't try to get impersonators to read for the characters, which would have been worse.  The writing isn't terrible, and it is easy to read the lines with the inflections and personality of the show's characters so that the whole game plays out like an episode of the series.Even if you are not a fan of the HOG genre but still a fan of the show, this game is worth picking up.  The HOG style lends itself well to the investigatory story style of Castle and as the Hidden Object category is a casual genre, you don't have to be good at any particular gaming skill to be able to fully enjoy this title.As far as a Hidden Object Game goes, it's a pretty decent title to play through.  If you are not a fan of the series, the characters really aren't introduced all that well, and the nuances of the characters' personalities wont come through, but those are more added flavor for the game rather than something which would impede understanding of the story as it progresses.  The artwork is crisp and beautifully drawn and detailed making the actual hidden object scenes a pleasure to complete.  The stand alone puzzles are nicely varied, challenge-wise, between hard and easy.  There are a few real brainteasers in there which is a refreshing change from most of the elementary-only challenges that many HOGs offer.  However, the item pickup and placement puzzles are where this game really falls short.As mentioned above the hidden object puzzles are well done in this game.  Not only are the pictures easy to see and objects easy to identify what they are ment to be, but there is also the added option of choosing to swap between a word list and a shadow outline of the hidden objects.  I especially like this option, because if it becomes difficult to locate a particular item it gives me the opportunity to get a clue as to what the game wants me to look for before having to resort to the ""hint"" button which just gives the answer outright.  There are also a few interactive items on each list where you have to figure out little mini-puzzles to get the correct item to show (which are a fun way to make the hidden object scene not just a clickfest for those who can't be bothered to actually find the objects in the scenes).The stand alone puzzles are well done also.  Each puzzle has an information tab which clearly describes what needs to be done with the puzzle, as well as a reset tab to start the puzzle over from scratch.  And, if a puzzle just gets too complicated or frustrating, there is always the skip button to bypass the puzzle all together.  As I stated before, this title offers a nice range of difficulty in its puzzles and actually had a few of the hardest puzzles I've come across in this genre.  I found it refreshing that the puzzles are more geared towards adults than the over-simplified puzzles (like matching shapes or colors into their correct locales) that so many of the games in this genre seem to offer.And then there are the item puzzles . . .This is the one area where the game really doesn't hold up well.  The item gathering and usage is simply a random mess and, as many simplistic items (like Q-tips and umbrellas) are stolen right from crime scenes, really detract from the story.  It almost would have been better to drop the item-gathering-and-usage style of this genre and just tell a story inbetween the other puzzles than try and make sense of the items you do get and use in the game.  There is far to much pilfering items from one crime scene to tamper with another back and forth travelling in this game.  No one would travel three seperate times to a crime scene at one end of town just to get some mundane piece of tape or basic tool to then drag back to the other side of town and immediately dump off for one double-A battery or another mundane office supply.  It really felt thrown together and was not thought out at all.  Too bad, because this title could really have been a truly spectacular entry otherwise.All in all I would give this title a B- or perhapse a C+ for a grade.  It does have it's shortcomings, but it also has some pretty well executed features as well.  This would definitely be a game to purchase when it's on sale."

76561197971341065,Recommended,301740,17812567,"Posted: 31 August, 2015",all,sfnhltb,"This is a perfectly decent HOG, with a mix of mostly okay puzzles to spice things up. There are no bugs or issues I found, the hint system works correctly (as opposed to a couple of similar games I have played recently that just shuffles you forward and backward between two adjacent rooms in a few places leaving you to work it out or find a walkthrough), and the HOG scenes are reasonably naturalistic (no over-hiding of objects in unrealistic positions, or too many anachronistic/out of place items for the location). The storyline is fine and keeps things moving, but nothing too special (note I haven't got around to watching any of the TV series the game is based on, so I didn't get much benefit from the characters interactions, YMMV if you are a fan).For me the biggest weakness of the game is the point and click sections in between the rest of the game - while it all works fine and is easy enough to play and you have the hint system if you get stuck on what to do next, most of the tasks you have to do are complete nonsense, illogical and immersion breaking - you will spend a lot of time solving puzzles and searching crime scenes not for clues, but for screwdrivers, fuses, batteries, hammers, oars (to form part of a jury-rigged ladder!), and most bizarrely there is an entire section where you solve puzzles, dig up plant beds and drain a washing machine in order to find $2 to buy a soda to cool down a BBQ to get a pair of tongs.In a setting where you are trapped in a murderer's house, or in a tiny village miles from nowhere, or whatever, these sorts of scavenging tasks wouldn't feel out of place as you don't have any choice, but in a scenario where you are in the middle of a city and can travel about at will it make no sense that you spend 75%+ of the time while trying to track down an active murderer rummaging about for things you could buy from the local convenience store, or by having a toolbox in the back of your car. Joint worst for this goes to using a cotton swab found lying around at a previous crime scene in the crime lab (well no risk of contamination of the sample there!), and pulling the lever off the wall in the church which you later use to operate heavy machinery at a construction site.If you can look past this though, the game plays well enough, so I would still recommend it if you like the HOG style of game, you just have to try to gloss over the why of most of what you are doing and go with it."

The games sat there for a few months until I got in an adventure game mood and played all of them in a week.Oddly, my 'adventure game mood' means I don't feel like paying constant attention. If you really can't concentrate, Sinister Stories are generally great with their hints, maps letting you know where to go, and letting you skip puzzles you simply can not be bothered with. Perfect for my need to be distracted but catering to my bouts of mental laziness.  (if you are a hard core adventurist, never fear, you can set the games to difficult)Anyway, Castle was part of the bundle and was the only one related to a TV show.  Almost from the very beginning of the game I started saying ""What?!"" and ended up constantly swearing at the absurdity.The game plays fine, but what you have to do and collect is ridiculous as part of a Castle storyline. It isn't a matter of suspending disbeliefe, it is a matter of completely disconnecting.:Possible Spoilers:  For instance, you get a long plank of wood out of a locker in a church basement so you can take it to a *huge construction site* across town, to cross a gap.  You are a fabulously wealthy writer who has go through hoops to pick up loose change in one part of the city, to buy a soda in another part of the city, to pour on a bar-b-q in yet another part of the city.  It's all like that. That's all well and good if you are trapped in a gigantic mansion and brought nothing with you.  It is a bunch of ""no"" when you have a hefty bank account, freedom to move around a city and a police department backing you up.  I was constantly thinking 'he should just go to the store or have the police bring him this junk'.  Then for extra eye-rolling, Castle has to do all the forensic tests.  I am assuming the case against the murderer is eventually dismissed because the police let a writer test for DNA and run fingerprints.  If this was an episode of Castle, the writers would tested for substance abuse and fired.If you like adventure games and don't care at all about its premise, it has all the adventure elements you'd expect.  Otherwise it's unbelievable twaddle -- quickly cobbled together to grab merchandising money.  Unless you get the Sinister Stories Bundle, I recommend giving this game a wide miss."

(i.e. Yes, with caveats)Playing this game with no awareness previously that there even was a TV show called Castle probably meant that I missed a lot of the inside jokes/character interplay.  On the other hand, the game was constantly offering to skip dialogue so maybe the game designers didn't consider it to be of high value either.In general, this is a Hidden Objects game.  It's dead center in the middle of the genre, playing a lot like a PC Adventure game but with a lot more backtracking and one shot objects to solve specific situations.  It was OK as a Hidden Object game.  (Lots of chaotic jumbled scenes, very few AHA! moments when I suddenly recognized new patterns.)  The puzzles were either fairly simple/straightforward, or extremely tedius where a monkey could solve them, given sufficient persistance and ability to randomly click.  Luckily there was the SKIP/Hint feature in the tedious cases.The overall plot was very interesting; but the game had some specific irritant gotchas (for me at least), such as allowing us to use a potentially contaminated Q-tip swap from a crime scene as part of DNA lap work for a different piece of evidence.  There were several instances where it felt like they were trying to play with the lab equipment, but it didn't really add to the overall plot.  (Possibly a reference from the TV show I'm unaware of.)  I really enjoyed the Literatured Themed Murders (Hard Back Killer), but very quickly all the details blurred together and I didn't see how the selected quotes, etc. really added much.  (As demonstrated when they summarized them out of existence on the Evidence board.)Final Score:  3/5 Stars.I would definitely recommend other Hidden Object games ahead of this one.  It felt like this was a product bundle with a known franchise with an OK game.  Don't buy this one for $10.P.S.

Castle, unfortantly falls short in almost every way.First off there is no voice acting from the cast of the show, no voice acting at all in fact.  The story is told through text conversations and the writting lacks any of the humor or charm of the show.  You could replace the characters with any other tv crime drama (or just random cops) and it would be pretty much the same game.  The only thing that comes off as a castle story is the Overly Bizzare case your trying to solve.The art is alright.  Characters are reconizable and everything looks nice enough. It gets the job done but nothing about the art stands out or pops like some of the better hidden object games out there.The Item fetching is where i really get annoyed.  I'm okay with having to track down a tool to get some item in an adventure game so long as its remotely plausable, but your part of a police inestigative team in this game.  Don't tell me i Have to find the two halves of some sun seal to use on locked chest so i can get a screwdriver to unscrew a computer panel.  Are you telling me the Police don't have a screw driver?  This kind of logic works in a more fantastic setting but not in a contemporary crime drama setting and it just comes off as halariously dumb.The puzzles are also annoying as sin.  They feel shoe horned in and are themeatically out of place. Most are frustrating varients of the game Black Out (hit buttons until everything is lit up or facing the same way or removed)  I usally enjoy the puzzles in Hidden Object games but i found myself skipping most of these.The hidden object puzzles are handled a little better.  Usally they pop up at a trashed crime scene or Castles apperently messy office.  They fucntion alright but finding some of the objects can be an eye strain.If they'd gotten Fillian and some of the other cast to do voice work and had a better script and better puzzles this could have been a great Castle game but as it stands its just a cheaply thrown together cash grab.  Skip It."

Never Judge a Book by Its Cover is somewhere between the two.As a crime story, it is exceptionally well-written with good pacing, good setup, and it knows when to stop before it gets ridiculously overcomplicated. But why is it sold as a Castle game, I have no idea. It has no voice acting, theme song, or anything really related to the show.As a game it is a mediocre hidden object puzzle title with gorgeous, yet overcrowded scenes, and long and frustrating puzzles. But it’s the point ‘n’ click part that kills it: adventure game logic takes over every last shred of realism, which stands in stark contrast of what is seen in the original show.Still, if you like hidden object games, or just want something related to the Castle series and already read all the books, this one may be a nice afternoon pastime."

The graphics are a bit simplified, but clear and good.  The Hidden Object Game (HOG) puzzles are nicely done, and I can't complain about the voice-acting since there IS no voice-acting (but, that's OK).  At the game level, most of my complaints center around the non-HOG puzzles.  Several of them are ridiculously complex, and one of them (the File Folder puzzle) wouldn't accept my perfectly good solution.  My real complaint with the game lies with the ""mystery"" aspect.  Basically, the mystery is ridiculous.  By the second ""incident,"" I had a darn good idea who the penultimate target was.  When the red herring swam by, I saw it immediately and knew whodunnit.  So, I spent most of the game rolling my eyes and groaning at how stupid it was.  Still, I got 5.2 hours of acceptable gameplay out of it and its current list price is less than $4 (and I bought it in a bundle for about a dollar).  So, I'm grudgingly giving it a Recommended rating."

I do appriciate the point and click HOG clicker that is a pen, I thought that was cute. And I love how each charcter makes jokes and sounds like their show-counterpart. But the game is a little dull and I still haven't finished it because even though I love the characters, it's a little bit boring and not the best HOG I've encountered.

It would be more enjoyable for people who are fans of castle. However for fans of HOG and those who like a tinge of mystery with them I would also claim that they may enjoy it even if they do not know the characters.Like most HOG it is short, I beat it in relatively three hours time. Some of the puzzles I will admit need more instruction or confusing but there are no penalties for skipping puzzles you can't understand (The game has no achievements so you don't have to worry about losing an achievement because you can't solve the puzzle) and the hint counter is steady and while some objects aren't decernable in some areas (a backpack being hidden behind a few objects) there is no fear for hitting a hint and going WTF that is NOT what that is as I have seen on some games.The only major complaint I have is the amount of running around you have to do. I had to get wires from three different scenes to unlock a puzzle at a location where no wires were found to begin with.I recommend it. TO those who aren't a fan of Castle I will say that I think it is at least a decent HOG for those who are fans of HOG's to give a shot."

Compared to other HOGs I've played, this one really leads you by the nose. What I find really bizarre is that the main characters have no problem doing a little breaking-and-entering, burglary, and disturbing of crime scenes. It would have been nice if I could have participated in making deductions based on the clues, but that is all handed to you.The HOGs themselves are decent. The other puzzles range from easy to mind-numbingly difficult. The infamous arrow puzzle is one example. Even though I was able to figure out there are seven forced moves, I could not find any logical way to solve it. An organized, methodical brute force method would take several hours. Unless you enjoy this sort of thing, you'll want to refer to a walkthrough for this poser, at least for the first few moves.I hit a bug in the folder sorting puzzle where one folder disappeared and I had to exit and reenter the puzzle to make it show up again. The phone puzzle, which looks different hanging on the wall in the main scene than it does in the close-up, requires the third number to be one not in the clue list in opposition to the puzzle instructions. The game crashed when I was working on the storage lot puzzle at the end when I accidentally dragged a person off the edge of the puzzle. In addition to all the preceding complaints, I found it really irritating that whenever I was trying to read a page of text, the game would decide it had waited long enough and would exit the text close-up before I could finish reading.There are better HOGs out there. Abyss: The Wraiths of Eden comes to mind."

However, when you're a NY detective in NYC, it's baffling why I have to find batteries in a crime scene to put in a TV remote to work the TV. And that same logic can be said about most of the objects you hunt for. I play HOGs to get lost in their world for a few hours, and I just couldn't with this one.

When you're trapped and battling enchantments it kinda makes sense that you're scrabbling to find coins and bits of wire in order to jury-rig a solution to a problem, but a millionaire, with the full resources of a police department, in New York?  Add to that problems with pacing, such as identifying a critical location then having to visit every other location in order to jump through hoops to retrieve something you could just buy cheaply: it never really engages.The puzzles are ok, if poorly explained, but often rely too much on either rote recall or backtracking from the end, with no tools in place to help you, and some are fairly unresponsive or outright glitchy.So all-in-all a bit dull, really."
