,Not Recommended,301760,12393168,"Posted: 6 October, 2014",all,SupaChigga,"Oh God WHY?Cars 2 was one of my most favorite party games back when I owned an Xbox 360. It had 4 player split screen (for ALL MODES, even the campaign), slick racing, and tons of mechanics such as drifting, driving on 2 wheels, driving backwards, jumping, ramming, and boosting that gave the game a suprisingly high skill ceiling. The highlight of the game was disruptor, a 2v2 match where you had to plant a bomb in the opposing player's base. The only downside to the game was the lack of online multiplayer. Whenever I showed the game to friends who had never played it before, they were always surprised to see how much fun it was despite it being a movie tie in game. Avalanche Studios, the creator of this game, made a hidden gem.This brings me to the review. When I started up Cars 2 on my PC, I was so excited to play it again. That is until I got in game. The sight of the game left me speechless and confused. Cars 2 looks HORRIBLE on PC. The textures on everything are super muddy and stretched out, the sound is equalized so poorly that it constantly cuts out into loud static, and many assets do not show up in game such as street lamps (you only see a string of lights shining on you from middair). I was appalled. The PC version of a game like this should look better or at least equal to the 8 year old console version. Instead, it looks like a game that came out on the PlayStation 2. In fact, it looks Identical to the Nintendo DS version of Cars 2.This revelation led me to start researching what the hell happened. How could a PC port be botched so badly? Here's what I found: The Steam port of Cars 2 was not done by Avalanche, it was done by an obscure company named Gamestar. Gamestar is a CHINESE development company that was established in 2002 and is focused on outsourcing. It has a staff of people who used to work at the Ubisoft Shanghai division. In 2008, Disney acquired the studio and set it to work on porting their games.Disney Interactive VP said during the acquisition, ""Gamestar will play an important role in our global growth plans, providing a high quality talent pool for our expanding product portfolio. Our global expansion is aimed at achieving a new level of creative capacity, quality, and expertise in video game software development.”I sincerely hope the VP chokes on his own horsesh** that he just spewed out of his mouth. Disney bought out this outsourcing company based in CHINA with the sole purpose to lower the cost of porting games. This resulted in this awful, awful port of an originally fantastic game on Steam.Hear me out: I would have been fine with the downgraded graphics, bugs, and annoyances of the port because at its base, Cars 2 is still a very good game. That is until I found the straw that broke the camel's back. I fired up my 4 controllers and hooked them up to my pc ready to have some fun playing a 4 player race just like I did 5 years ago with the Xbox version. Then I saw it. The game only supports 2 player split screen.THATS RIGHT, DISNEY AND GAMESTAR SCREWED UP THE PC PORT SO BADLY THAT IT REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF SPLITSCREEN PLAYERS FROM 4 TO 2.This will be the first (and last) game that I refund on steam. I am so very sad to see what has happened to my favorite party racer. If anyone from Avalanche Studios is reading this, I'm so sorry. I can't imagine what it feels like to put your heart and soul into making a great game only to see it eviscerated by an incompetent outsourced chinese studio. But in the end, it's really Disney's fault. They are a company that seeks the highest possible profit margin, and they are willing to turn great games into abominations like this in order to achieve that.I hope that this review dissuades anyone from buying this game. Avoid any game ported by Gamestar like the plague. There are better racers to choose from on Steam, and the console versions are still avaliable to play.Rest in peace, Cars 2:'("

This PC version looks a lot worse, like Wii graphics, but, in higher resolution.  Don't expect X360 version.  It's blatant false advertising that Valve should look into.  The screenshot version of No Man's Sky false advertising.On the otherhand, it's a decent game, although might be too complicated for young children."

,Not Recommended,301760,25887469,"Posted: 6 October, 2016",all,Aitrus,"This game looks unfinished, big time! It has so many flaws that I can't even know where to start. Gameplay is awful. The whole idea of the game is great (and it's built on an awesome franchise) but it feels... slow. Really! It's a SLOW car game, and not in a good way. I know it's aimed for kids mostly (I actually play it with mine, the only reason I bought this thing) but yet, I cannot avoid yawning a couple of times once I get into a straight part of the circuit... soo slow.Immersion is next to not existent.  Sounds effect aren't there (engine's noise anyone?) Again: yawning. And I don't want to even begin to talk about the scenarios. The tracks themselves are ok but... yet again, this is NOT FINISHED. One of the tracks has this big stands for spectators... and even though there are a couple of NPCs there it feels so EMPTY.  Who would want to go and watch a boring slow race anyways?Music? I don't even know if there's music there... maybe a hint of it but yet again: bo-ri-----ingWhy to bother about user interface (menus and everything)?  They are confusing and buggy (like the whole game which keeps crashing into blank screens from time to time)Please, unless you have a cars-frenzied-three-years-old please DON'T BUY THIS.You will thank me later."

I have to keep this game until I get better at driving games lolReview : I encountered no outstanding performance or stability issues at the time of writing. No DRM or other problems of the like either. People are right - this game looks way worse than the screenshots in terms of visual quality. However it has a good tutorial and the cartoony aesthetic helps it stay relevant despite the downgrade. Also this is one of the few racing games that have an extended tutorial for beginners (and I presume children), and a lot of the controls are forgiving, with afterburner, hard turns, jumping, and even cars that will put wheels on side walls rather than bump in them making the gameplay a lot easier for someone as bad as me so I will keep this along until I find something way better."

Bu oyun hikayeyi tamamen kaldırmasına rağmen Silahlar ve güzel bölüm dizaynlarıyla olayı güzelce toparlamış. Tabii hikaye olmadığı için mecburen En sevdiğim Cars oyunu olan ''Cars 1''in gerisinde kaldı.Hadi oyuna bir bakalımOynanışOynanış gerçekten başarılı. Kontrollerin eski oyunlara göre daha iyi olduğunu söyleyebilirim. Ve ikinci filmden mütevellit oyuna koyulan silah olayı da harika kullanılmış bence. Gerçekten harika. Oyunun kaderini tamamen değiştirebildiğini söyleyebilirim. Yeri kayganlaştıran benzin, Roketatar ve minigunlar bu yeni özelliklerden birkaçı. Akıcı kontroller ile de daha da eğlenceli olmuş.GrafiklerEvvet. Diğer oyunların da gerisinde kalan tek eksik bu. Bu oyun Cars: Meter-National Champhionship den bile daha iyi gözüküyor. Onun grafikleri ile şimdi bi Cars oyunu yapılsa hala insanı tatmin eder. Ama bu oyunda maalesef bunu göremiyoruz. Gerçekten hiç özenilmemiş. Şehir dizaynları falan hoş dursa da araba modellemeleri gerçekten iyi gözükmüyor.Sonuç olarak diğer oyunların üzerine bir şeyler koyduğu için bu oyunu öneririm. Tamam o aile ortamı falan bu oyunda yok ama gerçekten aksiyon dolu ve eğlenceli saatler geçirebilirsiniz. İyi Oyunlar :)"

Oh, this is something.First the images shown are not from the game. They must be doctored 360/ps3 images. This game looks no where near as good. Infact this looks far worse than Cars 2006. No lighting effect, or god rays. No complex texturing or detail on the cars. This is seriously a combo of early Dreamcast and PS1. Though you can run it at 1080 with 60fps. Still the 360 version is many times better visually even running at 720 and 30 fps. Let me put this another way. Sweet Fx couldn't help this train reck. No reflection built in to the car bodies, no ambiet occlusion, no shadows(NONE), very low shading, and the headlights look painted on. This is the worst looking game I have played in well over a decade. Such a shame.So how is the game? Great! Well not as good as the 360/ps3... The lack of visuals is so forboding. The real problem here is NO DLC! The ammount of cars in the 360 version is staggering. Chick Hicks, DJ, Snot Rod, ect. All voiced. Here there is nothing. I'm sure there is more missing as well. The gameplay feels looser as well. So overall this is the worst version of a great game.Do buy this one. It is aweful, and easily replaces Arkam Knight in my worst port ever, since even at launch it was much better than this. Plus they have fixed that. This however is terrible. Go buy Mater Nationals instead, it is by far the best PC Cars game. Grab the Hi Octane mod and goto town. Just stay away from this game. What were they thinking?"

But alot stuff is missing. Even the texture and graphic/lighting is way more different and worse, And animated Cars UI on the left side is a Car image instead of animated car. Even Cars Mater National is better than this. I even enjoy Cars 2 on Play Station Portable. But PC version just so bad..Not recommend for those who came from Play Station 3 who think it's the same.The Graphic showed on screenshot at the Store Page is from Play Station 3 or XBOX 360! It's not even close to PC/Steam Version."

Mostly filled with British Special Agents of the Secret Service for Motor-Vehicles.The game forces you to play mutiple Tutorial scenarios to learn how to push the left arrow key to drive left and right arrow key to turn right. Sounds pretty damn basic and boring.Just like the other Cars game, would only recommend this to kids or if you're a parent wanting to play something with your kid(s).3/10"
