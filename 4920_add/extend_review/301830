The gameplay is just swinging swords and shooting arrows at weird ""animals"" and it's basically ""these 10 doors are locked. finish one, and another unlocks until you clear the blight of some sort, and your mum is fine""No graphics options except for resolutions. It runs fine, but there's a reason. It's looks god awful. No AA, textures are a nightmare, and is generally crap.Don't buy, please, don't buy."

It has a ""Lego Starwars"" feel to it.  There are some clever puzzles and game play mechanics.  The voice acting is excellent.After playing with both a mouse and keyboard and a controller, IHighly recommend using a controller."

The controls are solid once you get used to them.I bought this game with the Disney Princess pack for my daughter - and I think this is her favorite so far!   She does get stuck, and needs my help every now and then - but she does very well for only 3!I would recommend this game for anyone with younger children wanting to step them up into an action game."

Keep in mind it IS a game for children, however, there's just enough challenge to make it a good, fun play. You can choose your level of difficulty as well, ranging from easy all the way to Brave. No, you're not going to find the greatest graphics, but it's certainly worth the money spent if you're looking for a simple yet entertaining adventure."

Usually, movie themed games are usually bad and some are downright garbage.This one is not. It's actually a pretty good 3d action platformer. The puzzles are a bit on the easy side of course. You got voice acting by the voice of Merida (Kelly McDonald).I find that the game can be challenging on Brave difficulty.  I strongly recommend using a controller for this game. Keyboard users beware! Don't get me wrong. my review is not biased because i love Merida."

ONLY the cameras sometimes is a bit wonky and wont show you always your point for landing (while jumping)A few words to the Combat:It changes between melee and bow, with 4 different elements, sounds maybe a bit strange at first, but allows you to do fast and strong combos. You need one of these ""elements"" to get more damage on special enemies, they got mixed later thats what makes the fighting more interessting.-Oh yeah and you got an shop for buying skills, and thats REALLY a lot of skillsSO many words for a game like THIS but, i think the game is REALLY STRONG UNDERRATED.So if you want an platform like ""hack and slay"" with combos for young and old, with not to hard challenges for a bit relaxing, you do NOTHING, NOTHING wrong.DEFINITELY the 20Bucks worth."

The gameplay is unique in my eyes, and getting all the upgrades isn't very hard.But this game is definitely not for all types of gamers, which probably explains itself (not much action, progressive style etc.)"
,Recommended,301830,33208496,Posted: 3 July,all,Navin R Johnson,"My 5 year old son and I played this game together and thoroughly enjoyed it. I picked it up for $4.99 (on sale) and it was worth every penny. My only gripes would be that it seemed a little too easy and the big boss battle at the end kind of felt rushed. Why didnt we fight the bear?Overall, it was a great time and we will be looking for similar style games to play together!"
,Recommended,301830,13857045,"Posted: 5 January, 2015",all,JuStX2,"Game doesn't have overly graphic violence but it could easily earn E10+ Rating unlike every other game in the Disney Princesses and Fairies Pack which minus Tangled would probably only qualify for E. And what do you know, a game in that pack actually has a HEALTH meter, that does something for a change. These qualties make it a kinda odd fit for the pack which is targetted at young girls. Still the game is of good enough quality to the point that even someone of adult age-group (other than myself - I'm a bit of an oddball) could actually find it enjoyable. Throwing this game into the pack seems like their trying to toss a bone to the older princesses, some of whom may be a bit tomboyish.As an individual game the design is not overly unique, plays similiar to Trine or Zelda-style games. The controls take a little practice to get used to because the tutorials don't show key ""letters"" but rather ""colors"" that correspond to the keymap on the game's controls menu. Camera is automatic but it seems to keep a good prespective so far. Weapon choice makes a large difference in how quickly mobs go down, and charms further agument that process. In addition to Action/Adventure/RPG it has some puzzle elements, which if I do say so myself are kinda interesting; Still the game would be better if it allowed for Character Swap on-the-fly instead of only in certain scenes. Personally I hold no feelings of disinterest in the game hence a ""good"" review, but it doesn't stand out as something overly special either."

It took us a little while before we discovered that you can play 2 players at the same time. The game is too challenging for a 7 year old alone so the 2 player option is great, She can just be the sprite and respawn right next to me anytime she dies. This game is a lot of fun!"
,Recommended,301830,15958943,"Posted: 22 May, 2015",all,ocelot.wg,This game is fantastic. Not because of the plot (meh) or graphics (meh) but because it's easy to jump in and out of. It's a great way to waste time here and there. Everything about the game is totally adequate and it makes the game quite enjoyable. I used an Xbox controller but I'm sure keyboard/mouse would be just fine.

,Recommended,301830,20010857,"Posted: 27 December, 2015",all,mercilius,Bought this game for my 6 year old daughter.  She loves it!  It's really well done.  The controls work well and the graphics are quite nice.  Everything feels polished.  I really appreciate that the difficulty level can be adjusted.  There are a lot of games that she has a tough time playing because she just started using a controller... this is a great game for that.
76561198041472717,Recommended,301830,20275330,"Posted: 3 January, 2016",all,ShadowolfIncubi,"Well, the film wasn't entirely what I'd hoped for (maybe in a sequel someday, it'll get the Mulan-like war tale it deserves!), but me being into Scottish culture (plus the Scots got the best accents in the world bar none), I loved all the Scottish elements and loved Merida as a strong, independent female, so overall, really liked the film to pick this game up on Xmas sale!The game takes some liberties from the film for gameplay purpose, so we get to explore a lil' more of (a stylized) Scottish/Gaelic nature, outside the films (like the Causeways I guess reminisce Fingal's Cave).Gameplay:Knowing that this game was made for kids... I jumped into playing this game on the most difficult ""Brave"" setting (enemies have way more health and you die in 2-3 hits), so my review is in this context. Even then, it is pretty easy... particularly since you may find one of your arrow attacks extremely overpowered for practically all enemy types (despite them having elemental weaknesses to certain elemental arrows).  On this difficulty, some of the bosses do prove a genuinely difficult challenge though, as you die in 2 hits, and fight a giant creature on a crowded stage. You might die a lot in Dark Souls kinda way then. (I wanna add, to avoid any disappointment like I felt - no, you won't really get to fight Mor'du =( )Level designs are linear, but are never really boring either... they're just the right length, I'd say.You do have to suspend your disbelief a bit in some of Merida's skills... they gave her a double jump (*groan* at this trope, but it's useful given the wonky camera angles) and ninja/parkour wall jumps. And as skilled an archer as she is, she doesn't nock her arrows, just fires them quickly like a gun (holding the fire button, charges your arrows for elemental multi-shots).I like that you can upgrade your skills though, it has a slight, light-RPG feel to it... you won't get everything by the end of the game either. There is a Co-Op feature where a second player can play as a wisp. I didn't play with a friend, but experimented with it via keyboard a bit, and it reminds me a little bit of Tails in the classic Sonic games (game stays fixed on Merida; Wisp doesn't die, and can teleport back to Merida if lost).There are small sequences you play as Merida's bear mum, where you just rampage and slaughter as many enemies as possible. It's not that fun, and controls are clunky too, but they're fortunately super short and easy. There are also short puzzles where you play as Merida's triplet brothers on each level. They are also super easy (designed for kids, after all). Fortunately, you can skip them when you revisit a stage too.Controls:Definitely recommended to play with a controller - controls are fairly solid! An enemy-lock on feature could've been nice, maybe, but you are quite busy running and dodging a variety of enemies. Could've been nice for bosses though. One of the control features I REALLY like that is kinda unique, is that you can fire at any direction you point via Right Analog Stick.Camera isn't bad... but there are times when it could be much better, especially when platform jumping (you'll need to use your shadow for context on where to properly land; there is no falling to your death, you simply quickly ""teleport"" back up with a little loss of health... so not a big deal), or hunting for secrets beyond the scope of the camera angles. It's also sorta problematic in boss fights when you move Merida ""up"" the stage, and your boss stays to the foreground, you can lose sight of your target entirely and could easily be killed for not seeing an incoming attack. That said, the fixed cameras otherwise do offer some nice cinematic feeling to the landscapes.Art Direction (Graphics/Sound):Scenery is pretty, very lush and green (even if not super detailed) and loosely represent Scottish/Gaelic landscapes (though linear designs means none of the open Highlands). Character models, however, are not so great. Merida looks a bit unfinished, with these unintentional tired, baggy eyes. Bears look like plastic toys (not furry). I enjoy some of the cinematic hand-drawings (though they are limitly animated).No real complaints on sound design, I enjoy the cinematic orchestral Celtic music, which are soaring and adventurous. Kelly Macdonald reprises her role, which is wonderful (because I love her and her voice!).Overall:It's a fun, fairly solid kid's adventure/platformer game, even despite some shortcomings, and I recommend it too if you liked the movie... if you're an avid gamer, play it on ""Brave"" difficulty. Again, not hard, but the bosses pose a genuine challenge."

I have only played about an hour and a half so far but as a platformer it is rather fun. Kind of like Lego Star Wars meets Pixar Brave. Lots of things to bust open and many hidden things/areas to find. Just like the Lego games it has replayable levels to gain access to hidden areas once you attain new items in later levels. I actually enjoy the puzzles presented when you have to control the three brother bears. Not too challenging and fun. Game combat is also enjoyable, similar to most any dungeon crawler. I was nicely surprised when the game naturally recognized my cheap Logitech controller. Far better than trying to play this with the keyboard."

I try to enjoy this game but there are too many problems with it. When i first enter the game it is always flashing continously so i restart my computer twice and after that it i find it works... for a little bit. When i just think i've sorted everything out it gets me out of the game and says theres a problem with it and windows will try find the solution. No matter what i do i can't stop this and it annoys the crap out of me. Secondly while playing Brave i can't even get out of the game to message someone on Skype or quickly check something because when i go back on it, it starts flashing again. Thirdly when you earn a new ability from a chest and it shows you what to press it just comes up with coloured ovals, rectangles and squares. It has no key on them whatsoever, no numbers no letters, just colours. This really frustrates me as i then have to pause the game, go onto the controls continously and check how to do something. Also if my pc comes up with a message saying 10% left, plug in charger it gets me out of the game and then when i go back in it  also begins to flash! I've tried researching how to fix this problem and kept changing the resolution but nothing helps. I really want to enjoy this game and recommend it to everyone but it's impossible to play because of these reasons. Of course i will continue to play this amazing game but please oh please try and fix these problems! thank you :-)."
