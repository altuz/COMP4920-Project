I don't get the chance to play many splitscreen games anymore, my friends have got kids now and such.. But playing online it's still splitscreen so it still has that ""local"" splitscreen feel to it, probably even more so when you get mics on and get a few beers in with some online buddies :)You can also incorperate local and online mp, so you could have you and your friend sitting next to you, while playing 4 player splitscreen with 2 more players over the internet!It's a very interesting concept and the weapons have a nice feel to them like you would want in an FPS game, movement is fast paced, guns feel solid and engaging and generally it's just alot of fun and a very unique  way of bringing back splitscreen gaming era"

,Recommended,301970,11487265,"Posted: 30 July, 2014",all,WombatGhost,"An enjoyable game for those who think CoD matches are too slow.Screencheat requires you to be on the move constantly whereas games like CoD, BF, and the likes all have their campers.  In this game, other players can see exactly where you are(at least from your/their point of view) so camping is useless since they can see what you are seeing and kill you from behind. Because of that, you have to be moving non-stop while also glancing at the other three screens to see where the opponents are. It's a lot harder than it sounds because glancing at the other screens is a near requirement to survive however the intensity of the game makes it hard for one to glance away from your little quadrant on the screen. The maps are quite small so there is little to no moments for reprieve during a match lest you be blown away by a well aimed grenade. Certain map functions like air vents increase your mobility and allows you to do sneak attacks but be prepared to be shot out of the air due to the predictability of the air vents.There are only two gamemodes at this time: A free for all Deathmatch and a King of the Hill match. A King of the Hill match is basically camping(if you can even call it that) at a specific location to gather points while waiting for the inevitable death to claim you in the form of a blunderbuss or a grenade. Deathmatch currently only supporst to 10 points per game so a player has to get to 10 kills max.Currently, there are two maps available. The first is a Museum map with a huge fossil in the middle. There is a ramp that leads to the top, an elevator that leads you to the top floor, and an air vent that drags you to the floor below it. It's quite easy to score points on this map (IMO) because the ramp makes enemy movements extremely predictable. The second map is a garden with air vents on the bottom of the floor that can boost you to around the middle of the map or even farther. The map is slightly symmetrical in it's shape and is a lot harder to get kills on(for me at least). One positive note about this map is that in a 4 player server or 2 player server, the map's color changes so you can easily locate the enemy. In a two player server, one half of the map is blue while the other is red. In a 4 player server, the map is split into quadrants with a different color in each. Despite this, I still failed at this map compared to the Museum :pA small thing to note is the kill feed which is EXTREMELY satisfying. More often than not, it gives a small line at the top of the screen that says ""_____ creamed ____"" or something that basically says that you got owned. A few times, the entire screen would be filled with the text in CAPS basically rubbing it into your face that you were killed or that you killed someone. It's hilarious but causes you to screw up because you can't see where you're going and you cam be killed by another player in the few short seconds the message stays on the screen. But it is satisfying XD"

He's saying ""yes sir, no sir"". So my other 2 friends and i are trying to figure out who hes talking to. We know its not his dad becuase he dosent say yes sir alot to his dad.

It not only brings back splitscreen in a new dynamic way, but also the old style of arena shooters in general - something which some developers are pushing for a modern day revival. Happy Cheating!"

Screencheat is one of the games I bought that fit this criteria. The game is pretty simple in concept, but there's tons of different modes, weapons, and maps to keep you entertained. My friends and I even stuck to just the basic deathmatch mode and didn't get bored with it for quite some time. I've never tried online multiplayer to see how that would work with latency and all, but for splitscreen this is an absolute blast.

Goldeneye Source has been around for over ten years now and Timesplitters Rewind is in the works. Wish the game gained more attention to the public eye.

Gamers have been doing this for years. Now, grab a drink and listen closely, this is where it gets juicy!Back in the old days of FPS' on consoles (N64, PS1, ect. ect.) when you wanted to play a game with a friend, you grabbed your extra controllers, went to a friends house, and all sat down in front of the same TV. When playing multiplayer, you all shared a ""chunk"" of the screen, and the ""rule"" was to keep your eyes on YOUR ""chunk"" of the TV, and no one elses.Not everyone followed that rule.People would look at the other players ""chunks"" and found out where their friends were hiding, what they were doing, and pretty much knew everything that was needed to be known to find that player, destroy them.But what they didn't realize is that they were destroying friendships, and honorable play.This technique of looking at the other players ""chunks"" was soon named ""Screenpeeking"", or ""Screenlooking"". It was a technique that was hated by everyone, and it was a general rule not to do it.That was the old days, and due to advancements in technology, you don't have to worry about it anymore.Now, imagine if there was a game where the only way to win was Screenlooking?WELCOME TO SCREEN CHEAT!In this game, everyone in invisible, but, you can see everyones screen, no matter where they are playing from!

You're invisible, they're invisible and the only way to see them is to check their screens for a location. You'd think it would be easy but sometimes it takes quite a bit of skill to split your attention between four screens, keeping eyes on all your enemies and of course, on yourself. But don't think that just because they can see your screen that they'll know where you are. Some of the maps so far have been a dizzying mix of colours and shapes that don't always match up with what you're seeing.In any case, I would definitely recomend this game, especially for LANs or parties as having people within shouting distance while you play makes it all the more fun.

This game ranks up there with golden-eye, halo, timesplitters , etc. Screen cheat has that perfect blend of nostalgia but also throws some new ideas into the mix for a fun local multiplayer experience. Everyone is invisible, so the only way to find anyone on the map is to screen cheat, and you do this by using the different colors on the map to determine where the other players are. Its a simple concept but it plays so well that you'll be screaming at your friends and having a great time. The weapons themselves are not your typically fps weapons. sure you have your standard shotgun, called the blunder bust, and the semi-auto sniper, which is the revolver rifle. Then you have the weirder weapons such as the candle abra, which is just a candle stick melee weapon and the Wall hack, which, as the name implies, goes through walls using a small beam to aim. There are a variety of game modes and a handful of maps and the developers are always adding something new to the game which keeps it fresh and entertaining to play again and again. Overall its a great buy, especially if you like splitscreen fps games."

,Recommended,301970,12707212,"Posted: 31 October, 2014",all,MECHnation,"Screencheat. The multiplayer topic not many of us have said about since N64 day's of GoldenEye. But now, Aussie (yes!) studio's; Samurai Punk and Surprise Attack! Games have made a game where the only way to win, is to screencheat, and this game is called... Screencheat (not a very original name, I know). In this multiplayer only shooter that can be played locally or online (or a bit of both) has you and up to three friends battle it out in the five arena's that have been made, where you must only do one thing, KILL EVERYONE! But it's not that simple because, everyone is invisible so you must screencheat to know where they are. Obsiously, many of you will go; ""But wouldn't you only see your screen on an online match?"" Well the answer that wheather you are playing online or not, you will see everyone's screen's. I really enjoyed this game, I played mostly with my brother and... it ruin's your LIFE! (ish). It's just so fun, knowing that your enemy is somehwere, but you don't really know where he/she is. My only real problem is that there isn't exactly enough content here, as I said, there are currently only 5 maps, FIVE. And while the six or so game modes including ""Murder Mystery"", which is basically Cluedo: The Videogame. Maybe having Workshop support would fix this problem. I also found a few bugs here and there, but I'm sure they will be patched out. Overall, I really enjoyed this game and hope it is constanly updated. Not many maps and qutie a few bugs do ruin it a little bit, but the funny things that pop up after killing someone are just funny. For a game that recently came out, I enjoyed it, just make sure you have lots of friends. I'm giving it 8/10 Times I slamed my hand on the table because I got killed. (GO AUSTRALIA!!!)"
,Recommended,301970,14749911,"Posted: 5 March, 2015",all,Bootleg Jones,"Remember the good old days of local split-screen multiplayer? Remember how you could just look at your friend's screen to see where they were at any given time, even if they had an invisibility power-up? Well, this game was designed around that type of strategy and as far as I know is the only retail game in existence to have online split-screen multiplayer in an FPS. It's invisible screen-peeking instagib madness, and it's the most fun I've had in an FPS in a long time.Many people argue that ""screen peeking"" is cheating, but in this game it's the only way to win since everyone is invisible until gibbed... or fragged... or eliminated... or slammed... or unfriended... or corrupted... or #PWN'd... or any verb the kill feed decides to use. And then you find out your ragdoll is a humanoid chicken, or a man with the head of a horse, or even just a good old fashioned skeleton. The game is very silly and doesn't take itself too seriously, which only adds to the fun. Even the weapons are silly, including a remote detonated bouncing bear bomb, a stick horse that allows you to charge at your opponents, and a candelabra that acts as a standard melee attack, as well as a more traditional blunderbuss (shotgun) and revolver.Every stage is split into 4 colored areas, and for the most part they all have some kind of symmetry to them, but they still manage to be unique and some are almost just as maze-like as the old Goldeneye 64 maps. Overall, I'd say this is an excellent game to mess around with friends in, and the 4-pack is definitely worth it if you can afford it or get your friends to chip in."

Remember sticking to your own screen to avoid being called out as a screen cheat? WELL FORGET ALL THAT CRAP! Screen Cheat is a unique game that requires you to use the dirtiest of split screen moves. Players are invisible and the only way to kill them is to look at their screens, the game puts 4 (I'm not sure if it can play more than 4 players) players screens all on one screen so everyone can see what each other is equipped with and where they are on the map. You must use your skills and a range of wacky weapons to elimininate your opponents.

YOU WILL DIE REGARDLESS OF SKILL. It is incredibly fun to measures that are practically unmeasurable. If you're one of those people who just can't help it but look upon your opponents screen in order to locate them, then why not add a challenge to it but doing it deliberatly.There are some problems though that i do feel should be accounted...1) Level design is quite confusing for the recently added maps (and when i mean confusing, i mean u can't even navigate through them without getting lost yourself, let alone trying to focus on your opponents screen)2)In order to win, most players will usually just look upwards whenever they are on a map with no hazards and walk around in order to locate you3)The crossbow is incredibly glitchy (you will see why)4)Online lobby is really bad, and I dont say this lightly5)No solo playOverall its a pretty fantastic game, minus the few problems that have been stated above. I would definetly play it more once it increases in popularity, but for now people should really only get this game if its on sale or they have friends and are able to configure controls onto their PC.

At best it's an hour or two of fun, and certinally not worth the asking price. The game expects you to see the other players, on maps that you don't know (and can't possibly learn, as they are just a mess of bright colours, and are symetrical) and somehow shoot them, even though you cannot see them. Yes, that's the premise of the game, but just *think about that for a moment*... How much *fun* is that going to be? It's clever, but is it *fun*? For me, the answer was no.Also, the game frequently glitched for me; when someone joined or left the game, it would often still divde the screen by the old number of players, whilst trying to squash in the new number of players. This resulted in a unplayable game. Given this game is in version 3.whatever, that's kinda inexcusable. I triggered this bug several times in my short (less than 1 hour) time playing this game.I requested a refund in less than one hour of playing. This game, was, frankly, terrible.

While it is designed to emulate games such as GoldenEye on the N64, it plays like Quake or Unreal. I find myself constantly in motion and flying all over the map, while using weapons very reminiscent of the ones found in Unreal Tournament.Screencheat is fun without friends, if you're a lonely PC gamer, but just like any splitscreen multiplayer match, its designed to be played with friends. Utterly overwhelming to begin with, but accompanied with a fiendly learning curve somehow, Screencheat is a great game to pick up. I purchased it 50% off at $7.49 and liked it so much after the first couple hours that I bought it for my friend as well.Currently, there are probably 8-10 weapons, gamemode and maps. All the weapons function very independently and are therefore quite unique. All of the gamemodes are fun. Some of them, like Hillcampers, are gamemodes you'll recognize from other games, while others, like Murder Mystery, are completely unique and refreshing. All of the maps are incredibly well designed and, while most of them are tiny, they fit the purpose of the game. I never felt cramped.As far as ""incredibly well designed..."" if you decide to play Screencheat, you'll probably notice within the first few games what I mean."

The game itself is good but it doesn't even have a single player mode and there are persistent problems with online due to lack of players. I would not recommend this game in its current state despite the high quality polish of the actual game :'(
,Not Recommended,301970,17435247,"Posted: 7 August, 2015",all,TepidArtifact21,"The game is alright, though at the current price, not worth it. The maps are designed very well, and it's pretty easy to ""screencheat"", however the weapons are god-awful. One hit kills, meaning any actual fighting or weapon design can't take place. The blunderbuss is the only weapon you will ever use. Period.  The other thing is, weapons reveal you too much (or don't reveal you enough at all) and the game's speed should be faster.If there was a button to recommend ""with caution"" I would, but I just can't recommend wholeheartedly."

I glitched it in the offline somehow and was playing against myself. I didn't know who I wanted to win but I was really trying to get them to aim and shoot each other. Was pretty impossible and couldn't do it but I just played a few times and enjoyed trying to pinpoint myself. And for those who are wondering, I was only using the keyboard. No controllers connected. So whatever one guy did, the other one did. Pretty amazing and I would not care if that glitch was never patched. Just makes it so I can enjoy some single player time. Love the game and can't wait for the full version."

People unwilling to let spectators join the game by not returning to lobby or intentionnally delaying the game, getting cussed out of lobbies, and just rude people in general. While this may not be the game developers fault for rude people, there are many flaws that the creators should be responsible for. In the off chance that you do get into a game, you can only play 1 or 2 consecutive rounds before the game freezes on you and forces you to reopen the game. There should be a public lobby system so that you aren't forced to pick between privately hosted servers. The weapons are unbalanced and overall it just isn't very satisfying.It is a wonderful concept with poor execution.3/10 for me."

In this tournament, each round would feature a different indie game where everyone earned points.  After 5 rounds, the top 4 players went on to a final round.  I made this game one of the rounds and it was so much fun!  I normally don't like FPS that are only multiplayer but this game though, this game is an exception because of how it is played.  Everyone is invisible!  They only way you can find someone to shoot them is but SCREEN CHEATING!  Hints the name.  I also have to give the dev props for constantly updating this game and keeping it fresh.  Fun!  Get it!  GET IT NOW!!!"

Even the timed trials singleplayer is enough to satiate a temporary yearning for change in games, however without people to play and socialise with, once the session starts the game begins to feel like a little monotonous and boring once the first 20 mins of gameplay wear off.The music is pretty funky and the design choices the devs made with this game really complement the silliness of both the weapons and the atmosphere of the game.Overall, 8/10"
