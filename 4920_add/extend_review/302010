,Not Recommended,302010,13653223,"Posted: 27 December, 2014",all,Jeneki,"While it is pretty to look at, The Blue Flamingo is rather underwhelming as a game.1) Control lag and movement inertia.  I hope you don't like having fine control over your ship.  It makes the game vastly less enjoyable to play as a result.2) Enemy design is incredibly basic.  There's a lot of the same enemy from the last level, who flies the exact same way and shoots the exact same way, over and over, level after level.  There are even enemies that litereally do nothing but take a bunch of hits.  Nothing remotely interesting starts to show up until you've looped the game around six times.3) Weapons are dull and uninteresting.  Leveling up your shot only increases fire rate.  No shot type selection or variety to choose from.4) Color selection.  In most games of this type, certain colors are reserved for important information (such as enemy bullets), so they are always visible and clear.  The nighttime cityscape background breaks this basic design rule, as bullets and enemies blend seamlessly into the background colors.  Lucky for us enemy fire is absurdly predictable.5) Menus ignore your button config; you always have to press enter to do anything regardless of what you set for your action buttons.  Also they use blinking text to show what you are highlighting, meaning you have to wait a second just to see what you're actually selecting.In conclusion, The Blue Flamingo has sloppy controls and uninteresting gameplay.  Not recommended.If you're looking for good shmups on Steam, I can recommend: Crimzon Clover, Kamui, Jamestown, Alltynex 2nd, Astebreed, Danmaku Unlimited 2, Ether Vapor Remaster, RefleX, and Satazius."

,Not Recommended,302010,13763992,"Posted: 1 January, 2015",all,Imban,"The Blue Flamingo is a neat ""art game"" that has a unique artstyle created by actually building the terrain and all the ships in miniature and then converting photographs and video of them into the background and sprites used in the game. Somewhat defying the tendencies of ""typical"" art games, it's actually a shoot-'em-up, rather than a puzzle platformer or walking simulator.Unfortunately, that's around where the neatness ends - it's a fairly short score attack game, where you play through more or less the same two levels repeatedly, just getting slightly more difficult each time, with very clunky controls. The shortness in terms of content is likely due to the limitations of the artstyle, which constrained them to only having one model for the terrain because building an impressively detailed 32-foot-long model is hard and only so many models for enemies, as those too had to be hand-built and hand-painted, but the loose controls are less forgivable, as they combine with the lack of ability to restore your health to make a game where you're rewarded for playing very conservatively, which ends up feeling rather boring.In the end, I can't really recommend The Blue Flamingo because ultimately it doesn't hold up as anything except a neat visual experience."

After all, you only have one craft.Every time you destroy an enemy you get points and $$ or a coin (seems to have more value) if you actually manage to destroy a wave of enemies before disappearing out of the screen.At the end of the level you can upgrade your bullets or booms with the money you earn.I really like the feel of the sceneries and the game fluidity.

,Not Recommended,302010,13812278,"Posted: 3 January, 2015",all,Erbkaiser,"The Blue Flamingo is a visually very pleasing game and could have been a really good shmup, but in this genre you need perfect controls without any lag, and there it fails.The Blue Flamingo definitely has an interesting art style. All the aircraft, missiles, laser platforms and other things you encounter are actual models, and all the explosives etc. are also made from miniature pyrotechnics. You're also flying above what looks to be model landscapes as backgrounds.The music on the other hand is uninteresting and the soundeffects are decidedly standard, but not to the point of annoyance.There are too few enemy variations which is perhaps understandable since everything had to be photographed from actual models but worse is that they all use the same patterns. The challenge in most shmups comes from the variance in enemies and their different patterns, here the challenge is simply increased by giving you more enemies to deal with at the same time.That in itself is not a big issue, worse is that like any shmup, The Blue Flamingo lives and dies by the accuracy and responsiveness of its controls. That is where I have issues with this game. Controlling it with an Xbox360 controller works decently enough, but several times I got damaged or lost because I ran into a bullet or missile which I was sure I had dodged -- and I had, but the control was a little laggy in registering.This will not be much of an issue for the first two levels or so and you might not even notice it but as soon as the sceen becomes busier, you will begin getting annoyed by how unresponsive your ship feels.If you get this at a decent price, TBF may be worth your time if you want to check out a unique visual style, but I cannot recommend it to people looking for a serious shmup."

The audio is great as it doesn't distract from the game itself, the music doesn't drown out the sound effects, nor does the reverse happen, it's a great balance.As for the controls being imprecise, grab a deck of cards guys, deal. Play it enough and you'll learn to cope, I have and I've only played maybe 45 minutes at this point. That's not to say I'm very good at it, I've never been particularly good at shmups but I like them well enough I guess, and this one I particularly enjoy.Give it a decent chance and you'll most likely enjoy it as well!"

I just dig that handmade look, just what I also loved in The Swapper and The Dream Machine. But where as The Swapper and The Dream Machine are actually great games, with great design, The Blue Flamingo unfortunately isn't, and it's a shame, it really is. The look and the soundtrack had a great foundation, especially from athmosphere point of view, but the game and level design part fails hard. It is just boring to play, unsatisfied. I hate to be this mean with my assumptions, but to me it almost looks like the developers have not played a lot of classic shoot 'em ups, haven't got what makes those games great. The controls feel also somehow a bit off, also collision model. But those are minor gripes compared to the downright bad level design.Buy it for the art, but don't expect to enjoy it more than 10 minutes."

The premise is that you are a pilot and you come to shoot some flying objects and get a high score … so you do.  It keeps it short and sweet.  Get the high score and compare it to your friends and the world on the leader board.VisualsThis game looks beautiful!  There are gorgeous desert landscapes that you fly over with excellent details that you probably miss as you focus on dodging bullets and missiles.  The game essentially has 2 levels; rust colored desert landscape and a dark blue night flight.  The design gives a very steam punk feel.  Almost like you are playing in the world of Lost Exile (Look it up. It is a great series.  See pic below).  All of the graphics for the bullets, ships, environment and explosions are crisp clean.  The simplistic color palette, crisp details and beautiful environments are the highlight of this game.Van ShipAudioThere are two soundtracks in this game.  One for each level.  They match perfectly with the overall theme.  On the rustic southwest level you have some old time guitar rifts that fit right in.  The colorful night level has a more upbeat jazz sound track that makes me continually want to dance my ship across the screen when there are no targets.  The sound effects are really crisp.  I feel like I can hear every nut and bolt ping off the rocks below.ControlsThere is not much to say about the controls in this game.  They are simplistic controls that use 1 joystick for navigation with 2 buttons to attack. They were very responsive and need to be as the game gradually progresses from simplistic shooter to bullet hell as you complete each level.GameplayThe gameplay is very simplistic and also very clever.  The idea is to get the highest score which in this game is represented through money.  You collect money by shooting down aerial objects.  You also collect coins when you shoot down “teams” of targets.  You get bonus money at the end of each round by testing your skills in target practice.  All of this is pretty standard fare for a shooter.  Blue Flamingo has one caveat that makes that quest for the highest score that much more interesting.  At the end of the level, you have the option of spending your points to upgrade your weapons.  By upgrading your weapons you stand a better chance for surviving.  The problem is that you just spent a chunk of your score to have a better chance at the next level.  You also collect a small amount of interest on your money while playing.  So if you choose to improve your plane than you also choose to make less money on the points that you have already earned.  That simple twist makes this game endless fun.  It allows you to try new methods of spending your points to maximize your overall score.OverallI definitely give this game 4.5/5.0 Bricks.  The catchy music and beautiful environments make this simplistic shooter a joy to play as you find that perfect balance to achieve your high score.For more go tohttp://brick-media.com/blue-flamingo/"

The lack of extra lives (maybe you can get them with a high score but I haven't played enough to be very good at it to unlock them if so..) as well as a lack of end-level bosses is a bit of a dissapointment, as huge end level bosses seem to be a staple of this genre of game.

However I also have come to appreciate that their products often lack a certain detail or orchestration which seperates a good game from a great game.There are a LOT of negative reviews to this game which I simply do not concur with. Most of them are aimed at control response. Having used a controller myself I found no such issues and if there ever was controller issues, they seemed to have been fixed.The second major complaint is replayability, this critique actually has some weight behind it. The problem is that it takes too long to raise up the ranks again and the game never changes. Not many people have that much time to dedicate to a game like this and there is no saves, ability to repair ship or kept upgrades which allows a gamer to explore the later levels more easily or quicker. So for many it feels like there's a Lot to the game which they have paid good money for which they will never get to enjoy or experience.This top down shooter requires you to traverse the same 32 feet beautiful model of a landscaped town over and over again raising the ranks and alternating between night and day. Each level prsents more or new enemies. Your simple clunky ship known as the blue famingo has two weapons available. Simply normal fire which can be upgraded for more quicker fire and you have infinite bombs which reload capability can be quickened through upgrades after each level. You will immediately start to earn 10% each level for any money unspent meaning it might be in your best interest to save the money for a few levels and rely on some skillful dodging and selection of which enemies you blow up and which ones you leave.You also get rewarded coins for any collections of enemies you take down. For instance if you come across a flight of 3 enemies in close formation and you blow up all three, then you will recieve an additional reward of a coin you need to collect before it disappears,  if you blow up only two of them you do not. On top of all this each level is seperated by a target practice session where the object is to turn all the flying discs that are red to green and if they are already green to leave them. Here your bombs can also help. Each disc you get right your rewarded with $100.00 .Personally I have finished level 12 and did not discover any new enemies after level 9, instead it just challenged me with more of them. I have messaged developers requesting any information if there are greater enemies after this but no one has replied, so in all honesty level 10 may be all that this game has to really offer. For those that want to challenge themselves by raising their ranks through the high score will be greeted by scores off this planet thanks to cheaters. Hence very little replayability for the honest gamer here.Still its a decent game which I have enjoyed. Presented well but the mechanics lack that certain finesse which rewards some people from thinking that they have got all their monies worth from this game. Still recommended by me nevertheless... Why? Me level 12, my room mate level 4. I never let him live it down...http://mightanddelight.com/the-blue-flamingo/"

,Recommended,302010,14298953,"Posted: 2 February, 2015",all,Graced by Autumn,"As with all forms of entertainment media, games come in a wide variety of different flavours. There are genres, and then there are sub-genres, and even sub-genres of sub-genres. Not every game is for everyone. In particular, the shmup genre is known for its niche appeal. Yet strangely, The Blue Flamingo is one of the few games that may find appeal across a surprisingly wide spectrum of audiences, due in part to the simple nature of its core gameplay mechanics and soft difficulty curve.The titular Blue Flamingo is a wingless aircraft operated by a nameless pilot competing against their fellow peers in a challenge to complete a course, populated by hostile combatants. Each pilot takes their own turn at tackling what the course has to offer, and retires once their craft sustains too much damage. That’s as far as The Blue Flamingo’s story goes, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing – it’s a simple story for a simple game.Indeed, simplicity is the heart and soul of The Blue Flamingo. The core gameplay itself is as simple as it can get for a shmup: you shoot enemies who primarily appear from the top and sides of the screen, all the while earning points with which to upgrade the Flamingo between stages. Enemies range from small craft that only shoot in a straight line, to much larger ones that bring up the rear and shoot in multiple directions at once. Most of the time you’ll find yourself relying on the Flamingo’s two guns, but when things get nasty you can fall back on the use of your bombs, which deliver a powerful, screen-clearing attack. The upgrades themselves come in two varieties: one which boosts the fire rate of the craft’s main guns and one that decreases the length of the cooldown period in between bomb uses. While upgrading improves one’s chances of survival, it also eats into their score, thus the player is forced to choose between spending their hard-earned points in hopes of ensuring a smoother ride during the next stage, or take the of risk foregoing any upgrades in favour of racking up a high score. Unlike a lot of other shmups The Blue Flamingo expects you to die, and die you will. There are no lives in this game and damage sustained is irreparable - that is to say: once you’re done, you’re done.This simple gameplay loop works wonderfully well. The ‘pick-up-and-play’ feel of the game is no doubt a major part of its appeal. There’s something about The Blue Flamingo that makes you want to have ‘just one more go’.The obvious downside to having such a straightforward take on the core gameplay experience is that some players will inevitably find themselves running into boredom relatively quickly. The Blue Flamingo doesn’t have the complexity or the longevity that others of its ilk possess, and as such those looking for something more than that described above are likely to stay for a few rounds before moving on to something more in-depth.One of The Blue Flamingo’s most distinguishing features is its use of real-life sources as graphical and audio assets – each and every one of the sprites seen in the game has been made using still images of hand-crafted, real-world models. The same goes for the environments and explosions. The end result is something that’s quite unlike anything previously seen in a shmup. The models look great when set against the environment backgrounds and it would be difficult not to argue that the explosions easily get the job done. If there’s one area that The Blue Flamingo does excel in, it’s in the graphics department. The real-world audio also adds a good touch to the game’s aesthetics, and is complemented by a charming musical score that fits quite nicely with the setting while feeling relaxing at the same time.In conclusion it can safely be said that The Blue Flamingo is a nice little game that can be enjoyed by almost anyone, whether they be a dedicated, hardcore fan of the shmup genre or an individual who has yet to immerse himself/herself in a computer game of any sort. Given the standard asking price of £3.99, it’s hard not to recommend The Blue Flamingo."

Not even the power ups or upgrades tempts me to get me going.Was bored within 15-30 minutes, and I really wanted to like this game."

All your awesome work doeasnt really look as good as I imagine it could be.- Would be nice to repair the ship with the money!- Would be also nice to buy new ships with a different gun setting!Please don't stop improving this game, the way you made it is awesome and it would be a pity to put it to the archive after under an hour of playtime because it starts to get boring :("

Fly around, shoot stuff and use a bomb occasionally.What caught my attention about this game was it's aesthetic. Music, sound design and hand made construction all come together to create a good-humored game.Despite having a basic gameplay, it will become progressivly more difficult and challenging as the ships shield degrades.This game gives me something to do while listening to a podcast, talk radio, or audio book."
