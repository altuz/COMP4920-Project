,Recommended,302060,10348382,"Posted: 4 June, 2014",all,Carrythxd,"A game made by SCS Software back in 2011.Some of the tasks in the game are really easy but some of them are a lot harder which is a good thing, there's no free roam atleast I didn't find it if it was there but I don't mind at all, the game is about completing tasks in various scenerios and I think it does exactly that!If you've played Euro Truck Simulator (ETS 1) the truck's handling and the enviroment's might be familiar to you which might help/might not help, atleast I found a lot of familar places while playing this game.Overall, I recommend the game. At the moment it's 7,99€ (on sale) but the actual price is only 9,99€ which isn't that bad so if you like trucking simulator's you should atleast give this one a try! :)Also in the game, there's 50 Tasks + 7 Basic Trucking Tasks (learning the basic vehicle manoeuvres) and 6 Bonus Trucking Tasks and there's also ingame achievements (Note: Ingame not Steam achievements). A total of 36 achievements.There's also 13 different truck models to choose from and a bunch of color choices!EDIT: SCS Software added some achievements to this game some time ago and if you have completed some of the achievements when the game didn't have Steam achievements, you will automatically unlock them.Also, after fully completing the game, including the Bonus Tasks, I can just say that it's an extremely hard game to complete, especially the last few missions."
,Recommended,302060,18626973,"Posted: 22 October, 2015",all,Drift King,"This is a great game for any Euro Truck Simulator (ETS) fans.  While ETS focuses on endurance driving and the freedom of trucking, Trucks and Trailers (T&T) focuses on the technical side of things.T&T is basically a collection of complicated trucking scenarios which are organized as mini-games.  It is very similar to Scania Truck Driving Simulator.  Challenges range from parking in small confines, navigating through tight corners, and mastering brake control.  The goal is to complete the task without causing damage to your vehicle.  This can be a lot of fun for truck enthusiasts, and there is little doubt that one’s trucking skills will improve.DifficultySCS decided to award Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals based on completion time.  A good driver should have no problems achieving the Silver medal for most challenges, but the Gold times require slightly rushed maneuvers that should never be attempted in real life.  Achieving Gold often requires many attempts, even for the best drivers.  It adds a nice challenge, but in real life, parking isn’t supposed to be a rushed process.Replay ValueDon’t expect much replay value on this game - unless you want to repeat the challenges over and over.  Despite this, the challenges will take you a fair amount of time (I am still working through them).  If you can get this on sale for less than 5.00 USD, it’s a fun little game to have.  A steering wheel or controller is recommended, but the default K&M controls are more than sufficient.GraphicsExpect this game’s graphics to be somewhere between ETS1 and ETS2.  It looks quite nice, and most low to medium spec PCs should have no problems running this.  You’ll probably get a higher FPS on this game compared to ETS2.For the features it has, and its price point, this is a great game."

It's not great, but passable.Cons:1) No manual. I got a 404 Not Found Error. I have no idea how to manual reverse.2) No customizable avatar. Why even have a portrait? Missed opportunity for collectable headgear. Gold medals are meaningless. Where is my CAT ballcap?!3) All trucks are COE and seem to handle the same. Missed opportunity.Final Score: 6/10. I picked this up while it was -80% off for only $2.39 and even then I'd probably only recommend it for die hard semi-tractor simulator enthusiasts."

Sure, there's no campaign, just a bunch of challenges, but it's fun, diverting and surprisingly engaging. It's also very satisfying; there were times I was absolutely sure I couldn't achieve what they were looking for, but with some lateral thinking, lots of shifting and a bit of ""crap, turned the wheel the wrong way"" I was able to complete the task and it's really rewarding. Definitely recommended."

,Recommended,302060,18073552,"Posted: 17 September, 2015",all,Stephen Stills,To begin I got this on discount. Trucks and trailers is seemingly a parking simulator through and through. You drive your semi for about 10 seconds before having to park it in various places with completely unrealistic parking hazards to avoid. That being said the game controls relatively well for being a small simulator game and looks half decent except for all the people of this world being struck with play-doh fever and being struck with rigormortis at the same time. Anyway getting off topic. The game is centered around parking and how well you can do it. And with decent controls it's a good timewaster but certainly not a full fledged game. Even though it is well done I don't believe there to be enough variety in the gameplay to illicit the 7 dollar pricetag. But that being said if you can nab it up for a dollar feel free to do so and have a laugh with your friends about another dumb truck game that could've easily been released as a small iOs title for the app store. Overall gameplay wise it leaves alot to be desired but is fun for a short period of time. 6/10 Decent title. If you would like to see some gameplay here is a link.https://youtu.be/uCBP5ycKZO0

I really like parking and precise maneuvering challenges, but timing for Gold is beyong ridiculous in most tasks. If you want to get Gold, you have to be reckless. No pro driver will drive in such a manner on public roads or parking lots. Time for Silver is more or less reasonable. This game can still be enjoyed if you aim at getting at least Silver. It is fairly easy to get Bronze because you need just to complete the task without crash to get it, regardless time. I give a thumb up to this game as a whole, but timing for challenges deserves thumb down."

If you want a challenge getting trailers around into some difficult parking places, then this is the game for you! I picked this up as part of the ET2 deluxe bundle, and have been enjoying playing it.Pros- variety of tasks.- able to choose several parking jobs if you get stuck (not limited to doing in exact order).- basic difficulty setting allows crashes to simply 'finish' level if you want to progress and come back later.- real sense of accomplishment when you do it right :)- decent physics engine.Cons- getting gold in all tasks is almost impossible (I've yet to get silver in all). If you NEED 100% achievements, you might find this one too hard.- some parking restraints are insane in pro.- in game radio turns off between levels, so generally more trouble that it's worth.- reversing mirrors don't work like ET2 (just go on popup mirror)Rating 7/10This game definitely wouldn't suit everyone, as the difficulty of all the tasks might end up on the high side. As an experienced ET2 player I started on pro, then quickly dropped the difficulty. Some parking locations seem just unfair (WHY would you park a trailer there??), but then the challenge can be quite satisfying. So if you want a game to test your backing skills, and pull some insane speeds to go for gold (or even silver), then definitely consider this game!"

Then it would be pretty much ideal, as you'd have full, proper controller support, ALL the trucks in both left & right hand drive and having a training system in place before you start booling about in a virtual truck!Still very playable, and no doubt will be fun to play with, but I think it should be linked to ETS2 without a shadow of a doubt."

This game is quite literally a truck-parking game where you're to move your truck and park it without hitting anything within a short time. You get graded on each level given how fast you can park your truck successfully; Gold if you can do it perfectly and fast enough to make a TAS-bot look impressed, Silver if you're a very experienced truck driver, and Bronze if you managed to do it safely without hitting anything. The instant you hit an obstacle, you won't get a medal for completion, but you will still get a mark saying you completed the level.One thing that stands out to me in this game is the replay feature. The game will save a replay of your successful times so you can watch them later. I utilized this to makethis 1 minute video,which I feel is good for demonstrating how the game plays.All in all, I would say that this game is for people who either want to better their truck parking skills, trailer-backing skills, want to play Euro Truck Simulator 2 without open roads, or a combination thereof. I personally enjoy it, as it focuses more on the technical aspects of parking your truck where Euro Truck Simulator focuses more on the long open-road driving."
