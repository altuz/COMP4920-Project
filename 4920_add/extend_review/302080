It's stupid because it doesn't accomodate any guns?No, as a matter of fact I'm glad that I bought this small game for my collection, just due to the fact that it's harder than you might expect at first glance.The graphics are more than adequate on full settings and the controls are smooth. Especially with a Joy-Pad. The busses are nicely done and the sound effects are okay.For this price ""Bus Driver"" delivers and not only passengers, but a nice and relaxing gaming experience for those who want to play something else besides shooters and strategy games."

What the heck were you thinking?  This game is what it sounds.  You drive.  You drive.  And you do missions.  No free-roaming(which kinda sucks) but missions.  If you want to drive a bus and pick up people, buy it.  If you want to shoot people and drive cars, get GTA4 or Saints Row 4."
,Recommended,302080,10350813,"Posted: 4 June, 2014",all,DJ Dostoevsky,"NOTE: Review based on digital retail release that I have completed.  Not the Steam version.A classic from SCS.The game is basically broken up into bite-sized missions where you take a specific bus type on a single route, picking up and dropping off passengers in a variety of locations and weather conditions. Early missions are usually under five minutes, steadily increasing over more advanced tiers. You're scored in real time along the way for obeying common traffic rules and docked points for upsetting your passengers (breaking too hard, running lights, etc.) along the way. At the end of your route your score is tallied and put in a high-score table.Presentation-wise, the graphics are dated (technically), but since it's a '07 title it takes next to nothing to crank all the settings up to 11, giving the game a clean, inviting look. It comes off as super charming, with a vivid and colorful pallet.  The constantly-updating UI overlays just scream classic SEGA sit-down arcade racer fun.  Overall, the game has a very unique look that gives it a lot of personality.  And because it's going for a more cartoonish look, I think it's aged FAR better visually than older SCS truck-sim titles of the same period.Finally, the game can be very challenging as you get further into the missions.  Obeying traffic laws while keeping your passengers happy and on time takes strict focus, which tests your meddle over longer 10 & 15+ minute routes.I think Bus Driver is a hidden gem from SCS that could be too easily overlooked based on the screenshots.  The game is a ton of fun, more arcade in nature than the simulation that SCS is known for.  Great for short-burst gaming or prolonged sessions.  It's got a nice price tag too.SCS has a free demo for it on thier website.http://www.scssoft.com/download_bus_driver_demo.phpPlay it with a 360 pad if you can.If you enjoyed ETS2 and are curious to try some SCS history, you can't go wrong with Bus Driver."

Very educational, but there are a few tweaks that need to be made.Pro's: Excellent driving simulation.Weather conditions.Detailed cities, and highways.Realisitic driving.Hours of gameplay.Cons: No speed limit and the police officers just sit there if you doing something wrong.Cars in front of you stop way too fast causing accidents to happen quite frequently.When driving in rain or snow there is barely any difference in your driving like it implies.Turning the bus is difficult in tight corners especially when there are cars beside you that turn sharply.Other than those issues I expect a lot out of this, and I'm sure the creators  haven't alreeady thought of these and will have more updates soon. Overall this is an amazing game and I would definitely recommend it."

It's simple, but quirky.Pros:-get rewarded for cutting people off - their velocity drops to 0 as soon as you jump in front of them no matter how fast you're going...this allows for some neat bobbing and weaving in and out of traffic-timer pressure. especially in the early missions, its difficult to drive safely and not be late to the stops...for whatever reason, twas a fun challenge to me-there are prisoner escort missions wherein you dont have to follow any traffic rules-after playing, i understand why such a high percentage of bus drivers are depressedCons:-every other vehicle can go from a speed of 0 to top speed instantly...this happens often at red lights-the penalty for not stopping at a redlight is 3x higher than hitting another vehicle head-on at full speed-sometimes the arrows on the street that indicate where to turn are misleading-if you arrive at a stop early, you have to sit and wait until youre on time-you don't lose points for being late, you simply get less of a bonus-after completing every mission...there's nothing. no ""congratulations"" screen, no credits, nothing...you're simply redirected to the main menu where you can comfortably regret the hours you wasted on this game"

Still it is one of the best driving sims I had ever played.Definite recommendation!10/10"
,Recommended,302080,10384644,"Posted: 7 June, 2014",all,WAWSH scoliono,"I bought the Euro Truck Simulator 2 pack for $19.99 when it was on sale, and I found this added to my library a few days after I got the pack. This game is very good to pass the time, and has decent graphics. However, it is not so much of a simluator as a game and there is no free-roam capability (but you can still drive anywhere while playing a mission). This is simular to Euro Truck Simulator 2 in the way that it is very picky; you get points docked for not turning on your blinkers while switching lanes, and the controls can sometimes be a challenge around corners. I recommend you should go through the controls before playing your first mission, because they don't tell you on their own. Another thing: You can't manipulate the camera. Most of the time, the camera is fine, but when driving in the neighboorhoods where there are a lot of trees, they get in the way of your view. The camera sometimes tries to move to help but usually doesn't make things better. The traffic lights also seem to be rigged; they don't stay green if you're approaching them. This annoys me a lot when I'm driving in the city, where there are 5-lane roads that are completely empty, and I am speeding down one towards a green light, which suddenly turns yellow (for what seems like a fraction of a second) and then red. 200 points lost for a traffic light offense. The AI of the other cars on the road isn't the greatest it could have been, too, and they don't seem to do anything when you honk at them. Despite its few disappointments, I still think this is an excellent title by SCS Software, and I think you should buy it."

,Recommended,302080,24953464,"Posted: 16 August, 2016",all,Whiteswart,"Bus Driver is obviously one of those ""Gray"" games, which can't take any real prolonged game interest, but not overall Bad to be disapproved.Visuals and controls are something in between of GTA 3 and 4 eras, game missions are all about taking some city bus route, making stops where it supposed to drop and pick up passengers, all the way ""driving safely and responsibly"". My cousin, who worked on a city bus for some time, described that game as ""dull, even if accurate in some details"".Were it up to me, I'd vouch for this game to be installed on some school computers, along with ""Car Mechanic"" and some other software of this kind.Although there, on Steam platform, along my friends and any other passers, exploring this store page by some random occasion... No, I don't recommend to buy Bus Driver. The amount of fun you'll get from playing it is considerably low. You'll not get any real skills of driving buses, except of the very basic ones, like some traffic rules, or knowing the facts of large inertia and turning radius...Could it be better? Maybe. With more adaptive and precise controls, more complex traffic system (including some violations from other drivers), more realistic camera views... to feel myself at real bus driver chair. So far... it is fair, but certainly not the best and complete experience on the given topic.Overall, my mark is 5/10 for Bus Driver as for the game, But - 7.5/10 as for educating programm for schools."

It's not for everyone, as the game is rather slow-paced and requires concentration rather than quick reflexes.The graphics are dated, but they look nice for what they are, and the game does run in full HD. The city (and suburbs) we're driving in for the missions is large and detailed. There are weather effects like snow, rain, storms, and I personally found that snow-covered roads do affect the driving slightly.The game runs flawlessly on my Win7 64-bit system with an AMD Radeon card.

76561198041887697,Recommended,302080,19487487,"Posted: 4 December, 2015",all,Blahsheep,"So I'm driving in the bus lane, late but not too late, no ""mistakes"" yet, light turns green, I'm going straight and the bus in the lane next to me decides to turn right into me which makes the whole bus scream in shock. Meanwhile I'm still trying to go straight and the bus is stuck to me like f**king gum.  I finally get to a stop and have to back up still stuck to the other bus, while still getting penalized for points for being in a collision.  I fnally got un-stuck and drove off while my customers are p*ssed and my points went out the window.Is this a game to fufill your desire to drive a bus?  Yes.  Is it a game that you can love AND hate?  YES.  It's a lot of fun, but it's old and has a lot of stupid things that can get annoying.You're always pressured to be the quickest way possible and with the crappy mechanics, it makes it harder.  I've been on time, and found out you have to wait until you reach the time before you can go, which is realistic, but then I end up being late for the last one for no reason.  The timing doesn't make sense.  ALSO, they perfectly timed the lights, traffic and everything else to make sure if you are the fastest, you will make all green lights... but if you are a few seconds behind, you end up being screwed and have to wait at a red light being honked at.In some missions, you literally have a free ride, you just drive straight and there's like 20 cars in the left lane, but the right lane is free so you can get the fastest time possibile.  So that takes you out of the immersion not having cars in front of you stopped at the lights and stuff.Also the AI stops INSTANTLY and goes to full speed from a stop INSTANTLY.The braking?  If you're using a keyboard you have to keep tapping brake and if you go a big too far... BAM -100 points and all your customers scream like you put your pants down to show your big hairy shlong.PROS:Okay graphics for its timeFun at timesFun to play in different conditionsMany different buses and missionsCONS:Drivers honk at you for stopping at red lightALWAYS pressured to be on timeBraking is annoyingCrappy AIWeird turning that really screws you upBad points system - 200 points for going through a red... 50 points for hitting somethingNo free roam (Or I couldn't find it)No cockpit view, only bumper view and third-personOverall this game is fun, but buy when it's on sale.

A flawed but fun ride with detailed penalties and that penalties makes you nervous all the time while driving. It enables you to  focus and concentrate for not doing mistakes so your hands will be locked to the game while riding the bus. And in that focus moment, when I hear passengers screaming, It scares me to death and I jump on my chair. Not the best simulation but you can get it on sale or in ETS pack.Pros:-Nice penalties-Lots of diffrent busses/missions-Swift controls-Nice scoring systemCons:-Outdated graphics-No cockpit camera-Red Light / Timer incompatibility-Lazy presentationOverall Score: 6.8/10"

It's a fun causal driving game. Compared to ETS/ATS and OMSI it's quite arcade, however that does not mean the game is easy (let alone not fun). It's a challenge to keep the passengers happy and arrive at the stops within time. However that's partly where the replay value lies. It's a game I do replay every now and then because other bus driving games don't offer the same variety as this one does, not without buying a whole bunch of expensive DLCs. Personally I see it as a nice complement to the more hardcore bus driving sims. It works well with a 360 controller. For me it runs perfectly on Windows 10, for others it doesn't."

I bought this in the sale for £1.39 and it was definitely worth the price. I like the funky music on the options screens as well.It took me a while to realise you are not supposed to go through red lights and that you have to indicate when you leave a bus stop, but then I am no driver and have also played far too much Grand Theft Auto.

The controls are really heavy, making the busses quite difficult to drive. It turns out that this is not actually a simulation, and is more like an arcade game, putting you in a random bus to do a random task not related to anything else in the game.And above all that, the scoring system makes no sense. Accidentally go a little to far when pulling up to a stop? -100 points. Get into a head on collision with a car at 50 mph? -100 points. How not braking quite soon enough and barrelling full speed into a car are the same degree of evil I'll never know, but what I do know is that unless you're getting the ETS 2 Deluxe Bundle (which this is included in), this game is a waste of time and money."

Also, SCS' trucking games are different too, because between cities, they don't have that many rules to keep you tied. Bus Simulator feels more restricted, because you play in an urban area.

Should I really cross over three lanes of traffic so I can make that left turn I didn't know I needed to make until the last minute?

First of all the camera angle of this game is AWFUL!! when you turn a bus, the camera angle doesn't follow the bus, so you could see the side of the bus when you're turning. Also, the traffic light is a troll. the traffic light literally turn red as you're  about 150m away to enter the crossing. and there no way you can use the brake to stop in time. speaking of which, Why does this game limit you're using the brake, in other SCS game, non of them have brake meter, which limit you how hard you can brake, and it's also stupid because with the brake meter that only allow you to brake at a certain point, it takes forever to stop the bus. and it feel like some of the bus braking is so unrealistic. The speed of the bus is also unrealistic. First of all how could a city bus can drive 40MPH on a street road, while when the tour bus go on the highway it can only go as fast as 55MPH, which most tour bus can go 60 or even 70 MPH on city Highway. The map is pretty big, but I don't get why one part of the map is like summer weather like and the other part where the airport is fill with snow? The bus are pretty cool, the weather is somewhat realistic. The AI is better than euro truck simulator 2. but the graphic look pretty outdated. so if you want to buy a REAL Bus simulator game try OSMI, or bus simulator 2012, that has better graphic and more realism than this game"

It lacks any flair or fancy, has no real incentives for the player to actually keep playing, beyond holding off more difficult levels until a few levels from easier tiers are completed, and it's virtually impossible to play without a controller (You can get along fine with just WASD, but good luck braking at red lights/bus stops without being penalised for braking too hard).That being said, it's oddly alright to just waste time and chill in? As a game I didn't even know I had in my steam library until a few weeks ago, it's decent enough. Don't pay full price for it, though. I'm recommending this for anyone who is unsure of playing it after discovering they own it, or for anyone considering purchasing a bundle including this game, or purchasing this game alone when heavily discounted.To sum it up in bullet points:+ Decent difficulty curve+ Has some unexpected variations on some levels+ One of the very few driving sim games I've played that actually penalises you for not indicating before switching lanes- You essentially -need- a gamepad with pressure sensitivity to play, as keyboard controls mean avoiding braking too hard is near impossible- AI vehicles in-game go between 0 and full-speed instantly, making negotiating red lights difficult if there's anyone in front in your lane- On some levels, the spawn point is off the side of the road, and you must drive across oncoming traffic to head in the right direction. The game seems unaware that it has imposed this upon you, and will penalise you for driving on the wrong side of the road as you cross over."

The graphics, bearing in mind the age of the game, are excellent. Steering is OK, and a LOT better than the steering in Bus Simulator 2012, although not as good as the steering in OMSI 2. You get a good range of scenarios, and passing them helps to unlock higher-level ones. The scenarios are nice and varied, with some set in the city, some in the suburbs and some out in the country. The weather in the scenarios is also highly varied. You get to drive in snow, rain, wind and of course bright sunshine. So you get a good range of driving experiences.One thing the game lacks is a bus interior. You only get two camera views: behind the bus from the outside or perched on the front windscreen. So you can't see your steering wheel, dashboard and so on. Another gripe I have is that the traffic lights are kind of hard to see and also seem to have very short sequences.This is not a sophisticated simulator like OMSI 2 or the SCS flagship Euro Truck Simulator 2. It is also not as sophisticated as Bus Simulator 2012, but is far more functional than the latter and thus more enjoyable to play. Definitely a very good early offering from SCS. I look forward to trying out their Euro Coach Simulator at some stage in the future!"

Reading the reviews at that time I still could not believe it was a serious game. I was under the impression it would just be a game where you could screw over passengers and what not. Hours later I was not busy trying to cause accidents but I was busy trying to be a responsible bus driver. This game became very serious.I really enjoy this game. Driving on the highway has never been this calming. You just have to put on some background music and off you go! This game even got me to use blinkers! I have never bothered in any game with blinkers but in this game I really do try my best to keep to the rules of the road.Ofcourse no game is without a flaw or two and the same goes for bus driver. My biggest annoyance with this game is the timer. I understand that, as a bus driver, you need to be on time at the next stop. However, especially in later levels, this is almost impossible to do. Even if you were to drive through red lights (point deduction of 200) you will not make it. I suppose thats realistic as most of the time bus drivers are not in time but seeing as how it does count up at the end of the level I feel that that could have been made a little better. Not to mention that no matter which bus I drive there is an automatic speed limit on it. There are other busses in the same level that are going faster then I am.All in all it's a nice game to play. If you have some money to spare and you would like a nice calming game and ignore the flaws that I mentioned then get this game. :)"

(1 or 2)This is a cute game. If you have a controller, you girlfriend can spend lots of time playing this game :)There is not much bugs. Physics are weird. Environment is just right for this kind of small game (do not expect much). There are no music. Driving a bus is fun. There are different tiers of buses, some are faster i think, and busses have different lines. There are traffic rules like blinker faults or pssing through red light. But here isn't anything else to do in the game. So it may become boring.Recommended ONLY IF YOU LIKE SIMPLE GAMES. Because there is a professional alternative called Euro Truck Simulator."

I think it's not great if you play it with keyboard, but it will work pretty good with any PC wheel. Yes, I said that. I know it's indie game, but it supports PC wheels better than some of the bigger titles.This game is made by those guys who have created Euro Truck Simulator, American Truck Simulator and a lot other truck simulator games, so it should say something.But it can be annoying when trying to steer very hard corners with huge buses."

,Recommended,302080,30520060,Posted: 14 March,all,orange,"If you want a bus simulator, you should play OMSI. If you just want to take a break and have some fun, Bus Driver is a better choice. The game itself is not so addictive when you have finished the integrated levels and there's no way for customizations, but there are lots of resources on the web which can bring more fun, like vehicles, maps, vehicle performance, etc. It's a pity the game does not provide Workshop feature maybe because it's an old game and developers don't want to spend extra time on it. Anyway, if you like buses, this game is not a bad choice.Rating: 7/10"

Their names are very random, as for whatever reason, SCS Software has named bus stops as towns in Greater London, and as a Londoner, it is a negative, as they look nothing like their real life counterpart. For instance, a bus route has Beckton a bus stop away from Eltham which realistically, they are on either side of the River ThamesMost bus routes are short or are long distance with routes having only 5 stops or long distances with no stops. Many buses have similar routes as there are 5 routes that operate around the Grove Park and Hounslow/ Ewell area.You can only operate a bus route in one direction, with no variation of passengers, weather or traffic, making each playthrough of a bus route the same.The game includes 5 different buses with two buses having a different colour scheme. They are, except for the double decker, American buses, so you'll be driving in the right side od the road. They look ok, but there isn't a cab view or the ability of exit the bus or free roam, so the game is very linear. There are also two coaches, school bus and a prison bus.The game was originally released in 2007 with 5 tiers. There are 6 routes for each tier, making this Bus Driver include 36 routes. You could fly through the game in less than an hour, as to pass a teir, 4 routes need to be completed.Graphically, there has been alot of backlash and nowadays, it looks quite poor, but for 2007, it's good.The game overall is very basic, geographically incorrect and very short. I'd still recommend it as it was my first bus simulatior almost 10 years ago and is good for beginners and value.6/10 Only due to its easy accessibility for beginners."

The computer I had when I was a kid had the demo for this game and I remeber replaying it over and over again. 10 years later I bought the full version and it is still fun. Sure it's a pretty simple game but the game is really challenging to get right and if you can get it on sale you won't be dissapointed. The problems I have with this game are, the levels are quite short and a little repetitive, and the 3rd person camera is a little akward to see. But those are small problems and I highly recommend this game if you have a couple of bucks lying around."

But it did not age very well. There are many way better bus driving simulators around these days, such asBus Simulator 16andBus Simulator 2012. However, these more recently published games are much more complicated to control than this game, Bus Driver. So if you like simplicity and would just like to drive around in some (pretty big, actually) nice scenery and city without too much things to worry about, this is the game for you. Otherwise, I'd recommend getting a more recent bus simulator game."
