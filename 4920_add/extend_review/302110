76561198141404871,Recommended,302110,17840423,"Posted: 1 September, 2015",all,joan4003,"For some HO gamers this game will be entertaining and enticing, for others it will be annoying and dumb.  Once the rather contrived supernatural aspects are accepted even the ""weirdness"" that occurs is amenable.The Story:  Vera receives a cryptic phone call from her estranged younger twin Arthur asking/begging her to come back to their childhood home, Pilgrim's Hook, a remote ex-whaling island village off Nantucket, Massachuesetts (USA).  (This fictional place would be off the coast of Boston, Cape Cod, or Martha's Vintage in Massachusetts for trivia lovers.)  By the time she gets there her brother is missing and she must find him.  Relatively typical storyline, except for the fact she finds him by chapter two.  Meanwhile, an evil lurking Cthulhu-like octopus starts talking to Vera through water puddles and flat reflective surfaces.  Creepy, and just exactly why does it want Vera?  This is actual storyline: the mystery of island and why it is there.  The evil denizen of the deep is left rather open to interpretation, however, its motives are not. It clearly states them.  However, why it considered Vera to be a good candidate is well ... simply a poor choice of its part.The gameplay:  This is where the gamer will love or hate the game.   If a straight forward linear hunt, search and find is your thing, then this game is not it.  The gameplay is ""open world"".  What I mean by this is the gamer can go anyway, look, hunt, search, find objects, and do puzzles in no given order.  What can be done is limited to the clues given, items found and objects available in the inventory.  This will cause ""confusion"" for linear thinkers, and complaints from those who dislike ""wandering"".  (There is a built in walkthrough that is set up in a linear progression and a fast travel map.)  The game ""bottle necks"" at certain points and the player can not progress until all objects needed to be found are found and the tasks needed to be done are completed.  (Personally I consider these points to be self checks, if I cannot proceed I missed something somewhere.)Puzzles: There are two types of HOs.  1) Straight forward HO scenes with at least one cleverly hidden object. (Not the type that makes one say ""jerks"" but the type that make one say ""oh there it is, wow how did I miss that""  2) Find x amount of objects.  Usually 3 different objects of different amounts.There is a variety of other puzzle types some harder then others, one requires a lot of patience and one ultra classic I have not seen in years.  (Some of those oldies will stump today's audience and this one will probably stump some players.)There are two sets of Hidden Finds: Castor's Collection (fading in and out sea life) found throughout the main storyline, and the Whale's Bones, only available after finishing the bonus chapter.Overall: Not a deep storyline and one that leaves a lot of room for intrepretation and unanswered questions if one thinks about it too much.  ""Open world"" game style.  A variety of puzzles (at least one ultra classic) and HO scenes.  This a relatively short game, too, compared to more recent games.One last thing: Achievements.  All in-game achievements can be achieved in a single playthrough and some achievements are quite different from the usual achievement fare.  If steam achievements and trading cards is the only reason you play then do not play this game, this game has neither.  However, if you play HOs for the sheer joy of playing a decent story with decent HO scenes and puzzles then play this game."

And Pilgrim's Hook turned out to be fine for that - the puzzles aren't trivial, but nothing that'll really stump you either. Artwork is well done and atmospheric. The plot is thin, as is the logic behind many of the ""adventure"" components of the game, but neither were so bad as to actually put me off the game.If you're looking for a diverting, Cthulhu-esque adventure romp that keeps you entertained for 4-5 hours, Pilgrim's Hook is worth picking up (though probably not at full price.)"

The game's mechanism is quite descent, find hidden objects, solve puzzles, linear story line.

Previous game in this series: LivingstonGame Visual/AudioThere isn't much can be said about the game's visuals asides from that they're amazingly well done. Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. The visual and audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu.GameplayThere are three different game difficulty modes to choose from: Casual, Expert and Hardcore.There are fifteen different achievements can be earned during gameplay. Some of these achievements do have certain requirements before they can be unlocked.There is a notebook holds all story events that had happened in the game.There is an objective panel inside the notebook. Click on the tab it will bring up the objective panel.The interactive map allows the player to fast travel between each location quickly. It also indicates there are tasks that needs to be done at certain locations. The map can be accessed through the notebook and outside of it. Please note that the map isn't given immediately when the game started.Most of the hidden object scenes consists of find ""x"" amount of an item and traditional word list. Some of them do require little or no interaction.Most of the game's puzzles are rather easy to solve without much difficulty. For most of these puzzles there's a reset button. However, there's definitely a skip button, for all of the puzzles. These two features are only present in ""Casual"" game difficulty mode.There are twenty-five collectible sea creatures. They're scattered throughout the entire game.Since this is a collector's edition game, there's a bonus chapter, but it can be unlocked only after the main story of the game's completed. The bonus chapter is the pre-sequel to the main story.There's a built-in strategy guide for the game. It can be access anytime during gameplay.MiscellaneousIn the Bonus Content section: nine concept art; six wallpapers; collectibles: whale bones and sea creatures; Arthur's Journal; Achievements and Bonus Chapter.[Please note that Arthur's Journal and Whale Bones sections can't be accessed right away.]Final thoughts, I definitely enjoying playing this game all the way through to the end. However, there's one thing that would make traveling less tedious is having a map that fast travel ability. As for the replay value I would say is low. I would recommend this game but not at the full price.http://store.steampowered.com/app/302110"

It may be unoriginal, but it is also a solid hidden object puzzle title.Long version:Small Town Terrors 2 is the kind of hidden object game that tries to remain in the genre’s comfort zone, which works as much to its advantage as against it.The story offers little surprises: while searching for a loved one you find yourself in a small town haunted by something evil, which of course you promptly destroy before the end credits. There is next to no supporting cast, and the voice acting is kind of a hit and miss.Same goes for the puzzles: we don’t meet a single one that wasn’t seen before, but they offer a large variety and a good difficulty curve– although the hidden object scenes tend to rely on the ‘find x amount of said object’ gimmick. The only really conspicuous flaw is the usual dumb adventurer syndrome, where you instantly throw away a useful object even if you would need it three scenes later.Despite these small issues Pilgrim’s Hook is still a good pick that won’t really disappoint any hidden object game fans."

I love hidden object games but this is not good, the only valuable thing is the hidden object part which are well made, but all the rest... The story would like to be a Lovecraft like story but is a real mess, it has no logic and the final is really ridicolous, sometimes is good, but really only sometimes. The map do not include all the locations but they are summed up in big spot in the map. So you can have 10 locations in the same spot and all the region is blinking so you have no idea in which location you have to do something, and as there is no hint in where the next action will take place, you will be forced to try and try over and over to run through location and try objects. The enigmas part is the worst, they have no logic, no clue, nothing, so you will need to hit skip a lot."

The atmosphere is the best part: following your brother, you come into a little island that was disturbing when you lived on it and has now gone to hell.  You pick your way through the town, coming across people whose lives have been hit by what is going on, threatened by an unknowable enemy.The story alternately explains just enough and not enough. It's not Lovecraftian in the sense of a huge impersonal universe, but its nods and homages are well done and its plot stays consistent throughout.I keep buying games from this developer hoping for another like this."

76561198025753722,Recommended,302110,29084032,Posted: 7 January,all,Kill It With Light,"SURPRISINGLY DECENT!Plot was considerably less terrible than others in the genre; even when things were very obviously Super Weird it did make sense why the MC didn't turn tail and run/call the cops/etc!  Not a particularly inventive plot, but, well.  HoGs, noooot known for their inventiveness.Hidden object scenes were mostly very good - difficult, but in the well-hidden way, not the are you SERIOUS? way.  One annoyance, though - you're prompted for a dragon in one scene, and there's both a Chinese-style and a Western-style dragon (it's asking for the Western one).Some of the gather-things-to-solve-puzzles were a little contrived (why can't you pick up a candle with your hands? You just HAD a hammer why do you need to go find a new one?  Why can't you pop balloons with your knife?), but mostly made sense.Also, in an amazing departure from genre standards:MC straight up murders a guy.  Premeditated cold blooded murder.  Amazing!  A little scary, what do you even do for a job Vera, but given that the genre tends to go out of its way to AVOID having the MC killing anyone - even in the middle of a fight - and instead come up with super weird magical workarounds, it was also incredibly awesome.  :DProbably 9/10 for HoG standards!"

It is that good!!!Great storyline, good graphics, interesting characters and objects that are not always really simple to figure out what they are used for along with lots of hidden objects spots (non-repetative).  When unused objects start to fill up my inventory and I am still feeling really interested, that is a good thing!I just started this today and it is on the same level with House of 1,000 Doors, my all time favorite.  I like to keep these reviews simple and too the point.  I play my HOGs on EXPERT only and this one doesn't fail to impress.My only advice is if you love really tricky puzzles, this game is not full of them.  The puzzles are good, but not difficult, which is fine by me, but if you are a puzzle lover you may find this aspect dissapointing."

But, since there's no middle-of-the-road option, I've got to recommend it.   However, while here writing this review, I noticed the list price for the game:  just about $15.  No.  Just no.  I got 5.3 hours of tolerable gameplay out of it (4.6 hours in the main game and 0.7 hours in the bonus chapter).  Under no circumstances is that worth $15.  I happened to have bought the game in the 8-item Sinister Bundle for a total of about $8 (call it a dollar a game).  Now, that's worth it.There's nothing special about the game.  The graphics, puzzles, Hidden Object Games (HOGs), and voice acting are all acceptable for the genre.  Personally, I found the gameplay to be just a bit more difficult to get through than in other similar games.  One thing that did strike me is that near the end, the logic of the gameplay seems to fall apart:  I had to resort to the Strategy Guide just to figure out WHAT I was supposed to be doing (not necessarily HOW).  Also, the game is awfully weak in explaining what the bad guy is trying to do.  At the end of the bonus chapter, it explains it's the standard ""Pinky and the Brain"" ""try to take over the world"" thing.  But, if I've got the chronology right, the bad guy spent about two centuries tormenting a handful of people until his sphere of influence was reduced to about 5 people and an isolated town.  Pretty weak."

I played the games in order of listing in the bundle, and the games seemed to get less impressive as they went on (though the House of 1000 Doors games are both better than the weird Castle game). It got to the point where I just stopped playing them when I got to Price for Our Sins, and didn't even bother playing this game.I made a huge mistake. I randomly decided to try this game out because I was bored, and found it was just as good, if not better, than every other game of the bundle. The puzzles are challenging, the story is very good, and it honestly scared the crap out of me.tl:dr version: If you love point & click games and can only get one from this bundle, buy this one and stay as far away as you can from Shadows: Price for Our Sins."

I turned it on one day when I had nothing better to do, and found myself hooked (that was not meant to be a pun, I'm so sorry). I found the story to be fun, and the puzzles to be engaging but not too difficult. The artwork was lovely, though my only complaint on that front is that the talking animations looked a little stilted. My only other issues are that I wish the achievements were linked to steam, and sometimes the placement of an item was very sensitive to a select few pixels. For instance, I spent about a half hour furiously trying to use a pry bar on a loose board, until I finally found the right area of pixels.Overall, I find it very fun, but I wouldn't recommend spending $15 on it. It can be completed in a few short hours."
