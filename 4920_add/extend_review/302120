A storyline, a mixture of hidden object scenes and thinking games. Once I figured out how to use the map...(Silly me) it went a lot faster then having to click back all the time.Not everything is obvious and I had to peek at a few walk throughs to figure one or two things out, but over all it was a good time waster. My son enjoyed watching me play it and helped me as well.I will be buying other titles of this as well. I really enjoyed it."

(I have played all 4 games in the series, in order.)  It is stand alone, as is, but the series storyline might confuse a player as the game briefly refers to previous game adventures in single ""throw away/reveal"" lines depending on how much of the series storyline is known.The story: The Palm of Zoroaster, a cursed orb, has been destroying things, people and quite possibly civilizations (or at least, select parts of it) for centuries.  Your job is to destroy the orb.  (No spoilers because there are some if one has been following the series storyline.)  Learn the orb's history, witness its destruction, and of course discover how to destroy it and gather the means to do so.The game is set up with an introduction/tutorial, four adventure chapters, and the final conclusive chaper.  I rather like this setup which is different then other HOs with a much more linear storyline.  What changed in this game from the first game (Family Secrets) is the player does not get to choose which adventure to embark on first.  For this game and storyline purposes it is perfect though.Hidden object scenes, mixed with some head scratching puzzles and the usual standard puzzles, plus some point and click and a chapter by chapter accumulate and use inventory.  Nothing too hard or tear your hair out challenging.  Game comes with a walkthrough the player can access if they get stuck in game or on a puzzle.  Every puzzle has a skip option and sparkles on needed objects or mini puzzle scene.  Unless playing in Hard mode.  There are three game modes available, in-game achievements, wall papers and a bonus chapter.Warning: If you are hunting for those elusive extra ""hidden/ghost/shape shifting"" objects make sure you have them all before leaving the introduction or adventure chapter because you cannot go back once the chapter is finished. (Except in a new game).Opinion: I like the series, therefore I like each game.  The overall concept is interesting and lends itself to innumberable further games.  The only thing I did not like in this game was the end.  I was expecting a much longer cut scene.  It ended and I thought ""Wait, that is it.""  The adventure ended, the game ended, but the end felt truncated.  Ah well the bonus chapter made up for the abrupt conclusion."

It's up to you to travel through dimensions again to save everyone and particularly Gabriel, the protector of it.This game is the sequel to House of 1,000 Doors: Family Secrets and you'll find some familiar characters, if not everyone from the first game. The plot is also a good written. You're going from China to the jungle, which means many exotic backgrounds for someone who is used to a western city.The gameplay is the usual one: click on items that you'll need in another scene, solve puzzles, find hidden objects in specific areas, etc.. I found everything well-balanced. Also, you have close-up views in these hidden objects scenes and some objects you can move as they're also hiding items to find.But what made me love the game, though I've hinted it earlier, is probably the journey through 4 different worlds and meet people that knew about Gabriel - I found it nice that the guy has a background, though it's breaking the charm around this mysterious man (but the more is known in the bonus chapter). And the scenes are really well drawed. You're really transported into other worlds.The soundtrack is also nice but didn't change from the previous game.So if you're a fan of HOG, you have to own this game. Besides, there are trading cards with nice emoticons and backgrounds."
,Recommended,302120,12799877,"Posted: 5 November, 2014",all,Usagi,"It’s calling out to you, the fabled House of 1,000 Doors, a place of magic and legend that none can agree even exist.Kate Reed returns once moreto these haunted halls and once again finds herself embroiled in the lives of the residents who live there. Can she help lift the curse and bring about peace again? Can she help Gabriel in his time of need? And will she stay in the house this time? Play on to find out.If you haven’t played the first installment in this series fear not, you can play this game without any prior knowledge. Though some of the same characters return and it’s the same setting, the story is completely different. InHouse of 1,000 Doors: The Palm of Zoroasterthe main character Kate has to travel between four different worlds piecing together the mystery of a cursed gem and collecting crystal skulls that are used to seal its evil away.The house itself doesn’t play a huge part in the gamebecause of this and you run into fewer characters this time than in the first title. There are still ghosts that need your help, however, again, the previous installment in this title offered more compelling stories.. The story itself is very straightforward: visit the different worlds and help the people, then stop the Palm of Zoroaster, something that has no name until the last few moments of the game.Sadly,the game has repeated a flaw that I found in the first game; the best part of the story comes in the bonus chapteras the main game ends very abruptly. A bonus chapter should add on the story, not actually finishing telling the story. The addition helps make the game feel more complete as you help the house’s caretaker Gabriel and learn more about this past. However, like the first title, Gabriel still wants Kate to stay in the house and even by the end of the bonus chapter there is no confirmation if she agrees or not. The story feels a bit disjointed and has lost a lot of the mysterious charm the first title had. Kate expresses no reason for even returning to the house and the mystical cursed fireball that seem to be causing trouble rarely does much of anything besides float around giving no sense of urgency to the mission of the game.There isn’t much sense of anything in the game and Kate expresses nothing, while the voice acting in the first title wasn’t perfect it would seem that the quality has gone down with this one. EspeciallyKate who doesn’t seem interested in anything. She is a dry and empty vessel character for the player to put their shoes into, despite having a backstory. There is also quite a bit of recycled music from the first game, though some new background melodies have been added as well. The game is saved by good gameplay and artwork, all of the hidden object scenes are well done and the game also adds more puzzles this time as well. The worlds you visit are brought to life with vibrant colors and the game even added a map to help with the amount of backtracking done.I know I said you don’t have to play the first House of 1,000 Doors to enjoy this title but I still highly recommend it, I personally found it better than this installment. I do also recommend playing this one as well story issues aside it’s a lot of fun to play and has about a good four hours length to it. Puzzles are still not too difficult and the hidden object scenes don’t repeat themselves as much, you can also collect beyond objects for fun. No achievements but trading cards for those who enjoy badges and goodies,this game should be in your libraryif you’re into the hidden object genre.Lunar Productions"

The titular house serves only as a nexus between the four distinct paintings/levels, all featuring their own new ghost story that eventually form a larger plot. What that plot is can be a good question though, since the game lacks an ending, it just stops after the last artefact. And no, the bonus chapter won’t help either, although it reveals a few interesting secrets on its own.The difficulty has decreased substantially since the first game, and there is a much larger focus on hidden object scenes. The progression is more straightforward, but not linear, giving you a greater sense of pace despite the fairly long gameplay."

,Recommended,302120,12176206,"Posted: 21 September, 2014",all,Mad Scientist,"After playing through House of 1000 Doors - Family Secrets, I was a little concerned about how enjoyable this game was going to be.  (I wasn't even sure if I was playing them in the proper order, chronologically.)  However, this worked out perfectly.Almost all the Interface annoyances I had with the first game were resolved by UI changes in this sequel.  (i.e. MAP feature made it feel less like I was constantly backtracking.  I always knew where I needed to go next, even if I wasn't always sure what I was supposed to be doing when I got there.)  Plus, I played on Casual setting this time around so I was fighting less with trying to figure out where the layered hotspots were (hidden object puzzles), and could just focus on the game itself.This still isn't my favorite Hidden Objects method, however, considering the massive improvements since the last game, I'm going to give it a ""perfect"" score anyway.  I hope they make more products (especially in the Collectors Edition format).  I plan on buying more in this series.Final Score:  5/5 (Partially because of Extra Chapter, & Bundled Strategy Guide, etc in Collectors Edition format)I'm also not complaining that all the Steam Cards generate several dollars each when I resell them, currently.  ;)"

,Recommended,302120,13884008,"Posted: 7 January, 2015",all,Coreplant,"I definitely reccomend this sequel to 1000 Doors: Family Secrets.  What was already enjoyable gameplay gets a big boost from the new map system - not just tracking where you've been, but giving a quite hint of where you need to go next, and cutting the backtracking with the new travel system through the map. A decently interesting plot, good quality graphics, and tastefully done CG - something I can definitely applaud  is their very careful use of it. Well worth the price.If I have to quibble, I have just one - the voice acting, while excellently recorded, gets a little wooden and bogged down in the middle of the game, and three of the voices quite simply sound like the same guy putting on different accents. Which is not necessarily bad in and of itself, but whoever it is can't really emote that well. Please take this with a bit of salt, as I do have some hearing loss."

It's thin on story compared to the aforementioned title - you basically just go through a series of slightly exotic ""other worlds"" to enable the finale - and the ending holds a significance which its scant content fails to live up to, but for the right price it's a good buy for genre fans."

76561198036338106,Recommended,302120,13894150,"Posted: 8 January, 2015",all,smelliga,"This game is the sequel to ""House of 1000 Doors: Family Secrets.""  You don't necessarily need to play through that one first to understand this one, but I would highly recommend it.The gameplay is similar to its predecessor, and involves:1. Item-based puzzles (find objects, then use them to solve tasks).Compared to the first game, ""Palm of Zoroaster"" does a much better job of streamlining your puzzle solution objects.  It drastically reduced the rate of item redundancy, and it also paced the items properly, so that most of the time you are only lugging around things that are germane to the puzzles at hand.2. Traditional hidden object screens.  As with ""Family Secrets,"" these take the form of ""junk with no coherent theme, scattered across a location."" (Seriously, why are there always children's toys mixed in with priceless antiques and vegetables?)  The puzzles were a good challenge level, incorporating two-part objects (i.e. pitcher + glass = ""glass of water""), cached objects (stowed in drawers or chests), and click-to-zoom areas.  The objects were well drawn, well delineated, and clearly labeled.3. Bonus hidden ""beyond"" objects that appear in the background art and slowly morph back and forth between two different images. There are 46 total to find in the main game (approximately one per screen, including some detail screens).  There is no incentive to collect these other than personal pride, and the locations are included in the game's built-in comprehensive strategy guide.4. A handful of easy mini-games (rotating discs, swapping tiles, matching, etc.) that unlock new objects or open new paths.  I liked all the mini-games in the main mission, but I actually skipped one in the bonus content because it was just too tedious (and I pride myself on never skipping anything in a casual game).The music and character designs are pretty much recycled from the first game, which makes sense, but all of the background art and puzzles are new.I liked the story of this game better.  It was more coherent, and the plot was a bit less dark, centering around the history of a single cursed object instead of around cursed objects + unfortunate accidents + witchcraft + mediums and psy powers + your maligned grandmother.  I also thought the locations were more interesting (even though they were stereotypical, rather than accurate, representations of those places).One nit-picky thing that bothered me was the tone of the portals.  In the first game it was clear that the portals led to a dream-like world where ghosts were trapped in the moment of their tragedy.  In this game I was unsure at first whether I was in a dream world created by the house, whether I was in the actual past, or whether I was in the present day.  This was mostly due to the letters and journal entries, but there was also an odd mash-up of anachronistic items in each location.  The confusion didn't really affect my overall understanding of the plot or my ultimate enjoyment of the game, but it did momentarily break the immersive experience.The voice-acting was also bothersome.Some things this game did that the first game didn't:- There is now a map that not only shows you where you have actions available, but allows you to instantly teleport to any screen in the game.  This is a great feature to eliminate backtracking, or to give you a nudge in the right direction if you are stuck.- They added an ""expert"" difficulty that has a slower hint recharge rate and eliminates the ""interactive area"" sparkles.- They reused HOGs from the main game in the bonus content. (Booooo. Lazy.)Overall, I enjoyed the art, the story, and the adventure game elements better than ""Family Secrets,"" and I liked the new map feature, but the HOG puzzles and mini-games weren't quite as solid, and the bonus content felt rushed and superfluous.I would rate the game a 7.5/10"

The story is a bit weaker than the norm for the genre, but otherwise, t's pretty much standard fare for a HOG:  good graphics, fun puzzles, acceptable voice acting.  The $10 list price is a tad high for it's length, so I'd wait for a sale to buy it or get it in a bundle (the Sinister Stories Bundle is how I got it).  Still, I'm recommending it."

First, I find ""Family Secrets"" to be the superior title and suggest playing that game first.* House of 1000 Doors: The Palm of Zoroaster is pretty much the same exact game as Family Secrets, but easier in my opinion. Some of the puzzles just seems to pad out its shorter length and some just seem uninspired. My biggest gripe with Plam of Zoroaster is that they used the same music and some of the same exact models and drawings from Family Secrets! I enjoyed the music and the artwork, but you really couldn't have added some new tracks and lessened the amount of reused artwork? Overall, if you liked family secrets then you won't really go wrong with Palm of Zoroaster, but expect a very simliar experience that doesn't feel as satisfying.
