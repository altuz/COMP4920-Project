During his trials he is often contacted by the antagonist: an excellently written character, who constantly balances on the brink of being comically over the top, but manages to stay threatening throughout the story– including one of the best bonus chapters (with an incredibly clever twist) in hidden object game history.Although most of the game is spent by running around in the mansion, the monotony is often broken by some easy puzzles and a few very good hidden object scenes. And the best thing is that most of them have an actual reason within the storyline to be there, creating a more immersive atmosphere.If you like thrillers, Dorian Gray Syndrome is definitely a good choice for you, casual genre or not. The great writing and level design make it one of the most enjoyable games of its kind."

Actually, it would be demeaning to call it only a hidden object game. In-depth psychosis depicted with great atmosphere and a neatly arranged storyline. Our serial killer 'Oscar' - nice reference to Oscar Wilde, creator of Dorian Gray - is worth meeting. The methods and artistic demeanor of our host/psychopath makes him a character to remember. I'd like to add that the art work is well above the ordinary expected from the HOG genre. Besides being a well arranged adventure, including some well thought puzzles and a wide range of areas to explore, a bonus chapter awaits at the end, for an epilogue. I warn you though; there is no happy ending in Oscar's domain!"

But they also weren't just the ""same old, same old"" puzzles that are in other HOGs.This felt longer than other HOGs I've played through a combination of factors.  Definitely worth the money!The voice acting for the villain was very good, though Oscar could be a little long-winded at times.  And I didn't really like ""my"" reactions.  Maybe if I were coming across the ""artwork"" and trying to save my girlfriend from this guy, my reactions would be similar, but I don't know."

That doesn't mean that there is something to do there yet though.On top of that it has no fast travel which makes you run around in circles.The puzzles are crap as well.For instance a ""mirror this image"" which consists of 60 small parts or so. Boring.Or a picture puzzle with 10x10 tiles that are pretty small so it's hard to make out anything.The story itself wouldn't be so bad but the gameplay is just fubar."

,Recommended,302130,14991312,"Posted: 21 March, 2015",all,shiaakuma,"Very well-done game with a combination of point-and-click adventure aspects and hidden object/puzzles.  Compared to some, this game focuses more on the puzzles and less on HO scenes.The story was engagingly creepy and while not entirely original, was entertaining.  The back story was fairly formulaic but as it's fed to the player in small bits, via diary entries mostly, the somewhat predictable history of the villain did not detract from the story.  What helped this is that the game didn't bonk you in the head with information about the villain; to some extent you have to imagine the events leading up to the events of the game and to me, at least, that makes it more mysterious and creepy.  The villain manages to be both over-the-top psycho and creepy.  It's a combination that doesn't always work, but it does here.  It helps that the voice acting isn't terrible (a curse that many of these games have).Minigame puzzles were generally challenging without being obnoxious or illogical; only a couple were somewhat tedious.  There is a convenient skip button for people that are stuck (or impatient).Hidden object scenes were not overly challenging but did take some thought.  Graphically, scenes weren't grainy and it wasn't hard to distinguish objects from one another.  Objects are appropriately named (no searching for a ""soccer ball"" that turns out to be a volleyball, etc.).All in all, this is one of the better choices for this genre of game."
,Recommended,302130,13002655,"Posted: 19 November, 2014",all,Usagi,"I am unsure what to say about this game. Was it bad? No. Did I like it? No. I would recommend buying this if there is a sale, I just found it lacking in things that I like in these types of games. While an overall decent experience I personally found a few aspects annoying, however nothing game breaking.Biggest thing that annoyed me, the story. It's trying very hard to be scary and a psychological mind game but in the end I just got bored of Oscar's yapping and was barely invested in saving Anna. The game lacked a lot of inner monologue from Sam, the main character. You spend a majority of the game just listening to the antagonist Oscar, Sam just breathes heavy and growls. In the end I knew nothing much about Sam or Anna and I didn't quite care what happened to them, I just wanted Oscar to shut up.The second big thing that I didn't like was the lack of hidden item scenes. The game seems to be mostly made up of mini game puzzles. Which is fine if that is your thing, however I found a lot of them tedious and was hankering for more of the lovely artwork found in the hidden item scenes. What hidden item scenes were present in the game were very fun and I enjoyed the challenge.Those two things aside, it's a solid game. But an engaging story and bountiful hidden item scenes are the main things I enjoy about this genre and this game didn't quite deliver there, in my opinion. The game also has no achievements or trading cards so if you're a collector it won't help you there. However, it is still worth a play through if you look past the few issues I mentioned, unless you like them then I say game on!This review is exclusively written forY.A - Yolo Army, follow the group's curationshere!"

The story itself is interesting in the fact that you're in a manor with traps made by a crazy but clever man. Your own character makes noises when he's fearing something or when he's asking himself what to do or coughing, reflecting the bad weather in the game. What I truly enjoyed is an option to put more ""grains"" in your screens: you're really plunging into another atmospher with them. Voice acting is correct and the music is fitting to the story.  My only problem is that I can't use the map for travelling, I've to go back and forth between rooms. And the map is also showing more than any other HOG game, which can be a good thing. The graphics and drawings are also quite good. I had to skip only one minigame (the train one) because I felt it wasn't really an easy one that I would have solved (I rarely use the guide anyway). The bonus chapter is also good and closing the story with an important twist. So yeah, I recommend it really to anyone."

It's got some good puzzles, but the music and sound effects get tiring after a while.  And it's really frustrating, as others have noted, to have to walk back through multiple rooms to get from one to the other.Some of the puzzles were challenging.  Others were just too repititious and boring.  I think I used the guide for this game - along with the ""Skip"" choice - more than any other puzzle game I've played.  I also guessed how the game would end so that was a bit fun.That being said - I'll probably play the game a few more times, to see if I can figure out some of the games I skipped.  And now that I understand the map icons better (even if you can't do something in a room it's marked as of interest), I'll see if I like it more or like it less.The bonus chapter was fun, but I found that the ending was lame."

Explore a house full of traps and puzzles while constantly being taunted by Oscar.  Some puzzles are quickly solved and others take a bit of time.  A few are just boring time sinks that add nothing productive to the game but overall most are enjoyable.  A map helps you get around the rather large house and grounds, but there is no quick travel inspite of the need to constantly revisit locals over and over again.  The story line is well done with equally well done music and voice acting.  I especially enjoyed the bonus chapter which while short and a bit to easy adds a nice twist to the storyline."

The only thing is that Oscar talks a lot than the MC himself. Though I got used to it so it was fine with me. The art was amazing. Just many nice places to look at. My favorite place was the place with mermaid and the pool.Since this HOG was dark the game also tried to be scary. In my opinion I think the scare factor wasn't scary at all. I wish the game was more scarier. Also to be honest the story also bored me a little bit. But it's not like the story was super bad either. I would rate the story netural.The bonus story was fun to play. The ending I didn't see coming. Just wish the the bonus story was longer.All in all this was a fun HOG to play:) But the HOG could of been better. Got this HOG on a sale.

It has a very creepy storyline and some new puzzles. I actually had to skip two because I just couldn't work them out. I got around 6hrs play including the bonus chapter. The characters mouths moved, and the extras such as moaning and hyperventilating made this game exciting. There are not that many hidden object scenes, but they were good with some puzzles within them. The only thing I didn't like was that there was no teleport feature. It was annoying running back and forth, but the game would have finished a lot earlier without it. I still recommend it."

The story is suspenseful and the Voice Actor for the villian did a great job and will keep you tuned in.

The story starts as you arrive at the mansion of the serial murderer you were investigating who has responded by abducting your girlfriend. You then have to navigate your way through the mansion, which has been set up with traps and puzzles to give you a chance to save her.The HOG scenes here are fine and I didn't have any problems, there is a reasonable challenge here, and the graphics are fine and don't get in the way. The point and click sections between also flow very well, nothing too illogical and the scenario of the madman in his own mansion means a lot of scope for puzzles and needing to scavenge and jury rig solutions to progress without it seeming odd or out of place, which helps keep immersion in the story.One weakness here is the puzzles - not all of them - but some are not really puzzles as such, they are completely trivial solutions that are just time consuming to do all the moves, for example the rainbow puzzle which looked like it would be an extended ""Towers of Hanoi"" style puzzle, but just ends up being a trivial solution just a lot of shuffling all the pegs left and right repeatedly.But apart from that one issue with some of the puzzles, otherwise this is one of the best HOGs available, so highly recommended."

This one was a nice HOG, with a decent amount of puzzles, and a competent storyline aboutan artista psychopath (Oscar) who has kidnapped your girlfriend (Anna) and plans to make a 3D-Gioconda with her. There's a bonus chapter which is (undestandingly) shorter and a little bit more linear than the main story but was also fun to play. The ending is a bit surprising. On the cons chapter, I'd say the hint system was a little bit annoying 'cause it didn't point you to the right direction (as other HOGs I have recently played do); instead it just said wether there was or wasn't something to do in the current room so sometimes you had to revisit every room to know what was missing (but then again, maybe that's good, that's what many players look for when playing a HOG). I'd say there's a nice amount of job (well) done in this game. It was worth my money and I will definitely wishlist the other Brink of Consciousness title available."

Sounds familar and it all plays out through the killers house of horrors. In the house you will solve puzzles, HOG and look for objects that will help you gain access to other objects or areas. Again, pretty normal but for this particular game my intrest was in the killer who almost is doing his best Joker impersonation, without being the joker. Inside the house of Oscar, the serial killer, he sees himself as an artist who has kidnapped young people and then embalmed them in these large tubes as show pieces around the house. Its sort of eerie but his explanation turns towards their betrayl of his trust and love. Sort of interesting, but cliche but the voice work and writing are not bad and while i was hoping for a better conclusion its always more about the journey than the end.The puzzles and hidden objects are hit and miss and i found myself skipping a few(for the first time ever) as there are some that the trial and error becomes time consuming and sort of frustrating. There are also a few objects in scenes which are almost invisible and some of the multi tear hidden objects puzzles are not clearly defined. Luckily, a hint system, skip puzzle and the complete walkthru are all attached to the toolbar for easy access.Brink of Consciousness is just OK as it doesnt stray away from the HOG blueprint and for fans of the genre thats fine.PositivesGood writing and voice acting for the serial killerThe scenes are all manageable and look clearNot origianl but still fun and relaxingGood musical scoreGuide and hints attached to the toolobarNegativesVery safe and predictablePuzzles are inconsitentSome multi tear hidden objects not well defined"

Unike almost every other HOG in existence, the voice acting is excellent and the story very good.  The HOGs, puzzles, graphics, and gameplay, in general, are also all very good.  The only issue I've got with the game, itself, is that it needs a framerate limiter.  While I was playing it, my framerate ranged from 800 fps up to almost 4,000 fps.  It's possible, though, that that was because I played the game in a Crossover emulation bottle under Linux.  I do have two thematic problems with the game.  First, the game involves a trail of bodies from a psychopathic mass murderer.  So, it's not exactly goodness and light.  Similarly, the ending leaves me a bit ambivalent.  Things are tied up (especially after the bonus chapter).  But again, not goodness and light.I got a total of 5.9 hours of excellent gameplay out of it (4.9 hours in the base game and another hour in the bonus chapter).

The map in this game was almost useless.  Not having the ability to click on an area of the map and immediately go there makes a game like this tedious to play.

The game doesn't have as many puzzles as you would expect given the number of rooms that you wander through ... over and over and over again. Having that elevator that you have to use multiple times just adds to the tedium. You spend most of the game simply looking for pieces to use to open various doors and objects. The actual puzzles range from tediously dumb to somewhat of a challenge. The ending is a letdown. Why didn't she just do that in the beginning and save us all the trouble? There are better puzzle games available, so I can't recommend spending any time with this one."

The dead people are the jump-scares by the way. I would add psychological to this, the killer did a fairly good job annoying the heck out of me with his taunting. The graphics are good, and the creepiness factor made it so I couldn't really play this by myself in a room... Annnnyway I probably should have read the description first before hopping in. I'd still recommend it if you're into the dark games."

Definitely worht the money. The interface is good, the art is great, the sound is fine, and the story is very compelling, especially by hidden object games standards, which are often light on story.Definitely pick this one up."

One of the best stories Ive heard for a bit but the hints button is useless it only works for the room you are in. If you dont mind a bit of hard work in a game (shock horror) its great although a true fix would make this game perfect
