The animated video is a bit choppy, the gameplay is not smooth, overall it looks a bit fuzzy due to the low resolution of the graphics, and the conversation flow is a clunky.  Just be prepared for all that.On the good side, it is a fairly enjoyable puzzler.  The makers mixed in some real history and rituals into the game, so that is an added bonus.If you can get it on a sale, I think it would be worth picking up."
,Recommended,302160,12616852,"Posted: 24 October, 2014",all,Atelier Ani,"I'm not one to play Adventure games much; I'd like to play them more, but I often lack the patience.This game, however, kept me firmly firmly seated from start to finish, quite literally; before I'd realised it, I'd finished the whole game in one go. The puzzles may seem easy to someone who plays adventure games a lot, and do lack that element of obtuse adventure-game-developer-logic, but a few puzzles do require some actual knowledge of Egyptian mythology on the player's part. The ending does seem a little abrupt, and at 5 hours it may seem a little stumpy, but it keeps up a nice pace and doesn't wear out its welcome.The game doesn't look horrible for its age, and though the voice acting threw me a little at the beginning, you get used to it fairly easily. It's also nice to see that effort was made with name pronounciations, unlike most games that handle any names other than English.Definitely try it out if you're into Egypt-themed stuff; maybe if you're on the fence about adventure games, too.Also if you're looking for a game with some decent female characters - it's refreshing to play a game with a female protagonist, in which her gender isn't an issue."

Many puzzles that not too easy to solve are main part of a game and there are beautiful concept arts though this game is quite old. The soundtracks are mediocre but they are quite odd because they are egyptian style. I had a lot of fun because the story of this game is awesome. One problem that really annoying me is that there always blurring vision when there come to cutscenes in game, I don't recommended this game to anyone who had seizure or migraine and I mean it seriously but if you just skip it so it's ok to play through."

Despite reading some bad comments about it here, since I love this type of games of ""point and click"" adventures, I decided to give it a try. If you tried this type of games before and you are searching for a ""new"" one, I think you should give this one a chance! This type of game is not created very often these days, so I really have to turn to the older ones... Some of the puzzles are really cool (if you like Egyptian history, you will like the details), and I didn't find any of them particularly hard (maybe because I'm used to these games). I mean, sometimes you will have to search for quite some time, but that search is the part of the game that gets you thinking, and it's enjoyable.Try it!"

Locate the file Egypt3.exe and right click. Open ""Properties"", then “Compatibility"" and ""Run compatibility troubleshooter"". Choose ""Try recommended settings"" and when done test the program. This worked for me and the game now runs smoothly in full screen."

76561198025531773,Recommended,302160,15335089,"Posted: 13 April, 2015",all,DreamWarriors,"It's an adventure game with a Myst-like interface.The story wasn't the greatest but interesting enough to keep me playing.The setting of ancient Egypt was the brightest aspect of the game. The game provides history and game notes in the menus, and after reading it all of the religiousy stuff made more sense. And there were a lot of religiousy stuff. Priests, Gods, Magic, Rituals, Potions, etc. I'm not an Egyptologist, so I don't know how much of it was fictionalized, however, the cities, gods, and historical figures seemed to be real.The graphics were decent for 2004 and the cutscenes were above average. The voice acting was hit or miss. I thought the female characters' voices were excellent.The ""find stuff"" parts of the game was frustrating. I cheated a few times by Googling where item 'x' was located, because I felt stupid wasting so much time traveling from room-to-room while hovering the mouse cursor over every object to see if it was interactive.Most of the puzzles were on the easy side except for a couple of brain teasers.The last boss battle was the hardest part. That's because the rules to the mini-game weren't completely explained.If the above sounds like your cup of tea, wait for a Steam sale. That's how I bought it. At the low price, expectations were low, and the ""pleasant surprise"" was high."

So if you like me get really dizzy when playing such a game this is not for you.I also admit I have only played this game for half an hour but that was enough for me. Usually I like most point and click games I play but this I found really bad in the short time I struggled with dizziness. The charactors are kind of dead and you feel nothing at all for them. And the voices are also dead. I have played much older games that was much more inspiring than this and much better made. There is just no heart in it.
,Recommended,302160,15689249,"Posted: 4 May, 2015",all,HimeJezabel,"This was part of a bundle, so I didn't have high expectations from this game, especially after reading the reviews. It was really not as bad as I thought it would be. Sure, the graphics are dated and the voice-acting not really top-notch, but I enjoyed the Egyptian theme and atmosphere it had going.You play an Egyptian priestess in first person trying to save the Pharaoh by stopping a curse. You gain spells throughout the game to help you on your way.The movement took a short while to get used to, the 'hitbox' of moving to next place was not intuitive and the arrow was smaller than expected, but when you get used to it, it should be no problem.It's pure point&click game, and it has a lot of backstory. If you're into mythology/Egypt you should enjoy it. The game gives you a lot of info about the theme on files you can read if you so wish. I don't think any non-usable items were clickable and the game is almost too 'clean' so it's rare to get lost or stuck.Not the best p&c ever, but not as bad as the reviews make it out to be. I encountered no bugs and only had to look up a couple of things on a guide to get me through.Not sure if it was a bug, but using 'clairvoyance' on some people makes Maya say ""I see... a donkey"" which was overly amusing to me.Worth buying as part of a bundle with some better games or on high discount sale."

I found that i struggled locating items or would be at a loss for where to head next. While other times its was painfully easy to know what was next. The puzzles where challenging and I did like how the final boss battle happened.5/10maybe buy on sale if you are really into point-n-clicks"

Back when I was a kid I loved this game so much.I had never seen a point-and-click game before and this was a whole new way of playing. It was very challenging aswell!Just bought it now because of the nostalgic trip it would have given me.Too bad it wont even start on my Windows 10 x64.Please Steam you are like a grocery store whos selling blue uneatable bananas for full price 10 years after the banana grew in its tree.

To start with had the screen flicker others on Win 7 have mentioned but an Nvidia update actually sorted out. Found the movement a little disorientating at times. Terrible script, terribly acted. There is information available in the game about Egyptian gods, religion, myths and magic but I'm not that interested in Egyptian history. Decided I didn't care whether the pharoah died or not.....gave up. Even if you love both all things pyramid shaped and adventure games think very carefully before getting this."

But no. It's just so boring. Maybe it would pick up the pace later, but I lost interest after trudging through so many empty rooms.I also dislike the 2D-wannabe-3D graphics. I acknowledge that the game is 10 years old now, but it looks too sterile for a point-and-click game and the 3D movement animation is not a redeeming factor for me. The old hand-drawn backgrounds of Sierra and Lucasarts just convey so much more."

Everything is rendered but it looks like Playstation 2 and that ages way worse than drawn graphics. The game itself is pretty linear and offers few possibilities. It's not one of the worse point&click games.

The creators clearly did some research and kept to the Mythos.Beautiul graphics and music.The only bad thing is that I was able to finish the game in 6 hours.Overall, I'd say it was worth buying on sale for an afternoon of gaming."
,Recommended,302160,15084807,"Posted: 27 March, 2015",all,Al,"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much out of this one. Got it on a coupon, and saw that it didn't have a whole lot of positive reviews. It was enough to keep me from playing it for several months. After finishing it, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.This is an obscure, weird little game. Rather than put most of its focus on narrative, like most point-and-click titles, this seems balanced in all aspects, though the story is still quite fine. It's a mystery that manages to stay exciting by avoiding realism as often as possible. The main points are easy to follow due to the fact that the game drives them into the ground like it's a Dragon Ball Z episode. The story is supported by decent voice acting and most of the puzzles are not so easy as to be boring, but not so hard as to warrant breaking out a guide. The music is smooth and fitting of the theme.The environments are open and only have a few locations in which there is nothing to do. Every spot the player can stand in allows a full 360 degree rotation to observe your surroundings, which often lack detail but don't waste time with a lot of pointless clutter. It is usually easy to have a sense of where to go, and I found the direction-based click controls to not be very misleading. I wish I could say that the characters looked fine too, but they look like a bunch of PS1 cutscene models. The prerendered cutscenes here look a little better than the actual game.Aside from the game,this also has a bit of info about Egyptian mythology and legends, if you're into that sort of thing, which might be why you decided to take a look in the first place. Overall, it manages to just be an average point and click that knows how to play to the strong points of its genre."
