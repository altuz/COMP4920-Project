,Recommended,302180,11917868,"Posted: 29 August, 2014",all,shoggofu,"I played this game for just under two hours. I found it interesting, but I spent at least half the time being stuck and not knowing what to do.- It's another old (2005) point and click adventure from this publisher and developer, but the user interface is better than their other similar titles- Your objectives are vague and it is easy to spend a very long time stuck and unable to make progress just by missing a single small detailhttp://youtu.be/64AirnGvTYAhttp://youtu.be/m2S-aiyGCvsYou have a pre-rendered 360 degree panoramic view of your environment. When you move to different locations your perspective will be that of the new location. I haven't played Myst before. But I've been told that this is basically what Myst is like.-----You interact with the environment in order to solve problems and progress through game. You find many items which can be used with certain objects in the environment. Certain inventory items can be combined with others to create new objects. Not all items appear to be essential to progressing through the game. Some items and actions appear to unlock extras such as information about characters and lore about the alien species.-----So you start in the very confined space of the shell which has been fired out of giant cannon to take you to the moon. It was an interesting location. But unfortunately I spent over an hour in this tiny little area area. This was because I often became stuck and couldn't figure out what to do.-----Inside the shell you periodically get to the point where you are running out of oxygen and need to find a way to remedy the situation. Once this happens you have about a minute to get more oxygen otherwise you die. I died at least twenty times or so. When you die you reappear in the shell and you lose no items or progress, nothing in the ship resets to it's originals state. So dying from lack of oxygen didn't really serve any purpose except to be a nuisance. It took me quite me a while to find the solution the first time. The second time also took me a quite a while to discover. I basically found myself scraping the bottom of the barrel. I had to actually look up a walk-through. It turned out that all I needed to do was turn a small wheel. I had no idea about this even though I'd searched through the whole shell again and again. This is what I spent most my two hours stuck on.-----Finally I arrived on the moon. Which was an interesting place. There were various colorful and animated plants, I came across some alien technology and you had to made great leaps across a chasm in order to navigate the environment.-----But I soon got a stuck again for a substantial amount of time. Only when I was coming to the end of my two hour play-through did I figure out how to progress some more. Again it was something kind of obvious which I'd just overlooked. Things at that point got a bit more interesting again, but unfortunately I didn't have time to keep playing.-----I know some people will be against this notion. But sometimes it can be too frustrating to get stuck for so long. It would have been cool if there were more specifics hints. This feature could be optional so that people who want to do it the hard way still can. Hints could have cool-down and only become available once you have been stuck for a certain amount of time in order to prevent over-reliance on them.  But it's probably a bit too much to ask from an old game, and yes I'm sure some people would feel it would ruin the challenge.-----When I stopped playing I'd found several alien machines. Including a coin operated telescope which was quite amusing. There is also a whole series of 'ideograms', basically alien hieroglyphics. You are able to decipher these in order to understand some of their meanings. I thought that was quite interesting. These ideograms apparently must play a role in understanding the operation of the alien devices and so on. I also caught sight of the aliens but I was unable to get close enough to interact with any of them.The game looks alright, keep in mind it is an old title. I think the pre-rendered graphics is a better alternative to 3D graphics which probably wouldn't have looked very good at a level that PCs were capable of running back then. Some areas can look a bit plain, such as the interior of the shell especially if you've been stuck in it for over an hour lol-----Once I'd gotten to the moon, the game reminded me a quite a bit of the another old point and click adventure title, The Dig. That game was by Lucasarts and in it you also travel through space and spend the game on a alien planet solving puzzles to progress.I like the game, but I'd find it hard to make the time for. Ideally this is a good game if you are prepared to spend a lot of time figuring out what to do and have a lot of patience in case you get stuck for extended periods unable to make progress. Otherwise you could refer to a walk-though to guide you. There is at least one available which is you can find on YouTube.Clickherefor my YouTube gaming channel"

For anyone interested in point-and-click adventure games I do recommend getting it though, especially because it is quite cheap with a coupon.I played this game back in 2006 I think and am very happy to see it on Steam since I lost my old copy of the game. I found the puzzles actually very fun and the entire game is put together well with 360 degree views of certain areas in a good amount of detail, especially for a game from 2005. There is only a couple timed puzzles, though dying in the them does nothing except cause a small cutscene which is easily skippable - also being able to save at any point in the game is useful. The inventory system is easy to use, though organising it can be a little tedious. Also, there is multiple ways of solving most things, and some puzzles aren't even required to do until later in the game - (You might even solve a puzzle without knowing what it's for until later!)Overall, A very good point-and-click puzzle-adventure game.For anyone who can't solve puzzles and requires a walkthough there is a couple on the internet, and I have written my own in the Steam 'Guides' page if you are interested, it also explains how to set up the game on Windows 7, and it might also work for 8. (But don't hold me against it if it doesn't...)"

Saw how old it was but thought ""o well might as well check it out""And ooh boy...did I get sucked in.  I am allready a big fan of point n click adventures, and this is a true classic. I have to admit i got impatient at times, not taking enough time to read back in my log.Some parts I found quite hard. I did not finish it without a lot of dying and trial and error. And also peeking  a walkthrough from time to time. Usually the result of that was me thinking: , ahh yeh, this makes sense, i should have thought about that.  At 1 occassion i found a mistake.  I got so frustrated , that eventually a walkthrough helped me.  Only way i could have maybe solved this was by randomly trying combinations.  I iwll describe the issue below with a spoiler alert. Altho not knowing is rather a spoiler in this case;)At some point you have to call out for the aliens outside using an organ. You have to push the button in a certain order to get the aliens moving. One alien , according to the instructions should be called with first the blue and then red button. This is not true! This must be first purple and then red!The story is very cool, the variation of puzzles too.  It really felt like learning a new language;) Also the reward for completing parts is nice. You unlock parts of the story with that.Abolutely recommened for point n click lovers........and Jules Verne lovers. After all, the story is about his book. And since he is a brilliant writer, that alone makes  playing this game worthwhile.Glad I managed to land safely on earth again and glad I discovered this adventure.9/10"

The puzzle is good but it needs high creativity and thinking that makes the puzzle too hard sometimes. I can finish this game earlier than I expected because I searched for walkthrough lol. I stuck at many points because the puzzle needs some rollback about what you saw earlier.Anyway, this is a good game. Recommend this game for someone who likes science fiction story and point and click adventure game. (For my playtime, my game crashed when I almost finished the game and I didn't save the game for a 5 hours of gameplay and so my playtime increased a lot orz )7.5/10"

,Not Recommended,302180,19291607,"Posted: 26 November, 2015",all,Michael Culbertson,"I really wanted to like this game. But, one of the main reasons I play adventure games is that I don't want to have to deal with the pressure of fast action or quick reflexes. However, not long into the game, you suddenly realize that it's getting a bit difficult to breathe, and a timer starts for you to figure out how to increase the oxygen level in your little capsule. Inevitably, the timer runs out before you find the right action, and your tragic death is announced. Of course, the timer resets, and you have another go at it, until you meet your second untimely death, then your third, or however many tries it takes before you discover (or look up) how to get past the barrier.Then, when you get to the moon, there are these large crevasses to cross by jumping just the right amount in the moon's low gravity. Now, ""just the right amount"" is determined by a needle that is moving up and down. If you hit the key when the needle is in the green region, you make it across. If not, the announcer is back with another enthusiastic heralding of your untimely death. It's terribly demoralizing.What's worse, there is some bug that prevents the menu from displaying properly so that you can't always save (or exit!) the game reliably once you've crossed some annoying hurdle.After a couple of hours, I found the game too frustrating to continue, which is a shame, because the story and graphics seemed promising."

There is a lot of time spent trying to figure out what the heck to do next. Little to no explaination as to what you should do to progress. I got to the moon, three hours into it. I got stuck (for the millionth time) and quit after 15 minutes of clicking everything I could. There are also certain things you need to find for achievements, but it's extreamly easy to miss them. (Throw something important off of the shuttle perchance? It's okay, you can restart all of your work.) I bought it on sale, it still wasn't worth it to me."

I especially like the many things you can do with the fruit.It is quite challenging at times, but never too difficult or too easy. Even the second  time playing it ten years later I had forgotten a lot of details and had a lot of fun reliving the experience and puzzles.Today it looks a bit more dated offcourse, but for yhe genre that is no problem at all and you soon forget about resolutions when you are playing.Give it a chance and you will love it."
