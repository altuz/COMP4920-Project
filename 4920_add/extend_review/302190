While this is his first adventure ever and is rather dated in comparison to the new stuff on the market, it is still very much playable. Challenging and imaginative it is a point and click adventure which will entertain you for several hours. His landscapes, creatures and inventions often inspire a smile. While most story tellers rely on cheap sudden twists, his story telling abilities rely mostly on interconnections. If you loved games like Siberia, then this is a must and its only 99 cents.The downfalls is that it is dated and the graphics are hardly crisp, some of the puzzles are really hard and have you scurrying for a walk through. And some of the letters that you find littered around the landscapes are hardly readable like a doctor's prescription on News Years. Hopefully one day they will update this beautiful game to HD...."

,Recommended,302190,18336316,"Posted: 4 October, 2015",all,FOAMY89,"Amerzone is one of those gaming experiences that will stick with me probably for the better part of my life. It's a point-and-click adventure game a la Myst, but it's pretty different. It's not puzzle heavy at all, in fact I think there are only 5 major puzzles in the entire game. It's all about the story and the people in it. And it's a beautiful story about a story:You start off by happening upon a dying man's last request. He asks you to return a sacred egg to Amerzone. All other agencies have turned down his requests for an expedition to go back to Amerzone. Not only that, but the country (or continent? not totally sure) is going through a dictatorship with a lot of bad results. There's a dash of steampunk and a dash of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle influence in the game, but this game really does feel like a story on its own. I didn't have any problems with how old the game is (I didn't play it when it first came out). The only rela problems I had with it were the parts where you had to traverse the jungle or a swamp and I'd get lost a bunch of times, but not enough to stop me from playing.You, of course, end up completing the old adventurer's request, but the real special thing about this game is that while you are going on your adventure to finish his, you're basically tracking his footprints from decades ago and seeing how much things have changed. Instead of a busy town with lots of people in a trade market, you come upon a barren desolate town, a ghost town, where a couple of policemen drink their meaningless lives away. There's a lot being said here about culture and knowing your roots. The country is basically trying to fast-track itself into the developed world but by doing so is completely ignoring its rich heritage.TLDR:This game is like a quiet poem that was whispered to you by someone old who passed away, and  you never really know if what they said was real or just a story. If you like games that are all about atmosphere and don't mind that this game is old then I recommend it. Also of course if you like Syberia you'll enjoy this. It's not very long, but I found the experience very rewarding.Cheers."

,Recommended,302190,17019237,"Posted: 12 July, 2015",all,shiaakuma,"This isn't a bad game, although definitely dated.  It perhaps hasn't aged as well as some older games, but it's worth a play if you like the genre.  It did seem rather short to me and the story fell apart a bit in places, so I would recommend getting it in a bundle if possible or on sale.Graphically very pretty for the time period it was created in, although somewhat fuzzy/pixelated on a modern system in places.  Nothing game breaking.  There was some minor annoyance in some parts that seemed too dark to see what was needed to progress, but that was very few places.  Character models probably aged the worst, but there are very few of them so no matter.  Animal models still look quite good; for example, the critters playing fetch with my grappling hook late in the game were delightfully well done.The format is point-and-click in what I like to call ""freestyle Myst"" style, in that as you move around from spot to spot, you stand still in a static location as you do in Myst or Dark Fall, but you have free 360 degree freedom of view and click the movement arrows to move from spot to spot.  There is limited inventory and the interface is a little clunky, but again, nothing that is game breaking.The story is straightforward but does leave a few holes and has some sketchy logic, but it was enjoyable.  While I do normally like games that leave me some room to mull over what happened and what it may mean, this one could have used some more detail and fleshing out of story and characters.  I had some questions that were more than just ""give the player something to think about"" problems and more ""I think the player should have this information"" problems.Anyway, I will recommend this because there is no ""in the middle"" option.  Given a choice between yes or no, I'd say yes, even though it hasn't aged as well as other games, because the story is interesting and the fantastical pseudo-Amazon setting is pretty fun to experience.  If you like the genre, give it a shot especially if you can find it on sale."

Now after more than 15 years, I've finally finished the entire game in 3 hours, everything seemed a lot smaller, easier and faster.

I found it all engaging and fun.Love Benoit Sokal's work :) Playing this early game was a treat."
,Recommended,302190,13300258,"Posted: 9 December, 2014",all,frenk10,"TLDR version: Get if for a discount.The game is sweet and short, and it has a great atmosphere and storyline.Main disadvantages: it doesn't run windowed and it's very hard to orientate yourself, with no indicator which direction you're facing. Graphics are decent but dated, but for an adventure game that's of minor concern for me. Another bigger annoyance is the fact that the game contains a lot of handwritten letters, which are quite hard to read due to the illegible handwriting.As you'll complete this game in just a few hours, i'd say buy it on a 50% or more discount and you'll have some enjoyable hours for your money."
,Recommended,302190,19811687,"Posted: 20 December, 2015",all,kaijushima,"Benoît Sokal's games have always been interesting and immersive with all around good writing and gameplay. While I wait for Syberia 3 I figured I would catch up on some of the ones I missed, Amerzone being one of them. It is a decent game with the story and journal style plot exposition that I love from his other games and it does give an insight into how Sokal has progressed over the years. The graphics are dated but from a game from 1999 I didn't expect anything different. The mechanics are basic and a little clunky, the puzzles are a little obtuse and I don't know if I will ever replay the game again but it was worth it from a completists point of view. If I had skipped over it I would always have wondered what it was like so I do reccomend it but I would say don't go in expecting a Syberia level experience."

People on forums were talking about this game, so I bought it to try it out.At first, my expectations were high cause of fantastic Syberia, but it was fail from the start. I installed Amerzone on my XP cause the game was old. It was VERY buggy from the beginning as I couldn't even finish first half of chapter 1. Bummer .... So I tried Amerzone on W7 and it was not so buggy as I was moving through the game. I have to say that there are only a few NPC's in the game, so I was very dissapointed. Also, the game is easy which is cool as you don't need a walkthrough and it is finished in a couple of hours. Graphics were probably great at the time and sound effects and ambient are fantastic !! There are a lot of FMV's as you unravel a GREAT STORY and fantastic world through your voyage but there are also a lot of cliches in screenplay.Overall, I would give 74/100 score.For everyone who likes Myst games this is a great game and not so bad for adventure fans as myself. Enjoy ...."

The atmosphere in he art direction and the fantastic scripts more than make up for it. Amerzone is a particularly mature title, exploring themes of life and death in a refreshing way, and this thing came out in 1999. If you want a good example of making the best with what you got, this game definitely fits. It's five bucks and worth every penny."
76561198000232272,Recommended,302190,13707425,"Posted: 29 December, 2014",all,Ramsey,"Amerzone is an old school adventure game.  Initially released in 1999, it was the first game designed by Benoit Sokal who is better known for his later Syberia adventure games.Although it runs remarkably well through Steam, it has all the drawbacks you might expect from such an old game.  The graphics are very dated and most scenes are static except for a few cut-scenes.  You can’t run in windowed mode, nor can you minimize/Alt-Tab out of the game.  This can be a big deal if you need to consult a walkthrough for help with one of the many puzzles as you will need to save and quit and then restart the game after getting help.  Thankfully, load times are short and you can save at any point.Amerzone's story is interesting, but not action-packed.  The puzzles are fair.  Most solutions aren’t instantly obvious, nor ridiculously complex, and they seem to make sense for the most part.  The pixel hunting is kept to a minimum and you won’t have dozens of inventory items to keep track of.  The voice-work, music and sounds are passable.Amerzone can be completed in less than five hours if you are an experienced adventurer, but it can purchased very cheaply, usually as part of a game bundle.  As long as your expectations are reasonable based on the game’s age, most adventure gamers will enjoy this classic."

The gameplay is similar to Sherlock Holmes The Mystery of the Mummy, in which the scenery is like looking at a 360 degree matte painting while being filmed with a fish eye lens camera. However unlike that game, this game has easier puzzles and you interact with more people that drive the story allong. The graphics show their age, but since this is Sokal's first work, I'll excuse it for looking stiff. Controls are sometimes flawed but the game is still playable and will be favored by fans of European games."

The game was also very short at best 3 hours if you are experienced with point and click, and the puzzles are mostly find the only clickable item and use.  I enjoyed my time playing, but i can't recommend it. Unless your new to point and click it's the perfect game to start in. As the puzzles aren't hard, only 2 need thinking,  there's no death or dead ends. In the end If pretty(for the time) Visuals made a game it would be top of my list sadly you need good puzzles and most of all a good story.If you don't mind easy puzzles and little story this is a good point and click for you.
