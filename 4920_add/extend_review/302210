Graphics are a little rough and the controls suck... but the atmosphere is great, and that is what counts with these types of games.Regarding compatability issues, Im on windows 7 with and AMD card and a i5 processor and had no issues what so ever, other than an arm stretching glitch in one room, which was just silly to me. Nothing game breaking."

So $5 is no bad deal for a trip down memory lane for me. This game is a Resident Evil 1, 2,3  knock off. It does have issues, but most of this is due to the age of the game. The story is solid. The character moves when you need him to. The clues are all laid out. The Settings are fun. I am especially fond of the museum. The grafics are dated and so is the gameplay. The movement especially , no matter what way you are facing you must press up in order for your character to move.All and all I do recomend the game it is one of those older games that got missed back in the day. If you have an afternoon free and you are waiting for the next big release game, try it is only about $5. If you do not want to pay that I am sure this game will go sale on the big Steam Sales possibly for $1 or less. And it is anly about 600MB. not much room at all, barly took me 3 min. to download. So I say give it a try."

Long story short, this is a fun survival horror game that was unfairly maligned when released.  Solid game play with an adventure feel like mixing Resident Evil 1-3, the Silent Hill series, Eternal Darkness and the Indiana Jones movies.  Definitely give it a check.Pros:-Old school survival horror gameplay-Decent graphics with fun monsters to fight, excellent locations to explore and entertaining bosses-Excellent, creepy sound design-Engaging story with 2 characters to switch between-Travelling inventory save/storage character is well-implemented-Satisfying campaign length (took me about 10 hours, some of my gameplay time was spent paused)-Solid selection of weapons-Cool mix between puzzles, exploration and combatCons:-Clunky controls and unable to remap movement keys (you get used to it)-Story conclusion is somewhat half baked-Character models could use some work-2 different characters but no different abilities-More melee weapons would be fun-Body part targeting mechanic is under-utilized (necessary in boss fights but really nowhere else)Rating:  7.8/10Fans of overlooked, underrated horror games like Cold Fear, Cursed Mountain, etc., should have a blast with this!"

,Not Recommended,302210,23389162,"Posted: 4 June, 2016",all,Toxic League,"Curse: The Eye of Isis is an action adventure on the likes of early Resident Evil games where you play the role of two different characters on a mission to remove a curse from your family as a result of displacing the Isis statue. While the overall story is reasonable, I got really frustrated with the game on so many levels.The keyboard controls were so awful I ended up using a controller, but those controls were only slightly less awful. The biggest pain was the ever changing camera angles which seemed to be almost purposely meant to frustrate movement on a level I have never experienced. The combat was absolute trash, especially the boss fights. When a billy club can dish out more damage than a mortar cannon, you know there's some serious issues. There's an endless supply of respawning minions that further make combat more mundane than entertaining. Finding the next objective is near impossible. There are no way points and there is no objective list to aid your quest. You do have a fat dude sidekick that always spawns after whatever obstacle you were trying to overcome, but he can't help you get past the obstacle. The inventory system was a mess to the point of not having slots available to pick up key quest items and no way to actually drop items other than giving them to said fat man or your alternate character.I honestly can't believe I finished this game because there were so many moments where I just wanted to rage uninstall. If you're like me and enjoy enduring constant pain and misery, then this is a title worthy of playing. I'm going to go walk on some broken glass barefoot now."

(compared to most horror titles now, the enemies seem a bit goofy and unthreatening, but the soundeffects they make are enough to still get your heartrate up, especially when you hear them coming but dont know where from)Overall enjoyment: 8/10Especially when you get it for a buck like I did.(recommed Hard Difficulty on first playthrough)"

Only minor problems with the game, controls seem a little clunky at first but they don't take much to adapt to. It's been awhile since a game truly gave me the feel of suspense without resorting to jump scares, gore or even music. the ambiencde is subtle but effective.I'm not even a horror gamer, the only game that I'd play is the Last of Us and that was probably the worst i went, as creepy as some others may be they don't achieve what these 2 games do."
,Recommended,302210,29935390,Posted: 14 February,all,Raymond,"Curse: The Eye of Isis Review - Raymond KTThough Capcom's Resident Evil series achieved legendary status by the late 1990s, both it and the survival horror boom that it spawned haven't been quite as popular in the past couple of years. However, Asylum Entertainment is not following the prevailing trends. The small British developer, best known for a handful of kid-friendly PlayStation games like Powerpuff Girls: Chemical Xtraction and Teletubbies: Play With the Teletubbies, Despite the company's lack of experience with this sort of game-making, and a few noteworthy miscues, the designers have traced the footsteps of Resident Evil as carefully as a chiropodist. This leaves the end result without even the tiniest smidgen of originality, though it is a convincing memorial to a classic genre. – GamespotOne of the most memorable game I ever played. There are all sorts of fun moments in the game. Cool bosses, the undead zombies, hard-to-kill mummies, intriguing puzzles and wonderful locations- the game has it all. It is a marvelous game with a very good Storyline. Something in which the today's games really fall short . I would love to play a reboot. I think I like this game a lot because I was a fan of Resident Evil (early titles) but who knows!"
,Recommended,302210,13562189,"Posted: 23 December, 2014",all,Gamer,"A survival horror game that the atmosphere on the game is spot on. The controls may be a little meh but you can change buttons to your own preferences. The game may be overlooked but it is a classic gem. The background noises in the game are eerie and bone chilling. The only con i have about this game is the game doesn't like Steam overlay and the In-game status always crashes and it tells you you're not even playing the game even though you are but it's not that big of a deal. But I wished that they fixed that. Besides that, Curse: The Eye of Isis is an awesome survival horror game. I definitely recommend trying out this game."
,Not Recommended,302210,29540743,Posted: 28 January,all,Lintire,"We have a great review coming up. Wonderful review, I assure you, but first we're going to open with a little something. Curse: The Eye of Isis has great controls. Hard to believe with all these reviews that are just ""the controls are bad"", sure, but they're there. You just have to coax them out.Get a gamepad to work on your PC. I don't care how, make it happen. Xbox, should work natively, PS3/4, get the depreciated version of SCP Server or the one Dualshock 4 program everyone uses.Go into options and change control scheme from ""Keyboard"" to ""Joystick"". This also gets rid of the tank controls nobody likes.Now rebind the controls in the control option to whatever you like. You can't bind them to the triggers and the actual ""get me out of this game please"" menu is unbindable, stuck to Esc on the keyboard.Boom, fixed. Thank me later. On with the show.NEXT TIME I WON'T MISS- Le Chat, notable for this and being called ""Le Chat"".Curse: The Eye of Isis doesn't really do anything wrong.There's great controls, not quite 1:1 but you can run rings around opponents and even avoid bullets with ease. It has well designed characters who manage to make the conventional look unconventional. There's nice pacing, it never settles. There's even great production values - the shaders aren't great but the texture design and asset variety is there.Add a hammy plot that's straight out of a Saturday Morning cartoon. It's all there, all the ingredients, and it doesn't grossly mishandle any one bit on what should be a heart-filled and memorable clone of a popular game, that just sadly lacks the budget to compete with the best.So it's a challenge to really articulate why Curse: The Eye of Isis is so wholly forgettable and generic.This is normally where I put another quote.- already put the single memorable line from this game above so just roll with it.There's no real puzzles. 90% of the ""solutions"" to the item-based puzzles are located about two meters from the challenge in question. There's no real level exploration, you're led around by the nose and exploration outside of one select instance is either punished or forbidden - by wasting your time, or burning resources for nothing.There's no depth or variance to the world or story. Everything plays out exactly how you'd expect and does an incredibly tired job of it. There's no real horror: a few ""monster closets"" right at the end aside enemies just sort of sit in rooms, and then stay dead while spewing more resources then they consume (which is a fair bit to begin with, the average alive enemy will take five headshots before they die).There's no real character arcs - characters sort of just state what they want to do, or don't, then do it and occasionally scream each other's names from offscreen. The itty bitty arc there is, doesn't so much exist, so much as the Arabian fez-wearing save point flatly tells you it does.Everything is incredibly underwritten so you don't even have that much ham in this hammy story to enjoy. There are no surprises at all in this brown, grey slop of a game.Pretend I wrote something here.- pretty sure half the script for this game looks like that too.Some games bore you to tears. Curse: The Eye of Isis manages to avoid this while also avoiding doing a single thing of interest. It is a perfectly playable, well executed corporate product, that I am going to go to sleep tonight and completely forget about.If you're interested in a very cheap, very playable game then Curse: The Eye of Iris can contend with the other fifty billion of those on Steam. Otherwise just forget about this game, like everyone else has.Some games belong in the echelons of history. Some games belong in a garbage can. Curse: The Eye of Isis doesn't really belong anywhere."

There's glitches which are kinda funny, but makes you think is this game really finished. Examples, first boss attached to wall and it stucked there. Second boss hurted himself, I was thinking if I am going to play again this masterpiece Ill try to make it kill itself. (haha). But if you do not care about these little glitches, its worth of try.Also, its not like Resident evil, you CANT skip mobs, because sometimes mobs drops quest items that you NEED, so just kill everything and remember to loot em."

I don't think it detracts from the game, though. It has it's own charm.Pros:- Some scary moments/jumpscares (not too bad)- Decent puzzles- Story was alright- Good amount of gameplay- Holds up decently for a 15 yr old game- Abdul has always got your back- Definitely worth picking up on saleCons:- Fighting getsreallyeasy once you get the hang of it, I never died from combat.- Some vital information is never explicitly given to you (ie, that you can manipulate Abdul's inventory so he can hold stuff for you. He doestechnicallysay ""I can hold some items for you"" but it never tells you how to do that.Just open your inventory while facing him)- No objective tracking, tough if you stop playing for a while and forget what you were doing.- You never really have to use any ranged weapon, Truncheon is OP.- No way to remap movement controls- Boss fights are insanely easy- Some controls are really poor ( ie:The hook controls in that one boss fight)Overall I'd give it 6-7/10, I had fun playing it and I'd recommend giving it a try."

Guess the old 660 just couldn't hang and there totally were'nt any issues with this ancient game running on modern systems, lol.It's not fun.  It's creepy, dificult, and antiquated.Which is why I bought it.Fans of early RE, AITD: NN, and Silent Hill will dig this, and there is even some controller support once you dig into the settings.Now if only I could use my new card's capibilities and control panel to get this game looking as good as what I can get Jedi Academy looking.That's not steam's fault tho.TLDR; Game works now. Buy it if you like old survival horror. It's on par with RE: 1-3.****Game looks really cool.Its just a shame that no settings adjustment, compatibility mode tweak, or CURSEs directed at steam for selling games that won't run will make this game run.Third game in a row Iv'e bought from steam that absolutely will not run."
