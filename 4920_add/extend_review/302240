But what Call of Duty has never done before is giving us the same game in less than a year. And that is what the developers of 'Chernobyl Commando' have done.http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skops/recommended/302250/Above is my review of Manhunter, and practically everything I said in that review applies here. Weapons (except for one), sounds, music, Enemies/NPC's, animations, and length are all exactly the same. This is one of the most blatant examples of reusing assets in any game I've ever seen!All the negatives aside, if I were to pick which one is better, 'Chernobyl Commando' is my choice between the two. It has an actual story and an ending to that story. Easily the best part of the game is the setting of Chernobyl and they actually did a good job of how it looks. Run ' n gun segments are broken up with sniping or turret sections. It's still repetitious and practically every level has a turret section where you mow down 100 enemies within a few minutes.Is this a good game? Not even the slightest. But Chernobyl Commando does have some charm to it, and in a few places you can tell someone gave a damn when they made this thing. I still wouldn't recommend it to anyone though, the flaws far outweigh the few positives."

The driver didnt die, the truck didnt blow up, not even a mark on the windshield. So the truck hit me and just drove on and i took no damage so i pulled out my pistol and took one shot at the machine gunner in the leg with a pistol and he die and flipped off the truck and the driver just kept on his adventure. I am not impressed. This game is not the worst ive played but atleast the worst game i've ever played similar to this one you could atleast shoot through a windshield. Theres alot of things i could say in depth about how poorly designed this game is, not being able to shoot through the window of a vehicle comming at you is the worst."
,Recommended,302240,10375401,"Posted: 6 June, 2014",all,Fear57,"There was a time when games were games and not six hours of cutscenes or spiced up with huge special lighting or explosion effects, it was a magical time, a time I like to call 2000. Over the years games are trying to be more on Direct X versions and cutscene length along with how much story to cram in. There was a time when games did not do that, you played, there were one or two cutscenes and the story was on the back of the CD case or box. Voice actors where not actors, just voices for characters and f*ck was not said every other scentance in an M rated game.Chernobyl Commando is just what it sounds like, the usual terrorist plot and you stop them. Gameplay is just as it sounds. Go to Point A while shooting everything that moves then repeat going to Point B. There are no Ragdolls or Ragdoll physics just simple plain (yet effective) laid out objects. There are no special effects, there are no special exclusive lighting effects and there are no DLC specials, just a pure game that leaves you, basic graphics and settings and your imagination to fill in the rest.It's $10 ($5 now untill sale ends,) it's an Indie game developer, it's less then 5,000 megabytes, and it is pure linear unmodernized FPS arcade action and best of all, it's more then 40 minutes in length, (time ranges depending on how fast you are and difficulty from 90 minutes to 3 hours.) It's a throwback to early 2000's for how games where made then and now. Some people call this ""shovelware."" I call it a budget game that offers more then I thought it would and a game at its basic simple form. It is proof you do not need graphics, sounds or complex stories to have fun. Look for a demo, gameplay videos and the screenshots before purchase because as said before alot of people will not want to pick this up just because it is made so simple and basic."

You start the game out as a 'Chernobyl Commando' I presume....and you are tasked with shooting people. Who they are and what they want really isn't clear....but I start blasting away. You have an assortment of weapons right from the get go. A pistol....what looks like an AK-47 with a scope....and two other scoped rifles. You can also walk over enemy corpses to retrieve their weapons....but they mostly all handle the same. The first enemy soldier that opened fire on me.....I couldn't even hit him with one of the sniper rifles....and I had to let my AI partner (who I nicknamed Krazy Ivan Drago Esquire) to take him out. So needless to say....pinpoint accuracy this game has none of. The graphics are servicable. Not good or bad....but they do seem like they are run through some kind of grainy filter first. The first mission was easy enough....especially since you have that regenerating health that is all the rage these days. But by the time the second mission booted up....the game fell apart. Quite literally actually. First off.....I couldn't move anywhere. All I could do was wobble in place a little. Second....there was an AK-47 floating like a discarded newspaper in the wind. It might've been my AI partner's unmapped body....but I'll never know. So after that....I exited the game and quickly unistalled this POS.

,Not Recommended,302240,13771248,"Posted: 1 January, 2015",all,Bionicman,"If only there were a middle ground between ""recommend"" and ""don't"".Another samey low budget shooter from a small-scale independent polish developer named Silden.If you've played Manhunter (inexplicably renamed from its original title: Sniper: The Manhunter. Maybe too similar to City Interactive's many many ""Sniper: [whatever]"" games?) you'll notice a ton of reused assets to the point of absurdity. All the guns from Manhunter are there with only the arm textures changed, with one exception: The AK looking gun with the white camo and scope. While in Manhunter this had a 30 round mag and was essentially the best gun in the game, here it has only 10 rounds, the accuracy of someone with severe parkinsons holding a pistol gangster style, and takes many more bullets to do anything.The sniping mechanics have been dropped (steady aiming, getting the ""this is where your shot lands"" dot, wind & bullet drop) and there's not much reason for there being 3-4 sniper rifles(!) in your inventory at the same time. The Dragunov becomes the best weapon in the game since it's got a faster fire rate than the suppresed AWP-like and is the most accurate shooter in the game, though the Barret you get when you leave the titular location (more on that later) may also count. So you're mostly left with the suppresed Walther P99 (technically your best non-sniper weapon, believe it or not), the AK-(47? 74? M? whatever) that's a disgrace to the AK in accuracy AND power, and the MP7 to deal with your absurd collection of soldiers (in very different armors), civilians with guns, gas mask dudes, and later turban dudes.For about half the game, you get to ""explore"" (read: stay along a narrow linear path with no markers and make sure you simultaneously hit every star waypoint the way they intend you to and don't stray from the path or you'll be punished) the place listed in the title: Chernobyl NPP area. Expect this to involve ""go to this place, shoot 50 dudes that show up out of nowhere, sometimes visibly spawning in, then do some stationary or mobile turret sections where 50 more dudes will show up, repeat"". The one change-up here is later in this section some more heavily armored guys show up that take even more shots (that will miss most of the time) to put down.For the second half, due to a vague statement or two (there's more story in the ""About This Game"" section on steam than in the game as a whole; most dialogue is basically ""there are enemies ahead be careful, time to be serious, let's go"")  you're in... Iraq, shooting terrorists in plain clothes that do much more damage than anybody in the Chernobyl area despite having the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons and less armor. Many fewer turret sections thankfully, this time mostly on hummers with much more accurate guns.When you finish the game, you're treated to a long cutscene where you and your driver are invisible (seriously? There's very clearly a world model for ""you"" considering the main menu, and there's no reason the driver shouldn't be there) and the credits roll... and the game just closes when the credits hit the end. Like it became self aware and just gave up on existing. The AI, animations, and mission scripting are exactly the same as in Manhunter; not worth really mentioning.Visually, it's a slight improvement from prior Silden titles I guess? I mean, some models look like they're pretty surprisingly high-poly for a game with no AA options, but shadowmap resolution is still (estimating) like 256 and the draw distance for them is just as bad.Time for the real fun: The bugs. Much like Manhunter, you will occasionally need to restart your game after moving to the next level because the game will drop the framerate to unplayably slow, which can cause some hilarity if the level starts in a vehicle. It's even worse when going to the SECOND LEVEL, as the silos and buildings in the area? They all turn into some weird set of flat black rectangles.In general it can be fun to run through in 2 hours on easy mode after dropping less money on it in a sale than what a fast food meal will cost you. Maybe someday Silden will get enough cash and attention to join modern City Interactive and Techland in the ranks of Polish developers that have the resources to make a much better title."

In particular, I really like the aesthetics. It does a fantastic job recreating what I imagine the post-fallout Chernobyl region must look like, (I've never been there). It gives off a neat atmosphere. The controls are good and the game is a lot of fun with a good variety of weapons. The hit detection is pretty bad, but I suspect that this was intentional because the developers were trying to recreate the feel of firing inaccurate weapons that perhaps were not zeroed in. I say this because I find it hard to believe that they would intentional program a FPS with hit detection this bad. It does not however take away from the fun of the game, (in my opinion anyway). The one glaring flaw that this game has is that the developers felt it necessary to include a a turret gun portion in EVERY SINGLE LEVEL! To me, this greatly reduces the enjoyability of the game. This game needed two turret sections tops. Having one in every level where you are completely immobilized and completely unable to dodge the bullets being shot at you is excessive. Fortunately they were relatively short. I don't think I would pay the full price tag of ten dollars for this, but for the five dollar sale price I got it at, it was perfect and I recommend it."

The voice acting and musical cues are great. The scenarios you find yourself in are unique and groovy.You start the game with four guns: An AK47 with a 10 round magazine and a scope that shoots semi-auto with bad accuracy, an AK47 with a scope with a 10 round magazine that's bolt action and has high accuracy, a silenced AWP that has bad accuracy and low damage, and a silenced P99 handgun. You'll quickly find an MP7 and regular automatic AK-47, so the weapon situation is nice and varied.My favorite part of the game so far was when my framerate dropped from 60 FPS to 2, maxing out at 4. I played like that for over an hour, and when I restarted the program, the game was back at 60 FPS, so it kinda has a L4D dynamic gameplay thing going on, which is cool.There are plenty of useful settings, too. For instance, in the video settings area, there's a checkbox that just says ""Birds"". Since I love birds, I keep them enabled at all times, even though it might make me lag.I bought it for $0.99, but even at its regular price of $9.99, it's a steal!
