,Not Recommended,302250,12287687,"Posted: 29 September, 2014",all,Skops,"Developed by the Polish Studio 'Silden', Manhunter (or Sniper: The Manhunter) is a run 'n gun FPS game that I feel is misplaced on the PC platform. If this were something that I played on a tablet, I feel it would be a passable game! With the limited power of Ipads (or god forbid, a Blackberry Playbook) I might even go so far as to say the game looks pretty decent and is an overall good package... BUT I'm not reviewing a tablet FPS game, this is a PC FPS game and whats here is an extremely repetitive, poorly optimized, uninspired mess of a game.- Presentation: Graphically, I've seen worse. If you look at the screenshots you might catch yourself thinking it doesn't look half bad. That is because you haven't seen the game in motion. I admit, my 3 year old PC is far from a beast but I can still run Battlefield 4 on High at 50fps, meanwhile the FAR LESS graphically intensive Manhunter here struggles to stay at a consistent 30fps and has enough head bobbing to simutaniously give me a headache and motion sickness.- Animations: There is barely any. When switching weapons blink in and out and all making the same noise as the reload sound. Enemies/NPCs don't even have walking animations, everybody just jogs everywhere in the same fashion and sometimes in sync. Speaking of in sync, the grass that is scattered everywhere all move in a counter clockwise motion in complete syncronization and it looks REALLY WEIRD.- Sound: Weapons sound weak, they all sound exactly the same when reloading. The 'Combat Music' is not mixed at all; it hard cuts in, it hard cuts out. It even hard cut loops back to the beginning of the 12 second track if you stay in danger long enough. There 3 total ""Combat Music"" tracks , they suck, and you will hear them over and over, and over again. I eventually just turned on the Syphon Filter Omega Strain OST and continued playing, it was leaps and bounds better than the crap they had here.- Content: As far as I have seen, there is an abysmal 7 total weapons in the game (and thats including the knife, and grenades). You will be using the SMG, AK-47, and the sniper rifle for 98% of the game. There are some bits where you will use the .50 Barrett Rifle to take out a vehicle. There are 5 Chapters in the story, and 14 levels that fill out those chapters. It will likely take anyone, at maximum, a mere 2 hrs to completely get through the whole game. TWO. HOURS. MAXIMUM. There is no co-op or competitive multiplayer.- Story: There is literally no story here, just contract missions. Only two of the five chapters are connected in any way, and even then the resolution of that is unknown.- OVERALL: Manhunter is just a waste of time. It doesn't have anything good to show you, listen to, and no story to be had. I can't even recommend it as a 'so bad it's good' kind of game because there are worse games that try harder, cheaper, and most of all have some kind of a soul to them.Should ANYONE at all get curious in this game, wait until the price is $1.25 or lower to buy it."

I'm not sure if it was a student project or just a really underfunded studio, but this game probably shouldn't have been released. It's not fun, the story is mediocre, and the AI is among the worst I've ever seen. As fas as I can gather, this game is about a Merc-wannabe and his useless sidekick that manage to botch the jobs they accept. Levels are generally just plowing headlong into enemies until there aren't anymore enemies, then finding more enemies to make fewer of... It asks you to stealth some parts, but I'm not sure stealth is an actual option. The enemies tend to just know you're there, so they poke their heads out and wait for you to either make them fall over, or you fall over yourself. There's no excitement at all anywhere.Also, the birds are broken. Instead of flying, birds are stuck in one spot in the air. I don't know how hard it is to program birds, but I wouldn't have thought it was this difficult.Just avoid this game. Save your money for something else."
,Not Recommended,302250,32891033,Posted: 27 June,all,c5,"Lately I've been burning through a lot of shorter games, and I've found myself finding surprising enjoyment from lower-rated games like Kane & Lynch 2 or Rogue Warrior, which suffered in ratings for their lack of originality and length, but nonetheless provide competent, albeit basic  shooter campaigns to go through in a day. I went into Manhunter expecting something similar, a short, but passable FPS to keep me busy for about a day. Manhunter came close to filling that itch, but was ultimately too inept to really scratch it.Manhunter is glitchy and makes pretty poor design choices. You can definitely play it through to the end, this isn't as bad as your typical Unity asset flips, but most levels seem to have at least one egregious problem that drags it down:* On the first level, you have to escort a guy out of town, but he keeps walking infront of your fire, which causes an instant fail.* On another level, you have to plant two bombs, when you plan thte second bomb, the game doesn't seem to register that you planted it. I left the plant site only to notice the game still wanted me to plant it. I went back to the spot and it finally triggered the objective. This seemed to happen on every attempt.* At one point, you exit a tunnel and are instructed to go towards a base. When you go toward it though, the game tells you that you are leaving the designated zone. I eventually went back to the tunnel I came out of and went back toward the base again, and only then did the game spawn the enemies and allow me to continue. This happened every time and threw me for a loop far longer than it should have.* In that same level, you have to climb up a very long ladder to access a control panel to stop a missile launch. Just getting up the ladder is a trial, as taking even a single hit knocks you off the ladder. After meticulously killing every enemy, I finally made it up the ladder after 2 or 3 tries (and this is a timed task as the missile is about to launch). Somehow I fell inside the rocket itself and ended up under the level, unable to move. Needless to say, I was displeased given the effort it took to get there.* The final level is just a slog. You're forced to go through a series of almost identical, extremely dark, very linear caves. It's boring and the game pours in at least two waves of enemies into each major arena in this level, several people are shooting you at once from several directions at once, so you really just have to camp and clear people as they come in.All of this is a real shame, because when the game wasn't suffering these issues, I was actually having some fun. The combat is unbalanced, and it does like to just pour in a ton of guys at once, but in several moments barring the final level, it's kind of entertaining in a silly way. Enemies are as dumb as bricks and largely stand in one spot, making for easy headshots, and they like to clump together, which is convenient for a grenade toss. Combat is unbalanced, largely in your favor, as your health regenerates in a second or two, and every weapon oneshots on a headshot, and one or two of the sniper rifles are oneshots for any part of the body. One weapon is a semi automatic sniper rifle, which means you can headshot a bunch of guys at once, and since you have a crosshair even when not scoped in, which means it's comically easy to just quickscope or even noscope enemies even in close quarters. They also attempt to do the Max Payne thing of having a flashy killcam for when you kill the last guy in the room, which ends up being really funny when combined with the janky models and animation.At it's best, the game is hilarious shooting gallery when the designers aren't being cheap and just spawning dudes around you. When the game does resort to this, you basically have to turtle because the sheer volume of guys shooting at you can take you down surprisingly quickly. I was initially tempted to give this a thumbs up for the so-bad-its-good value, but as the game went on, the technical issues turned to frustrations. There are smaller bugs, such as birds just randomly freezing or guys spawning infront of you from nothing, and those are fine because they aren't super detrimental to gameplay, but the other issues made this more of a frustrating game to go through.Visually, this game is a bit of a mystery. Steam says this came out in 2013, but the loading screen says ""anniversary edition"", and the game looks like it came out around 2006 or 2007. If this is actually an older game, I do think the environments largely looked pretty good for something of that age, and I liked that they were actually fairly colorful, a rarity in the military FPS genre. The levels set at dawn in particular were ncie to look at. The character models are pretty poor, but I think the environment artists definitely put in effort and were fairly talented. At the very least, I think they cared more than the programming and QA departments.Short, cheap games that aren't super original do have a place in the world as nice filler to play between longer, more demanding games. I don't need a great story or the most innovative gameplay to have fun (I didn't even mention story because it's basically nonexistant) so long as the basic game is a competent version of gameplay I already like, but Manhunter falls just below that basic level of fast-food gaming for me to really reccomend."

,Not Recommended,302250,11624410,"Posted: 9 August, 2014",all,kschang77,"SUMMARY: Manhunter, previously known as ""Sniper: the Manhunter"" is a game featuring a mercenary who will take out targets if he deemed they are worth killing. However, sometimes he's just a pawn in the mess. The game felt as if it's an old game designed 8 years ago (circa 2006 or so) albeit updated to modern graphics, where you are basically Rambo that will mow down everybody in his way, using long guns, assault rifles, and even pistols, shooting down generic enemies in various interesting locations.  At the end, there are better FPS that are worth your money.I am seeing a lot of people confusing this with the old Sierra ""Manhunter"" franchise. This has NOTHING to do with that. This is basically one guy shooting bazillion bad guys FPS, sort of Modern Warfare without the cut scenes, QT events, or ""AI Teammates"" to get in your way. However, no multiplayer either.As typical in FPSs back then, you carry a veritable arsenal... Two sniper rifles, pistol, then as you encounter them, AK-47 assault rifles and  PDW submachine guns. The pistol and your primary sniper rifle are suppressed, but not silenced, so you can be discovered while using it. And most enemies require multiple taps on a single target except the primary sniper rifle and the .50 cal sniper rifle.   No shotgun here.The game basically has you fight your way into the objective, to setup a sniper nest or to simply clear the area and achieve the objective, which is, often, snipe a high-value target, and sometimes, to rescue one. Your only link to outside is ""Max"" your handler who through wonders of technology, will provide you some guidance.At least the locations are somewhat exotic. I haven't seen any levels set in what's allegedly Moscow (though it looks generic enough), or the Baikinour Cosmodrome (probably NOT accurate).Enemies are generic and really reminds me of old Lithtech games like ""Marine Sharpshooter"". They don't really flank, but more like ran back and forth at range, with occasionally rushes but the level is typically wide enough that you can find cover and backup around the corner and keep trying.There are various talk about stealth, but in reality you can just kill everybody you need to. There's no health meter, as your health auto-regenerate, at least on easy level. If you hide behind sometime and stop taking hits you'll recover in a few seconds. It's when you take hits non-stop that you will die.While the level appears to be wide open, there are serious boundaries that you will not cross, or a huge timer will start counting down where you have 10 seconds to get back to the ""proper"" area or the mission fails. There are also various houses, walls, and such that limits your movement. And that gets really annoying.All in all, this game is worth merely a few dollars, no more. It's a quick distraction budget title, don't expect too much. You can probably find better shooters even at this low pricepoint."

Most of them were poorly made....but they still had a certain charm to them....kind of like all of the killer shark movies that the 'SyFy' channel has begun to crank out on a yearly basis. The games were very basic....but they worked....which is more than ""Manhunter"" can claim. When you start the first mission....there is some spoken dialogue that is supposed to give you some insight into what you are supposed to be doing....but there is some sh***y Iranian orchestra music blaring which drowns everything else out. You start off in a helicopter and are supposed to be sniping some targets from the air....but good luck with that. But at least you seem to be invulnerable while in the air....'cause I kept getting shot over an over and nothing happened. After a couple of minutes of this bullsh**....the helicopter finally lands and as soon as your feet touch the ground....you will know just how broken the game actually is. First up....the walking. Your character walks like he is riding a pi**ed off bull....and you have to somehow hold on for eight seconds.  More annoying than that.....is the jumping. This game has the exact same gravity as The Moon. You can jump high and float in the air for several seconds. Want to jump rooftop to rooftop? Well guess what....you can. Just keep in mind that if you cross any invisible barriers in your travels....the game will give you a few seconds to get back before it makes you start all over. Which is something that you may have to do often.....since when I followed my A.I. teammate towards a hill.....the game demanded that I stay on track....before ultimately informing me that I failed the mission. The music is terrible and can not be turned off. Sure.....there is an option to do so in the main menu....but it doesn't work. The weapon selection is bewildering to say the least. You start the first mission with a silenced pistol....a sniper rifle....and um.....another sniper rifle. You can pick up AK-47's from enemy soldiers....which kind of made me feel like the Doom Marine for a second....since that was pretty much the last time that I remembered carrying a huge surplus of weapons in a FPS.

They don't work, check task manager, the game froze.. I've played games before.. Then there's this, it's like a cheap tablet game that you can get on the App Store or Google Play for roughly the same price, in fact it feels like a port from a tablet game, which is why it's so horrible, plot is weak, no actually backstory, I literally couldn't get far because the game was just pure bad design, I restarted the game after the crash, and the continue from last save sort of option was not available.

It does have cutscenes after you get intel on the latest missions and after you kill the last guy in that area of the map.

Yes it is a run and gun shooter, however it still has a good and believeable story line to it.The graphics are really not that bad and it runs quite smooth on my machine, again remember you are only paying $5.60 Canadian dollars for this game.It reminds me of ""I'M GOING IN"" with the character ""Davy Jones""  (the original first one-which was the best one). The guns are realistic and work (react) just like they do in real life,My computer specs are: Windows 7 Professional (64 Bit-Service Pack 1), Intel Core i7-4770K, CPU @ 3.50 GHz, Dual Quad Core, 16 Gigs of DDR-3 RAM, GeForce GTX 770 (Memory-2048 MB - GDDR5), Sound Blaster ZxR Sound Card.It is not the best or most modern FPS out there graphic wise, but to tell you the truth it is most certainly not the worse either. However, for the price it is a pretty good game, really fun to play and not as short as some people have been saying. It is actually quite long with lots of twists and turns.Would I recommend that people buy this game, YES I would definitely recommend that people buy this game even though it is not the best FPS available, it is still lots of fun.I hope this helps some people when they are trying to decide whether they should spend $5.60 Canadian dollars for this game or not.Take Care & Stay Safe,CANADA:-)"

It has a few technological handicaps and feels kind of unfinished in some areas (like music arrggg) but for its price is a very good deal and, except by the mission in which you walk alongside this awful ally, it´s a quite alright run and gun game in which you get to visit a large variety of environments. Don´t expect miracles but if you are into indie games/mods this can be good fun."

,Not Recommended,302250,16909582,"Posted: 6 July, 2015",all,Halcyon,"Manhunter reminded me of those bundles you would find in software stores during the early-to-mid 2000's featuring one decent title and several awful ones.  They'd usually be called ""Action Pack"" or something like that.  These would almost invariably contain at least one buggy shooter from a tiny Russian or eastern European developer.  I felt a twinge of nostalgia as I slogged through Manhunter's ultra-repetetive gameplay, its head-scratching narrative, its weak level design, its 2004-era graphics, its sometimes-brutal checkpointing, its laughable sound effects, its broken stealth scenes, its intolerably long load times, its slew of bugs of all possible kinds and its overall unfinished feel.  Manfunter is just plain bad, bad, BAD."

(Probably just me though)-Graphics/Animations are laughable.-Poorly made and occasionally glitchy.-Not very clear on where you are supposed to go and you get penalized for straying even a bit off the main path.Over all it's a pretty bad game.

,Not Recommended,302250,15530134,"Posted: 24 April, 2015",all,Erminator,"Where do I begin...You play as the protagonist, Max. Max is your stereotypical video game soldier with an australian accent. The voice acting is monotone and emotionless. Speaking of characters, in cutscenes the characters waddle like they have been holding a gran caca for several months. The pelvis doesn't even move. And the arms stay bent, and move back in forward ever so slowly.As for the gameplay. If you are killed and restart the dialogue starts up before the game loads. Combat is wonky. A pistol is even better than an AK47. Also, for some parts of the game you can sprint, and as you sprint the enemies spawn and won't attack until they run to their scripted spawn. You can literally run straight up to them and knife them. And speaking of sprinting; your character can sprint for about 3 seconds (if that), and will then proceed to pant and heave like a group of apathetic middle schoolers forced to run the mile in P.E. Wait another 5-7 seconds and you can sprint again. Here's a positive: you never need to worry about knowing if you killed all the enemies, because as they spawn in cheap garage band rock- may I add in looping (not kidding, you can hear the break inbetween the loops - will start playing, and once all of them die it will stop. So you run up, music spawns, kill 3 enemies, music stops, turn a corner and the cycle repeats. Another fun fact is that it took a whole clip of AK47 ammo to blow up 1- I repeat, ONE- red/explosive barrel. To make matters worse you are given unskippable cutscenes with bland, overly-generic/sterotypical military dialogue.So I finished the first mission (so I believe) and at the end (SPOILER- though not really b/c it affects the game in no way whatsoever) the person you supposed to find is dead. And in an emotionless, australian accent Max says ""He's dead. We were too late."" Meanwhile your NPC ally is outside, and replies ""I found a map."" You go out to see him staring into the distance, no map around, no objective around, nothing. After 1 minute of looking for a stupid map or trigger to continue the game, I gave up.If you already bought this game, I say in the words of the legendary, unique, unforgetable Max's words ""I was too late.""I bought this on sale, it was around $.50-$1.50. Wait for the sale. It will probably come when steam puts on random sales/non-big games."
