Under a Killing Moon made quite a racket at the time, being one of the first games that used FMV, and not just for cut-scenes but also in-game, and for being so unprecedently huge (it shipped on 4 CDs). This was cutting edge stuff back then, when some games were still shipped on several floppy disks... And than this mammoth came!Anyway, technologies aside the game turned out to be really interesting and clever. I spent lots of days and nights playing it (I was 14 and had zero experience in computer adventure games at the time) but in the end I made it, although I used hints several times. I've been hooked on point-n-click adventure games ever since.Frankly, I bought this game several days ago more out of nostalgia than anything else. I thought I would play an hour or so, remember the good ol' days, so to speak, and be on my way. Well, what do you know, I spent the night playing it and I'm now roughly half-way through, fully intended on finishing it.My next step would probably be Tex Murphy: The Pandora Directive, which I haven't played at the time of its release due to some compatibility issues. Better late than never."

You are a private detective down on his luck, looking for a break.But boy oh boy i dont think u would expect this much trouble & drama! I won't reveal any more of the story so i dont spoil the game, but i will say this game is just awesome, with very good classic graphics, great story and amazing 3d inter active interface system.The only small bad thing i can say about this game is it runs on Dosbox, it doesnt run on Windows 7 or Windows 8 natively."

Remember to take notes and save regularly.  The ""controls"" take some getting used to but then it's all fun!"
,Recommended,302350,13144195,"Posted: 29 November, 2014",all,diet orange voodoo,"""Under A Killing Moon"" is the third game in the Tex Murphy series and is a 3D First Person Point & Click Adventure with bits of Full Motion Video. The majority of the game takes place in the slums of a post-apocalyptic San Fransisco still in the midst of World War Three. After solving a petty burglary, Tex is tasked with recovering a countess' precious family heirloom, a bird statuette and must rely on his expert deductive skills (or lack there-of) to tackle this case head on.The game is full of camp (the good kind), but also portions of comedy and really good acting, which typically unheard of in a game of this manner. So it would be fair to call it one parts ""Sam & Max Hit The Road"" and one parts ""Myst"". The game's only downside is the 3D portions. Navigating around is akin to sliding on ice and most definitely takes some getting used to. But what makes it truly a cut above the rest is it's very intuitive ""hint"" system that throws you a mulligan if you get lost (you earn points from conversations, getting clues, and solving puzzles and use them as you please).Overall, it's a great game that's an absolute must for fans of old school computer games and point & click adventures alike"

One of the original noir detective stories, and a classic! Even on this date, the game has not aged to a point of being unplayable, and therefore, is a timeless classic.For those who have played it as kids, this is a re-run worth doing over!For those who havent played this game, I believe it is worth it for the experience of one of the original classics!"

Although Overseer is my personal favorite, UaKM is really great too.Pros:1. The story.2. The suave main character.3. The one-of-a-kind world.4. Hilarious humor.Cons:1. If you're not an old-timer, a hipster, or just a fan of old games - everything. Seriously, I wouldn't be surprised if casual gamers wouldn't even know how to play it."

Puzzles are pretty obvious but the story and characters are great. Love Tex Murphy stuff, you'll love this. I only wish I'd discovered these games earlier, my first was Tesla Effect."
