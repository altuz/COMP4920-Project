The publisher doesn't care for fixing it, instead they just gave out a save game for download that puts you at some place behind the broken part so you miss an important part of the story.They show on the shop page screenshots of the HD iOS version, while the PC version they actually sell here still looks exactly like the original game from 2001. Also I didn't see anything about this alleged ""Updates in this new version of Necronomicon"".Normal thinking people would call this version of that game simply a fraud and Valve shouldn't allow to sell it on Steam.Better just watch a Let's Play of it (of the original disc version) instead of wasting any money.Update: I've found a fix for the problem with the missing video sequences and the missing briefcase, check outthis forum postfor more information. Buy the game if you really want to and know how to two juggle with two files (wich is really not that dificult actually).My rating stays the same as there is still no official fix, although it's actually that simple. Also the problem with the technically seen faked screenshots and the missing addtional content stays that way too."

Thats how strongly I feel about this. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FINISH IT.It would be a great game if1. You could actually finish it.2. the cut scenes that are important to the plot acutally worked3. there were meaningful clues to what you need to do next.4. YOU COULD ACTUALLY FINISH IT!You know what you should do? Buy a game called Darkness Within: Pursuit of Loath Nolder  (and theres a part 2 as well)those 2 games are exactly what you expect from a Lovecraft point and click adventure. THIS GAME IS A RIP-OFF.Whats that? You've seen videos on youtube that look decent? Well, thats because those videos are showing you the half-way decent Playstation version of the game.I am a veteran of the horror point/click genre. I enjoy solving obscure puzzles and thinking about the game for hours and hours.. i had to use UHS walkthrough and eventually youtube videos just to get to the part of the game where... uh.. you CAN'T FINISH IT.So don't waste your money. Its a pity b/c there is a real potential here, if you could acutally finish the game, and the cutscenes were put back in it would be ""ok"".I hope this helps."

I like this game.(optional let's play footage)http://youtu.be/tOe1b9xBr5gOkay it is from 2001. But for a game that old I was really surprised by the presentation. It uses 2D images which appear to have been pre-rendered in 3D. I thought scenes would comprise of 2D landscape environments with 3D character and objects rendered over them. But the game is actually played from a first person perspective. You don't navigate a 3D environment like a modern (or even an old one) FPS. You move from one location to another i.e. different places in a room or the town and have different 2D panoramic views at each location. It's basically works like google earth street view where you can look all around from specific point. I guess this was the developers way of implementing the game that would run on the typical sytems that were available at the time. I'm not saying it's the best looking thing ever but I was impressed, I was expecting a lot worse. Yes the game runs in only 640 by 480 resolution so it's a pretty pixely. That didn't actually bother me But I've been playing games for over 20 years now haha. And you might think that some of the locations look pretty drab i.e. a town full of ugly brown wooden shacks and mud but it's typical of anything based on Lovecraft. I didn't mind the sound effects either, I like the creaking you could hear in your home while you were alone. The voice acting is mixed, some I felt was good other examples a bit lame but that just made it more amusing lol. It also has the occasional animated cut scene e.g. when you answer the door and speak to a visitor or approach a person on the street.You can interact with certain objects and individuals you come across as well as picking up inventory items. Theres no tutorial or tips so you just have figure how to do things yourself. There's no journal or log to refer to for important information you have found or what your current objective is. There is no autosave, I think need to manually save using the menu.Not surprisingly being such an old game it has a few little issues. Not that these stopped enjoying it, but here are some of them. You need to wave the cursor around around the in order find things that you are able to interact with because unless it's really obvious there is no indication. The way you interact with you inventory actually and actually use items is a bit unclear. If you are able to take use an item seems to be completely situational. But it's doesn't prompt when you can't use an object when click on it in your inventory instead just exits your inventory. I found that if you are in the right the item will on appear on your cursor if you click on it in your inventory. Next you probably really need to be paying attention to dialogue and remember what is said in conversations so that you know what to do next. Otherwise you find yourself a bit lost. I was knocking on every door in town and wondering why the hell I was doing that lol. Unfortunately I hadn't saved the game before I died so without an autosave I lost progress. So yeah, save your game.I love Lovecraft and this is better than I thought it would be so far. The 2D panoramic view was a pleasant surprise. I think there would be plenty of people who might enjoy this especially if they like Lovecraft stuff as well.Clickherefor more let’s play videos =)"
,Not Recommended,302390,19101958,"Posted: 15 November, 2015",all,Faudraline,"I am genuinely baffled by my conflicting feelings over this ""Lovecraftian"" adventure game. Okay,Necronomicon: The Dawning of Darknessis nothing miraculous. It's old, it's clunky, full of bugs with irritable animations... yet still manages to set an eerie enough atmosphere to drive your perception skills to its limits. For that account only, it is not possible to recommend this game to anyone. Even if one is to set aside the fact that the game is raddled with bugs, it would still be an acquired taste forced down your throat.It's year 1927 in rickety village of Pawtuxet, Rhode Island. A silent afternoon is abruptly interrupted for young William Stanton by his friend, Edgar Wycherley. Edgar seems off, panicked and fearful. He entrusts William an odd pyramid shaped relic and asks for him to protect it, even from Edgar himself at all costs. Then, Edgar takes off as oddly as he appeared before William's door. Minutes later, Doctor Egleton, Wycherley's family doctor visits William to inform that Edgar hasn't been himself lately, consumed by his studies of archeology and asks William to inform him immediately if Edgar is to be contacted. After these strange visits, William decides to visit Edgar himself and learn more about these ""studies"" of Edgar's in hopes of aiding his friend. That's how young and avid William Stanton gets himself into an interplanar mess centering a quite specific book of occult: Necronomicon.So far, so good. The story is interesting to begin with, weaved with mummies, strange disappearances, long deceased ancestors, sigils and summoning of spirits. Yet is the presentation of the story fulfilling and satisfying as the game progresses? That, I'd like to vote as abstaining. There is a great amount of lore thrown around for us to monitor and take note, but they are not processed as elegantly as possible in my opinion. Anecdotes keep coming to us without any time for us to digest any kind of on-goings. On that part, it is bad construction for a story revelation.The game hailing from 2001, graphics are nothing extraordinary, a bit clucky and plastic even for character models. Aside oddly shaped characters, the basic environment presents a creepy yet dull atmosphere suitable for any gothic setting, yet it doesn't actually deliver the Lovecraftian elegance that one would be waiting. Voice acting is neat, with accents of the original time period, but without the option of a subtitle, and much information for you to pursue hidden in cinematic dialogues - without an option to record spoken information in game - ends up being a complete obstacle for progression. You have to play this game with pen and paper + earphones if you'd like to make something out of the story.We are already used to the linear gameplay for an adventure game, butNecronomicon: The Dawning of Darknesstakes this part a bit more seriously than it should. One of the main problems for this game, if you ask me, is that you are expected to complete one solemn action at a time, and unless you discover and accomplish that specific action, nothing progresses. You are allowed to explore on your own; it just won't do any good. That's why everything turns into an ""action hunt"" on a wide map for you to figure out quickly.Puzzles are another issue altogether. They are quite obscure even with the collectible information, asking you to run through a series of spiritual and occult references - most of them are authentic, by the way: kudos on that part - to figure out your next step. They are never easy and demand that you take notes in every step of your game. I'd love that if the lore that we use for puzzles would be at least somewhat relevant to the plotline that we are pursuing... It is mostly not. Oh, and remember ""Old Ones"" concept that we were so excited about, because, I don't know, this is a LOVECRAFTIAN game? It really doesn't deliver at all.Combined with a series of common bugs that would make the game impossible to finish without an exe. copy of an old retail cd - it is possible to reach one in the guide section of community -Necronomicon: The Dawning of Darknessends up being a lame adventure game with some cool references thrown around. If you are a fan of Lovecraftian literature, sure, you can try. But even then, I'd doubt that you'd enjoy it much. I tried so hard to like this game but even as a Lovecraft fan myself, I sadly did not.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

This port is poorly done and sections of the story are missing.  The best cutscene in the game is cut out and you are thrust ahead in the story with no idea what just happened.  A game breaking bug makes the game impossible to complete a little later on when you can't access an important part of your inventory.  As of yet there has been no word on a potential patch of fix for these issues and because of this I cannot reccomend the game."

However, this game is the biggest brain suck I have ever come across and I felt the dying need to alert people to the waste of time and pennies they will experience if they buy this game. I could forgive the tired animations if it weren't for the dreadfully boring gameplay. As someone who is a big fan of adventure gaming, I am generally quite a patient person. However, this game forces you into such a linear pathway (only one action becomes available at any given time and you have to search through the game to find something that has become clickable) that I feel the problem solving has turned from an exercise of logic to a ""search for the button"" quest. Most actions that become executable wind up turning into a eyeball-tearingly long monolog from some dreadfully acted character that is supposed to advance the storyline but leaves you wondering where the heck the last half hour just went. Major fail guys, don't bother, even if you can get this game cheap."

The puzzles are challenging, and interesting. It is a great hommage to the style of lovecraft stories, and very enjoyable to play. It is certainly worth playing, and I'm glad that I have done so. I do think it's important to note this.That being said, the game is incompletable. As others has said there is a massive, leathal bug. A very large, and important cutscene, one that shapes the entire game, and gives the player direction in what to do next (as well as a huge part of the story, and reward for completing the puzzle which came before it) is missing. Also inventory issues, and not being able to access some items leaves the game incompletable from very close to the end.I do understand that meridian have offered their 'solution' which is to download a save game - which means still missing out on that long cutscene, as well as not completing a puzzle. Now that is no solution at all, it's basically a 'level skip cheat' It seems to be as though the developers really do not care about fixing this for the players.It's an honest shame, because while the game is enjoyable - I would really not recommend anyone buying it. At least not until the developers actually care enough to fix this bug - and it is a bug no matter how much they want to deny that.tl;dr: Don't buy this game until they have fixed the MAJOR errors in it.Otherwise is really is a great game."

I don't know how long it is but it's been fun so far. The only problem I have is with the dialogue... there are no subtitles and because of the accents some of the people are seriously hard to understand if you're hard of hearing or bad at slurred American accents  so it is advised that if you are about to talk to anybody SAVE your game. You might be able to figure some things out by logic or just clicking around but sometimes they do give you hints that save you time. It's a good practirse to save all the time anyway if not have multiple save files. PS - I loved the part with the guy that gets angry at you for ringing the doorbell. Naturally, I kept doing it to see how far the game dialogue would go and the guy bashed me to death haha. The graphics are pretty ordinary but it's probably to be expected for such an old game, and it's from a relatively unknown developer. Not that I'm the font of knowledge for devs but Anuman? Seems to be from France. Never heard of them until I downloaded this game."

I also enjoyed the music plus I am a huge fan of Lovecraft and anything (well almost anything) based on his writing. That said this game has some very cool 'Lovecraft"" moments and is based upon the story ""The Case of Charles Dexter Ward"". The game play  issues with the game are the problems towards the end where you cannot get an important piece from an alchemist set you find earlier in the game; it is EXTREMELY frustrating. Also it is point and click game with short cut aways. However with that said, I think people are being too hard on the game. If you have no experience in reading Lovecraft this probably is not the game for you. It is not especially violent or typical of most games that are popular right now, slow and lots of reading/puzzles but with a very well done creepy feel. It doesn't have super flashy graphics as only a few people actually designed and made it. But I still enjoyed it and was quite happy once the bug with the case was ammeliorated by using the link provided above in another review.

The detectoring work you have to do is word heavy and relies on you remembering specific facts and symbols, and there are a lot of options at one point in the game where if you don't choose properly you're basically screwed and have to start again (unless you've saved just before it happens, which you probably haven't). I haven't read the text it's based on, but it seems like an interesting enough story. While good to give it a go, it feels more like a 'warm up' from the dev team for making better games. **"

Some people are absolute inpatient at times"

There is one bug that may prevent you from finsihing the game. This is an old game and it is cheap, but if you can't finish it then it's not worth anything in my opinion."

Do not waste any time or money on it. If you need to just watch a walkthough on youtube or find the version of it and play on Original Playstation."

My I-7 Sandy Bridge at 3.8 GHz has been sufficient to date with demanding games but this is remarkable. I'm thinking along the lines of setting up massively parallel RISC chips as yet not designed, running an OS not yet writen, creating a virtual X86 Win7 machine running at 200+ GHz; an unfortunate side-effect of the configuration is that any and all video output will be converted to a nonstandard 425 × 600 16 colors, 12 FPS max. Well, if and when I get this rig running I might be back with a game review."
