,Recommended,302490,10237439,"Posted: 25 May, 2014",all,AbbydonPrime,"This is a decent time & resource management strategy game. Each of the 30 levels contains 2 or 3 timed sub-levels. The story was typical, but well-written. The game is not very difficult, so don't expect brain-bending challenges. There isn't much replayability unless you're going for all gold stars. It took me approximately 5 hours to complete the game, but that included pauses. If you really enjoy casual games like I do, it's worth the full price. Otherwise you might want to wait for a sale.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=263721771---For more...My Reviews||My casual gaming...Group|Curator Page"

Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. The visual and audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu.GameplayThere are two different game difficulty modes to choose from: Adventure and Heroic. Adventure mode is untimed and Heroic mode is timed.There are total of thirty levels in total but in each of these levels has sub-levels within them. Some of them has at least two to three sub-levels.The objective of this game is to complete given set of tasks before the time on the timer runs out. However, some tasks do require resources (food and/or woods) before they can be completed. Also, there're certain tasks that requires the help from certain characters in the game. All levels in the game can be replayed for better score.MiscellaneousThere are total of five different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.Final thoughts, I don't think that this game much of replay value to it. If you're into time management games then you might find this game somewhat enjoyable to certain extent. I don't recommend getting this game at full price.http://store.steampowered.com/app/302490"

Ballad of Solar is an epic of a pampered prince who is trying to save his girl from the evil's of a wizard. The gameplay consists of 2 or 3 maps per level. Each map is a static board that has roads leading to objectives. Each objective is blocked by trees and rocks and holes. You need to manage resources to preform the task of clearing each object. More simply put, you click stuff on the map to clear it, then you move on to the next map. It's nearly imposible to lose a level, the storyline is all but annoying, and the voice acting is horrendous. However, the game has just enough fun to keep you ocupied. I am an achievement hound; I don't normally play games unless there's some achievements to unlock. I played this game to the end despite that fact. I picked this title up for $2 and at that price it's well worth it. I definately recommend this to anyone who is in the mood for a casual playthrough that requires little to no effort."
,Recommended,302490,11343908,"Posted: 21 July, 2014",all,Necrovore,"While not at all what I had been expecting, Ballad of a Solar was an enjoyable game none the less.  There is just enough strategy involved to make even the easy difficulty require some planning to succeed instead of just clicking as often as you can.  The levels are also short enough to serve a nice distraction if you are just after something quick to casually goof around with.  The graphics are mostly still images, but well designed.  The plot is amusing and hits almost every cliche possible for the genre.  While I was hoping for a more sandbox style town builder, I enjoyed the game enough to not regret the purchase."
,Not Recommended,302490,13273586,"Posted: 7 December, 2014",all,Muir,"Brief SynopsisBallad of Solar is an extremely casual ""click everything until the level is finished"" game. It's labelled as a strategy game, but really there is little in the way of strategy here.In a nut shell, you travel from one level to the next. Each level has different goals to reach; once you've reached those goals you move on to the next level.Long ReviewStory: An evil sorceror has overthrown the kingdom and taken the princess captive. It's up to Solar (the princess's fiance) to restore the kingdom to its former glory and save the princess.Graphics: Each character is drawn really well in this game, with loads of personality attached to them.Music/Sounds: The music and sound effects are pretty good, though the voice acting is hilariously terrible. I'd almost recommend the game just because of the horrible voice acting (it's a great source of laughs), but I won't.Length: I've played this game for just over two hours and have reached level 19 in that length of time. It should be apparent that this is an extremely easy game, based on this information. However, I do not know how many levels there are in the game as I can not finish it due to a bug which keeps me from moving on to level 20.Replayability: Each level is scored by giving you stars. If you're a perfectionist (and aren't hit by the bug I've run into), then the game is replayable only to get full stars for each level. Other than that, it really isn't worth replaying.If it wasn't for the bug I managed to find, I would recommend this game to those of you who enjoy casual games. Because of this bug however, I'm going to have to give this game a thumbs down.If you want to take your chances, then wait until the game is at an extremely cheap price."
,Recommended,302490,28431185,"Posted: 17 December, 2016",all,Senno,"In the casual time management space, it is hard to be noticed. Games and series seemingly pop into stores at a moment notice, fully realised and ready to be enjoyed by a public who cannot get enough. Whole websites are devoted to these click based games, where the management of resources against a timer will provide a form of accomplishment which is only slightly belittling. For as much as they bring new gamers to the fold, time management games, at their very essence, are a little insulting as they demand so very little from the player. Rising above this is a balance between providing enough feedback and interaction for the player but to not overwhelm the casual audience that this genre naturally attracts. In this case, I believe Ballad of Solar has done a remarkable job.It helps that the game is very pleasing to the eye. I was surprised at the quality of the art and the animation, which was a little more ambitious than a game at this price point and genre have any right to be. From the set up and dismantlement of the tent for each level, to the conversations the characters have, even the movement of the workers you control to do your Prince’s bidding, graphically the game is really attractive. It has a charming cliché atmosphere that brings to mind all the great fairytales of yore but spins it with some fun character designs and interesting companions.In addition, the voice acting was really well done, with some great lines and actors who have really brought these characters to life. From the knight in shining armour to the hearty blacksmith and the giant oaf, these characters are fun caricatures of fairytale tropes exaggerated with a natural belief that you can’t help but go along with the ride. The dulcet tones of the Prince match sharp wit with the wizened Wizard and the oafish giant, who bring a lot of humour and character to their roles.Naturally, it is a cliché’ story of a Kingdom falling to ruin and a Prince who is on a quest to vanquish evil and save the damsel in distress, but this works to the games favour with a certain silliness that is endearing. The Big Bad has ousted you from your former Kingdom and you fall in with a cadre of companions who will help you along your way, each of whom it must be said, is more engaging than the last.The 30 levels will only provide even the most patient of gamers a few hours to complete, which is just enough time to get to know these characters and this story before it becomes to pretentious. Each level is split into several sub levels, and surprisingly, these sub-levels scroll to a new screen, a new and welcome effect. Snippets of conversation and the various posturing of the Big Bad and the Prince add a little flavour and make investing your time rewarding.The music is pleasing if ultimately forgettable. The main theme is repetitive and a little disarming and would be better if it punched through the quality of the effects and voice acting. As it is, it’s probably the weakest element of Ballad of Solar.There isn’t much in the way of challenge, and replayability is non-existent. But with that said, there’s hardly anything to fault with Ballad of Solar. It’s a fun time management game with above average visuals and sound that caters well to the crowd that will appreciate its me-too nuance. Well worth taking the journey.7.5/10."

Your only role into this game is to click on things in order for them to dissapear from the map. You click them, they dissapear, you get to the next level. And i'm not oversimplifying, that's the game. It's a dumbed down version of Farmville.Voice acting is silly. I don't know what the ""story"" is about, as i didn't had any pleasure into following it. Probably something with kings and mages.It's definetly a game made for phones/tablets and ported on PC. Can be ok for phone/tablet, for young kids."

,Recommended,302490,26687546,"Posted: 19 November, 2016",all,tvleavitt,"TL;DR: Simple, sweet way to while away a few hours without stress. Easy on the eyes and ears. Unquestionably worth sale price.Full review: Cute. Simple. Amusing. Very high quality production values: zero bugs, high quality art (if a bit cliched, the iron jawed male hero and impossibly thin female characters are a bit much) varying from merely competent to lush and lovely. The music is nothing spectacular, but fits the scenery and mood properly and isn't intrusive or boring. I happily let it play on through the whole game without becoming annoyed.I played the game through in a single evening on the lower difficulty ""Adventure Mode"" setting (several of the eight hours Steam recorded were where I walked away from the game for dinner and chatter with roommates), and found it exactly what I was looking for in terms of difficultly and engagement for a stress free evening. Every two or three levels, I screwed up the initial run through enough to restart, either part way through, or after finishing and being awarded a ""Silver"" star. Obtaining the desired ""Gold"" star required paying enough attention to what I was doing that I remained throughly immersed. This is definitely a ""casual"" game (at least in ""Adventure"" mode), suitable for youngun's or folks looking for to while away a few relaxed hours. The story, which is, yes, cheesy as heck, unfolds neatly as you go along, each level taking no more than a few minutes and leading neatly into the  next and the one after that.If you're ""hardcore"" or in the mood for a ""serious"" challenge leading to the occassional frustrated outburst, this isn't the game for you. I beat every level at the ""Gold"" star rank on my first or second try (although there were a couple of close calls with the latter). While there's probably zero replayablity--I, personally, have no impulse to go through it again on ""Heroic Mode"" (the higher level of difficulty)--that's not a big deal at the sale price of under $2 that I paid for it."

,Recommended,302490,12861293,"Posted: 9 November, 2014",all,RinaLavada,This was very cute. The gameplay reminds me of the kingdom for my princess series. The strategy aspect of trying to finish all your tasks before the time runs out is fun but there are no consequences for not making your time limits. It jjust gives you a silver star instead of a gold star. It's a very casual game. I would completely recommend it.

They also say BUT finishing every level perfectly takes some time, not true. The game is pretty nice and I personally decided to put the harder difficult on after finishing the first level. There were exactly 2 levels which I wasn't able to finish in time to get perfect result on first try.The game also repeats itself pretty hard and bringing some new character into the game now and then won't really do much difference. It's more or less hovering mouse over your screen and clicking stuff now and then without much planning.I would still recommend this game for right price because it's nicely implemented even though it's short and repeats itself. Graphics are nice and game runs smoothly without any problems. The current 7€ is maybe little too much for the game that you finish in couple hours and which have little or none replay value. But still, if you are less than casual player this game can be lot of fun."

I debated giving it a thumbs down but even though it's simplistic to the extreme it's not overly boring nor tedious.  Just click and move along.   Some of the screens are very busy and that is what will lead you to miss the pattern and thus you won't always earn all the gold stars.  But once you finish the scene it'll be so obvious that there's little incentive to go back and  redo the scene.Don't be fooled by the playing time as I left it up and running overnight so I could get the cards right away.  It's about 5-7 hours of game play with zero replay factor.For a couple of bucks and the cards, for those that want a brain dead extremely casual game you'll like it.
