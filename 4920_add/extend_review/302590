,Recommended,302590,29377746,Posted: 20 January,all,WTWR Zydrate,"Of Guards and Thieves is a competitive multiplayer stealth game, and you don't really see a lot of those around. Plenty of cooperative stealth but rarely does a game put you against other players. In fact, the best comparison is the “Spies vs Mercs” mode on Splinter Cell: Blacklist. Basically, if you liked that mode but found it to be too severe on the Call of Duty spectrum of gaming, then I have news for you!OGAT is the same idea but in a more indie/flash game type style. Makes sense, as many people who play it through Kongregate and aren’t even aware it’s on Steam.The core mechanics are simple; The Guards tend to be better equipped with more health and assault weapons. The thieves have crossbows and silenced weapons, less health, but one major advantage; Night vision. They must navigate all the maps and turn off the lights while they steal a specific item that only they know about. The guards can find and patrol the multiple items but are not aware of which one it is, giving the less-equipped thieves a tactical advantage. Distraction is a major gameplay element here.There are also other modes to mix this up, including a Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Bomb Defusal, and more.If I had to find a criticism, well... There’s two. They both overlap slightly.The first is that the playerbase is incredibly small, usually peaking at 200 people and going down to 40-60 in off hours. While this is a fine core for the main game mode, I have found it very difficult to explore other game modes such as CTF, or that extra large map where you explore and loot (and what ever happened to Slender?!) I pretty much see 0/10 on all servers unless it’s private or just on a different gametype.Due to the small base of players, there’s no matchmaking and games don’t always autoshuffle so sometimes it can feel like a team is outclassing another. If it does shuffle, there may be a couple of particularly experienced players crushing everyone who just downloaded and are giving it a try. I'm not the worst player but I have on a few occasions found myself in an endless loop of failure because one enemy was just crushing it. I have some friends who can barely play it for more than twenty minutes at a time and it’s a shame.The flip side of this; There's no equipment or pay2win system here. If you play enough you can eventually learn the maps, figure out decent hiding patterns, and perform better yourself.(Protip: Guards can turn off their flashlights and hide in bushes themselves, which is hard to see even with night vision). That kind of thing.Regardless, It’s a great, small game with a fair amount of replayability. The matches are quick and bite-sized, and you can usually get several games in just twenty minutes or so."

The lighting is impressive with flashlight rays glinting through bushes.  Very good looking game for an early access.  It could likely be left as is in a final product without any complaint.Gameplay:  The concept is a blast and its implementation works very well.  A game is generally fast paced and discourages mission-focused individuals from camping.  Despite some lag issues on a number of servers, the game runs smoothly with people flowing in and out rooms, vents and windows.  The mouse responsiveness needs to be improved so when busting into a room as a guard, you can quickly pie slice the room with your flashlight.Sound:  Something I assume will be worked on in the future (i.e. Early Access).  There is no music and what sound effects there are tend to be minimal.Overall:  I'm having a lot of fun with this so far and I'm excited to see how it develops in the future."

The game plan is simply but great: The ""guards"" are heavily armed and have to defend one of the official or usermade maps against the ""thieves"", who are much weaker, but able to see in the dark. The graphics are not photorealistic, but wellmade with an eye for details. The community is small but friendly and new players usually find a helping hand, if they ask for one. The developers themself are very close to the community and actually consider suggestions of the community.The players can either play on one of the huge dedicated servers or host smaller servers themselves, to play with their friends. The game is free to play and the classes are available by level-up. The money from the premium accounts is only used to develop the game and to pay for the work of the developers.To sum up:If you are a friend of Indee games and if you love the idea of a stealth shooter, Of Guards and Thieves is the right game for you."

,Recommended,302590,29580797,Posted: 29 January,all,Medic Meister,"Disclaimer: Disregard the amount of hours I have in the game.  I have played this game before it was on Steam and I have yet to come around to actually buying the premium.  Thank you for reading this.Side-NoteIt isn't the developer's fault that you bought a game that is now F2P.  That is your own fault for not trying the DEMO that was available to you.  You didn't try the game before you bought it, and therefore, you paid the price.  I don't know why I see so many negative reviews of players who got ""screwed"" out of their money, but it's astonishing how unbelievably ignorant a lot of you can be that you didn't try the DEMO and you continue to complain.The ReviewThe common misconception of this game is that it is a top down, run-and-gun, type of game which is probably why they bought this game.  This game takes tactical awareness and skill to play this.  From throwing rocks to distract your enemies, to pushing in a riot shield guard to flush out rooms full of thieves.  This game is much more than just walking down hallways, rooms, vents, and gunning down masked burglars.Pros and ConsPROSPlenty of gamemodes to choose from.Still actively developed upon.The default gamemode is still rather balanced.Fun to play with friends.There aren't really any game-breaking bugs.Fun mechanics like sneaking through vents/windowsCONSPlayer-hosted servers are sometimes laggy.Admins of player-hosted servers often ban skilled players.There are no dedicated servers which leads to having to play on player-hosted servers.Small player-base.  Not many active players.Small selection of classes.  Not a large variety.Not very fun to play without friends for an extended amount of time.Some gamemodes are largely imbalanced and results to guard team usually winning.Tips and TricksPurpose of TheivesSteal Objects - It doesn't even have to be the objective.  Steal everything so that guards don't know what the thieves's objective is.Sneaking - You aren't a bullet-sponge (Not even the Juggernaut is a very good one).  You should focus on trying to get around enemies without attacking.  Utilize bushes and office plants to hide and wait for the Guards to pass.Attacking when necessary - It's best if you wait for a good time to strike.  If an enemy does not spot you, you may be able to pick him off and assist your team with pushing/opening a hole to steal the objective.Stick close - Your liable to being killed if you are next to a teammate.  Sit in one corner of a room and let a teammate sit in the other corner.  If one of you is killed, it's likely that you or your teammate will live and will be able to push further and steal the objective.Utilize grenades - I can't stress how important it is to utilizing grenades.  If you see groups of Guards bunched up, don't be afraid to lob a molotov/fragmentation grenade to disorient the group or kill them.  (This maybe harder for F2P's, but smokes do well.)Purpose of GuardsStick together - It will be often you get picked off by enemies, but if you stay in groups, you may be able to spot thieves firing at your team.  NEVER ENTER ROOMS ALONE UNLESS YOU INTEND ON GETTING YOUR BUTT SHANKED BY AN ENEMY COBRA!!!Lights - Don't forget to turn on a lightswitch.  It's a thieves worst nightmare.  Don't forget to turn your flashlight on as well.Attacking on sight - If you spot a thief, don't be afraid to gun him down.  Just. . . make sure he doesn't have a name tag above him.  That may be your teammate.Don't follow - Sometimes, it's best you don't follow a thief if you are afraid to find yourself in a situation which involves you and a lot of crossbow bolts and .45 ACP bullets being fired at you.Utilize Grenades - If you want to cut off a point of entry/exit from a thief or quickly clear out a room, a grenade is usually your best friend.  Throw a flare if you want your team to see thieves or just quickly open a door and lob a incendiary/fragmentation grenade at them and they'll go scurrying away.  Or just sit and eat it.-Medic"

It's a stealth/strategy/top-down shooter and it's loads of fun.Of Guards and Thieves basic rules:- When joining a server and when any game ends and returns to the server, immediately begin spamming ""start"" or ""go"" so the Admin knows they're permitted to begin the game. You are more important than them, after all.- Always end every game with ""gg"" regardless of how you thought the game went.- If you are a Guard, hide in bushes whenever you can, it doesn't irritate other players at all.- If you are a Thief, hide behind doors with the Cobra class whenever you can, it doesn't irritate other players at all.- Juggernaut and Guardian classes are your best friends, they aren't OP and are the most fairly balanced classes in game.PROS:- Small, mostly tight-knit community. There are multiple familiar names I see in-game that gives the game a sense of community. Always fun to play with people you enjoy playing with.- Good strategy game with a ""jump feet first into the action"" mentality, if that's your playstyle.- Can be played either casually or with intent to scar other players for life.- No huge advantage to purchasing the full game. (YES, you have more classes/gamemodes but the game is entirely playable with the demo version, and the classes (aside from Juggernaut and Medic) really don't provide much of an advantage. ~70% of players don't have the full version.- Enough variety in gamemodes to experience a wide range of fun.CONS:- Small, tight knit community. Sometimes there are barely enough players to get more than one or two good full servers running.- Some gamemodes (Zombie Rush, Demolition especially) are near impossible without some basic teamwork. Having idiots on your team can ruin a game, but each game is 5min so not for long.- Some gamemodes are kind of gimmicky and not very fun for all gamers. (Soccer/Faceless come to mind)- Early Access, I never have had the game crash but occasionally if someone joins a server as the game is starting the server can crash. Not too often does this happen though.10/10 would hide in a bush behind a door again"

Guards and Thieves, you are divided into two teams, Guards and Thieves, obviously. There are several objects of interest on a eg big office floor, the thieves know which one they can/must steal, the guards have no clue until they either hear the alarm or catch one thief red handed.Survivors vs Zombies, this reminds me of L4D and it sure as hell took a lot from it, except, it's more balanced as you can kill the survivors rather quick, if you know how. That doesn't mean the survivors are underpowered.You also have Capture the Flag, Team-Deathmatch, and Football.The map design is very detailed and offers many places eg plants, bushes, shadowy corners etc for the thieves to hide in as well as ventilation shafts, destroyable windows etc. Also very useful is the fact that anyone can use light-switches, the guards only equipped with torches, the thieves have state of the art nightvision and torches as well. You still have generic light sources though eg computer screens.Even though it appears rather simple, skill can and must be acquired in order to master the game, though it's not a ridiculous learning curve as in Chivalry, but either way, it is incredible fun.The game is Early Access and being updated constantly and there are more features than I already mentioned and tons more is planned that is already visible in the menu, just not click-able.If you want to check it out, I will post the following linkhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf0e4EzY2pA"

I had about 200 hours playing without the paid  version with all of the extra classes, and I had just about as much fun as I did with the paid as I did with the free one. Nevertheless, it was the best $9 I've ever spent, because adding more variety to the game is basically what the gold upgrade does.Now that we've gotten the ""paid vs. free"" thing out of the way, let me tell you how awesome this game is. I started playing it back in 2013 as a casual game to play with my friends together when we didn't have anything to do. We enjoyed it for hours and hours playing together, and, for a reason, this game is 100x better with friends. But thats beside the point. Me and my friends had fun for hours with the standard classes, and we also really enjoyed the teamwork aspect of this game. There's nothing better than having a cohesive team be a fortress to stop the thieves from invading; conversely, there's nothing better than having a sneaky and distracting group to help steal things. Both guard and thief sides are incredibly fun to play!The stealth mechanics are worked out really well, and the only gripe I have is that they could turn up the sounds a bit more. Besides that, the game is fantastic, and the devs actively maintain and add content.

Both sides have equal strengths and  weaknesses, the guards posess the best weaponry but need a flashlight to navigate darkened rooms whilst thieves only posses one assault heavy class but have night vision goggles allowing them unparalleled navigation across maps. Game modes are pretty basic, TDM, bomb defusal/placing, capture the flag(Or precious objects rather) and a zombie rush and soccer mode (Both of which are quite fun to play and fell less tacked on and more tasty side dish, Zombie rush is quite popular among players so be warned if tht's not your cup of tea) . The maps are well designed and make the most of the games lighting and tight controls, though the lack of music and any sense of danger reduces the atmosphere to nought, but the gameplay is very fun and competitive and the two novelty modes are fun in their own right. I can recommend this game because of the easy to learn controls and its' very interesting concept, what makes it even better is that the current already fairly meaty experience is only the tip of the iceberg so if you feel the game is not worth buying despite the many recommendations and our need for many new players just wait a few updates and then reconsider."
,Recommended,302590,12183928,"Posted: 22 September, 2014",all,Irma pls come back,"This is surprisingly good.  I'm pretty skeptical of Early Access games, and I generally don't like them because they are usually unpolished, barely playable (like DayZ) and just messy.  So, after wasting money on other early access games, I was hesitant to shell out $15 for another one.  However, I was really amazed at how well the game played.  It feels like a ""finished"" game, rather than a placeholder until they eventually make the game you bought, which you might hate in the end.The concept is good and it is executed well.  It's a 3D top-down shooter and light plays a huge part of it.  You play as one of two factions,  As a guard, you get guns, a flashlight and must fight off the sneaking thieves in a dark location; the Theives slink around turning off lights and climbing through vents and windows to reach their objective.  They are much weaker and use the dark to engage up close.  It's actually pretty scary as a guard as the lights off on the corridor you're in, meaning there's an enemy behind you.  It's actually fairly tough, but not overly unfair.There's also a zombie mode which plays basically the same, except with a zombie enemy team.  That needs the most work, I think.  There's some parts of the game that really need to be refined, like the aiming and hitbox system.  If your crosshair/character isn't at just the right spot/angle, you'll miss - which, as a thief, is very bad when you have one chance to not die.All in all, in spite of all these petty issues that need to be addressed in the future, I am very satisfied with this game.  If The company that made this skipped town with all of our money and the game never got updated beyond this, I wouldn't feel like I didn't get a full game.  If the devs stick around, there looks like a lot of promising content coming down the road.  I wait impatiently for the level editor!So, in short, yeah - it's pretty good.  It's not for everyone, but I think you'll know if you're the kind of person who would like a multiplayer stealth shooter."

The guards are tasked with keeping the thieves from stealing one of the various marked items throughout the map. Here's the catch- only the thieves know what that object is. This opens up oppportunities for strategic play, such as pretending one object is the one by continually trying (and failing) to steal it. This will bring the guard team's focus to that item, and leave the actual target less defended. As a thief you have night vision goggles, allowing you to see the guards from much farther away than they can see you. The guard team relies on flashlights and lights that can be turned on and off allowing for strategic advancement or better area control. While the thieves have less firepower than the guards one of their classes, the cobra, features a metal gear solid-esque knife pistol loadout that is a one shot kill from the knife (sacrificing range and encouraging sneakier play). Best of all, this game is free. Free? Yes, free!

The maps providedso far are unique and expansive.  There is a bit of a learning curve that can beovercome with some practice.  For me, it's all about the ability to immerse thegamer.  I enjoy the varying perspectives given by both teams.  Thieves must becunning and swift.  Guards must be systematic and precise.  When it all comestogether in the convenient form of a short-timed fast-paced game, it really ischarming.The only real complaints I have revolve around the severe lag spikes manyservers experience at random.  This may give your opponent the upperhand.I am also perplexed as to why singleplayer isn't available at this time.

76561197961697431,Recommended,302590,12384590,"Posted: 5 October, 2014",all,b2h2b,"I have mostly positive, but still mixed feelings about this game mostly because of it's Early Access status. It's not that the game is buggy or unplayable. It's the contrary, this game is fairly polished and without glaring technical issues. The problem with this game comes down to the underpopulation, which is usually a problem with multiplayer only Early Access games.OGAT is a fast paced game despite being a rather technical, strategic team game. Round timer is 5 minutes and games can be over quicker than that if the offensive team completes whatever their objective is. Each class has a set primary weapon, secondary weapon and varying numbers of equipment items. There is no way to switch out of your default class set and you have a finite amount of magazines for each of your weapons. It is important to note that I said magazines. In this game, if you reload prior to emptying your current clip, you lose all of the remaining ammo. So don't go shooting a couple of times for a kill then reload. You'll end up running out of ammo and will have to go on a literal suicide mission to get some more.The maps are asymmetrically designed to suit the strengths of each side. Maps start out lit in favor of the Guards. Lights can be switched off or on to give each side an environmental sight advantage. There are vents that can be used only by the Thieves but Guards can still shoot into them if they see a thief run into one but vice versa also applies. The other movement limitation that applies to the Guards seems silly to me. Guards cannot pass through a broken window. I would undertand if it was a size issue, but there is a Juggernaut class for the Thieves and he's larger than the majority of Guards and has more health and weaponry too. The Juggernaut should abide by the same movement restrictions that the Guards have.The balance of the classes will take some time to figure out because of the many factors involved. Each class has a different movement speed, different weapon set, different max health value. That's keeping it simple because you have to analyze each weapon's balance too. Each weapon has max damage, reload, rate of fire, ammo(capacity) and magazine count stats. I noticed, like other tactical shooters, your shots will spread to the left or right of your crosshair if you repeatedly fire a weapon for longer than 3-4 shots. I like that it's a factor in the game because despite being a top down shooter it adds to the tactical element and technique needed to successfully aim your shots. The equipment covers your usual tactical pieces of equipment: flares, grenades (frag, glue, incendiary, smoke), healing syringe, molotovs and stones. They are planning to add a few more, so don't worry about the lack of flashbangs, because they are planned for the future. The currently provided equipment does a good job of controlling space. Can't see around the corner because of darkness? Throw a flare over there and spot that sneaky thief. Guard watching the exit of the vent shaft you plan to pop out of in the light? Smoke grenade has you covered. Need to slow down that thief approaching an escape? Glue grenade will slow that thief down to a crawl.There are multiple game modes besides the eponymous Guards and Thieves mode. Soccer, Zombie Rush, Team Deathmatch, Instagib Team Deathmatch, Bomb Defusal, VIP Escort, Capture the Flag, Instagib Capture the Flag, and Mad Ball. There is work currently going on for a few additional modes as well. Hosting games is easy enough and the admin tools are fair. You can choose the combination of game mode and map that you wish to host, friendly fire (on or off), team swap, auto-balance, player kick.Now the one downside of this game is its current popularity or rather a lack of it. I haven't seen more than 150-200 global players logged into this game at once, even during primetime western hemisphere gaming hours. Even when it has reached over a 100 players, usually between 50%-66% are in game. For as easy as it is to host in this game, that is inexcusable. You'll even see host in the world chat room asking for players to join up to populate their game.Overall, I'm mostly positive on this game because of all that it has to offer. If the community grows for this game it could be a hit. Otherwise, this game is not going to last for too long without the support of a good community. I'd like to see this game do well and it would be a blast to see this game streamed among friends."

76561198072227398,Recommended,302590,13555852,"Posted: 23 December, 2014",all,Intra Cetum,"Try it before you buy it. The demo is now in the steam store, there's a standalone clienthere.My experience with Of Guards and Thieves is much greater than the hours shown on this profile: I have spent thousands of hours on the free client (and still do).Of Guards and Thieves is a top-down third-person shooter that focuses on a balance mechanic of one team having higher firepower but limited vision in the dark(Guards), and another team having lesser firepower but night vision goggles(Thieves).The primary game mode the game's name is based off of, ""Guards and Thieves"", is a mode where guards must protect one of six objects by preventing thieves from stealing said object reaching an ""exit point"" with the object in hand. The game type, while fun, does lack fundamental levels of balance, as every larger map increases the difficulty for Guards to successfully defend, with certain object positions completely indefensible. The primary issue with this game mode is that due to the guards not knowing which item the thieves want to steal, they have to spread their forces thin to protect the map, which thieves then exploit, swiftly leading to a win. If the thieves want to secure their win even more, they can confuse the guards by pretending to target a different item and conditioning them to focus defenses in an area opposite the real target, to add insult to injury.The second most popular mode, Zombie Rush, is a quasi-Left 4 Dead clone, with spitting zombies, bulky zombies that throw rocks, and fast zombies that kill quickly but also die quickly. This mode is also very fun, but probably the most imbalanced mode in the game. The inherent flaw with Zombie Rush is not just the brain locations varying in difficulty to attack (wide bottlenecks with large spotlights and you can shoot the people attacking the brain from spawn, for example), but the inherent design of zombie's lack of range or speed combined with a horrendous hit detection mechanic making melee-based zombies highly dependent on your target not having above 100 ping. Even then, slight delays while attacking this mode's arguably strongest defender class, the Scout, can cause the game to audibly make the sound of the zombie striking the player multiple times and not lead to even damaging that player. This leads to a full game of zombie pros mowing down the zombie-side players with Scouts, rarely suffering any casualty that wasn't due to user AND team failure.Of Guards and Thieves' game offerings lack balance in almost every game type they offer. The only game type with a semblance of balance, Soccer, is a gimmicky game mode which shows off the extremely strange object physics of the game when lag is involved, and seems exactly like you'd expect Soccer to be in such a game. Except, the players have knives..? And the knives are your ability to kick the ball..? And the server settings can be turned on so you can kill each other with said knives.It's a weird game, and it has a lot of issues (like the cringey seasonal decorations which make the maps worse for certain sides), but if you can get past the horrible community, strange business design, nearly dead forums, and horribly balanced gametypes, you can enjoy it for what it is: a shooting game that's really weird."

Think Gmod Prophunt only the props are other guys and playing as a Hunter is actually fun. The guards are at an advantage weaponry-wise so the thieves must make use of light and sneaky confusion tactics. The only bad thing about this game is that not enough people play it to make a good online session with lots of people occur often. BUY IT PEOPLE, IT'S REALLY FUN!! There's also a ♥♥♥♥load of gamemodes, but I'd say that the simple default one is the best.My advice is to put on some tense music to improve the atmosphere, which is only accentuated by the brilliant lighting and how both sides have to use it to their advantage."

,Recommended,302590,11598678,"Posted: 8 August, 2014",all,MrNobodyX3,"I come from the area of stealth lovers. As a stealth lover I often play games like Metal Gear and Splinter Cell. So it is no surprise that I have found this game! I have a need a need… to be unheard and unseen, like a phantom in the night.This game reminds me of the multiplayer on the Splinter Cell series. Spies versus Merks is a game where one team with heavy weaponry and little vision. With only their flashlights for site in the dark. The other team the ability to see in the dark and escape in shadow.Of Guards and Thieves filled the whole Ubisoft left when they took my beloved Spies versus Merks out into the backyard and beat it over the head with sticks and stupidity. After that incident I couldn't find the game that was as good as what Spies versus Merks was. And this is it, Of Guards and Thieves has given me what I've been looking for.Not only that but there are other game modes besides the asymmetric game mode of stealth action. A variety of games and more to come. Such as Zombie Rush, Mad Ball, Soccer (Football), and Instagib (A game type taken from the classic game Quake). Even a level editor currently not released but will be. Soon I hope!PROS:An easy game to learn and play. There are not many game breaking glitches and the ones that are there are not easy to come by. Like I stated above it filled my need for stealth. You can lose yourself for hours in this game. The art style is perfect!CONS:Players on the game are rare to find when it comes to someone that knows what they're doing. Some classes on the thief side are unbalanced such as the medic, more of a personal opinion but I feel the medic on the thief side is pointless. As well as the juggernaut, a heavy weaponry class given to the thieves that is pretty powerful. I have given a suggestion to the developers in terms of balance in this class. However no response has been given. On that topic the developers are not clear whether or not your opinion and suggestions are noted. The developers haven't given a clear direction for this game. Whether or not it's going to be Free to Pay or one time pay model. As some conversations with the developers suggest they will have ULC (unlockable content, content that is built into the game and set to unlock once payment is initiated).The direction of the final game is unclear. As said they suggest they will have ULC. If done for just skins, costumes, or other customizables. It would be a real shame to see this game go down because of stupidity in locking away game modes. From the sounds of it this will be a one time payment and you will have the game. Whether or not it will be the full game is up to the developers.Despite this I do suggest this game as it is fun to play and it is often overlooked and underrated. The gameplay primarily reminds me of Spies versus Merks but at the same time becomes its own game. For this I have hope in this indie title, hope that the developers don't do anything stupid, hope more players find this game, and hope for a new breed of stealth lovers."

I didnt regret it, either. The problem is the community. It's tiny. Not only that, but the people arnt as friendly as they used to be. Further more, the real only reason to buy this is if you plan on running servers. The extra classes don't offer too much and you can play premium maps as long as someone with premium is hosting.

Also, development is painfully slow and most of the side modes are too unneeded. Like, who even wanted a sbtdm mode? Car racing is even dumber. I know these modes are actually just tests for the bigger mode, survival, but even then, who wanted that mode? Who bought OGAT and expected/wanted to have a huge open world survival game? It's like buying CS:GO and expecting it to have a car racing mode. It just doesn't make any sense. Literally stopping developing the main mode and focusing on these modes for months doesn't make an awful lot of sense either, at least to me. It still has the same problems it had 2 years ago. Netcode is still awful. Classes are still a bit unbalanced. Dedicated servers are still glitchy as hell, but instead of fixing this stuff, they're releasing new car models. Umm, yay?I used to love OGAT, but i honestly can't recommend this game to anyone right now.  I'd really want to, but i just can't.

,Not Recommended,302590,12184108,"Posted: 22 September, 2014",all,Deadjack,"[Updated the 10/13/2014]I love this game.The concept is great: heavy armed guards are protecting some items from stealthy thieves. You have few cool classes:Guards= the scout (run fast and throws flares and glue grenades to slow thieves), assault (the guys with a the best rifle, throws frag grenades), riot (the though dude with a riot shield, a gun and throws smoke grenades), carrier (the versatile one who throws incendiary grenades to defend), medic (he heals from distance with a TF2 seringe gun, attack with a pistol and his melee weapon heals too).Thieves= the shadow (uses a crossbow to take down guards from afar, throws smoke grenades to lure), the cobra (like solid snake, he uses a knife, a pistol and throws rocks to make noise), saboteur (same as the guards carrier but weaker), medic (same as the guards but....), juggernaut (the thought guy with a rifle, a gun and frag grenades).You see the game from above so you can anticipate enemy's movements and set strategies. Plus you can see nice lighting effects.Many guys are ranting because they want first person view...But it's out of the subject of the game.Maps are nice but some are difficults to master, like the cemetery or the millitary camp.Usually you will play on the offices or the mansion...Some modes to play (you got some others but there is a full list on the wiki):The Guards and Thieves or Gat (thieves must steal a specific item and reach the exit, there are some other items so they can lure the guards...)Zombie rush (zombies must eat a brain the guards are protecting. Zombies are weak but fast and deadly in close combat. They have 5 classes, from the zombie runner to the bloiter, everything you saw on other zombie games is here except the one with a retractable tongue).Vip (a player is the target of the thieves/assassins, and must reach the exit without dying)Bomb defusal (few locations are marked and the thieves must plant a bomb and let it explode, guards must stop them)Capture the flag (everything as been said).Team deathmatch (same !)Soccer (well the most annoying one, you hit the ball to throw it... in the goal).But again the problem is, like a guy said on an other game, balance.This game is too much unbalanced. Some games modes are incredibly unfair, like zombie rush.So you will see all the time players taking the same classes and will rush mindlessly.Very few of them are working together. Only thieves are forced to work as a team because they are very weak.Actualy teams are composed of the assault class vs cobras.And like other indie multiplayer games, the community is sometimes bad.Players are not the only problem. In fact it's servers admins.Games are hosted by players. So quite oftent you have conection problems. But this is not the most enerving...Admins are often completely not responsible.They can do what they want and it's usually for the worst.Many players thinks the game is unbalanced so they punish if someone take a specific class.And the most annoying, they do not ""clean"" their hosting.Few times i was insulted by players and the admin just do nothing about that.So i don't recommand this game until they bring dedicated servers and do more stable hosting because actually you lag and are often disconected.If you buy this game, please..Be fair play !"

Everything I paid for is now available to everyone for free.  Paid users are now left completely ripped off, and what do we get?  A 25% exp boost to EVERYONE in the server.

For starters, when the game started on Game Jolt, all the servers were US.  Now that it is on Steam, you are lucky to find one US server at any time of the day.  There is no US dedicated server and if there is it is either always full or under maintenance or something cause I never see it anywhere.  The cool Sandbox mode they added is only available on a DU Dedicated Server.  Can we please run our own servers and also have Sandbox Mode?  That is the reason for the lag in Sandbox, it is not localized for everyone.  It's like the Dutch and Russian servers get to beta test all these awesome features and we are left with nothing for months.  Also, the amount of game modes are large, but they are for the most part the same thing.  the death matches for one are far too balanced in favor of the Thieves because of night vision.  Something that would be cool is a First Person mode.  It would certainly let people have an interesting experience, a first person multiplayer stealth game that doesn't have Tom Clancy before the title.  There could also be a mode where the thieves have no weapons to fight back so they have to rely on stealth, because honestly, bringing in AK's and sub machine guns isn't exactly thief behavior.  That's more mercenary or terrorist behavior, which would fit since one of the modes is ripped directly from Counter Strike.  I can't complain since it loves to have fun with pop culture like stealing the Half Life 3 Source Code or the Super Meatboy Poster.  There is also Faceless which doesn't take much imagination to realize it is Slender in top down, but that game mode isn't really functional since no one can find any of the pages, and even if they can they can only find one out of 8, allowing Faceless to kill the survivors hundreds of times over before that.  All in all, give it a try.  But Subvert, could we possibly see a couple new and unique game modes?  I have a couple which could be rather interesting and from the people I have tested it on that would cooperate, it proved rather fun for them as well.  If you do read this, hit me up and I can let you know what I have planned.  And if not, I'll just stick to running it privately on my own server."

I ♥♥♥♥ing love it, when I get to play it.Which is my primary gripe, there aren't enough people who play this. Plenty to keep around 3 servers up and running, but there's so much veriety in the game that it needs way more players and servers to allow people to explore it fully.Aside from that there's some latency issues with bad player run servers, but that's minor, and to be expected with player run servers."

Bear in mind this is still Early Access!PROS:1) Incredibly addictive if you like this type of game.2) Quite relaxing to play (oddly enough)3) Simple to play - You're either a guard or thief. Guards defend items, thieves steal them and return to the exit point.4) Great multiplayer, and more features are going to be added later, like single player etcCONS:1) No option for voice comms/mics, although there is a TS server.2) The highest screen resolution you can get is 1280 x 960 (so far)3) Still a bit buggy. For example, after a recent update, the controls reset themselves to different bindings. Easy to fix though.4) As it stands, it's still a tad rough round the edges.All in all, it's worth a look. But I'm sure it'll get better as it gets further and further into development.6/10"

The main mode ""Guards and Thieves"" is well polished experience, where thieves try to sneak up on their goal objective and escape with it (guards are told several objects, but they don't know which one is the right target).Both sides have 4 classes, which all workout pretty well, I don't find any of them overpowered or something.The game is really enjoyable as it is and has promising chances to become pretty competetive.For now, I haven't found single bug or glitch in this game.
