You cannot move more than 1 tile to the sideways without landing first though.The goal is to get as much energy as possible by running on the blue tiles while avoiding any collisions or bottomless pits. Once you reach 100% of energy you're free to collide against something or fall to end a stage, otherwise you can keep going and try to reach a higher score.* Simple graphics, which means it can run on any toaster and wont bother you while going at full speed.* Good soundtrack! It's kinda electronic-something, I don't know, it sounds good enough in game and it changes dynamically (The more upbeat version plays when you reach over 100% of energy).* Controls are quite comfortable. You can just plug in your Xbox 360 controller and be ready to play. You can move with the triggers, the shoulder buttons, the directional pad and the analog, they're all supported at the same time.* Excellent port of what I suppose is an iOS game. No flaws in framerate nor stuttering or anything.* Achievements aren't something so special here, they're all about you beating a stage. Latter stages are quite hard though! Still, it would've been cool to have some weird achievements or even some score attack ones to push you to try harder.* Good replayability if you care about score attack and leaderboards.I'm sure the graphics are WAY too simple for a lot of people but the game is just 3 dollars full price. I don't really mind that. I had lots of fun so far and I expect to 100% the game in a few days."

,Recommended,302610,18104456,"Posted: 19 September, 2015",all,Jadarma,"OverviewBoson Xis a rotational infinite runner with a nice premise, addictive gameplay and challenging difficulty. You play as one of three characters of your choosing and run along platforms inside a particle accelerator, in the hopes of discovering a new one! This is one of those games that is simple to grasp, but hard to play! If you thoughtSuper Hexagonwas fun and difficult, well, now you have this Decagon to try and master!The Pros:Fitting Visuals- The game's focus on fast moving objects and rapid player movements make choosing this minimalist art style very fitting. There are no textures, just solid colors, and it just works! You won't get distracted by textures, instead all your attention is to be averted to your movements. Also, it kind of makes sense, as you are travelling between particles. Things to small to have textures (or geometrical shapes, for that matter, but we'll let this one slide).Level Generation- The levels are put together using procedural generation, but not by randomness, There are modules put together in a random order. So, once you'll play enough of a level, you will start to get used to the more difficult steps. This is great, because you can learn without having to go through the same level over and over if you fail.What's more, each level has it's own theme - different modules, different speeds, different color schemes and even unique pieces!Addictive in Nature- Even though later levels will make you want to scream because of how hard they are, dying is sometimes enjoyable, and just makes you want to play again, because you are confident you can pull it off! Also, a great game to play when bored.Scoring and Leaderboards- Instead of scoring you on how long you stay alive, or how far you've gone, the game scores you in percentages, and that increases each time you run on blue platforms. Once you reach 100%, you pass the level, and go into a sort ofhyperdrivewith increased speed, a change of color scheme and significantly increased difficulty. Leaderboards are also wonderfully done, with scores broke down by level, in total, and friend comparison.Reasonable Achievements- The achievements are all based on finishing the levels. There are 18 in total, but don't think this will be an easy feat. You may be surprised how challenging this game can get.Cons:Surprisingly.. None- It's rare I never find a con in a game. This one is the exception that enforces the rule. The game does what it sets to: Gives an addictive, infinite runner game, with no garbage on the side - just plain, good, challenging fun. For people that would consider the difficulty a con, you are missing the point. For this genre, a more merciful experience will do nothing but dampening the fun.Conclusion:If you like infinite runners, are up for a challenge and you want a great game for cheap (also featured on sales for next to nothing), this is an easy purchase. Buy with confidence.If you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work,consider joining my groupandfollow my curatorpage! Link to the right!Jad's List - Curator Group"

,Recommended,302610,19247252,"Posted: 24 November, 2015",all,vaylren,"I recommend playing this game to some extent. The first 2 sets of levels (possibly the top 3 on the last set) are difficult enough to be rewarding, provide a good skill curve, and are very interesting both visually and conceptually. However, the rng elements of the game become increasingly infuriating in the last couple of levels, outweighing the reward of improving and passing each pattern section of the levels.Some of the level design is questionable, for example on the anti Y boson level, the platforms in one pattern section are actually hidden and completely non visible until it is too late to react. On other levels, the visuals, though overall excellent, can cause issues with vision on where to go next.I definitely don't regret buying this, but I wouldn't recommend this for everyone, especially for people like me who don't play games like this very frequently."

By running on glowing blue platforms, your score (and speed) will increase; victory is achieved by scoring 100%. As mentioned above, while the premise is very simple, each level is distinctly different from one another and some even include special hazards.$3 gives you 18 levels with huge replay value.

An fast-paced indie platformer that requires a lot of memorization of patterns to get you through.It seems that the objective is to help two (or three if you consider a robot one) scientists discover three particles by traveling through some visual starfield. The goal is to run along blue platforms that emerge from the endless void around you, building up enough energy to spark a particle. This task, as you progress, isn't as easy as it seems as newer stages bring forth new obstacles, may it be moving white flats, fragile red flats, thick walls, and even rings that emit electric currents. All this game really needs is mind power and complete concentration.ReviewThe GoodBoson X has proven its to be a worthy challenge, taking nearly months to actually beat all levels (for me anyways). At first glance, I truly thought I had what it took to beat it, to little avail. Up until you reach a certain point, the game provides a nice, minimalistic and basic gameplay that can be enjoyed... if you're into games like this one, of course. The music that plays in the six stages is also pretty fine as well.The BadWhile this game doesn't a lot, I can't seem to find a lot of bad things to say about it aside from no real replay material implemented into it. That's... about all I can point out atm.Concluding CommentsIt's a pretty intense but exciting little game that I somewhat find kinda funny too if you manage to envelop yourself deep into the game, not pressing to strive straight for instant wins or even trying to beat the game. And if you're one to shoot for those top ranks on the leaderboards, I wish you greatest luck for you. I'm sure there are very many already high up, but who's to say you can't get up there?--Hermix."

The aim of the game is to run and jump left and right along a brightly coloured and long hexagonal tube, while trying to run along blue flashing tiles until your velocity (or whatever it's called) reaches 100%. After reaching 100% you keep running until you die and then unlock the next level.That is basically how the whole game plays out. My description may sound underwhelming, but honestly it is a great game. I paid 19p for it on sale (about 29 cents/0.29 usd) and I honestly would pay the full amount of £2 (3.05 usd) because it honestly worth it.Do yourself a favour and bless your game library with this endless-running gem.Final score: 7~8/10"
,Recommended,302610,34237432,Posted: 14 August,all,Holysword,"Did you ever dream of becoming a researcher, helping mankind to unveil the mysteries of the universe? Yes? Then close Steam and go study.Otherwise you might want to play some games, such as Boson X. Whereas the premise about the particle accelerator itself is merely illustrative, the game itself is fun.The mechanics are pretty simple: constantly run, jump straight or jump+rotate right/left.  To complete a scenario you must stand on blue platforms which grant you ""research points"". Nearing 100% research points for one stage will increase the running speed of your Researcher (and thus the difficulty) and reaching 100% research points completes the stage and unlocks further stages. Otherwise, red platforms collapse once you step on them, and blinking platforms are actually moving. Stages are randomly generated, but you can clearly notice the ""building blocks"" for the randomization.That's it about the mechanics. It doesn't change much during the game. The increasing difficulty comes from the initial speed of later stages, more complex platform structures, lack of shadows that will twist your depth perception and psychedelic textures that will confuse your naive brain. I didn't find it obscenely difficult, however.Boson X is pretty inexpensive, has cards and the achievements are natural. The last achievement having 8% completion rate honestly surprised me. It felt more like a 2% achievement. I think I'd add the ""casual"" tag to this game."
,Recommended,302610,12136833,"Posted: 18 September, 2014",all,EQB Panoroma,"Since times before the personal computer, arcade and arcade-like games have been liked and played by a majority of gamers, even in the futuristic year of 2014. And among these types of games, there are the runners, the one where you have to ""simply"" dodge and jump on and over hazards and other objects. However, Boson X takes that principle to an entirely different level.The goal of Boson X is to run and jump from platform to platform on a 3D field, and filling up your meter by running on the (glowing) blue platforms. When this meter reaches 100%, you'll ""discover a new element"" and finish the level, but you can keep going to increase this meter even more at a higher speed, which will make you look better on the online score boards.Your character can jump forward, or jump to either the left path next to them, or the right. You cannot change your path mid-jump, and you can hold down the key to increase your jump height. The controls might sound simple, and they are in theory, but you'll have to use these three commands to their fullest potential if you want a chance at beating all 18 levels.Boson X is what people may call a ""Super Hexagon on foot"", most likely because the game has a hexagon field, and you have to dodge empty spaces and walls. Though not exactly true, they both share a similarity: They're both incredibly difficult. Boson X will test your reaction time to new lengths as you progress through the game, adding in different types of platforms, appearing in different ways and speeds. Though each level has a certain pattern, the way these patterns emerge are in parts and randomized, so memorizing them won't do you much good if you don't have the reaction speed to match it.For 3$/3€, Boson X is well worth your money, with levels that will make you want to pull your hair out, incredibly smooth gameplay, and if you're dedicated enough, you'll put plenty of hours into it. Just make sure you've got the patience for it, otherwise your monitor will be on the other side of your room by the time you've failed the same level a hundred times.And trust me, you will."

The shape-shifting platforms, progress updates, and scientifically enhanced optical illusions are what set this apart to many other rage games.You're placed in this massive particle accelerator, which could arguably be the Large Hadron Collider, where you must land on cyan colored platforms to raise the peak energy of the particle you're attempting to unearth. Reaching 100% energy results in successfully discovering a new particle, and each particle (level) presents you with new gauntlets of varying speeds and obstacles. The gameplay is a tiny bit similar to Super Hexagon, where you must traverse a shapeshifting polygon to progress towards level completion.The game's base price should suit the amount of time you'll get out of it.

There are situations that may seem impossible to get through but after  thinking for a second you will realize it was just a visual trick to make it look harder than it is. The main problem is that you have less than a second to react. Boson X's gameplay is really interesting since you have to memorize different parts of the levels which, for some poeple, may be the main reason not to buy the game. If you enjoy trial and error type of games this game is just right for you. The levels are short but they require quite some time to memorize each part of the level.Other than the gameplay, Boson X doesn't have much going.

Sadly the game suffers from poor pacing, a painfully gaudy color palette , a very steep difficulty curve and somewhat badly designed levels that will frustrate Boson X players more than challenge them. While the game states that you need quick reflexes to succeed, you will find yourself relying blind luck (and a fair bit of patience) to hit that '100% discovered' meter. The only real reason I am positively recommending this game is that it does offer a fair amount of value (in terms of gameplay) for what it costs to buy. Also, there is no 'Average' rating.P.S.

Finally.If you have played Super Hexagon or other related games, then you will notice that this game is actually quite similar: Both as hard as ♥♥♥♥.Boson X is a fast-paced action game where you are either a male/female physicist, or a lab robot. Your mission is to fill a certain meter (that which goes up to 100%) to pass that level, and an optional task to make it even higher.Kudos to the company that made and published this game into Steam! I wasn't able to play this on mobile since I found this one on Steam first, but all-in-all it's good!Pros:- Very fluid gameplay- Good BGM brings energy and tension while you play. The techno music fits very well- Over 18 levels to complete and master- Simple controls. It takes less time for you to master them- Simple graphics yet the background colors makes it engaging and immerseful- LEADERBOARDS! Perfect forBragging RightsCons:- Inrareoccurances, some key inputs do not work, leading you to fail or misstep. It may be due to over-pressing the same key, or just a bug. Either way, if you chance to experience this, it is very frustrating- When you get deeper into the levels of the game, the BGM tends to be repetitive and boring. Also the BGMs are only few.- Aside from the 18 levels, there are nothing more to do, probably to aim high into the Leaderboards- Some levels have very bright colors, to very dark and confusing color blocks. Makes it hard to time when you will land and/or aim for a higher score when you finish the level. Of course, practice is key- Leaderboards are so full of cheaters. If I were you, I'd steer clear of it. There are some who have 5000% scores on most levels. Insane right? It's a shame because it ruins the endgame achievement.Overall, this game is great. If you are not fond of Leaderboards, then you will finish this in 7-10 hours or so.This game requires a lot of focus and patience. Not doing so will make you rage every time you fail. If you are that type of person, I'd best stay away from this game.But, should you want to try this, get ready to immerse in a game full of jumping, side-stepping, LSD environment, MLG moments, multiple retries, and failure-induced raging."

,Recommended,302610,12756204,"Posted: 2 November, 2014",all,Kraeyq,"Boson X provides a simple and clean endless runner experience with a mixture of randomization. While the characters that you chose only make a difference visually, the game attempts and succeeds in providing a unique set of levels that you will definitely find challenging without some practice. The controls are simple yet may feel difficult if you try to jump like a traditional platformer would.The only reason I picked up Boson X was to complete the achievements and try out something that I usually do not play. I'm one of those observers that looks at the running genre and wants to run with it but ends up saying no because of price, mechanics, or fear that the product will fall short of my expectations. Boson X  not only met my expectations but blew my mind with some of the crazy levels that were thrown at me.The objective of the game is very simple: keep on the platforms and try to run on the blue ones. While there are several hazards to look out for, that is the essence of the game. Running on blue platforms will get you closer to completing the level and make you run faster and faster building up tension and excitement when your beat your highscore. Leaderboards are offered and can be fun to push yourself further up the leaderboards after you have completed a level.The level variety and difficulty is reasonable and able to be mastered to a certain extent. Randomization helps break up monotony and adds to the mystery of what your going to run through next. Levels that I thought were impossible were beatable in a few days of learning the level (and a lot of failing).During my time of playing Boson X, I have not found any game breaking bugs... or actually any bugs at all.  I can confirm that it works on the Xbox 360 controller as advertised. The game performed exceptionally well and had options to play in window and fullscreen modes. This was especially useful as I was able to practice and play Boson X while watching Youtube or Twitch.I highly recommend this for anyone who think they might be into runners."

While there are definitely still annoyances which sometimes screws up your game (like getting to 98% on a really hard level only to have the game screw you over by giving you not possible place to land *shakes fist*) it is still really fun, and aren't games supposed to be fun? Plus I believe it has taught me anger management skills. You can't play a frustratingly difficult game if you've put your foot through your monitor.*This review is not negative by any means, it's more neutral than anything. Why? It's a good game with fun concepts, and while it's supposed to be difficult, the way in which they implemented this difficulty was pretty poor.You need to make decisions, often at the last minute as the track is being built right before your eyes. This can be tedious because, well, most people don't have the ability to see into the future?...The point of each level is to go faster, which means landing on the bright blue track pieces. This would be fine if it weren't for the fact you are often punished for going too fast: You land on a blue track, go fast, try and jump onto the next bit and find you went too fast and just jumped into the abyss.The track building is generally REALLY slow if you're going fast.

It isn't bad really, but there was one level where the screen was blank at times except for a bunch of blinking paths.

It is a nice touch that they added the ability to pick your gender, but it doesn't really affect the gameplay beyond the footstep sound.The game is what you could call 3D, however the main running is along the x axis, you jump on the y and instead of moving left/right to avoid obstacles or jump gaps, you 'rotate' around a predefined polygon. This was an interesting game mechanic, and I felt the game executed it very well.The different levels generate randomly but each one has its own signature features, from platforms that move or drop out beneath you to the various structures that they make up. This is good, because it prevents you from just learning the tricks to the first level and burning right through the others.The style is very minimalistic, and it manages to pull it off well. With the exception of one level and its 'wireframe' look [which is completely impossible to play, as far as i'm concerned], the various styles to levels work nicely. Some of the music is good, but overall it was OK. The world you run through doesn't require the music [i.e. it isn't generated according to the music], although it would be a nice addition if they made that so.It can be played with either the keyboard or controller, and both work equally well for this game.

It's still there, so you can try it out if you want.The steam version has two new characters, 12 new levels, achievements and cards.It has good music, is pretty addictive and the levels offer a lot of variety.The graphics are very simple, but I like them.The only thing that might be negative for some people is that in order to complete a level,you definitely need to memorize its pattern. This can be a bit frustratingbecause you can't always see what's ahead of you and plan your next step.In my opinion it's still worth buying it (just bought in a sale for 0,74€).It's fun and I enjoy it very much."

I actually forgot about it but remember it being pretty enjoyable so decided to give it a shot when I saw it on sale here.Boson X is really fun and addictive running game. It's got some great twists on the usual conventions. The way in which you jump from each platform took some time to adapt to and was quite frustrating at first. Once you push a certain direction, you've committed to that direction, until you land again. Holding the direction makes you jump longer gaps. Once you get the technique down, it's incredibly satisfying.The visuals and music are both appealing. The feel of the game is great and it all comes together well. Despite retrying levels endlessly, the music still works and adds to the experience without becoming annoying which is always a possibility in games like this.One thing that is slightly annoying is that the levels are in sections which seem to randomly shuffle each time. And the way to complete the level is to run across enough blue tiles. Therefore sometimes you can be running for longer than your previous attempts but have alesspercentage of completion than those attempts. Didn't stop me from retrying the level though..."

,Recommended,302610,13460627,"Posted: 19 December, 2014",all,Snort Cannon,Boson X is one of those incredibly difficult games like Super Meat Boy or Super hexagon but this time its an endless runner. But will you want to buy this game ? Boson X doesnt really have a story. You can pick a charecter you want to play as and the goal is to run on particle tiles to power up a particale exelarator. So how is this game ? Boson X is a really fun game and i highly suggest you check it out. Boson X plays a little diffrently than youre regular endless runner. You have to twist the world arround you to get to youre goal. The game gets harder as you go on but it never becomes too dificult that you want to quit the game and stop playing it. The game has a few bugs like falling through the tiles happend twice to me. But that was about it. The game has a bit tricky controls and it takes a while to get used to but once you do its all smooth sailing from there. Overall Boson X is a really fun Endless runner that is cheap and fun. Pros: 18 levels. Fun premise. Replay Value.Cons: A few minor bugs. Tricky controls. Overall you need to pick up Boson X. For the price its a steal. The game is fun and its one of the more fun difficult games i played in a while. I give Boson X a 8/10

There is no reason that I should not enjoy the Olympics. It combines sport, something I take mild interest in, and competition betwixt nations, which infatuated me inexplicably when I was younger. But the reason I dislike the Olympics is what you're seeing on the screen right now, or rather the fact that no-one actually cares about what you're seeing on screen right now. You're probably thinking to yourself, ""what are you talking about? Of course people care about the results of the Olympics Thomas."" But the truth of the matter is what people really care about is the results of the individual events. I guess that's fin if you're a big sports fan, or if you're related to one of the athletes, but the fact that these results don't culminate into something, and that there's no overall winner of the Olympics drives me up the wall. Allow me to explain. Of course the Olympics does have a winner, the person who wins the most medals. But who on earth cares in the end? The winning country doesn't get some special award in the closing ceremony. People don't talk about them in social events. Not to mention, countries with higher populations have an insane advantage. As a result, the Olympics is only a competition between athletes, and not countries. And that's where the olympics loses me. I don't wanna watch Sanne Verhagen vs Hortance Diedhiou, I wanna watch the Netherlands vs Senegal. I don't wanna watch Morad Zemouri vs Dirk Van Tichelt, I wanna watch Qatar vs Belgium. I don't wanna watch Victor Scvortov vs Zeyad Mater, I wanna watch the United Arab Emirates vs Yemen. You get the idea. With sporting events like the world cup where it's one sport, keeping up with the athletes is easy enough. I overhear people discussing the performance of certain players all the time. But come Olympic time, nobody I listen to is raving about the performances of a certain athlete. Ask anyone who won a certain event, they aren't gonna say Frank Stevens, or Jeff Smith. Or however you pronounce this. They're gonna say countries like USA, or China, or UK, or Central African Republic, I.E. The thing the Olympics wants you to think is less important than the athletes.So if I'm just following individual athletes, and not how a certain country or countries are doing, then I don not care. Am I supposed to just pick a favourite? I was watching women's gymnastics the other day for... reasons... and I guess I'm supporting Switzerland. Not because I have Swiss blood or Swiss pride  or I feel that they are gonna necessarily win. Instead because Giulia Steingruber is attractive. Ok, I don't hate the Olympics. Most of the time sports are boring to watch (Excluding the aforementioned), and I guess if you're really patriotic, you'll watch events to support your country, and see the successes of your fellow man. But I'm not a patriotic person. And when choosing who to support comes down to drawing a random card from the pile, it's no longer a game of earning supporters. It's a game of Mario Party."

Plus the platforms are created randomly only a few second in front of you, and worse, you can't move when you are mid-air. So, basically you just do a gamble jump and hope you won't fall or hit a wall. Die. retry. die again. hundreds of times. repeat. still die again. alot. rage.Is that sounds fun to you? and you pay for it.for me, a game is supposed to be entertaining. rather than frustating. If I want to get stress, I'd better go to work instead.I think the game would be more enjoyable, if there are check points, or you can move mid-air, or at least there are warnings what's in front of you, like 'no platform', 'dead end', 'high wall', 'hole', or fix the color to make the platforms more visible. And to compensate the nerf, just make the route longer."

I'm an avid gamer and I like difficult games, and indie games, and this type of design.  But this game is atrocious.  I can't be the only one who thinks so?This game is a hipster-hype nightmare.  The gameplay the boring ""test your reaction time"" type, OK, fine.  I'm already not that enticed but whatever.  I gave it a good few plays, on multiple occasions, and I wanted to love it.  Then I just wanted to LIKE it.  But it's one of those games that has some tricky mechanic which seems unfair - in Boson X's case, you jump platforms - but the thing is, after a level or two platforms start randomly dropping off.  But there isn't any indication of when this happens, at least that I could tell, and it is just too hard to determine your vertical position - there isn't any ground or reference area to be able to tell if the platform is dropping - it starts to drop, you jump, but you're too low to make the next platform, and the game says Ooopsoe!  Try again!  But.... it doesn't feel like my fault, like I could even do anything about those deaths.So the end effect is that I start the game, play an easy level, think ""ooo, I may like this"". Next level, I'll jump to a platform and be too low to land it.... but.... what?  I didn't even know I was dropping.  So I try the tutorial, which is of the modern, very hipster, minimalist school of tutorials where it has to be self-righteous about its hyper simple core gameplay, emphasising how ""clean"" and ""simple"" the gameplay is.  But it doesn't even mention these dropping platforms!  How do I deal with them?  They seem unpredictable and random, and every time you die from being too low it seems really cheap to me.I search online, and of course, you just hear people bragging about how amazing they are and how easy the game is etc..... I dunno.  For my money (and I did pay money for this game!), it's an overhyped game which treats its players with disrespect.  I love a game which punishes - but it has to feel fair.  This game feels like it throws me under a bus, and I didn't even know the bus was coming, and I didn't even see the bus until my face was plated firmly in the bumper.  I wish I could at least find info on how those falling platforms work, but all you can find is over-hype and people bragging about how awesome they are, or how amazing the game is, etc.  Honestly - overhyped, boring gameplay, and the design is too noisy and trendy/indie/bleh.  And this is coming from an indie games NERD."

Or if you just want some of the most tense gameplay you'll ever experience, then this will also be for you.  As someone who normally doesn't like fast-paced games like these, I was surprised by how much I enjoy Boson X.  It has a very unique concept (though prone to comparisons with Super Hexagon, which came out around the same time) and it continually gets interesting in new ways.It only has 18 levels, six of which I had already played in the alpha version before release, but the game does not get stale at any point.  Every level does something unique and forces the player to get used to a new challenge before continuing to the next one.  The pace of the game forces players to think quickly before making a decision, usually ending in instant death, but steady progress makes the deaths feel rewarding regardless of how difficult the levels are.Like many other hardcore games, the feeling of completing a level is very satisfying, but due to the simplicity of the game's mechanics and the innovation that is done with the game's simplicity, the frustration that usually accompanies that feeling is present to a far smaller degree than usual.  The different aesthetics of each level are an integral factor to the level's challenge, but they also look absolutely beautiful at times and give each stage its own identity. The Dark X Boson level in particular has a creative design that both looks incredible and takes a very long time to get used to.There is only one negative aspect I've found with the game, and that is the soundtrack.  The music is repetitive and gets annoying very quickly as a level is attempted many times.  Fortunately, the game gives the option to mute the music so that players can choose their own soundtrack.  It's sometimes easier to simply play in silece as it allows for uninterrupted focus on the game.This game is definitely worth the $3 for several hours of exciting gameplay and very well designed levels.  I cannot recommend Boson X enough."

I keep coming back to this one, its a timeless classic to me.You run around a level varying from mostly hexagonal (and once pentagonal and once dual) levels jumping to and running on platforms. Energy platforms increase your energy which you need to get to 100% to advance to the next level. The higher your energy %, the faster you move forward so the harder it gets.I used to play the free version until I discovered there was a paid one with extra levels. I just like the whole concept of easy-to-learn, hard-to-master with progressive difficulty (and levels are dynamic, sections are randomly placed together so no run will ever be the exactly same, but they are similar enough to learn the patterns). Not to mention I personally like the art style.It reminds me of Zone mode from Wipeout HD.Definitely worth the money from my perspective.

,Recommended,302610,16145361,"Posted: 2 June, 2015",all,Ipquarx,"This is a very well-made endless-runner game by a couple of indie developers.The basic idea is that your character represents a particle in a series of 3 particle accellerators, and you need to get your particle up to a certain energy level by standing on the blue platorms. If you hit anything head-on or fall down you have to start over again. As you get more and more power you start to move faster and faster. Once you get to 100% you can either collide with something to discover a new particle or you can continue on to get a high score for your power level.That said, the game technically does have an official endpoint. The game is named ""Boson X,"" and one of the ""particles"" you can discover is the X Boson, you could say that's a good spot to end off if you don't want to go for 100% completion.All this is made more difficult by the fact that the levels range from easy to begin with to extremely unique and difficult in their own regards. An example of one of the levels:The X Boson level is actually rendered in wireframe, making a lot of it quite challenging.There is no real plot to the game, though the characters are quite cool. There's a man, a woman, and a robot. Personally, the robot (Keiro is its name) is my favorite to play as.The controls are tight, responsive and easy to get used to. You only need 3 buttons: left, right, and up. Hold the buttons for longer, the longer you jump, and if you press a direction key you'll move a lane over in that direction. Different levels have different numbers of lanes too.The graphics are quite nice, they're not complex but they're eye-catching and nicely stylized. There are no actual quality or graphics options though you have the option to lower or mute the audio, to play in fullscreen or windowed. The game is not very resource intensive at all, and you can run this at 60fps 1080p on fairly low-end hardware.I also like to listen to my own music while playing it, which seems to improve my performance a bit, the soundtrack in the game isn't that great."

THIS GAME IS TERRIBLE AND STUPID AND FRUSTRATING AND TERRIBLE.Okay, now that's out of the way, I must say this game is amazing. It will make you want to punch someone on occasion, but that's okay. When you realize that there's only 18 levels, you might think that the game will be beaten in 10 minutes, but nooooooooo. Even after 80 tries, I still haven't beaten one of the first levels. This game is so addicting and simple, that you need to buy it NOW. Especially when it's on sale like I did. Best 74 cents I've ever spent. But seriously, as much as I love this game, and as many times that I laugh at Keiro's ingenious design, there are a few flaws. But they're just a few gameplay bugs that (hopefully) can easily be fixed. Every once in a while a jump won't register, or it will register, but for whatever reason you fall.

If you do not have the effort and determination/drive in order to complete a level, you lose. If you do not have excellent reflexes, you lose. You may be thinking as you read this: why should I play this game? Why should I buy a game for £1.99 on Steam when it is this hard? There are many games on this online gaming platform that are expensive (like Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, for example) and make you buy map packs/DLC in order to get the most out of the game. This game does not have DLC, or map packs, or even in-game purchases - all of this is built into the game for a fair one-time price of £1.99. This game does not even need DLC, for I can assure you that this game is like an orange: you can squeeze as much out of it as you want. There is no limit to how much fun you can get out of this game (or rather, tears :3) because it takes time to complete the levels of this game, and a lot of it. You can complete the first level and leave the game in your Steam library, unplayed, forever if you like, or you can decide to dedicate time and effort to completing every single level and beating the game, as well as getting a lot out of it. I have already completed this game, and will continue to rise up the leaderboards on this game until I have got the most out of it than I can, and you can too, for a measly price of £1.99.In conclusion, buy this game now and never regret it. :D 10/10"

That's not bad, but a lot of the sequences are designed in such a way that there's absolutely no way you can know what's about to appear unless you've run through it before.- Buttons sometimes register at the wrong time- The control scheme of pressing L/R to jump left/right and then holding it to stay up while you move forward is very confusing and takes a lot of getting used to.- Each level has a gimmick in the way that it spawns in the new platforms, and sometimes that gimmick makes it unduely difficult to tell where a platform actually is- The sequences are clearly designed with low speed in mind, so as you gain speed more and more of them will become impossible.  Most of this only happens after you've reached 100% and completed the level, but there's a couple in a couple levels that will end your game before you reach 100%.As a fan of runners I was able to overlook the bad and have a decent amount of fun with it.

So the game session will look like:start, jump straight, jump left, yes a blue platform, oops almost fell there, damn that crumbling platform, oh no the wall!

Perhaps two possible songs per level that are randomised could help with the minor monotony of it all.It's not the sort of game to be played for hours at a time.

And the levels are different enough from each other so that when you do beat one, starting the next one is like being thrown off the deep end all over again. Which is awesome.Took me 19 hours to beat all the levels, and I had already played the mobile version before quite a bit. But I'm an old fogie with slow reaction time so it might be less for most people. Speaking of the mobile version, I think that one was very well made, but some of the more faster and precise jumps are so much easier with a keyboard, so if you have this on your phone and find it a tad too hard, do try the computer version, well worth it.Overall perhaps my favorite ""small"" game ever, and definitely the best running game I know of.5/5"

Much more than that can start giving you a headache. The game looks like a dream you would have if you fell asleep in a high-level physics class. When I first found it I was reminded a lot of Super Hexagon, but I prefer Boson X beacuse while both games are about timing and pattern recognition, in Boson X there are more ways to accomplish the same goal and a bit more oppurtunity for recovery if things don't go exactly as planned. The soundtrack is repetitive so I reccomend muting the sound and turning on your own music.My partner is red/green colorblind and has a hard time identifying which platforms are energy, given that each level uses different colors and the colors invert after beating the level. But to all of you spectrally challenged gamers out there the pulsing pattern of the energy platforms versus the ""will-collapse"" platforms is different, so if you pay attention to that you should be good.All in all I would reccomend this game.

,Recommended,302610,27227052,"Posted: 24 November, 2016",all,LORD MJ,"Quite possibly the most addicting game I have in my Library.What makes Boson X so great? Its simple formula. You jump from one platform to the next, trying to land on the blue ones to fill up an energy bar. When the energy bar gets to 100%, you have completed the level. But you can keep playing to try and increase your score even further.Sounds simple? It is! Only it gets harder as you go. Much harder. First, the levels keep speeding up as your score gets higher, which makes an already hectic game even more hectic. Levels also get harder, much harder. The difficulty jump between the first and the last level in the game is astronomically high. Soon you will deal with more hazards. Platforms that drop once you step on them, platforms that come at you with speed and lightning bolts of DEATH are just a few examples of what you will have to deal with.Some levels are just pure evil! Platforms coming at different angles, entire levels spinning around and jumps that at first seem impossible to make. Boson X is a really fun ride from the very beginning to the very end. While we are on the subject, let's talk about replay value.I have completed this game in about 7 hours. And as of writing this review, I have 71 hours on record and I expect that Boson X will soon join the ""Over 100 hours"" Club. Why? Two words. Steam Leaderboards. This is the prime reason why I bought Boson X. I'm not a very competitive person by nature and most of the games I play are single player. But Boson X is an exception. The fact that I have a leaderboard where I can check my scores against other players provides a constant challenge for me. And it fuels the addicting part of the game. I want to go as high as I can on leaderboards. Even thought I have replayed a level close to 1k times, I still want to improve myself.That is incredibly fun. Having a lot of bad runs and then having one great run that pushes you up the leaderboard gives you a big a sense of accomplishment. And then you want more, more, more, MORE! :)The graphics are very simple, but they just work. Some levels look amazing, almost like you are in a different world.The sound design is just right. The sound when you run on the blue platform and your score increases is the best sound in the world.The music is simple. Each level has two loops that last about 15 seconds each. But the music works so well and is so charming that I didn't even notice how short the loops are. They just fit the game and what's going on the screen.I only have one minor complaint and that is that I sometimes get random FPS lag where my FPS drops from otherwise rock solid 60 FPS to around 40 FPS. The FPS lag usually clears up quickly if it starts in the middle of the run. And if the lag starts at the beginning of the run, I simply restart the level. I don't think that's the game, I think that's my machine and OpenGL being a bit funky. But It's nothing major. Otherwise, the game is polished and has no bugs.Still not sure if you want this game or not? Try the free version then! Boson X started as a free game, which later released on Steam with more content and Steam Leaderboards. So if you like the free version, get this one to support the amazing devs and get 12 more levels and 2 more playable characters. The price is fair compared to how many potential hours of fun you can get out of the game.PS: This game is hard by the way. Super hard. It's one of those games that you are going to pull out your hair while playing. If that sounds fun to you, get the game. You won't regret it."

Now it's even better even though Soundtrack pretty much repeats itself after compliting first set of levels.Pros:-Really Good Graphic-Randomized and interesting level designs-Catchy Soundtrack...Cons:-...that starts to repeat itself after 6 first levels-Some level layouts are impossible to passOverall this game is pretty interesting for those that like this type of games. I recommand getting it on sale you won't regret it ;)

This game spikes up the difficult with each level, but not so much that you'll immediately ragequit. It also has a leaderboard (which some #1 spots I think aren't legit, but anyway...) that makes you play the game past its final level.It's worth the buy, and it's quite cheap."
