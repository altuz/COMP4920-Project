I like the art and the music. It's charming.I don't usually play point and click games, but this one got my attention and the story is pretty dang spiffy to boot! I mean what would a point and click adventure be without story I guess? It's also on sale for it's first week on steam (Basically, seeing as it's supposed to be on sale for 6 days, 6 hours and 6 minutes at 66% off!) I mean. Not to say this needs to be on sale, I'd happily buy it full price. I just happened to stumble upon it on its first day on Steam.I'm looking forward to this studios future works.(After Finishing the game)This game gives you everything you need to finish the story. You just have to pay attention! A lot of ""Aha!"" moments I must say. The ridiculousness of the story is so great and charming, the ending? Wowzers I cannot wait to see where it goes! A few sad moments in the story too..."

I love adventure games and with the ""metalhead"" as the main character I really had a blast playing it. It has a few references to other video games and even a few horror movies. Not to mention, it's funny as heck!!! I would easily give it a 8 out of 10 and recommend it to any metal fan as well as any adventure game fan."

I doubt it will win any awards but you can expect maybe 6 hours of light hearted entertainment from an old school point and click.Don't be put off by the simple art style or the lack of voicing. The best bits of the game come from the conversation between the eccentric characters and well designed (almost exclusively) logical puzzles. There were enough good one-liners to keep me chuckling all the way through. Some people may be put off by the amount of toilet humour but I wasn't.Two negative points:Sections of the game had some annoyingly repetetive music.The interface used 4 interaction types: look, use, walk and talk. Just like most point and clicks  did back in the 90s. I actually wish more games had this but the designers of this game got a bit fussy over how big the hotspots were so you might find yourself stuck for a while even when you've been trying to do the right thing.There are a bunch of references you won't get if you didn't play such things as 'Leisure Suit Larry'.  I didn't play it so there were a lot of moments where I was a bit confused.I definitely recommend this to point and click fans"

It's what a point and click game should be, short, simple, and easy to use. The humor is witty, the story is interesting and the characters are enjoyable, but what makes Metal Dead so fun is the freedom for the player to explore and discover which would leave you at over the 4 hour mark.  Grab a soda and a snack because all you need is the mouse and a relaxing day to discover the special treat that is Metal Dead."

There's no voice acting. It's not a game for everyone.Butit does have something that a lot of modern games lack: character. It embraces the metal music theme (not unlike Double Fine's Brutal Legend) and it's continually funny, although in a dark, macabre way most of the time.So if you want a straightforward game to waste a few hours with and you enjoy bad puns, pixelated gore, and absurd situations then Metal Dead is probably worth a quick play through. At least at the typically low price it's usually on sale for."

The music is fitting to say the least, but maybe not to everyone's liking.The main reason this game should definitely go on your wishlist is that its extremely funny, going from nods to zombie-apocalypse cliché's to visual humour to the wackiest dialogue in an adventure game since Curse of Monkey Island. Trouble is though that the game does lag at times, but if you can look beyond that and the flash-graphical look thenyou have something unique to enjoy.Personally, I'm waiting (im)patiently for the sequel."

Time-savers such as knowing when you no longer have anything to do in a room, and a guide that often prods you on the right path keeps this from getting stale or frustrating.Expect a solid story with neat characters, backed up by consistent art and sounds.

Don't let the look of this game fool you, it's actually extremely challenging and very well thought out. Each task you have to complete will take time, thought, and effort as you scout this building from bottom to top looking for the answer.

Upon checking the store page I thought -- ""This looks like a funny, tounge-in-cheek, point/click zombie adventure game."" -- and that's what it is. Neither mind-numbingly hard nor vapidly easy (actually quite 'goldilocks just-right' in the difficulty department), the game doesn't revolutionized the genre or anything but it DOES tell a fun and interesting story, and for something so low-frills actually has some interesting characters. I didn't expect much, but my expectations were well exceeded. Only took me a couple of sessions to finish it, but I have no regrets -- I've been burned on steam before by games promising retro-thrills and substance over style -- this is not one of those games. It stands well on it's strengths and delivers on it's promises. It was fun, interesting, and a good ""candy"" play -- a puzzle game for a relaxed sunday where you won't need a walkthrough, just a little focus and dedication to get the job done. I wish more games like this would get made - value titles that are like the free-fare on newgrounds, but cranked a little further, a little longer, and a little better. No regrets. Would play the sequel! <3"

After Steam's latest update, I ended up having to reinstall a large portion of my library (dont ask).  So, I was browsing the list, and came across it again and realized I had never tried it out.  So, I fired it up...and played for three and a half hours straight.  Short? Yes, but for under a buck an hour it was pretty good fun.  I wouldn't have minded it being harder, or longer (cue obnoxious Ronnie comment here) or maybe had a couple more off the beaten path achievements ( think there were only 3-4 you wouldnt get through normal game progression), but overall it really was a fun little point-and-click adventure game.   I will absolutely be keeping an eye out for other games by this studio."

I can't reveal spoilers obviously, but it's worth 5 bucks to sit down and just try and play it.It has a certain charm to it in the way that it's drawn and it both can be fun to just look at and can be seen as rather bland. In some instances, the characters look great for how simple the crayon-simple designs are, others not so much like the head security guard. Just something about him seemed off in design.The puzzles are good but seem random with some of their answers and solutions however I was able to figure them out eventually. It strikes me really as a game you'd give to your kids if it didn't have some adult themes. But I do look forward to an eventual sequel.Overall Review? It's a simple couple hours of clean, harmless fun with corny jokes and silly characters with an okayish ending. The game looks alright and it didn't bug out at all and I tried everything I could think of. Overall, solid.Note: Okay odd, it said I have no time on record but I clearly beat the game and got all the achievements."

Simple, brutal and engagingly to the point. I could go on about how charming this game is and in depth, but I would like to avoid repeating myself too much. Do allow me to pinpoint the one thing that piqued my interest from very early on in the game, though.Malcolm- The character development on him is done gradually and elegantly in game without interrupting the pacing of the on-going storyline or being spotlighted and forced to the front. The opening with him and Ronnie is fashionably strong and comfortably digestible. It subtly left hints on him as a character aside from exhibiting his main traits which are unconventional for most who share the major label with him and he lives carelessly- almost obliviously- with that. The fact that him being pleasantly cosy with his own person and with his own identities easily brings out the maturity of the character- Which is one thing I enjoyed the most in this game.As for Ronnie, it’s difficult to say this without spoilers-He’ll be there in the encore. Mal might not have fixed him a new car, but one does not need an automobile to be automatic."

You're never really wandering around wondering what to do+ Silly plot (if you're in the mood for something light and silly!)- A few very minor bugs - sometimes music would stutter from one screen to another, and occasionally if I alt-tabbed out of the game or went to steam, when I came back the dialogue text had stopped working- No voice acting.Great stuff for the price, well worth a look if you like point and clicks.8/10 would METAL again."

Itcanget boring after a little especially if you don't know what to do, the resolution is small, and cannot be changed. It lags/stutters randomly... repetitive music to the point of extreme annoyance... but other than that, it is pretty good. I enjoyed the dialogue, although sometimes it went by too fast. Plot twists, references, gore, a severed head!Some people have negative feelings with 'no voice acting', but I don't; lets me read the characters the way I want them to be. I just wish the text stayed on screen for a fraction longer.The art style is Good. It reminded me of the flash games I'd play at school during lunch. It's not bad, just seemed lacking in something.Animations were meh, but good enough I suppose.Navigation:  You are given 4(+1) options for interacting: Look, Use/take/etc, Talk, Walk (and using items from inventory on objects in the room-- Standard in P&C). You have to right click to cycle through each one and it can be rather annoying; often over-click and select the wrong one. Get used to it eventually, but still get the odd extra click so I have to cycle through them again just to talk to someone. **I'm not a huge fan of Point & Clicks.Sound: Music sounds like something you'd get from DOOM. Pretty good soundtrack, but extremely repetitive. Sound effects are decent.Story: Plot-twists for your plot-twists.Other notes: Random lag/stutters can be annoying. Manual save system, so save often.* Only takes about 2-2.5 hours to beat. Maybe less if you follow a guide/know what you're doing.Easy 100% achievements if you're into that..

So I trudged through this entire game in hopes it would end soon, which is always a bad sign.Granted, I laughed once or twice, I enjoyed the type of animation of the game, and the very end of the storyline was good - But nothing was enough for me to feel I could genuinely recommend this title.

Funny enough it came out too and the car will crash. You will survive the crash but your friend has died. You will meet a crazy scientist and he has manage to ""revive"" your friend but only his head is able to talk. So you will have to drag him(his head) with you on your adventure and he will help you out.Story is meh.Music is repetitive and meh.Save and load game.Extra options at the top.It has humor/funny jokes and talking, sometimes a bit odd though.Animations are not super fantastic but they get the job done, i suppose.Really Short game.The graphics are drawn made, like it has been done in paint. (Flash game graphics) and is not really detailed or amazing.Not scary.Other thingsYou can't lose or die in this game, because he will say something to prevent you by killing himself when near a zombie.I have tried this and he will said something like this ""i don't want to be near them"".If you play the game window mode and you are making the screen unactive. Like clicking something on the background, The game will be paused.Once you are totally done with a floor, Your friend will tell you something that you have to leave that area and go somewhere else instead.

Personally, I liked the game, but I would only recommend it for die-hard graphic adventure fans who are also partial to horror comedy. (In this case, I totally fit the target demographic.)The Good: Fun, engaging zombie comedy plot -- it plays like the b@stard child of Shaun of the Dead and Maniac Mansion. The story wisely puts characters ahead of gimmicks -- it does not require familiarity with *specific* aspects of zombie lore or heavy metal culture to enjoy. The big reveal in the end made the gameplay feel worth it.The Bad: The gameplay is almost never time-sensitive and doesn't quite capture the dread and tension of an ongoing zombie apocalypse. The puzzles lack challenge for veteran adventure gamers. Minimal replay value once you've finished it.The Ugly: The stylized character design -- heavily influenced by Jhonen Vasquez (Invader Zim, Johnny the Homicidal Maniac) -- is a niche taste.

One part Maniac Mansion mixed with zombie Apocalypse and Wayne's World and Shaun of the Dead. Great sense of humour, challenging but not impossible puzzles, lots of commentary. Only difficult part, I found, was the final scene which is very heavily reliant on knowing how a certain movie ends with little time to figure it out.9/10.  I just think it needed some more dangerous situations like the final puzzle to keep players on their toe and add a little more heightened danger. I'd buy this for a friend (I did!).Very happy to see Part 2 will be released 2015. Get this for the current Winter Sale, it's a steal!"

The puzzles are unexpected and well placed, the atmosphere is outrageous and funny, the price is low, and it is a relaxing game to play. I noticed that I always had a smile on my face while playing and I didn't have to put much effort into playing because it is simple and fun. Now, just like every other game, there is some room for improvement. I found that at some points the dialogue was quite boring. A voiceover would be beneficial. Overall, I think this game is great, short, and harmless entertainment for a reasonable price. 7.5/10 I also made a youtube video if you want to check out first hand gameplay:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KypeAldS2o&feature=youtu.be"

Succeeding with AGS demands a lot from the writing department, and this is where Metal Dead shines.The story follows the exploits of two metalheads in the middle of an zombie outbreak, and is just about as anarchistic that can be imagined from the premise. The game does not skimp on the gore, but it's all presented with a deftly light and funny touch and endearingly crude graphics. In fact, the game's sense of humor is its strongest asset: The dialogue and writing is generally quite funny and pokes a lot of fun at various pop and alternative culture phenomenons.The puzzles are surprisingly logical as well, which does mean the game is a bit on the easy side. I don't really see that as a negative thing, however - It keeps the narrative moving and the jokes incoming, and Metal Dead is above all entertaining throughout its duration. It's not quite as laugh-out-loud funny as the Ben & Dan games, but worth experiencing nevertheless. Rough on the outside, but beats a lot of the generic adventure bulk put out by actual publishers with ease."

In Metal Dead you take on the role of Malcolm. He and his buddy Ronnie are driving through the zombie apocalypse   and crash theyre car near a building. When they enter they find out that theres a helicopter on the roof and theres a pilot which can take you some place safe. So its up to you to clear a path to the roof and escape the zombie madness. So how is Metal Dead ? Its probably the best adventure game i have ever played. The game is a great omage to the classics and its probably one of the funniest game i have played too. The game is quite simple for the most part but some puzzles did leave me scratching my head because you really need to remember what kinda stuff is lying around that will help you. When you enter the building you find out youre not alone and theres a bunch of people who are survivors staying in the building and trying to stay alive. Some of them are weird and some of them scary but it always is funny to see what they have to say. So now for the pros: the game is beutifull to look at and the hand drawn enviroments look great. Outstanding soundtrack. Well thought out puzzles. Funny and Smart writing, Now for the cons: Short. Overall Metal Dead is an outstanding game and i suggest you play it no matter what.

Unfortunately however it doesn't really live up to this promise either as a game or as a humorous take on the genre and subculture. The game itself is only a few hours long which for the price is about right, but during those three or so hours it doesn't really do much. Your character simply progresses from room to room picking up items and collecting elevator access cards from other characters in a rather dull manner with uninteresting and sometimes annoying controls, making for a rather drab playing experience. This could easily be at least partially salvaged by the story, aesthetic or humour the game clearly aims for but it doesn't really nail this either. Jokes are very surface level and basic but lacking the raw punch to actually produce real laughs. It has a couple of mild smirk-worthy moments, but nothing inspiring anything more and a couple of comments made by characters are somewhat questionable. Dialogue isn't exactly invigorating, characters are stereotypical without actually making jabs at those too much, and most disappointingly of all the comical look at metal itself it seems to suggest is nothing to write home about. Once in a while the two main characters will refer to something as ""brutal"" in a Metalocalypse-esque fashion and South Park-ish usage of metal to drive away enemies is central to the climax (in fairness the root explanation of the zombie apocalypse is more creative than many, if a little random), but anything beyond that which would resonate with members of that subculture is painfully lacking, and an ending comment by one character on how using image to define yourself and your deeds is no worse than being mindless undead just comes across as tacked on, ill thought out and a little preachy with absolutely nothing coming prior to set up or question the issue. Ultimately it's not an awful way to spend a small handful of hours especially for the price but where there was potential to make something unique, entertaining and memorable there's a merely serviceable game with underwritten jokes and subtext and a whiff of missed opportunity."

Which is nice because that means you don't end up back tracking as much as you would otherwise. Worth the fiver in my opinion.

The BGM isn't metal enough yet still enjoyable.3. A talking head. All you need, is a talking head. Loved it.4. Enjoyable length. Neither tedious nor short-lived.Negative:1. Slightly slow and repetitive at times for someone with a short attention span.2. Some steps seems rather unexpectable, a guide was needed at times for me."

This game is horrible and awesome at the same time.At first sight the graphics look like they've been done by a 10-year old with MS Paint. The music is annoyingly repetitive and can't be turned off (the setting in the configuration doesn't do anything), the font is horrible and just on the border of being unreadable, there is no voiceover (thankfully?) and even the controls are a bit clumsy.But wait, despite all that, I enjoyed every moment of playing it, because the epic and over-the-top story, the insane and funny things you have to do, the funny dialogs and everything else completely outshine the horribleness. Actually, I'm pretty sure the horribleness was done on purpose because while the drawings are ugly, they are consistent across the whole game and everything is perfectly recognizable, made with a lot of effort to make it look ugly and appealing at the same time. Only a great artist can draw something so beautifully ugly.Highly recommended with or even without a discount."

Dialogues are quite funny, characters are loveable and the story is rich enough to keep you going until the very end."

You probably won't need to use a guide for any of it if you're experienced with these types of games.Great story and writing. I enjoyed the simple but effective art style. Very humorous and memorable characters. A great game to spend an evening or two with. Definitely recommended for fans of the point-and-click genre!
