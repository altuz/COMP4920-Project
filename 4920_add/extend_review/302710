Blaze rush is an action racing thriller designed to test your Mario Kart capabilities from an angled top down view. For something so simple, the game is ensured to keep you coming back to play again and again.BlazeRush is a violentracing gamewith extremely simplistic racing controls. There is no specific button to break as acceleration is achieved by moving the left joystick in the direction you'd like to go. There is an arrow drawn to indicate which way you are pointing the joystick. Three main attributes are given to the vehicles which are mass, acceleration, and handle-ability. The three are self explanatory but depending on how you like to play (dangerous vs pre-cautious) will determine which vehicle you choose. Each vehicle is made with a different purpose.  Some are tank like and slow, but are heavy and hard to knock around. Some are hover vehicles and are quite fast, but fly easily when they get hit. The hover vehicles feel like the dominant ones to me but I have noticed online four wheelers are the go to choice. Once you choose a vehicle, it's time to choose a race type. In King of the Hill, the winning player simply has to hold the lead. Deathmatch requires you to be first again however there is a giant steam rolling chasing behind you. Fail to keep up or stay ahead and you'll soon be squashed. This game mode is the best one in my opinion as it's last person standing. The last game mode is racing, where obviously the goal is to come first at the end of doing a set amount of laps. Players are able to choose game type and map when starting a game and after completing a game. This sort of UI keeps everything running smooth jumping from event to event.Playing local co-op mixed in with a few people from online adds another dimension to the game AI's couldn't do. It is extremely funny to come across different play styles of gamers that race online. None the less though, I've seen the AI's take some crazy risks that I would consider absurd. Usually, they play it safe by toeing the line but I've caught a few AI's trying to jump ramps and even over turns to beat me. There aren't numerous power ups like Mario Kart but the essential ones feel there. There are two main power up types, nitro based and weapon based. Nitro based are different as some will provide quick acceleration for a short period of time while some are gradual acceleration over a longer period of time. Weapons come in the form of bioacid that slows the player down, a Star Wars looking plate dish push force, machine gun that fires numerous times, a homing missile that slowly closes in on the target in front of you, and a saw blade that spins vehicles out of control. Power up drops are consistent throughout events.Graphicsand design are completely suitable to the atmosphere and game play surrounding BlazeRush. The tires bounce appropriately and the collisions feel excellent. Only complaint is when turning into someone at the start, it doesn't feel as though you can steer them off course by pushing them. It does work when the game picks up and the speeds are different but can feel awkward when first starting a race. Explosions are well done and re spawn graphics and times are excellent. There is even a horn that sounds in deathmatch when the steam roller begins it's speed tirade.Soundsare graphics deliver exactly what they are meant to bring, excitement and suspense when spinning out of control.I would highly recommend this game on everyone's library, for a good sale price of course :). For the full price I bought four copies of the games, so may not be a bad idea to wait. The fact that you can play local co-op and play online simply shows these guys care. Even if you don't have a buddy to play with, the single player campaign will satisfy your one player needs before jumping online to cause some havoc. Everything seems like it was done right here and done with proper attention and care.For future development perhaps add more weapons and game modes? Maybe even add something that disrupts the terrain? There are some cool maps that were designed, would be nice to maybe integrate them with the attacks.Indie Rating : 8.8/10RATING : 7.65/10GameplayBStory / CampaignBVisuals / User InterfaceBSounds / MusicBReplay-abilityB+OverallBScreenShotsDifferent game modes and screen before playing the next race.

This is the same style game and it is still a blast to play.Gameplay: I use an 360 controller. You can pick up and play right away. Controls are easy and response is great. After that you just race and blast the other drivers. There are different game modes, so far I love the race with the giant spiked roller that crushes you if you fall behind.Graphics: nothing crazy realistic but it is not a realistic kind of game. They look just fine and work well for this arcade style game.Music: I'm a bit biased here as I loved Rock'N Roll Racing back in the day and part of that was the great tunes. I don't really notice the music in this game. I will generally mute it and run a play list of classic songs that sound good on the road.Multiplayer: There is online play but not many games available. I think this game thrives on local play. You get the same kind of feel as playing mario kart or mario party mini games, very competative but fun.All in all, if you like fun race games I recommend this one. Two thumbs up!"

I bought it to try out on my Oculus Rift DK2 and it instantly became my favourite experience to date.The graphics are perfect for VR and the current resolution limitations of the DK2. The car models and tracks are detailed and nicely stylised, while the explosions and smoke effects are just stunning. I feel very immersed in VR and it worked perfectly first time and without any tinkering.The controls, physics and handling have clearly been refined a lot during development as they are spot on. The music is OK, but could do with a bit more variety. The tracks are fine but I would like to see some more creative designs and / or a level editor in the future.Multiplayer is great but there doesn't seem to be too many people playing online at the moment. I've only managed to play online twice (probably 20 odd races in total) but everything was smooth and incredibly addictive.I would recommend this game to everyone with a DK2 as it is a fantastic experience in VR and the developer deserves a lot of praise and support for their efforts!"

But in the end, the game was very disappointing to me.The feel of the driving is pretty bad imo. There's no sense of speed or momentum. You just simply point the analog stick in the direction you want to go (there are no separate buttons for accelerating and braking). Also, the horrible catch up mechanic ruins the competitiveness of the game. There's no point in trying to lead the race until the last section of the final lap. Why do we even race multiple laps if only the last one matters?! Mashed is still by far my favorite local multi-player racing game."

You can either play offline with bots or even splitscreen with up to four friends. Or play online multiplayer with 8 others around the world! This game brings back the true arcade racing experience but still feels very unique. This reminds me a lot of Rock n' Roll Racing. Where you and 3 other racers battle it out to achieve victory. There's 3 gamemodes on BlazeRush; Race, which you go around the track and fight your way to first place. King of The Hill, where the winner is the person who's stayed in first place the longest (50 seconds). And last but not least, Death Race, where you and others fight to be the last alive, while a giant combiner is behind the track destroying anyone who is in last place.The game runs very smooth. My PC specs are not relatively made for gaming, but I get no frame loss. Even when there's 8 people shooting each other with rockets in a chaotic manner.One of the cons I found is the lack of people actually playing the game online. Which is a total let down because this game will never get old when it comes to playing with friends and sharing some laughs. I just can't seem to find anyone online.I hope more people buy this game.

,Recommended,302710,16466068,"Posted: 17 June, 2015",all,Bouillie,"Blazerush is an excellent game. It's a fast-action party racing game, mixed equally between Micromachines and Rock'n'roll racing. Did I just mention two of the most beloved fun racing games of the 90' ?You race on about 15-20 tracks using different weapons and boost to slow down your opponents. There is a single player mode, but it's not where Blazerush shines. It's by pluging 4 controllers (or up to 8 if you're playing online) than the real fun begins. There are 3 race modes : Race, King of the hill and Death race. Race is a classical, not so interesting mode. In King of the hill, as you might guess, you need to stay first a givin amount of time to win. The best mode in my opinion is Death race, where you're chased by a giant tank that will destroy you if you linger to much behind. You're forced to go forward, but being too much forward leaves you at the mercy of your opponents.There are 16 vehicles available with different statistics (Top speed is the same for everyone) : Acceleration, weight, control. You will find 5-6 different weapons et 3 types of boosts. One good point is that each enhancement is displayed on the car, which permits you to see immediatly if your opponent has a dangerous weapon without looking at the HUD.ProsGood controlsA variety of vehicles, but quite balancedMany weapons, but no mario blue shell. Each weapon is deadly, but you can react to them.Easy to join a game : Plug a controller, press start, your car appears immediatly.Decent netcode for online gamesFUN !ConsNot enough players online...Since we bought that game in january, we play almost every lunch break. it's a really underrated game.

The controls are really easy to learn, since you only have to steer, shoot, and use a nitro boost. The gameplay isn't exactly the most original in the world, but it takes all of your favorite tabletop racing games from the past and adds a ton of polish, solid controls, and plenty of fun modes to choose from.If you have ever played Mashed (Drive to Survive), Micro Machines, Rock n' Roll Racing, RC Pro AM, or anything similar, then you will feel right at home. Using an Oculus Rift with this is so good it gives you an advantage, since you can look around the track to see upcoming turns and threats more easily. When playing in VR, it makes you feel like you are playing with remote control cars and sitting right next to the track. VR doesn't have to be in first person, and this is an awesome example of how anything can work with it.My only gripe is the compatibility with Oculus Rift is a tad clunky to configure. You have to set the Oculus Rift to ""Extended Mode"" in your settings and set your headset as ""primary display"" in your Windows display setting. Once you do that you will be good to go.

I actually enjoyed it more than Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed.Basically you are racing through all these sweet-looking places, with 3-7 other cars, while frantically collecting weapon and boost powerups and mowing down everyone in your way.1 of the key mechanics of the game, that I've never thought I would enjoy, but I actually really do, is that you are never ever truly safe in front. Boost powerups would be constantly be dropped for the trailing racers, and if you fall back too much/get destroyed, you would be automatically be teleported forward a bit after a few seconds.So this translates into such a chaotic mess of a race in which you have to gun down the guy in front and evade that heat-seeking missile with quick zig-zags and body-block the car directly behind you and nudge the car beside you into the cliffs and oh ♥♥♥♥ you just run into your own bouncing saw it's crazy.Graphics are good. Physics are good. Hell, even the AI is good, knowing precisely when and where to shoot you so that you're chucked down into the abyss as you round that corner. I actually enjoy watching AI racing against each other, which is a first in racing games for me.The single-player career mode is quite meaty, in which you are introduced to new game modes/weapons/boosts stage by stage, which I clock at about 25 hours to finish due to the trophy system. Then there's the party mode, in which you can play multiplayer locally vs human/bots, or online. Unfortunately there are too few actual players at the moment, which is a shame, since I really enjoyed the local multiplayer.Anyway, if you end up getting it, the first thing you should do is go into Options and change the Video -> Camera tracks -> Local Players only. Trust me, it's better this way.TLDR: Blazerush > Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed. Get it."

I'd give the left-side of my man-hood (or pay it's equivelant weight in gold ... about $50) to see this game achieve the multiplayer mayhem of Mario Kart, but with the graphics and gameplay you've created (with, of course, VR support)."

,Recommended,302710,13894797,"Posted: 8 January, 2015",all,BOLL,"Oh man, first Toybox Turbos in VR, then this? I'm blown away.First, I played this on a TV with my brothers, I gifted it to my brother who had brought his gaming laptop over Christmas. It was fantastic fun to walk through the single-player portion playing co-op. Sadly this mode is not available for online play, but multiplayer is basically the same thing as single when it comes to game modes and levels. This in contrast to Toybox Turbos which only has one mode in multiplayer.After the Christmas break, I've now played the game again in VR, now on my own Steam account so I do have more actual play time than reported. Right now I have the last level left in single player (so hard alone!), otherwise I've gotten through all levels with at least one cup, most with more cups. The progression is nice, you unlock new cars by getting score and new races by winning cups, which happens automatically when playing :)In multiplayer you have 3/4 of the vehicles from the start, so it works just fine to jump straight into that. The most extreme vehicles have to be unlocked by collecting score, which I did in single player... not sure if the score collected in multiplayer is actually counted towards unlocks... as I went to multiplayer first after finishing single :)So, on to the VR implementation and experience! This game performs perfectly on my 970, which it should I guess, it's a pretty new card. But I was able to run it at a full 75 Hz in VR, 2x supersampling, while recording in 60 fps. No issues. The entire game has been adapter to VR, when booting the game you are surrounded by video screens with a menu in front of you.When racing, the interface there also works very well in VR, not that I look at it very much but you have a map at the bottom and icons where expected, again I never have time to look at stuff I just turn my head and look around me if I want to get my bearings :)So, what have I found amazing in VR? The graphical fidelity is great, there are tons of particles through explosions, smoke and other effects, which looks great. The vehicles themselves has lots of detail, and it's very fun to just pause the game and look closer on the different machines. The large crusher in the death-race mode is especially interesting as you can read text on it and see walkways on top of the huge engine, just brilliant :)Fun stuff that happened, I got the camera begind the death-race crusher, and it felt like I got the thick exhaust smoke in my mouth :D Nutty! It's also pretty great when stuff fly at you, vehicles that are launched in the air and exploding into lots of tiny pieces... feels like being inside a small miniature firework show! Fantastic :DSome people has complained about the control method, which is a bit unique, you just aim in a direction and you drive there. If you've driven vehicles in Halo it's pretty much like that, just with a fixed camera. It's pretty key though as when you get shot at, your vehicle is all over the place! If you play with a keyboard you have normal steering, and I found it much harder to get going in the right direction after getting hit. Again, you might not find this intuitive, but I greatly enjoy it!Conclusion. If you like top-down racers or just fun party games, this is a title for you! If you want a great VR experience, this is that too! I would never have heard of this game, probably, unless they added VR! Lucky they did, because it's a great little game :D"

The camera keeps zooming in and out depending on where YOU are.  It keep trying to keep the entire group of racers in view so if they are far apart between 1st place and 8th place, the camera zooms out, and it's hard to see at that point, especially if you are #8.2. Since the game wants to keep all 8 cars in view, and can only zoom out so much, it has this mechanic in which it bubble warp your car up if it falls too much behind.  This reminds me of a very old racing game called Motoroader back on the TurboGrafx 16, except the mechanic works there as there is no zooming in and out randomly on the screen.  And sometimes if you are turning a corner when it happen it just bounce you off the track all together.3. The controls on the keyboard and on the game pad is totally different.Keyboard - you use left and right to turn the car like most racing gameGamepad - your car Go towards the Direction you are Pointing to, which I don't like at all.  Wish there is a way to make it more like the keyboard controls.4. Can't remap the controls5. Power pickups gets knocked away if you already have one picked up and unused.  Which is great for the cars up front but horrible for the cars in the back.  it's hard enough to pickup anything when there is nothing since the cars infront of you grabbed them from you, but even if they can't use it, they still pushes them out of the way so you can't keep up in the same lines as them and hope to pick up the items.  Maybe make it so the cars that can't pick up anything just runs thru the power-ups instead of hitting them and knocking them away."

There are much better and cheaper examples of this kind of game.I saw the word ""accessable"" touted around in the marketing materials for this game. The truth is that there is extremely little to this game and what there is is overly simple and unapologetically repetitive.Sure it has that ""can't stop playing"" vibe... for about an hour, then the gameply becomes mindnumbing and you realize that you're executing the exact same meaningless actions over and over again and no matter how prettily it's been dressed up they cant hide how quickly this piece of fluff loses it's appeal.It is offensively mediocre and feels like a made for profit game."

Take what you can from there then make it modernized and better.-- what to..NOT expect from it if comparing with ""Rock and Roll Racing""--- Buy cars--- Upgrade cars--- OP cars. Or if you remember Rock and Roll Racing, OP car. :)--- They didn't fill in what Rock and Roll Racing left us hanging with.- balance. Maybe too much of it. I just put it here cause I know It is it's own challenge and fun.- Has relatively more tracks than Rock and Roll Racing- local co-opThings i DON'T LIKE about this game:- Story mode sucks. > Game mode says story mode but the only time it acts like there's a story is in the beginning. The rest is just whatever.- Very small online community. > There's no other person playing online except you, apparently. :(- Bug showing up every race finish. > All through until the end you'll see this bug at the end of the race.- Bullcrap race types that persists until the end of the story mode. > Seriously annoying. When all you wanna do is race in laps while blowing up your opponents.- Some UI is just...ugly. > I don't get why they have to make it so hard for the player to choose the race type on multiplayer. I've really, really tried. I think you can't.Conclusion:This feels like an indie but not indie kind of game. Something that has potential to reach AAA space but after lift off some devs must have messed up that the game blew up halfway across the sky before it could reach it (Yeah, SpaceX just popped into my mind). Playing this on single player is OK. And yes, there are a lot more cons than pros posted on this review. Nevermind the hind of nostalgia for Rock and Roll Racing.

The single player campaign is fun enough chasing trophies and unlocking vehicles, and the local 4-player is done very well and a lot of fun for friends or families.Cons:It's not quite as in-depth as Rock'n'Roll Racing, truthfully.  You don't own a vehicle, you don't earn money and spend it upgrading your ride.  You can't (that I'm aware of) change the color you're assigned based on player #.

A few times I found myself flying through an over-track sign, but I suspect I was probably too close to the head tracking unit - you want to be sat back about 6ft with this for best effect! (Controller recommended therefore!) Having the ability to chose where you look on the track is an amazing benefit (and experience!), as when playing in non-VR, you sometimes find your FOV a bit limiting when you're leading the pack. Being able to sit forward a bit or look around other cars for the best view of your own car and/or the track is just bonkers. Not to mention the machine gun fire and rockets flying around :DEven in non-VR on a SteamOS (Read: Ubuntu with Steam on it) machine it runs flawlessly - A lowly Intel Pentium G620 and an AMD R7 250 (1GB) is more than sufficient to play this at decent frame rates at 1080p - which looks beautiful on my TV!Great job Devs!"

The Death Race mode quickly became a house favorite here.All in all, a fun updated remix of Mario Kart and R.C. Pro Am for NES. Great for screaming at friends, but quick and fun enough that it doesn't ever really turn to bitter frustration. Like most kart-racers there is rubberbanding to keep the racers from getting lapped, but it doesn't matter for this type of racing game which is about pulling off amazing upsets and glorious falures.

Lots of flames, explosions, cars rolling over and spinning all over the place while you race.  Combine that with colourful, detailed graphics and a bunch of awards for outrageous manoeuvres like being hit with your missile after propelling yourself forward with a rocket and you have a very fun game.   There are numerous vehicles which have various driving performances and a nice set of relatively short tracks. Its quick to load and the interface is snappy.  I do have some intermittent control issues. 7/10"

It is beyond doubt one of the best multiplayer games, which is fun as hell, and cheap as well. When the buddies come over, we always play some time with this, and you could say that this is getting more and more a classic game in our repertoire. Unfortunately though, the online player base is not as big as it could be, so the one thing which could make this game even better is to have an active community. Or free DLCs. :D"

On the surface it seems like a scaled up mobile game, but after playing it for a while I found that this was really a full fledged osimetric view racing game. I didn't like the 'point a stick in the direction you want to go' controls at first but grew to really like it. This way of control works perfectly especially when things get really nuts and I have trouble seeing my little car. I'm using the XBOX ONE wireless controller & dongle. The artwork feels a little generic but it's original and adds a nice touch to the game. It kind of reminds me of R.C. Pro Am in all the best ways. Also I like that the engine scaled up fine to my ultrawide 3440x1440 monitor just fine. I say engine because the menu's were streched. It doesn't effect the gameplay really but a little love to us ultrawide gamers would be cool.As I progressed through the races I found myself smiling, yelling, laughing, and retrying with a bug dumb grin. It's just ton's of fun. This game also seems to have very low system requirements. I was running MSI After Burner and my Radeon R9 390 generally sat around 350 to 420Mhz with the FPS locked to 60 and VSYNC on. I also had AA turned off. I never play with AA.Also while I have only played single player, I think this would be an insane party game. Makes me want to go get some more XBOX ONE controllers.One thing I forgot to cover was the huge variety in cars, and weapons. They are creative and fun. The game is just very well thought out and a total blast. Snag it! Even if it's not on sale."

Best enjoyed playing couch co op with friends.Really appreciate that they made Oculus Home keys available to people who had purchased before March 28th 2016, as I was initially a bit sore that that version got VR but not the Steam version (understand that the money to develop this was funded by Oculus) so that was a nice touch. If you do want to play it in VR, buy from the Oculus store though as you won't get a key for new purchases."

Therefore I was able to spend longer on it than other VR games.I now have a new gaming laptop and the CV1, so decided to revisit the title.Initially I was very disappointed that the developer dropped VR support through steam. Only allowing the version in the Oculus Store to have VR support. However:*** EXISTING CUSTOMERS GET A FREE GAME CODE FOR OCULUS STORE ***Just goto the Store Page, then News tab. You can redeem a code for the oculus store if you bought it when it was a VR title like me.It isnt advertised as VR in steam now. But if you bought it by mistake I believe Steam can offer refunds if you have minimal playtime and its a recent purchase."
