,Recommended,302750,10335246,"Posted: 3 June, 2014",all,Xevo,"This game is incredibly fun! The simple premise of turn based tower defense type gameplay where numbered cards must be combined and discarded to match the number of a selected group of attacking monsters grows deeper as the game progresses. Potions to add or subtract numbers from a monster's power combined with spells to move them around, stop them, or get rid of them entirely will keep you on your toes.As the numbers get bigger on enemies and cards, it gets tougher to make full screen clearing matches but it feels amazing when you do and you'll score tons of points as well! There is also a free play mode where you can jack the difficulty way up that is quite mind bending as well.This game is highly recommended if you like numbers puzzles and/or have kids who need to practice good math skills. Can't wait to see what else ends up in the game!"

Teaches addition, subtraction, and multiplication mostly with positive numbers, but a few negative numbers too depending on in-game circumstances. Short and mildly entertaining for people who are already good at math. Either way, well worth the buy regardless of sale status. I have no complaints about it."

Combining scrolls, using potions and adding monsters together is a blast. The production is already of a high quality too. The presentation is bright and cheery enough that children will enjoy it and yet not so cute that adults would feel childish playing it. In short, it's very enjoyable to play."

It's just so wonderful!!The game itself is a turn based, tower defense game involving math(addition & subtraction), and magic. The design is splendid; the art, the music, and gameplay are all kid friendly. For instance, some of the built-in mechanics will even gently guide younger children to the answers if they become stuck.There are a myriad of ways to clearing the monsters though. You can add spells together, and chain monsters together in various ways. You're also given potions with varying effects as you progress through the game, so there's a lot of creativity in how you beat each level. That creative freedom is what really gets me addicted. My favorite thing to do is take big risks, and let the monsters stack up a bit. Then unleash all the potions, and big spells in an attempt to get 'full clears'.  : )Story mode itself has numerous levels to progress through, and while you can revisit them at any time; there's also 'free play' mode with scaling difficulties. Oh, and each level is generated on the fly; so there's never any sequence to memorize. It's always going to be a new, and exciting challenge!A simply charming game for all ages; I definitely recommend it!"

While it's intended for kids, it's also good for low-impact gaming for adults when you're just not up to the concentration needed for platformers or combat.  It combines tower defense with addition skills, and can be surprisingly twisty! Fun without being laborious for short bite-sized pockets. You won't play this (probably) for an hour or five at a time, but for ten or fifteen minutes between online tasks or while waiting on downloads, it's really enjoyable."

The person(s) who made this game liked what they were doing, and it shows. Glad this went through James Recommends because I never would have found this otherwise. My 4 year old took to it immediatly and put a solid half hour into it and I saw improvement in her math skills clearly. I am going to keep an eye on whatever this company does in the future."

Add big numbers for big damage, don't go for easy stuff like 2 +3 or 5+15, that'll lead your kindom to ruin! Relearn how to Math fast and have fun at the same time.Don't, but I mean don't play this with your kids or any kid. Like games with online, the rating goes to M really fast as you curse at them for being so stupid and slow. You might even smack them... hard. I know I did. I regret nothing."

Played it with my first grader, and he couldn't get enough of it. We enjoyed working together to figure out the gradually more difficult calculations, and he yelled ""Boom!"" every time we managed to clear the board. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to other parents of grade school kids, even at full price. Kudos to the developers."
,Recommended,302750,11573073,"Posted: 6 August, 2014",all,[G@mer]But terd,"First Try on The Counting Kingdom.The video is here:http://youtu.be/2CzhcDk0fKIHaving a weak spot for maths games in general, I thought, I might give it a try.Before going into the gameplay, as always, we look at the options menu first.Being a unity game, the graphical options are in the launch window with your settings for graphical fidelity and resolution.Audio Options are ingame with sliders for SFX and Music.The gameplay itself is fairly simplistic and whenever a new element is added, it is well explained.Basically you try to match monsters(or the sum of combined monsters) with your spells which are also numbers.Since every level plays out differently there is no preset solution for the level, so you can find a better one.After each level your score is evaluated with a fairly well known system of 1-3 stars depending on your score.With that said, I would not be surprised if the game gets ported to IOS or Android later on.Apart from that I do not really have any more to say than the tl:dr.Is the game worth it? 10€ for (from what I have heard) fairly short game is quite a high price.Taking it into consideration though that this game is an educational game the price is pretty much right.My recommendation therefore is that if you want a maths game for your little ones, then go ahead and buy it.If you are an avid gamer though, I would wait until the game goes on a sale(~50%).So it is not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination, but the price point is a little bit to high, in my opinion."

He likes it. This game allows him to practice numeracy interactively.Unfortunately, we do feel that it's only mildly fun due to high engagement competition from the already massive gaming market. I suppose all games have huge competitions nowadays.It is still fun, nonetheless, especially if it can be integrated with other digital or online learning management. I do think the game deserves a sequel.This is my first time using it, so I will offer further, more useful feedback after we venture further into the game. :)"
,Recommended,302750,13606520,"Posted: 25 December, 2014",all,3beetles,"my son seems to really enjoy this game,  I enjoy it too but I wish it had harder and more complex levels. It is a good game for children wanting to practice addition with some small subtracting and ocasional doubling of numbers."
,Recommended,302750,13971380,"Posted: 13 January, 2015",all,IHNN,"I find it hard to decide whether to recommend this game or not, honestly.  I picked it up when it was on sale for $5 because I saw it on Extra Credits.  I figured it was a math game, and I like math, so it should be a fun little diversion.  It was, but that's where the problem comes in.  I beat the game in less than an hour.In terms of mechanics The Counting Kingdom is quite sound-everything works together, complexity and difficulty are added in nicely as the game progresses.  It all feels a bit same-y though.  The difficulty I also found to be a bit low until the wizard was introduced: then it had the wrong kind of difficulty, and I lost 2 towers on the final level (the only tower losses I took through the entire game) due to the wizard hitting a doubling tile and not drawing any ways to make 30.I wish you could cast spells greater than 30.  That would have added a lot.The game could have stood to be a bit longer, but I'm sure I'll get further playtime out of it with speedrun attempts.Even after writing the above I'm still not sure whether to recommend: it was a fun hour, but it's hard to suggest $5, let alone 10 for an hour of gameplay.  I'd suggest picking this game up if you see it 75% off or more, but I can't justify recommending it for much less than that in its current state."
,Recommended,302750,14995362,"Posted: 21 March, 2015",all,pfox,"I got this game to play with my 6 y/o and it's been great so far. She really enjoys it (although I wish we could customize the avatar to at least switch the gender, but hey this is progress). It's a challenge to find educational games that are entertaining to play and don't feel like shovelware. So this game is great.The UX is quite streamlined and feels targetted towards younger players. The tutorial levels are intuitive and gradual, as they should be. Even after the tutorial levels are complete, I feel like the game's AI is coordinating the presentation of available spells, potions and monsters to encourage abstract thinking and help the player, but I might be giving it too much credit.Overall I'm very glad I got this game for my child. My only apprehension is that it's yet another game where the protagonist is a white boy. And we wonder why women and minorities avoid STEM, heh."

The counting Kingdom was a great find.At first it reminded me of games like Plants VS Zombies but the Counting Kingdom is clever and fun in it's own unique way. The gameplay is simple enough for young kids to easily pick up and play but gives enough options to solve each problem diffently and keep things interesting for all ages. For some one that has only just started learning addition and subtraction it may progress in to bigger numbers a little to quickly but overall it has a nicely balanced paceing that keeps things entertaining as you progress.If the game was extended more variety in music, art and the inclusion of multiplication would be welcome. In this case, for the price and scope of the game it holds up very well."
