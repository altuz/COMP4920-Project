,Recommended,302790,12808535,"Posted: 5 November, 2014",all,Pretty Lucky,"A good, tight-feeling platformer that was well worth spending money on.It's a great improvement from Momodora I and II with better controls and more solid mechanics as well as a more coherent world. I don't like that it goes back to a linear style like Momodora I but at least in this case you can backtrack if you missed things.I hear a lot of people saying that this game is either too easy or too hard, and I really think these people aren't understanding a major element of the game: the items. There's a large handful of items that you can equip three at a time that affect your attacks and your characters' abilities. With these you can make your characteroutright broken, or a one hit wonder. The game can be played as you like it, and if Momo is too hard for you, you can play as Dora instead, who has one extra heart, seems to do a bit more damage and starts with the Dream Ring instead of having to find it. I've also heard people say this game is short (as Momodora games always are) but it took me about nine hours to finish doing everything and getting all the achievements, which I'd call reasonable for a game like this. Just running through once though? Yeah it won't take long.The bosses were all somewhat basic as usual, some even reusing patterns from Momodora II, but I still thought they were pretty fun. The areas are all vibrant, unique and visually sharp, the graphics are as smooth as always and the sound design as well, however I'd say I enjoyed Momo II's soundtrack a bit more.On the downside though this game haswaytoo many instant kills, pits and spikes sure, but also bombs. Explosions are a one hit kill and this gets frustrating later on when a lot of enemies have bombs. The slightest misstep in some areas can send you into a pit or explosion immediately, sometimes right after a room transition. It doesn't really add to the difficulty either, as checkpoints are usually nearby anyway.I also didn't care for the secrets. I really did enjoy finding the secret boss and how it was done in general but I found it all by accident absentmindedly and I wouldn't have if I hadn't just gotten lucky. There's also an achievement for saving a character before she dies that I frankly had to look up because I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to do (one item having a massively misleading description didn't help either).All in all I really enjoyed this game, it's a lot better than the previous games and shouldn't be judged by them alone.buy momodora 3"

Maybe just a bit frustrating when you dont know the controls and times. But after that I assure you. You will love this game.Since the start the intro music caught every sense of your soul with a cute music.Talking about dificult is very easy at the start. Well maybe not, is your choice.And maybe one of the bad things is: It´s very short.Personally I found this game as very entertaining. With at least a few more times to end the game.I admit I was playing it with Family sharing of my brother. And I has been got all the achievements...But I bought it.

76561198072535574,Not Recommended,302790,20235790,"Posted: 2 January, 2016",all,asiago,"Hard to give a thumbs up or down on this one - Momodora III is a well presented platform/action game, has a solid soundtrack and appears to offer a good challenge. But for all that, I find myself wondering if my time and money were well spent - its short length (less than 2 hours on my first playthrough, on Hard) isn't a negative by default, but Momodora's gameplay is soulless.There's plenty of classic platformers around Momodora's length, but these encourage careful progress, skillful play and an understanding of stage layout and enemy behavior. In short, they're worth revisiting, and become more satisfying when one understands its intricacies. One quickly realizes that Momodora doesn't ask for anything so strenuous. Here, players can just make a mad dash for the next healing point (3 screens away, guaranteed), save, and do it again until the end. Stages and enemy placement and behavior are as simplistic as they come, and bosses attack slowly (usually with one heavily telegraphed attack). There is no difficulty curve - if you can get through the first five minutes, you'll make it to the end.So Momodora will take less than two hours of your time, and less than five dollars out of your pocket. You'll see some pretty pixel graphics and have a soothing soundtrack (in ogg format) stashed in the game files, but the game you play will probably be forgotten by the time you head to the toilet. Is it worth it? The obvious wasted potential poisons the experience of the game itself - this could have been quite good, but when the credits came around I wondered if the developer was more interested in making the assets than the game. I recommend against it - I have enough games in my library that I certainly could have spent the time on better games. I imagine most people can say the same."
,Recommended,302790,11050038,"Posted: 3 July, 2014",all,CueZero,"Momodora IIIis the charming new installment in rdein's fast and fun series of action-platformers centered around the two priestesses of the game's namesake and takes a slight departure from the metroidvania styled Momodora II for a more straight-forward and accessible action adventure. While some may be disheartened with the change I was more than happy with the almost arcade-like progression making it an incredibly addictive and easy to pick up game that still retains all of the depth and flair of it's predecessors.There are still plenty of secrets strewn about the various levels for you to explore for and you'll have more than enough game-changing equipment to find for your journey, the platforming is precise thanks to simple controls, and the combat is lightning quick with a choice of split-second slashes or charged bullets for more strategic situations. The game can be very challenging, especially with the harder choice of sisters, since the enemy placements are very well thought-out and require some fast-thinking to deal with unharmed and the bosses will require lots of fast reflexes and coordination with their almostMegaman-like patterns.Fans of future-classic indie favorites such asCave Story, orNoitu Lovewill be instantly attracted to the visuals as there is a lot to adore here from the cute and offbeat cast of characters to the lovingly crafted backgrounds all with a touch of that nostalgic old school flair. The soundtrack carries the same retro appeal with it's soothing melodies that change and intensify with each new area, all-in-all creating a package that any fan of old school indie platformers should not be able to resist.The game is a short but sweet experience with lots of amazing creature designs and lore to learn.  Replayability here is extremely high and with it's secrets to find, multiple characters of varying difficulty, and diverse approaches to each boss the game clocks in at around an hour per play which in my opinion is just right as each level and setting changes often enough to stay engaging and not overstay it's welcome makingMomodora IIIan easily recommendable experience at it's affordable $4.99 pricetag."

You pay €2,- for it, and that's likely the average amount of hours spend on it. If not less.The Gameplay is linear, so it's not really a time where you would be stuck with something. and it's difficulity settings can range from invincible to insanity, which is quite a huge gap.If you want to try out the Momodora series, I rather recommend starting with Momodora: Reverie under the Moonlight first.And if you found that game fun and want to look for more of the series, then it'll be worth the details this game shows."

,Recommended,302790,24027784,"Posted: 2 July, 2016",all,ＣＲＡＣＫＹ大班,"Momodora III is a charming, little game.  Feels a lot like Cave Story, but with primarily melee (with a charged range) attacks.  There really isn't much depth to the game; no cut scenes, dialog is quick, one optional boss, and very few secrets.  You collect stars to buy a handful of different accessories.  No armor, costume or equipment changing.  Very lighthearted soundtrack.  For $2.00 (usually 0.99 during sales), I don't see the harm.  An enjoyable playthrough.Be warned, once you know your way around the map, the game can easily be completed under a half hour.  Bossess certainly have easy movesets- I recommend not reading any strategies or watching Lets Plays before completing."
,Recommended,302790,33788637,Posted: 25 July,all,PanfooToogre,"If you're interested in getting this game, I would suggest selling some cards on the Steam market and saving up the money in your wallet to buy this game. If you wish, however, you can spend the $2 to get this game.I got Momodora III because I was very interested in getting Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight and I wanted to try out this game first. While I am still interested in getting Reverie Under the Moonlight and I DO recommend this game, it didn't feel like anything that spectacular at times.Combat:The combat is very basic and apart from spamming your melee attack or shooting a few ranged attacks, there's not much you can do in terms of combat.Characters:The characters weren't that memorable because they are introduced very quickly and are rather rushed. The story isn't a key part of this game, however, so that can pass.Soundtrack:While the soundtrack to this game isn't as amazing as Shovel Knight's or Undertale's, I enjoyed it. The music was, at times, very relaxing. My favorite track was the track to the final level inHell. The music makes you feel so utterly depressed and pointless. It went extremely well with the snowy and barren landscape and it really asks the question- What is Hell really like? Is it the sensation of burning with other lost souls or is it a cold, lonely landscape that you can never escape?Bosses:Most of them weren't really that interesting or engaging. The combat is very basic so it the bosses can all be defeated the same way.Artstyle:The artstyle is extremely cute and I really love it. The enemy and NPC designs are very cute and unique and I love it. This is probably the greatest part of the game. This is probably what compels most players.Although I've been complaining a lot, my final complaint is about the final level. I put a spoiler notice when I talked about it before, and I'll do that again.The level in Hell felt kind of ruined by all the random monsters and the boss encounter before the final boss, the Goddess of Death. I felt like the level would have gotten its point across a lot better if it had been without monsters and had been the player simply walking alone through a bare landscape. I personally think it would have been better played out if the player just walks by themself through a landscape with, perhaps, dead monsters or NPCs appearing on the ground in a few select spots. When they reach the final boss, they kill them and the game ends. But, then again, this is just me being picky.Okay, so... What did I enjoy about the game?Well, I thought the atmospheres were very nice and, like I said before, I thought the soundtrack was very relaxing. The NPCs were, while rushed in their introductions, at least likeable. The game doesn't give you a defined purpose, which is nice. You can make any predictions or guesses, which I wish more games would do sometimes. You can also occasionally find secret items, which I wish there had been more focus on. The game feels like 25% of a Metroidvania style game. The artstyle is, as I said before, wonderful. You can tell the developer obviously put a lot of time into it and that's what I admire most about the game.Overall...Sure, I would recommend Momodora III. No, it's not the greatest game I've ever played, but it's worth playing and is a nice way to pass an hour or two when you're bored.6.5/10"

,Recommended,302790,11006972,"Posted: 1 July, 2014",all,Varia,"After playing the first two games, I was excited to see what was in store for Momodora 3. The game isn't filled with exploration as in Momodora 2, but it isn't as arcadey as the original game either.This game comes in two difficulties, Momo (hard) and Dora (Easy), each staring their own individual girl. The controls are simple, and leaves the player a lot of room to decide how to defeat a boss or get through a level. You can buy equipable items at one of the few shopkeeper locations, but even these won't make a big difference when it comes to facing a boss. Overall, the game gives you quite a bit of a challenge.The music is pretty good too, really fitting. Hellkite Drake brings a wonderful addition to the music, complementing Elektrobear from the previous installments. That said, Momodora 2's album was great also. You should check it out.For $5, you're getting a really nice game with a good amount of difficulty. The length of the game might not be enough to justify the purchase. My recommendation would be to play the first two games, since they are free on the dev's website. That way you get a taste of what to expect and have a good introduction to the series."

76561198166771313,Recommended,302790,29428194,Posted: 22 January,all,dstreet319,"Momodora III is a short platformer with elements from Castlevania that I have found to be really enjoyable. There are a total of 6 levels that should take 5 to 10 min. to complete, each have their own enemies and boss battles. You only have 2 attacks in the game, a standard slashing move and a charge attack. Both seem to do the same amount of damage so it ends up your strategy on how to take out enemies.Throughout the levels you will come across chests that will give you currency to buy items from a shop that can give you an edge in combat. You will get currency by defeating enemies (certain enemies drop more than others).  There are some secret areas as well as a level that will give you special items or a lot of currency.So if you want a Castlevania inspired game with good level design and no BS enemy placement that can take you around an hr. to beat I recommend this game. Its a pretty good game to speedrun as well!Rating 8/10"
,Recommended,302790,11011739,"Posted: 1 July, 2014",all,IHeartPie,"While not as open world as the game it draws the most simularities with, Cave Story, Momodora III offers the same tight combat while mixing some new features to keep the formula fresh.Gameplay boils down to either quick melee swipes or charged up ranged attacks. That's it. However, there are many ways to make the game play by your own rules. The game features a great deal of unique items to tailor your playstyle. Just from the first couple levels [small item spoilers], I found a speed ring that doubles your speed and damage intake, a sentient clone item, a life leech on kill item, a money magnet and many more.The game has quite a bit more if you take some time to explore it. There are secret nooks and crannies all over the place that nets you new items and all the story within the game are laced into the dialogues of the npcs.All the bosses after the first one offers a decent amount of challenge with different attack patterns for you to recognize and projectiles coming from every which way for you to dodge.In conclusion, if you like the powerful feeling combat from games like Cave Story and Vlambeer games [Nuclear Throne/Super Crate Box], then Momodora is right up your alley.Here's a video first impression for those interested:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anhFy4YqSWk"

,Recommended,302790,25071510,"Posted: 22 August, 2016",all,Joshyy,"TLDR:Momodora III is a basic platformer with captivating artwork/music, simplistic mechanics, and just enough variety best suited to keep you playing for a playthrough that will last no more than 2-3 hours in one sitting.Controls/MechanicsUpon start-up, the control scheme can be switched between controller and keyboard, but the game does not translate the keys to buttons when using a controller, so the controls required some testing in the first minute or so. The controls are simplistic to grasp at; you have your standard movement, slash button, charge for special attack, and menu buttons to equip accessories you find during your playthrough.The game allows you to choose two characters, which does not seem to affect the already bare-boned story that's in place. For anybody that's played a platformer, the controls, mechanics, and gameplay are self-intuitive; avoid obstacles/, take damage from foe on contact, slash foe X amount of times to kill, falling off = death, respawn at last checkpoint. The usual. At certain points throughout the game, you are required to battle a boss monster, which has a health bar quite larger than your normal NPCs. The bosses start simple with singular attack patterns and develop more as you progress during the game, never becoming overly complex, and easily readable after two-three tries.The platforming component was fairly simplistic; no overtly complicated tricks or puzzles, just regular platforming, trying to ensure that you don't die or else you'll respawn at your last checkpoint. Some enemy placements right in front of cliffs cause for a slightly frustrating time for the impatient player, but nothing that isn't easily overcomeable. Basic, average, but smooth/tight. Meets a standard.ImmersionThe music, background, and artwork are eye-catching and immersive with the layering of images to create a more deep environment. The lasting power isn't much and the visuals are likely not to be remembered beyond the first few days after playing the game.SummaryOverall, I was able to play through the game twice in less than 2 hours. The game doesn't require much for a 100% completion, and there isn't much playability after the first playthrough except for completion purposes. That being said, the game was cheap on purchase, has solid mechanics and contained artwork/music that was captivating long enough to complete the game and enjoy the cohesion between the different components."

Despite its simplicity and brevity,Momodora IIIpositively throngs with variety; the painterly vistas, fine chiptune soundtrack, and whimsical enemy roster are constantly shifting, and there are even a couple side-missions wedged in there -- one of which is a hidden boss, no less!  The story of this and the other games interlock, but the narrative is still fairytale-vague; there's enough detail for atmosphere and series branding, with the rest left up to your imagination.  That's fine with me, though.  I've always loved the ""rustically cosmic"" viewpoint of fairytale and myth, and if it's good enough for me, it's good enough for you!The physics were okay in the previous games, but one thing I really love aboutMomodora IIIis that Dora and Momo have a real sense of weight to go with their speed this time around.  They don't hop in unswerving Castlevanian trajectories or anything, but there's a fine heft to their little pixel bodies.  You feel like you are actually steering kawaii lumps of tireless, monster-bashing meat, not flicking around passionless digital ghosts that would feel perfectly satisfied in either state of inertia.  This game has nailed it where too many indie platformers falter!Momodora IIIis the very model of a low-cost neoretro platformer.  Though it can be completed in under 25 minutes if you rush, you shouldn't let that concern you, as the game's potential brevity completely belies the amount of fun that can be had from it.MOMODORA FOREVER!"

I have nothing but compliments on those aspects. They put me right into the right mood and into the world they built.The gameplay is where things get a little fuzzy. Platforming is good. All the right elements are there, the character size, the camera system, speed, platforms size and distance. Everything comes together nicely and jumping around is fun and challenging.The level design (or room design?) has its highs and lows. Sometimes you enter a room and a couple of steps ahead there's a spike pit. Seeing how fast the character move this is a very easy death right there. You just entered the room and is still pressing the dpad, you fall over simply because you didn't have time to process the room layout.Minor nitpick: The first screen of the game tells you to press A to start (as in the xbox button). I am using one so that's nice. But after that is all arrow keys this, shift button that.Combat is the main problem I have. Even some ingredients that made platforming great are getting in the way of a good combat system. The character speed and size on screen, combined with the range of melee attack, forces you to get uncomfortably close to the enemies at the same time making that very hard. A wrong touch at the dpad and you are taking contact damage or too far to do any damage. Add to that a ridiculous amount of screen shake, projectiles flying around, ghost companion, and the confusion is all set. I find myself squinting at the screen the whole time to find my character and it's just not enjoyable.Honestly I'm finding it hard to get over the combat aspect of the game.

I only played for 40 minutes, and I don't know if I'll keep playing.So, reiterating: I'm not such a great fan of the game at the moment.

No more map or hidden health items, or a secret thing you have to get to get the good endingx Around halfway or 3/4 through the game I got sick of it and decided to just rush through everything to progress...and it workedx Holding S to shoot feels a lot more awkward than pressing up S, which made me rarely want to use projectiles (though perhaps this was on purpose?)x I found that most bosses could easily be beaten by just standing next to them and spamming attack while tanking any damage...and this is on the normal difficultyx It feels like I missed a lot but apparently I got 89% completion so I guess not! Though seeing the npcs again definitely would've made things less confusingx No more upgrades like double jump or dash, just items that I feel like didn't so much to mix things up when equippedx Explosions kill you in one hit! This is a bit hard to get used to when they are normal attacks for some enemiesx Money bounces obnoxiously and falls through platforms, making it difficult to get all of it unless you waste an item slot on the money magnetx The last boss felt pretty anticlimactic, I only figured they must be the last one while I was fighting them because they had multiple formsx Reaaaaaaaally bad framerate drops for little reason.

The game is very easy to pick up, even giving you a mode where you are invincible. The easy mode is tougher but still should give everyone a pleasant time. Hard mode is  20 steps up the difficulty ladder, making the game quite a challenge and testing your skills, your knowledge about the few enemies, the worlds and the various items you find or buy during your journey.You can start the game as either Momo or Dora, 2 Priestesses on their way to stop evil and save their village. There sadly is not really all that much story in this game, same goes for lore. Every character in the game looks adorable and interesting and it's kind of a shame we don't get to know much about them.I really enjoyed the level design, at no point did the game feel cheap and it harmonized perfectly with the combat and those really good controls. Besides the visuals thats what i really liked the most about the game, these controls were that damn good. There are also some secrets in the game, which are nice but nothing mandatory or special.I found it sad that the game was as short as it was, it took me 1 hour finishing it, my other playthroughs took about <20 minutes or so.

Naopak jsem rád že jsem si tuto hru pořídil. I přesto, že hra samotná je velmi krátká ( Mě osobně trvalo pouhých 58 minut tuto hru dohrát. Ano, 58 minut ! ) tak je to skvělá zábava a když se ji naučíte tak i bezvadná odreagovačka. Co se týče hratelnosti tak doporučuji použít Gamepad, hra je pro něj jako strvořená. Jinak se hra ovládá naprosto hladce. Po grafické stránce sice hra není nic extra ale grafika samotná je jednoduchá a příjemná. Co se týče soundtracku hra nijak extra nevyniká ale i tak dokáže navodit tu správnou atmosféru která je adekvátní momentálnímu prostředí. Příběh ve hře je poměrně zahalen tajemstvím, sám jsem nevěděl co se přesně celou dobu děje. O postavách se toho bohužel taky moc nedozvíte. Abych to celé shrnul dohromady, hra mě moc bavila ale trochu mě zklamalo že je tak krátká. Avšak jako kompenzaci po dohrání nabízí možnost ""new game +"", ""speedrun"" a hraní za druhou postavu což hru činí o něco těžší. 8/10 bodů, skvělá ale krátká hra. Až budu mít možnost tak si jistě pořídím následovníka této hry ""Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight"".---I bought Momodora III during the Steam summer sale 2016 for 0,99€ and i certainly do not regret it. I´m actually really happy that i´ve bought this game. Despite the fact that the game itself is very short ( I personally finished it in 58 minutes. Yes, 58 minutes ! ) it is a great fun and when you learn how to play it it can be a great game to relax. When it comes to gameplay i recommend to use a Gamepad. Otherwise the controls are smooth. Graphics are nothing extra but they´re very simple and enjoyable. Soundtrack isn´t any special either but it does do the job well, it gets the right mood corresponding with the current level. The story is kind of a mystery, i personally didn´t really know what was going on half of the time. You won´t get to know much about the characters either. To summarize it all, i enjoyed the game a lot but i was sort of dissapointed by the fact that the game is so short. It does offer two different characters ( Playing as the second one is harder ) and when you finish it you can do a ""speedrun"" or play ""new game +"". 8/10 points, great but short game. I´m most probably going to buy the next game of this series ""Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight"" when i get the chance."

My friend suggested it to me, and having both beaten and enjoyed it, I can say that it was worth the price.Momodora III is an action platformer, pure and simple. No puzzles, no fetch quests, no level system: just action and platforming. The player is given two different characters to choose from, along with a wide variety of upgrades and power-ups hidden throughout. The gameplay is simple, but effective.It's the style of the game, however, that really makes Momodora worth playing. The simplistic 8-bit graphics are vibrant and well-animated, with lush, ethereal environments to explore. The music is fantastic, offering a collection of energetic synth melodies at times, while giving haunting chords others.The story is scarcely given, but it does exist. It's the blending of it all that creats the experience, not any one facet. And clocking in at about 50 minutes, the game is short and sweet. Go buy it."

It still has a lot of soul and extremely cute pixel art, and there are some cool secrets to find. It could use a little more content, though. If this game spent a tad bit longer in development it would've been a gem but as it stands its pretty much comparable to Momodora 2, just with a lot more polish.The combat is fun with the different items that augment your character, the music is great and not as chiptune-y as you'd expect, and the boss fights are interesting (although somewhat derived from other games, I'm lookin' at you Prismriv-I mean Arabella Sisters). This game is extremely fun to speedrun, and it is fairly replayable because you are bound to miss many of the secrets and hidden items. There are also two characters. I played with the hard character because the easy one was a little bit too powerful in comparison. I didn't wanna cheese the bosses at all.Also, to the devs: the Arabella Sisters fight has problems when you take out the white one first. You can be completely barred by projectiles due to their random patterns when they come out, and then you get hit by the purple beam attack because you can't jump over the huge wall of purple bullets. That's pretty cruel.Once I noticed this, I just killed the purple one first because the white one is seriously a pushover in her second phase, and so is the purple one in her first phase. This is kinda imbalanced. And yes, I know that you can redirect the bullets by jumping. That sometimes isn't enough. Unless I'm missing something (I never tried to attack the bullets to cancel them, so maybe I'm just stupid for not doing that), I see it as a problem.Other than that, I give it a momo/10Also, HellkiteDrake made some music for this game."

The soundtrack is fantastic, but it unfortunately doesn't appear to be available for download anywhere. Difficulty and level design are, for the most part, very well considered. There's enough optional collectables that power up your character in different ways that you can tailor the difficulty to whatever degree you prefer. The game can be Dante Must Die-hard or Kirby-easy; it's all up to you. Level design is very Clasicvania-esque in that it expects you to take things somewhat slowly and to carefully consider your approach to navigating obstacles and fighting the common enemies. Boss fights are fun and well designed, but have a little too much health for how simple their attack patterns are. Though, as mentioned above, there's an item you can abuse to make boss fights ridiculously easy. Replay value is going to stem entirely from how much you enjoyed the game. It offers a New Game+ where you keep your items, but as far as I could tell nothing really changes between the playthroughs (though feel free to tell me I'm wrong). But that's okay. It's short and fun enough that I can definitely see myself busting out Momodora III on a rainy day. It doesn't offer any real incentives for a replay, but neither did any of the classic titles it's clearly inspired by.If you're a fan of classic Mega Man, Castlevania, or Cave Story then consider picking this up.

It's one of the shortest games in my entire library; I certainly missed a number of things, but it was completed in around 35 minutes.  The price is fine, especially on sale, but I think the sequel is going to have more lasting appeal.There's a couple cool features here (something about how the shopkeepers stock items- be it based on how quick you are, or randomly decided) and there's a general competence in the game, but Momodora III is probably not the kind of game that will stick with you over the years.  Small but detailed pixel art, simple combat and bosses, equippable items and quick platforming are all endearing; it's a stepping stone for the developer as much as it is for a player.  There's nothing wrong with that, but there's many other titles to choose from on steam- with more ambitious scope.If you want a breezy afternoon game you can knock out in less than an hour (or speedrun), this won't disappoint you.

It has respawning enemies to fight so it's got some Call of Duty in it. There's a charge attack in it so it's got some Megaman in it. There's some girls in it so it's inspired by Touhou. You can fight bosses so there's some MGS in there. The enemies are sometimes anthropomorphic onions, so a bit of Parappa the Rapper. You kneel over at checkpoints that you can warp around to, a feature directly ported from Dark Souls 2. This game's difficulty is taken from the classic platformer Microman. You can equip items to your character just like in Skyrim. There's blocks that fall down, just like Tetris.In fact, I would find it hard to not compare things in this game to other games.

There are secret items you can find (and if you can't find them, you can buy them later from a shopkeeper) and achievements to unlock.My only real complaint about this game is the cost-to-playtime ratio, this game will last about an hour on a first playthrough for a player who likes to take their time. Even with that, you still get more playtime for your money than with most AAA releases nowadays, so it evens out.I actually think my favorite part of this game was the music, which is calm and soothing throughout, with each piece complementing the environment.(Beat the game on Hard difficulty in 90 minutes, getting the good ending)"

Even then there are some parts where the platforming has to be so precise it's more frustrating than anything else (e.g. thin platforms with spike pits on either side, so if you don't land perfectly, you die instantly).The few bosses I faced were surprisingly easy.

I don't remember any of the bosses either now, actually.

Where as in Dark Souls when the player messes up it is entirely the player's fault, this game has you dying from otherwise easy situations.1. The lack of any sort of invincibility frames after you get hit means that you can go from full health to dead because you got stuck inside an enemy.2. Your main attack's range is shorter than the sprite shows so this leads to you having to get really closer to enemies than you need to.3. The physics are slippery in that it's hard to position yourself outside of the enemy's range but still inside yours without getting hit.4. Lastly, you can not rebind the keys unless you use a gamepad.

I played Momodora II (freeware) and loved it very much so. Momodora II was a very fun and cute Metroidvania that was short and had some fun bosses. It wasn't an amazing thing like Bunny Must Die is, but it was worth my time. So anyways, Momodora III.I bought it. The first thing I noticed that the start level was a straight shoot with nothing interesting about it. Then the rest of the game was the same thing. No more exploring. This means that it just ends up being simple level design with basic enemies in them. In terms of movement, there is no double jump in this game. There is also no real mobility skills. This means as a platform it is massively lacking. As the levels are much more linear as well, there is nothing to really explore. The backgrounds look nice enough, but it is just basic level design.This brings it up to the combat. Easy mode character is stupid easy, with the ability to tank enemies without a care. Hard mode character does need to be more careful. However, for both of them, due to the very simplist nature of how you attack in this game with the lack of fun movement, it is boring. The boss fights tend to have all of three moves each. Basic enemies will have one to two. I know the Momodora II had the same issue, but it felt longer than this and the map itself did bring some exploration.This review is a bit over the place, but the core thing is this. Play Momodora II. Nothing added was of value, and the things that did change got worse. Don't buy itttttttttt!"

The combat feels really uninvolved, with it actively trying to get you to not fight things with awkward placement and lack of a proper downwards/upwards slice, no wall jumps, 'touchy' hitboxes, and once you get the hang of it, it's really easy even on hard, especially with how OP the ghost is.  For anyone looking for a good combat oriented platformer you should probably look towards other momodora games or even something like Hollow Knight."

Momodora III has two playable characters, Momo and Dora, which both have their own difficulty level. Momo is HARD mode, and Dora is EASY mode.This game is filled with merchants, and although fairly linear it does have multiple endings, and the music and graphics are great! However it is a pretty short game (I clocked in at about an hour and a half on my first run through), but after beating the game you can essentially start with a ""New Game+"", where the levels are slightly more challenging and you get to keep your items from your last run.The only attacks you get are your sword and a letter that you throw. Your attacks are upgradable though through merchants scattered through out the levels. There is also a 'summon stone' for sale, that once equipped will summon a Ghost Girl that will aid you in your quest; while she can act rather ""Tails"" like at times, wandering off cliffs frequently, she is very useful for fighting bosses and the Mario style ghosts which stop and go invisible when you're looking their way.The main challenge of the game is learning the basic patterns of the enemies, and avoid falling objects while jumping over spikes. Your standard retro platformer fare.And As far as the story goes, there isn't much to it, and for the most part it is mostly inferred through sparse brief dialogues with NPCs, and a couple events. The story could be easily summed up in a couple sentences, honestly.I only have 2 complaints with this game. The first one is that it starts in Windowed mode (at least on my machine.) Adventurously I remedied this for myself by seeing what the F keys did - you can switch to fullscreen mode by pressing F4; however it would have been nice if the game had a menu option that either told you this or switched to Window modes for you.My other complaint is that once you're playing the game, you can not go back to the main start menu without exiting the game first. It's not too big of a deal, but it would be useful. Also it's a little quirky how you exit the game while playing: you must first hit escape, followed by F1.Overall, this is worthy, and highly polished successor to the first two Momodora games (which are free from the developer's website!)

It took my about an hour to complete the first time when I searching all the extra passages and side bosses, athough the second time through I beat it in 20mins (deaths not included) which is actually one of the steam achievements.  I enjoyed the pixal art and simple controls.  Your only attack are a basic slash and a charge ranged attack.  There are a few cool items to find in hidden areas like getting a ghost to fight by your side and healing when you kill stuff.  The bosses, while nothing groundbreaking, are still fun to defeat.  They each follow a specific pattern that's pretty easy to learn.  There's no real story and the characters don't do anything important (aside from the shops), but it's still a fun title.  It's a pretty basic plateformer with instant kill spikes, bouncy plateforms and such.  I'd say it might not be worth a full $5, but I would recommend picking it up on sale sometime if you want a relaxing yet violent game."

It's simple to grasp and each item feels valuable. I found myself learning how to quickly change items on the fly, giving me the best advantage in a given situation.

The controls are tight and responsive and if you die it is your fault. There is no time limit so you can take your time and slowly defeat enemies and learn the layout.The story is that Death has turned evil and Momo or Dora, being shrine maidens, must purify her. Momo or Dora must battle her minions through various stages with huge boss fights to defeat Death. The cool thing is whenever you die you will see Death laughing at Momo or Dora.Momo and Dora both have an extremely short reach with their melee weapon, but it goes into an arc. They also have a ranged attack and Momo and Dora both control the same from what I saw. The enemies are not difficult but serve as cannon fodder for money. You need money to buy items from vendors or you can find them after a boss fight or in a secret treasure chest.The game does not support two players, the boss fights are simple when you learn their patterns and the game is linear, too linear. Once you know the layout you can zoom through the game in under 30 minutes.  I also wish that Momo and Dora had different colored weapons and a different ranged shot. All these can be overlooked and still be enjoyed.To sum it all up, I whole heartedly recommend this game to people who are looking for a new experience or just want to test out their platforming skills.

The third game was the first to be sold commercially, and very much deserves it.Graphically, it continues the progression from Momodora to Momodora 2, with more detailed backgrounds and larger enemies. The gameplay, too, follows on the previous title's advancements. This time you can choose between Momo and Dora, the protagonists of the first two entries, with Dora’s quest serving as the game’s hard mode. With either one, you collect items that allow you to use different powers against an array of monsters and bosses.The level structure is something of a compromise between that of the first and second Momodora games. You have discrete levels, but can teleport back and forth between them at any save point. At the end of each, a boss awaits. Not only are these powerful enemies more frequent than in prior entries, they have much more interesting patterns and better hit detection. They're more fair, and much more fun.While it lasts, this is a top-tier game, but it's extremely short. Though no platforming master, I was able to beat the easier scenario in under three hours. Still, that was under three hours of excellent action-platforming and some enjoyable light exploration, offered at a very reasonable price."

Granted, don't go in expecting the breadth and depth of gameplay and challenge that something like Cave Story offers. This is a short but sweet platforming experience that will net you a handful of playthroughs if you follow the typical pattern of doing a blind playthrough, one masochistic hard run and then focusing on getting the reasonable achievements.The graphics are pleasant and nostalgic, the soundtrack is particularly fantastic and the gameplay is tight and satisfying.In terms of the story these are the games that appeal to me the most, ones that don't shove the entire plot into the players face from the get go and instead leave the player initially clueless, requiring them to explore, speak to NPC's that offer snippets of information in a natural way, read item descriptions, etc. Truthfully there is very little substance here storywise, which is expected from a game this short, but it leaves plenty of room for the player to draw their own conclusions and just generally muse on the characters and the state of the world, which helps fill the time while you're flying through the levels mercilessly slaughtering anything that isn't a friendly NPC with your leaf.My one caveat is while the boss fights are varied in both the designs and attack patterns, it's simply too easy to stand next to them and continuously wail on them until they die. Certainly this becomes more difficult on hard due to having less health or by not using certain items but it's still feasible. Granted some of the bosses move regularly and in a way that mitigates this but they could have all used an extra attack that heavily punishes standing still and continuously spamming. The addition of a flying boss that forced the player to fully utilize their ranged attack with small windows of opportunity for melee damage would have been beneficial in the sense of adding some diversity and increasing the value of certain items for at least one boss fight. Regardless, all the boss fights were reasonably enjoyable.All in all if you are a fan of platformers, you'll enjoy this and for the price there is really no excuse for not trying it. I'm certainly looking forward to seeing what the sequel has to offer."

Being on a platformer vibe on that time, having just finished Cave Story, I enjoyed those two very much. That just build up the expectation for the other two. Now, having playing III, as others I can't say I enjoyed the change of gameplay of an metroidvania like to something more linear. The gameplay does feel a little bit ""soulless"", but I enjoyed it anyway, and would recommend it as it has a fair price. Off topic, but I already played a little of RUtM and I simply fell in love with it in the first few minutes.The art and soundtrack are amazing as always, I don't even have to remark that. And thanks for the ""casual"" mode, my cousin came here yesterday and he is quite unused to platformer, so that difficult helped a lot.Oh, the only ""down"" to the whole Momodora series (not really important to the gameplay, much a personal matter): the lore and general idea of the games are very interesting, but receives little to no attention on the games. It feels more like an ""excuse"" for a good game, like an action movie, than really something that matters. But different from a Jason Statham movie, the ideas worked on here are sweet and could really get somewhere if done right. I hope RUtM did more on that way."

It's short, but some variable story events, challenge achievements and a New Game Plus mode add replayability.An equipment system lets you customize your abilities and allows for some fun combinations.There's a weird design choice that takes getting used to, but works out somehow: Your own attacks are drawn on top of everything else, so reckless rapid-fire attacking is prevented by the need to keep your screen clear.Enemies aren't hard to dodge, but getting hit is really punishing. In hard mode, you die in 2 hits. You have to play carefully and strategically. The level design means you have to stay on your toes and can't cheese everything, even when you've unlocked some powerful item combos - with the exception of the 5x damage item, which serves as an easy mode for boss fights and can be avoided to preserve the challenge.Momodora 3 brings nothing spectacularly new, but it delivers a memorable good time for very cheap.

It is the third game in the Momodora series, but you do not have to play the other Momodora games first. I recommend you buy Momodora Reverie Under the Moonlight instead of this game if you haven't played it. Reverie under the Moonlight is the fourth game in the series, but it's a prequel and doesn't require you to have played the others. If you've already played Momo IV (or it doesn't interest you), then I recommend you play the first two Momodora games first. They're free; play them first! Now onto actually talking about Momodora III.Momodora III's combat system is a lot like the system in Momodora II. The combat system mainly consists of melee attacks. Enemies also drop money which you can use to buy items to improves your character. The 'ceremonial fabric' item is incredibly overpowered, especially in hard mode, so don't use it because it will ruin the experience. The combat feels much better than in Momo II. The gameplay is fun, and the bosses are cool. It's a little easy at times, but I definitely still found it enjoyable. The game's graphics are very nice and colorful. The music is good too. My biggest complaint is the game's story. It features some NPCs I liked, but there's no real point where the story is explained to the player. Towards the beginning, you meet a girl named Mariel; she is the only way the story is explained in the game. You should know this so you don't spend 1/2 the game waiting for a proper exposition. The steam page does a better job at telling you the story than the actual game. There is an online manual(http://www.rdein.puyovs.net/manual.html). If you go there, you can read the story and about the characters; I recommend you read it before you play. Momodora III was pretty short and didn't feel like it had a real beginning, middle, or end. The game is linear (like Momo 1 but unlike 2 and 4). There are lots of secrets, and getting all the achievements is fun and not too hard. I recommend it if you've played 1 and 2 and enjoyed 2. Personally, It's worse than 2, but it's still fun and improves on a lot of things which weren't the greatest in 2. Momodora III is also extremely cheap!"

This one expands on that game play greatly and is really fluid in the animation department. I love the simple but well done graphics. The music is also quite nice. The controls can be a bit floaty, but still workable. This one has me excited to purchase the next in the series. My only complaint is the story is lacking...it's kinda just there.I think if you enjoyed Cave Story or Shantae...then you will like this one."

The artwork is charming, and the music is well-crafted.My complaints are that it's a bit too easy for my tastes, and it's very short. The bosses were very simple for the type of game that it is - I killed the last boss in 2 attempts (1st death to cheese mechanic). Any powerups that customized your character's abilities were cool, but they were scarce. I wish there were more of those.If you have an hour to burn, and you like the games listed above, I'd say you don't have much to lose for $2. However, don't expect much more than 1 playthrough."

Momodora 1 & 2 are free games that exist outside of Steam, so try playing those first before trying this one out, unless you don't care to blow $2. The 4th game: Reverie Under the Moonlight, is a much higher quality title: better visuals, longer game, deeper combat, all that good stuff. Momodora 3 is a fine game, just expect to get what you pay for.This game does have NG+, so replayability for steam achievements is there if you're into that sort of thing."

It was mapped to X or Y, Tho i changed it to a shoulder button, so i could change them in battle,easilly, Dont get me wrong, i only did this in the final boss, and even then, it was probably still kinda unnecesary, and pretty much nothing else, Im not saying its bad, Simple can be fun, and if it still is refreshing, it pushes the industry further, tho i will talk more on that later.Pros:-The combat against normal enemies is fun, and if you really have good control over your characters movement, you can pass them and just run, and take very few hits.-You can pick from two characters: I mean, they dont change at all in gameplay, but its nice.-Multiple difficulty settings: You have Casual, which, really? for seeing the story? there isnt much story, and its not like the game is that hard in Easy, that i would call normal, Start here, And hard, that i would call madness, you take TWICE the damage, and have 3/5 of your health in easy, The first boss kills you in 2 hits.-New game+: When you get certain ending, you can play new game+, Is cool, you keep items from previous play, (Except for the keys) and have another item slot, that, ill say its pretty unnecessary.-Beautifull pixel art, and soundtrack-The bosses are GREAT, but...Cons:-The bosses are fun until you get the pattern, the dont telegraph their attacks, they just repeat the 2 or 3 attack they have eeevery time, The final boss is an exception, beacuse it has various phases, but overall meh.-Some of the achievements feel stupid, they arent necessarly bad, but feelm i wont talk much beacuse i dont have a food answer, just how i feel.-The game is kinda short, i mean, I love short games, mainly beacuse i abandon the long ones, Not beacuse i dont have time, its just that if feel burned out, But even then it felt short, I wanted more.-A few enemy and trap placement kill you in one thing, and that is kinda dickish.Overall i really liked the game, and even if it isnt that original, its great for 2 dollars, The two first Momodoras are free on the web, and im aiming for triying them, and im also aming for the sequel, Reverie Under The Moonlight, Probably going to use some christmas money on it and other titles i wanna play.EDIT: One of the tags is anime, And apart from the artwork... what why how who, the game is cute, not anime, or atleast thats my opinion."

Though I was confused at most of the storyline and frustrated by pits and spikes, nevertheless it was a good game for the most part. I enjoyed the casual setting for gameplay as I wanted to play the game without frustrations during boss battles. If you like games like Mega Man or Castlevania, then this is a game for you.It had a few features missing from a classic Metroidvania:I didn't like that I could only equip ""one"" item to improve my abilities. I mostly used the clone helper for the most part of the game. I also didn't like that there was no backtracking and there weren't that many hidden areas. There wasn't much exploring as they have you go in one direction (by this I don't mean left or right but I mean there's one door and you go through it to the next area. I wasn't given options)I've heard there was a different ending and I might replay this for that ending in the future! :) Great game overall. Looking forward to the next Momodora.PS: Wondering what happened to Momodora I & II as I would definitely buy and play them."

Gorgeous art and music, and the gameplay, much like older 2D games, never gets too overly complicated.Just know going in that you can finish this game in one hour, maybe two if you REALLY take your time, and can probably get every achievement in less than four hours.  But I wouldn't say that's a bad thing.  Many of the best games out there can be beaten in such a short time, and most of them cost more than this (and a good number of them probably aren't nearly as fun).Oh and unless you're specifically speedrunning or achievement hunting or what have you, play on Hard.

The gameplay was fine but more of the same and I found a way to break it without really trying. So I just played on hard cause there wasn’t a normal mode. I got the items that increases damage when you have low health, make your charge attack longer, and add poison to your charge attack to kill every boss within seconds pretty much. Sound and Music is nothing special. The visuals are really good though, everything is really pretty to look at. It’s a quick game but there’s tons of secrets I guess, I didn’t find any I don’t think but I would want to go back and play it again to find them while trying a new playstyle, so replayability is good. The story is the same as the last two and is dull by now, except it has some odd ending that didn’t make sense but I think there’s multiple endings so whatever. It was fun and good and worth your time, only about an hour."
