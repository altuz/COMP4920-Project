,Not Recommended,302830,30180873,Posted: 25 February,all,Wrex3,After playing this for a bit i ran into plenty of pay to win people. This is completly unfair that all armor and actual nice guns are locked by pay to win. I have seen my team get wiped in front of me in a matter of seconds by some pay to win guy with 10 shot armor and a one shot lmg. It would need quite some balancing like acuallty being able to get the guns and armor. At the moment the game is very fustrating and i would not play it if you do not plan on spending money on a free to play game.

76561198147030076,Not Recommended,302830,30103694,Posted: 22 February,all,Anarchy,"My previous review of this game went rather in-depth on all the things that are wrong with it:- Needing an absurd number of points to win a round- Winning a round not giving any rewards, experience, or incentive to do so- Random enemies being immune to all damage from you in tanks mode (Tanks removed as of now)- Sections of floor in maps becoming corrupted and glitching you through it, killing you- Zombies having 5000 HP while you have 100 in survival mode- Player levels going well past 75 but the last free gun you get is at around 13- Having to pay for over 90% of the weaponry that exists- Having sniper rufles that one-shot you even with armor that you had to pay forBut all of this, I have been able to overlook and still enjoy the game for over a year. Even with the minimal effort the devs have actually put into this game since sticking it on steam as an unapologetic cash grab, it was still pretty fun if you had good guns and/or a good aim.This is no longer the case.For months, now, the game has been plagued by more hackers than I've ever seen in all the time I've played it. Around october of last year, the devs supposedly rolled out an anti-cheat system that's, according to them, resulted in the banning of thousands of hackers to date. But if anything, they've managed to increase the hacker count. It's impossible to go an entire round without at least one person joining with auto-aim or full out insta-kill.At this point the message has been made clear by PiotrK, who is usually credited with the origin of the latest hack being used, and the inattentive devs who have abandoned the people of their game and given them no way to defend themselves, that Blockade should be put to rest. I hope for the sake of everyone who might come across this game in the hopes of finding an enjoyable FPS that one of two things happens:Either let this game die, take it off of steam, and roll around in the profit you made while letting the playerbase retain SOME level of enjoyment from this, or get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together and fix the game you made, show the people paying you for your game that you care about this at ALL.Don't play this. It was fun once, but it hasn't been for a long time."

The game is really simple, you pick your guns, you spawn in then you kill stuff for levels and try and capture a point. and thats it. Or tanks, which is basically the same thing, only with tanks. The game is fun, but the problem lies with the Pay to Win feel to it, as helmets make the game infinately harder, and the fact that people can have much better weaponry than you with lower levels is fustrating. The game is not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but its very very annoying sometimes. I reccommend playing it in bursts, or have a friend of yours install the game and constantly kill him for levels so you dont have to pay to play."

This may appeal to the average 10 year old gamer, the kind of guy that doesn't know much about games and can't afford a game such as minecraft. Now to be brutally honest, for the average steam user and avid game enthusiast, this game would be considered a no-go. For what it is, this being a poorly made fps in an almost identical style to the popular game mincraft, some may say it ""Does the job"". As i was mentioning about an average game enthusiast, this just will not be what you are looking for. Weather it is the poor texture quality, moderate to average game modes, poor user interface and so on, the game is not great. Playing the game just feels clunky and not very smooth. Playing a well made game and then suddenly jumping to this, i can say the difference is evident. When you play a good game made by well known developers and play this, it feels quite horrific. The only time i can imagine playing this would be  of pure irony and not for the pleasure/enjoyment of the game. I can honestly say that i feel sympathy for those that play this game unironically. To sign off, i would say this game is 2/10. 2 being the fact that i can laugh about it with friends. The game is bad."

At one point I would have recomended this game to some friends, it was a fun little shooter, with a little pay to win but not so much that you stood no chance against those who do shell out money. But then, guns that you had no way to compete with were added. And body armor+ and helmet+, just stuff that was way more powerful that anyone who wanted to play free would ever get and would have to play against in almost every game. And the servers... if you manage to connect to one of the servers that isn't dead (most are), you have to deal with HUGE amounts of lag. So, pretty much, Lag + Pay to Win = not fun anymore."

If you die arbitrarily in a game you need to understand what you did wrong and/or what you need to do better. If you just plop over dead and you never understand why... gg - lasted all of 5 min on my pc

HOW A F*CKING SH*TTY WEAPON CAN F*CKING COSTS 50 CENTS. It's very expensive for a game like this. I'm thinking you need to low the prices a 50% or 40% This game is good but man. If you dont have any money YOU CAN'T HAVE FUN. Please guys, Low the prices and hurry whit the updates please. At least 1 year waiting. The majority of weapons are of 1 pixel thick! And when you put two blocks. and you break the one below THE F*CKING OTHER BLOCK F*CKING DISAPPEAR! I wan't more physics please."
