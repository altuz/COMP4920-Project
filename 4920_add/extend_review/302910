,Not Recommended,302910,11557227,"Posted: 4 August, 2014",all,Gunther,"I cannot stress enough how much you should avoid this game. $5.00 is about $10.00 more than this game is worth. I will admit I got a few entertaining starts from the ridiculous jump scares (they are frequent, loud and awkward), but I did not enjoy this title. Allow me to elaborate:ConsDarkness- It is ridiculously dark at all times in the game. The light sources are laughable. While darkness is used in horror to stimulate the player and create a claustrophobic feeling, darkness is used inThe Houseto annoy you. It makes the game practically unplayable. If you are willful enough to play through it despite the darkness, you will find the most difficult obstacle is simply navigating the map. I only completed the game using a hedge-maze philosophy to walk through the house because you can only see the walls or floor if you are huddled close to them.Story (or lack of it)- Probably the weakest of my points because story isn't necessarily the driving factor in a horror game, but the attempted story of this game is very poor. It explains nothing major about who you are, why you are fighting the house, and most importantly why the player should care. Next to the ""scares"" it means virtually nothing. I am okay with a horror game lacking a story, but I am not okay with a story lacking a point.Honest Opinion- I love indie horror games, they are marvelous. Even when they are terrible, I can usually take something away from them because the developer(s) put so much of their heart and soul into it that it shows-or at least they were able to make a memorable experience through their efforts. This game has great potential, and could have been executed so amazingly well, but seems to have at some point fallen short. A low price tag does not make up for that. Maybe the developers are planning on revamping the game at some point, but for now they are profiting off anyone willing to buy their work that they either did not finish, or that they put up for sale when it wasn't the best they could make it.ProsIt's Cheap- You do get what you pay for with this title. I can honestly say I didn't give them a penny more than necessary. Cheap doesn't mean a game can be bad, though. It needs to at least try.Jump Scare Fest- I am not the biggest fan of jump scares-I prefer to have games scare me in a way that keeps the night light on-but there are plenty of them in this game. It can make for some good moments and fun in groups. Alas, they are frequent and non-cannon which will leave you growing tired of them eventually.Unique- The house you visit stays roughly the same in design but experiences other changes as you play. You can tell a lot of work went into designing its stages-much of which goes unnoticed because of how dark it is, but I digress. If the game had gone a different direction, this would be a wonderful feature, but it is still nifty as it is.In The EndI am not hard to please. I try to find good in everything I play. That is especially so with games I purchase. However, this game has very little positives in my experience. I beat the entire game and it felt like a chore. If I hadn't started it for aYouTube Let's Play SeriesI would have never finished it. I cannot recommend this game. Thank you."
,Not Recommended,302910,11017748,"Posted: 2 July, 2014",all,† Løøh †,"The screenshots and trailers made this game look pretty cool, like something similar to Amnesia The Dark Descent. When I saw the price, I had my doubts on its quality, and those doubts ended up being correct.First of all, the opening screen (eg when you press ""New Game"") is bugged if you have a higher resolution than 1024x768. Text disappears off the side into two black boxes. Then when the game finally started I couldn't do anything; I had to alt-tab out of the window and click back into the game for it to work properly. There are no transitions from the title menu to the game, nor from one level to another; so when the game swapped levels I thought for a minute the game had crashed. Transitions are so so so important.The controls are not clearly explained; it took me a minute or two to realize that I had to equip my lighter before I could start using it, since I was under the assumption it would be assigned a key like ""F"". Even when you pull the lighter out from your inventory you still have to click a few times for it to ""light"". I found that to be particularly annoying. It also looks like you should be able to light up things like the lamps on the walls and the fireplace, but I've tried pressing all the controls while my lighter was out and nothing seems to work. If I'm not supposed to use my lighter on them, why does text pop up in front of them?The game is also nonprogressible after your lighter runs out of oil if you can't find more of it. I don't know if you're supposed to find oil, but I couldn't find any from the start of the game and within five minutes I was unable to see anything. In real life, even when the lights are out in a house, your eyes will adjust to the darkness at least a little bit, so that you can make out shapes. It shouldn't be pitch black.As for the scare factor, it definitely has an atmosphere, I'll give it that. The three jumpscares I ran into were kind of cheesy but they did startle me a little bit. But it was ruined by my frustration with the game mechanics and inability to see anything after my lighter ran out.If you are looking for a good, short, horror game, this is not it. I would not recommend this game to anyone unless the developers address some of these issues first. It seems to me that it was really rushed and could've used a month's more worth of tuning up."

Of course some of your light sources barely ""light"" anything at all...*No clear direction on what you're supposed to do (Wouldn't even be that much of a problem if you could at least SEE!)*The ""scares"" are just .jpeg's and models that just pop out in front of you and make a loud noise. It gets annoying after a while.*No story at all. You're just a guy who goes into a house. You have a car, but no flashlight! What sense does that make?!I wanted to give this game the benefit of the doubt at first. I really did. But I couldn't even play past the first 15 minutes. This game shouldn't have been greenlighted yet. There is a TON of work that needs to be done on it."

Darkness is only scary if used correctly that doesnt mean make the whole damn game dark!Way too overpriced for what it actually delivers, I've seen cheaper games then this that are better for a good horror scare.Jumpscares were many and also they were all garbage. Imagine a rpgmaker horror game jumpscare you know whaere a image pops up. expand that to a 3d game (still keeping the 2d image) and there you go.Devs clearly dont care about the community! I've seen many gamers complain about bugs and get the same automated response. So the public greenlit them just to be ripped off!So that's my review.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.If you want good games that deliver real scares there are probably tons of free indies better than this trash.Avoid at all cost or you will be added to the long list of annoyed customers."

It looks pretty straight forward but, unless I did it wrong, the game does not work. Graphic and atmosphere is good but the game play itself is garbage. For example the match only lits up and goes off like 1-3 secs..a lighter with 35% capacity I assumed only lasts 5 secs??? and you start out with no lights only a lighter that use up in 5 secs and I can't lit anything to give light and you cannot play if there is no light. The button function does not work only basic ones like w a s d movements, left mouse button, dont know what right mouse button does it just use it to discard. If this is only alpha stage hope they fix it all these problems or this game is broken and I just got scammed 5 bucks...ridiculous.."
,Not Recommended,302910,11025695,"Posted: 2 July, 2014",all,SereneSara,I went in with an open mind. The opening sequence didn't explain anything and the words were pushed off the side of the screen so I only saw TH but I didn't mind that so much. I thought it was interesting ang I liked that there were multiple light sources but they use up way too fast and barely light more than two inches in front of you. The thing that made me give this a thumbs down though were the scares. They are just flat pictures that float in the air and sometimes just stick there. Flat floating pictures of green faces aren't good.
,Not Recommended,302910,14814648,"Posted: 9 March, 2015",all,Uncle Sparticus,"This game is probably the only game in my steam library that is literally unplayable. There is no way to progress in this game at all. When you run out of matches, candles, and light sources, which if you have even a cursory interest in exploring the levels you will, and very fast, the game is effectively over.Your options are to either memorize where the candles/matches/lamps are, or stumble around watching an entirely black screen. There is no way to see in this game without a light source, at all, so running out of light is effectively the end of the game. Turning up the brightness on your monitor does nothing, as the game's darkness is just a flat black screen with no detail whatsoever for the brightness to accentuate.The game's titular house is HUGE, so even if you do find all the light sources through sheer trial and error and memorization, you will be forced to backtrack through areas without any new light sources and will, guaranteed, run out of light and the game will be essentially over.I have yet to get to a part with any combat, though the screenshots make it seem like there is some. I wouldn't know, I've only made it half an hour in before I simply could not find a single other light source in the whole house. And again, the game is absolutely 100% over once you run out of light, as you can see absolutely nothing but what might as well be a flat black .jpg in front of your screen.Light sources drain at around a percentage point a second, and the light pickups you find will never give you more than a handful of percentage points of increase anyways. Lighting the ambient stationary lamps, sort of like what Amnesia has with tinderboxes, is glitched and broken. Even though the lamps do turn on, they don't actually cast any light on anything, making them totally useless for actually being able to see and get around.The opening cutscene is a laggy mess with typos galore, you can't re-bind key settings, there's no story from what I can tell, and the jump-scares may well be horrifying, but you'll never find out, as you'll never be able to see them.This game is, no exaggeration, a black screen simulator. Don't buy this, don't even buy this as a gift. For that get Bad Rats, Desert Gunner, if you can find it Air Control. Those are bad in a funny way. This isn't funny, it isn't even a mess, it's simply rendered impossible by the developer forgetting that not everyone that plays the game is him, and as such won't be able to make a beeline for every single light source.This game needs some manner of night vision, or at least some way to make out small details in the dark, or simply making your light sources dim once you run out of light. But it doesn't, and it probably won't, so as such, it's unplayable garbage and a total waste of what little money it costs."

It's basically a collection of jump-scares while you're sent on a linear mission through a house. The big scary thing here, is that you have no permanent source of light. This gets old really quick, as you find yourself unable to feel walls, and thus navigating in darkness is totally impossible.This game might have worked in 3rd person, with some voice-acting from the protagonists side explaning what was going on, and on a console where the controller vibrates when you walk into something, and maybe a ""lock unto wall"" mode, allowing you to follow a wall while walking next to it.But seriously... If you like jump-scares, just watcha screamer movie."

If I can't see anything,at all, I'm not going to play.

They aren't even good jumpscares. Some of them are just poorly doctored photos from free stock images. Very little effort was put in to make them look creepy.The lighting makes it completely impossible to see, which I suppose was the intention. This wouldn't be too much of an issue if it weren't for the fact that most light sources are inadequate when they aren't just being weird.

The game isn't just about walking around a dark house and finding items and cheap scares along the way. It is only just that for the first part of the game, but once you progress far enough that enemies start appearing, which can kill you, then the scare factor and lack of lighting really plays a integral role in the survival horror aspect of this game.

Obviously it isn't spectacular but it's okay. Sound effects weren't always great but it was enough to scare me.You explore a haunted house which is completely dark. You rely on light sources such matches, candles and a lighter to see where you are going which are all in limited supply. You find more along the way but if you allow them run out you would be left in complete darkness. Heres a tip when you first find yourself in the dark press I to equip your lighter; it makes you figure this out yourself. Most of my time was spent traversing different levels of the house finding one key, unlocking a door to find another key and so on. Eventually I encountered a ghost...As you go the game flashes scary images at you to give you a fright. Yes this was enough to shock me repeatedly. Once I got far enough a new sound started playing and it made me feel very afraid to the point where I didn't want to go on anymore. Turns out the first hostile entity had spawned...Anyway aside from me being chicken♥♥♥♥♥♥and quiting. There were a few problems with the game. The main one for me was the cursor. I run with two screens. The game was displayed on the left one. However the cursor would repeatedly go into my second screen and if i clicked it would minimize the game. If you have multiple screens you might want to set your display settings to only use a single screen while you play this game. Also the English translations are a bit crude however probably not bad enough to be game breaking. Lastly I'm not sure if this was a bug or how it's meant to be. But I had what I thought was the correct item for a certain situation (a handcrank) but I was unable to select it in my inventory to use.Anyway the game did what it's supposed to do for me; it scared me.

I just feel like with a few things it could be a fun-bad game. The lamps on the wall only illuminate the immediate 3 inches around it. I felt like after somehow scurrying downstairs to get the gas running again I would at least be rewarded with some minimal lighting. if that were the case then the lack of sustainable light on the go could be slightly forgiven. The game has so many weird bad things about it that are very basic, like collision and textures and the like, but it's biggest offense is that you can't see. If you're not capable of giving it the creepy eyes-adjusting-to-the-dark thing then at least let the lamps slightly illuminate the whole room they're in. Basically, running around a messed up house in the dark is fun even if it's dumb, but doing it blindfolded is not, which is what this game quickly devolves into.I seriously doubt this, or any other issue will be reolved in a satisfactory manner, but still this game perplexes me. i don't understand how it came to be.but for most people, i.e. people looking for a fun and entertaining experience, this is not the game you are looking for."

Not enough explanations.The concept of the matches/light etc. is the only good thing, but it becomes very quickly frustrating because it does not last long anough, even if it has been updated to last longer.Not worth $5 at all. Avoid it unless it goes on a $1 sale. In fact no, this game should be free, because I've seen better free horror games where I would have given money to play (Cry of Fear, Afraid of Monsters, Grey...).Just ignore it unless you grab it for free."

The jumpscare images need to be better blended. The backstory for this game is nearly nonexistant. Play this game in a dark area and definetly use headphones."
