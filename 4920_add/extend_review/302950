76561198056807270,Not Recommended,302950,12412064,"Posted: 8 October, 2014",all,Sammah,"I really wanted to be able to recommend this game due to its mixed reviews.Heileen falls short of other romance based Visual Novels.  It does not really have a large amount of character development, and none of those sweet sentimental touching moments, that I have come to love from games of this genre.On my first play though, I barely spoke to the person I ended up with, and my character showed no really inkling that she liked him, nor did he to her.  In fact, he seemed like an awful person the entire time, and my character seemed to despise him.I played through to get all three endings, and each relationship seems equally forced.In other Visual Novels I have played, the protagonist gets closer to the person you wish to romance, and you learn more about them and you see a relationship forming.  This just did not happen.There also seems to be a huge anti-male sentiment within the game.  The male characters are arrogant, sexist, womanizers and violent.  The result of this is that 2 out of 3 game endings involve the protagonist concluding that she hates men.If you really enjoy Visual Novels, and you have run out of games to play, you may enjoy this game.  However, do not buy it at full price."

While on board the ship, Heileen will get to meet and interact with John, Marie, Lora, Otto and other minor characters. Achievements involve reaching a special romance ending with John, a sailor working on the ship, Heileen's childhood best friend Marie or with Heileen's aunt Lora. The game has plenty of save slots to enable quicker replays to reach a different romance ending, a tell-all relationship meter with any of the three main characters that goes up or down depending on your dialogue or option choices and the option to skip and fast-forward already read sections.Soundtracks and overall game presentation are decent. Recommended when at sale or in a bundle offer as all endings can be reached and game can be completed in less than 10 hours."
,Not Recommended,302950,20310317,"Posted: 4 January, 2016",all,✩ Helenα ✩,"This is the first Heileen game I’ve ever played, meaning I have no references about the other two games.If you want a quick experience with this early Winter Wolves game, I guess it’s worth a try (but only on sale — ain’t worth paying the full price to be totally honest). The story is dull, predictable; the main character, at least on this first game, feels empty and rather annoying since it seems that all that matters to her are how good looking some people are. I found that simply atrocious, especially on a particular scene involving her friend Marie…The art is okay. Some of the backgrounds are good, others are just bad. The background music is kinda weird: it plays sometimes, REALLY LOUD, scaring the f*ck out of me. Most of times there are some sad scenes and the songs are just all… happy. Makes no sense.Another thing that annoys me on this game is the lack of expressions: Heileen always has a) her dumb face on or b) her dumb embarrassed face on. Same with all the other characters. And speaking of them… Just awful. John makes me so mad I wish I could hit his face with one of Marco’s pans.I know this is an old game, but I’m being really honest. I hope the second and third games are better.4/10. I don’t recommend this game unless it’s on sale, you get it as a gift, or if you want to play this mess by yourself."

Based on the date of release and the price, I suspect this may be one of (if not the) first releases from Winter Wolves. As such, you can see a lot of... issues that they figured out as they got more experience. So while the weakest of their efforts, it is still interesting to see how far they've come.There are three paths in this game, plus 40 side quests. This is a good introduction to many of the characters in the trilogy. So, I shall recommend it for anyone interested."

I am a huge fan of visual novels and otome type games, so to see one so cheap on steam, I bought it right then and there, as i've been hearing nothing but good things about Heileen on many otome forums and blogs, I really wanted to try it, and legally at that. I've played some seriously heart wrenching vistual novels (like Clannad), but as I stated earlier, Heileen is a very fun read, but I grow a bit more bored each time I play it through trying to get different endings haha! I can tell you that I didn't realize I had put an hour into it until I stopped and looked at steam and noticed it, so it does stay interesting to some point."

It'g oing to be hit or miss. You have to like Visual Novels, and I lucked out as 17th century sailing, mysteries, pirates, and stowaways  are a total niche love of mine which this definitely fits.  The romance options are cute, the art is pretty great, and the story is decent enough, especially with the mystery quests along the way.  Explore all of it, and you'll probably enjoy it at least a little.Without spoilering, while there are some clunky parts in the writing, replaying over those pieces to try out the other options can make all the difference.  The characterization especially is one of the best parts."

,Not Recommended,302950,16439251,"Posted: 16 June, 2015",all,curseyourichards,"Whooo boy what a hot mess this game is.I actually quite like Winter Wolves as a developer and have bought a few of their games; there's a visible committment to doing better with each release and that's aces in my book, so I'll probably continue to buy from them in the future despite this negative review. That said, this is one of the company's older offerings (from 2008!), and it...shows.Where to start? Well, the writing ain't great, but it's mostly just a bit weak rather than flat outbad.The real problems come from character interactions and some less than stellar narrative choices. Depending on how your playthrough goes, and the dialogue choices you make, you may be treated to any of the following erm...not-so-great plot points and chatty bits:***SPOILERS****The main character's best friend tries to commit suicide as a means of either a.) getting attention from her love interest or b.) because she's so afraid of being without her love interest; this character is a possible romance for the player character and the suicide attempt is basically laughed off as ~oh you wacky friend, don't go doing that again now!~ errr.....(And just a thought, but maybe dating the woman with 'potential posessive stalker' written all over her isn't such a hot idea?)*The main character is the victim of an attempted sexual assult--out of three playthroughs, this happened to me twice, with two different guys.*There's some racism, which seems utterly untintentional but is still quite unfortunate. One of the possible love interests basically adopted a couple of slaves when they were children, raised them in England and is taking them back to America because she thinks they'll have a better life there, working on a plantation. In the seventeenth century. Because the plantation ownerpromisesto treat them better than theotherslaves. Um.*The main character has a few 'but I can't like women, that'll give me cooties' moments during romances with female love interests, which can be explained by this taking place in the seventeenth century, I suppose, but it was still disappointing to encounter.♥♥♥♥♥♥shaming. EVERYWHERE. Though the game tries very hard for an Aesop about not judging a book by its cover, it doesn't quite pull it off. If Lora is on screen, you can guarantee that at least half the timesomeonewill have something negative and judgmental to say about her sexual promiscuity and/or her history of sex work. If this sort of thing bothers you, this game is sooooo not for you.****END SPOILERS***On a purely personal pet-peeve note, the game isoutrageouslyanachronistic in too many ways to count. If a filmy bra-and-panties lingerie set is seventeenth century sleeping attire, I'm the Queen of Prussia's Court Jester.Is the game worth buying? As an intro to the characters and if you get it in a bundle with the others for super cheap or otherwise on deep discount and are a completionist (like me!), go for it. On its own? I'm afraid the answer is no. It's super short and as I understand, the sequels play fast and loose with the continuity presented in this one, even going so far as to retcon some of it, so you may not even be missing much.5/10"

It's all about little girls' overly dramatic fantasies about boys (and other girls); what's worse, all you can do is click on a very limited choice of replies. If you're over 13, don't bother."

It felt like the writing was all over the place - half the scenes were so random and didn't even make sense tbh. Like they were thrown in as a filler or something. And many of the characters were just plain annoying. I like other Winter Wolves games, but Heileen falls way short of their better quality games and I don't think I'll be buying either of the sequels anytime soon."

It's a mockery of a historical novel, and not even an entertaining one. The anachronisms bounce between stupid and annoying. Also weirdly racially insensitive, as somehow returning the slaves that were saved from slavery to slavery is a good thing? They'll be safer there? I ... I don't even know ...As for the romances, they're run of the mill to get the basic guy or best friend ending, and weird to get your uncle's mistress ending.If you want an entertaining visual novel with romances, try Magical Diary. If you want a story with weird yet touching romances, try Hatoful Boyfriend. There are so many better novels out there with more choice and better characters. I cannot fathom how something this bad and boring became a series."

Purchased under the misapprehension that it would be an interesting and different style of game dependent upon storytelling and choices; but its scope is much more limited than I expected and the storyline hardly worth the time. The description should give more of an impression on how sophisticated the game is, which would help gamers interested in more story-driven games more of a clue about the games on offer."

Big mistake.This game is by far one of the worst I have played. The story was just confusing and the main character (Heileen) is the most narcissistic and shallow person I have ever come across in a game.The second game is better, but still I would not recomend that either.I do own the third game, but I have yet to make myself wanna play it.I bought all three as a bundle and thankfully they where on sale, so I didn't have to pay much."

The II and III games are much better, but the first game acts as an introduction to the characters and sets the stage for the rest of the series. There is a lot of over the top melodrama, so don't take the game too seriously and you'll have fun!There are only 3 romance options and 2 of them are women, so I hesitate to reccomend it as an otome game, but if you like otome you'll probably have fun here. The relationships aren't very deep, so if you're looking for touching moments and swoon-worthy suitors this is not the game for you.It's not a terriby long game. It took me 4 play throughs to get all 3 endings (I messed up on Lora and had to play a 2nd time...)"

The storyline and dialogue were weak, characters irritating at best and the character images recycled in a non-imaginative and cheap way. I am happy to support this genre in the future, but would not buy this particular game again, even from a sale."
