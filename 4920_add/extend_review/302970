The soundtrack is a mix of catchy space and lounge tracks and the graphics are beautiful coloured 2D animations.Played a lot of Tower Defense games which were simple windowed *.exe files (Grassland TD) or more complexe ones (Revenge of the Titans) but this here is my absolute favorite TD game.By spending the five bucks, you will get a game without a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in-game store (Yes, I look at you Ubisoft!).I prefer games, where you can pay a price and get everything in it, instead of trying to win by paying cashGood move, Hexage! And now give usRadiant HD with Controller support (*_*)"
,Not Recommended,302970,11597315,"Posted: 7 August, 2014",all,Baroque,"The difficulty people are talking about is not due to clever design but due to annoying 'features' (bad design). For example you can run a wave once and be unsuccessful, and run it a second time (with the exact same setup) and be successful. It's seemingly random.It often depends on the direction your towers are facing when you start a wave, because they take sooo long to turn around and face the enemy.Another design flaw is badly tiered difficulty of waves. For example on level 7, waves 1-10 are easy and can be beaten with 3-4 towers. Suddenly waves 11 and 12 are next to impossible, even if you've been saving the max resources per round. Now all of a sudden you need 6-7 towers just to barely scrape by. There was no preparation for this. Another example is often when you do scrape by those difficult waves, the next 8-10 waves will be super easy enemies that you faced earlier in the level. It jsut doesn't make sense.The dificulty doesn't ramp up like it should: easy medium hard insane. Instead it spikes randomly in waves: easy easy easy HARD easy easy INSANE, etc.Like other people said the controls are clunky. It's not a problem during the setup rounds between waves, but mid wave it's harder than it should be to set up a tower.There's no backspace function like in Defense Grid. You cannot 'Undo' tower placements without selling them for a loss. 1 mistake can cost you the mission and you have to restart, making it very difficult to optimize your bases. This gets frustrating since the levels are SO long (45 waves at level 7).Note to the designers: Do 10 waves WELL, instead of 45 waves SLOPPILY. It's just annoying how many hours it can take to finish 1 mission after you do get it on lockdown.Another problem is enemies can walk off the screen, so you can't even see them. The map does not scroll.For all of these reasons, the difficulty of the game is due to Design Flaws and Not clever design. I cannot recommend this game."

As military commander your only help comes from a scientist providing you with new technology and weapons.'Radiant Defense' is a tower defence game in space. Its colourful, glowing look is beautiful and the comic style can be deceiving. That's because 'Radiant Defense' is not a simple game. Some players even claim it's too hard altogether. But in my opinion that's not really the case. Yes, the game becomes difficult in the higher levels but it's a clever difficulty. While difficult sometimes leads to frustration in 'Radiant Defense' difficult is challenging and inspires to keep trying again and again until you finally win victory.Pros:- nice graphics- good music- clever game design- very good selection of weapons and enemies- freedom to build your own route in most levels- more than 300 waves of aliens across 14 missions- pauses between waves allow you to arrange your weapons- you can repeat any wave without loosing money if you do not upgrade towers before starting the wave. This allows you to experiment.- the game automatically saves progress for each level. You can simply stop playing and return right to were you stopped any time later.- nice tactical component for money. Dead aliens fill your purse but you can increase the money earned by placing money boosters. Additionally you collect further money depending on your funds at the end of each wave. This adds to very interesting tactical twists.- high number of waves- nine upgradable weapons- three super-weapons for mass defenceCons:- online hall of fame seems to contain cheaters and you can't find your own position- one achievement seems bugged (Endangered Species)"

In most tower defense games you can figure out a pattern and keep applying that strategy as you go.  This game you have to reinvent your strategy every new course.  Sometimes you can only place one block, sometimes you can create elaborate mazes.  New enemies are introduced on most courses which make you winning method obsolete.  You get frustrated, yell at it but then eventually/hopefully come up with a way to win.I wish the developers would allow you to move the map with the keyboard.  Having to hold down the left mouse button and move the map while trying to place weapons in a game can be unnecessarily frustrating.  Also it would be nice to know when you upgrade a weapon what actual percentage more damage it does.  Lots of guess work is needed."

76561197996136667,Recommended,302970,29869366,Posted: 12 February,all,SWCarter,"Radiant Defense is a tower defense game.  Its missions are played on a grid.  Enemies get one or more starting points, and they have to make their way to the ending point.  Towers have to be placed on modules, and while there are fixed modules for each mission, you're also allowed to put some down yourself, which means you're allowed to change the route of the enemies.There are about a dozen different towers, including machine guns, laser guns, sniper rifles, and tesla towers.  There are also super weapons, which are more expensive than regular towers but have much better attacks.  Regular towers can be upgraded four times during missions.  There isn't any upgrading outside the missions.There are also a dozen or more types of enemies.  They can be fast; they can be shielded; they can spawn more enemies; they can be resistant to some of your towers; and more.  The in-game information isn't great, so you have to learn by playing and trying things out.The missions in the game tend to be long.  Most have over 30 waves, and the peak is somewhere around 70.  Luckily, you get a save before each wave, so if one goes badly then you can load and try again.  This is friendly but also necessary because your score for each mission depends on how much money you have unused at the end of each wave.  So your goal is to kill everything while spending as little money as possible, which adds a little extra strategy.Overall, Radiant Defense is a pretty vanilla, but it works well enough, especially for the price.  It doesn't do anything new or innovative, but it's colorful and humorous, and it took me over 30 hours to beat the 15-mission campaign plus earn all of the achievements.  The campaign starts out very easy but then gets tough at the end, so don't give up on it after only an hour or two."
,Not Recommended,302970,33497052,Posted: 13 July,all,Tman,"The first 10 or so levels are pretty decent. A lot to like in a TD game, with a lot of variety in waves, the auto-save feature in between waves so you can retry a wave if something slips through, a variety of towers to make you think about how to do it, etc.There are some annoying things - towers turn so slowly; waves are not repeatable meaning you can just redo a wave exactly the same way & you'll get different results; fast forward seems to exacerbate this.But then it introduces what I affectionately term ""the meatshield boss"" which invalidates any pathing / tower variety / etc you might have employed. You basically have to find and retry (or go watch some replays to get a strategy) to use a minimalist setup with your wide variety of towers so you can plunk down 10 missile towers, because nothing is going to work at all against the final 5 or so bosses except missiles.Having to restart a level from the beginning because you can't handle the final boss is just stupid design. And only having one real weapon to combat these bosses takes away the entire point of having all these variety of towers."

These two aspects alone are a deal-breaker for ANY tower defence game!---------Artistically, this game is fine. Programmtically, this game has no major technical issues. However, I cannot recommend this game because it has serious design flaws.I only played for 10 minutes and ran into several design issues:* UI is not as straightforward to use as it looks* Enemies do not path in ways which make sense* One hit death: You take ONE POINT of damage, you lose and have to do the wave over* Towers select RANDOM targets, not targets closest to the end of their run, meaning luck plays a huge factor in how well you do rather than skill* NO RAW STATS FOR ANYTHING (Not damage numbers, not firing rates, NOTHING!)Also, I should point out the game heavily borrows design concepts from other better TD games. For instance, the first, third and fourth towers here are COPIES of the first, third and fourth towers from Defense Grid. Not graphically but in terms of function."

This is a great tower defense and it's great that it's on PC and it's great that it's so damn cheap!  Just know before you buy that it's a pretty bare bones port.  From my limited experience with the android version the PC version is identical, which is fine.  I'm not gonna complain, it's five ♥♥♥♥ing dollars!It's just that the interface ends up feeling a little awkward.  You have to do a lot of clicking.  The most annoying result of the port being that in order to figure out what a tower was I had to click it first.  Right click to return or cancel would have been a nice addition, but instead you have to click a cancel button.  Or click a build button, then click where you want it, then click again, then click your heels together.  Just a hell of a lot of left clicking, you understand?  No right mouse, no keyboard shortcuts, no graphics options, in fact the options menu if i remember correctly just has volume sliders.But what do you want?  It's radiant defense and it's five bucks.  Go buy it, it's worth it.  Just don't be disappointed by how tablet-ey it feels.  It's worth it still."

Seriously, I've been playing TD games for years and while the core mechanics are pretty good, you're either going to be replaying levels a dozen times or staring at youtube videos of level strategies.

I think the game is good.(optional let's play footage - coming soon)http://youtu.be/hihHmhhnrmUI think graphical quality is good. I like the music and the sound effects.It's a tower defense game. If you have a played a lot of these types of games before I wouldn't say that it really innovates. But so far I think a pretty good implementation of this type. It has few useful features. For example if built something in the wrong place you can get a full refund if you sell it straight away and you also speed up time during the waves, so that the game isn't so slow. You seem to have good variety of turrets to build. Some require you to have a tech structure first. I noticed that there seems to be only 15 levels, I'm not about that though.The game is easy to get the hang of the basics such as turret placement. You need to get to know the characteristics of the different types of turrets. Obviously some ordinances are more effective against certain types and amounts of enemies. However rotation speed of the turrets also comes play, some are very fast while are so slow enemies can get past them.I like this game. I like trying to find the best turret placement, combination of turrets etc. It was fun. But if the game only has 15 levels it may be relatively short. However later levels should be increasingly difficult and have more waves.Clickherefor more let’s play videos =)"

I've played loads of Tower games that provided a challenge but were beatable with a quick re-think of my strategy for that particular wave of enermies. With this game, it feels like if you don't start putting down the perfect sequence of towers from Wave 1, you're doomed to fail by mid-level, and the wave reset won't help because you won't have enough resources to build what you need to. Everything else about the game, i.e. music, graphics, choice of towers etc is great.I'm all for a challenge but this is just frustrating, and I gave up."

Most of the towers have a firing arc and a set rotation speed, but the AI on the towers loves to point them in the least helpful direction. If you fail a wave, restarting it and changing nothing about your tower placements and upgrades is just as likely to bring a win as reworking everyhing that you previously tried.The game isn't outright bad, but it's meant to kill time as it's nothing more than a port of a smartphone game."

If I were giving it a grade on a scale from 1-10, I'd give it a solid 7.  It doesn't do anything genre-defining like Orcs Must Die or Kingdom Rush, but it does put the standard tower defense pieces together well to create a challenging experience.If you research this game for more than 30 seconds, you'll see that people complain/rave that it is very difficult.  It is definately a very challenging tower defense game, easily one of the hardest I have played.  Unfortunately, the difficulty often comes as a result of poor wave balancing.  The difficulty really gives very low margin for error, causing you to not experiment too much in the obvious formula to success.Also, unlike a lot of the best tower defense games, there's really no tower-progression or leveling up through the campaign - you have access to all of the towers right away.  This creates somewhat of a rinse-repeat feeling by halfway through the game that never goes away as nothing very new presents itself throughout the entire game except stronger and stronger waves.I would definitely recommend it to genre fans like me looking for yet another Tower defense game to play.  For all others, I'd suggest first knocking out genre classics like Orcs Must Die, Dungeon Defenders, Kingdom Rush, and Bloons TD before spending your time on this title."

At the end of each wave interest is applied to the total amount of money you have left. This leads to many instances where you think you are doing ok but then you hit a brick wall. The only way of progressing is to start again and make sure you don't overspend too early. This creates a unique challenge where you have to very carefully monitor whether you need to spend the money or not. I spent several days, and hundreds of attempts on some levels to get them finished. Mastering the interest mechanism is absolutely critical to completing some of the more challenging levels, and it is clear that the developers must have spent an age play testing it.Superb"
