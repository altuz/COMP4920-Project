76561198103932397,Recommended,303340,10387047,"Posted: 7 June, 2014",all,generallymistaken,"TL;DR: 4.5/5 Would recommend, Fun time waster for a cheap price, great music and gameplay, just look past the artwork.I was looking for a new time-waster and although I normally purchase a cheap SHMUP or side-scroller from the PSN but I saw a couple interesting reviews for Concursion and figured I would give it a try.I knew from the advertising material that it started as a bit of a Mario-Clone but it pretty quickly becomes a combination of the other games highlighted in the gameplay video.  I was immediately reminded of some older Flash games that I had played years ago but the difference was I actually enjoyed playing Concursion for more than a couple minutes.I have been replaying the levels after completion to go back for the time achievement and the extra Gem Shards that are hidden or hard to pick up, so I can effectively get two/three times the playtime for my money!  (So far I have completely wasted my Friday night and Saturday, ‘cause that’s cool)I have found myself replaying some levels incessantly, ala SuperMeat Boy, to try and best the time challenge (and also taken a couple breaks because of extreme frustration).  It also has slight puzzle elements that were integrated just enough to not get annoying or change the game.  Sometimes the Maze (PacMan) levels really got in the way of the gameplay, but those seemed to be kept to a minimum.I loved that some story elements were included and the story itself, but I would have liked to see more, more voice work and MORE story to tie everything together.  Essentially the worlds get “broken” apart and we are running around in them, but the story itself did not need to seem like it was also a little broken.I thought the music was awesome, it helps the transition elements of gameplay a lot and is generally fun to listen to even when you are replaying a level over and over, I did not find myself muting the music or replacing it with my own, as I often do playing most games.Unfortunately, I disliked the artwork as much as I loved the music, but as this is a first attempt from Puuba Studios I figure you have to choose where your money and effort go to.  I did eventually become accustomed to it, and I did like how many of the bosses were animated.I would love to see this game re-skinned and released for PSN (or Xbox Live) with some extra DLC, I would buy it again.  Oh, and how about a Level Editor? I would love to remake some SMB levels with some of these weird tricks thrown in!4.5/5 -- Because of the Artwork and my interest being piqued but not satisfied by the story I docked half a point, otherwise a perfect game to play for as long as you have and be able to walk away and pick up again later."

The premise of the game is that the universe is being torn apart, and there are rifts all over each level which, as you enter them, lead to a different world, which turns you into a different hero with totally different powers.The 5 characters you play as are a knight, which is very similar to super mario, a ninja, complete with a sword, double jumps and wall hangs, a space ship which leads way into shmup style levels, a little bull thing that plays like pac-man and an astronaut who has a jetpack but no means of attack.Individually all 5 styles are handled well, the controls for each character are very tight and I never once blamed a death on the controls.  Each character, on its own, is very fun to play, but where this game shines is the way the characters are integrated into one anothers level.  You may think it is just a gimmick, but the reality is that the way the genres cross each other is brilliant and the further you get into the game, the more wild the cross overs become.The difficulty curve in this game is handled extremely well, this is not an easy game, and you will die a lot but the difficulty progression is very smooth.  The game starts out easy enough as you play a few introductory levels to learn the characters and as you progress the levels and the cross-overs between them get increasingly more challenging, but you never feel overhwhelmed, nor do you feel that anything is cheap.  The beauty of this game is that some things will seem insurmountable when you firts look at them but before you know it you are completing insane challenges like a pro.There are also 3-4 gems in each level, very similar to the 3 big coins in the new super mario series.  SOme gems are right in your face but tricky to access and others are cleverly hidden, obtaining all these gems is important to the story, but more importantly you will have a blast trying to collect all of them.  This game is also sprinkled with some humorous moments that pays homage to some old games, be sure to read the titles to every level.  The story here is also well done, it is a platformer so don't expect anything crazy but there is more of a story than your average mario clone and even a funny little twist that I will not spoil for you here.I cannot recommend this game strongly enough, if you are a gamer you owe it to yourself to give it a try, it is unlike anything you have ever played or probably ever will play.  It is an absolute blast from start to finish and I cannot think of a single thing in this game to complain about.10/10"

It's a bit like Super mario world, you walk over a map and you have to beat a level in order to move on.Game is quite funny!Music is pretty good!The music changes too if you change from character.There are also collectable shards.There is normal and hardcore mode.Other things.It has a bit of Mario References too.if you really like platformer, i do have to say this game is worth the price.-------------------I give this game a 9/10"

,Recommended,303340,12253032,"Posted: 26 September, 2014",all,RealmCopier,"I literally allowed this game to ruin my life, and I liked it.The first things that attracted me to the game were its artwork and the fact that it's a platformer. I LOVE platformers. If I could gather up every platformer there was and play them all, I would. And the artwork is the kind that I like, smooth, high quality, but simple.I picked up the demo during the speed run competition and got like 17th or something (I didn't really try for very long), so I decided to buy the game instead, and let me tell you, it is the most worthwhile £7 I have ever spent. For a game with as much replay value as this, I would pay closer to £50.I then played the game and enjoyed the fact that it did have a difficulty curve, but I never felt like it was too difficult. Then the music. Where do I begin with the music? This game has one of the best Soundtracks ever, it's better than games by massive developers who spend 5 years developing one level of a game.All in all, this game is probably my favorite to be released this year, and I look forward to more games from Puuba.10/10"
76561198072182182,Recommended,303340,12855132,"Posted: 8 November, 2014",all,Zeebrax the Astral Lifejacket,"Devotees of retro and neoretro are no strangers to the mashup: a type of game collection that offers ""lite"" versions of various game types (SHMUP, platformer, etc.), selectable from a central hub.Concursion, however, takes the concept of ""mashup"" to a whole new insane sphere by jamming as many as five disparate genres into thesamefield!  There is no neat pick-and-choose here; you must actively guide the behorned Questy Guy from one sparkle-bordered genre zone to the next, and while he retains his momentum in the crossing, his appearance and moveset alter completely -- as do the characteristics of any enemy that happens to drift over!  Sometimes these shifts occur with such dizzying speed that it almost seems like madness at first, but a meticulous method always becomes evident before long.  The diamond brilliance of the level design shines through this controlled chaos, which is present in endlessly inventive configurations of genre zones and in the occasional wildcard bit that breaks the rules of allConcursion's fractured worlds.And what of the graphics?  They are a bit coarse perhaps, a bit raw, a bit mismatched, sometimes even a bit MS Paint. In short, Aubrey Beardsley definitely did not serve as chief art director.  But you know what?  The graphics are imperfectly perfect, heta-uma,  prettily pockmarked.  Not only do they suit the merry madness of the level design, but they radiate this bubbly ""can do!"" exuberance that infected me from the first!  In fact, I almost love the game's awesome attitude (and therefore its art style) as much as its engaging level composition!With a fantastic chiptune score and an interesting narrative to sweeten the pot,Concursionis a game that every  indie-lover with twitchy fingers should get.  I'm in disbelief that the reviews are not overwhelmingly positive!"

It blends together different styles of platformer styles seamlessly and in a way that doesn't leave you confused about what is going on.

As soon as I find comfort with one set of mechanics I get challenged by another, and having this all culminate in the absolute bananas of multiple styles in a single level.... wondeful.  Clearly created by someone with a deep seeded love of the genre.  Well done."

I think the critical thing is that it really mixes them in a way that is fun and innovative. The graphics aren't the best, but they do a great job of recreating the art design of console and arcade games. The sound tracks is really, really good.It's really fun to try and race this game. People have been trying to beat times on this and they're thinking of releasing new maps just for that."
,Recommended,303340,27832233,"Posted: 27 November, 2016",all,Ducain,"I really liked the concept of this game a lot.  Mixing the basics of some classic game types into zones, and they creating semi-new mechanics out of this interaction is very cool.  The art, animations, and sometimes non-clear transitions can be jarring at times, but I would LOVE to see a second version of this game when they can maybe make it 2.5D and add/fix some things.  Some people have some decent critiques of the game, I can agree with some, but the levels are short and there's plenty of checkpoints, so the little naggly things (for instance, those teeny-tiny asteroids of pain, that are hard me to see against the background!) didn't bug me too much, ESPECIALLY since this is such a cool, unique idea.I definitely recommend getting and playing it, it's cheap, and it's a pretty well-done project.  I'm really hoping the developer comes back to this concept for a sequel to make a refined version of this game with some of the following elements fixed/changed (they weren't deal breakers for me, but I hope the second incarnation of this game has these changes).1)  2.5D like trine, bittrip runner 2, etc2)  More control over zoom-view (sometimes sections would be artificially too hard based upon how much area around the character you can see)3)  Analog control of movement - I know it's ""retro"" to have digital control of movement input, but I think it would serve to expand the game with analog movement.4)  Control over zone change - this I'm not so super sure about, but I think it would be awesome if done correctly*I'll add more if I can think of them."

Pops a message about having to enable it prior to launching even though it was already done. Tried using KB+M to navigate main menu but game did not respond. Tried unplugging controller - same messages and problem. I tried disabling Steam Overlay in case it conflicted with the game. That did not fix it. I decided to give up. Game looked very juvenile in tone, with clearly low budget cartoony assets, green gems and young boy protag pitted against a vaguely bowzer-ish dragon enemy spitting flames. If i had to guess this one has green gems instead of coins. Anyways, I am deleting this game for declutter."

Shows dialog about plugging in a controller, which I have plugged in.On the title screen, nothing happens. Nothing on the controller changes the menu. Nothing on the keyboard I could find changes the menu. There's no mouse cursor. I quit the game (using alt-F4, as you can't quit normally) and tried it without the controller plugged-in. No change.In fact the only control that kind of worked, and I found this by accident by spazzing out on the Xbox controller trying to get the game running, is if you hit the Xbox logo key the screen kind of dims and gets bright a couple times. That's it.Not sure if it's incompatible with Windows 10 or what, but. Game simply does not work on my PC."

Very rarely have I raged like this, but when that first boss, who is crazy boring but also somehow still massively hard for the point in the game it exists at, finally let me get beyond the industry standard '3 jumps on the head' and went up to five i was like, honestly, screw this. i wasn't even having fun. i was just annoyed at it. i'm not bad at platformers, i just generally have to sit down a bit and get back into the zone - i love meatboy, i've destroyed almost every mario game, play hundreds of platformers yet for some reason this one just felt 'cheap'. Maybe it's the art/music/design combos and maybe it's just because the difficulty swings wildly from extremely easy to 'what', but while this one has a cool concept, it's just not winning me over."
