Music is pretty bad, but I've heard worse. I even kinda like dubstep, but I personally wouldn't really call this music that. Honestly I wouldn't recommend buying this game to play, only to get the cards like I did, I suppose, if that's your thing.---Laziness made me not make a real review after I was Steam messaged by the ""dev""(or at least the ""dev"" of Road Redemption, their profile says they are the publisher of many games on Steam AS well as ""100% free games for influential Steam members"") offering me a free Steam key for Road Redemption if I wrote a real review, whether good or bad. Free game for just a fair review.While I understand that devs probably dislike comical reviews like mine that truly doesn't say much about the actual game, I also don't believe in them paying someone who has a popular comical review to write a ""real"" review.I guess I'm all for transparency, and I just think paying off reviewers for any kind of review is even worse than my comical review.  Feels false, fake. Just my opinionImages of the chat records are in my ""Artwork"" section. Feel Free to check them out."

,Not Recommended,303390,15089230,"Posted: 28 March, 2015",all,Nighthawk,"PresentationDead Bits is one of those games that look amazing at a first glance, just because it's different and it baits you with cool concepts, which in this case work only on paper. The game begins with a short story about how the alien which you control, Quilly was abducted by another one named Quanton while he was sleeping and forced to complete all of his tests in order to escape. From there onwards you have to complete nine distinct levels which make absolutely no sense and only get more annoying and less cool as you advance through them; as for the story perspective, scrap all that because nothing the game has to offer makes any sense in that matter, as the levels aren't even tied-in, meaning you will have to select the next one individually from a menu once you've completed one of them. While the first two levels are the closest to what the game seemed to be from its trailer and screenshots, once you get over that, it only gets more annoying and pointless as time passes and you see how stupid it can truly become.Rating: 2.5GameplayThere are nine different levels, each meant to have its unique twist, starting with the first two that respect the cubic look of the environment, which is probably one of the main reasons that made anyone buy this thing, in which you will have to use the guns at your disposal to get rid of basic enemies, and continuing to the rest of the seven remaining levels which range from way worse to what the hell is this thing. While they are definitely unique in their own way, most of the levels won't even work properly as enemies will often get stuck or fail to spot you making the entire challenge feel ridiculous as you'll probably die falling through some inexplicably placed hole more often that you will by actually being defeated. On top of all that, the bugs are countless as you will often get pushed by invisible enemies off the map, jump in the wrong direction or not being able to jump at all when you should.Rating: 1GraphicsThe cubic look of its universe is probably what attracted anyone to this title, but unfortunately it only looks like that for the first two levels, which you can complete in less than three minutes; from there onward the game tries to be unique by adding a new twist to each level, making horribly designed mazes, dark corridors that feel pointless above scary and one way alien space ship highways designed using Microsoft Paint.Rating: 2AudioThe sound effects are as basic as they can get, meaning that you'll probably find them in the first page of Google results under some basic sound resources website; as for the soundtrack it doesn't sound exactly horrible, but neither is it good or fitting the game in any shape or form, as it ultimately comes down to whether you like repetitive electronic/dubstep, but even if you do there are only a few songs, so you can probably just get them without having to play this abomination.Rating: 2.5ExtrasIf for god knows what reason you decide to complete this entire game, it might take you up to an hour and a half, and aside from that there is nothing else to do around since none of the levels are fun nor challenging to provide replay value and there are no achievements or leaderboards to reward you for actually putting through with this.Rating: 1VerdictI honestly thought this was still part of Steam's Early Access programme since it feels unpolished, unfinished and pointless in its current stage, but that isn't the case since this game has been out for almost a year to date and there is still no reason for why someone would want to play this for more than five minutes.Rating Overall: 1.8Check out the full review and a lot more about Dead Bits athttp://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=326"

The first one consists entirely of shooting a few block-zombies. The second stage features more block-zombies, and an additional gun. The stage after that? More block-zombies, and a bat. There's a stage where you don't get any weapons, and giant block-golems(?) take pot-shots at you with boulders. These aren't particularly interesting, well-balanced, or even fun gimmicks. They're more like those parts in your favorite games you always dread, but with slippery controls, worse platforming, and cheap deaths.Normally I'd write up a long list of ideas that could be implemented, for Dead Bits to approach some level of entertainment. However, I'm going to guess we're far beyond that point now. In fact, with this game I wouldn't even know where to start. Should I write that Dead Bits would be fantastic if it....was never made in the first place? That's not exactly constructive is it? Maybe I could say that it'd be great if this game was really unstable and crashed all the time, so then I wouldn't be able to play it. Hmm...I guess I better quit while I'm behind.Dead Bits isn't the worst game I've ever played, It's probably not even in the top 100. I think that says more about me than anything. Aside from the all-important cards, this is not a game you would want to spend any time with.Gotta admit though, I like the music."

The intro was, but after that it was less of an eyesore than expected, and navigating was tolerable to a degree. Except for the pitfalls. Everywhere.Combat...ugh. It gets boring really fast. Only 3 weapons, aiming is a crapshoot, and there's no variety. Enemies charge at you in straight conga lines. And there's a bad attempt at emulating slow motion bullet-time or something when you get enough combos or hits, which really doesn't help if the player slows down too.I wouldn't call this a game. At least not in the professional sense. It's equivalent to someone putting their mediocre grad school ""final project"" up for sale, like first time app developers who excitedly throw their piece of crap onto the iMarket carousel hoping they'll become the next Angry Birds.With that in mind (whether true or not) I cankindof forgive some of the crap factor, but playing this was still a terrible experience.

Friends, do yourself a favour, most of you should have Steam trading cards in your inventory just sitting there. Sell two of them on the community market for 7 cents each. That's all it takes to get this game!I feel like the game developer Rafael Capelini Carminatti deserves support. At first I thought that maybe he may have been one of the many greenlight devs that just want to cash in. But after playing Particula which is a 3 player co-op tower defence game that he also made. It's pretty clear that although his games appear simplistic, he understands gameplay design and is experimental with the game engine.Dead Bits is an FPS in which you must get from start to end. If you die anywhere along the way, you have to restart from the beginning of the level. There are 9 maps. I played the first 6 with the mentality that this was going to be one of those really hard games to pass. Sure enough it seemed hard and annoying at times, but it's all doable. I'm going to assume that the annoying parts was intentional and just clever by design. Give those players who are gluttons for punishment what they want!Then I remember taking a few months break, played level 7 then stopped for no particula reason ... pun intended. Over a year went by. After getting angry with life problems, I decided to launch Dead Bits again. Loaded up level 8. I started to remember the Dub-Step music. The awesome sound flowed into my ear canal, pumped through the veins in my head and exploded a few glial cells. It felt great!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hHZarmkZ_IAnother thing I noticed was that all of a sudden it felt easier than what I had remembered. In fact I found the experience quite relaxing. There were even funny WTF and what do I do now moments. The entire soundtrack is unlocked at the end ... nice reward in an old-school sense. And a bit of mystery with another character popping out in the end cinematic ... a hint for a sequel maybe?btw: (Dead Bits)Unity Game Engine !== (Minecraft)Lightweight Java Game LibraryI don't understand how people can make that comparison."

There is no retry button, save for the last level, which restarts on it's own when you die.There is a certain bit of trial an error in the game... The weapons are farily weak, yes. But it does add to the panic of the game... and some cheap deaths I mentioned above.The level designs are pretty meh until you get to the 6th and 7th levels. Then they look really cool, but the platforming is still rough, 8th level is unique, 9th is a gauntlet. Be warned... the 5th level is super frustrating...The soundtrack is awesome! I really enjoyed listening to it. Even when I was growling in frustration, the music (when it played) was entertaining and kept me somewhat involved.This game is far from perfect. I recommend this game with a caveat: Don't come into this expecting perfect physics and amazing controls. This I see as more of an art project.

Now without criticizing the graphics the music is trash. I mean dubstep can be okay but this is like some kid recorded the tracks on his computer and thought it sounded good. The level design looks like you threw a bunch of blocks into a blender and dumped out a design for a level. I think the main problem was not the difficulty, but how the game throws groups of enemies at you with out any warning. The hardest level in the game is ""Test 6"" , the boss glitches out and starts throwing balls at you from everywhere, sometimes even above you, and you cant aim above your character so you just get pelted with balls. Level 9 was actually three levels in one which was actually fair and made more sense because it felt like you actually had checkpoints and made progress. I'm really not trying to rant about the artificial difficulty but thats what it is, Its not hard, it's just unfair. Another problem is the random slow-mo trat occurs after killing set enemies in the levels. It's so annoying when you're fighting a group of enemies and then the games slows down and blairs dubstep in my ears. Maybe if you could lower the games music volume, but they didn't give an option to lower the music in the game unless you go to your sound mixer on your desktop. These petty problems alone annoy the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me. Every game should have sound options but when there isnt it is so anooying and off throwing that I really just get fed up with the game right away. Without talking about how bad everything is I actually had fun on the Ice level (""Test 5"" I think it was) it was so fun honestly. It felt like something new and it looked alright. The level was pretty easy, which was dissapointing because that was the only level I enjoyed. Maybe if you copied the idea for that level and made more similar to that, you could have some quality levels or something. When it comes down to it though, this game just isn't worth it. Even when I spent $0.14 on the game, it wasn't worth it. I beat the game I promise you that for $0.99 (Not on sale) you could buy 3 better games than this.

I know you might look at my hours and say ""Hey, this kid doesnt even have 100 hrs and she is making a review? Smh."" Please, hear me out.Ive played quite a few games in my time and all memes aside.Its been quite awhile since a game has put me through a vast array of emotions like Dead Bits has.Dead bits isnt a game, its a journey. From laughing at the intro to screaming like a deranged psycho on every level past the 1st, i felt like i was a part of the story. Im not gonna lie, this game hurt me physically while i was playing but i kept going, because ill be h*cked if i cant check ""beat dead bits"" off my bucket list.I was going to leave a negative review after the level you go to volcano-land. I couldnt handle having giant flaming meatballs being lobbed at supersonic speed towards me and i regretfully raged out, with no intent of ever returning. However a year later i came back due to the demand of a friend, and ill tell you that in my life as a gamer there have been few moments that felt as magical as blowing spicy meatballs out of the air and beating the level. The dubstep blew out my ear drums but i trudged on, level to level.(Slight Spoilers ahead)After i saw the final boss? I felt rage. I wanted to make him/her/it drown in volcanoland or get pelted by giant golfballs, but in the end the game really gives you a moral dilema. Rather than kill the boss, Quilly lets him live. Against all odds Quilly decides to be the better red-haired non-specified thing and walk away. Ill admit that this brought me to tears, i never expected a game with so many blocks to make me feel such RAW emotions.This game is very good at not being very good, i nominated it for the ""BEEST GAEM XDDDD"".

When you buy this game remember that you are going to pay either a dollar or less and you will get a game that you will beat within 2 hours, are the guns underpowered? Not really they do the right amount of damage for the enemies. Is the music too loud? To start the game yes but most games are so you can turn it down with windows or whatever OS you are using and you willl be fine as the gameplay audio scales with the music.The things I liked most about the game is the fact that each level is different, with a new set of challenges.

Once you leave the ground you can not turn in the air.The levels are called Test #. Seriously.The hitboxes for things such as trees seem to extend way beyond the tree itself which means you sometimes bump into one of these hitboxes at random.You have infinite ammo and even though this is my personal opinion I think most people agree that this isn't a good way for the player to feel any slight challenge at all.When you fall down for the weird flying platforms you get some sort of cutscenes where the so called zombies are killing you, how did they get there?The concept is very unoriginal and I'd go as far as to say that anyone with basic knowledge of game and software development could make a game similar to this.There appears to be a whopping 9 levels in the game.The overall physics engine seems both floaty and static at times and it makes the game very unfun.There are no hints in game that tell you anything about your objective or how to actually finish the level when you have killed off all the zombies.Zombies are such an overused game concept.The game gets very frustrating as you often fall off the face of the earth and have to start the 'test level' over again.If this game is a finished product then why the hell would the levels be called 'Test #' anyways??If you like unfinished and wonky piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥games with overused concepts, go ahead and buy it.

Haveing to sometimes do this 2 or 3 times before even starting the level can be very frustrating, esp as the levels are getting longer and longer.The levels are very narrow either with walls or death drop and the mobs are very large in relation to the world, the so far every level has you starting by dropping into the world being swarmed by 5+ mobs and you have no where to go but a drop death or blast through and hope you don't fall.Weapons are odd, the guns being unlimited ammo with no reload required. The MG needing lots of bullets to kill something, the shotgun needing 2 and yet a lead pipe needing only 1 hit.Even if you thrive on challanging games and do not mind repetition ( I don't mind replaing games or levels for chevos but this is something else ) I assure you that this game will push you over the edge, I must have spent nearly as much time playing as reloading from death.Warning watching the game intro will result in an epileptic fit, its tantamount to sitting in a room full of strobe lights with your eyes taped open."

,Not Recommended,303390,30798621,Posted: 28 March,all,Nats,"[SPOILERS (?) AHEAD]Disclaimer: I got this game on a heavy discount, for next to nothing. Over half of the game time is due to a Steam Idler. Beat all 9 levels.Dead Bits is a pixel-based FPS game, and its premise is that you're abducted by aliens to fight alien zombies. From the get go, you get the idea the game itself is going to be pretty off the wall in terms of content.The vast majority of things in the game world (even water, your enemies and yourself) are made of small colored cubes. As a result, the game itself is very colorful, almost having a childlike vibe to it. Given the blocky aspect of things, there's no much visual detail. The look of the game is complimented by a semi physics-based system which you can only notice when you kill something - the body's blocks fall in such a way, and you can shoot them around as well.The music compliments the game well. The vibrant colors make the music itself seem seamless, and the music starting up just as you pick up a new weapon and a bunch of enemies pop up as a result makes you feel like it truly is♥♥♥♥♥kicking time. That said, I detest dubstep, so the genre soured me on it as a whole.The pros end here. Now, the cons. The game is riddled with bugs and unfair gameplay, rather than difficulty. There are so many holes in the levels' surfaces that you'll find yourself more often dying from falling off the map than being killed. If you land a jump too close to something (a wall, platform, etc) you aren't able to make your next jump unless you back off first. The game's level progression makes no sense - you go from trees to tunnels to sky ice levels to hell to something straight out of sci-fi. The game's 'weapon switching system' is virtually useless since in most levels you're only given one weapon to work with (if at all). The enemies themselves aren't much of a threat at all and you can easily just make them run circles around you. Aiming is worthless since you do the exact same amount of damage hitting a leg that you do hitting the head (20 dmg for machine gun, 150 for rifle, 50 for alien blaster, and I forget the damage of the metal bat, I think it's instant kill for the smaller enemies at least).What secured the negative rating of this game for me were, unfortunately, the game breaking bugs. I came across three - for example, the hitboxes aren't reliable: you can shoot a zombie in the face with your rifle and it doesn't register a hit, and you can go through a healing block square in the middle and you don't get healed (dying unfairly as a consequence); in level 7, I noticed that if I didn't get the final 2 enemies to magically come to me (and I was horribly inconsistent with it), I would get locked where I was and fail the level due to running out of time; and finally, in level 8, the game would frequently lock me between enemy waves and not move onto the next.I can't recommend for someone to actually pay for this broken mess, and I'm not sure I would anyway if the game was free. While it does start out well enough, it soon gets really frustrating..."

,Not Recommended,303390,13633748,"Posted: 27 December, 2014",all,Gum,"This game is baffling. It's hard to understand how this got through the Greenlight program. First of all the graphics are ugly. I don't know if they were attempting a simple look with the boxy models like Minecraft, but there is no thought put into how things are modeled with the boxes or textured.Instead of attempting to fix very simple problems like enemies being placed too close to a high ledge they can't reach and hit you on the developer just set a wall there with a pop-up message that says ""nice try! jump down!"" Which had to be more work than simply moving the enemies to a place where they couldn't be fired upon from that vantage point.I was almost convinced it was an illusion, but I genuinely think simply looking at the ground for some reason slows down your character. That's the kind of weird misunderstanding of basic long established mechanics this game gets wrong.There are only 9 levels and most of your play time will just be spent trying to cope with the bad control and poorly mapped out levels. This game plays like something developed by someone who hasn't played a game since the Nintendo 64. That isn't bashing on the 64, I mean to literally say they forgot what a video game is since they haven't actually played one since the 90s.The only good idea in this game is the random contrived slowmotion that makes it easier to cope with the bad shooting mechanics sometimes."

I hate 2D/pixel ""art,"" but I like what's in Dead Bits (probably because the weapons don't look half bad (dat chrome bat doe)) - the water is one of the best things (so simplistic, such nice). The slow-mo a la Killing Floor is hit-or-miss. If you've got the mouse down pat, it'll be awesome. If you feel as though excessive mouse acceleration or something is in the game while just walking, it will be one of the things that kills you most.Speaking of the mouse, the head-bob and whatnot makes it seem as though your character moves more realistically than one would expect. Due to the weird controls, I can't dig it.Again, good idea. Though not original, I can appreciate that an attempt was made. That's just it though - it seems not much thought was put into the actual design. I am not raging just to rage - I can only hope (I do assume) that, what with Microblast Games trying to push another project through Greenlight, they've taken to heart all the criticisms within these Mixed reviews.

The floor disappears, there are holes all over it, and there are a disproportionately high number of enemies to a disproportionately small play area.Dying sends you back to the level select for some reason. Do you think I'd want to Test 3 again if I lost on Test 4? Hell no.Positives are that, on sale, the game is cheaper than the cards it drops.edit: The game is bad enough that I'm going to idle out the rest of the cards. It's not worth playing even when I'm forced to have the game open to get the card drops. The devs either A.) didn't try B.) didn't test or C.) are dumb.

The gameplay made it felt like I had a weight on my back at all times with its terrible jumping, and that fact that all across a level there are holes on the floor, so when your fighting an enemy and your going backwards, it won't be the enemy that kills you, but the level!

,Recommended,303390,13484582,"Posted: 20 December, 2014",all,Badinfos,"I completed the game in 1 hour and 30 minutes and I loved it, here is why:+ The game has 9 levels (tests) total, each one is vastly different from another. You have different monsters to kill in each one, in some you can drive a vehicle, in others you don't even have a weapon and you mostly have to parkour to complete it.+ Another thing I like is that you don't have to reload your weapons, once you pick it up, you can press the shoot button and never let go, that makes the big areas with many mosters slightly easier than it should, but I don't mind.+ The boss battles are very satisfying and difficult, especially the one in Test 6, that one was a doosie.+ NO CHECKPOINTS, you will die a lot and some levels are pretty lengthy, having no checkpoints makes the game much more difficult that it normally would be. I like that, saving anywhere you want is not to my liking, especially in a game like this. Sometimes it could be very frustrating ofcourse, but you can always replay the level.+ Tha graphics are nothing special, but I love the art style, punching a wall and seeing all the bits and pieces of it fly in random directions is very satisfying.============The game has many flaws aswell:- Jumping is weird and very floaty, you don't know where you are going to land and sometimes you can't move mid-air.- Walking feels a bit weird too and also floaty, in some instances you can walk over a one block wide gap, in others you can't. This is very apparent in Test 6.- There is no A.I. whatsoever, the monsters just run at you and if they get stuck behind a wall, they will stay there and you can shoot at them until they die. Sometimes they even fall from the world if there is a gap between you and them.=============Final words:I really liked the game. I got it for 14 cents with a 97% discount and already got my money back by selling trading cards, the game is worth so much more than that and I recomment it to everyone, once you get used to the jumpind mechanics, you will like it. It took me 15 minutes to see the appeal of it."

The combat is simplistic, repetitive, and tedious; the physics and platforming are wonky and unpredictable; the graphics are often hideous and/or epilepsy inducing; the difficulty ranges from stupidly easy to rage inducingly hard; and what little story there is seems kind of like the ravings of a mad man and feels somewhat unnecessary. But for some reason it kept me playing to the end. Sure it was incredibly frustrating, and I had already gotten all the card drops (enough to more than make up for the cost of the game, the main reason I even bought and played this), but something just compelled me to press forward and beat this game. I just wanted to show it who's boss. And I did. All in all I beat the game in about 2 and a half hours, including the wholly unnecessary post-credits cutscene in which you watch the protaganist sleeping for what feels like a full minute and a half as nothing happens (other than a brief one second glimpse of some strange duck-like creature that seems to be spying on our hero with no explanation).Get this game if you want free money, keep playing if you like dubstep made by aliens and getting ticked off when your character randomly spazzes out and throws himself off a cliff."

,Not Recommended,303390,16029519,"Posted: 27 May, 2015",all,TWD Kenny,"Honestly, I'd give this game a meh or a sideways thumb, but I honestly think it falls a little more under the thumbs down catagory rather than the thumbs up catagory. This game is more of a rage game than a happy, fun, shoot-em-up kid game. Even though you can tell this is definitely centered towards kids, this really isn't as fun as you'd think it is. You can tell it's towards kids because 1. Dubstep (that's it's ONLY soundtrack) 2. Simple, blocky textures 3. It's an FPS recreation of Minecraft.GameplayIt's exactly as you'd think- an FPS version of Minecraft. Nothing against the developers, but this type of gameplay is getting stale. I'm honestly surprised there weren't any COD weapons put in this game, considering how cliche it is.StoryThe story isn't really that original and is very forgetful. You start the game where your protagonist is sitting on his porch and is abducted by aliens and is forced to do these tasks to earn his freedom again. So basically, he just enslaved him. I say it's forgetful because damn, I really forgot I was captured by aliens while fighting off these Ice enemies shooting gigantic snow balls at me. True story, it's in level 5.Gameplay MechanicsThe mechanics aren't exactly great in this game either. The developers chose not to go with checkpoints- which I think is a stupid idea. Without checkpoints, you are forced to restart the entire level if you die and quite frankly, dying is pretty common. Lots of the times, I'll get really far into the mission and then accidently fall off the edge of the platform I'm walking on and die, forcing me to restart the entire mission. This brings me to my next topic- enemies and how ♥♥♥♥ing overpowered they are.Enemy MechanicsNo matter which enemy you are fighting, 1 hit will always take away 12 HP and you only have 100 HP. The enemy AI is programmed to kill you with no cost whatsoever, and so your enemies will hunt you down until they kill you or you kill them.Killing enemies aren't hard at all, but when they stack up and you're against 3 or 4 enemies at once, they can kill you withinseconds.Frame RatesFinally, something good I can talk about. Frame rates are very smooth and do not drop below 50 FPS. This makes things a lot smoother and more easy to play.ConclusionOverall, I didn't have much fun with this game. It'd be a LOT better if they fixed jumping lengths (because on level 5, I died so many times just trying to get from spawn up to the giant ice enemy), added in multiplayer (both online and local), fixed enemy damage values, and maybe changed their gameplay a bit. I hate to bash on these developers because their game isn't really that bad, they just need some fine tuning before I'd call it a full retail game. 5/10"

You can get stuck in corpses or die randomly somewhere close to the end just because you ""didn't get"" the idea. And you start over. Mechanics are a bit awkward, something you would really need to get used to first. If you're considering buying it then wait until it's on sale. You know it's trashy. And probably not that Nicolas-Cage-way trashy you know, it's the real thing. This only has 9 levels but it would really be enough, trust me."

The game was very challenging, and not in the rage inducing way. The controls are fine, and are easy to get used to. Each level brings in a new game mechanic or uses a different game genre. I think the graphics have their own unique style that seperates itself from other FPS games, due to its' simple blocky worlds and (sometimes) orbular enemies. I'm not a fan of dubstep myself, but I found myself more than once humming some of the Dead Bits songs. They're catchy, fuses rock elements, and never gets too repetitive. It contains some of the only good dubstep/brostep songs you'll ever hear. The worst thing about it is that the platforming sections are too hard, as you have to be careful how far you jump. Still, I really loved the game, and it's one of the more unique FPS games you'll find here. 8/10"

Floaty mouse controls, no key customization, high default mouse sensitivity with no adjustment. No hitboxes aside from the one full body one so aiming isn't important, coupled with the fact that there is a dynamic crosshair but means nothing because bullets always hit direct center with no recoil, infinite ammo, and no reload. The later levels are all just trial and error being very long and drawn out with instant death triggers everywhere making the game not challenging but just very tedious.The whole game just feels like a concept design gone horribly wrong.

You'll complete them within 1 hour. Apart from those 9 levels, there's literally nothing to do in the game.There's no such thing as level design.Maps are just absurd -- random shapes, stuck together by more random voxel shapes.The game has an overall look like it was made within a weekend, by a 14 y.o. kid that was using some really bad free editor.

Sure, the story is horrible and makes no sense, and the grapics aren't good, but the game is still good. The story was so bad that I was laughing very hard. There are 9 levels in the game, but it still took me about 2 hours to beat the game. The gameplay was very fun, it's a first person shooter and you can collect a machine gun, a rocket launcher (that looks like a paintbal gun) a bat, and a lazer thing. The game plays dubstep throughout every level, and it's actually pretty good. The game is easy, but the final levels are pretty hard. It''s not an impossible game or anything. You fight zombies, UFOs, and many other weird alien things. This game is not worth 5 bucks thugh. I got it when it was 14 cents, and I'd say it's worth $2 at the most. If you pay 14 cents for it like I did, you can also get steam trading cards in the game, which you can sell all of them for moore than 14 cents. Overall, I think this is a very fun game.7/10"

I'm not even the kind of guy to get motion sickness, and I also play a lot of video games.Short review: This game is awful and you should only buy it if you could sell the trading cards for more than you payed for it. It's a walk backwards and click on things simulator. I know it's made by one man, but I've seen roblox games that are better than this. This should be an alpha at best, which makes sense when you realize that each level is a ""test"". I feel like the creator just said ""screw it, I'm bored of making this game. I'll just sell it as is for five dollars without a sale."". EA wishes they had guys like this scheming for them.Long review:Menus:Options Menu: Only options are to change lighting engine quality, fullscreen mode, and mouse sensitivity. Mouse Sensitivity is only available for change when you're ingame, so you probably won't figure that out until you decide you want to play this windowed.Main Menu: Has Options Menu, a Question mark (which doesn't tell you how to play the game, it's the credits), a New Game button, and the exit button.Stage Select: Barebones flash-game-style level select, a 3x3 grid of levels. The thumbnails show extremely insignificant previews of the levels, but they're better than nothing.Graphics: They're bad. Graphics exist to serve the aesthetic, but there's no consistent aesthetic so graphics is all it really has going for it. The land is mostly square, caves and underpasses are partly square and partly curvy. enemies are trapezoids. There are no textures. Just different colors. The guns do not fit the rest of the game at all, they're cool-looking when the game should be going for whimsical or at least completely bad. There is graphics options. All it does is change the lighting engine.Plot: A bad excuse as to why you're doing what you're doing. Summarized:""You get abducted by aliens or something, now you have to fight zombies in what are probably simulations. whatever. I already got your money, just go play this game to make back as much as you can from trading cards.""Gameplay:Controls: Barebones, and you can't even configure them. You move with WASD, shoot with left click, zoom with right click hold. There is no sprint. This can make the game seem boring when you repeat, as you are forced to move at what feels very slow when you inevitably die to poor design. In TF2 and other games like it, you can air-strafe by holding A or D and moving your mouse. Not in this game, the jump is totally uncontrollable and you are commited to wherever it leads. scroll wheel does not change weapons, you HAVE TO use 1 2 3 for that.Weapons: They all suck.1: an SMG. It's accurate, fast and does very little damage. The most common weapon and the most practical2: a shotgun. It does more damage, actually only fires one shot (so you can only hit one enemy) and is slow. you will likely rarely use it, and even then you shouldn't use it exclusively.3: a bat. IT does less than the shotgun, fires faster, and has a range that never seems to be consistent.Other Stuff:When you die in a level that's it. It's back to level select. No ""retry?"", no checkpoints, no extra lives. you have to do it all over again.Stages:Stage 1: you have a gun and there are 2 enemies. Very short and dissapointing levelStage 2: Stage 1, except there's some pipes to go through tacked on with smaller enemies.Stage 3: You only have a Baseball Bat. You fight a boss. You fall into a cave filled with zombie conga lines.Stage 4: you go through pipes with a baseball bat. The floor is broken into pieces and looks horrible because of it. You fight more conga lines, get a gun, shoot big guys that hide little guys behind them, and then are forced to fight huge guys, then do awkward platforming to finish the levelStage 5: you fight a really big guy by walking backwards and clicking on him. You then get a shotgun and have to fight off crowds of weak enemies, which the shotgun is ironically useless against, considering that is the purpose of a real life shotgun. After that you run along a walkway with guys who throw snowballs at you. promising level, but still bad.Stage 6: Hell. You run a gauntlet with reskinned snowball guys who throw fireballs at you. The water that is present in other levels is replaced by lava, which kills you instantly. This coupled with the lack of air control means you will likely die a lot to stupid jumps. There is no music. Once you get to the end of the stage, you get a gun and music starts to play. Then a huge guy with like a million health who flies around randomly and throws fireballs at you appears. It is nearly impossible to beat him, as he can go straight above you and shoot at you, while you can not look straight up and shoot the fireballs down. You have very limited space to avoid his attacks. The level is long and arduous so it wears on you after all the time you have to spend getting back to the boss, not even taking into account the times you die to lava. I was tempted ot quit on this level, but I wanted to see if the game got any better after this.Stage 7: Timed Level. Long tube with instakill things that look like they should be powerups. periodic MANDATORY battles with enemies you've NEVER MET YET and are not used to. At least you're fast and jump good though.Stage 8: waves. health pickups that you can pickup at full health and waste. boring. repetitive. Kitefest. I quit here because it isn't worth it."

I got it for like 5 cents and im still disappointed because this game feels like a joke. I haven't finished this game because the seventh level (out of 9 mind you) can randomly fling you off the track, into the endless pit of death. Every time you die (and you'll die A LOT) it resets you, all the way to the beginning of the level. This isn't a problem with the earlier levels, but at least throw some checkpoints in there! In Conclusion, if its free, sure why not. but even at 99 cents, it isn't worth it."

Music is tolerable, but I've pooped out games with more depth in a 24hr game jam. It's not the worst game, but it's a silly toy.Agillity and strategy are not required, unless you call following the developer's shallow ideas strategy, and twitching around agilility. The game is somewhat good at identifying what you should do through pixel-y atmosphere and the obvious.

,Not Recommended,303390,23361264,"Posted: 3 June, 2016",all,Di - Ravello,"it's really bad. First of all the story doesn't exist and you suddenly got thrown into some crappy maps for no reason. Crappy because if it's an outdoor map, there will be so many holes on the ground that kill you more often than the enemies ( and every time you die you're forced to watch an un-skipable long scene of your character being banged by the enemies before being taken back to level selection menu. A quick restart button is not included ). If it's an indoor map it'll be a straight tunnel or similar, sometimes there are turns that serves no purpose because they're all dead ends without collectibles. Next up is the combat. For a game in which everything is made from cubes including the enemies, you'd expect to see features like crippling your enemies or tearing them block by block, but no. All enemies are solid, no cubes falling apart until they die. Also there's no different in damage dealt to different body parts including the head. Weapons are poorly designed, for example the shotgun's damage stays the same regardless of how far are you from your target ( there's damage spread so that's no slug rounds ).Overall this is a badly designed game. Kudos for making the game bug-free with colorful environment but it doesn't help with the mood."

The simplistic graphics, simplistic level design, and occasionally rough movement mechanics give the impression that it's the developer's first game. However, if you look past the faults (in particular the graphics), Dead Bits is actually quite enjoyable and even addicting. The gameplay is similar to old-school shooters like Doom and Quake, but with unlimited ammo and no ability to slow down, the latter of which is a double-edged sword. The music, though, is the best part of Dead Bits. Its seemingly simple soundtrack really increase the pace of this already fast game.

The story is (Can I call it a story?) boring and not well thought out. The textures of the weapons do not suit the other textures of the game at all and past the third level the block theme kind of gets ditched. The first five levels of the game are mind-numbingly easy and after that it is frustating when the game tries to put in parkour. Parkour which if you jump you have a chance of getting stuck in a wall and maybe falling of the edge aswell. To add to these bugs there are zero checkpoints, so if you glitch you have to start the level all over again which leaves you frustrated. The combat is repetative,  you just shoot 'zombies' with a gun with unlimited ammo and whack them with a baseball bat. Projectiles jitter around the screen so you never know if they are going to hit you or not and the game goes into slow-mo mode for no reason other than killing a regular zombie.My verdict?

It runs smooth, but looks like an early alpha build. The music isn't my cup of tea, but would go well if the action sequences were any more rewarding than running away from enemies while shooting them. You are much wider than you could possibly think you are and the gunplay is unfulfilling.

The music is not subtle either, its ridiculously loud and horrible dubstep.Second, is mouse acceleration. The game suffers from quite a lot of it. I guess its playable but it ruins the experience a bit.Jumping also feels weird, for a game that seems like it has low gravity you would expect the jumps to be much longer but are not.Variety is limited also, I've gotten to about halfway and it seems to have 1 melee weapon, a shotgun and an assault rifle/submachine gun. The enemies all seem to be different scales of the same texture, some huge and some small. The maps are hardly anything you want to search everything corner of but then again it cost me £0.11 and is made by a single person.If he/she were to add an option for the audio then I guess I could recommend it. If a few other things were fixed then I would recommend buying at slightly higher than the sale price which I paid. Although not the full price, I can get full AAA games for that price."

Check.  Sound?  Check.  Running and jumping?  Check.   Shooting?  Check.  Multiple weapons?  Check.  Enemies to shoot?  Check.I might complain about whether the components of an FPS are here well-integrated into a coherent experience or not, but there's no need to take the analysis that far because all those elements, while technically present, are individually and collectively ♥♥♥♥♥♥.Stage design is awful.  Graphics are crap.  Movement is passable at best.  Enemies aren't scary.  Weapons are sad.  The music is some forgettable techno thing, while the game sounds range from hokey to objectionable.Dead Bits would be meritorious if presented as some high-school student's first attempt at game design.  As a commercial release from an ostensibly professional development studio, however, it has thoroughly earned every thumbs-down rating it's received, and then some.For context, Dead Bits isn't ""Daikatana"" bad or ""Duke Nukem Forever"" bad, it's ""Big Rigs"" bad.

I would have been totally fine with a short, simple and not particularly inventive game, as long as it played reasonably smoothly.Dead Bits does not play smoothly, and most of the ""challenges"" felt rather unreasonable. Everything you encounter smacks of unpolished, slapped-together amateur work. I'm not talking about the low-res models or the art style; I'm talking about things like the giant cube hitboxes which don't fit the models at all, or the obnoxious visual effects which obscure the path ahead.The game is supposed to be a platformer at heart, but the level design is frustrating and seemingly pointless. Everyting is designed to rush the player into moving ahead without looking; but the frequent holes in platforms and enemy-clogged chokepoints make it impossible to just race through in time to the music. Instead, you're forced to take every section slowly and methodically, memorising the safe path and the enemy locations.There is nothing which saves this game, nothing which creates a hidden bit of fun to explore. It could have been an enjoyable game if only the creator had spent more effort on making sure that the levels were layed out better, that the enemies were in interesting locations and not just clogging the narrow parts of the track, and that the weapons available actually fit the challenges ahead. The effects and music show that the creator did put time into this game, and I don't want to simply disparge someone's work. However, as a game it simply doesn't deliver -- the gameplay is constantly interrupted by failings in the design and execution of the game idea.I can't reccomend this game to play."

Currently its on sale for 25 cents. And if your anything like me, your thinking of passing up this game due to the mixed reviews. Well I can say that the negative reviews should be ignored, as its clear the writers were expecting to much from this game. Its normally 2 bucks, and right now its 25 cents, what could you expect for that price? Anyways, lets talk about the game.This is a basic shooter at heart. Its a block based fps involving zombies, so nothing really new there. The gameplay is basic, you have three weapons, a sub machine gun, a shot gun, and a baseball bat. Shooting is smooth, and the performance is solid, no slow downs or hiccups. When you defeat one of the zombies they fall apart in a satisfying way. My only real complaint is the variety of weapons. But its a short game, and I cant really see a use of other guns.When it comes to the levels, they are typically well designed, starting off small and void of many enemies, and gradually grow in difficulty and length. The actual design is linear, but fun to traverse. The devolper did a good job of keeping the look of the levels varied, as well as the enemies you face. While its true you are fighting simple variations of zombies, they did a good job of keeping them all different looking, and I never knew what to expect from them. This game throws unexpected surprises in several places, that change up how you go about the typical running and gunning.This game also comes bundled with the soundtrack, which is worth the 25 cents alone. All the tracts fit the gameplay well, and are very good techno style music. The last thing I want to talk about is the games length. Its short, real short. You can finish in about an hour to an hour and a half. But when it comes down to it, I had fun running through this game, and for only 25 cents this is a worthwhile game."

I've always liked physics based games and just stuff that can be blown up with weapons. I really loved the look of the game and watched the trailer saying to myself: ""Wow! This has to be one of the coolest games released lately and it's only 4.99€!"". Although I payed 0.99€ for this.Unfortunately, the 1€ was too high price for this... demo game. Everything is wrong about this game... AI sucks, levels suck, the game is too short and the game just feels like a huge scam! There are plenty of free Flash games that are better than this game. Flash games! Those games are considered softcore/only for casual gamers but here I am, a hardcore gamer saying Flash games are better than this piece of ""game"".There's sop much potential about this game. This could've been a great game. Imagine. Multiplayer, co-op, level editor, Steam Workshop... It would've been great and would be awesome game to create levels in to.

If you ever get to grab this for, I dunno, less than the price of 4 Steam Trading Cards then this game is definetly worth of grabbing because of the Tradnig Cards...Every game you thought was bad is good compared to this one... Homefront? Masterpiece. Bad Rats? Hilarious piece of crap. Ride to Hell: Retribution? A fun game to waste some time.

It is more suited as a flash game you can play for free than a 5 dollar game on steam. I bought this on sale for about $1.50 and even then it was a waste of my money. I do not recommend buying this game to anyone who is expecting even a poor quality shooter as this game lacks anything that makes a shooter worth spending money on. Here are some pros and cons,Pros-Fun little shooter to mess around with for about 10 minutes.It has a decent soundtrackCons-Enemies are pretty much all the same and can be defeated with each weapon. The only variety in enemies is their health and their model. They all also seem to have the same AI.There are three weapons, all with unlimited ammo and all doing around the same amount of damage. There is a rifle a shotgun and a sword and honestly they all can be used for the same situations making the game very repetitive.The maps most of the time consist of random thin walkways and crappy parkour that are almost impossible to make on the first try due to the horrible controls.The game looks horrible. I'm not normally one to judge by graphics but honestly it looks like something that can be put together by a bunch of grade schoolers for a play.All around I'd give this game a 2/10. Fun for a bit but really too short and not worth even $0.50"

If that wasn't bad enough, while you're in firefights with ""zombies"" it will constantly go to slow motion mode. While this was kind of cool at first, it got old very very quick. The jumping mechanic in this game is also very broken. Sometimes you'll jump normal, sometimes you'll jump all the way across the map for no reason at all.There are two somewhat redeeming factors of this game:1) The high fps (You'll get somewhere between 200-450 fps)2) The money making (You can buy this game, leave it running, and sell the cards you earn for more than you paid for the game)so all in all i give this game.5/10You can throw this game out there with Atari version of E.T."

Now it's too short, I'll say that, 9 levels isn't exactly revolutionary but this game is a lot of fun. Now when a friend told me this was a 3d platforming fps I got a bad taste in my mouth. Platforming AND shooting? Sounds like a science experiment that exploads in the end. Well I'll be honest here, my expectations were blown. I really enjoyed this game. It's really cool. The first 2 levels are spent walking around a small arena killing... zombies? But the first cutscene said ALIENS! oh well. The next 7 levels become platforming levels with actual paths to take. I will say this, level 6 is a huuuuuuuuuuge jump in dificulty. I probably spent half of my time in this game on that level alone, but it was fun. At this point I am still stuck on level 7 but I plan on playing it more soon.Here's another bonus, I payed 14 cents, got 4 cards, made 16 cents from selling them. Who doesn't like profit?As for the soundtrack it's meh. I've heard better dubstep for video games and I'm sure they could  have done a little better then this but it still is pretty good.Would I pay $5 for this game? No. Not at all.$3?

If you're not interested in the game you can buy the soundtrack as a dlc. Even though you should buy this game NOW while it's 14 cents. I like the cinematic slow motion in this game when you get kills. This game has trading cards, essentially you can get trading cards worth more than the game. But I don't like the infinite bullets. You can shoot the entire playing aand you'll not run out of ammo. It ruins the experience for me. The AI in this game can get really hard when you're into the middle of the game. It frusterates you to the point you rage quit. The level design in this game is really boring. You get a small platform to work on when you play the game. If you just happen to fall of the map you have to start over. There's no checkpoints. Also, you can die out of nowhere just simply by getting stuck on an object. However, this only happened to me a few times. Lastly, there's no Steam Workshop. Why?? The game doesn't have many levels so why can't we create our own to play and share with the community. I'm sure somebody would create a multiplayer co-op. If this game had more features, it wouldn't get the amount of hate it has. Maybe add a speedrun mode? Where we have to kill as many enemies we can before the time limit runs out.STORY:There is no real objective. The protagonist gets captured by aliens and has to prove itself in order for it's freedom- by killing monsters. I haven't finished the game yet so I don't know what happens next.OVERALL:I'm only recomending this game simply because it's 14 cents. Otherwise, the game is not worth a dollar. The game is fun for 20 minutes but gets too repetetive. This game has a lot of potential. To reduce the hate: add more levels, fix the bugs, and ADD STEAN WORKSHOP SUPPORT. The game at it's current state is a 5.5/10. Get it while it's cheap :)"

I only played the first 3 levels, but the game seems programmed competently enough.  Although the graphics are fairly rudimentary, the hitboxes work, the weapons have your standard iron sites and melee range and jumping is responsive.  For a niche indie title it accomplishes what it sets out to do.  For it's bargain price it might be worth it for gamers who have enjoyed titled like Guncraft or Ace of Spades, although both those games are a lot more advanced and involved.

I literally just played for like half an hour and all of the cards dropped (4). I turned around and sold them for like 7 cents apiece, making a 100% profit.Gameplay-wise, the physics are kinda nice and the environments are cool for such a low-budget game. However, some levels can be really frusturating/hard to beat unless you follow an exact path and hit at certain times. I'd get stuck on one  level for an hour, then turn around and slide through the next couple in like 5 minutes.PROS: - Cheap- Provides about an hour of entertainment- Make your money back in half an hour (trading cards)- Environment is simplistic but coolCONS:- Difficulty varies way too much between levels- Short game, only like 9 levels- Every time you die, you have to restart the entire level which can get reeeeallly annoying- Blocky/pixel graphics might annoy you after a while- There are holes in the ground every few feet, so while running away from enemies you'll just        .             randomly fall and die"

This lack of control is especially difficult when you're trying to dodge enemy attacks near hazzards. There's one point I repeatedly fall off the edge of the platform attempting to fight a particular enemy. It can also be difficult to judge distances, and you might see a ""short cut"" only to find it's blocked by an invisible wall (couldn't you at least make like, trees or something to make that more clear?"" Graphical fidelity is low, as is expected from a game like voxel graphics aren't an excuse for texture clipping. Draw distance is short, but a decent fog at least makes it less obvious when things in the background are popping in and out of view. The sound assets are very generic. In summation, the only positive thing I have to say about this game is that I enjoyed its soundtrack. However, if you keep having to repeat a level because you can't keep your character from falling of the edges, then the same track repeating gets very annoying. I tried to give this game a fair chance, but I really cannot recommend it."

Level 5 is where the game really shows it's true colors, a boss fight right after a jumping puzzle, another jumping puzzle, more jumping puzzles, a corridor, jumping puzzle then shooting guys with huge balls from far away. The sixth level is hell, both in design and in how you play it. You start by running down another corridor only to turn a coner to go down another. At this point you see a big path that has a lot of lava which will kill you in one hit, you run down that while dodging big rocks; keep in mind that when you die you have to restart the level.

It also starts and ends randomly.I hated how much the mouse input was smoothened, made it much harder to aim.On ""Test 4"" you have to fight a series of enemies, then you get some giant enemies and a slight variation of the original enemies that are stonger and move quicker. Oh, and you have to do this while in a tight tunnel while standning on disappearing platforms.There's only 9 levels, which means that your playthrough could be done within a couple of hours at the most (provided that you aren't stuck on ""Test 4"", that is).Almost no replay valueI expected a voxel-based FPS (totally original idea) to have some form of level editor, but none was found (particularly a problem when there are only 9 levels).No multiplayer.And many other things I cannot be asked to talk about.Ugh, I'd rather play Grass Simulator."

The levels are small as crap, I mean like a 6 year old made the level design (Sorry for being so rude, I'm just very mad at this game)The level designs are like, well lets put some dirt here, some trees here, and some stupidly big monsters, and jumping that flies you off the edge :) seems legit.I mean come on man!!! I know you can make these levels bigger and/or better, because the level when your in the UFO surviving waves is plenty big, like perfect size for a good fast paced shooter! But then you go to normal levels and everything is cut to where you can run for like 3 seconds, and you hit the other side of the area!Also there are many other problems, like waiting 10 seconds in the air to finally start, when you die you go back to main menu, when you run diagonally your character runs 40 times faster, holes in the ground, levels that don't tell you what is bad and what's good, and just small spaces that by the finger tap on your keyboard sends you flying off the edge of the map.Just overall, this game would be soooooo good if it had a lot more work put into it.

The gameplay was quite solid for the most part but I found myself caught off guard by the difficulty spikes in the later levels. The trading cards are honestly what caught my interest initially but after a while I honestly couldn't stand the game due to the loud dubstep and the terrible melee range. I'll admit that the dubstep could be fixed by turning off the speakers but the melee range just overall is what blew the game for me. Each attack with the bat (or metal rod?) has to be timed precisely. I believe it was intetional to have such a delay to create tension but the game falls very far from tense.For it's low price and production value: 4.5/10

It's absolute garbage and nobody should waste the time playing it.I tried to appreciate it as like, a college project that a student felt like uploading to Steam but it's just not good.Need some examples?  The level menu levels are all called ""test"" with a number after them.- Every character, model, are in the game looks exactly the same with varying colors.- You start each level in a box with a looping, stretched water texture on the walls and floors that makes no sense,- When you die, no matter what you die to, you see zombies eating you despite there only being a few levels with zombies in them at all- The font is a generic thin font used for literally everything... and SOMETIMES it's a different color!  It's usually too small or the color blends wrong making it unreadable like a pathetic powerpoint some student had put together without a care.The ""game"" is just a test build for a class or something.  It's not worth buying.  Not for a dollar... not for a dime... don't."

The main problem is that the levels are way too easy or way too hard (for first walkthrough). If You play it for the second time, all levels become too easy. Sad that the game had much more potencial in it, I think.Oh, and can be harvested for cards of course... :D"

,Not Recommended,303390,29935411,Posted: 14 February,all,Raymond,"Dead Bits Review - Raymond KTConsidering the entire game was developed by one man, Dead Bits is a pretty impressive effort. Unfortunately, the game is lacking in almost every aspect when compared to its competition with the exception of its toe-tapping, head-bobbing dubstep soundtrack. If you're curious what's possible with the Unity engine and you like dubstep, it might be worth a look, and if you do, make sure to add on the soundtrack for a buck. Otherwise, stay clear. The combat is incredibly boring. There is nothing on the flat platforms for neither the player nor enemies to use as cover or anything else really, so all you can do is just move backwards while shooting them, and try not to fall off the platform (which is a bad design for the the game in first person view, and probably exist only, so the player will be forced to restart the game more often, and thus extending the play time)"

The game looks horrible, and is riddled with glitches. Find a unique style that is recognizable and does not require too much effort instead of pushing your engine to the limits to make a bad looking game. As a first person shooter, it has nothing to offer. No new mechanics, no new level designs, not even a good soundtrack. I know how hard it is to make a game, but this is still absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥"

All you really do is run forward, shoot enemies with underwhelming guns, and attempt to circle-strafe or dodge projectiles on narrow platforms.The plot is really, really dumb, which is saying something for a bargain bin Steam game. Graphics are mixed and matched to the point where it looks like the first pass of a student project. That's what the game is, really: a student project that got too big for its britches. Everything is overlaid withheadache-inducing dubstepthat still manges to be better than the game itself.Putting up with this game is an exercise in tedium and frustration. Avoid it."
