Causing mayhem on the streets comes naturally when trying to maneuver a car that never stops spinning. Inspired by games such as Kuru Kuru Kururin, controls are responsive, yet actually controlling where you drive is challenging.One can play through the main story fairly quickly, yet that is only part of the game. Numerous fun challenges await, there are collectibles en masse to be found, and a good amount of customizations to be unlocked. As a finishing touch, there's several goofy extra options, such as the Roundabutt mode.If you are looking for a unique gameplay experience, and enjoy indie games that take themselves seriously, but have a lot of fun while doing so, Roundabout might just be your kind of game. The store page offers a demo, so go ahead and see if revolving is your thing as well."
,Recommended,303430,28534077,"Posted: 22 December, 2016",all,Yoj,"Roundabout is one of those games that isn't easy to classify, let alone review. Your friends may also consider you crazy if you describe it to them: ""Well, you're literally spinning around the city in a limo, hitting pedestrians, jumping on rooftops, and blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up"" - they would probably give you a weird look or two after that.If we boil it down to the core gameplay, then Roundabout is first and foremost a puzzle game. In fact, the main game mechanic here is inspired by a lesser-known Japanese puzzle game Kuru Kuru Kururin, which is more than 15 years old at this point. But it would be a gross oversimplification just to label Roundabout as a puzzle game, since its much more than that.Gameplay-wise, you move around the map in a constantly revolving limousine, which is challenge in and of itself, since there are plenty of tight turns and obstacles or hazards in your way, that you'll need to manoeuvre around and avoid respectively, since it takes just three collisions for your limousine to blow up as though it was packed to the brim with explosives. So, timing and precise movement are key here, but you shouldn't really sweat it, since this game is pretty forgiving - blowing up usually isn't that big of deal. You don't really lose when blowing up, outside of various challenges and side-missions.So why is Roundabout more than just a puzzle game? Mostly because of its story, style and setting. Everything is presented in a style of a 70s B-Movie, with the appropriate story, style of graphics and music — and there's also FMV! It's one of those rare times when cheesy green-screen FMV really feels at home, and having a just a few actors for all of those roles makes it even better. There are also various side-missions and challenges available in Roundabout, usually centered around endurance, collectables for you to find on a pretty big ""open world"" map, upgrades and customization options which you unlock (both visual and technical), property aquisition, etc. All of this greatly increases the overall scope of the game, providing a sometimes needed distraction.With all that, Roundabout creates a very fun and relaxing puzzle game experience, which are pretty rare on the market. It's just the type of game that you need when you want to relax and wind down after a long day of work. Most people probably didn't understand this game, with SteamSpy estimating sales just at 38K copies at the time of this review, but I think you should give it a chance.P.S.

A game with a clear, well executed theme and a hilarious playthrough. The story is absolutely as silly as the gameplay, too. You play as a limosine driver that revolves, as you pick up a cast of strange characters and drive them throughout the city of Roundabout. The game goes about its goal of creating a 70's B Movie very well, with everything from acting like what you'd exepect from a 70's B Movie to VHS postprocessing effects that really add to the experience. Even little things, such as the HUD and subtitles add to the theme. The characters and story are memorable as well.My only gripes are of the story length, as I wish it could be longer due to how great everything else is, however there are many challenges and settings that add various other neat things to the gameplay (permadeath mode, limo customizations, various collectables hidden throughout the map) that add some replayablilty.A great game, I'd give it 9/10"

,Recommended,303430,19040196,"Posted: 12 November, 2015",all,somebody336,"Roundabout is a strange game in where you take control of a spinning limousine and must try to take customers to their destination without the both of you dying in a fiery explosion. That is easier said than done, as the city of Roundabout is filled with people equally as crazy as you and will happily ram into you if you don't get out of the way in time. Your limousine can never stop spinning or even change which direction you are spinning so that makes navigating anywhere trickier than you might expect. It sounds difficult and it is, however there is no way to lose a mission, if you blow up you will respawn nearby and are able to try as many times as you want. If you are a competitive gamer every mission has a leaderboard to take on, though if you are not there is only one reason to even try and that is the money multiplier. It is a system that rewards you for not crashing and at the same time causing as much mayhem as possible while collecting coins scattered about.What is interesting about Roundabout is that it’s an open world game and you are able to explore wherever you please outside of missions. There are three surprisingly large maps to explore and are filled to the brim with collectibles like hidden money stashes, car horns and “sick jump” icons that reward you for reaching them. Early on in the game you earn the ability to make your limousine jump and are encouraged to leap from rooftop to rooftop, adding a lot more fun and variety to the game. With the money you have earned you can purchase real estate around the town, allowing you to take your share of the money they make. You have to personally travel to each of your buildings to collect your share and if you don't, the money from you share doesn't stack, meaning that you have to collect your money or that business won't make you any more profit. Even though it's open world there are still obstacles that can kill you everywhere and if you die while outside of a mission you will be teleported to a nearby mechanic shop. That can lead to you trying to make your way across the city only to die and respawn from where you started until you manage to get across. With how large the maps are, some form of fast travel would have been nice.Environments are colorful and full of activity, like rabbits, fairs and pedestrians to run over Carmageddon style. There is plenty to see in the world of Roundabout from shopping malls to explore or great snowing mountains. Pedestrians scream and flee from the spinning limousine of death and make a satisfying splashing noise. There is plenty of blood and you are rewarded with cold hard cash to mow them over. If that bothers you there is an option to turn off violence and another one that makes the pedestrians scream gleeful things and giggle, which somehow makes the whole thing creepier to be honest. There are multiple other things to mess around with in the options menu like big head mode or changing the game to nighttime and it's all great fun. One minor nitpick is that you must exit your game and go into the main menu to activate or deactivate whatever options you want. It is a very cheesy and tongue in cheek game with a crazy world to suit. You can jump over planes, visit shopping malls and replay any previous missions for a shot at a better rank on the leaderboards. There are no graphic options so you may want to try the demo beforehand to make sure you can run it.Kudos for having a demo on PC, which has become far too rare on the platform. Your limousine can be customized by going to a mechanic shop with a purple wrench icon, where you are able to purchase preset color schemes and hats for your limousine. Yes those hats, this is a weird game as you are no doubt aware by now. They are rather pricey however and there is a decent amount to buy, so it will take you a while to buy all there is to purchase. Side missions are blue stars on the map that have you bouncing a soccer ball on your spinning limo, avoiding cars falling from the sky and destroying police cars chasing you. They are all great fun that also include leaderboards, though they do repeat the same ideas, only in different areas of the map. By doing certain objectives like running over a certain number of people you can earn powers for your limousine that include driving on water or shrinking your limo to fit into tighter places. This game is constantly surprising you with its insane gameplay ideas and you truly never know what to expect next.Speaking of Roundabout being an odd game, all the missions have a cheesy FMV cutscene of whatever customer you pick up in the mission. Our protagonist Georgio Manos is a mute driver that started the idea of a spinning form of transportation that really took off somehow. From children to billionaires, you will have all type of wacky customers that don't seem to mind that you run down dozens of pedestrians on your way there. The same actors are used in some situations but the tongue in cheek approach they take to that issue only serves to make it funnier. Eventually you meet a girl that is seduced by your awkward, wordless stares and becomes your love interest and the driving force of the story. It's not an interesting story by any means but it will have you laughing all the way through. The music in this game has a 70's disco vibe and while not outstanding it fits in very well to the world around it. Roundabout is a very creative Indie game in a sea of 2D platformers and RPG Maker titles. While rather on the short side if you are not into collecting everything in sight, it had me constantly thinking “wtf” and grinning like a doofus the whole way through."

Oh, it'll probably be another case of Goat Simulator where it burns out within minutes once the slender novelty has worn off. Except Roundabout isn't that, it's actually genuinely a really well designed spin-your-car-around videogame first and foremost and then there's this massive level of slick silly and polish on top of that to round it all off.It's mainly a series of mini-trials punctuated by FMV cut scenes. Drive over a star, collect a passenger, complete the trial as fast and as cleanly as possible, ranked against your friends list for the obligatory ""I WILL BEAT YOUR SCORE"" stuff. It's a joy to move around in, it's a game you can and likely will get better at but even if you don't, the game doesn't care. You have to call up the report card yourself so you can just carry on messing around and no-one will bother you. It's a simple but wonderful solution to making what could be a really ridiculous twitchy time trial game into something much more accessible.It drops the ball on the funny at times but it's all such a glorious bag of silly mess anyway, the odd joke misfire doesn't matter. Everyone seems to be genuinely enjoying themselves, it's that knowingly rubbish sort of FMV but it does have a message tucked inside it that's simultaneously obvious but also the sort of thing that videogames don't really tackle, especially in a silly mainstream-daft sort of way like this. That's appreciated, especially when you consider how games that tread this sort of silly route normally manage to either ignore these things or just plain get on the wrong side of it. It's a game with a good heart, really.So yeah, Roundabout. Actually proper enjoyable just careful with those pills."

,Not Recommended,303430,21063976,"Posted: 8 February, 2016",all,Samurai Vader,"Roundabout is something relatively new in the indie game sphere, offering crazy gameplay combined with silly FMV cutscenes. You'll take role of Georgio Manos (Kate Welch) who just got her licence to drive a limo... in a new way (because normal driving is too mainstream).Gameplay is all about driving a limo that's constantly spinning. I hope you haven't even expected some realistic play, because there isn't any - it's made to be entertaining and hard by its own way. You don't control the car from the position of the driver, you just choose the direction it should drive. That doesn't mean it's easy, it's actually pretty hard, the game will lead you to many puzzling situations where you'll have to use proper timing for all driving. To help that, you can use several skills like time slow down.While the story is linear, between mission it's all about your driving in the open world (cities). Mission selection is based on driving (well, spinning) to specific place - that usually makes you stop at many places nearby, doing side missions and challenges.What's outstanding, are the cutscenes. They are made in 70s style with a lot of silly and funny dialogues, it doesn't even take itself much seriously. And neither you will take it seriously, considering there's nothing normal in the game - all you'll do is watching great cutscenes, spinning through the checkpoints, running over people and jumping.And that's what, in the end, made me disappointed. While I love the acting and whole sillyness, after about half an hour the gameplay feels too much boring and frustrating. I'd like to see this gameplay in some other (bigger) game as a funny minigame but building around this mechanism a whole game isn't something I could appreciate.What's also a big disappointment is the length of the game. If you won't hunt for highscores and achievements, you can expect less than 3 hours of gameplay. (I haven't finished it as I asked for refund, but you can check other reviews and howlongtobeat for this piece of information.)Some people might be surprised by the hardware requirements in compare to other casual games. I haven't got much performance problems overall but there were places with bigger amount of light effects which sucked most of my FPS (and it couldn't get turned off in the settings).I understand why so many people like this game, though I haven't got the same impression. I feel like I would rather watch all those cutscenes made into a silly ""Roundabout: The Movie"" than to play it with gameplay that spins me round and round... which is not entertaining for a long time."

But damn, this game was a blast!You play as Georgio, a limo driver who invented a whole new style of driving: the constantly spinning style. While part of me assumed that it would just be frusterating to drive a spinning limo, it is suprisingly fun. Every turn where you don't crash feels like a great victory. Every time you dodge a moving car, a relief. Yet failing never felt that frusterating. With a very forgiving checkpoint system, Roundabout is able to keep you moving forward when it could of very easily just been flat out brutal. Truth be told, if you want a brutal challange, you can get it here too by trying to get high scores and completing every objective. But the only goal I had while playing was to get the passenger where they needed to go.This is because of the campy and hilarious FMV cutscenes in every mission. I will be absolutely honest and admit I played this game solely for the humor and it delivered. The acting was bad in a good way. It managed to straddle the delecite line of being bad enough to be funny, but not to go over the edge to miserable. I never cringed or felt the need to mock the actors/characters in the game but rather was constantly amused by what they had to do or say. Every actor was just so earnest in the role that they played and it sold the enitre game.

It’s like Crazy Taxi and Absolute Drift had a weird funny love child.Story:You’re a silent spinning limo driver (the limo spins not you (well technically you do too but whatever)) who picks up random people as passengers and is dragged into a story of love, racing, and murder. The plot itself could have been easily ignored in a game like this but the effort and care put into it made me actually want to finish the story. Is it great? Absolutely not. But by the end, you forget the gimmick and kinda just take the story as a story. The FMV cutscenes are a bit more… terrible? The voice acting and direction in general is absolutely awful but in a way that made me laugh instead of hate myself. They knew it was cheesy and a B movie and they owned up to it. Overall, I actually really enjoyed the characters and story.Gameplay:You’re a spinning limouzine, hit all the checkpoints, you can jump, and you can get hit like 4 times before you die and respawn at the last checkpoint. It’s a simple format but it’s done well. The challenges break up into maximum 1-2 minutes each and it’s fast enough to get you hooked but not bored. The gameplay itself is almost like a puzzle game as you figure out what series of moves would be the best for this scenario. Honestly, I never “got it” (it never clicked) but it was fun having those micro challenges and I kinda want to watch a speed runner go through it because their runs must look amazing. If you’re a completionist or like the challenge itself, you will spend a lot of time on it.There are challenges and side quests in an open world but I ignored all of them because all they get you is money to buy property that does… something? The upgrades are kinda useless too and I never actually looked for them or actively went to see them out. I’m glad too because it doesn’t over complicate things.Graphics/Performance: (with a 970, 4790K, 16GB of RAM, SSD)The game looks OK. The cutscenes are FMV and the quality is nice but compression hits hard. Don’t know if it's because of the filter though. Performance was stable though.Final Thoughts:It’s definitely a charming game and I’m glad I enjoyed it. Get it on sale for sure."

It takes the Kuru Kuru Kururin (google it) gameplay concept of guiding a rotating object (in this case a limousine) across an obstacle course within a time limit and gives this woefully underused old premise an open-world, FMV, funky, cartoonish twist. The result is about just as crazy as it sounds.The FMV video footage is deliberately cheesy and funny, and it mostly works. The basic gameplay mechanic is solid (as it always has been) and well-implemented in an open-world setting. The whole city turns into a big circus for your freaky car acrobatics! You also learn how to jump! JUMP! The game world is pretty big and sprawling, with multiple unlockable areas, minigames, collectibles and bonuses. Unfortunately the main missions can be played through faster than you can spin your car ten times, but for HC spinning afficionados there are plenty of fun bonuses to unlock to make the most of your time there.

,Recommended,303430,15436160,"Posted: 18 April, 2015",all,CaptainSpam,"So I tells you what you do:First, take a simple, yet unique gameplay element.  Like, say, a limousine that's constantly spinning.  One that, through a delicate balance of timing and control, you have to guide through a city, weaving through parked cars, buildings, boulders, and whatever else it can throw at you.Now, polish that one gameplay element.  Take it as far as it'll go.  Be creative.  Have fun with it.  Maybe there's points where spinning *backward* is the key.  Maybe you should spin over water, too.  Can the limousine jump?  Sure, but it'll be spinning the whole time.  Polish the gameplay until it shines.  A built-in speedrun mode that's solid and fun won't hurt.Then, build your game's world.  A silly, spinning-obsessed city full of pedestrians who don't quite have the right-of-way, cars that park in the most inconvenient of places, construction sites set up so a well-trained limousine driver can spin through them, and a cast of goofy characters all waiting to be chauffeured around town, not a single bit of it being taken seriously.Finally, sprinkle in actual live-action acting.  The sort where a bunch of people with actual cameras and sets filmed themselves getting into a limousine and acted out the story.  A delightfully cheesy story, no less, one about romance, weddings, civil disobedience, skeletons, murder, and tourism.  All acted out by a cast who were clearly enjoying themselves while they did it.In short, if you don't at least get a good chuckle out of Roundabout, it's possible you don't have a soul."

Okay, then. :-)This game brings a huge smile to my face, if not for the main mechanic then for the execution...The main mechanic - you're constantly spinning - is very original (okay, not unique, but close enough) and executed well. Actually traversing through the open world requires constant attention and timing, but very satisfying when done right. Along the way you get a few updates that help but won't break things. Make no mistake: this is a parkour game (and even that is mostly because it doesn't fit anything else). Don't think you're buying a racer or a sandbox or anything. It may have these elements but it's all about making your way from point A to B.Even better is the briliant decision of the developers to not only dress the concept as a revolving limo in an open world but just balls out GO with the concept and include a great deal of hilariously badly acted cutscènes. Other devs should take note: never let a good idea be hampered by it not fitting in a certain world view. Instead, set the world around the mechanic.So...a must buy. nonetheless, I have to note that the game isn't that long (though it has plenty of sidequests and hidden stuff) and barely varies from the main mechanic. So it won't occupy you for 10+ hours. But it'll entertain you in that time. :-)"

You have to carefully navigate a spinning car through tight pathways. It's challenging and despite how chaotic it looks precision is rewarded and carelessness punished. If that type of gameplay is something you're into - the weirdly charming FMV sequences will just be a bonus. I obviously am not in the mood for this sort fo game often (hence low play time) but for what it is - it's one of the best.
76561198372926237,Recommended,303430,32024182,Posted: 28 May,all,salhelder,"This is a game is just as silly as it's trailer implies, and its pretty good at that. The FMV sections are well put togheter and have the exact look and feel you'd expect. Driving around with a rotating limosine is challeging, and it never becomes too easy, since the challenges do become more complex at every couple missions. This is good for one hand because it keeps it fresh, on the other hand this game can also be infuratingly frustrating. Fortunately it allows you to retry the missions easily, however this is not without a few weird behaviours and bugs, since it appears the game doesn't really restart at the ""retry"" but remembers the damage the car had beforehand and sometimes when you respawn it will still take damage or explode, nothing massive but a tad annoying.One thing to note is that the actress playing georgio (Kate Walch) is easily the best actor in this whole ordeal, and doing so without uttering a single syllable, the other ones are hit and miss, depending on the situation, but always in an absurd short of way, which is exactly what is intended.The soundtrack is surprisingly charming and fits the tone, lots of soft funk basslines within the same style, all very catchy. In the graphics department it's perfectly servicable, colorful and nice but nothing spectacular. Fairly recommend this one if you liked the trailer.Also do play this with a controller, the keyboard will only ever be helpful in the very last misson."

Ton of fun extras too & even more fun things in the deluxe edition. Highly recommended & well worth the time.
,Recommended,303430,19203329,"Posted: 21 November, 2015",all,Souperfluous,"Roundabout ReviewA lot of spinning, not as much as in a political campaign...but still quite a bit.(This review comes 10 hours into the game having reached a 70% file completion.)Roundabout is a game that some people will not get into (or perhaps even understand), either because the FMV and sense of humour falls flat for them or because the core gameplay mechanics might prove frustrating. However for some like myself this game will represent everything there is to love about gaming.Gameplay:Georgio Manos takes on the city of Roundabout in an attempt to be not only the world's first revolving chauffeur but also its best! The core mechanic of constantly spinning seems strange and disorientating at first, but it soon becomes second nature and the thought of moving in a straight line will seem absurd. The bulk of gameplay ‘revolves’ around reaching a location by passing through checkpoints whilst avoiding damaging your limo, it is in this respect that the game is simple, anyone will be able to clear missions by taking hits and resetting their last checkpoint so in that sense reaching the end of the game is simple. However passing each mission does not complete it, each mission has several other additional objectives that require you to achieve certain goals in order to 100% them, this can be completing the mission without taking damage, achieving a certain multiplier or streak and usually two time based goals with the faster one usually requiring you to use the speed boost through some if not most of the mission making it more challenging. If you are a completist when it comes to meeting extra objectives you will get more than enough out of this game to feel frustrated each time you almost meet an objective but oh so satisfied when you finally do. There is also a collection element to the game which has you pick up stacks of cash, buy property and customizations to your limo and collect blue coins only attained through jumping which is unlocked a little ways into the game and gives a platforming aspect to the game in a couple of missions but is primarily useful for collection purposes.Story:The story of Roundabout is delivered mostly through FMV, and it is in my opinion glorious. I adore the unashamedly and purposefully bad acting and although it may not be to everyone's liking I personally love it. The FMV really facilitates setting context to each of the missions and is supported by voice over at certain points within each mission at the checkpoints which is just as funny as it is useful for telling the player what to expect. Big props have to go to Kate Welch who plays Georgio, I already had known of her from youtube as ‘shegeekshow’ and she really gives a fantastic performance especially considering her unique position as the silent protagonist and the only person who doesn’t get any lines. It would also be unjust not to mention Jillian Carol who plays Beth, Beth features the most in the game beside Georgio herself and is definitely my favorite aspect of the game, I don’t want to spoil why she is the best part of the story and the FMV in general but without her the game would not have been as wonderful as I find it to be.There is an over arching plot to the game and I honestly didn’t expect it to be as interesting as it was because it didn’t need to be nor did it have any right to be, but I found myself straying from my original method of playing each mission over and over to get 100% completion near the end so I could move on to each new mission to see how the story was going to develop and ultimately conclude. Is it a narrative worthy of an oscar? Of course not, however it wasn’t designed as such and didn’t need to be either however it has an unexpectant depth and charm which makes the experience this game offers all the more worthwhile.Other:The soundtrack is complementary to the fun and jovial nature of the game and along with the voice over within missions it prevented my initial expectation to play the game whilst listening to podcasts, it was simply too happy and enjoyable to sully my full experience that the audio provides to the game.Bonus challenges and leaderboards add even more content and enjoyability to the game, just knowing you are so close to the top 10 or 50 or 100 makes you want to play to get further up the chart even if you have already completed all the objectives, it also quickly improves how good you are at the game.Replay value - not applicable to everyone as already mentioned, but this game offers you so much more than just completing missions and moving on to the next one to see the FMV. Completionist gamers will love this game. Having spent about 8 hours in game and 2 hours just having fun messing about has only gotten me to 70% completion and I intend to make up the other 30% left to go. I also envision this being a game I come back to again and again perhaps every year or few months just to have a good time and to see how quickly I can get through everything.I purchased this game on sale and to be perfectly honest this is a game that I would gladly pay full price for, however I do feel like this game had everything catered to me and as a result I felt happy to buy the Deluxe Edition Content not only to support the game but because I had the insatiable desire to see more from this game. For others who feel less enamored with the idea of the game at face value I say this game is a must buy if it is on sale if you even remotely think you might enjoy it.Roundabout could be a perfect game for me from a subjective perspective and regardless of anyone else and their feelings for this game I will love it unendingly, however there are a couple of issues that I think would be unfair for me to overlook just because of my adoration for the game and these are:- the menu will very occasionally (3 times for me across 10 hours) became unresponsive (only seems to happen when you constantly restart the same mission in quick succession, which can help to put you in a better position to start a speedrun by having you face a direction at first to make the start faster.) The quit to menu option always still worked on the menu and going to the main menu and selecting to go back in fixed this every time.- sometimes restarting a mission that begins beside a wall or obstacle will cause you to restart and take one hit or damage straight away (it appears to be due to the position the limo starts in after being moved from your current location back to the start point) restarting a second time always fixed this problem for me and as such was not bothersome.Conclusion:I love this game, it pushes all the right buttons for me however it is not going to be to everyone’s taste. That being said I think for those who have an interest and who will ultimately get into what this game is and represents, they will have an enjoyable experience that perhaps in part can be found elsewhere but in full can only be had with Roundabout."

You take on the role of Georgio Manos a newly appointed limo driver in the city of Roundabout.It is your job to taxi the cities citizens around the city, the twist to this game is that the limo you are driving is constantly rotating and there are obstacles scattered around the city that you have to dodge around.The people you taxi each have their own wacky story and personality. Also it is one game where you will not want to skip the cutscenes. As this game is based on a 70's B movie, the cutscenes are sooo bad they are good. But this is all deliberate and it achieves what it sets out to do, make you laugh and smile all the way through.There is a range of customisable options for your limo, including different horns, paint jobs and hats! You can also gain different abilities such as slowing down time and reverse spinning your limo. Finally there are also properties that you can buy that help you pay for custom add ons.I would definitely recommend this game, its completely backward, wayward and you just don’t care. It is most enjoyable when you do not take this game seriously and its satisfying when you manoeuvre your limo through the tightest of games. Enjoy."

Explode violently because you touched a curb. Drive for 30 yards. Explode violently because you touched another car.Seriously, this game is an exercise in frustration.Okay, the story is kind of fun, told almost entirely through FMVs. Apparently the team couldn't afford any decent props so they decided to just add some film grain and turn it into a cheesy 70s pastiche. Even though, aside from a few references to Jimmy Carter and disco, it really has no effect on the game whatsoever. It's basically Kuru Kuru Kururin crossed with GTA. Navigate your spinning limo around the city delivering people from A to B, trying not to burst into a flaming wreck on the way.But you'll finish story mode in about an hour, and after that, unfortunately there isn't a whole lot to do. You can replay the individual missions and try and achieve a better score, or you can try and collect some of the hundreds of extra items within the game world. You can buy some of the 23 properties within the game world. What do they do? Well, they give you money every now and then, but you have to go back and collect it. Or you could try and find the 127 piles of cash in the game world. They...give you cash. What do you do with all the cash? You buy 'hats' and paint jobs for your limo, which make NO difference to the gameplay and are purely cosmetic. So, money is useless. You can try and find all of the 157 ""Sick jumps"", which are similar to the jumps in the GTA games. I don't think anything at all happens when you find them all besides a Steam Achievement. Or you can try and find all 49 horns. Which, again, are purely cosmetic.The story mode itself is also incredibly linear, with no branching, and almost no variety in the order missions can be completed in. So...about an hour of story mode which consists almost entirely of driving from A to B, with the occasional pedestrian killing-spree thrown in. And then there's 333 optional extras you can find. Which don't do anything useful. There's no additional vehicles or anything like that. Oh, and there's half a dozen or so minigames, most of which you'll have already done as part of main missions.The only modifications you can make are unlocked in garages as you play, and can do things like let you float/dive in water, or alter which way you spin. None of which you need for the missions.It's a nice enough game and the presentation is very well done, but there isn't really much here to do once you've finished the main game. It's really just a mini-game that's been expanded into a full-length game without reason. If there were optional missions (taxi missions, anyone?), or upgrades that radically altered the way the game works (what if, say, certain missions were only available after certain mods to your limo, like the rich guy won't get in unless it has tinted windows added), or if the collectables DID something (like the hidden packages in GTA) then there might be a reason to keep playing after the end. But, there really isn't. Except for bragging rights.It's also quite buggy...often a respawn will either drop you miles from where you were, bypassing all the closer checkpoints, or it'll respawn you partially inside a building or vehicle causing you to explode immediately. This might happen 3 or 4 times before you can regain control. I also once had my balance switch to £0.01- for absolutely no reason, and was also told that the garage was earning me money and was 23% complete....even though that's not possible in-game.It's worth playing. For about an hour. But there isn't any replay value unless you want the Steam Achievements.Oh, and the developers seem to think that taking drugs and driving under the influence is funny."

The game basically follows a limo driver whose name is Georgio (but played by a gal, awesome!) who drives around areas of Roundabout City and its outskirts picking up passengers and dropping them off at their destinations and falls in love with one of his (or her) passengers, Elizabeth (Beth is mentioned in the game)The plot does sound cliche but does use its gaming mechanics to make the game more fun and interesting, such as, that new technology makes limo cars turn round, like a roundabout, and basically you have to drive about with a turning limo, which is pretty fun but does have its flawsI died or crashed... a lot, and it made me frustrated, sometimes it could be my fault, but it can also be due to bad timing, environmental elements blocking your limo, etc... this did annoy me sometimes but there are some upgrades that can help you on the way. The game does suggest that you use a controller, but I found it just fine to play with a mouse and keyboardNow onto the fmv scenes, they are not bad, but they are not good. You can say that this game is so bad its good, but bad in a good way. Some of the actors did look like they were inexperienced and had no idea what was going on, for example, the date couple were the worst, they gave no character and looked like they were relying on each other for cues. Mike, the mechanic was also another one who gave very little character and also looked like he was relying on the script to give out his linesThe only two characters who I actually liked were Elizabeth, who although, did look like she was relying on the script but did give out some character and the quiet Georgio, who gives out his/her character brilliantly by just turning round, and looking at his/her passengers which made me giggle insideThe narrator was also good, giving out a character in his voice. The filming was mediocre and the sound editing did vary in some fmv scenes, sometimes they were okay and sometimes they were bad. I liked the addition of stock footage to replace the things the passengers were talking aboutThe game is pretty short, overall the main story is 2-3 hours long with some side missions here and thereOverall, this game is so bad its good, it has some memorable fmv scenes, and some great yet annoying gameplay, and a few characters that you will love till the end. It is highly recommended if you can take the type of games that they are so bad they are good typeRECOMMENDED :)THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY!

76561197983662248,Recommended,303430,12250025,"Posted: 26 September, 2014",all,TechieRefugee,"To start: I used to add a header to these reviews, but since it often made the review too long to submit, I've opted to leave it on my Backloggery page.Gameplay: Roundabout is one of those games that sounds like it would work best as a simple Flash game. You are tasked with driving the world's first revolving limo around town, doing things that limo drivers often do. You might also think that this concept will get old rather quickly. Fortunately, that is not the case. You see, Roundabout isn't a game that is substantiated by one single gimmick. No, this game has some pretty solid level design. In fact, it becomes a bit more of an action-puzzler as time goes on, where the game becomes more about, ""How am I gonna get around this?"" Fortunately,  you do have infinite lives, and you crash and explode after four impacts with whatever it is you've crashed into. The game does try its best to keep things in sync, but sometimes you may have to throw away a life or two just to get the game to get things back in sync.The game has a very GTA-like feel to it (by design, I would assume), and by GTA I'm talking GTA 1 and 2. It's a top-down open world kind of environment with collectables for days, so if you're a completionist, you'll have a great time with this game. 100% completion is where a lot of the gameplay time for this game will come from, as this game will only take you two to three hours to beat all the main missions. My playtime accounts for two and a half hours of doing missions plus some goofing around with the challenges. This game has nine challenges on offer which are unlocked as the game progresses, and they're for the most part pretty fun (save #9, but that's just because it's really not meant to be that enjoyable; you'll see once you unlock it).Apart from that, I really don't have many criticisms on the gameplay front for this game. It's a game that I can see myself coming back to every now and then, that's for sure. For a very solid combination of world and level design which make very interesting use of the rotational mechanic of the limo, I'll give this game an 8/10 for the gameplay.Story: The other big draw of this game is that this game makes liberal use of FMV. These are definitely some of the most enjoyable parts of the game, if you ask me. These cutscenes and the overarching story are written like an Airplane-esque satire of 70's movies and culture; absolutely chock full of references to various tropes, but knowledge of these references isn't necessary for enjoyment of the writing. While not necessarily being as great as Airplane (let's be honest; were we really expecting that?), it still offers up quite a lot of very funny moments. Overall, this game hits all the checkboxes for a 70's satire featuring manytwists and turns... *is shot*  9/10.Graphcs: There's three big things here to talk about: the acting in the FMVs, the artstyle of the game, and the game's technical capabilities. I'll start with the acting. It really does take a lot of talent to act ""badly"", and they really did pick some good bad actors for this game. Of course, given the satirical nature of this game, ""good"" acting is out the window. So yeah, they definitely had a very solid cast for this game. As for the art style, it's pretty simplistic, but it gets the job done. Everything is brightly colored, and I never really had any difficulty picking out objects in the environment throughout my playthrough. Not too terribly memorable, but again; it's good enough to do its job. As for the technical side of this game, this game was built around Unity, so depending on how well your computer can run Unity based games, your mileage may vary. As for me with my GTX 760, I never really had any problems at all throughout this game. It does startup at 720p, which is annoying for people like me who think games should just have a one-time autodetect resolution function that activates at startup, but it's easy enough to go into the options and switch things around. There really isn't all that much that you can do with the graphical fidelity of this game, but since it's not the most graphically intensive game out there, there really isn't much point complaining about that aspect. As for how the game is optimized, it ran at about 55degC on my GPU. A bit warm, but nothing terrible. Overall, there's a lot of good stuff here on the visual front. 4/5.Sound: Much like the physical acting, the voice acting is pretty ""terrible."" As a side note, I find it pretty funny that people were convinced that the villain's voice actor wasn't actually French, even though the voice actor (Psychedelic Eyeball) is French-Canadian. Anyways, the music is decidely disco-y and very slap bass heavy, much like the entirety of the mainstream 70's were. Definitely a soundtrack worth getting if you're into that sort of thing. Apart from that, there really isn't much else to talk about here. I didn't hear any really awful audio glitches, and the content that was presented was really good. 5/5.Overall scores are: 8/9/4/5; cumulative score of 8.7/10. Not too long for a main playthrough, but what's there is more than worth your money."

The graphics leave a bit to be desired (no anti-aliasing or Vsync), but gameplay is solid (that's all that matters, really) and the writing is insanely humorous.If you enjoy platform-puzzles, silly FMV cutscenes and vintage B-movies you will have a good time with this game. But despite this game being fun(ny), it is definitely an aquired taste. Roundabout is CAMP."

I can't think of a game I've had more fun with recently, and I definitely can't think of a game that made me laugh out loud more than this one... at all, really. You can see through the game itself and the deluxe content (which I highly recommend, definitely worth the extra $5) that there was just an amazing amount of care and love put into it. The difficulty is pretty much perfect: You'll explode a lot at first, but you respawn quickly enough that it doesn't get annoying at all even if it happens several times in a row. The main story is fairly short if you tend to rush through things like I do, but there's a ton of extra content to keep you busy for hours and hours afterward.Roundabout is easily one of the best games of the year for me.10/10There's some debate, but overall people find this review helpful!"
