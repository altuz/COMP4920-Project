That's more or less okay-ish if the enemies weren't that repetitive and easy to defeat. The bosses are well designed and story is surely funny, just there's not really a lot of meat on the bones of this game.It feels like Golden Axe on a budget, but that's not a bad thing at all since it feels like Golden Axe ;) The camera could be more up close to the action and the game really needs more and more challenging normal enemies, but overall it's a fun ride for the money. Maybe wait for a sale as the game is really nothing more than an hour of gameplay."

At times the difficulty is near Battletoads, which I feel is a great thing.  Challenge accepted for accepting my money Sucker Free Games.  The best thing about Dungeons is that it's 3 player.  So once I make 2 friends all of us can enjoy this epic adventure.  I'm a pretty lonely guy and most of the time I don't post reviews because I'm also very shy but I was compelled to post a review of this game.  Dungeons: The Eye of Draconus brought back childhood memories of visiting my cousins and playing Double Dragon with them.  It was one of the only times I got to play videos games with other people.  Sure I play games online with people but it's easy for people to accept you if they don't have to see you.  Rose is cool but my favorite is Gleobryn and his awesome super wicked cool chicken."

The gameplay is too simplistic even for a beat 'em up; the stages alternate between ""bland"" and ""ugly""; the voice acting is INCREDIBLY annoying; and the ""comedy"" is so dumb even fans of Friedberg and Seltzer movies will look down on it.What a terrible waste of time and money."

And lets not forget references that stopped being relevant 20 years ago- seriously, Smurfs as a communist society? That was edgy in '89. Still, not completely worthless, just not good."

,Not Recommended,303510,13935042,"Posted: 10 January, 2015",all,Terrean,"Very short game.  Would like to recommend even so, but just missed the mark.  Same moves you use in the tutorial, hit boxes for bosses are either too large or off, and no other dynamics introduced throughout the game (powerups, gear, a storyline, etc.).  Some of the humor is borderline good, but poor voiceacting brings it down.  Worth a buck if you want some of the funnier named achievements."

76561197976822079,Not Recommended,303510,26223507,"Posted: 25 October, 2016",all,Appetite4Deduction,"I've played a lot of beat-em-ups, with some of the most lax being made for OpenBOR.Sadly, this game ranks with the worst of OpenBOR in terms of combat.  Hit detection is absolute crap, and the controls take some time to figure out.  And while they aren't that complicated, they also don't feel like there is a attack-type-to-strategy ratio.  They either all work, or all don't work.You'll be spammed constantly at the very beginning of the game by enemies you can't dodge, can't block, and can't defeat all at once.  Health pickups are plentiful, with an odd choice of an alternate button for pickup (why can't it be the attack button, like every other beat-em-up ever made in the 1990s?) but never seem to appear when you need them most.What is redeemable about the game?  Graphics are pretty good, and voice acting is moderately acceptable.What is unforgivable about the game?  Cut scenes have great art but are cursed with some of the worst writing I've seen in ages.  Game tries hard to look like Golden Axe, but one can't honestly compare the gameplay.  The gameplay in this title barely functions.Oh yeah, and the kitchen boss died in such a way that the game couldn't continue (boss died offscreen).  And you CAN'T quit to the menu when this happens and start over--you have to close the whole window or use Task Manager.By the way, the game didn't recognize my controller.  All Steam games recognize my controller, but not this one, apparently."

Controls are clunky, voiceovers seem not well done, ending cuts off abruptly leading into a sequel.  Only redeeming factor was some of the comedy in it but didn't make up enough for the rest in my opinion."

,Not Recommended,303510,11696488,"Posted: 13 August, 2014",all,EpicGeekcast,I am a dad on the budget so when I review a game it is from that perspective.First off I love the art style in this game. The background is hand painted and the characters during dialog scenes are great. The in game heroes and baddies leave something to be desired but whatever.The gameplay is reminiscent of TMNT or Golden Ax as the developer says but the action is not as fluid or as engaging as those older games. Also it is obvious that this game is made for 3 players. Playing it solo is a chore and you will have to constantly continue arcade style to beat the game.The story is pretty good and the college humor is enjoyable.If you have money to waste and want a bit of a laugh then go ahead and buy this game.But if you are a budget gamer like myself then stay away. The single player experience is not enjoyable and the gameplay is not worth the money.Check out my video review herehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcFIcNR2CqQAnd subscribe to my podcast (Steam on the Cheap) on Ituneshttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/steam-on-cheap-discovering/id899847567?mt=2
