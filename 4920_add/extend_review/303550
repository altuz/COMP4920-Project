Adventures of Pip combines the best of puzzle solving, platforming and humor and wraps it all up into a gem of a game that won't break the bank and provide solid entertainment and fun.  I genuinely have nothing bad to say about Adventures of Pip, the characters are all likable and the humor in the game is a refreshing change of pace from the countless games that take themselves too seriously.  The controls are tight, game mechanics are interesting and the graphics are a great blend of pixel art and modern graphics.  I would more than recommend picking up Adventures of Pip, it makes a great addition to any gaming library!"

You play as Pip a single pixel that when defeating BitStream Creatures is able to ""evolve"" into the Hero the Kingdom needs to defeat the evil Queen and her minions.While a game that is in early access it plays VERY polished there are some tiny glitches which is common for an Early Access game. (No game breaking glitches mostly just pixels when opening certain chests and enemies sometimes popping up in weird area's including sometimes in the walls or sometimes just falling from the sky after defeating an enemy.)This game uses Controller Support and is also being made available for Playstation Xbox and Wii U in the future. Help TicToc Games by purchasing this game it is well worth the amount."

,Recommended,303550,28697497,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,Vaagur,"Adventures of Pip is a nice platformer game where you can transform between a single pixel, to a basic sprite to a more detailed sprite, each having different set of abilities. You can downgrade whenever you want to, but you need to kill bitstream monsters in order to evolve one stage higher than your current one.There's lots of timing, jumping and hidden chests and villagers all over the place. At least, you have a generous amount of heart very quick, making the game not too hard if you fall on spikes or whatever. However, lava and holes in the floor are instakills so be careful!The story is great and funny, the characters are nice... The music is fantastic too! My only downsides are that I didn't find how to change the keybinds for keyboard, so I was stuck playing with WASD controls and J for attacking, K for jumping and L for changing forms. Very odd controls.Also a little nitpick is the fact that it shows ""Press Y to ZOOM"" on the main screen and I thought it was just to see the map bigger, but it's actually the button that allows you to move between worlds without having to walk for 1 minute to get back to the shop that is still at the beggining of the game. Also, well it was probably due to my 144hz monitor, but I had some very weird bugs, kinda sinking in the floor. Lastly, well the occasional bug here and there and the clunky feeling of an old console game.But to be honest, I had a blast playing this. Some levels were a little hard, but I managed it. I think 17$ CAD is a little expensive though, as it took me a bit under 6 hours to complete the game with every single villagers found and all upgrades purchased."

,Recommended,303550,24430241,"Posted: 20 July, 2016",all,HudsonWolf,"Solid, enjoyable platformer. The main gimmick here is the ability to shift between three different forms (briefly: small square with a floaty jump, fast guy with a wall jump, big guy with a powerful sword attack) and it's executed well. Both the process of 'increasing your resolution' (by defeating a certain almost omnipresent variety of enemy) and 'decreasing your resolution' (by unleashing energy) are used to good effect as additional mechanics, and the 'weight' of each of the three forms is also relevant in certain areas (if you're lighter, you're more affected by wind, you float more in water, and can bounce higher off certain bouncy mushrooms, among a few other things). I generally found myself sticking to the 'middle' form unless there was an obstacle that required one of the other forms, but the levels are well designed such that you end up switching back and forth quite a bit to handle whatever the level throws at you.The difficulty curve is pretty reasonable - checkpoints scattered through levels and generous health upgrades help with that - though a few of the levels in the next-to-last area get a bit annoying. This is partly tied in to the only significant issue I had with the controls or mechanics: while the controls and scheme are generally smooth and well thought-out, 'corpse jumping' feels a bit imprecise and some of the later levels use it quite a bit. The plot, which generally is confined to the beginning and end of each area, is well done and clever - there are some great moments of dialogue. On the whole, it's a nice platformer with quite a bit of content, and it's definitely worth checking out."
76561198112866114,Recommended,303550,25899432,"Posted: 7 October, 2016",all,kyzka,"$15.00 are they serious???While the game is nowhere near worth that price, it is a very fun, occasionally challenging platformer to play. The story is that some evil queen has kidnapped the kingdom's princess knowing that she has the ability to create pixels from nothingness. The queen hopes to absorb this power and reverse it, turning game characters in the kingdom back to pixels. The queen further wreaks havoc on the kingdom by taking 108 of its villagers and hiding them in a variety of 5 landscapes that have been divided into 36 levels for your gaming pleasure. Like always the Evil queen lets the power get to her head and for no reason whatsoever decides that she needs to turn everyone into a pixel so that they no longer are a threat.You can relate to this dilemma as your life started off as a pixel, but thanks to the power of the princess she leads you on through apparitions and also grants you the power to absorb the energy off a certain bit stream life form so that you can transform into three different forms to aid you in your quest to rescue her.While 'pip' as a single pixel has its advantages being able to traverse narrow passages and float across wider gaps, the second form which transforms pip into a boy has even more advantages. For one thing you now have hands and with these hands you can hold onto the side of a wall and do wall jumps. You can even now punch your enemies as you hunt down that purple queen of the dark. Finally the third form transforms you into a hero which will give you a sword to crush boxes, with your greater hero strength you can move obstacle boulders and stop yourself from being swayed around in windy corridors. Each form has its pro's and con's and half the fun in the game is working that out and when you need to change from one to the other. Most often the game will test you with the need of changing while your mid-air doing a jump to your death. Sometimes you will need to change three times even in a single jump. Sometimes you will need to change back and forth quickly in order to defeat some evil nemesis the queen has brought into existence.While the game tries constantly to be funny, it never reaches that laugh out loud moment where you fall back in your chair and have to be rushed to hospital because you've split your head open. With all its grandad jokes and groan out loud puns the closest positive emotional response it will get out of a gamer is the odd smirk here and there.So why then I do I recommend this? The developers at Tic Toc games which can be found herehttp://www.tictocgames.com/have spent an awful amount of back breaking hours trying to produce a relatively stress free fun platformer, while at the same time giving the gamer a suitable challenge. The challenge all comes through the need to find the 108 hidden villagers and also thanks to the well thought out dynamics of the 3 life forms that pip can transform into and the amount of puzzles that need to be solved getting through each level to find the 'bit stream' which is the exit point of each level.In the original village there are two shops which you can use to buy weapon upgrades or health items to help you even further in your journey and make it eventually all that more stress free. For instance one upgrade makes enemies deal half damage to you. However keep in mind that when you first start you only have 3 hearts and very quickly they can be taken from you in no time what so ever.The only other complaint I have with this game is that the controls are hardly intuitive. For instance jump is 'k', punch is 'j', changing form is 'I' and ground punch is the letters 's' and 'J' being pushed at the same time. Not sure why the developers chose this keyboard set up and there is no way to change it. Often it lead me in frustration pressing the wrong button and burning my pixel bottom in an acid vat or something. This even became more frustrating when attempting the defeat the boss in World 4 level 8. I cannot stress how hard this boss was in comparison to the rest of the game and it just didn't seem to gel with all the other levels as it immediately soared the game challenging factor from fun to rather cumbersome. Trying to constantly push bricks off platforms which was lowering me too quickly into a floor of lava and at the same time changing back and forth to bring the platform back up was NOT FUN.  While you’re supposed to push three massive bricks off the main platform in order to defeat this boss I found it all TOO HARD and eventually was able to defeat him by pushing only 1 block off and using the second block by standing on it and jumping on his head two more times from that position before he dropped a third.In final a fun platformer (with the exception of 4-8) that will test your problem solving skills constantly as it takes you through 5 wonderfully different and constantly progressing landscapes accompanied by a well-fitting soundtrack which constantly tugged on my heart strings that I was participating in an enthralling adventure. I do find it ironic though that a game all about character evolution where a pixel can become a boy and then turn into a hero never really stands up in the survival of the greatest games in comparison to others that touched on the same character evolution premise with a mushroom and a fire flower.Below is a quick demo of me playing World 1-8 and defeating the boss. Not too difficult but it will give you an idea if this is a game for you when it goes on sale... Thanks for Reading.https://youtu.be/dAqLo8MqWGU"

,Recommended,303550,16951125,"Posted: 8 July, 2015",all,Obelith,"It's a game. Are we done here? No? Okay.The games entire premise is rather easy to understand. It's a sidescrolling platformer that the hero (Pip) has 3 stages of evolution. Pixel, 8bit and ""HiRez"" 16bit. Here's what you need to know.Pip can kill special colored enemies to ""evolve"" and then use that evolution in a time-stop fashion producing an AOE Attack and devolving Pip in the process.Pixel Form: Slow. Can Float by holding jump. Light Weight.8b Form: Fast Runner, Wall Jump, Wall Cling, Swimming, PunchingHiRez: Slow, Heavy, Swings a Sword, Can Push ObjectsMinor Grievances: I'm unsure if this was intentional, but you can punch Sword Blocks in 8b Form.. becaauuuuse reasons.Needless to say. I spent most of my time in the 8b form. Navigation, Ease of Evo swaps, Speed and the obvious No need for Swords ever due to the 8b oddity.With that out of the way, lets get into the gameplay. The level design of the game seems to be split into very limited segments with an evomob casually lined up for navigating how you'll proceed. It was simple. I guess it was built this way too make the experience feel ""seamless"" but in the end came out a little flat. Also, almost every secret in the game is pretty obvious with a small hole in any wall telling you ""Hey im here"". There's so many puzzle aspects to this game they could have run on and didn't. It made me feel a bit cheated. However, the Lava and Castle World were fun.I don't even want to really touch on the scripting. It was.. special.If you're familiar with Platformer games at all. There's nothing new or special here for the average gamer. I put the controller down after about 3 hours of gameplay *and* 100% Completion thinking that there was not very much in the terms of replayability or anything that would encapsulate a memorable experience.All in all. It's a game. If you've read this far and still want to buy the game - just wait for it to be on sale."

,Recommended,303550,15879043,"Posted: 17 May, 2015",all,AlgaeStuff,"Adventures of Pip is an incredibly charming platformer with an adorable story, interesting mechanics, and great music.  From the moment I saw the trailer to this game, I knew I had to play it and now after having completed it, I am not disappointed.https://youtu.be/0JY_gPzOAS0The visual presentation is wonderful and really effective; the single pixels to the 32 bit characters all have endearing qualities and help to shape this caste driven world into an effective setting for Pip's adventure.  Now, this may not be the most original game ever made but it is a throwback to the classic platform games of old, borrowing and building upon the classic mechanics that we all know and love.  I was kept enthralled throughout my entire play-through and even though some sections made me really frustrated, they were never unfair or frustrating to the point of me wanting to quit.Now that I've beat the game I look forward to going through it again and discovering all of the secrets (there are secrets everywhere) as well as find all of the villagers in each level (each level has three villagers tucked away somewhere to rescue), as well as buy any item that I never got a chance to try in my first run.I highly recommend this game to any old school platform fans or to anyone who enjoys a fun, cute game.

,Recommended,303550,22895850,"Posted: 10 May, 2016",all,MightyMuramasa,"Adventures of Pip is a 2D platformer in which you play as Pip, a single pixel who is tasked with saving his kingdom from the evil Queen DeRezzia. Armed with the ability to switch between pixel, 8 bit, and 16 bit forms, Pip must make his way through a world of peril to save the princess and restore order.At heart, the game itself has a cute and consistent art style, good music, tight controls, and an interesting premise. While all of these qualities work wonderously, the game becomes rather tedious in it's later half due to both the  primary mechanic of form switching and saving the villagers. Form switching  is presented far too quickly without much buildup, leading to a rather lackluster experience without much surprise or intrigue. While each form provides their own functions, more abilities for each or perhaps multiple ways to tackle a level would have broken things up in a more interesting way. As for the villagers, there's not much incentive to rescue them as they themselves, or any items or upgrades(in the case of the vendor and blacksmith respectively) are not required to complete the game. Furthermore, upon completing the game there aren't any objectives or bonuses aside from the ones presented in the main game(finding villagers)At the end of the day, AoP has a lot of unique ideas going for it that will hopefully be expanded upon in a possible sequel. While far from perfect, if you're a fan of pixelated platformers and  have a few hours to spare, you may very well enjoy it."

The characters are symphatetic and the dialogue isn't too uninspired.The problems I have with this game are it's length (that is how much it takes to do everything you can do) and it's difficulty level (I say this even though I died quite a lot while looking for the town's people). I hope, they try to make a more challenging and packed sequel, if they ever do.Overall, the game it's pretty good to have a distraction in case you want to play something which looks and plays just fine for a short period of time.

The main hook is that of switching Pip between three forms with distinctive features, making for interesting moments and neat little puzzles. It's quite nice how in some way or another, they are all relevant, despite one of the upgrades you can buy dimnishing quite a lot the role of the final form.Graphics are charming and the soundtrack is very fitting.

No game should ever use generic fonts such as Helvetica or Arial (and this is all over the place), and there is a serious, disturbing lack of sound for some character actions, especially bosses. For example the second boss goes through a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of transformations, is full of spikes, rolls around the screen, is all over the place and is nearly silent.

The platforming itself isn't that hard, but it can be a real challenge trying to find the villagers and reach them sometimes; somewhat casual, but still fun, it's definitely a game that I don't regret buying."

First off I would like to say this title is absolutly amazing. Everything from the graphics, sounds, music, dialog, and of course the gameplay are all fantastic. Its definitly a game for fans of the old school 2D platformers that requires precision and perfect timing. The last couple days I would often think about the characters from the game and all of the funny lines the princess and the queen would say, The game definilty makes fun of the typical tropes and runs with it.The only complaints I have would be in more checkpoints in the later stages due to the difficully spikes and I wish there was some voice acting to help envoke more humor into the game to make it even more hiliarous. But its understandable they didn't include actors just to help keep it in the same old school style.Also I would like to mention that during my 8 hour playthrough I did not encounter any bugs or glitches so just no you have no worries about that if you decide to purchase the game :)Overall I would recommend this game for anybody who loves old school platformers with charm and for gamers who want a challenge.If I was to give Adventures of Pip a rating I would give it 10/10TIC-TOC Games did a fantastic Job and I can't wait to see what other adventures Pip goes on Next!!"

,Recommended,303550,34869398,Posted: 10 September,all,"Greg, Lord of All Elements","Tl;dr: Good platformer, solid controls, solid gimmicks, gorgeous visuals, forgettable but fitting audio.Gameplay spoilers await, but no story spoilers:The Adventures of Pip is a platformer about Pip, a single pixel. His home city (probably Pixellia or something) came under attack by an evil sorceress - attacked the city, stole the princess, etc etc.Pip sets off to bring the princess home, and along the way gains abilities to increase his resolution between one of three sizes - single pixel, 8bit and 16bit. Each ability has it's own uses - single pixel can fit through small gaps and float, 8bit can run fast and wall jump, 16bit can break walls.The levels have a great learning curve, with the starter levels being very straightforward (but not boring), and the later ones introducing some very palm-sweating rooms. It never felt unfair, however.Extras include saving 3 townspeople per stage, usually hidden away behind fake walls (which, apart from a single villager, always have some kind of visual cue if you look hard enough). Replaying levels to find ones you missed is an easy affair, with most levels taking 5 minutes at most once you've run through them once.You also unlock a few shops as you play, where you can spend the pixel currency you get in each stage. I went out of my way to pick up all the currency I could find, and because of this, did not have to grind at all to buy everything from each shop. I felt the currency was incredibly well balanced.All in all, it was a very fun romp, and I'm proud to say I 100%ed the achievements - your usual faire, finishing the game, finding all the secrets. No no-death or speedrun achievements here.Very recommended."

It can be easy for the first few stages, then slowly gets harder. I was able to get 100% on my first run. It takes patience and fast reflexes. I enjoyed every moment of this game. If you haven't play this game, I would say it's worth the money."
