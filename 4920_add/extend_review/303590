Hidden in Plain Sight is the single best and most fun local co-op game I've ever played out of over 50 that I've bought and tried.I've had a room full of people cursing at each other, laughing their asses off to tears, and jumping up and down, while at other times the whole room is silent in concentration and suspense, every set of eyes dead-focused on trying not to be caught by the others' - all caused by this wonderfully simple yet strategically genius video game.GET IT!"
,Recommended,303590,11288172,"Posted: 17 July, 2014",all,sequence,"I may only have a small amount of time racked up on here, but rest assured I've sunk many hours into Hidden in Plain Sight on the Xbox 360 version, and man am I glad to see it here on Steam too. Hidden in Plain Sight is a collection of five minigames, all of which are best played with four players, right there at in the same room as you. They all insanely fun (Ninja Party is my favourite) and rely on you keeping your cool as others try to reveal and capture you, while at the same time, you're trying to capture everyone else.Ninja Party, for example, has 2-4 players all as identical ninjas, amongst 30 other identical ninjas. Each player must either be the last one standing by eliminating the other players, or by touching 5 statues scattered around the room, which play a sound each time they're touched. Do you run straight for all the statues, aiming for a quick win but putting yourself in danger of being noticed? Or do you wait for an unsuspecting player to set off the statue, and slay them from behind?This is one of the most fun, if not THE most fun local multiplayer games I've ever played, hands down. This is what multiplayer gaming was about: having fun with REAL PEOPLE, before it all became about leaderboards and strangers from halfway across the world. People that you know; friends, family, whoever. Anyone can play this game, from your pro MLG 360 noscopers to your filthy pleb casuals.And it's so refreshing to see local multiplayer games make a comeback, even if most of them are indie titles. Hidden in Plain Sight is a prime example of a simple and brilliant idea with simple and brilliant excecution. It doesn't fall prey to other indie game tropes such an annoyingly pretentious storyline or an obsession with ""unique"" and overused gimmicks.Yeah, it might not look a treat, but the graphics really, really don't matter. Same goes for the sound, as most of the time you'll be yelling anyway. The gameplay is incredibly unique, tense, and just insanely fun. It's as simple as that. If you're looking for a local multiplayer game, then buy this. At $5 it's an absolute steal. I cannot recommend it enough.4.5/5"

Graphics that perfectly serve the purpose. Definitely recommend getting this if you are ever having friends over for a multiplayer game night.

First, figure out which of the ""NPCs"" on the board is actually you.  Next, make sure nobody else does.  And finally, meet a goal.  Could be killing the other players, touching a series of statues, or running a race while the others have exactly one shot to shoot who they think is you.  Can only be played locally, 2 players, but it's tons of fun.  Highly recommend.  Just a matter of time before you see people making clones of this.  Such a simple premise, but such good gameplay."

(The character crosses the finish line before I fire)...It was me.Others: OHH, YOU ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!Games like HIPS are signalpoints that local multiplayer is dead on consoles, and *more* than alive on PCs. This is a great concept that only works when played in a single room. The amount of double-tricking in some of the more straightforward gamemodes is really fun. I didn't enjoy some of the team-based, asymmetrical modes quite as much, but I'm sure they could become more interesting once people are aware of some of the strategies involved."

This has the same customization options as on other platforms now, which I feel is a must-have addition, since I sometimes feel the need to tweak the settings the way we want to play (for example, I occasionally feel that 3 sniper shots is way too much for Catch a Thief, or I want bots to run as well in Death Race). So even if you, like me, have the previously released PC version, I would definitely recommend picking it up."

It takes about 3 minutes to understand and is a game about pure psychological mindgames.The ninja-mode comes especially recommended, as it possibly has the most tactical decisions involved.Graphics are indie and remind me of the 16-bit pixelish era, controls simple and responsive - only played with pads - music uncanny.If you ever want to play anything with one or more friends next to you and have a blast, there is no triple A-title that will come close to what this gem will deliver."

The concept of this game is awesome (similar to Thief Town... not sure which came first, but I don't care). It's a perfect game if you are just drinking and having fun with some friends over. Even watching people play this is enjoyable. The other game modes are alright, but death race is where it's at!"

76561197991681312,Recommended,303590,25626770,"Posted: 21 September, 2016",all,Zantis,"Must-Have for every Couchlover. Though half of the modes are barely any fun, the other 3 make up a very fun experience.You should play this game with some house rules, since the built-in systems do not support some mandatory stuff.I recommend the game for the following:Death Race: Extremely fun. Everyone is one of the about 20 characters on screen, the other being NPCs. You can only Press A to walk or Y to run and shoot with a crosshair on screen. First to finish wins, but if you are too obvious someone will shoot you and you are out.Houserule: sadly, the game does not give you the ability to get an extra shot if you actually killed one of your friends. So just set shots to 4, only have everybody shooting once, except they get a player kill, which gives them another one. WAY better that way.Thief Party: Fun overall. There are 2 Teams, thiefs and snipers. the thieves are one of the otherwise NPC characters on the field, about 20. There are coins, which give a sound once a thief walks over it and they disappear a random time after that. Snipers have a crosshair and 3 shots to kill the thieves. You should always play 2 rounds, switching teams on each. The thieves which collect more coins win. If the snipers waste all their shots, the thieves win automatically and a new set of round starts.Assassins: Same as thief Party basically, but the assassins kill the NPCs instead of collecting coins. Same fun though and still quite different to play out.The other gamemodes are quite awful though.Nonetheless: MUST-HAVE. Extremely fun to play. Even if you are only playing this for 20 mins on a day with your friends on your couch, it is totally worth it every time."

However, if you gather some friends, there is no other game like this one. I have played this game on Xbox 360 at friends houses for as long as its been out, and I can honestly say it was worth every penny and every minute. You will have an absolute blast playing this game. 10/10Pros:1) Amazing concept2) Perfect execution of said concept3) Doesnt require any type of high-end computer4) Party style game that almost anyone can enjoy5) Family-friendly6) Ps4 controller was plugged in and automatically worked with no problem or 3rd party download.Cons:1) Must have friends to play2) Must have a controller to play (Ps4 controller works and I believe xbox 360 controllers do, but I'm not sure about any others)All in all I HIGHLY recommend this game for anyone and everyone who enjoys party style game. Once again - 10/10(Please note I didnt put graphics in the cons section because there are clearly pictures showing exactly what the game looks like. Although I dont think good graphics would even have a place in this game)"

Don't like the statues in the mode where you have either touch all the statues or kill everyone? No problem, just disable the statues. Too many/few NPCs? Just change it. Too littel bullets or long reaload time in other modes? Again, you can change that. The gameplay is pretty hectic. I can totaly recommend this."

But it looks nice and it's cheap, so hey.By the way, this was previously a negative review, but the developer send me a very nice email making me understand how things were. Pretty cool guy. Try talking to him if you have any problem, before giving negative reviews (sorry!)."
