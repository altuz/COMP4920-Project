,Recommended,303610,35057105,Posted: 18 September,all,Skeptic,Suicide Guy is a really fun first person puzzle game that has a odd/unique story. This game is pretty decent with everything it already has but it needs more content. Once I beat the game (Which took 3 hours) I was left wanting more levels. I like the references that are in the game and also wanted more from that. This game still has some bugs to it that need to be fixed and when jumping on platforms it can be a little weird but overall this is a good game!Things I loved*Art style*level design*Trading cardsThings I disliked*How short it is*Some sound effects*occasional frame dropsOverall I give this game a 7/10

The graphic is very polished and unique,as the other games they did in this first person puzzle game,when the goal is to find a way to get killed. The environment can be very different,from trains to spaceships and it can make you think. The music is quite particular. Very recommended."

76561198123860440,Recommended,303610,34513300,Posted: 26 August,all,It'sOllie,"Suicide Guy:Suicide Guy is a FANTASTIC puzzle game in which you play as a Man who is held captive in his dreams, and the only way he can escape is by killing himself through various situations. Suicide Guy has a unique/interesting plot and storyline not like any other i've seen! The concept is new and the game is really enjoyable! Each level has a vast open area to explore and discover items which may come in handy, along with a collectable statue hidden throughout the levels makes for an exciting objective along with the main idea of ending your life. The levels get more challenging as you proceed through them and get closer to freedom. Some levels even have secrets which may be tricky to find, but keep your eye out and you may find one. The graphics are nice and animations are smooth. The graphics can be altered from Low to Ultra depending on your computers specs. I enjoyed this game SOO MUCH!Pros:+ Fantastic graphics and smooth animations.+ 25 exciting levels set in Suicide Guy's mind.+ DLC to be released.+ A funny storyline.+ Enjoyable for all ages.+ Controller support.+ Steam Trading Cards and Achievements.+ Unique ways to die, and really funny!+ Challenging levels.Cons:- Sometimes the audio is so loud compared to the rest of the game and annoying at times.- A few annoying glitches such as items clipping through the floor or dissapearing.- Random unneeded audio.- Some items feel too low textured such as the water gun and fire extinguisher.- The ending seemed a bit boring.Improvements:~ New audio for some points in the game (Waterfall, Outside wind noises :Ext)~ Collisions need to be improved for items like ""Mario"" blocks.~ More depth on the main character and backstory.Overall Rating: 9/10(PS: I really enjoyed this game :D)"

When I actually opened the game however and saw the jist of it, I knew that I was going to have fun! The gameplay on its own is very interesting and puzzle like, where you have to  really use your brains to figure out what to do and to time things properly, but there were so many things that made the gameplay better such as references to other media, varying asthetics, etc.I really suggest buying the game. At this price, its honestly a godsend"

(Puzzle game throughout)- Controllers are limited and easy to learn (plus there are a few NOT mentioned in the tutorial/guide)- Not the longest game on the planet......Seems to last forever! (25 levels)It's indie, it's funny, it's easy, it's hard....I recommend it.I really do but don't spoil the experience by watching gameplay :-)"

With well over 15 levels of fun, there will be some challenging puzzles, but most certainly solvable! This game is worth much than the $5 the publisher's are asking.

,Not Recommended,303610,34187398,Posted: 12 August,all,dave,"While the game looks nice and the concept is interesting if a little edgy, but the actual game? Its not good.The characters jumping and ledge grab mechanics feel floaty and off, making it infuriating to make precise jump and shooting over a narrow ledge you just pulled yourself up, and you will be frustrated often as too many of the puzzles rely heavily on these mechanics.The gameplay issues are pretty heart-breaking actually as the game has some charm and character. Even certain levels showed that the game has/had real potential for unique puzzles but these 2 or 3 are the rare exception out of the 23 total levels.All that being said, theres no replay value as I'd be surprised anyone could tolerate a return trip through the levels; that is if they bother finishing the game at all."

Pretty simple concept but works."
,Not Recommended,303610,34182168,Posted: 11 August,all,A_Literal_Train,"I don't know how this game has such high reviews.Honestly, I think it's because it's cheap, so kids, who don't know what quality is, can easily convince their mom and/or pop let them get this game (granted they don't say the super edgy name)Let's start with the name.It's...really dumb. Obviously this is an incredibly minor and pedantic point to bring up, but wow. I feel like that name should be a PLACEHOLDER for a better name. It's just so...dumb.Moving on.Graphics: Alright, graphically, game is very cute. I adore cartoony looks in games, and this is no exception. Very pretty, and the lighting I also enjoyed.Audio: No. It's so bad. Defeningly loud, and poorly compressed. Also the voice acting is just the same 3 grunts depending on what you're doing. Very boring in that regard. Also, the music in the ""Mario"" level is...ech. I hate music meant to emulate something, but clearly isn't that because copywrite laws. Also, there's this strange, VERY loud jingle when you load into a level.Story: Eh. It's passable. You're a fat old guy, your beer is falling because you passed out, and now you need to wake up before the bottle hits the ground. To wake up, you have to go into several ""sub-dreams"" and kill yourself. It works, and that's the minumum I ask for in a game.Gameplay: In short, Buggy, not fun, boring.In slightly longer, First person platforming isn't good. It's just not. Combine that with very finicky climbing (Hope you like bouncing on ledges you're trying to climb up!) and it's even worse.The puzzles, which I'll admit, I could only stomach through about 6, were oh so boring. Insulting even. Yes, they were early levels, but you have to engage me, or I'm not going to want to continue. I play puzzle games to be challenged, not to be pandered to.One level involved climbing to ladders so as to click on two diferent objects, then I had to climb a long, boring spiral staircase, push a button, then go back to the main room.That's it.Invigorating stuff, isn't it?Conclusion: Feels like something I'd find for free on gamejolt, that I would play for about as long as I did before getting bored with it. Only this time I feel insulted knowing I gave them money. Thank god for refund policy! Would not recomend purchasing, even on sale.Just not a fun game."

One way to wake up from an unwanted dream is ""killing yourself""... but this is no easy task, if you continue falling from one dream to another, and maybe a mysterious force is keeping you locked up in these multiple, fantasy worlds.This is the idea of Suicide Guy, basically a first person platform/graphical adventure with multiple levels, each one with a specific way to put an end to your own ""dreamlife"". Some of these are more easy to understand, but others will require all of your insight and creative thinking to grasp the ""logic"" of absurd and funny dream environments.Controls are easy and the game can be played in any language (only some written sentences in english and figures showing how to play). Best feature of the game is its narrative context, which allows for the inclusion of potentially illimited levels and environments; most of the fun for the player comes from wanting to know what kind of situation will show up next!The game has some bugs and may crash a couple of times, but this is not a huge problem for gameplay; when you have understood how to solve the main puzzle, levels are generally brief and not frustrating to replay. Anyway devs are very friendly and they are already solving most of the issues.This considered, Suicide Guy definitely deserves a try for its funny concept and creative ideas; for 25 funny dreams, the price is right. Moreover, I don't know what devs have in mind but... with such a concept, the possiblities for additional levels or DLCs are infinite....dreams are like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. ;)8/10"
