Then you work your way to better, and better fishing grounds via a dungeon. to help protect you while fishing you may purchase armor from merchants (with money you get from fishing!) or use the fish you catch to put a spell on your dog/cat to turn it into a more powerful creature to protect you from those who want to steal your fish.10/10 would fish again."

One of the best and most enjoyable games I've ever played. It was an instant buy when I saw it here again, even though I already have an official copy from WildTangent's own service.The music, the graphics, the gameplay...it's all wonderful. I can't say enough about how much I love it. Plus you get to choose various races and animal companions, including a fox! They make authentic noises and the companion really adds a tremendous amount to the game. It is generally a very accessible game, not overcomplicated, but you can get into really exciting complexity with gear, magic, and the stats that suit your play preferences.The Traitor Soul is a game I have literally played for years, and I've never grown tired of it. It's easy to pick up, play a bit, and put down...or play for hours and lose yourself in its absorbing adventures. There is literally limitless appeal and lasting gameplay value! At this price it's a steal, so please do yourself a favour and pick up FATE: The Traitor Soul today. It will be a faithful companion to you forever."

Fate is a game that I played even when I was 6 and I loved it just as much then, it's fun for young kids and older ones, if you were a fan ofthe original Fate than you'll love this one, it's Fate with even more to do."
,Recommended,303680,20477302,"Posted: 11 January, 2016",all,A Cat,"A simple game that needs (or gives) very little explanation. Think of it as Torchlight 0.5, the father of the much more well known series. It consists of a practically endless dungeon, classless freeform character building, and the ability to retire characters in order to roll their best items onto another character. The dungeons are randomly generated, as are the side quests. This means that really the only static quests you'll see are the ones to defeat ""so-and-so"" boss on ""such-and-such"" floor of Dungeon #, as well as the unspoken ones such as returning the Heroic items back to their respective Hero Statues for a reward.If you're looking for an in-depth story feel free to move along, but for those satisfied with some casual hack and slash, you're in the right place! Don't let my hours played fool you, I only just recently picked up the Steam version, I've sunk a decently sized portion of my life into the original with a boxed version, and Traitor Soul is all that and more!Overall, Fate is good for a casual dungeon crawl when you aren't in the mood for something requiring more thought. It can be paused at any time, and you can save and exit anywhere you like to continue exactly where you left off later. There are some slight targeting issues that I've noticed, but nothing significantly gamebreaking.While I wouldn't necessarily recommend it at full price due to its age, Fate's a worthy purchase when it hits sale prices for those who want to take a quick relaxing adventure into a deep and dangerous dungeon with few demands and plenty of freedom.-----Despite recent reviews, the game DOES in fact work on Windows 10, however it takes a little bit of effort on the owner's part. Fixing it up requires running the game once in order to initialize, letting it crash (yes, it will crash), then following the instructions found at Wild Tangent's support site:https://support.wildtangent.com/hc/en-us/articles/205720935-FATE-on-Windows-10with a slight correction, the game's folder you're looking for is ""FateTheTraitorSoulSteam"".The short form of this is to take the config.dat file found at the bottom of their support post and deposit it into the correct ProgramData folder (in the case of Steam's version of Traitor Soul, C:\ProgramData\WildTangent\FateTheTraitorSoulSteam\persistent). You can then open this file in notepad (or your favorite text editor) and edit the first, second, and fourth lines. These are the screen resolution and fullscreen options.What's making the game crashing is that Windows 10 doesn't like such a low resolution full screen application taking over the screen. Setting a higher resolution and/or disabling fullscreen does the trick. This fix works for ANY of the Fate games.As well, if you're into modding your game and want to add a bit more oomph (and content, such as being able to fully adventure through the first Fate's Grove), there are a couple more things you can grab.The first: Heron's Fate Fanpatch 1.0 (http://fatemods.shivtr.com/forum_threads/1590087)This adds additional content, removes some redundant things, and smooths out some bugs. Be sure you pick up the FTS 1.0 file, NOT the FUR 1.5 file. The latter is for Undiscovered Realms, which is unnecessary in this case (and the wrong game besides).The second: Heron's World of Fate 2.9 (http://fatemods.shivtr.com/forum_threads/1590084)This includes quite a bit of extra content as well as enabling some of the content found in an older, no-longer-available compilation of the first three Fate games combined. It also reorders zones and their level ranges in order to give the game a better flow as you test your fate across the various realms.Install them in that order, Fanpatch first, then World of Fate, and you'll be good to go!Keep in mind that there's no guarantee that you'll be able to import your character into Cursed King if you use these mods, but due to the nature of the 4th Fate game that may not necessarily be a negative. Fate CK is more of a sequel than an expansion and while it gives the option to import your characters from Traitor Soul, you should feel gently encouraged to start anew."

Way back when Torchlight 2 was developed I kept on hearing that it borrowed some things like pets and fishing from this series. I don't look at this game with Nostalgia glasses as I just recently discovered it and though you will want some modern conveniences brought by the newer ARPGs, this game is pretty addictive. The game does not force you to go through Acts and you could just play it your own way. The way to describe it is like how the Supernatural TV show describes purgatory ""you fight for the sake of fighting, loot for the sake of looting, play for the sake of having fun and everything felt so pure."" The game just feels so pure, pure that it only focuses on what makes these type of games fun. I really wish I stumbled upon this series when I was younger. At the price it is selling it is highly recommended.My only concern though is I don't know if its possible to access the grove main quest in this game. If only the developers would enable you to access all the main quest and all the dungeons and wrap the series up in to one neat package containing the contents from Fate, Undiscovered Realms, Traitors soul, and Cursed King."

(we played the first game in the serie.) just recently (august 3 2016) I found out that Fate was on steam I instantly bought it (no regrets at all). the nostalgia Is unreal everything from the sounds, songs, fishing, monsters,dungeon,EVERYTHING in the game is amazing.just to give you an idea of how fun and addicting this game is to me... yesterday (august 3 2016...) I had my wisdom teeths removed even though im and was in pain I spent 13 hours in the game like it was nothing :)PROS:-Fishing is extremely satisfying since you can get fishes that transform your companion into monsters of all kinds and you can get rare gear for your character.- there is alot of variety of monsters and creatures.-dungeons always get harder and more challenging the deeper you go down (also better and cooler gear obviously).- there is alot of armor and weapons, spells and skills variety that suit your playstyle.-dungeons atmosphere changes the deeper you go down so environement is never the same and never gets boring.-the game as alot of details and things that help you during your quests like magic anvils,fountains,(fate tables?)-as a RPG this game is pretty unique and has features youve never seen or experienced before and that what makes It special.-you can send your companion back to town while in the dungeon to sell all the items you stored inside is inventory (if you need more space).-if you need to get back to town while in the dungeon you can use a teleporter (blue scroll, or book).(theres way more pros but I cant think of anything else).CONS:-there is not alot of character customization but you wont really give a♥♥♥♥♥♥lol.- the quests might get repettitive for some players but I honestly think its not that bad because there is always new challenges and it gets harder (also there is still decent amount variety in quests)-when you die you are given 3 choices (so sometimes dying can♥♥♥♥♥♥you off because of that reason since you must give something to the reaper in return for your life like money,exp,fame). I personnaly always choose the 2nd choice since I prefer losing a little bit of money over exp and fame.(dying is not that bad just choose the option you prefer).TIPS: always make sure you have multiple health potions or those ""candies"" that heal you.always have one of each books (teleporter and indentify)always indentify items before selling them or using them since there values are hidden. (will be worth more or be better).etc...you defintely should try it if you have 8$ its a amazingly detailed rpg for its time and still is if you dont like it just refund but trust me its worth it.Thank you for reading my quick review, I hope you enjoy this game!-Nick :)"

,Recommended,303680,18141480,"Posted: 21 September, 2015",all,Six Degrees,"The FATE series is definitely starting to show its age now.  But if you’re a fan of classic dungeon crawlers or are interested in exploring the history of Diablo-clones, it’s well-worth checking out.Among other things, it used to be a popular Diablo-clone in its day, attracted a dedicated modding community around it for a number of years.  Plus it might especially interest fans of the Torchlight series, because the different developers behind Diablo II and FATE are also the same people who eventually got together to co-found Runic Games and made Torchlight.Not only was Torchlight directly influenced by Diablo II in that sense.  But it likewise inherited a lot of features from FATE.  Sure, you could point out that even long before FATE and Torchlight, dungeon crawlers such as Nethack had pets, too.  But FATE was really the first one to introduce pets into the gameplay in a Diablo-type game, and to give them features such as their own inventory interface, so they could carry some of your loot, and at the click of a button be sent to town to cash-it-in for you.  Plus it introduced some other new things to that gameplay too, such as being able to fish for loot at fishing holes scattered throughout the game.  That’s not to mention it also came up with how the user-interfaces look and work for all of those things.  Other than maybe give them a lick of paint and a tweak or two, Torchlight barely changed many of those things at all when it inherited them from FATE.For better or worse, FATE also influenced Torchlight’s toon-like style.  That conspicuously didn’t come from Diablo II.  And it’s a design-choice which might put off some players at first.  But it can also make FATE a perfect game with which to introduce younger players to Diablo-clones if you have kids.  That certainly proved to be the case in my household when my kid was growing up.Despite how child-friendly and lighthearted FATE might look on its surface, once you get into it, it’s also still quite an expertly made and solid Action-RPG deep-down.  In that respect it’s still a blast to play today, because that well-tuned gameplay it had beneath its surface as a Diablo-clone is still there in an ageless sort of way.You also needn't worry about having to get the whole FATE series.  The sequels mostly just add some additional content and include previous content in them.  Otherwise they essentially play and feel the same.  I happen to prefer the first FATE game a bit for my own nostalgic reasons.  But you’re good to jump into the series wherever you want.Anyway, the bottom-line is the FATE series might not be for everybody.  But I’d still heartily recommend it to any fans of classic dungeon crawlers and Diablo-clones, young or old.(Note:  This review also replaces a previous review I did for the FATE series.  It was a mixed review just to alert buyers to an issue it used to have being unable to run under Windows 10 for some users, despite trying many popular workarounds to fix that.  But as near as I can tell, it no longer has that issue.  So that means I can finally give FATE its real due with my new review here.  Not only that, but on Steam it also has more resolution-options now than it used to.  So it’s not only fixed, but it’s also improved.  That’s another real plus.)"

Yes, it can get repetitive, and yes there are some BS situations you can get yourself into, but becasue it lacks any real story you get a true dungeon crawler where your objective is not to save the princess or become the king, or even kill the devil. What you get is a game that is simple and uncomplicated.Basicly you kill things. Alot of things.I like this game becasue its simple and a nice break from bad plot writing and terrible mechanics that plague a lot of games that have come out recently, and you don't need DLC to enjoy it fully. Its just meant to be fun, and I like that."

After a system crash and a purchase of a new computer decided to go with Fate:TS on Steam.  Forgot just how much I love the game - though I do miss the mods that I had on the earlier games <grin>
