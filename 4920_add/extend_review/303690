Here's the gist, you catch fish, feed the best ones to your pet, he transforms into some type of fantasy inspired killing machine, use him to clear out your next fishing hole, repeat.Now, there is no doubt other ways to approach this game, you can run quests and completely ignore the fishing. It's almost like it's a fully realized action RPG like Diablo, with lots of weapons, armor and items to collect. Which is neat.Still, you are better served by fishing, and letting your pet take care of the action rpg aspect. He'll complete quests for you as you search for your next fishing hole, and run any of the crap that drops from the monsters back to town for you, as you get in some quality angling time!"

Change the setting ""FULLSCREEN"" from ""1"" to ""0"" and save it4. Launch Fate: The Cursed King and it should work fine nowThe only downside is that selecting the Fullscreen option crashes the gameUPDATE - Do NOT select the ""Fullscreen"" option from the settings. It will make the game crash and retrying this method wont make it work anymore.METHOD #2 - Results in a perfect fix but requires downloading some files.1. Head onto reshade.me and download the problem and save it to your desktop2. Extract it onto your desktop (or directory of your choosing)3. Open the extracted folder and double click on the Mediator.exe file4. On the left hand side, there will be a bar with the world ""Add"" next to it, click on ""Add""5.

My first ever full fledged PC game (that wasn't educationally intended) Was the original FATE. This, FATE: The Cursed King, is the last installment of the series, and I reccomend playing this one above all the other ones. This series is one of the few where it just keeps getting better by the next installment. Without changing what wasn't broken. If you've played the first, you can easily adapt to this one. While adding new elements as well, and FINALLY having no level cap, this is definately worth your time. Also, if you've played Diablo 2, you'll notice similairties with the inventories.That's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.Easily anyone can pick up and play this.You also can get Henchmen, which have three different styles you can make them think. Heal, Defensive, and Offense.Also, like yourself, you have complete control (besides moving them) of them. Spells, items, weapons, inventories...It's all grand. The amount of loot in this game is absurd, as well. Everything from the previous games are here, while also new ones and designs are added. Plus, FIVE. DIFFERENT. INFINITE. DUNGEONS.Also, I've made a guide for the game. It's really only useful if you've never played a FATE game, but It's also the only guide for the game. I've put a decent amount of effort into it- I spent my time to make a guide for this game.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=352488747Shouldn't that say enough? Doctor's orders- Toss your money at this game."

There's no real class system, which, imho works for this game so you could wind up with a decent summoner who's an expert with a sword/bow/hammer/etc.This game has a virtually limitless amount of levels (character *and* dungeon).What's good:-the price right now is a steal....I spent more money on coffee this week.-lotsa possibilites for how you play your character-AI 'teammates'-It is a diablo/roguelike type of game, and I've always liked those-Single player (see 'What's Bad' below)What's bad:-Gets a bit repetative after a while-Getting better gear means you have to either grind for the attribute level and/or gold and Fame level or use a cheat code-No multiplayer that I'm aware of (see 'What's Good' above)-The Fishing aspect is.....just....so....painfully monotonous.

,Recommended,303690,31316434,Posted: 23 April,all,Tiger Weeds,"I still remember playing the first FATE on a potato and got furstrated because the free trial ended.Recommend this game because it has probably the most immersive customisation you can have in a game. Besides, this game is very relaxing and you can progress on your own pace without restrictions.Pros:- Featuring large customisation options including: helmets, bodyarmor, belt, gloves, boots, rings, necklaces, cloaks and more.- The game got an abundent of loots like gems and relics, which you can equip it on your equipements or weapons.- Large selections of weapons and shields that divides into many different tiers and types.- A pet system and fishing system. Feed the fish to your pets and they can transform to powerful creatures.- Mercenary system where you hired NPC with random stats and equipements to fight with you, they can levelup and you can give them better equipments as well.- Fame system, higher fame access to better service.- Immersive spells options and stats system. Different stats gives you different advantages over certain situations.- Featuring many dungeons and every dungeons has hundreds of levels to explore = long playtime.Cons:- Although you encounter differnet enemies, dungeons can be repetitive.- It's furstrating to grind for money and legendary loots at high level.- Most quests are pretty boring, involving fetching certain items or killing certain bosses.Conclusion: Highly recommended, I'd give it a 8.5/10"

On one hand, it is what it is, more of the classic FATE gameplay at a very low price. I was a huge fan of Fate 1 and 2 and so I jumped at the chance to grab this. And yes, it delivered on giving me more FATE.Problem is that there really isn't any reason to play this. They haven't updated any of the spells, the graphics haven't advanced at all, the story is non-existant, movement is slow, the skills aren't interesting and even combat seems 'meh'. It all just feels old and tedious. Yeah, killing stuff and finding loot always has an alure, but there are just much better options to spend your time playing.Absolutely everything in this game was just done better in Torchlight 2. If you want to play an amazing ARPG, play that. If you just want to blow some time killing and looting and don't mind playing on an engine from 10 year ago, I suppose this isn't your worst option, just not a great one."

Not really terrible persay, but get Torchlight over this or get it on a real cheap sale if you're hard up for ARPG style games.Edit: Apparently this was a precursor to the Torchlight series.  This was not factored into the first part of the review.  This does not change my initial recommendation however.  Take advantage of the newer, sleeker, more responsive ARPG systems in newer games for a better overall feel to the movement and combat. If your nostalgia goggles can make you overlook the awkward feeling combat, god bless."

This is definitely one of my favorite childhood games, I remember bieng in third or fourth grade and me and my brother taking turns on just the demo of the game, and that time held some of the greatest moments of my childhood, and when I was in fifth grade I bought the full game disc with my own money and played that for hours a day, and now to this day I have every Fate game on disc except for this one Cursed King, so when I saw it was on steam, I bought it right away.GameplayYou start off by selecting what difficulty you want the game at and the kind of character you want to be, there are a total of 5 characters, one of them new to the series, and you can customize your looks and name, and then you can choose a pet, two pets are new to the series, and you choose your name for your pet as well. Then, the majority of what you do in the game, is accept quests from different people in town, and go out to the dungeon level, complete it, come back, and get paid. You level up and improve certain skills, you identify rare items you find, you can combine gems and weapons for powerful mixes, you can gamble your money away and hope for a great item, you can fish and cross your fingers for a lucky item, you can collect different cards and redeem them in town for extra skill points, you can find wanders in dungeons that have items for sale, you can find a statue that can give you ancient gems, you can transform your pet into a complete monster just by givin em a fish, you can learn spells that can summon mobs, throw a fireball, heal you, and so much more.This game is the greatest RPG dungeon crawler I have ever played, and topped off on all of that there is steam trading cards and achievements! For only $8 this is an amazing game, and you may consider buying the others in the set as well, as there is different monsters, and different worlds to explore.Whats the differences between previous games and this one?This game has added:-1 more character to play as-2 more pets to choose from-Keys, that unlock different sized chests and have better loot than normal chests-Allies, AI-controlled allies that will fight for you, and you can put on items on them just like you can with yourself and they have skills too, quite a big edition-More spells, not sure how many have been added, but I know the summon tesla spell is new and I remember I few others, I will update the review if I find out-1 more new fish, the tadpole I believe-Tons of more monsters-Tons of more weapons- Different achievements to earn- Different emotes, backgrounds, and trading cards to collect- And of course, I brand new world, with brand new characters in townSo is it worth getting this Fate if you have the last one? Well, there isnt a WHOLE lot added to this new Fate, but there is a few gamechanges aspects like keys and allies, I recommend this game to older Fate players if they are REALLY into Fate, and truly want to expierence all the different titles have to offer.Final Judgement: 8.5/10Fate: The Cursed King, is a great addition to all of the titles. The core gameplay might seem repetative to some, but there is so many features players can play into, like names of items, and all of the spells, and fishing, and identifying items, and Tarot cards, and so much more. If you like RPGs, or like Dungeon Crawlers, you want to pick up this game right now, its a great edition to your steam library and for only 8 bucks you might even consider picking up some of the earlier titles :)"

I loved the original Fate game, and the sequals only got better, adding more and more features until we arrived here, at The Cursed King. Probably the thing that I like most about this game as opposed to its predessessors is that you can now recruit and manage followers, whereas before you could only have yourself and your pet.

That's what potions and spells are for.Locked chests? Good luck finding a key. No, seriously. Most of the time keys don't spawn on the floor of the chest, and even if you do manage to find one, the reward isn't worth the trouble you went through.It doesn't stray too far from the realm system to be innovating in any sort of way, and the party members themselves are akin to randomly-generated and AI-controlled humans.

In time you will learn town portal and identifaction spells, sure, but that does not make the lack of item stacking any more forgivable.- There is a limited number of quick use potion slots, they too will not stack your potions.- Stamina declines rapidly when running/walking at first. You will not regain it unless you make your character stop dead and then start walking again.- Audio in general is off-putting and the BMG is really just very dull.- Item selection is made awkward by the fact that you at no point is told what the different colour codes stand for. Meaning you're left to assume which colour code is superior using the generic system of white being the worst then increasing to green, then blue, purple and so on upwards. This is not viable considering this game series appears to be targeted at newer players considering the very simple mechanics of the game.- Poor graphics. I am willing to grant that there is a certain charm in using classical graphical design styles, but the problems with them remain the same as they always were: it is difficult to really notice what is going on. Shading is poor, graphics overlap when there are enemies storming at you and all attacking you at once.  I agree that graphics does not make a game, and a game is not made bad from having bad graphics, but when so many other things are lacking in this game I am left wondering where exactly they put their effors, because it certainly was not put into improving graphics since the last FATE game.-Minimap in town is close to useless as you are expected to navigate your way thrugh the town by looking at a completely white minimap with colour coded NPCs. Yet again the colour code is not revealed to the player, so you'll have to work that out yourself as well. In dungeons you get a set of three different sizes of the minimap. One of which is far too small to navigate by, one of which is too large to navigate by, and one which you can navigate by, but you can barely see your character (a single dot on the minimap).- Although there are many items with specifically generated names making the item unique there appear so far to be very few different looks to the different items, meaning the items are not really special in any way, the developers were just kind enough to add an item name generator into the game.- Interacting with NPCs is a pain. It is slow, cumbersome and overall just insanely annoying. So is selling pet items.- You can only have four available quests at a time despite the fact that there are only four dungeouns and they could just as well be giving you all the quests for one dungeons in one go no matter what floor the quest is on. (there are several floors to each dungeon, and as far as i got it appeared there would be two-three quests per floor of a dungeon. Which is semi-practical i suppose because by then you will have fought through a hoarde of 100 monsters or so by standing still and holding the left mouse button down casting the occasional spell and picked up whatever loot is there to be had and.. your inventory should be brimming with industrial grade crap to sell to the vendor in town.It is strange to me how many people have given this game positive reviews. I can understand the nostalgic thrill of reliving youth by playing games similar to those mixed with the thrill of something new, but let's be perfectly honest, there is nothing new about this. You really don't need to compare this game to the Torchlight or Diablo franchise to realize it's a bad game all in all. That is not necessarily saying the entire franchise of FATE is, but this particular game is just.. no. Not worth it.Game mechanics are poor, so much twitching mixed with the lack of the most basic things that hack and slash games need. Bad audio and graphics mixed with predicatably generated maps and the lack of excitement in the gameplay I would expect from this kind of game. With other games with similar styles of gameplay when i had a hardcore character i sat with my heart in my throat, with this game i was almost begging common mobs to kill my character so I could stop playing as I'd decided so long as that character was alive I was going to progress in an attempt to give this game a chance. Even boss fights are uninteresting and downright dull."

When in game you can change it to fullsreen, but keep in mind you'll have to get into the config again and change fullscreen back to zero to start up the game again.For my review: Great game. I love it to bits. I had the first FATE free on my first desktop I got when I was six in 2006 and I played it so much. Now, I do not like the finicky fishing, tis a bit of a pain, and the graphics are just, bleh! But I know I have to take it with a pinch of salt as it is an older game and made by a small group.

Not only does it have fishing, but it also has a dungeon-crawler minigame inside of it! Although it may be fun, the main game takes the cake.You see, you start off with about 250 Gold, which is enough to buy a fishing rod to start the game. You can gain more in the minigame, but it's up to you as the use is mostly for the minigame, rather than the main game and cosmetics like earrings and clothes. You can also get more by selling your fish, but it isn't all that worth it due to soon to be explained reasons.Anyway, you start off with enough to buy a pole and with two fishing spots, although they are fairly similar. You also start off with a magic pet (of your choice), which is where most of the fish will be going. I say this because you can either feed him the fish or send him off with the fish to a nearby store to sell them. This is better than you doing it because due to the pet's magic, he can carry a large amount more than you and if you feed him the fish he can temporarily become something different than what you started off with. For example, if you give your pet a Bass then it becomes a Unicorn. Why? Why not! And because the joke feels like it's gone on for much too long, I'm going to end the review here and recommend this game to those die-hard dungeon crawling and fishing fans!Tl;Dr I make up a bunch of stuff about the fishing in the game being the main game and pass off the great dungeon crawling aspects for a minigame.

Being the last to occur in the FATE series it offers some gameplay improvements from the other three games as well as provides the best attempt at a story, in FATE, that I've seen to date. Albeit grindy and based almost solely on how well you can stack your stats to survive it keeps true to the series in offering three never-ending (2.1+ billion level) random gen dungeons, lots of skills to upgrade, several kinds of combat to try, many kinds of armor and weapons to use, abundant loot, a crap ton of gold and plenty of hours of fun. Overall, it gets repetitive but definitely worth it for the time you’ll find yourself sinking into the game.Extra: Seeing as I have played almost all the FATE games (except Traitor's Soul) I recommend the original FATE (2005) and FATE: The Cursed King (2011) as the story doesn't really continue between games and any improvements from the original can be fully appreciated upon playing this one. Also... it saves you some money :pAnd unlike some have claimed I've had no issues running my game in Windows 10, so maybe that's been fixed by now."

,Recommended,303690,18141483,"Posted: 21 September, 2015",all,Six Degrees,"The FATE series is definitely starting to show its age now.  But if you’re a fan of classic dungeon crawlers or are interested in exploring the history of Diablo-clones, it’s well-worth checking out.Among other things, it used to be a popular Diablo-clone in its day, attracted a dedicated modding community around it for a number of years.  Plus it might especially interest fans of the Torchlight series, because the different developers behind Diablo II and FATE are also the same people who eventually got together to co-found Runic Games and made Torchlight.Not only was Torchlight directly influenced by Diablo II in that sense.  But it likewise inherited a lot of features from FATE.  Sure, you could point out that even long before FATE and Torchlight, dungeon crawlers such as Nethack had pets, too.  But FATE was really the first one to introduce pets into the gameplay in a Diablo-type game, and to give them features such as their own inventory interface, so they could carry some of your loot, and at the click of a button be sent to town to cash-it-in for you.  Plus it introduced some other new things to that gameplay too, such as being able to fish for loot at fishing holes scattered throughout the game.  That’s not to mention it also came up with how the user-interfaces look and work for all of those things.  Other than maybe give them a lick of paint and a tweak or two, Torchlight barely changed many of those things at all when it inherited them from FATE.For better or worse, FATE also influenced Torchlight’s toon-like style.  That conspicuously didn’t come from Diablo II.  And it’s a design-choice which might put off some players at first.  But it can also make FATE a perfect game with which to introduce younger players to Diablo-clones if you have kids.  That certainly proved to be the case in my household when my kid was growing up.Despite how child-friendly and lighthearted FATE might look on its surface, once you get into it, it’s also still quite an expertly made and solid Action-RPG deep-down.  In that respect it’s still a blast to play today, because that well-tuned gameplay it had beneath its surface as a Diablo-clone is still there in an ageless sort of way.You also needn't worry about having to get the whole FATE series.  The sequels mostly just add some additional content and include previous content in them.  Otherwise they essentially play and feel the same.  I happen to prefer the first FATE game a bit for my own nostalgic reasons.  But you’re good to jump into the series wherever you want.Anyway, the bottom-line is the FATE series might not be for everybody.  But I’d still heartily recommend it to any fans of classic dungeon crawlers and Diablo-clones, young or old.(Note:  This review also replaces a previous review I did for the FATE series.  It was a mixed review just to alert buyers to an issue it used to have being unable to run under Windows 10 for some users, despite trying many popular workarounds to fix that.  But as near as I can tell, it no longer has that issue.  So that means I can finally give FATE its real due with my new review here.  Not only that, but on Steam it also has more resolution-options now than it used to.  So it’s not only fixed, but it’s also improved.  That’s another real plus.)"

But the others I enjoyed just as much if not more. Anyways, onto the review.I love how the kept the same feel and didn't upgrade the graphics that much or not at all. Brings back the feel for the previous FATE games.The combat seems a bit more difficult (at least to me) and for good reason. With the introduction of AI companions is quite the bold move to make. It feels flawed. But not impossible to take advantage of.Ok, so to the companions. for the first 10 levels their price is around 8000 gold to 30000 gold. After that it's much more expensive. Their skills and stats aren't as good as the main character clearly. And their spear, sword, crit, etc skills. They didn't put skill points into specific skills. Kinda all over the place. And their stats can't be changed or can you level them from level one like some companion based games i've played. But I enjoy it none the less.Pet stuff the same... New items, new spells, and a new potion/charm of revival for your companions. And I think there's multiplayer stuff (haven't gotten to that yet). Enemies seem tougher now. Either that or my gear is crap lol.The amount of enemies in one area has changed a lot too. Seems like it was doubled. But it's no problem for spellcasters or strong melee weapon users (AKA power attacks). The new weapons are very cool too. New swords, axes, and so on.Very simplistic game with graphics of a potato Mark3. But a very enjoyable classic series.The only thing I wish this game had was some awesome music.But despite that, I'd give this a 8.5/10. Hours of fun. Hours of farming. Hours worth of enchanting BS."
