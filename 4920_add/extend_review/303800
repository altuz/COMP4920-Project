Which for a board game that's pretty good.+ good music.+ the AI is not faceroll easy, but also doesn't cheat+ I didn't feel like I didn't have control. You do feel like you have choices and that your choices matter. The game doesn't play itself for you.+ the ability to play against other real life people :)- would like the ability to skip AI's turns. The AI in comparrison to other games is quite quick, but if you're playing a 5 quest match with 3 AI opponents it drags out.Enjoying the game and would recommend it to anyone that likes board games :)"
76561198080789761,Recommended,303800,13179986,"Posted: 1 December, 2014",all,Yellow Horror,"This is a good realization of the board game. It is playable as hot-seat or online and may give you many hours of enjoyable experience.But there are some flaws that need to be fixed to make the game perfect:1. When a player have to do a choice, he/she can't access to the game map and/or any player hero sheet and resources including his/her own. This may easily lead to wrong decisions and waste fun. The board game is obviously free from this limitation. So, the possibility to ""minimize"" the choice and take look at the game state will make the game much comfortable.2. Some choices are not clearly described. For example, Triss Merigold has a spell to look at the two top investigation cards then put one on the bottom of the deck and the other back on top. When this spell is used, the game show two cards and say to the player just ""choose one of them"". What will be happen next with the chosen card is unclear.3. The rules of the game says that proofs can't be exchanged back to leads. So, the investigation successes of a hero converted to proofs must me ""protected"" from any bad events that force the hero to spend leads. But in the computer version proofs ARE exchanged back to leads every time a hero must spend more leads than he/she have.4. The AI is wery weak, so the single-player games are dull and not enjoyable at all.5. There is no russian language, sadly to many and many russian-speaking Witcher fans.6. In network games, when a player quits at the characters selecting stage, all other players are forced to quit and try to start network game again. That allows one player to abuse many other.7. Triss ""Teleport"" spell is mightly overpowered. It allows Triss to collect two leads in a turn without any risk. I think, this is not the board game disbalance but the wrong implementation in computer game. Some other abilities with the text ""when you perform [stated action] {do something in addition}"" also work weird in the computer game."

Developers stopped supporting it when all it needs is couple of little updates.No public online. But that's alright, you can always play with your friends.No reconnect.

If you were interested in getting the physical board game, as I was, I would definitely recommend this as it could save you $60 if you decide that it's not for you.  Another condition is to have friends you could play this with if you don't plan on getting the physical game.  If you do not meet either of these conditions, then this game gets a little hard to recommend at the moment.  The AI is fairly stupid which, for the first game or 2, is fine.  But after 1 game for me, I was able to face-roll the AI.  I think I won by almost 45 victory points.  It's always possible that the devs could improve the AI.  But as of right now, that's where other people would come in to play.  Ultimately, this game was fun enough to convinced me to buy the physical game, but I can't imagine playing too many more games against the AI."
76561198013723081,Recommended,303800,31573066,Posted: 5 May,all,RPG Gamer Man,"A game reminiscent of Mario Party with board game mechanics.A board game themed witcher game, which features characters from the witcher series in the game. Basically, it plays like a board game on the pc. If you ever played any of the Mario Party games, this game is similiar. Each player takes good or bad card hits on their turn and can move spaces or do certain actions on each turn. Note that it seems that negative cards usually are more in the game then positive cards, but that what makes it interesting, what you do with the negative effects and play a round with them. Anyways, here is my pro/con list as usual:PROs:`Featuring characters in the Witcher series`Board game mechanics`Interesting playing cards randomized to give good or bad fates`Quests that you need to do`Online Multiplayer`Local Co-op up to 4 playersCONs:`Repitition. Every turn, you do something, kill a monster (or fail), and then end turn. Every turn is similiar.`Getting killed by same monster every turn can happen to you, thus making you fail the gameMY final thoughts: If your a fan of the witcher series, i recommend it. Also, there is multiplayer online play. Other than that, this game can become repitive if you play it too much. Be careful of that."

I was bored after a few games. But maybe it's just me.- Only 4 characters and one of them is Yarpen :(Overall rating: 6/10. Nothing special. Good enough to buy with a discount.

The singleplayer AI is absolutely horrible so offline mode isn't any fun after you learn the game.Online is horribly unbalanced due to Triss being able to teleport around acquiring 2 leads per turn compared to the other characters 1, thus completing the quests 2x as fast as the other characters. Every 3 game match I get into with a halfway decent triss player completes the third quest in 14-20 turns while everyone else is finsihing their first or getting onto their second. This would be an easy fix to simply allow the teleport card to be used before travel only or limit only 1 lead from travelling per turn.Its also quite annoying how you can't directly hinder an opponent, You might draw a card randomly by chance to slightly hinder them but it's nothing significant and will likely hurt you just as much.Other than the balance and horrible AI it is a pretty fun game though"

You have four playable characters, each with own strong and weak points. And you've got some quests to do, by travelling in the dangerous world, fighting and tricking monsters and politicians, helping and betraying other good guys around, to make a better final score for yourself.Surely, card game is looking better when you have 3 pals around, free evening and cozy place to gather. And maybe pizza to fill the list... But! Funny thing is that this Adventuring Witcher game is more suitable to the PC, than to such gatherings as a gaming party of good friends. It's a bit more on the digits side, than I'd really loved to see in my basement (or garage), when I meet my people.On the other hand, for the multiplayer little session, game feels quite alright: fast, challenging... If only a bit too cold, though, during a little amount of real interactions between players. Still, for its current price, this game is must-have - if you ever were about turn-based games where you gotta think and calculate your steps miles ahead.My mark is 8/10. Not the thing I'd take with me on the space flight to Alpha Centauri... But quite fine as a card game, a gem among many others there on Steam.

The price is right.TLDR: The game isn't terrible but also isn't great.  There's no meaningful interaction between the various players.  Constant status ailments can become frustrating.  3/5 stars.My negative review is of the game itself.  It's a simple four-player ""collect various resources until you have the right combination to cash them in for victory points"" type of game, coupled with basic dice-based combat (versus the environment, not versus the other players).  The main problem I have with this game is that there really isn't any interaction between the different players.  For example, I might draw a card that affects all of the players, but it happens automatically, whether I want it to or not.  At no time in the game was I able to choose to influence the other players in any way, either to help them or to hurt them.  So basically it boiled down to four players, each playing a single player game on the same board.  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't very enjoyable either.  I originally bought the game in the hopes that multiplayer would be fun, but considering the lack of meaningful interaction, it kind of seems pointless now.And this game is dark.  You will be negatively afflicted with status ailments every freaking turn.  Because of this, the game becomes a long, grim slog to complete your quests.  This is all very true to the witcher universe, I just don't know that it lends itself toward making a game fun.On the plus side, the artwork is fantastic.  Having read the various Witcher stories and played the excellent RPGs allowed me to appreciate the lore that is depicted in this game."

76561198037882690,Recommended,303800,13135100,"Posted: 28 November, 2014",all,Mr.hulk,"This is a simple but suprisingly entertaining game, made for fans of the Witcher series and who also enjoy casual board games.I'll start off by saying this: don't expect too much from this game; the system has been developed competently enough so that it offers more than an average amount of replayability, with gameplay duration lasting somewhere between 70-120mins depending on how many main quests are necessary to win the game - the number of quests to determine the victor can be chosen at the beginning of the game. However, if you are expecting the next X-Wing or Arkham Horror, you'd better look elsewhere. But if you can put such hype aside and play it for what it is: a decent board game that, if played with friends either online with this digital version, or face-to-face with the physical copy (the way I believe all board game SHOULD be played if you're able to do so) is worth your consideration.The Witcher Adventure Game is, in certain aspects, similar to Arkham Horror and Talisman - in fact to me it feels somewhat like a mish-mash of the two. Is it as good as Arkham Horror? In my opinion, no; Is it better than Talisman - if judging Talisman without all the expansions and basing the comparison simply on the base game itself - yes, to me at least it made for a more enjoyable experience, both online and face-to-face with the physical copy.In terms of gameplay; it's kind of a mish-mash of Arkham Horror and Talisman, so, like I said, this game has a level of spontaneity, with random spikes of difficulty throughout the game - but it makes for an interesting story as you're playing. Taking into consideration all the different events (foul events and good fortune), monsters (leveled as bronze - easy, silver - medium, and gold - hard) and the war track, it really isn't suprising how you might find yourself at the bottom of the pack if hit with too many unlucky cards a few turns in a row; but if you play it smart you generally defy the odds and hold out for these few 'bad' turns and bring yourself back into contention for first place.The characters are pretty well balanced. Having played with all but Triss, I've yet to find anything overpowering or game-breaking with any of the four playable characters. Each have their own pros and cons - not that I'll spoil their abilities; learning the playstyle of each character for the first time was half the fun!Last but now least, the artwork is pretty topnotch - and it should be, considering CDPR and FFG have sourced most of their material from the concepts done for the three witcher games.Overall I reckon it's worth a grab for witcher fans who also enjoy BOARD GAMES. This isn't a hard game to wrap your head around; you can learn the system within the first 10minutes; but it is enjoyable, and that, at least for me, makes it worth the buy."

Nevertheless I still recommend this game, especially since disconnection problems were fixed. AI is still far from brilliant, but it is really much fun to play with friends.

Feels a bit like solitaire.The game is consistently harsh on how it punishes the player, and at times it can be a downer. The reality is you feel less like you're making choices to progress and more like you're making choices to mitigate misfortune.Conclusion: Buy on sale."

There's no way to resume a multiplayer session if one of the player dropped out of the game due to various connection issue. That is a huuge problem for me and my friends because without this feature we just can't see a way to finish a single session since the standard game takes quite some time to finish let alone the epic game.Despite my love of the franchise, and me being a fan of FFG boardgame in general, I have to give the digital version of Witcher the Adventure Game a thumbs down.

There's good music, there's a nice atmosphere, the encounters are cool and the interaction is nearly well excecuted. It's a very well thought out board game, with minor flaws and weird 'fast travel' systems that just robs you of your money.With nearly well, I mean that the AI is A) dumb as hell, B) cheats.As for the dumbness - the AI tends to just spend all their development cards for 1 fight, while s/he should only need 1. Then there's the endless 'fast travelling' that they're doing and making things harder for themselves.Then there's the fact that they simply refuse to complete their main quest. Dandelion for example, had 6 purple proof items and kept spending gold on 1 more every time he could, while avoiding the main quest area.This didn't happen once or twice, this happens nearly every game I'm playing.As for the cheating, I'm convinced that they don't cheat with the dice rolls, but there are cards like Dijkstra's thugs, that makes you have to cash in 2 investigation tokens. Or, if they lose a fight, to hand over 1 or 2 tokens. The AI doesn't have to do this for some unexplained reason. I've also seen instances where they become 'delayed' and still perform 2 actions, while not having a good fortune card to ignore the delay.All in all, it's not a masterpiece, but deffinatly worth spending 1 hour per day for a round of fun and the price tag isn't too bad either.Here's to hoping that the patch removes these weird AI issues.****************I'm going to ADD to this review, rather than edit it with strikethrough.A new patch came out recently and fixed every single bit of gripes I had with this game. Now it's a challenge, the AI doesn't cheat with Dijkstra's Thugs, they don't derp around for an eternity and makes this game a HUGE challenge.Thanks CDRP, for listening to your customers!"

The big problem is, the AI is so bad that the only interesting purpose of this game is to play it with friends or online. Got no friends having it (check), and it's taking a hell of a long time to find a match, but it's not really surprising, people wanting the Witcher universe will be playing the Witcher 3.It deserves a shot thought, if you can catch it before summer sales are over, but i will recommend it for fans of the franchise like me, or players of this kind of games.

The game's replay value is very high, and is a lot of fun to play with friends both locally and online. This game is very easy to learn, and introducing someone to the game is very quick, as short instructional videos are included in the game itself. If watching videos to learn isn't much your fancy, the game can be learned fairly easily through gameplay. The game successfully captures the darkness and the bad-to-worse story development of the Witcher literature and games, making the experience familiar and fulfilling to those familiar to the franchise while also fun to those who are not so familiar with the Witcher world. It also includes a feature allowing players to vary the length of the game by changing the number of requirements to be filled in order to achieve victory, making the game last anywhere between a twenty minute spree to a night-long affair depending upon what is desired.There are occasional bugs that crop up, such as results from dice rolls momentarily disappearing from the screen or development cards not glowing when they are usable, but such glitches are so few and far between that they do not hinder the experience much. The only other complaint worth mentioning about the game is that, to some, the experience may grow repetitive after successive playthroughs, as the gameplay is much the same from game to game. As such, many tend to take breaks in between playthroughs.I would rate this game an 8.5/10 for its fulfilling play yet repetitive nature."

This is an unfair review as I am slightly partial to CD Projekt Red's Witcher series. There are some flaws with the game design, such as multiplayer solitaire. I tried using Triss Merigold and she seemed fine. However, after playing multiple games, I've decided to vote it down, mainly due to the insane random events from dice rolling and card drawing.PROS1. Follows the Witcher SeriesVery accurate, all the main characters are inside. I was actually looking forward to using the Scoia'tael (Elves), Philippa Eilhart (Mage ♥♥♥♥♥) or Saskia (Dragoness) in the game.2. IntuitiveIt's easy to learn. I didn't play a single tutorial to be able to understand the game.CONS1. Multiplayer Solitaire *****You don't really care about any other player as none of actions matter to you. There is hardly any player interaction.2. Advanced Snakes and Ladders *****It is just personal racing like advanced Snakes and Ladders. You just roll dice and play the game on your own.3. Random Monsters and CombatThis is so boring. The random monster generation doesn't capture the fantastic monsters that I experienced playing the Witcher 2. To defeat SINGLE monsters, you roll Swords and Shields. If you roll a sufficient amount of Swords, you kill the monster. If you roll a sufficient amount of Shields, you block its negative effect.It lacks the skilled planning and excitement that the normal Witcher game brings since it all boils down to Sword and Shield.4. Random Bad Fortune and Investigation CardsSome just make you lose 2 VP just for drawing them and some just do nothing. The randomness is horrendous. The investigation cards are also full of negative cards called Setbacks which have no redeeming value. If you draw badly, you are screwed.SUGGESTIONS1. TrapsIf you arrive in a location, you can play a card that leaves a surprise for the next player who crosses (not land) its path. It might be a nasty surprise or a simple challenge. That way players will look at where other players are moving to.2. Learning Other Player's AbilitiesCurrently, each player has their own unique development deck. No one will care about what another player develops.Based on the abolve design, one deck will likely be superior to the others. It would be interesting to take 2-3 developments that belong to other players as your own. This could create crazy combos and make player's more interested in what the others are doing.3. Global QuestsThis will give something that everyone will fight over for VP. E.g. Save Ciri. Pay 3 Blue Leads, 3 Purple Leads and 3 Red Leads for 12 VP. Only completable once."

It's challenging.And in all, a great game if you're into boardgames.Multiplayer both online and as hotseat.Cons:Needs a proper tutorial - even though there are short videos to explain the basics, it doesn't cover everything, which eventually will send you to the rules section for tedious reading.And even those rules are taken directly from the hardcopy boardgame, with instructions to place your playing piece on the side, and stuff like that.You'll pick it up as you play, but a proper tutorial would have been better.Needs more cards, especially for battle encounters.Playing a 4 player game with a 5 quest goal, with have you battling the same few handfuls of monsters over and over.And quests are pretty much all the same - strip the description and you're down to 'collect X tokens of type Y' and go to place Z.Game mechanics are a bit shoddy.You can pretty much spend the first ten turns drawing development cards to OP your character.And often rewards  are penalties to the leading player, which kinda blows if you pick a reward that actually penalizes you.Character balance is off, with Geralt with a severe lead on the others, by having 2 more dice to roll for combat encounters.Yeah, the others have other advantages, but bashing monsters is a good way to rack up victory points, which makes a free skill for Triss to run away without penalty kinda bleak and useless in comparison.In a long game, I don't see how you can lose with Geralt.Conclusion:It's decent enough to recommend, but wouldn't say it's worth the full asking price of 10€.Picked it up on a deal for 6€, which I think is a more appropriate pricerange, all considered.You will have a good few hours of fun with it, but I'm imagining it gets kind of pointless once you've played all the characters and handful of times, simply because the character balance is totally off, the game mechanics have obvious exploits and are somewhat poorly designed, and it lacks diversity and content for longer games.But that's just my opinion. I'm a boardgame geek, and I have been designing games since I was a 10 year old kid back in the 80's, so I spot the flaws immediately.You could end up having a fantastic time with this game, regardless of what I think."

I mean, I loved Talisman... and this looks even cooler! Sadly, no. This game PRETENDS to have three equal mechanics to it (diplomacy, magic, and combat) but the only thing that really matters is combat. Game ends when any player completes a pre-set number of quests, but the person who finishes the most quests isn't the winner -- the winner is the person with the most victory points. What's the most reliable way of making victory points you ask? Why in combat of course! Every turn there is likely to be a combat, and many of the combats give VP... because of this, it is possible for the combat characters (really just Geralt, because he's the best fighter) to lap all adversaries on VP even if he doesn't come CLOSE to finishing as many quests. This game is like going to a dance contest and realizing you're also going to be judged on your attire, which is okay I guess BUT WAIT... you're ALSO going to be judged on a juggling routine... and somebody else is an expert juggler.

Basically, you are never playing against the other players, but against the extremely punishing and crippling gameplay, which puts you in front of challenges you simply cannot win (e.g. fighting an enemy that requires five dice and you only have four) just to slow you down.In addition, the atmosphere is as removed fom the Witcher games and books as possible; obviously, since the characters are only pawns, they simply have the name and face of the characters we know, but also the missions and ""episodes"" you stumble upon are extremely linear, basic and poor in details.I honestly cannot recommend it, unless you are a total fan of challenging boardgames."

First full game I completed, I won with a score of 64 to the AIs 21 and 2. I'd never played this board game before, so had no particular strategic approach to it (beyond the basics), so to me this is a sign of bad AI, the huge gap between my ability and theirs.Additionally, the character balance seems off. I'll probably play the game a bit more as other characters to see, but for now it seems as though the strengths of Geralt far outweigh those of any other character.So while it's a no to recommend this game, it's not an outright no... it's more a 'be aware' of what you are getting.

I like long adventure board games (such as Runebound and World Of Warcraft the Boardgame) and this was just kind of boring. Half way through the game I was just wanting the game to end and when it finally did end all I did was look to the ceiling and sigh heavily saying, ""finally!"".Some issues I specifically had:-Tutorial, it has you watch the first tutorial and that is all it tells you, next thing the game asks is if you want to play offline or online. Turns out there is like a dozen more tutorial videos in the main screen's menu though I didn't know that as it doesn't really make it easy to know.--At least the rule book you can access in game isn't that bad.-You can't tell what is going on in opponents turn. AI opponents take their turn really quickly with cards and effects happening all over the place but it still takes the 3 of them at least a minute to get through their turns, So the game might as well be single player game with 1-2 minute lag between turns because that is what it amounted to. What the opponents were doing didn't really matter other than the automated ""bad stuff"" that happens to you on the beginning of your turn from their Foul Fates and you don't have to pay attention for any--The activity log always being up on their turns would help, the monster that an opponent is fighting always being up on the left side of the battle screens would help too to know what is going on and what just happened to them. Especially on the battle results screen so I don't have to specifically try and remember what his negative effects for losing were.-SO MUCH bad stuff happening to you every turn, feels like you have no control over it because so much happens every turn.--It actually got to a point in my game where I had something like 10 turns where I was stuck unable to do anything but rest every turn from all the bad stuff I was suffering every single turn. Foul fates laying down more foul fates, wounds, deadly wounds. Foul fates from other players constantly. Monsters that have bad effects from just fighting them (more foul fates and wounds). More monsters spawning. On and on and on.-----90% of every turn was dealing with bad stuff happening from foul fates or other player's foul fates.-A few little glitchy spots where music cut out for a few minutes and sometimes the game wouldn't detect I had something I could do, had to restart the game once since it literally wouldn't let me take an action. And several times where I had a witcher sign but the game didn't think so then all of a sudden 30 seconds later it would say ""oh, you do have one, ok you can use it now"".-AI are really dumb at times, I'd see them use a spell/card that gives them more defense dice...then not use the dice and somehow fail the combat's defence section. Rather often too. I won my game but it took over 2 hours for a game that the main screen said should be 45 minutes, some of that may have been me not knowing how to best play but man is that a difference.Wouldn't recommend the game. Maybe I just had a really bad first game but it certainly wasn't no 45 minutes long 3-quest game. Second half of the game really felt like it was dragging on. And the game didn't feel much like an adventure game, you don't really power up your characer other than from development cards and those you can just get every turn without doing anything (literally the only way to get them is using an action to draw 2 keep 1), no gear from quests or looting monsters, no new powers really from leveling up type of stuff. Just spam development cards to get what powers you want then move around trying to collect a dozen investigation tokens of certain colors and hope the piles of bad stuff happening to you ever turn doesn't hinder you tooo much.And hey, I only played a single-player vs 3 AI game, maybe when playing multiplayer with actual other people it will get better. Though I worry about downtimes greatly increasing in that case."

As a result of the dying/dead online community, i'm going to change the review to a not reccomend. It's still a fun board game and you CAN local co-op the game but is the solo experience worth 10 bucks? I'd say no when there are other options. I also looked at the steam charts and while the player-base has risen to 200 players, i'm still having trouble finding games. If you have friends to play with, this game may be worth the money. otherwise i advise saving the money for something else.so i just played a match against the AI as Triss and here's my detailed-revew-after-1-game for those of you that have that feeling that you just can't wait to play the game but are worried about the game being some sort of con.TL:DRThis is a fun board game and anyone that likes board games should probably pick this up and support it.The actual explaination of the game in my experience during 1 round, since the info given is kinda bare-bonesThis board game involves you playing as 1 of four characters and completing various objectives on a quest card to score points. The objectives often are either:1. go to some area and spend resources to get points2. Just go to some area and you get points3. just spend resources and get points4. go to another person and spend resources to assist them with THEIR quest and get points while they get half as many pointsIt's simple enough but what makes it difficult is the board itself and two kinds of setbacks.the first setback is drawing a misfortune card. There are 3 ways to get misfortune cards.1. An effect of another card/monster2. fast travel (moveing 2 spaces for the price of 1!!!)3, move to a space and be forced to draw a misfortune card.The misfortune cards have various effects from getting hurt, monsters and bad guys spontaneously spawning out of your rear to paying some sort of toll or even choosing between the last two options as I never really encountered the first with either of the other two.The second setback is monster cards. Monster cards are ranked from bronze, to silver, to gold, each with increasing lethality each time. Monster cards can have various, previously mentioned effects as well, but they mostly just injure you. When you're injured you're incapable of using the action that's injured until it's healed. Some cards can heal you or you can heal yourself for the cost of one of your 2 actions. some monsters can make a quest much harder to deal with, with an example being a troll that kicked the AI's butt and I conciously avoided until i got strong enough to deal with it. You fight monsters by rolling a hero die, and a number of regular dice. the hero die tends to resonate with your development cards (next paragraph) while the regular dice have either a defense, an attack, or a blank face. meet the required amount of attacks or defenses and you succeed in either attacking or defending. attacking a monster successfully takes it off the board and can possibly yeild rewards while defending averts a bad effect from taking place. Monsters need to be killed in a single roll, their damage does not stay on between turns.Speaking of getting stronger, you do so by drawing development cards. Development cards have various effects as well, in my case they alll had to do with rolling a hero die just right during combat, (i didn't encounter any development cards that ouright added the number of dice i roll or anything). you can choose, for an action, to draw 2 development cards and keep 1. Some development cards are much stronger than others and their effects seem to vary, (though as triss i only drew development cards that aided me in combat, which was lucky for me in this case, but each character has their own development cards by my understanding, though i think other characters CAN use other character's development cards. I'll edit this later if i'm wrong). Development cards need to be charged before they can be used and you can put a charge on a development card by using an action to charge it.You cannot use the same action twice on one turn.Finally i'll touch on resource gathering. you gather things called clues which come in the colors of blue, purple, and red. you get clues by either:1. moving to an area and drawing 1 clue of one of the colors on the area2. investigating for an action and drawin 1 clue of 1 of the three colors3. getting cards which boost the number of clues you get. These cards tend to happen when drawing clues and can sometimes have negative effects but often have traits which resonnate with other traits and get you lots of clues in 1 go, if you're lucky enough.There's also some war tick thing that never came into play when i used it either that or i didn't notice its effect... sooo i guess i'm lucky.I don't think i missed anything, so i'll now move on to the impression the game gave me.I enjoyed the game. somewhere along the line the whole thing started feeling very natural to me and i started making strategic decisions on where to go, which rout i should take to get to a destination, and what actions i can afford to spare preparing myself for what's to come and which actions i needed to use to collect resources or get the hell out of rivia (where the freaking harpy just landed!) Overall it's a very fun game and if you're a fan of board games i think you should get it. it's only about a day old so i haven't found a multiplayer match yet but I dabbled in the multiplayer options and i found a small chatbox on the top left of the screen, which is vital for games like this where playing the player can be just as important as playing the game.The downside to this game that i can see so far is that the tutorial consists of a bunch of videos as opposed to a hands-on experience, so that may make it just a little annoying for some people to get into it but i found that once i started playing i eventually got the hang of it.Also the visuals aren't too impressive. it's really just a board with pieces on it and some music in the background which actually bugged out on me once and just stopped. it didnt hinder the game at all, it was just less musical.I could give some arbitrary numerical score but overall i reccommend it and i definately hope a community grows around it so it can see further development.arbitrary score:pi x the square root of negative x where x is the number of sex cards available in the first game / something of slightly higher value... like actually getting laid.... dang this revew ran long, hope it was helpful..."

Everything works fairly well. (The dice are a little funky, but eh... whatever).I love the Witcher series. I was excited when this game was announced. I was excited to see this game hit the store.If you you love The Witcher Adventure Game, and want a digital implementation, then stop reading and just buy it.If you haven't played The Witcher Adventure Game, let me stop you right there and say ""Don't"". Go buy Merchants of Venus, Xia: Legend of a Drift System, Steam, Merchants & Marauders, Istanbul, or even Firefly: The Game. Those are all vastly superior Pick-Up and Deliver games - which is all this is. An unnessessarily complicated, frustrating, painful, lengthy Pick-Up and Deliver game.It's a mean game. And I don't mean that in the way that Diplomacy or even Munchkin is a ""mean game"". Or even how ""Ghost Stories is brutally difficult"". I mean this game stabs you in the liver, and then deducts points from you because you're bleeding like a wimp.The designer is a wonderful designer. He also owns the game publisher ""Portal Games"". Go check out all of his other games (Robinson Crusoe, Imperial Settlers, 51st State, The New Era, Pret-a-Porter). This doesn't even measure up to the worst game I've played from Fantasy Flight.The interaction between players is awful. It's mostly a solitare experience. Which doesn't help when the game points how you don't have any friends.The turns are very repetative. Especially when the game finally gets you into the fetal position, and all it leaves you to do is to rock back and forth as you bleed from your severed ankles.Ever played Bunco? Where you just roll the dice, hoping to roll three of a kind? No agency. No decision making. Just luck of the RNG. This game wants you to roll a 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 of a kind with 3-4 dice - and that's not really an exaggeration.When when you fail, because - well - math, you take damage.Nothing good really happens to you. And when it does, like finally completing one of your quests, you STILL get punished. For a good ol' fashioned ""Good job. ♥♥♥♥ you."" - like mom use to say.The monsters seem incredibly out of balance. Rolling the dice usually seems like a wasted effort. There ARE things you HAVE to get in order to over come the dice, but those dont' seem well balanced either.This is easily one of the worst board game experiences I've had in the last few years.The only value this game has had for me is that I only spent $8 on this before foolishly spending $60 at my local game store. And for that, I'll look very favorably at it.10/10."

That is the biggest no no. Dice combat.Combat should be skill based, not the result of a random dice roll.What should be dice or randomly based is traveling. Because when you travel, anything can happen, anything can make you stop. It makes sense.Very often Geralt and Triss get wounded by a drowner card. Which makes not too much sense since they are very skilled fighters. I mean it can happen but that's where the skill of the player should come in just like in the actual games. That is more fun.It is a nice idea of making The Witcher universe expand into board games, action figures, comic books and other forms of media but this board game should be analyzed further. Maybe it needs a sequel that addresses the problems on combat and travel so it can make more sense and not frustrate you."

Characters, environments and monsters all give it that excellent feel that the games have. Detailed and impressive art work can be found from it's map to the monster cards. It has the look and feel of an actual board game.I've invested a few hours of the game and have played a few of the ""Complete 3 Quests"" games. The pacing of the game is alright, though a bit of downtime between turns towards the late game. Be prepared to do something in the background while you wait your turn. A signal to anounce that your turn has come would be very helpful.One major complaint I have with this game is it seems you are penialized for doing practically everything. I understand that the universe of The Witcher is a very unforgiving thing, but having to draw a fate card for almost every action (while having a fate token on an action) seems excessive. Most games I have played I have spent either trying to remove Fate tokens from my actions, or healing from wounds. I don't know if this is a major part of the game, dealing with Fate tokens, but it became more of an annoyance.The quest system works well. Having to do investigations to gain resources works well and having side quests helps along the way to acheieving your quests. Side quests can give a bit more flavour to the game and is a great way to earn some extra Victory Points.The battle system is alright, though it reminds me more of Elder Sign than anything else. Roll dice, match symbols, if you have enough, you win! If you don't! Bad stuff happens (if you don't defend).The game has a lack of save system, which I find odd. So if you're wanting to play a long game but don't have the time to invest, prepare to be disapointed or to have the game run in the background.For me, the game does a very good job of emulating a board game, but the mechanics are either ones I've played from other games, and does much better or just flat out annoy me for existing. I cannot really recommend this game."

This allows one to get a feel for the game goals, mechanics, and character abilities.  Overall, it is a fairly simple game, but for the price, is a unique game implementation.Playing against the AI tends to get old quickly, but this is a great game to play with one's children if one is an older gamer with children such as myself.  The rules are relatively easy to understand, and the implementation of cards can be a useful tool to help children with their reading abilities.  The game encourages them to think ahead, and consider the probable outcomes.  Playing alone gets old, but given the price and nature of the game, I highly recommend it as a ""family game"" to play with the kids."

It's far more involved than Gwent, and requires far more time to pick up and to play through.For it's price, it's worth picking up, and when future updates are released (hopefully expanding the tutorial and adding a few more playable characters) it should give you plenty of reasons to sink a fair amount of time into this game.TL;DR:It's not Gwent.

I think the game does need work, but as it stands it is an enjoyable experience.The boardgame does have its advantages over the computerised title due to different rule sets that people have made for the witcher which fixes some 'issues' (opinion) with the lack of player on player interaction, as it is more of a solitary experience.That being said, there are some glaring issues with the pc version. I have come across some very odd encounters that I can only explain as bugs.- There is a creature that tells the player ''before rolling place a foul token in an adjacent region''What happens instead is the game forces you to place a foul token on your own player.--EDIT--This happens when all of your adjacent regions already have foul fates on them. That being said, the game at the time does a poor job of explaining that, and glosses over it immediately, forcing you to place a token on yourself.- There is a card that tells you if you have a 'vauble information' card you can trade it for 3 leads. The problem is that this doesn't appear to be a choice, despite the text. If you do have a valuable information card, you have held on to for other reasons, it will take it away from you and assume its the choice you wanted to make.- I swear I have had an instance of a card telling me 'x' or 'y' but it has done both, but I cannot recall 100% so maybe it didnt happen (I swear it did)I will be reporting these issues with picture examples when I get the chance and will update this if there are fixes.As it stands I would still recommend this title as it is fantastic to play. especially on sale currently for £2.09!Great boardgame from great developers"

It's meant to be role-played, you have to read the quests to feel any kind of depth. The formula is actually very close to the actual Witcher games: you have a main quest and some side quests. As you try to finish the main quest you get sidetracked with tasks and character development and do other things. Being a computer game, you don't have to keep track of the game rules that much, the game does it for you, so you have more time to concentrate on the fights and quests.As a multiplayer experience I feel that it's not that fun, though. There is very little player interaction, so there's no point in it being a multiplayer experience really. You might as well play alone without even any AI players.Some of the mechanics could have been improved, there are no keyboard shortcuts, which prevents effective Steam Controller use (mouse only).But overall I think it's a quaint little game, Witcher fans will enjoy it."
