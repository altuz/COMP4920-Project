To me it's like they used fifa 06 player models. I expected better, I mean hb studios had something to do with madden right so why couldn't they give us better player models?  Only 2 camera views. Really? End on and side on with no zoom or other settings!! Not great.In terms of gameplay the controls are fairly smooth and it does play well, certainly less button mashing than other rugby games of the past. Having only just started playing it is just an initial impression, I found it easy enough to do the basics at least.The game lacks the customisation options I think. You can change players names and heights and positions but I can't seem to find where you can change their appearance, maybe I am missing something or team names either. Also the super 15 squads are completely different from the international squads so it is hard to know if you changed a player's name in super rugby, whether its the same player in an international team.So far I am 50/50 on this game. It seems a little juvenile for an HD quality game (stuck at least 4-5 years ago in respect to  Graphics and models). Certainly with all the mods and customisation and player modelling RC2 seems to be the better game honestly, although the gameplay is actually quite good. If they could improve the player models then this game would be better. Unfortunately we suffer again when it comes to rugby games"

The graphics are extremely poor which I could probably deal with if the physics and gameplay weren't terrible as well. Rugby 08 was a great game and this is what is confusing, rugby 15 is literally the opposite. I should of avoided this game based on the fact that there was not any official gameplay videos pre-release, only a theatrical trailer. I honestly don't understand why the developers would release this game. It's an insult to the gaming community and the rugby community! If you are on the fence about buying Rugby15.....do not buy it, the developers don't deserve another cent."

They then brought out World Cup 2011 which was basically Rugby 08 upgraded to almost HD gfx and with online play. With the this next iteration they threw the baby out with the bath water. The graphics are worse, there's no online multiplayer and most importantly they changed the whole physics and game mechanics, which was was actually what stood out for me. It felt like you were in control of the players, which is not the case with Rugby 15. I just can't believe that someone can put this game out there and charge $36 for it. Probably my own fault. They didn't show any gameplay footage before launch. Also, this game was supposed to be delayed till January and was released in November anyways. This is a testament to how bad the game really is. This game is full of bugs, does not play smoothly and the AI is really bad for a game that has no online play."

The unfortunate nature of being both is that Rugby games aren't as diverse and popular as football, basketball or even Hockey games and very few shine through. Unfortunately if Rugby 15 is a sign of things to come, Rugby games will be under some dark times. Glitches galore, overly simple gameplay, really awful graphics and no online features to speak of, there's very little to praise the game for and even then I'd be looking at minor things, then I'm reminded that players can implode and turn invisible during a match. Not even joking.Don't buy this, save your money. I would say play the Rugby Challenge games instead but... they're no longer on Steam... well ♥♥♥♥..."

More importantly - just like RWC 2011 - it's not fun.I'm torn between recommending this game so that the developers can consider patching it OR not recommending it because it seems like they didn't care in the first place.I've played almost every Rugby and Rugby League game, I buy them (on the consoles) in support of the games and hopefully that it will generate enough support to keep them going.I played this with the xbox 360 controller.Let's start on the Passing.The ball physics operate, where the ball seems it's pumped with half oxygen and the other half helium.When passes are made - it's almost too easy to pick out where the ball will be received. Unfortunately, the collision detection (or player detection) is at stage where even if you are in a prime position to intercept (which is all the time) you still won't receive the ball.It has a single pass button only. Whereas previously, it was a 2 button pass option (left button = pass left, right button = pass right). This is a horrible development because you lose the ability to direct players and have players run off the ruck.""Apparently"" if you hold the pass button and release, the pass will skip the player next to the ball carrier - this happens occasionally. It's a lucky dip.You can use a thumbstick to highlight the receiver and pass it to them, which is a good innovation but requires some fine tuning.The games ability to judge forward passess has gone backwards from the previous itinerations. (i'm talking about Rugby 08 and RWC 11)The Kicking.All kicking in general play (grubber, chip and chase, punt and bomb) has a power indicator (which shows how much force you're using) BUT no directional indicator. This means you have to GUESS where your kick is going to go.When kicking to start play (22 Drop out, Kick restarts) you can move the player in the direction of where you want to kick, but it will only highlight the player (and move him in the direction) and not the direction of the kick.RucksThey've streamlined the ability to win the Rucks and simplified the process, however, they have moved away from one of the challenges of adding and removing players from the ruck. There is NO ability to add a player to ruck. Everything is done automaticly and then you are required to toggle your thumbstick to battle your opponent to win the ruck.This mechanic is used again for Scrums and Mauls.I could go on - (especially about the A.I., Gameplay in general, Offensive and Defensive moves etc) - but most of it would be negative.The positives are that the screens are clean. It's visually a pretty game. The money spent on something like Madden vs this make it a no contest. BUT for what it is - it's definitively a graphical improvement over the last few itinerations.To be fair, I don't really care about the licensing, I don't care which teams feature - I believe that if a fun game is made, and has alot of depth in the gameplay itself - then everything else is a low priority.In alot of ways, had this game been made in early 2000 - it would've been the greatest Rugby game ever.It wasn't and it's not yet close to being a good rugby game.This game has no depth, it's not fun to play by myself or even with others.Maybe some patching will fix some of the issues.In writing this - I've decided to NOT recommend the game."

Can't get more than 15% power. Should be more like Tiger Woods golf swing rather than the awkward flick forward.When passing back to the fly half from a maul or rick, the fly half ALWAYS gets tackled before he can kick it.  Kills the ability to play a territorial game as you have to run everything.When chasing a player and you attempt a dive tackle, the animation kills any momentum and the player just drops to the floor.No method of changing pace/sprinting.Poor selection of camera views. Should ideally zoom in and out when kicking to touch.Graphics are poor quality."

,Recommended,303820,19420373,"Posted: 1 December, 2015",all,FP05,"This game is alright.... if you can get it on sale. The game itself reminds me of the old rugby games that EA Sports used to make, which is why they most likely why they tried to make the logo for the game look like it was made by a recent EA Group. Make no mistake, you play in the same Field, and the players for every team seem to have the same 20 player models. The announcers did a good job and can make you feel more inclined to play the game. The game itself feels like it is lacking a few big features for any sports games, such as different stadiums and a replay. The game just sorta cuts to the pause screen when you hit halftime and when the game ends. If they could add an instant replay the game would feel like a more complete game. There is no career mode, however you can setup custom tournaments but there is no multiple season game modes. The game is also SUPER GLITCHY. It can add to the fun when you watch players fall through the field and also watching players run in place. This however is a big problem when your player will be on a breakaway and then he will stop and then a player will glitch forward and tackle the player. The game itself runs really well, I run Windows 10 and have 8GB of ram and a non-gaming intel processor and I have been playing on the highest setting. The game does perform well for the $7 price tag that I picked it up for, but for 39.99 it is not worth picking up. Wait for it to go on sale or go to gamestop and look for a rugby game for the xbox 360. This is basically EA Sports Rugby games from back in 2005. I like the game, but wait for a sale."

,Recommended,303820,16334935,"Posted: 12 June, 2015",all,LastNameHandy,"So, I decided to buy this game regarldess of all the negative reviews, mainly because I couldn't pass up a Rugby game for $10.  Compared to the other rugby games I have played (Rugby '08, Rugby World Cup 2011, and Jonah Lomu's Rugby Challenge), this gsmr is a bit different and has a learning curve for controls.  Is it a terrible Rugby game? Not in my opinion.  Not the best, but unplayable.My analysis:Pros:- It's a virtual rugby game, which there are few that have been made compared to the mainstream sports- Updated graphics, compared to the older rugby games- Plenty of teams (if not all) and tournament modes to choose- Decent GUI (easy to navigate)Cons:- Glitchy. Passes sometimes goes right when you're passing left, sometimes they'll throw it WAY up in the air, players get caught on scrums / bunched up players / etc,- the AI for the opposing team and your inactive teammates is pretty bad.  They tend to stand there when te ball is lying on the ground, defeneders sometimes will back off when you're on the breakaway, will stand there and wait for ball to be passed to them, etc.- No group tackling.  While running straight at a group of defenders, only one will attempt to tackle, while the rest stand there dumbfounded and even back away.  This ties into bad AI and adds to the glithiness I mentioned above.- Kicking can be better.  On kickoffs, you can't choose the stength, arch, or distance of kick.  You face a direction and press a button...- No Multiplayer mode, at least not yetIn short, If you want this game, just buy this if/when it's on sale.

However, the idea of the game is good and I hope there is plenty of updates in the future to fix th bugs in game.  Would of been nice if there was replays and a couple of different stadiums, looking at the same ground everytime really gets a bit boring.

The graphics seem outdated and all of the players look alike.The game claims to have real teams but you will find the international teams such as; England, Wallabies, Boks and All Blacks are not and just use the respective country's names and flags. As mentioned above the players for these teams are generic too. They all look the same size and ethnicity. This might be because the camera angle is quite high but in my opinion that takes away detail as players start to look like ants.There seems to be some bugs in the game where players disappear. This happens most frequently after a maul. I contacted the developers last week about this to see if there was a patch but I have not heard back from them.While I respect the work it takes to make a game it doesn't reach my expectations considering the price and I probably should have done some research and watched some lets play videos to see what it was like but as it stands I am nonplussed with this game and looks like I'll be moving on.

76561198028310132,Recommended,303820,16490739,"Posted: 17 June, 2015",all,ShadowThingey,"I bought this game when it was on Sale for $10.00/ €8.79. An excellent deal and thus i dont feel as bad after purchasing this for it's regular $40.00/  €35.17. The review will begin now.I have not played too much,  but i have played more than enough to give a good opinion and i have seen the most positive and most negative aspects of this game.First off what you see,Graphics:Being far from the pitch you cant see much detail even if you tried and due to not bieng any camera angles that bring you that close everything looks quite crisp and smooth. Sadly however the crowd is obviosuly nothing but pixelated flat sprites, but the game helps it self by adding a fake depth of field effect over them so they are much less atrocious to view.The lighting effects are rather good and allow good color to pop through, there is nothing special or fancy about this game; no HBAO or SSAO not even actual blades of grass protruding from the ground and many animations are glitched up from time, but everything is so fast paced and far you dont notice much.  Running on the Unity Engine the game is optimized and looks good enough, however not at all what i'd call ""Next Gen"" Rugby Challenge 2 crushes Rugby 15 graphically however it too had glitches in animation. Overall the gaphics of this dont truly hurt it at all. Graphics 7/10Gameplay:This game seriously wanted to try something new, not only to rugby video games, but every sporting video game. You dont simply press a button to pass the ball, you must aim in the general area of the player you wish to pass it to then press RT. This mechanic sadly however causes many glitches in this game, such as the ball going through an opposing team player simply phasing through them. The game's engine is very,very easy on you as you can accidentally pass foward without any penalty, but this mechanic seriously allows this game to be ultra fluid allowing you to not have to hessitate before passing, but unreal god like passes can be made with hardly a chance to get a knock on.Rucks: are great in this game however the player animations are practically non existent just squating and binding onto each other with no real pushing or struggle to speak of making rucks  looking awkward however this does not hinder the overall mechanic as unlike in Rugby Challenge 2 the time to win a ruck is more realistic and theres practically no time having to struggle sadly though this removes the tactical fun in planning out a proper ruck like in RC2.Scrums:are a huge part in rugby and in this game well its not a timing game like in RC2, you seriously just push up and RT to hook the ball and if you feel like it you can just collapse the scrum for fun at the press of the button...yep because why not.Line Outs:in this game are simulated quite well, you have to prepare the jumper with LT then hold RT to lift them once again no timing like  in RC2 just 3 button presses and skill along with some luck as you do have some time to react to the other team's lineout movements.Fending and overall evading:is quite fun since you do have to aim the right stick towards the opposing player and flick the right stick left or right to sidestep. With the right stick it feels similar to a less andvanced version of NBA 2k 15's Pro Stick.Trying: Is rather easy in this game due to the AI being a bit stupid, but giving a pretty great fight. To score a try enter the try zone and press the right stick.Tackling:can be certainly easy in Rugby 15 as you just move to stick at the player with the ball to dive, otherwise just run into them and tackle them with your arms, less effective as they can fend, but you have a better change to hit them.Conversions: are a great mini game where you pull the right stick back and push it foward however,accidentally rocking it left or right will screw up your kicking direction.Replays: dont exist at all and definently kill some of the fun, a good chunk and playing RC2 made me always expect a replay after every penalty is called or every try is made. Without them you feel rather cheated as you cant see where you messed up or that amazing move you made when you being a Right Wing fended that Prop Foward in the face. You just can't recap the game like that sadly. I feel this wasnt included due to the low quality graphics that HB didnt want you to see, but its fine making it feel even more realistic. Even though i rather had seen replays regardless of how bad the graphics are up close.Closing statement: Rugby 15 is a great fun arcady easy to pick and play Rugby Game where the right stick plays the biggest role and that is the fact that makes this a more enjoyable experience.Sadly however this doesnt feel as realistic as Rugby Challenge 2. I feel less intensity and less immersion when playing Rugby 15, but its certainly a game you can play with you friends(if you by chance do play local multiplayer on PC like me) Playing through a match is fun and something you will never stress about while in Rugby Challenge 2 it feels like there are true stakes as the All Blacks destroy everyone on that game while though tougher than most teams in Rugby 15 they are easily beaten. You just dont get the authentic rugby experience, but as it stands theres nothing wrong with this game(other than the lack of many Licenses to teams, but thats A-Okay! I rate this 7/10 for the price i paid, but for $40 i would say 5/10. Just buy this on sale."
