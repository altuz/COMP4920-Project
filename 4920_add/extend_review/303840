Also it has a pretty cool perk/score system that makes it very replayable."

There aren't really any hidden depths; it's a game where you click and drag to kill things while avoiding actual contact with them. What you see is what you get. Even for $5, it just doesn't seem as interesting as other free games I've played. In just 20 minutes, I feel like I've already seen all the game has to offer. Some interesting achievements might have gone a little further in expanding the concept, or maybe some more powerups and upgrades.As it stands, it's just a little arcade game. Perhaps a good mindless game to unwind and abnegate with, but not great for extended play sessions. The frustrating difficulty (not to mention the game taunting you if you play poorly enough) and lack of depth make it get old fast."

However it is not quite a complete game yet, with a lot more options needed in the options section and only a few playable characters. However it is still a new game, and with the great reception this game has recieved I am sure it will further motivate the developers to make this game better. I am still new to this game, but my final verdect has to be 9/10."

The experience is frustrating as heck, yet I keep coming back for more...  The element of randomness means each run is different from the last, and means you will be forced to learn from your mistakes and quickly adapt to any given scenario."
,Recommended,303840,11304522,"Posted: 18 July, 2014",all,[G@mer]But terd,"First Try on Point PerfectThe video is available here:http://youtu.be/JSK7RcIvs9QLet's start off with the fact that the game uses 8-bit graphics and music, which you might have figured out already, when you've watched the promotional material of the game. With that said, if you are not a fan of the modern 8-bit style, you might not want to buy that game. Other than that I have to say that the asthetic of the game appeals to me personally and I find it good for what it is.Let's move on to the options menu: There is no slider for the music, only a button to switch it on or off. For sound effects there are more options available.Graphicswise the only option is how big of a window you want. Even with pressing several F-Keys on the Keyboard and pressing alt+enter, I was not able to have a fullscreen mode, you basically the best you can get is a windowed fullscreen.Gameplaywise this could lead to the problem of you going out of bounds with your mouse and locking it into position as long as you are not going back into bounds. What has to be said though is that the game immeadiately recognizes the position of your mouse when you back into bounds, which dampens the harm that is done here greatly. It has to be said as well that you should not go out of bounds that often, since the game encourages you to have controlled mouse movement via instantly killing you when you move around too frantically.So, into the game we venture and we find us dying immediately... at least that was me at my very first attempt. The game punishes your old habits of trying to swipe over/into enemies or to klick them. After the initial shock the game shows itself with a relatively smooth learning curve, giving you the chance to improve with every round you play.The game has hard parts as well, but none of which can be considered unfair. The bossfights seem unbeatable at first, but with enough practice you will find out what they can do and deal at least a little damage to them.(Which is as far as I have got)Stagewise I can say that you have a pool of stages which will come randomly and so far(after about 10 games, which are 30 runs) I found for myself enough variety in them. When you don't get past the first boss for a very long time though it might become repetetive so keep that in mind.Finally the tl:dr: Is it worth it?If you are a fan of casual games, which you can pick up, play them for 10-20 minutes and put them away again, I consider it a definite buy for you.For the avid gamer who wants his old habits questioned by another game(after antichamber and the stanley parable), I'd say buy it.For the people that don't find themselves in one of the two groups, described above, I'd wait for a sale, if I were you.And finally, if you can't be asked with anything the game has to offer or you find the problems I've stated too big of an issue, I would leave my hands off that gameAs for myself, I have to say, I enjoyed it and I can recommend it."

If you touch an enemy/wall/projectile or whatever, you will die and lose a life.  It requires alot of fast reflexing and focus. There is no manual or tutorial but on the same time you only need a mouse cursor. I didnt knew you were able to drag with the cursor to make block to kill enemies. I thought the only thing what u have to do is avoid. The game has ""achievements and unlockments"". You are able to choose from some ""abilities"" before you are goign to start. 1 more HP, get 1 point each second. and Drag power level 1.Game is super Repetitive.Doesn't have alot of variety.Only Mouse cursor required.Alot of Trial and error.There is no Pause button, If you press ESC you will get kicked to Main menu with a nice results of losing all CURRENT progress.If you have died, you will lose all of your power. (unless ability)Other things.Game has some References to other games and things.Developer trying to be funny with ""text"".I have the feeling hitbox isn't always 100% correct.The more power you have the bigger your drag will be.-------------------I Give this game a 3/10"

In the game you begin with 3 classes: Vitality (You start with 3 lives), Utility (Your attacking square gets larger), and Greed (You get points 30 frames quicker than normal). I think it is a good way to waste time on a Saturday morning and will make your mouse skills increase. I give this game a 9/10 rating."

It takes after one of those harder, frustrating-to-play kinds of games and it does that well. Unfortunately, it has no tutorial (not one that I can recall anyway) and the hints it gives are just insults to the player. The insults are meant to be funny, but I felt that it's very obvious that the developer(s) tried too hard to make it funny and it just missed the bar completely. The only reason I still play this is because there are Steam achievements. Only buy this so there can be more trading cards in circulation (don't buy this if you don't plan to trade them with/give them to me). :)"
