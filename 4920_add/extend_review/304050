,Not Recommended,304050,30021764,Posted: 18 February,all,Paragon,"Let me tell an amazing story about what trove what once was compared to what trove is now.EDIT3: HERE IS A COUNTUP FOR THE TIME THE DEVELOPERS STILL HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO THIS REVIEW.https://www.tickcounter.com/countup/22961/time-since-no-developer-reponse-for-my-top-review-on-trove-with-various-complaintsWhat was:An amazing sandbox/RPG style game that existed when I was in 8th grade(around 2 years ago). I would log in with one of my best friends and play, level, and build. Classes cost in game currency, so it only took around ~2 months for me of playing an hour a day to obtain every single class. Leveling was not difficult, mounts were not hard to get, and reaching max level was only a matter of time and not that far from people who spent money on this game. Market was somewhat balanced, item mall did not give too many OP items, and it was possible to see people reach max level without spending a single cent. Streamers were nice, loved the game(I was part of a streamer's guild and watched 20+ hours of his stream), and had massive giveaways that simply made every minute of this game fun to play. Grinding was not that annoying since drop rates were not unreasonable, and crafting materials were not so difficult to find or buy from others. When I would happen to get bored(very rarely), it would be a 'why not' to just go ahead and play some soccer from a stadium one of the guild members created. Toxicity and scammers were uncommon, since many people were flourishing and being quite successful both economically and emotionally. I was mastery 60/100 at that time after only about ~150 hours(before steam release obviously).After Steam Release:Trove created a ""Patron Pass"", basically a premium subscription based system that when activated, gave double drop rate, double exp, and multiple other benefits. This seemed miniscule at first, since not only was this given out two weeks for free, the buffs do not look that overpowered at first. However, at a deeper glance, trove seemed to slowly lower drop rates for rare items, and people would have to rely on Patron benefits to simply live like the old life of the f2p player BEFORE the steam release. However, this by itself was not bad, since trove gained more populrity, Trion struggeld to keep servers up. Level cap increased to 200. I only pushed myself for another 40-50 hours to make myself readch around level 90/200. Many systems were added to late game characters that seemed to break the economy, as late game players were the ones with 99% of the money. Imagine the game's economy going into a Republican form of economy, that's how it became. Materials became 20x more expensive(Going from 1 flux to 20) and some items were downright impossible to afford. I realized even though I spend more than 150 hours on this game before steam release, I was no poorer than a brand new player who spent 10 hours after steam realease.After the ""Cancer Patch"":This. This is the patch that ruined the game. Trion made it so classes could no longer be purchased with in game currency.  Trion claimed that this was to increase the variety among the classes and make people feel more individualized. However, nothing was actually done TO the classes to make them feel more different. In fact, besides a few unnoticable buffs/nerfs, classes remained virtually the same, so Trion failed to communicate that to the people. Although I had every single class(they released a class later that I obviously cannot get without giving them my cash), it seemed like a horrendously stupid move as more people started to actually play this game.The classes problem was only the beginning. They added flying mounts later(Dragons). At first this sounds like an amazing idea, as these flying mounts were faster than wings. However, you'd have to do daily quests every day for around a month to obtain one. That system was cancer, since logging in every day to do the same thing just to log out was monotonous and boring, Trion decided to scrap that system too. Since players were actually obtaining these mounts(How horrible right? /s), Trion decided to nerf this system and make a convoluted system where getting these dragons was near impossible and you would literally have to spend x3 the time getting these materials(since they divided the item into a 3 part item that needed to be crafted, hence x3 the time), getting these mounts was a fruitless endeavor.As stated before, the economy was in ruin, so there was no way to be able to recover without buying items to sell in the item mall, or buying mounts directly that increased your level. I gave up at level 100/300, dirt broke even after grinding in the beta and doing 50 hours of grinding after steam release. Streamers have quit, even the streamer's guild I mentioned before had dissipated(LegendaryStudios). All my friends quit and think of this only as a 'meme game'. After Trion added more and more to the item mall that made this game completely pay2win, this game became a generic f2p that lost all originality that this game once was.  This game had a lot of history with me, and now that simply is just a memory.Beta:9/10Steam Release:5/10""Cancer"" Patch:1/10EDIT1:I have recently read other reviews and I have noticed a common pattern. Devs seem to ignore and lock threads that have expressed concerns for the huge amount of bugs(since I did not mention these in my original review), huge gameplay downsides, and obvious player distaste for the cancer patch. When the players showed their absolute animosity towards changing a major system in the game(such as the classes costing real money), Trion did NOTHING to calm down the players or change this horrible system.EDIT2:I never knew this review would actually gain a lot of support from the steam community, so thanks for the support. However, I will say be wary of this review and if it gets taken down, you know what happened."

Save your time and money.I can't emphasize this enough, yes its ""free to play"" but you WILL end up paying something, if not a lot of your hard earned cash. 90% of the same old bugs from beta are still there, events are recycled to the point everyone just AFK farms them and the actual content updates come around once a year. All that is left is grinding.Once you get to U9, where the majority of the people are, you will be plagued by rubber banding, slow chunk loading and constant disconnects. The devs really don't care, the fact they refuse to comment on it and delete or lock threads on the forum where people express their concerns, shows this. They just want new people to play, get hooked and shell out loads of cash before they realize it.I wish I had been warned before I invested so much time/money into the game. (not through steam)Trove is a great game at its core, its just run by a greedy, money grabbing company with absolutely no respect for its players/customers."

It is an amazing break from World of Warcraft as leveling up to about 15ish is very easy going.  Weekly rewards are nice to get, and the in-game community is pretty nice and helpful.  Dailies are nice too as after x amount of times opening Chaos Chest, you are guarenteed a mount/ally/something cool.  You get a lot of free stuff at first - like Mastery Rewards and cheap in-game deals (I would suggest buying the starter pack if you can spare $10).  I was expecting to find a lot of little kids playing this game, but I've actually found more young adults and some older adults too.If grinding and patience is not your thing, you will not enjoy this game.  The game does have some lag issues, and I've died a few times to it, but it's not all the time.   Building in this game is a bit different than Minecraft, and if you hate building there are plenty of other things to do.  It's definetly more enjoyable with friends or finding new in-game friends!"

Even though it is virtually dead, atleast I can see where we first plotted our spawn point, the musical roads, a good quantity of mazes produced throughout the club's life time and numerous buildings that were once endevours. So many friends I stumbled upon during my activeness in the game. I love building with my Trove buddies more than that actual mining, leveling up, and slaining bosses. Happiness filled my soul because of this marvelous game."

,Not Recommended,304050,29880067,Posted: 12 February,all,Fascist Polarbear,"Trove... Where to start with Trove...I was a long time player of Trove, disregard the time I've played, as I started sometime way back in 2014, near the end of closed beta, I believe, and the game was great. The combat was simple enough that anyone could pick it up and, after a few battles, know how to play their class. The worlds were flooded with people looking to find new recipes and improve their cornerstones in any way, while also looking for gear and xp. The worlds were beautiful and it felt like you were actually getting somewhere when you went from one world to another, as new biomes were added and new enemies alongside it. Everything could be done for free, at the time there were only 3 classes (I think...), gunslinger, knight, and fae trickster. You started the game with the knight and the gunslinger, and every other class could be bought with the ingame currency, Cubits. New classes were added left and right (I took a liking to the Dracolyte), and it felt like the devs truly cared about the game, as they fixed every bug someone came acrossed.As I continued to play, they introduced more things, such as the dragons. The dragons started out pretty simple, you had little ""missions"" that would pop up every once in a while, tasking you with completing dungeons, and if you used a certain class, you'd get 2 points rather than one, and you'd need 5 points to get your first dragon cache (sorry if any of these things aren't the correct terms, haven't played in a while), and another if you got somewhere in the 20s. These caches had a chance to give you things such as dragon essence and souls, which were used to ascend and get companions and mounts. The concept was great, I had fun with it, and many others did too.After a while it started to go downhill REALLY quickly. The first sign was, well, the devs removed the ability to buy classes with cubits. At first it seemed harmless, they still gave out class coins every once in a while, and the classes themselves weren't too expensive. Then they added gems, which I'm not too familiar on, but supposedly just make you straight up better than others, and the things to obtain them were either really rare (rare, RNG, same thing, just RNG is less reliable), or could be bought with real cash. At this time, I quit, the community was destroyed, the game was broken, and nothing was rewarding.Game used to be good, then Trion did what Trion does best.Edit: Take what I say with a grain of salt, haven't played in a while."

But when I came back as a veteran of the game, it seemed to be MUCH better than when I left.This game is amazing, don't let the negative reviews tell you otherwise. This game has many, many ways a player can work around premium, so therefore it is not ""pay to play"" or ""pay to win."" Premium in my opinion is just a perk that some less hard working players use, and people who have no patience don't want to deal with the farming. These are the types of players the negative reviews are created from.The building mode is precise and very much worth it when you complete a project. The progress slows down a bit as you level up depending on the type of player you are, which I love. It is a very get-down-to-it sort of game.Definitely not reccomended for impatient people, but I am VERY patient, so this is just the game for me."
,Recommended,304050,30241332,Posted: 28 February,all,H.o.W-Umbrella,"Trove of adventures!As i'm sure everyone would say after playing this game, where should I begin?Graphics:If I had to say, I wouldn't say top notch. The graphics is okay, they can bug you. Minecraftish style but not as bad. There is alot more animation's, alot more detail. Do not take this the wrong way. The game hasn't done wrong, it feels right in a blocky sense of way.Gameplay:Fantastic, that's what I say. The gameplay makes up for alot within the game. You can find alot to do. The recent ingame changes are also very nice. New level caps also I noticed. I know Trove gets some nice updates and some odd ones. Either way you cut the cake, you might still get cherries ontop. What I mean is, the updates normally consists of cons n pros, depending on wether you like cherries or not, some cons to others are pros.I honestly can't say how much gameplay there is while describing each one. It is just too much. You'll have to read more about it if you don't already know much. Basic gameplay is both creative and adventure. You will want friends or a club world to help out. You can own your own worlds, house, pets. You can wear any decoration, infact, the loot collector and item hunting is very uniqe making you as a player want to find every piece. Each piece you collect is saved & can be overlayered on set equipment. Base game rewards, item shop, minor NPC support. Alot to keep you going. It is mostly PvE, PvP is a thing too.SoundFX:While being blocky in a block like world, you'd expect the characters of the world to sound different. They have nailed this. Music and sounds are pretty good. I'd have to say it wasn't expected but yes, the game sounds are good. The basic attack or hit sounds however is the same old sound, some soundFX are loopy.PTW or FTP?:This is one of the big concerns when entering a FTP game. Yes, it is FTP. 100%The great thing about trove is how much they actually have to offer FTP. They don't charge you for club worlds or properties, they don't charge you for alot that they could or other games had or do now. The PTW options are minor but continues to support the servers. As any game, PTW has the options to speed up you're progress towards the game or simply for cosmetic styles. It is simply a choice. Do you enjoy the game? Do you feel it is under valued? Do you feel like the devs did decent work? Questions you ask yourself may lead to you spending a few bucks. But by all means, it is only optional, the choices we're in control to make. The game I'd have to say is FTP.Personnal notes:This isn't survival, nor is it up to the standards of graphics these days. It is something I do enjoy playing so I must recommend it. Creativity lovers will really enjoy Trove as most already have. I do suggest playing Trove, espeacially if you don't mind low end graphics with high gameplay value.Be warned,it is a MMO, it is a RPG. put these two together, you got yourself a cracked egg. The game can be very addictive as any MMORPG.Graphics:5.0SoundFX:6.0Funfactor:7.5Overall:6.5Edited reasons:Added ratings belowFixed descriptions"
,Recommended,304050,29701038,Posted: 4 February,all,Crunchy Toe,"Huge potential wasted. I played this when it first came out and the servers struggled; understandibly. Fast forward a few years and the player numbers have drastically declined and the servers are still poor.The gameplay is okay and even though there is huge focus around grinding, it's a fun sort of grind because you're constantly working towards things and getting epic loot. It kind of reminds me of a third person ARPG (or in this case an AMMORPG). Even though it is free to play, you can see Trion's greed wheels turning in their minds. Almost everything has a pay wall and though there are ways to earn things through challenges and chests, it is very limiting. Some items for example, the re-gemerator, are purchase only, but when gems go wrong or you wish to replace them, then you must buy them and depending on many times you screw up, this can mount up across multiple character playthroughs. Every new slot in the second inventory (backpack) is divided up into paid slots (there are 3 inventory backpacks I believe). 500 credits each for 5 slots (there are approximately 30-40 spaces in each inventory). Storage space costs double but you get more.I simply cannot believe how poor the servers are and how little has been added to the game over the years, especially when Trion has filled the game with so many forms of microtransactions (and even a subscription service) and when the quality of the game is simply not up to par.There's undoubtedly a lot of naive kids, probably enjoying the game, but paying ludicrous amounts for frankly shocking quality. The servers are completely unforgivable though and I have never in my life seen any game with this amount of microtransactions in it.The argument and defensive points around MT and subscription services are - it's optional. Sure, sure it is. However the game is seriously watered down and the value for those who do invest in the game is poor to say the least. I still cannot wrap my head around just how bad the servers are (hence repeating myself). The lag affects combat and occasionally disconnects happen at inopportune times, which results in you being put into a queue - this usually only lasts a few minutes - but still an annoying inconvenience.It's a good game to an extent, but it is marred by poor servers, mountains of MT and greedy paywalls and a subpar experience for those who have to grind excessively if they do not want to spend a fortune on overpriced store purchases. I'd be far more supportive of games like this (as I have on PC games and Android) if not nearly ever important item was sold in the store, the prices were reasonable and the servers were reliable and lag free).Trion have handled this opportunity very poorly and the declining population is not a surprise.What is surprising? I recommend the game. It has charm. It has fun classes. It has lovely, amusing loot - some of which looks badass. It has mounts. It has a nice atmosphere. It's fun for a while and is worth checking out, but don't be too disappointed if you experience lag spikes or your jaw drops at just how many things these guys are willing to sell (and the prices they charge).I know there are some diehard fans who will likely disagree with me, but I do hope that people at least try to see where I am coming from before rating this review."

For anyone that loves to become more and more powerful by leveling up and playing with friends, this is the game for you. For anyone that loves to get endless loot and strive to become one of the most powerful players, this game is for you. But there's a small problem.This game is entirely a money run. I don't think I've ever seen a game that is more pay2win than this one. You can literally buy yourself to being some of the most powerful players in the game, despite all those players that choose not to spend any money. Most people who say this game isn't pay2win are people who have spent hundreds of dollars themselves, choosing to deny their own waste of money. For anyone that still thinks this game isn't controllable with money, look at the ""shop"". You can buy all classes, infinite ""gem dust"", and anything else you need to become maxed out. So unless you want to play this game for three years straight while grinding for what seems to be for a fraction of the power the pay2wins have, be my guest and waste your time.The keyword here, in case you didn't catch it, is: pay2win"

76561198279416567,Recommended,304050,29808523,Posted: 9 February,all,EffortlessPie,"Pros and synopsis: You can play as many different classes, such as a tomb raiser, a dino tamer and a ninja. Each class is suited for a different play style. You can also craft many items, such as dragons and pets. Your main goal is to defeat as many bosses as you can. Bosses are found inside dungeons filled with enemies and traps. Another thing you can do is challenge mighty Shadow Towers. You fight through hordes of enemies to get to one of the titan bosses. If you have a Shadow / Moon / Eclipse key, you can open the shadow vault at the end for a massive amount of loot. You can also participate in PVP and occasionally an event race style game.Cons: Slightly pay-to-win (although gameplay is still possible without paying). I have found the leveling system to be partially annoying. Otherwise a great game."

It can be compared closely to WoW but with much more child friendly aesthetics. It has the blocky feel of minecraft but with heavy MMORPG influences. The community is strong and their are lots of passionate players working hard on their own steam workshop creations for the game. In fact, I'm pretty sure that a large majority of all weapons are made by people like us. Trion Worlds have made solid connections between the community and themselves and I have massive respect for them for doing that. Many companies in this industry lack the ability to be involved in the community.The gameplay is fun, searching and exploring lands while coming across other players, who you can party with to defeat shadow towers or to just explore the land. Just please give this game a try. It has a lot of potential."

,Recommended,304050,29440751,Posted: 23 January,all,Sir †åçø ©,"This game is a lot more fun than it looks. At first when I saw the game on store, I thought it was a really bad attempt at copying Minecraft and other survival games. But I quickly learnt that I was wrong, after trying it out (since the game was FTP). I quickly fell in love with it, both the amount of things inside the game I could do with friends, and the game concept that ties in block building games and RPG in a very neat way. Though maybe to some, the graphics are not the best, as everything is made up of either big or small pixle-blocks, but if you're a fan of 3D pixel graphics like me, or you have actually tried to make 3D riggings of these 3D pixle models, I'm sure you will appreciate the game. The game does not lag a lot for me, despite the servers being located in the US (I live on the other side of the US), and there are many useful and meaningful updates to keep the players interested. This game is great for people who wants to quickly play something before dinner is ready, or could only game a few hours a week due to school, as this game is an easy-to-start and easy-to-put-down game, which means you can quit playing the game at anytime and won't feel bad about it (some games make you feel uneasy to put down by making you lose progress in the game in a certain way if you do quit the game. This game doesn't do that). Anyway, as it's a FTP game, you really don't need to waste your time reading reviews. Only you will know if a game will suit you or not, so instead of reading, get going and give this game a try!"

It is a game in which you use both creativity, adventure, and the need for better gear that drives this game. The game is free to play but has several costs at the benefit of this. This game is more of a grind, dungeon, and building game.Reasons to Get the Game:The main reason for me was that it was FREE. As in no cost, but there is always a cost and item that requires you to pay the company who made trove. Examples are like Costumes, Different Mounts, and Loot Crates that help give you a type of Gambling feel into a game. The best part of the game is that it is one of the free games that include BUILDING. Building your own home from a simple house to a cool castle or tower makes the game more fun and better. If you have nothing to do I recommend to get the game and just try it out.Problems Regarding the Game:The problems regarding it is the INSANE level of grinding for better loot and in-game currency to make your character look at least decent. The next problem is the building area: The building are is not as big as you think it would be. So I recommend that before you start building plan accordingly to the size given and use it to your advantage. For Example, a tower would be good for the Building Space Provided.Overall Result:I recommend on trying the game out because it is a free-to-play game. It helps me have something to do when I have lost interest in other games.Rating: 6.5/10"

Many of the reviews already explain in depth why most people hate a certain feature/aspect.1. Paying for an expansion:More paid expansions to come I guess? Pay to play incoming.2. Classes:For a long time have always been unbalanced, some broken and took a while to be fixed. Devs are too invested on what to create next rather than fix what they already have. Strictly speaking of classes here, I'm sure there's other stuff they choose to neglect. Also you have to pay credits for classes now? I've seen games like this that become popular overnight and they care about the community and what not, take Payday 2 for example. ""Oh yeah we care about the community, DLCS free forever!"" -Payday2 Now I know Trove hasn't made such promise and that's fine but when it comes to changing CLASSES ingame from cubits to credits, that's just too much. I'm guessing at some particular point all people care about is money.3. End Game:The end game simply is just boring, I ended up getting to the end game pretty quick and towards the end I was just doing dailies.There are a few other things I dislike but it's just been a while and I've honestly just forgotten them. This game was great because I felt like the devs cared, they didn't throw much paid stuff in our faces in the past. Now it's just annoying, of course though they would disagree but who wouldn't defend something that they made. Just want to say the state Trove is in right now it just does not feel like the developers care, 2nd time saying it. Goodbye forever Trove."

,Recommended,304050,29491223,Posted: 25 January,all,Kierwynn,"Yes, I recommend this game... For your children.Its basically a dumbed down Minecraft, with limited crafting (recipe list), and the combat is RPG-lite. It lacks any and all depth, as a freshly created character can take on even the most challenging dungeons with nothing but holding down left click and pressing either 1 or 2 every few minutes.This is clearly designed for children, though I guess that should have been aparant from the intro movie.Really, its not a bad game, but it will never provide a challenge, or anything to *do* for an adult. So while I do recommend this game, the caveat to that is that its for your children.Keep in mind however, that they push the in-game cash shop pretty darn hard (as in pops up every logon, and as soon as you ""create"" your character."

76561198134838428,Recommended,304050,29708787,Posted: 4 February,all,UndeadNinja,"I do recommend the game it is really fun sadly i cant really make you believe me because of my 75 hours on the game but the thing is that i recomend this because i have played the game for a long and i mean a long time probably about 2 weeks it after it came out AKA when it wawsnt on steam so it doesnt show how much i know.But to begin with if you are reading this thank you for taking your time and if you are one of my creators i know you have been to my guild called mega freedom but i dont remember who and just wanted to say hai. So in general this game is really amazing. I have played this game for a long time a previously said but the game has changed a lot. Some of it in a cool/good waybut some if it in a really bad way.To begin with, the market was really cool because it gave people an easier way to get  some good stuff like instead of farming sunlight bulbs for an hour or 2 you can jsut go to the market and spend some flux and get some that way. But if you are like me who has♥♥♥♥♥♥loads of flux you can get even more money from it which is a downside and i say this becuase i am a victum of it and now say you wanted to buy sun light bulbs usually there like 10-15 flux a peice which isnt bad so thumbs up for that. NOW the down side is like i said if you like me and have a lot flux you can buy all of the sulight bulbs and then sell them for way more like 100 a peice because no one has it and wants it so they will buy some which you can miake big profit from this which now the rich get only richer and you can do this stuff for materials that are harder to obtain like a penta forge soul and then boost the price to 40k flux and people will buy it because some are desprate enough to buy them because they want a radient which is where i usually make money like that but differ items.On a good note though i like how they have added radient and stellar items becuase i thought they were really cool.  Now the bad note is if your new its going to be harder to get them because you need at least 600 magic find and thats the lowest to where if you're farming for about and hour you will get one radient and if lucky a stellar. On that note though lets talk about one of the biggest parts of trove.Power Rank, this is what gets you almost every where only for the reason of the the places you can go with 15k power rank or more becuase with out power rank you can get no good items like shadows and resplendent if you want to count those. But i only said that power rank takes you almost every where because you also need mastery rank just for some bonus items it can get you and i highly recommend that you take the time to learn about gems because a lot of new players miss out on gems and then wonder how to get power rank because in this game gems wil give you the most power rank and if you really want get to lvl at least 20 so you can use the special gems (forgot their names so sry people) and then spend money to get gem booster packs so the n you can get some good gems for your person and get some power rank. or farm up and just get the gems when you reach 550 power rank because at that pr you can do a shodow tower. With that if you kill daughter of the moon then you get some lunar souls which then you can make a gem booster and get a good gem(s).More down sides;-you have to pay for classes or just farm chaos chest for chaos cores-if your new then you will have a rough start (you can message me  if you need help but ill be playing with differ acount because its a good excuse to lvl up my oter chars on my other account)-carful of scammers when you trade best bet is to look in market and then from that see the normal pricing for the item then buy the cheapest ;]-farming flux can be really annoying for new people because they cant go in ubers 8/9 for good items to deconstruct-PvP is a little effy (my opion) love the banner idea though (nother note: it is really fun if you do guild PvP i do it a lot and it's really fun)Upsides-game is very fun in general-community is nice (most of the time)-there are some cool dragons now (sadly though getting dragon coin are a lil annoying)-getting to level 30 and having it said to everyone online feels great-the farming is really fun with friends and alone (biased a little)-the graphics are goodSome Tipstry to find a good and nice guild and make friends and they can help you get goodstart learning hot to garden in the game because it will help you a lot to get to mastery 20buy a boat so you can get over water fastanother good/easy way to get mastery points is to fishDO NOT DO SCROOL CRAFTING THING i say this because that is something you want to do whe n you get to mastery 200-299 because it will help you a lot when you get that farcarful where you go because say you have 5000 pwoer rank it will let you go to uber 8 which you are only level 13 or something you will die so stay in areas where your lvl is like uber 2/3 if you're lvl 13make friends on the game because if you do it will only get funnerStuff I missis when glim was actually useful i cry now becuase of itcant trade/sell chaos chesta big one is the old shadow towers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  these were the best because shadow towers used to be where you have to find them in the worlds of uber+ and have a shadow key and this made the game really fun becuase of when you found them you had a chance to get differ bossed. now sadly all you have to do is just get flux and boom you get a shadow tower and you can choose your boss. (but i do love that there are random mini dungeons that lead to the main boss)I could go on about this game but i've spent some time typing this and now my hands hurt so i hope you liked this and found this helpful and i also hope you arent a grammer nazi ;] just saying eheheheif you dont like the game im not here to force feed it down your throat you probably have other friends to do that ;P hope you have a good day and c ya"

Trust me nothing goes wrong with nutella.INGREDIENTS:1 c. unsalted butter2 c. sugar1/2 tsp. salt1 c. flour1 c. cocoa powder4 eggs1 (13-oz.) jar Nutella5 Ferrero Rocher candies, unwrapped and crumbledDIRECTIONS:1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.2. Melt butter in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar, stirring until combined. 3. Remove from heat and add salt, flour, and cocoa powder, stirring to combine. Whisk in eggs, stirring just until the mixture is combined into a batter. Set aside.4. Spray an 8""-x-8"" pan with cooking spray. Pour half of the batter into the pan. Spoon or lightly drizzle most of the Nutella on top of the batter, forming an even layer over the brownie batter. 5. 5. Use a spoon or silicone spatula to cover the Nutella with the remaining brownie batter. (If you pour the batter straight on top of the Nutella, it will sink into the Nutella and combine into one marbled—yet delicious—mess.)6. Bake until the top layer of brownies has browned and set, 28 to 30 minutes. It shouldn’t jiggle when you remove it from the oven. (The toothpick test doesn’t work here, since the toothpick will hit the Nutella layer, making the brownies seem uncooked.)7. Let cool for 15 to 20 minutes, then top with a drizzle of Nutella and crumbled Ferrero Rocher chocolates. Cut into squares and serve.Credits: ★ Billy"

If you are expecting Wow than its not with this game. If I could describe it, I would say its similar to minecraft with its building mechanic and style but the gameplay is almost completely different. You start off being able to choose about 15 different classes all with different abilities. You then get to go off into a randomly generated world with dungeons scattered everywhere. All you do is just beat them and level up,..thats about it...yes there are shadow dungeons and some different realms as well as a horrible pvp mode but thats it. It lacks in content and it starts to get extremly repetitive. The content they add is just pay 2 win mounts and wings. Yes, this game is a pay 2 win once you get past level 20. And even if you buy stuff, it just adds something better next week. This has brought the game down because they now care more about mounts which make a quick buk instead of adding actual content. It's a shame really and a dissapointment. I think the game is good but to repetitive and boring in the first 20 hours. Then its just grinding simulator. I would recommend this game but its just gotten worse over the past 2 years.6.5/10Fun at first but gets worse as you proceed"

But the game is not P2W. Everything is obtainable, spare a few cosmetic items from the store, for free to plays. You can be better than many P2P's while not spending any cash.My verdict - If you can bare, or even enjoy the grinding that this game takes, and set yourself goals, and be willing to sacrifice a lot of time, go for it, have fun. If you cannot, atleast try the game till you hit that slow point. It is a very good game, just slow, due to Trion's new money making schemes."

,Not Recommended,304050,29755071,Posted: 6 February,all,w o a h,"alright, before i get too far into this review, i want to make it clear that i absolutely love trove. it is easily one of the most fun games i have ever played, and i've made a lot of friends through it. absolutely in love with the level, costume, enemy and character designs.however...from the time i started playing trove to now, i've realized (with much disappointment) that it's basically a pay-to-play game at this point. not everyone can afford credits, cubits and what not. i totally understand the whole patreon thing, wanting to give certain fans access to some rare things here and there, but it feels like that is the absolute only way to make any real advancements or anything other than grinding and farming 24/7. everything, from credits and cubits to materials and costumes, should be more accessible than what they are now. im not saying to just hand things out, but jeez, don't make it to the point where we can't get any even slightly cool stuff without having to pay for it.i would have recommended trove a while back, but i won't recommend it now unless paying actual money for upgrades and outfits is your cup of tea."

,Recommended,304050,29734904,Posted: 5 February,all,NateyBoss,"I love the game but at times it can seem grindy and repetitive. Plenty of characters to play as, once you unlock or buy them, you can swap between them at any time. You get two free classes without much effort, more if you decide to refer a friend and use their class coin, but you must reach a high level to finally get it. The characters that are more advanced cost actual money but can be crafted if you're willing to put the time into it. Trove is essentially a grind game where you raid dungeons endlessly in open worlds and collect loot. When you reach a certain power level that increases with better loot, you can move onto a new world where you repeat the looting process, an endless loop of looting. If you like a game that feels rewarding, I can recommend this to you. Personally, this is my type of game. Despite the repetition, I enjoy putting time into it because it feels rewarding and your appearance changes with different loot so you don't always look the same. If you love what anything looks like, you can save its appearance and apply it to something different and keep its stats, I really enjoy that option. Plenty of interaction, each world has its own chat and there is a main hub where you can talk to people or find your friends and play together. You can also build your own home but within a limited square, the great part about this is you can transport your house anywhere you go for free. You can only spawn the home within squares that are randomly placed around every world. Only you can edit or destroy them. All interactable furniture placed inside of your home is usable by everyone, but it's personalized for them. Only you can access anything you have stored. There are trading stations but you have to be a very high level to use them, as for the player market."

Then levelling up becomes slower... and slower... and slower... and slower... you get it. The grinding in this game is brutal, and it doesn´t give you any rewards. When you try to clear a dungeon that is your level, every enemy DESTROYS you. The game tells you ""you are this level, so you should do this"", and then you find out you can´t because it´s extremely unbalanced. This game is impossible to play if you go solo, someone has to carry you. Or, you can pay... I'm not talking pay to win, cause its main mode is pve.

Those of you who remember Cube World will find this satisfying in a way you wanted that game to feel (although the movement is far more ""static"" and ""controlled"" in a sense as opposed to the float/glide feeling combat in that long-dead game. Not a bad thing at all, just a difference worthy of note and, frankly, an easier system to acclimate to if not quite as satifying).This is a good game, end of story. Flawed? Oh yeah. But, this game delivers one of the best experiences I've ever had in the voxel genre (not as complex in building as Minecraft nor combat as complex/satisfying as Cube World or Portal Knights, but more well rounded than either). Great game and worthy of your time.HOWEVER!!!!My account (yes, the one played and loved since EARLY alpha) ran into bizarre account security problems. The support I recieved was worse than non-existant. I threw a couple bucks there way (well earned, I can't lie) but it was hurtful having my account with such time/money investments taken from me and ZERO way of retrievale (believe me, I've tried 3 times to date and been essentially spat in the face for it by either automated replies or uncaring support staff). I remember being able to chat in-game with dev's during alpha, listening to world chat talking about shadow items before the name tier name of ""shadow"" was even implimented, but damn do I feel betrayed.I'd highly reccomend to anyone looking to have fun, especially with a friend or few, but if you want long term DO NOT INVEST. Loss of security or any similar problem will result in uncaring dismissal of your problem and believe me when I say that kills the enjoyment of what could be a great game. So, mixed bag review. Wish there was a ""sort of"" recommend option on steam for this exact case, but without I cannot reccomend to anyone who (like me) loves investing themselves into a game."

DMG to enemies doesn't seem to register until up to 2 seconds after it is dealt. I know it isn't my internet because I have a 20mbps connection. I think the servers are just in a constant state of being overwhelmed and Trion doesn't use any of that money they get from all of the pay to win bull♥♥♥♥♥♥they put in the game to fix them.
