Even worst, if you guess wrongly, you lose the game.I guess it is really like a reality game where you have to guess the preference of the judges, but it does not feel super hero worthy at all.Unlike the first game where I get the feeling of actually giving my super hero a personality, this one seems to be about making random choice with unknown consequence again and again."

If you've played that and liked it, you'll like this one.  If you didn't, then you won't like this one either.  Both are too linear for my tastes, though to be fair the writing in this one has improved somewhat."
,Recommended,304290,10791023,"Posted: 25 June, 2014",all,Lady Lilah,"Considering the price (I got it for 4 euros), I really enjoyed this. Actually, I paid 4 euros for ""The Hero Project"" and ""The Prodigy"", but I had mistaken the order and played ""The Hero Project"" first.It took me around 4 hours or so to finish, but it was quite a nice 4 hours. It's definitely not an A-list story, I'd expected a bit more and it did end rather abruptly, but it's quite a nice little thing.I've wasted more money on A-list games that provided less entertainment. If you want a nice little distraction, get it. If you're hard to please, go write your own damn book."
,Not Recommended,304290,15321632,"Posted: 12 April, 2015",all,Milky,"So, after my disappointment with The Prodigy, I was set to never touch this series again - once I had gone back and finished it, of course. A family member assured me I was wrong and that the series got better in The Hero Project - to their credit, they were right.However, even in that case, THP barely struggles to make *average*. The writing style continues to be quite sophomoric and not in the entertaining sense of being young. It's sophomoric in the sense of awkward phrasing, juvenile handling of sex and bizarre, immersion-shattering rants about correct gender pronouns. It's immature and banal. Look, I get that more games should deal with sex and gender, and I get that interactive fiction is one of the best genres for it, but Zachary Sergi needs to handle it with a bit more deftness. Credit for attempting it.To Sergi's additional credit, there are some interesting choices in this game. I thought many of the ones relating to Null and Lucky were quite good and hard to choose from. Unfortunately, much like the previous entry in the series, THP suffers from the stark feeling of being stuck on rails with an author that's waiting to jump out and go 'aha!' at you for not picking the right choice (while giving you no indication of what might be the right choice unless you *pay for it as an in-game app store-esque purchase*. THP, however, seems to have less of those ridiculous options like The Prodigy had (infilrating and forgetting to take off your hero costume, anyone?) - so, that's some improvement. But it's still not embracing the strength of an interactive medium because good IF rewards choices and does its best to disguise the rails (eg; Choice of Robots).Much of the worldbuilding and setting continues to be a bit on the nose - again, it's very sophomorric. The fact that Sergi continues to interject 'slugger' into so many sentences as a catch all term that seems to be a general epithet, noun, verb, adjective and so on is lazy. Honestly, if there is one thing I could remove from this whole trilogy, it's this word. As a whole, the world feels very derivative of superhero comics and doesn't offer much in the way of originality.For a simple premise (superhero reality TV) the plot has too many characters (of course, expecting you to remember/care about all of them) and a slow development where things just seem to happen. I'm not sure how much control over my story I actually had, thanks to the aforementioned of feeling like I'm on rails. What's worse, is that the characters aren't particularly likeable - again, due to the writing style.So, what's good about it? Well, there's a fair bit of customisation. If you're looking to feel like you're in a superhero story and you want a bit of a self-insert fantasy where you can craft your dreamworld to exacting specifications then this is for you. If you want something that advances the medium of IF, offers interesting, branching choices with clever writing and wit - avoid. As someone who looks for the latter, I cannot recommend THP.Additionally, I ran into a bug near the end that caused me to need to restart my entire story. I won't mark the game down for that but it was quite unfortunate."

It had a potenital to be a lot better, but unfortunately the myriad of missed opportunities and obvious ""plot twists"" bog it down to be a passable game, 3/5 in my book.If you are into teenage superhero fantasy, than you might actually like this one.However, if like me you prefer something more mature and serious, than I suggest you buy ""Choice of Robots"" by the same developer instead. A far better experience, as far as I am concerned."

Some people may point to the fact that the game is linear and that occasionally your choices may make you feel ""Boxed In"", however, the choices presented to you are great enough and of a large enough depth that you may deviate from the main story arc and play the kind of hero you may want to play, however you will soak the fallout for whatever decisions you might choose.In short; the game is good, and gives you more entertainment than expected of a game with such a small pricetag.Oh, and if you have the few extra units of whatever currency you possess, buy the bundle or the perfect legend guide + warning system. They help in the long run."

,Recommended,304290,24100461,"Posted: 4 July, 2016",all,almacher,"A well-written, engaging game, as was the first in the trilogy (The Prodigy). My one criticism is that in this installment there were rather more characters, some rather sketchily-defined, and this made it hard to keep straight who was who. This confusion affected my ability to make choices consistent with a chosen strategy throughout the game. I think The Hero Project could benefit from a non-spoilery ""Quick Who's Who"" link accessible from any point in the game."

I'm leaving this same review on each of the Trilogy pages because it's an across the board review of 5 out of 5 or 108 out of 100 or A++ or whatever you can think of.This has been one of the most emotional, roller-coastering rides of my life, and it happened in a videogame. One that's entirely text-based. You start off as a little hero still trying to figure out who you are and you end as a big one, no matter what path you take, knowing exactly who you are. You'll go through so many ups and downs and surprises and disappointments and happiness and sadness and successes and failures, you'll get into all the great beat em up action that comes with being a hero and all the baggage and consequences, too. But if you stick to who you are, just like in life, you'll pull through and make the right calls, and become a legend. The fate of the world is in your hands. The fate of your world is in your hands. Now get to it. And buy this trilogy."

There are a few minor gripes I have here or there regarding the outcome of the game, but all in all it was a fun story to play through and simple without losing the actual game aspect of an Interactive Fiction Game.  Basically, if you enjoyed the Lone Wolf or Fighting Fantasy series despite the frequent nonsensical deaths rather than because of them, this is a game you'll like.  Good value for the money."
76561198047811576,Recommended,304290,11324263,"Posted: 19 July, 2014",all,BlackRoseFFX,"This game is much like the first in the series, and you can play it without paying the first one but I wouldn't recommend it. After the fame generated from Prodigal and her Deathwave, you are trying to find a way to keep your legend level high. Your best idea to do this is to join a reality TV show called the Hero Project, which the top six winners will join a team of superheroes supported by the government. Black Magic, Jury, Mayor Victon, Jenny, and your Grandmother all make appearances. You can continue your relationship with Black Magic, if your were in one, or you can start a relationship with Jenny or another Hero named Lucky. Black Magic is pretty jerky in this one, so I went with Lucky, who is sweet. At the end you can import your save file into the third game, which some of the romances in the third one require the romance to have been completed in this game. Also you do not have to import a save file from the previous game and you can start fresh.Some of the bad things were: you cannot save and load in the game, so if you do not like a choice you made, you are stuck with it, the legend guide that you unlock isn't that helpful, they could have added more achievements, and sometimes it was hard to tell how a choice would affect your stats. Overall it is a good game that is well written. Some complain about ending up at the same place regardless of the choice you make, but that is sort of the point to keep the story moving, and it being written out. Sometimes you'll unlock scenes you didn't see on a previous playthough."

As the 2ed game in the trilogy it  provided the needed bridge in the narrative but I will  be honest:Going full hero path basically messed up both teams in the story. Still going to replay as a villain at some point because there are so many avenues from this game into the 3rd that I want to see how everything ends. Just pick up all 3 games as a collection. You wont be dissapointed. Its like City of Heroes meets Text based RPG.

76561197998113892,Recommended,304290,10985176,"Posted: 30 June, 2014",all,Majorshepard,"Here are my thoughts and feelings about Heroes Rise: The Hero Project. (Spoilers ahoy)The GoodThe story is even better than the last one, with twists and turns that will keep you guessing on your first time playthrough. It has a feeling to it that really gets you tense and pumped up for what happens in the story.The characters have varying types of personalities and most have semi-realistic personalities.The BadEven though the story is better this time round it has even more problems than the last one. While the first one felt linear it wasn't glaringly obvious, unlike in this one. Never before have I felt that the choices I made had no impact to the game. Everything I did just felt like poking a wall, it changed nothing. No matter what you do you will ALWAYS get as far as the final eliminations and all that changes is how the ending starts off.Although I said most characters feel semi-realistic it is not the MAIN characters that feel that way, tis the side characters. Jenny has a ""My way or the high way"" attitude and she will force you to leave the competion just so she can do her investigation, even though she clearly states that you are also apart of it and can continue it without her. However you never can and don't even get the option to look into it YOURSELF!Black Magic has a complete personaltiy reversal! In the first game he/she is kind, caring and can be a bit forceful in her methods. But overall she/he is a good person. In this story she becomes narcisitic, confrontational, manipulative and even cruel. She/he goes out of her way to stay in the competition and will pit you against another potential love interest, even if you say that you aren't interested in her/him.Rexford is played like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like ALL the obvious bad guys are, its like the writer didn't even try to hide the fact he's the bad guy. His stat is useless and changes nothing so don't even try to pander to him.The UglyIn the last review I said that the choices were biast to one specific style of play, going for the ""Correct"" options. For example saving a reporter or your Sidekick, saving the reporter was seen as only wanting fame and saving your Sidekick was the ""Hero"" way. In this story its even worse, as the types of play actually have catergories now! Which makes them even more narrow minded than before! It makes it feel like you are meant to play the game ONE way and if you try to do it another way prepare for so many penalties you'll feal like Oliver Twist asking for more food. ""CHOICES?! How dare you ask to be different and do things your way! GET BACK TO MY WAY OR GET OUT!"". Why can't you get the teams to work together to get Culic or save the people in the Tunnel? Why is stoping Culic, a Leader of super-Terrorists, consider pandering to fame when stoping him there might stop the current attack AND save lives!? Why do you always get low scores when you actually perform the best you can actually do at a trial?! The max points you can get is 90 when doing a team training trial and even if you get perfect scores for each you will always be at the bottom! So you are forced into the situation of either leaving the finals or outing your friend to get further in the competition. Why can't I actually get past this with good points?! Even though I got my Gold key at the near the start I still come at the bottom, exactly the same outcome if you take the longer ""Correct"" way! What the hell is this?!There's also the fact that most of the statistics for stats and relationships don't matter for most of the characters it shows! Rebellion's stat does nothing, Rexford's Stat does nothing, and Grandma's stat does NOTHING! Why are they even there if it changes nothing story wise, gameplay wise, or even freaking conversation wise?! What's the point of the Control and Unleash guage when going either way does NOTHING! Being in complete control of your powers does nothing, so if you think it means that when you use you Infini powers it isn't as bad as if you didn't. You will ALWAYS fail at evacuating everyone at the Castle with infini powers.ConclusionsThis is meant to be a Text adventure GAME, but it really just feels like a story with slight variations in what happen. If you have played text games you should now that it has much more freedom in what you can do and actually feel like you choices matter. Here its just a story with fake options that do nearly nothing.Overall even though this game is better than the last it has even more problems that nearly negate every gain it has made. Even though I reccommend this game I still caution you on buying it. If you like it when most of the control you get does nothing and only want to see a story play out then by all means buy this. But if you want a Text adventure GAME than I'm afraid this isn't up to snuff yet.Personal score: 6/10"

There's a dude who is of a race that has no specific gender and insists on different pronouns. Maybe that's a cool sci-fi concept. Who knows, because that just leads to a whole scene that is a pointless sexuality argument. Thanks guys. I think you're in the wrong genre.Still, that's one scene. A good work otherwise. A marked improvement over the previous game. Branching paths, multiple styles of play. The first lacked a lot of agency. This one has some clever choices and tricks here and there and a sense of genuine mystery; it's more about the politics of the reality show than heroing but I was not truly impressed with the first game's heroing so it evens out. It's still a CYOA book but a pretty decent one.Besides, it's $3 and I know you're gonna get it on the cheap. Don't even lie. I've bought worse (And better) CYOAs for $5-10. It's worth your time.

I assumed that the romantic aspect of it was just going to be strained a bit maybe, but instead it seemed to just end it....OH! duh, one more thing. It would be WONDERFUL to have some kind of temorary save option at the end of each chapter or at least at the end of each 'PART'(part1, part 2, part3) so that you DON'T have to restart if you accidentally touchscreen the wrong option or misread a name. (suspect im a bit dislexic since I got rex and victons names mixed up for about 5 pages at the end of the story....)All in all, even though I've probably restarted my game at least 20 times and redone the first 8 chapters so many times that I could do it blindfolded in order to redo an important decision that I didnt realize was THAT important, I still reccomend this game to anyone who has even a passing interest in DC, Marvel or Choose your own Adventures."

While the writing is still fun, and I still like the characters, suddenly the story branching points are less about the actual heroing and more about the petty politics of a Survivor style reality TV show. Presumably, this story is more mutable by the player as a result, but I found the choices to be less exciting.Ultimately, I would still recommend this title because it is an entertaining super-powered romp with a really, really fun climax.

This game is almost twice as long as the previous game, and its writing quality has only improved, as well as being more in depth too, there are a bunch of relationships in this game, and favouring one will displease the other, trying to please everyone is an incredibly hard path to take and may earn you more enemies than anything elseFantastic game at a really good price, if you're a fan of the first, definitely check it out, if you thought the first game was lacking somewhat, then this one might change your mind on the series since its better in practically everyway.

It has all the things that made the first installment great - however it ends on a cliffhanger.This all by itself would not be that bad but I went through the in-game store to buy the third and last chapter. This is where my nightmare started.Although I don't own it on steam, I do own herofall on the website. When I bought it, herofall wasn't on steam yet, so I didn't think it would be a big deal if I purchased ahead of time - many other games support you if you go through their website, in fact most games I know actually prefer that you do it that way since they get more from you directly and don't have to pay anything to steam. However because the game is not on steam I cannot continue my character from the first and second game - this defeats all the effort I put into my character from both games. I contacted them figuring it would be an easy enough fix to move a save file or something, but after weeks of back and forth emails it breaks down to me needing to start all over if I want to play herofall.I chose all my decisions carefully from the first and second game and to hell if I can remember all of them, nor do I want to sit through both games clicking forever to get to the same spot again. The only other option I have is to buy the game again through steam but I am really against buying a game I already own. It's not like a PS game that I own that I want on the PC, it's a computer game I own that I want on my computer... and I can't have it.Now that Herofall is on steam I DO recommend buying the entire pack or just the first game if your hesitant. Definitely avoid the in-game option of buying it though."

It is extremely well written, with complex characters (some aspects chosen by you the player, in how NPC's are described) and motivations which affect how the story goes into the sequel as well. I actually became quite attached to my character, and replayed the game if I ever made a gaffe I didn't like. (Sometimes I was cursing myself for making silly mistakes, other times I wanted to explore various choices and see there effects).Two issues I have to disagree with in a small critique. Choices concerning saving lives or taking them ought to trump any ideology your character pursues.  There are instances in the game where your choices are locked into one decision or another based on previous choices your character has made. I disagree with this aspect, and hope the author will fix such issues to open the life/death choices in the novel to either choice regardless of chosen path.The 2nd issue involves the first, and I'm not quite sure if this is a bug, since I was unable to save game at midpoints. I suppose saving games midstory would detract from the choices one, but it really would be nice if that feature were available, so that I wouldn't have to restart each game from scratch to explore various choices.Otherwise, I really enjoyed the series, and again, for $4.00 got a lot of hours of gameplay in. Seeing as I usually rate games based upon how much the cost per hour I play, I'd say this interactive novel is easily a 10/10."

,Recommended,304290,14097123,"Posted: 21 January, 2015",all,Yamaikazi,"I recommend this adventure right off the back because if you played Prodigy, then you will want to continue ""your"" story. It took me awhile to get used to the writing style in these stories, as it doesn't feel exactly like a ""choose your own"" kind of story. Some of the reactions from ""My"" character feels closer to watching a character, instead of controlling myself. This adventure takes you into a reality TV show for superheroes, though I'm not sure I would want any of these heroes saving me.One of the biggest issues I have with ""my"" adventures up to now are the romantic options. Maybe spoilers, but the romantic choices suck. At least, during my adventure they have. I think the writing overall was better then the first story, I wasn't pulled out of my adventures as much as I was in Prodigy. After seeing where Prodigy took the storyline, I was extremely curious to see where the next adventure took me. I'll be honest, I was a little disappointed with a reality show setting, but after finishing the adventure I can at least see why it was chosen.Some of the most important choices during my adventure though felt emotionally powerful, but it wasn't always my emtions that were moved. As I had mentioned, sometimes I'm watching this lead hero react not in a way I would have in the same position. Also, with the given choices, more then a few times during combat I feel like there is no gray area between ""nuclear bomb"" and ""don't move"". When this occurs, I tend to take into account how angry I am at the target, or how serious they have attacked me.Overall, I would say I enjoyed this adventure and where it might lead too, even if it was a little obvious from the begining. I was never really invested into the reality show's antics, and I was so unwittingly thrown into the event that I was completely suspicions of the thing the entire time. Though, I never really had an option to express this feeling. How much love will I find next, i'm starting part 3 now!"

Not as great as the original so far, but still pretty good. So I'm figuring you've already played 1 if you're reading the review for 2. Have you? No? Too bad I'm telling spoilers for the first game anyways. So as the competition started in this weird reality tv show thing. My character imported from the last game and named Metal Man a comic I made on this comic website before I took writing classes. I was with my lover Black Magic and we were gonna do this together. The first challenges were easy, I recklessly went through them in a flash. As it went on though they got harder and I met new heroes along the way, and I met a long lost girlfriend from hero camp, which her name will be disclosed do to the evil called spoliers. So basically I was still heads over heels with Black Magic, so I said ""Get out da' way b*tch"" at the time. Than I actually started to have feelings for her and Black Magic at the same time I was torn and not knowing what to do, I had also just made an alliance with two beginner heroes. Not knowing how the f*ck the voting system worked i thought giving them votes would help them stay on the show and helping these young aspiring heroes become stars or a vigilante like me. I accidentally voted one off and the other had a vendetta for me basically, I really felt bad and did the other challenges which were getting harder from me not focusing and the guilt overwhelming me as the next elimination sequence was coming. What the f*ck do I do? Black Magic my love says I have to vote childhood girlfriend off, or she'll break up with me. Then childhood girlfriend is like ""Don't abandon me a**hole remember me? I was your first kiss."" Of course I remember your a** you were my first kiss. I was given an option to vote off both, childhood girlfirend, or Black Magic. I was litterally sweating what was I going to do, I knew Black Magic so well and my character loved her, but childhood girlfriend was also very dear to his heart with him knowing her since childhood. So I came to the decision to boot off childhood girlfriend. After that I was strucken withe more guilt. Taking off beginners left and right, like they were babies it didn't feel right. I spent the rest of the night with Black Magic with something ringing in my mind. ""Did I make the right choice?"" I was also put in chrage of multiple heroes in the group I chose when I eliminated my first beginner. I took down multple heroes on tema two using tactics including Black Magic and another guy with metal bending or whatever the f*ck power it was. I was then pressured to use steroids so I said f*ck no. Apparently that b*tch Jessica from the last game dressed up in a costume and litterally turned full bada** for no literal reason. No training, it was only a year or two after the first game... so yeah, the game kinda pulled ""She's a bada** now, so just deal with it."" So I was like okay and jacked off for a lot of the other sections of the game until a decision came. Do I rat out Jenny because she's undercover (It's okay because none of you know her name so it's no spoiler, well it kinda is. Bah, f*ck it.) or do I stick up for her and be a ""good friend."" By giving up all my hopes and dreams. So I make the obvious choice of not being a tattletale because we're totally in first f*cking grade and I've been eliminated from the competition. So uh yeah. Kinda f*cked up there. Did it ever occur to you that I'm a swearaholic? So I still lve wth my grandma for now with my me thingy named Winston. Than dun-dun-dun somebodies elected president that is bad, seriously just guess, I won't say his name but if your not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or have short term memory loss you'll know. Also have I mentioned my character has been going insane lately, it should be obvious. But I'm disgusted by his new found victory, so like a 2 year old who still doesn't have his apple juice I whine about it. I also whine about how Black Magic is in a coma because this one a**hole as pissy fit on the battlefield. But as my character slowly turns evil and down this dark unsettling tunnel I decide I'm ready to move on from Black Magic for, she may never wake up from this coma. I then see Jenny and along with the five other winners win leaving a pit of regret in my stomach, wishing I could be the one in first place not her, but sadly I sacrificed everything to help the b*tch who had no powers. So I'm forced away to a concentration camp for infi-powered people by Mr. President, it's also mandatory. They might as well start calling us Jews. So I have a pissy fit myself and destroy the machine myself starting to realize how different I've become since this all began, how I used to pretend to be some sort of Batman, but now I'm starting to look more like this moral sponge which soaks up his own morals and others and spits them out as he abides to no laws modern men will give him. For I am a sponge, designed to soak up oragnge juice and be rubbed against someone's a** cheeks. Jenny was right the beautiful b*stard The Hero Project was in cahoots with infi haters, with it's crosshairs on me. For now, I must stand and fight. For now I must rebel. I must take off this villain mask I think I've been becoming, and show my real face, a bigger and better vigilante. Wintry, Summit, Stage Show, Rebellion, Judy, and Inherit are all coming to take me down, luckily I have Jenny on my side. 2v7, bring it on. I take out the guards and suddenly fumble and childhood girlfriend appear to help me? They say they're on my side so I'm like, maybe I can hook up with Lucky after all and now it's a 4v7 fight, again bring it on. After taking down all but 1 and that is Rexford, which appeared from nowhere he shoots an enegery blast the dampens powers, afraid that Jenny could die from the blast I must be a hero, I jump in front of the blast dampening my infini powers in the process. Everything goes white and I resume the story a while later, my powers weakened but not taken away, and it could be permanent, but I'm guessing it won't. I'm seen as a vigilante icon around the world just how I like it. But that doesn't mean my journey's over. Oh no, I still have the Victon's to worry about. For we're at war."

You can just jump right in if you choose to without losing too much of the backstory.Comparisons aside, the elements that make up the Hero Project are dynamic and feature several themes.

You end up participating in a reality TV show that grants its winners the positions of forming an USA-backed national superhero group. This Choose Your Adventure game adds more elements that can be affected by the way you treat your powers, how you treat others and so on.It's definitely a step up in comparison to the first installment in terms of length and all the stuff you need to keep up with, and despite its departure from your average superhero tail, the game offers tons and tons of plot twists and dramatic turns that keep you engaged and intrigued to the very end."

But it was a bit linear with kind of a straight storyline. Not very many story twists or turns but it really left a big impression on me as a choose your own adventure style of game. Would buy again."

In fact, a number of choices had me stressing out for approximately twenty minutes deciding which way to lean; not even a Bioware game has ever done this to me.  Play and read it.  You'll be glad you did."

Flush with your successes from the previous game, you take part in a reality tv show to form America's next great Supers Team. Much like Slammed, this game has betrayal, scandal, fame, and public opinion as major themes.The twists towards the latter half were interesting as well. It's also the first and only of the three that I faced a game-over in."

I personally had to restart two or three times because of some of the choices I made and immediatley regretted. This game has a very interesting spin on the super-hero genre that was very refreshing to see. Totally worth the low, low price."

Doomsday went out and got ice cream, then the ice cream melted... and everybody has super powers. Long story short, you're going to need napkins becuase this game is going to get messy. You should probably add sprinkles because why would you not make something so good... even better."

I definitly thought it was going to make the (already pleasantly campy) story a little TOO cheesy.I ended up acting as bat-sh*t crazy as any of those reality TV stars in real life: ""BUT if I choose, Becky, she might backstab me and vote me!!! But will be BFF be mad at me if I choose her over my BF? I'm not here to make friends, I'm here to WIN!""Whether it's a case of human-nature or of good story development, I was actually quite gripped. Without giving away too many spoilers, you also gradually learn the gravity of your choices and the show/situation to the greater public.Also I got to bang Robert Pattison. 10/10 will shame-bonk vampire♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥again."
