,Recommended,304350,11293501,"Posted: 17 July, 2014",all,The Rock Star Space Ferret,"The best zoo-tycoon game in my opinion. The WP series features heavily on realism, unlike the Zoo Tycoon series, although that series is good too. Animals look realistic, as are their AI behavior. It takes a while for babies to be born, unlike ZT where it apparently happens instantly. Food don't magically appear out of thin air to feed your animals. like in ZT. You need to place the proper facilities to make the food.WP 2 also focuses more on those rare/unknown animals, unlike ZT where they feature mostly well known/popular animals. I like this idea, because it lets people who play this game learn about animals they've never seen/or read about before. For example, there's the frilled sharks from the marine expansion. I doubt many people who aren't shark fans would know what they are.The map isn't really set up like a grid (ZT again). You simply 'paint' the paths along the ground for your customers to walk on, which makes your zoo look more realistic if you're using stone or dirt paths for instance.One thing I do like in ZT over WP2 though is setting up your habitats for marine animals. It's very easy to do in ZT but I find it frustrating to do the same in WP2.Both zoo series are good, but if you want more realism in a zoo game, then WP2 is the way to go. With 150+ animals, realistic AI, along with loads of plants and attractions, etc, however, you should buy it anyway."

I got the game on a sale with all the expansions, which gives cracking value and a really vast amount of content for the money.The very real question is whether or not this game is better than Zoo Tycoon, which is a tough one to answer.Zoo Tycoon 2 is without question more polished, less buggy and very enjoyable to play.However, Wildlife Park has masses of content, is cheaper, has more flexibility and an engaging realism.In short, they are two quite different games so compliment each other quite well. I would definitely recommend getting the expansion packs for this as they are quite spectacular. On the whole I'd strongly recommend this and with some bug fixes it would probably beat Zoo Tycoon 2."

Now I like it even more with the amount of content when the (very inexpensive) expansions/DLC were bought and added.The landscaping tools allow you to make a very detailed park as far as habitat and such goes. However some of the tools are labelled oddly. I suppose in other games I am used to the 'flatten' tool when in this game it's called 'plateau' but it does the same thing, bringing everything up/down to the same level and flat. A little finicky sometimes as it can be difficult to make a nice small pond in enclosures for drinking/swimming (sometimes there's not enough of a flat spot to put the water pump in so you have to mess around a bit). And the different types of turf are marked by hardness which is a little weird to me. I know some of the species of animals would like certain trees in their exhibits from their country of origin but the animals and trees can be dissatisfied trying to share the same turf type. I don't like the whole bit about micro managing the foliage of the park on top of the animals. That feels a little awkward.Graphics are actually pretty decent, less cartoony than ZT 2 and (sadly) Wildlife Park 3. I am personally okay with the vast majority of them. Though I have one bug (not sure if anyone else gets this) where animals or people randomly turn invisible. They're still there and sometimes I find them by accidentally clicking on them. But you can't see them. You can see the 'meh' yellow smiley over their heads if they're somewhat unimpressed.I do hate that the staff all have their own building, and you have to strategically place said buildings to get the most work out of your employees. The buildings take up valuable real estate that could instead be used for decoration or more exhibit space. On the plus side, the workers are pretty dedicated and no major complaints about them, in my humble opion. It would also be nice if they combined several of the staff into 'the Maintenance guy'. Gardener/Handyman/Bin Man could probably be the same dude since their work tends to be more infrequent.I love the animal selection, though the Swiss Brown Cow is perm-invisible for me for some reason. You can create fairly interesting combinations of beasts for the most part, for mixed compatible exhibits.Overall I'd have to rate this game (with all extra content) an 8/10 and if they make a 4th game and don't fudge it up like the 3rd one, I'll be the first to flail and yell ""Shut up and take my money!"""

76561198014704153,Recommended,304350,14473696,"Posted: 14 February, 2015",all,WolfauraRose,"I've always liked simulation type games and looking after animals, this game is done very well.I love how you can build your zoo from scratch and look after the animals and name them and watch them from close up or above.And the graphics look quite good.Though I dislike that each staff member has their own building, to me that is silly and takes up too much space.  It ends up looking rather ugly having these tall staff buildings every where. There should be 1 major staff building for the animal workers and another building for the maintenance staff. And you can employ how ever many staff you need from each building and then asign to them a task or area for them to work. I did work experience at a zoo when I studied land management and the staff get to other areas around the zoo by bicycle or use a ute or other vehicle if needing to transport stuff.I also dislike that you have to look after and watch the plants needs. That is not fun and I think it's unneeded. The plants should be alive but just classed as a decoration you don't have to look after like what they did in sims 3. Or at the very least I'd rather not have plants tell me they aren't happy and just have a gardener smart enough to look after them himself. So that I wont have to deal with the strangeness of plants telling me they aren't happy.I also can't figure out how to properly build a water habitat. The game never shows you how to. I end up flooding everything or when I try to lower the ground more I end up with the water deep down the bottom and a massive cavern at the top. Iam not likely to buy the marine world DLC as I hate building marine habitats they always work out wrong. With you having to make a big hole and put a pump in and the water never fills up to the top and it looks ugly.And underwater viewing tunnels don't work properly either.When you build it you have one of two options.. you can either build a one-way line into the pool which ends underwater, or build a true tunnel with two exits.If you opt for one-way visitors enter your tunnel but exit underwater and then swim in enclosure heedless of risk; and then start getting angry because they are stuck.If you opt for two-way the tunnel acts like an invisible barrier preventing any animals from crossing sides - effectively cutting your pool in half. I did not test to see if this barrier prevents attacks by one species on another. But I did test and proved that they would rather starve to death than go get food just 2m on other side of the under water tunnel. Further animals begged for fellows if split up by a tunnel but don't if both on same side of it. And this barrier effect remained true no matter how deeply underwater the tunnel was placed and how shallow the animal's swim parameters were.Could be more educational and have descriptions of the animals. Eg. Cheetah: a large feline of the felidae family which inhabits most of Africa and parts of Iran. It is the fastest land animal. It likes to hunt antelope etc.I am likely to get most of the DLC eventually, except marine or horses as don't like marine habitat building and just horses in a dlc seems boring to me.Despite the things I dislike this game overall is fun and enjoyable to play. I recommend it and give it 7/10.It would of been an 8 but loses a point for things I dislike. Maybe If they make a much improved Wildlife Park 4 they'll make this one worthy of an 8 or higher."

For children it is a definate thumbs up as that is the obvious target audience.  The game leads you by the hand every step of the way and the controls are extremely basic.  For adults it is a thumbs down for the same reasons.  Missions get repetative and boring, animations are the same as the controls, basic, and even for a game released in 2006 not good enough to satisfy the older gamer.  Another turn off is that even the plants appear to be sentient and tell you why they are not happy which again, is good for kids but not for adults.  My four year old loves the game but my six year old prefers ZT2, as do I.  make of that what you will.I should also point out that the expansions do not appear to blend seamlesly with the original game but are rather stand alone products.  i bought the ultimate edition and have 7 seperate games to play, all of which have their own settings etc."

In fact, had I known about these issues, I wouldn't have bought the game.  The main issue is that the expansions do not act as DLC.  They act as their own seperate games.  They show up individually in your library.  The base game does not contain missions or maps from the expansions.  In order to play with those, you have to start up that specific expansion.  However, the animals from the expansions seem to show up almost randomly between each other.  For example, the base game appears to have almost all of the animals (fish, dinos, dragons, etc) but appears to be missing certain specific species.  The expansions have the same issue; having certain species and not others.  You can fool around in the program files and condense most of everything into the base game but you will still be missing stuff.  And, I must point out, the animal color customization button in the base game doesn't work.As for the actual game itself, it is alright.  There are aspects of it that are annoying (each employee has their own individual giant fugly tower, there isn't much variety in animal enrichment items, there aren't many items for guests, etc) but overall if you're looking to play something mindless for a while, Wildlife Park 2 isn't the worst choice.  It is certainly not as enjoyable as Zoo Tycoon, however, and if you're looking for an exciting, challenging simulation game, I would not choose this."
,Recommended,304350,32136010,Posted: 2 June,all,Beelzeboss,"*Skip to Pros & Cons if you don't wanna read through the wall-of-text.Let me start by saying that I love this game. I never knew about this game before. The only zoo game I played is Zoo Tycoon series, but unfortunately it does not work well with modern OS. On the other hand, Wildlife Park 2 works flawlessly on Windows 10 OS.Since there aren't really that many zoo-building games, people tend to compare this to Zoo Tycoon. Yes I agree, this isn't as polished as Zoo Tycoon 2. But Wildlife Park 2 has it's own unique characteristics. If it had all the things that ZT2 had, then it would've been another copy-cat game. Wildlife Park 2 not only focuses on making a nice and beautiful zoo but also on the 'Management' part of the zoo. You can't just only monitor the satisfaction of animals. You also have to keep an eye on what the visitors want; even the trees aren't mere decorations and need to be taken cared of.  Compared to ZT2 and many other zoo games, the animals in Wildlife Park 2 have very realistic behaviors. There are many small and silly but fun details in this game. For example - If you don't place enough restrooms, visitors will find a bush or tree and use that instead; if you make small ponds, then animals can just drink from there; some ducks and butterflies also appear if you place many trees and make a pond which I only noticed in the Fantasy expansion but not in the base game though; some animals can also eat from certain trees to fulfill their hunger, etc. These small features aren't important, but these make the game look interesting. Graphics are a bit dated but not that bad, considering how old this game is. If you decorate your park well enough, it would look beautiful enough if you keep the camera max zoomed out. There are few bugs as well but they are not major. Campaign mode is basically a through tutorial that will teach you how this game works through each mission.Here's a list of things that, in my opinion, this game does well and the things it does poorly -Pros -+Variety of animals. With the Ultimate Edition, this game has a lot of animals to offer and the Fantasy expansion even provides mythical creatures.+Not really a casual game that focuses only park building. You have to build AND manage everything in the park.+Animal AI is very realistic.+Small but fun details that make the game interesting.+Zooming in really close makes the camera to go on a first-person mode, enabling you to roam through the park like a visitor.+The ability to see detailed information of animals either individually or everything together. This also works on trees, employees and visitors.+Weather effects.+Decent animal models and textures.+Smiley appears above anything in the park that needs attention, which helps you notice any problem your park is having. If the smileys bother you much then there is a button at the bottom part of the UI that turns on and off this feature.+Does not try to copy anything from other games. Has it's own unique features.Cons --Music is annoying and repetitive.-Most of the time you won't hear many sounds if you are zoomed out, other than the weather effect or the sound that plays when your facilities make profits. Overall, it feels silent if you turn off the music.-Items and building have no sorting options.-Not many buildings to place.-Weather changes make animals and visitors unhappy all at once. Only way I've found to deal with this situation is to build as many shelters and tents as possible.-Employees of the Park have their own building to function. You have to place different types of buildings to get the workers. They don't work properly if you happen to place something outside their work area so you will have to place another building.-Minor bugs-Making profit isn't very challenging.If you love management/tycoon games, ignore the comparison people make of this game to ZT2 and play this game for whatever it is, then you will love this.My personal rating - 7/10"
,Not Recommended,304350,14760359,"Posted: 6 March, 2015",all,Kalora,"I'm going to start off by saying that I really wanted to like this game.  I read through all the reviews before making my purchase and even though there were negative ones, I decided I'd find out for myself exactly how horrible this game really is.  Well, I've come to realize that it's not horrible, but it's not great either.  It's just okay.I have always loved zoo builders and for some reason there's a serious shortage of them out there, so Zoo Tycoon 1 and 2 is pretty much up against Wildlife Park 1, 2, and 3.  I have played both the Zoo Tycoon games avidly and I hold it very dear to my heart, despite its discontinuation.The Good-1) I love the amount of animals, but also the amount of out-of-the-box type of animals that came with the DLCs.  I liked the farm animals, the domestic animals, and the animals that are kind of used as ""decoration"" (Ducks, Butterflies, etc).2) The graphics are nice.3) I liked the animations of the people and animals.4) Unique buildings that are animal themed like horse stables.The Bad-1) Graphics are buggy.  When I started my game up, I instantly saw black squares in place of some plants.  It went away when I zoomed in.2) The camera.  I always feel like I'm TOO zoomed in.3) Placing water was crazy ridiculous.  You need to dig into the ground then place a water pump and the water keeps filling to whatever level the pump was placed on.  It's just too complicated and to be honest, quite annoying.4) You can't build on a grid like other zoo games so your zoo ends up looking messy.5) NO BIOMES.  Nothing is organized into biomes so you have maybe 1 tree for your Savannah exhibits.  The animals like land based on ""Hardness"" which is just.. weird.6) Like I said, the menus are unorganized.  You have to hunt for the things your animals want through each menu and if you forget you have to navigate all the way back to the animal (yep, re-scroll and everything) to read their requirements again.  The animals aren't even organized.  Nothing is organized.7) No themed decorations.  You get maybe 2 flowerbeds and 2 statues.  So difficult to theme anything.8) The weather.  It might sound cool at first, having weather, but when it starts raining or snowing, suddenly EVERYONE and EVERYTHING is sad because they ""Don't like the weather"".9) Every time you want to place staff, you have to place a bulky and unattractive building.10) Buildings are nice looking, but seriously limited.  Decorations are the same way (as stated above).  For example, there are no restaurants.  Want to feed your guests?  Okay.. do they want to eat french fries and soda?  Because those are some of your main options.I want to add that Wildlife Park 3 is a much better game but I was attracted to the DLC packs for Wildlife Park 2.  I'll wait until they make DLC for Wildlife Park 3 and continue to support this developer even though I was disappointed in this game.  I love zoo builders THAT much and I think they're doing better and improving.  I will still play my zoo on Wildlife Park 2, even though the bad things I listed get seriously aggravating."

First, you have to pick the environment you want. From Costa Rica to Himilayas (heck, even a crater). Then, you have to build your whole zoo from scratch. No, not one of those crappy iphone apps where you get a colossal enclosed area and you just tapped on animals to feed them (and somehow get money from the animals), you have to actually BUILD it.This brings me to one of the bad things about the game; The prices are insanely off-bordered. A pig costs 10 dollars, while an extremely rare Napoleon Wrasse from a DLC costs 48 dollars. In real life, the Napoleon Wrasse would cost thousands.Anyway, after you start adding pens, you can put animals. They start off pretty hungry and possibly near-death, so what do you do? Either abuse the system and buy 1,000 lemon trees for cheap, or get a greenhouse for 500 dollars.Once you get an entrance, you can open up the zoo for visitors.Brings me to another bad thing; every visitor is so picky I can't even laugh about it.If you have the Crazy Zoo DLC, every single kid will not stop whining about wanting to climb something. Sometimes, I just put them in with some monkeys and tell them to climb the monkey slide. It's so annoying.You can put a wide variety of machines for visitors to use, like vendors, shops, and other stuff to take all of their money. Then, they complain to you that they ain't got no money. What do you do? Well, you have them take your money from an ATM and re-pay the same amount! YAY!Also, they want to pet the ""cute"" animals.

It's basically the same premise, after all. This game cannot be faulted for being less realistic than the ZT series, because it is, and that does add a little depth to the simulation.BUT.The interface is far, far more clunky than ZT's, and some of the design decision are questionable. For example, each zookeeper you hire requires you to build him a special Zookeeper's Hut, which is a three-story-tall eyesore. And he can only handle about two enclosures, so prepare to build a lot of them. Also, some of their claims about number of animals are specious (You can't have Rabbits AND Bunnies.), and the overall assortment of things to customize the look of your zoo is FAR smaller than ZT (No flower beds? Really? And the entire list of statues I can build is 'Bear' and 'Panda bear'.)All in all, I think ZT2 is a far better game, and kinda regret this purchase."

Animal designs are so much more realistic than in ZT2, and many are unbelievable adorable because of it (the otters!!!)2. Animal's needs and behaviors are more realistic (i.e. needing it to be hotter or colder, interacting with the natural parts of their environment for food, water, shelter, and entertainment)3. More animal and plant species to choose from (including oddities that can only be achieved through breeding and certain species that have color options when you purchase them)4. Zoo IS NOT set up on a grid system which allows more design options.5. Environmental challenges such as weather changes and temperature challenges6. You don't have to make a zoo, ZT2 made you have a zoo entrance and guests would show up and complain no matter what you did. WP2 gives you the option to make a zoo, nature preserve, farm, ranch, animal shelter, or just a natural environment for the animals to exist in.Things I like better about ZT2:1. Terraforming controls are much more user friendly in ZT, however those in WP2 are more realistic in terms of how one would actually landscape and form lakes and deep water tanks2. The sorting system, WP2 has no sorting system for anything and that can be overwhelming before you know where everything is and tedious once you do.3. Staff didn't need their own individual buildings, nor did they have a limited rangeReally in the end it all comes down to what you are looking for in a zoo game. In my case, I wanted realistic animals more than anything and a wide variety of them on top of that. However, if you want a more user friendly, child safe (I've seen multiple posts in the discussion boards from parents who aren't pleased with the realistic mating in WP2) zoo game, then perhaps ZT2 is better for you."

Be prepared to see your plants responding positively or negatively to the type of soil or temperatures you put them in.Pros+ Lots of animals, providing you get the DLCs.+Temperatures and a far more sophisticated biome system.+ Models are nice, textures are okay but could be better.+ Controls like any other builder...which is easy.Cons- Music is repetative, I recommend turning it off.- Not many buildings, decorations or enrichment items for animals...even with DLC, it feels very empty.- Some plant and animal combinations do not work when they should do (see below)Be prepared to see plants and animals, that should live in the same habitats together, suddenly flare up about ""soil being too hard"" or ""too soft"" and not liking the weather, even though you select their native land as a habitat...I am looking at you Mr.Panda and Mr.Bamboo.Why don't I recommend this game over Zoo Tycoon? Well I would do, since for a start it works on Windows 7 and up, whilst Zoo Tycoon doesn't...but the game feels incredibly empty even with all those DLCs crammed into it.If it wasn't for my computerusing WIndows 8.1 I would still be playing Zoo Tycoon, but I can't. And that would be the ONLY reason I'd recommend Wildlife Park 2; it fills a gap, though very VERY shallowly.Final verdict; Meh. 5/10."

The missions are good tutorials but they get very repetative. The interface is very clunky and the information about the animal is very vauge. This is not a zoo tycoon equivalent. The game(s) do feature different aspects that zoo tycoon didn't such as hardness level, amount of food, and weather conditions but I find those features limit the game experience instead of enhancing it. For instance I wouldn't be able to have a penguin and a dragon in the same zoo and would have to make a new save. The water placement is also an interesting mechanic but if you are going for an asthetic look is not great. The DLC only adds about 1-3 new animals which for $5 is a bit of a rip off. However compared to other zoo tycoon simulators I've tried this one holds up well.  If you are looking for something that isn't zoo tycoon and is fairly cheap then this game is okay but I reccomend looking into purchasing zoo tycoon itself (even if its expensive)."

It's more realistic than games like Zoo Empire or Zoo Tycoon, which makes it a little bit more difficult than those games. The feed you give to your animals comes from an actual building rather than the other games that I mentioned earlier. At first, I was just playing freeplay and I didn't really understand how it worked, but I played the first 6 or so missions and I got the basic stuff down from that.The one bug I found was that anytime I downsized that window(to look tutorials up on the internet, or things like that), the game crashed. This is a pain because my window menu opens up randomly and I had to restart the entire mission (which was starting to take a bit of time), so that wasn't fun. I also don't like how random animals want to swim all the time? Like, I didn't know that pandas and raccoons want to be swimming all the time, but in this game they did. Also, I was kind of hoping for there to be a cockatoo in the game but there were only macaws and not cockatoos so I was a bit disappointed in that. I also can't figure out how to open your zoo to the public in the freeplay mode, but maybe I just haven't gotten that far with the missions.What I did like in this game is how much more diverse all the animals are in this than the usual zoo simulators. I like having the option of being able to have different fish, chicken, rats, etc(Of course those are all different expansion packs but I'm grouping them all together), but /still/ kind of disappointed in the lack of a cockatoo, which is right on the loading screen art.Anyway I give it a 4 out of 5 stars. Fix the bug where it crashes each time you close  the window and then I'd make it a 5/5."

Wildlife Park 2 is a much more complex game than ZT2, however. In WP2, you must place facilities that have a monthly cost in order to produce enough food and water for your animals, your fences degrade and have to be repaired over time, animals may have to have heaters or air conditioners, plants require certain amounts of water and certain terrain types, and you need to satisfy all needs for an animal to want to breed, as opposed to ZT2 where one can satisfy the basic needs and the animal is able to breed. The non grid system is another big difference between ZT2 and WP2. In WP2, you're ble to place things basically anywhere you want since there are no defined spaces, per say. If you play freeform, you are able to even decide the placement of your own zoo entrance. The campaign games can also keep you interested if you are really wanting to do well in them. Lastly, I like the fact that there are so many expansions and DLC for this game for the player who wants to veer from the zoo and possibly have a ranch or the like.All in all, this game is a nice 'breather' from the simplistic functions of Zoo Tycoon 2. I do love both games, but I really like the realism in WP2, and that's one of the major things that keeps me so interested."

This may have been a mistake as it's possible they now hate me, this game and possibly animals in general.  In my previous review a few years ago ,which I clearly should have read before letting them play, I said that I wanted to love this game when I bought it. This time I would have settled for generally playable. It's not. In two instances animals simply refused to complete needed tasks regardless of every requirement being met meaning long challenges with limited ability to do anything else while you waited had to be restarted. The keeper staff gets hung up on gates unless their gazbo building which each of them apparently needs is placed inside the animal pens and the guests are simply terrible. There is no logic or explantion for when things go wrong and the controls are clunky and terrible. After lunch break I asked who wanted a turn with the zoo game and they both offered to let the other one play. Then they decided to color instead.I wanted to love this game. I owned it years ago and I put down any remembered flaws to hardware failures or thinking it was more difficult then it probably was. I bought the ultimate addition because I thought the marine life would be a nice addition to the game I used to play.................Two days in I have all the regrets for paying any amount of money for this. Animals are sometimes invisable. Swiss brown cow female is apparently just a shadow that moos. The animals make tons of loud rrepetitive noises constantly which is extra annoying purely because most of the missions are hurry up and wait. As the game won't run in the background I literally had to have the screen up and the game running for two hours to complete a mission after I saw to the needs of the animals.........make a better zoo while animals take the time to do their thing? can't. During missions you are locked out of most of the other features. The only reason to play the missions is because otherwise you will have no idea where or what some of the important items in the game are for sandbox mode. I still have no idea after to days how to properly build a water habitat, the controls are really seriously awful. Features seem broken. I have no idea if I am supposed to be able to change the coat color on some or all of the horses since they all look like they have that option but only two of them actually allow it. Can't make mixed animal pins easily because animals are SO picky about the surface they are on. Plants handling is a nightmare. I can't believe a game got this many expansions without them fixing some of the core world building issues.............in short I wish I had saved the money ordered a pizza and watched animal planet instead.....it would have been far less frustrating."

And there are details about it that I DO like even better than Zoo Tycoon -- such as needing to wait for animals to gestate and training the animals.But the controls are just so totally cumbersome that it's agonizing.  It's WORSE than the old controls to the original Zoo Tycoon.  There is no way to add gridlines on the terrain, so digging holes to place sea creatures in is a nightmare.  The zookeepers, trash guys, etc, all have these annoyingly small, diagonal zones -- which means you're placing workers every other exhibit.  The customers make me want to feed them all to the lions, because they're constantly demanding more plants, more food stands, more decorations, etc... even if it's only been 10 squares since the last food stand and they're three steps from a decoration.  Oh, and the decorations are (a) ugly and (b) extremely limited, so there's no satisfation in prettifying your park.Having played through almost all of the missions now, I would not recommend this game.  I wish it was better, but it's just not.  Oh, and the fact that I CAN play through almost all the missions in a couple of hours also should warn people how easy it is.

I found the missions quite tedious, sometimes going longer than an hour (cough cough the infamous Ostrich Farm mission..). I enjoyed the diverse range of animals that were only increased with the multiple DLC that became available. The game (and DLC) are affordable, and I would not have paid anything more for a game like this. It's fun, you have compelte control of how you play and run your zoo (or Wildlife Park... but really it's a zoo). I like attention to detail, the animal textures are decent and the many life styles factors that affect the wellbeing of each individual animal made the experience more real, catering to each animals individual needs as well as their herd. The mating animations were humerous and I was shocked the first time I saw a pair of Ostrichs going hard at it.. especially when I had the game in fast forward mod.. However there are a few issues with this game. You cannot access all the DLC content in the Main Game, rather playing the individual expansions separetly. I would have liked to use ALL animals and facilities in the one game to make zoos more diverse nd unique, offering more animal types and experiences for the (very ♥♥♥♥ing needy) visitors. Another issue that has put me off the game is the fact about a third if not a half of the animals textures no longer work and instead you have an awkward giant ♥♥♥♥ign square.

Not that it's a big deal...>The Weather sounds like a good touch, but all it seems to do is give everyone a negative mood.The Bad>Dear GOD the music, I am so sick of hearing the same song OVER and OVER to the point where I finally turned it off.>For a large duration of the game, everything is silent, except for the sound of water pumps, and the occassionaly cry from an animal. There is no AMBIENCE. Music does not play until you zoom out. If you're zoomed in to look at the animals closer, the music stops, and all you can hear are those annoying as all hell water pumps.>The UI and it's organization is AWFUL.>Couldn't they include a grid system? Placing things feels so janky and wrong compared to games like the 'Zoo Tycoon' series.>The VERY LITTLE variety in terms of buildings, gates, walls, fences, etc. that this game offers.>What is up with water placement? I absolutely hate the pump system this game has.>Having to place these giant, space taking buildings for each individual staff member is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.>The AI for the animals, people, and staff are stupid. The animal AI just wanders wherever it pleases, and have had doctors literally walk past injured bodies in their job's sphere of influence, and do nothing. Nevermind the AWFUL AI pathing for everything.>The fences, gates, and walls ARE WORTHLESS. I've had a giant Crocodile devour a tourist behind an ELECTRIC FENCE. How the hell does that even happen?>The amount of DLC for this game is incredible. There are a few which do add some nice new animals and buildings, etc. But some are either pointless, or should already be in another DLC/Base game.>Instead of just having a ""Hunger"" bar, animals sometimes have several bars which they need to have filled. Does it make sense for a Crocodile to want to eat meat after eating a pile of fish? Why does it care so much to eat meat when it just had a pile of fish?The Ugly>I don't know if it affects me, but apparently people are missing certain animals from the games files. This is has something to do with the fact that each expansion doesn't act like a DLC, but instead as a seperate game. So some animals, maps, and missions don't appear at all unless you run a specific expansion.ConclusionIf you are looking for a Zoo simulation game, this is not what you want. Go order Zoo tycoon 2 on Amazon if you really want to play a good Zoo simulation. If you REALLY are desperate enough to want to get a Zoo game, get this and it's expansions on a sale."

Shaping the ground is something that I find difficult in this game. (There isn't really an option to make the ground the same level, filling a space up with water can be hard) I haven't found a way to top view the park either (yet) which makes shaping also a lil difficult. The music is SUPER repetitive. The animal sounds are even worse.All in all.. I wouldn't recommend it but it might just still be fun to play.. casually...I'm not so sure , I really hoped for more content I guess.(My opinion can still change though xD)"

Wonderful for kids, not so cerebral for adults so for me it's a good zen/casual game.If you're looking for challenging scenarios and a financial manager, I'd look elsewhere.Zoo Tycoon is more challenging in terms of scenarios and managing finances all the while balancing animal happiness. You learn tips, tricks, and shortcuts for success while WP is pretty straight forward. WP2 does have some better defined realism, such as actual gestation time for animal pregnancies, but it's just plain easy to 'win' and turn constant profit.Both games (Zoo Tycoon and Wildlife Park 2) are good, but not equivalent/don't have the same focus.ZT had better customization with its modding community and a better selection of items/objects/fences to place to match your aesthetic while Wild Park 2 has some aggravating graphical shortcomings (i.e. your animal keeper gate is always made of wood, even if the fence is made of concrete).By and large, I like Zoo Tycoon better, but I don't regret purchasing or playing Wildlife Park 2."

So I came across this while looking for a replacement.There's a couple things that make this better than Zoo Tycoon -- the mechanics of the environment such as temperature, and water turning regular dirt to mud, are far more detailed -- and a couple things that make it worse -- for one, building a large enclosure that is realistically suitable for animals such as elephants or dolphins is penalized because if an individual gets too far away from its group it feels lonely. Smaller enclosures are almost required to keep the animals together -- but overall I think they're comparable and I'm happy I got this game.The ability for random genetic mutations of albinism and melanism to occur is also SUPER cool.

,Recommended,304350,35223690,Posted: 26 September,all,waddigator,"Can be likened to Zoo Tycoon 2, albeit more realistic. WLP2 is more 'mature' due to its inclusion of mating animations for almost every animal in the game. It also is possible for animals and park guests to be injured and die, having animation for death and for floating in water after death. This led to some rather sadistic experiments on my part.Animals are very good at sustaining themselves. Herbivores can feed from plants depending on the type of food they store, and carnivores will seek out corpses or attack a live animal.WLP2 is moddable to an extent; users can add new creatures based on existing ones or modify behaviors. Overall was very enjoyable. Expansions are worth purchasing.The campaign levels were entertaining, and despite reports of bugs in the discussions, I had no problems.Biggest issue is that map selection will be limited depending on which exe is launched. Each expansion is treated like a different game."
