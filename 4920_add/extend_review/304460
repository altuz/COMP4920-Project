But there really isn't any. The art is pretty, the music is nice, and the story's okay if you enjoy purposefully cryptic storytelling. But honestly, this whole thing could have, and probably should have, been an animation instead of a game.Looking at the description, I notice that it was made by a filmmaker. And honestly, it feels like a film, except that it's one where I constantly have to hold down the right arrow key and occasionally press the spacebar to activate my cutscene vision. It's sad too, because if it were a film, it could have probably been a pretty decent one, but as a game... no."

Not to mention the painful pacing at times (repeatedly jumping across 3 screens? Who thought that would make for interesting gameplay?).If you're going to make a serious, atmospheric game that draws people in, then cut the humour down as you go along. If you want to make a game that throws jokes around with every NPC you speak to, then at least have some sort of goal or satirical message to make the experience worthwhile. I came out of this game feeling robbed of the few hours I wasted on it, and with the worst case of gaming blue balls I've had in a while."

I enjoyed Journey and I enjoyed this game as well. This game is an indie 2d game that people will just love to hate and pick apart just because. I bought this on a whim because of the original artstyle. It has the music and graphics to support a simple short story. When you finally complete it, you realize there was some love that went into this game. There are the indie games that are trying to make a buck and there are others that just want to give you a completely new idea of gaming. This one doesn't and plays it safe, but the artwork, attention to detail, and music are just there. I assume this will go on sale for Halloween or Christmas for 5 bucks. Pick it up. Haters gun hate. I had fun. The struggle is real."

Being a story telling game, it doesn't have much in the way of controls, but it is intuitive enough to pick up on what to do, or how to go about it. Despite the graphics, I was immersed into the world of the game, and can imagine how crazy-awesome the lands are that you venture through.Definitely worth investing in, if you can afford it."

The gameplay is a little uninvolving but i suppose thats the point.BUT if you will cast your mind back to a few sentences ago you will notice that it was a 2 hour experience.

It makes no sense.Anyways, now that we got that out of the way...The game can become a bit tedious at points as your character isn't exactly a fast guy.Some scenes can take a bit longer than you may wish, but all-in-all this game keeps you interested.The game is quite short, I completed it in 3 hours, and I play games to explore as much as possible, a term often used iscompletionist.Dialogue and story.The dialogue between other characters and the story in general is quite witty, amusing.The game contains a few references to a couple things and makes you say""Hey, yea I know that!"".Keeps the game fresh and causes a sense of relation.The world, art, soundtrack and general atmosphere of the game.This game is beautiful. It is calming, it is funny and intriguing. The music is lovely and serene.The atmosphere, the general tone and emotions I got while playing was a mix of relaxation and serenity, curiosity and amusement.Conclusion.This game will by most people be looked at as not really a game but an experience, a story of sorts, and I tend to agree.I can view this game as an artistic story filled adventure.But I can't bring myself to not recommend this because of how it rejuvenated my thoughts on platformer games.And I was entertained throughout the entire game and looked forward to the next bit of story, the next bit of dialogue and the next witty or charming thing.All-in-all, this game is good for what it is and it's damn good for being the first game these developers have made.I recommend you purchase this game if you're into this kind of stuff and I recommend you play it in one sitting."

The writing is gentle, whimsical and poignant. If this were an indepedent, fantasy movie, I'd watch it. That said, to echo other commenters, it's so barely interactive that it really didn't feel like a game. I had to stop as I just didn't feel like I had any agency. I also got the strongest impression that what mechanics exist (i.e. machete a few bits of brush / rock out of the way) were there to deliberatly slow play down and force the player to drink in each scene. Though I understand the appeal of really slowing down and acting mindfully when presented with this kind of experience, the pacing felt labored in the extreme. I guess I just don't want to stroll slowly through an oil painting, no matter how beautiful (and Qora is deeply beautiful on multiple levels)."

The world reveals itself slowly but gracefully and I found myself wanting to continue until I reached the end.The story is pretty fresh, quite irreverent and I chuckled a few times at the silliness.  It does a good job of balancing the humor, weirdness and the ghostly references of past adventurers' deeds.  You can tell the writers play a lot of games like this and wanted to bring something new to the table.It's an easy, relaxing experience and rewards your collection-hunting with massive story-elements rewards in the end.  I was quite charmed by the ancient beasts, guides and spirit-visions.  Some players may understandly want to speed up the certain clunkier moments or want more gameplay in general, but it's a more passive experience by nature so my advice is to just enjoy the ride.(All this said, I'm very glad I only got it for $1 and I doubt I would be as pleased if I paid $10. I do clearly think it is currently underrated regardless IMHO)"

The game tells a story while you travel through its well made landscapes and ambients. The soundtrack fits the atmosphere and makes the experience even better. There is little to no gameplay, which doesnt matter since the game is ment to be an storytelling and atmospheric game. I recommend to watch some gameplay before buying, to see if the game fits your expectations. Try to dive in the game and its world and you wont be dissapointed."
,Not Recommended,304460,12436081,"Posted: 10 October, 2014",all,lowtierhero,"Underwhelming. Qora is an exploration focused game in the vein of Knytt or Proteus, but fails to engage like the aforementioned. A crippling lack of interaction causes this game to rely on it's (admittedly very pretty) visuals and sound. However, silly ""random"" humor and recycled jokes kill the atmosphere at every turn. The aforementioned lack of interaction makes this game struggle to define itself as a game as opposed to a movie, with most input from the player boiling down to walking in the appropriate direction and pressing Space to activate cutscenes. If you're a fan of exploration oriented games, it may tickle your fancy, but at a $10 asking point, it feels difficult to justify."

I like the art but think it could be better.  The environments are varied and fascinating and beautiful, but again, I think their portrayal could be better.The pacing is slow; within my tolerance, but too slow for most players.  There are neither puzzles nor platforming sequences nor even the most rudimentary combat; the ""interactivity"" is almost exclusively limited to pressing a single button and moving forward.What really kills the game for me, though, is the nigh-schizophrenic weirdness of the story elements.  The strongest narrative thread runs through the whole game, but we never see its resolution.  Mixed with this are ghosts of past civilizations and events (which add to the experience) and... alien abductions, string quartets, and bashful invisible creatures (which really strained my suspension of disbelief).  The whole thing ends with what would feel like a deus ex machina if it actually resolved any of the confusion preceding it, but instead just feels like getting hit in the face with a hallucinogenic frying pan.I came into this game with high hopes, expecting it to live up to the standard set by Sword & Sworcery.  It did not, and instead damaged my fondness for pixel art.  Thumbs down."

This game looked neat, and different than anything I had ever seen before, and it was. The first thing I hear upon opening the game is the beautiful title music. I start to play enjoying the simplicity of the game. Throughout the game only five buttons are actually used, and despite the absence of any dynamic player controls I found this game entertaining.  It only took a couple hours (about 3) but I strongly advise everyone to take their time. Whether it is worth the $10 is completely up to you. (completely worth it if it goes on sale).Most of the game (exept for parts in the begining where you go left) involves constantly holding D (right arrow default) to walk endlessly to the right (perhaps a little slowly for my taste but this can be overlooked). All actions in the game including the few player interaction moves (jumping, climbing, etc.) are all executed using the spacebar (default) and can only be used when prompted by the game.There is no doubt that if you get this game it will not be for the direct gameplay which is virtually nonexistant. It will be for:1. the soundtrack, which is quite good especially that opening theme and comparable to the FEZ soundtrack2. the scenery, in which some cases you may sit on onescreen for a few minutes just looking at it3. the plot, the feeling this game causes is impossible to accurately explainThe Plot - (NO spoilers here keep reading)The plot over all was great. The journey that your charcter embarks on will fill you a sence of awe. It goes at a relatively slow pace but that is how this game is. It keeps you wondering building up with more mystery untill the end, and it turns out it is the single worst ending I have ever seen in a game with such a great ... well everything else. The ending had a ruinous effect on the feeling the rest of the game created. You play through such a mysterious, deep, moving plot and then it is ruined by a very trivial ending in which a very serious game is turned into a big joke.So here is what I recomend. I would encourage you to get the game as it is truely a great game, but i would actually advise you not to view the ending thereby maintaining that sense of wonder this game will surely cause you to feel."

There isn't much in terms of 'gameplay' - mostly walking around with occasional dialogue and simple environmental interactions. What made this game appeal so much to me was the imaginative setting, great visuals and atmosphere. For such a simple game the sound design is also remarkably good and really immersive. There is a definite narrative, but many of the details are left to the imagination of the player.Your character moves at quite a slow pace, but the attention to detail in the art of each level was enough to keep me interested while playing. Some people are calling this game a platformer, which isn't very accurate as the only kind of movement available aside from walking and climbing is done with contextual actions.Throughout the game you move across all kinds of different environments and getting to the end feels like a satisfying conclusion to a great adventure. A regular playthrough takes about two hours - If Qora sounds like the kind of game that would appeal to you I would recommend buying it at a discount."

Mostly the games is just you holding the right arrow and hitting space as you read dialogue, but with a game like this it honestly isn't about the gameplay but more the story, which is why I say get it on sale. Does it hold replay value no but as mentioned above the first playthrough is great if you have the paitence for this kind of game. If you can pick it up on sale it's a great purchase to consider getting otherwise go ahead and save your money.

So I would, in theory, enjoy a slow paced visually arsty exploration game with minimal player involvement for the experience of it all. However, Qora was a real disappointment for me.First on the visual elements—I found the art style underwhelming. There are some gorgeous 8-bit style games out there. This, in my opinion, wasn’t one of them. I don’t know, the advertised screenshots were pretty, but I quickly found the visuals monotonous. Same with the music, there were some pretty themes, but the repetition quickly irritated me. One random positive note for me though was that I found the jumping, stair climbing, and pickaxe swinging animations strangely satisfying. Maybe because it was something new to look at.The story—Oh god the writing in this. I think its trying really hard to be edgy and funny, but it just fails so badly that I felt like I was cringing every time I had to read dialogue, and you have to read a fair bit (you have to talk to basically everyone in town in order to get the items you need to continue). Jokes about decapitation, suicide, bestiality, and homophobia were casually tossed about, and I wasn’t bothered so much as confused—I thought this was more a meditation on the meaning of life, not South Park, and they weren’t even remotely funny, just stupid, which would have been their own redeeming value.Also, the plotting was weird in my mind, I felt shoehorned into a story I didn’t particularly care about, with a (mostly) silent protagonist (who won’t comment on things like the gods talking to him or boulders crashing down and nearly killing him but will note that its kinda odd that there’s a ghost) and a mystery that not even the other characters in the game seem to care that much about. There seems to be no investment in trying to get the player to care about what’s happening and why, just assuming that if we continue playing we obviously care about what’s going to happen next.Mechanics—and this is where I basically found my feeling for this game going from frustration to rage. After twenty minutes of playtime, I decided to save and quit and maybe see if I wanted to try it again some other time. Or at least I tried to; the game helpfully informed me that if I left now all my progress on level would be lost. I resigned myself to playing some more, sure that eventually I’d get to the end of the level and be able to save. Nope. I played over an hour, with every time I tried to quit getting the same message, and no indications of whether or not I had gotten to a new level or if the game had saved. I eventually just gave up and left.Maybe someday I’ll try again and find out if the game actually saved anywhere or if I’ll have to start over again from the beginning. Maybe. Probably not."

It's strictly linear, the interaction feels unnecessary and the ""multiple ending"" part is more of a self-indulgent joke if you ask me. Don't get me started with writing and the story, the game works a lot better if you just ignore it. Oh and there's speciesism everywhere despite the whole ""harmony with nature"" theme it develops later on.What's really nice though, is the vast set of pixel art landscapes it brings you. If you're a sucker for well-done pixel art like me, it's must - imagine Shadow of Colossus style grandness with the visual simplicity of something like Knytt. I would've appreciated better character animation and less repetitive music, though. It just feels like a huge wast to see those awesome background images beeing covered in what feels lackluster.That said... I'm kinda torn on this one. I can't recommend it to anyone who doesn't love pixel art and spatial greatness. Personally, I did not regret the 2€ buy during summer sale, but I never would've bought it for the normal price of 10€. If you have both money to spare and strongly appreciate it's strong points, you should give it a try. But I can't recommend it under different circumstance."

There isn't much of what you would call game play, it is mostly just 2D side scrolling walking and slight interactions with the characters in the game.  There are no creatures that need killing, and no plumetting to your death.  It's just a quiet, relaxing experience.The time to completion will run roughly three hours, but I thoroughly got my money's worth out of it.  If you're looking for something different and something a little more laid back, you can't really go wrong with this one."

The interactivity is limited to pushing the space bar to talk to someone or cut down some grass that's in your way.To be sure, it's a beautiful corridor, with lovely music and art. But this is not an ""adventure"" in any sense. When you sit in an armchair and watch The Hobbit, Bilbo's having an adventure... you're not. Same thing here. There's no ""player"" in this game, and no ""exploring."" You will get 100% of the experience by watching a YouTube playthrough, and you won't have to hold down the right arrow key the whole time.For an example of this genre done right, check out Seiklus - an old freeware game by Autofish."

The story is interesting, the music is lovely, and the graphics are incredible. At least, I think they're stunning. This is one that's worth adding to your library - perhaps when it's on sale ($10 is a bit high, and it doesn't even include the soundtrack which is totally worth owning).I gladly sunk hours into this one. I'd probably do it again. And that's all I have to say about it. 10/10, would play again."

I like this game, its not overly exciting, nor does it have interesting characters or a massive in-depth story. Additionally, this is an extremely casual game, similar Flower, or Journey in feel. What it lacks in interesting gameplay it makes up for with beautiful, relaxing music and magnificent scenery. I admit, however that the music does tend to drone on a bit, even still I found it pleasent to listen to. The whole beautiful pixel art scenic background thing thats popular among many indie developers may seem overdone to some, but i find to be a creative way to immerse the player in the world. all in all I'd give this game an 8/10."

The gift-giving sequence near the end felt a little out of place (you'll know what I mean when you play it), but the comedy overall was nearly as potent as the mystic splendor. The Traveler, the Empress, the Villagers, the Deities, and more. All the characters so richly portrayed themselves in so few lines and cut scenes that I'm labeling the devs 'masters of dialogue' as well as visual composition. I loved this game. 10/10"
,Recommended,304460,20157025,"Posted: 31 December, 2015",all,Frogge,"Qora is a game I think everyone likes exploration games should own. It's linear, it's relaxing, and it has an awesome soundtrack.So, I don't exactly know how to compress my feelings about qora at all. I guess I'll start by the graphics. The graphics design was extremely beautiful. Same goes for the designs, the areas are all extremely well made. Most of them are surreal and unique, and even the plain ones still feel really good. It had a good storyline, I was not expecting the ending at all.Seeing that the ghost was the empress and the empress was qora were both suprising. The soundtrack was pretty good. The music really went well with each location. When it was a dark situation, there was silent eerie soundtrack. When you were in a beautiful area, there was calm or upbeat music. I think you get what I mean.It has a good athmosphere, there are some very creepy scenes, especially the scene with the hidden bunker. It also has two endings, and multiple ends are always nice! It does leave some questions in your head though. What are the white masked guys? Aliens? Did the deities give anyone else gifts when they moved in, and did they have to go through all that too?Now, I don't recommend it for everyone. There isn't really much to do in it. There is a lot of exploration, but no puzzles, action sequences or deaths in this case. It's linear, and most of the time you are just heading right. There are some scenes where you have to wake up beasts, break rocks or do a little platforming, but most of the time it's just a game about exploring scenery. If you don't like games like that, then you should probably not buy this. Other than that, it's a pretty great game.Also, love the credits theme. The quotes people wrote are pretty silly, you guys all make me laugh :3Sorry for the short review, but like I said, there isn't much to say about qora other than the things I have mentioned.Here's my playlist!https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbBjoGTz_G4qjS6Ak3MpjHUBucF62J7mI"
