,Not Recommended,304580,19445795,"Posted: 2 December, 2015",all,Gibson,"5 hours in.I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone at this time in it's current state.1. The steering is terrible. (Sensitivity is very high without an adjustment in the options).2. Controller support is there, but not ALL there. (50% of the keybindings for the controller you are not even able to bind to the controller) So you can only do a few things and the rest must be done via keyboard.3. The way the garbage is done is just terrible and very slow. (There is no AI help when doing garbage) You drive the truck get out, then you have to push a button to ready the truck to accept the bin, then you have to go get the bin, slowly walk it back to the truck (some of the bins are the double bins that a person could NOT push IRL) hook it to the back of the truck, push the button again to lift the trash into the truck then watch a cut scene then you have to take the bin off, again slowly walk it back to where you got it from (usually 50 ft from the road) then go back to the truck and hit the button again to close the forks and then get in the truck.(So many things done wrong here.) Cut scenes WHY? Just let it do the animation.4. The trucks make this annoying shifting sound every few seconds. I mean WHY! There isn't even a in cab view so why even add the shifting sound. I mean ya, you can have a shifting sound, but holy hell it's so loud and annoying.5. The AI workers you can send out don't actually go out and do the jobs given to them. Your trucks just sit at your parking lot and say ""this truck is being used by a worker"". Very lame. It's 2015 and these people can't even make proper features in a game.6. The AI cars are just plain dumb. They ram you, cut you off, run stop signs and you get the ticket for hitting them.7. You get tickets for hitting cars and pedestrians, but not for running red lights.8. I have done all of the jobs except the gardening. The jobs themselves are very simplistic almost to the point where the game looks like it is targeting an audience of 6 yr olds.9. The economic gameplay is a joke. You can hire workers and fast forward time and just get millions in about 5 minutes.10. The models of the trucks are 7/10 - the world is 4/10 (looks like it's from 2005) - sounds are 3/10 - overall gameplay 4/10If you want to try it go for it. imo it's worth about $7Final Verdict - Don't buy until 50%+ sale."
76561198053350603,Not Recommended,304580,19557622,"Posted: 7 December, 2015",all,WendellThrewUp,"OK, here are my thoughts at this point:Let's get the ""stupid review memes"" out of the way:-	11/10 - would push dumpsters again!-	Alternate Title: Cut Scene Watching Simulator 2016!Other reviewers have already pointed out a few of the shortcomings of this game: It seems pretty un-optimized, Bins spawn in unreachable places, the steering radii of the vehicles makes them annoyingly unmaneuverable, the truck sounds are garbage (pun intended), the AI vehicles are unerringly stupid, and Why oh Why does it seem to be raining every 5 minutes?!?! But all of these are fixable in future patches. The developer has already released a major patch within a day or two of release, and seems committed to further updates to please the users. Great news, right!Wrong. I'm afraid no level of updating is ever going to make this the great game you were hoping for. The freedom in this games' design is just too limiting within the confines of its skill tree and XP, and aside from unlocking the ability to move a different type of vehicle, over a different sewer, pothole, bin, car, hedge, or stain in a different part of the generic looking map to earn more XP leaves too little for the imagination beyond a few hours of grinding. Grinding can be fun but the mechanics and limitations in each skill tree are too similar. One issue I had was I was earning 3K and 250 XP per job for ""towing"" a car, then 6:00 AM the next morning it was 2K and 200 XP per job. Just when I thought I had found a way to earn quick cash for that next vehicle the rug was pulled under my feet! Also, hiring workers to do anything for you is useless when they earn 40% of what you would earn and take 4000% longer burning all of your fuel in the process.The tools we are given look promising and realistic, but the handling is wonky and their uses are very much ""on rails"". I have a lifter on the front of my Paper Recycling truck, so that should give me the ability to drive up and lift the bins without doing the ""dumpster drag"" right? Wrong, buddy you are dragging dumpsters again. And why is there a small version of anything? I have to buy it and unlock a bigger version with a bigger tank of whatever to do 20 missions to get a bigger one so I can do it over again? I will say that I enjoyed the mowing and hedge trimming skill tree the most of all, as I felt it provided the best mix of challenge and reward.And last and least, the setting. I'll give the developers an ""E"" for effort, as I can see touches in the map and city design that give it a little bit of flair. But on the whole the city you are doing these tasks in is just too bland and uninspiring to draw you back into doing any more grinding. In other games you can take a look out the window while you are doing whatever and just enjoy the setting in a relaxing way. Here there is just too little for the imagination to work with.While this had the look of something great in this genre ""on the tin"", I'm afraid there is too little on the inside at this point to recommend it. On the positive, I’m totally ready for the “Dumpster Pushing Nationals” next year!"

The Dev team seems to be taking care of nagging issues and adding things to the game as they go along.The game itself. Picture the following. Any Garbage Truck simulator (That are terrible and slow) Tow Truck simulator (That is just.. god awful) Street Sweeper simulator (Slow, never worked for me) take all the problems out of them, you got a nice little buisness sim game, The controls are nice and do support controllers and wheels (Added support) No Interior views but the models themselves are greatly put together. There are a few problems to be ironed out (Aggressive AI traffic , A front loaded Recycling truck that needs to be manually loaded by hand instead of inside the cab, Some locations that have traffic just stop dead in the middle of the road and kill framerate. )Mutiplayer is OK in it's current state but needs much improvement when using some trucks.So is it worth the buy? Possibley, maybe when the price just drops a bit."

This game for me gets a little borring. you clean up your cityies streats and you do jobs. However while you take a trash can to dump it into your truck you have to wait about 15 seconds to continue this is on almost every jod so find out if you want this game or not.

For anyone who is having issues getting this to run, the tips I got from mayamak and others were fantastic!mayamak 4 Dec @ 11:51amwhat is your system settings?* If you are useing laptop try to force Nvidia Card to run a game. Here is a description how to do it >http://steamcommunity.com/app/304580/discussions/0/485624149150490370/*update your Graphic Card drivers* Options menu setup on low system configuration:- go to Video tab change Antialiasing and max. Anisotropy parameters to lower values.- you can also chenge resolution form Default to some any other that will increase your performance.- go to Performance tab nad set LOW presets and turn OFF all parameters.My laptop has a Radeon 5000 card in it so I downloaded and installed the AMD Catalyst Control Centre; and it worked!!!!!!PROSUnique idea: Not many have thought of the notion of a 'Utility Simulator' although I believe that there was one of these released before, but it was ham strung by limited missions!A good open world: Rather than being confined to a small area with little else to do after you have completed all tasks, the fact that this game has a huge map should help with playability!Good selection of vehicles: The vehicle selection in this is great with a good eye for detail!CONSThe game still tends to run slow at times; hopefully the devs will work on thisAI traffic is a nightmare, as another player pointed out; they crash into you and then you get fined, again the devs should look at this!!Most of the sounds are fine, however the sound of the drain cleaners should be changed, as it sounds nothing like a drain cleaner!!Overall though a decent shot at a game, there are a few things that would be grat to see in it, first of all the interaction between the player character and the vehicles should change, the only vehicles to have any interaction with them are the garbage trucks. The street repair with the tar lorry or 'hotbox' as it is really known could probably do with the player having to remove the old surface with a pneumatic hammer and then use the hotbox to fix the surface. It would be great if there was a weather change, were it snowed and gritting lorries with snow plows could be used. A wider range of waste products such as construction waste, industrial waste, hazardous waste and on street domestic refuse would beef up the realism of the game; with these different categories, different vehicles could also be used such as skip lorries and big hook lift lorries with big skips for construction waste and closed boxes for hazardous waste, but then again that is just me and my imagination ;) So my new review would be 7/10, well done devs!!!First ReviewIt would be nice if the devs could turn the system requirements down so as more could play this game, I got the game as I figured that my gaming laptop could handle it, it wouldn't even launch as apparently my GPU does not meet the minimum requirements!!!! :( I have other games here which are just as graphically demanding, but run fine such as Farming Simulator 2015, which I consider to be one of the most polished and well presented games on Steam!! Dig It - A digger simulator, again when I got this I was suspicious that it might not even run, I was surprised when it did without lag or drag. I do have others as well which have fantastic graphics and don't cause problems! So until the devs come up with a solution to this problem it is a 0/10 from me, as it really is a gamble as to whether or not this will run on your machine!!! :( :( :("

Mostly in this game, you drive waste trucks around, collecting the towns rubbish. Unfortunately, for all of the vehicles in this game, there is no in-cab or cockpit view of inside the cabin. That is a huge let-down for me. If it had an in-cab view, I would recommend this game, but sadly because of that, I recommend the game as 'No'. Improvements must be made, CityConomy.2.5 - 5 stars from me."

I am pretty pleased with it and do think there is quite a nice variety of city services on offer. So far I have only tried Garbage man and Tow truck specializations and am enjoying it so far. A few points I'm dissapointed about it the lack of a interior view and a ridiculously slow walking speed when moving bins.UPDATE #1: Nano games have released a patch introducing Turn signals, faster movement of bins and more.

All the garbage/recycling trucks work the same.. Even the one that has the overhead arms and dumps in the top..2. The AI get so close to your truck constantly you either have to keep moving up and hope they give you enough room to fit the dumpster in or drive/park on the sidewalk3. it seems like every 5 minutes it is raiining yet again, and again, and again.4. no variations for garbage truck, yet you have 3 different trucks for recycling stuff.5. Driving physics are poor. Can't drive somewhat decent and AI cars drive like they are driving a nascar race.6. AI hit you even when stopped and brake on and you get fined"
