I wasn't expecting this much fun from a game that costs $2.99 (not including the discount!) It's scaled very well, and despite being a multiplatform release, looks pretty good on pc and does give you the choice of using a keyboard, a mouse, or a combination of the two. The enemies aren't stupid and winning on normal can often be a challenge depending on what faction you are versing, and hard is actually pretty challenging. Also, the research and upgrading tab means you can actually use different strategies and it isn't just the same game over and over. And finally, the idea for a ""Scrambled"" faction is brilliant!If you are looking for a short video to show you what the game is, here's a link to a 2 minute one:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jUFD9CUA_QAnd if you're looking for a more indepth look at the game, here's a link to an approximately 20 minute video that looks at multiple modes:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ83YypDxdM&feature=youtu.be"

It is very similiar to tower defence + MOBA games. Actually it is the wonderful indie child of Starcraft and Dota.Pluses+ Beautiful graphic(it's simple but still has deep atmosphere of it)+ Nice music and sounds(it is not anoying like it happens in some casual games)+ Great system of developing+ Nice campaining and plot(it's kinda usual but still keeps the smell of casual space strategy, could I ask for more?)+ Multyplayer(play this game with your friend is a good chance to solve some argues. Jokes aside!)+ Additional plus... I don't know why. I just love it. :)___Would love to see in the game...Actually not minuses at all, just my wishes.- No modes(there is the only map. And I'd like to see much more ways to fight with an enemy)- No characters(yes, the game is beautiful designed, but I would love to see some characters, like commanders or alians in there)- No quests(why not? There is a huge area to make some plot twiestes)Thank you, delepores, for this great game. I will spend a lot of my free time in there. Quite so!"

So I went into it not much expecting, but I am getting some pleasant surprises. Don't expect anything fancy from graphics or sound - they do the job, but that's it. As for so many Indie games, this one is all about the gameplay.Basically, this is a tower defense game: you have to gather resources (happens automatically), build ever more powerful units, and research upgrades for them. With these spaceships, the goal is to reach the mothership of your opponent, at the other side of the playfield, while at the same time defending your own mothership against incoming attacks.Since there is only one path between the two bases, most of the time the two opposing fleets meet somewhere in between, slowly (or faster if you're good) progressing towards the enemy's side. There is not much more to it: the core gameplay is dead simple, but it has something about it that keeps the attention going. One does have to make important and micro-strategic decisions: does one invest the resources gathered into new ships, or rather into upgrades? And there is a neat supra research-tree, which allows you to spend resource points that affects all or any of the three factions in the game.Part of the attraction of the game surely lies in the excellent way it is embedded in the Steam cloud, with achievements, trading cards, multiplayer options, rankings, etc. Name it, and this game has it. So for the moment I want to try going up on the ladder, or win my first multiplayer. It's a simple game, but it does what it wants to do pretty good.Gameplay: 21/30Graphics: 10/20Sound: 5/10Longelivety: 14/20 (MP looks promising)Technical: 6/10 (I had one very bad crash after exiting)Personal rating: 6/10Overall socre: 62/10060-70/100: a good game, worth purchasing if in discount or if you like the genre"

There is not much to the mechanics,and most of the strategy is purely brute forcing your rival's base. The game features local multiplayer and matchmaking, but these are dead as hell on the PC version, so dont count them towards your judgement.Not a bad game per se, but once you beat the main campaing, there is absolutely nothing else to it besides the absurd and fruitless grind that requires getting a 100%. get it for less than o.70 on a sale only if only you really donty have anything else to spend your money."
,Recommended,304670,18837366,"Posted: 2 November, 2015",all,Detail.movie💕,"Aeon Command is a deceivingly challenging tug-of-war game with strategy elements that almost reminds me of an RTS. You don't have to command units, they automatically attack the enemy. The only thing the player does is manage resources, applies powerups (buffs, debuffs), deploys weapons (nukes, emps), and purchases upgrades for units. The more obvious thing players must do is build units. I found it relaxing, rewarding, and late games were challenging and exhilarating.There's 3 factions to choose from and they all have their own unique appearance and they all have their own weapons. However, they have similar basic unit types which keeps it fairly well balanced. I say fairly because there are some different support units for each faction. The similarities will be noticeable in attack units. I had little trouble identifying an enemy ship and launching the appropriate counter. Watching the space battles unfold is quite interesting, it reminded me of Battlestar Galactica for some reason. A word of warning, this game starts off unforgivingly and you may lose many of your first matches. Does it get better? Yes it does, because of two types of upgrades. There are game-wide upgrades that you can upgrade from the main menu and these are purchased using ""gear parts"" you acquire from destroyed enemies. These upgrades are applied to every game thereafter. The second type of upgrade is the in-game upgrades which must be purchased with scrap and these only apply for the duration of that match. Generally, upgrades modify weapons and armour but there are also resource collection upgrades which I researched first because the best economy almost always wins.The campaigns are short and aren't full of narrative. If you want a deep story, you won't find it in this game. HOWEVER, I recommend this game because of high replay value and the gameplay is well polished.The soundtrack is more like ambience and I found it added to the atmosphere. Sound effects from weapons to explosions are also well done. The only sound effect that drove me nuts was the spacial anomaly sound effect which you'll only hear in 1 or 2 campaign missions anyway.Pros:RTS elements that still keeps you involved in the battle.Well balanced units that still stand apart and look interesting.Nice sound effects and music.UPGRADES HERE, UPGRADES THERE, UPGRADES EVERYWHERE! \o/Straight forward tutorial.Unit and upgrade prices are reasonable.Cons:Short campaigns with little narrative.No unit descriptions except one-time descriptions in the campaign.The enemy will sometimes spam tugs which will tow your entire fleet to their dooms.Neutral:Unforgiving for new players.I had a lot of fun with this game and I am absolutely astonished that (as of purchasing this game) no one in my friends list has this on their wishlist or owns it. So if you're reading this, I highly recommend it for it's replay value and the great gameplay. 8/10"

I enjoyed my time playing it, but after beating the main campaign and playing a few skirmishes, it leaves me with a thought in my mind that says, now what?Obviously, multiplayer would be a grand option...but no one is active in the multiplayer, so unless you have friends who play this, it is unlikely you will ever find a real human to play against.Replaying the campaign doesn't change anything either besides getting a better high score. Sigh...So after 3.5 hours, it appears I have maxed out my time with Aeon Command. A game I thoroughly enjoyed playing but ended up short with little replayability.Even after all that, the game is priced fairly and is something I can see improving if the Dev ever decides to revisit this game. I did enjoy my time with this game. I did like this game. But, there isn't much to do after beating the 2 hour long campaign. This game is for those who want to play a game for a few hours and then ultimately move on to other games in their inventory. A good distraction."
,Recommended,304670,12694774,"Posted: 30 October, 2014",all,SinHunt3r,Aeon Command is a streamlined space RTS.  You start with a mothership and are tasked with collecting resources to build space craft to take on the opposing mothership.  You really just have one collectable resource which is metal.  You also have eneregy to use abilities but that is automatically generated over time or collected as power-ups from the wreckage of defeated enemy ships.  Once you get some resources flowing you can start to build ships to assail your enemy.  Once built your ships will automatically seek out and attack the enemy.  You can't directly control combat but you can influence the battles using special abilities to buff your troops or debuff and even damage the enemy fleet.  The trick comes down to what ships to produce when and what improvements to research.  You can research better ships and improve your ships armor and weapons during play.  You can also permanently augment the ships and abilities of the three different playable factions by spending upgrades collected in the campaign and skirmishes.Aeon Command contains a single player camaign and a skirmish mode.  The campaign is a tutorial and campaign in one.  The campaign is pretty easy with a difficulty spike at the end.  Once you start to really understand resource management and research you'll dominate the campaign in no time.  I have not tried the multiplayer but I imagine it would be pretty fun to battle it out with a friend.Overall a fun game.  It probably won't occupy you for too long (the campaign can be beaten in a couple hours) but for a few bucks it's a pretty fun space game.

76561197976312757,Not Recommended,304670,15838893,"Posted: 15 May, 2015",all,Destyre,"This is a game modeled after the mods for the RTS sub genre typically found for mods of Blizzard games called ""Tug of war"".I wanted a game like this that I didn't need to run Starcraft 2 or Warcraft 3 in order to play, but I have to say that I'm quite disappointed. If you don't know what a tug of war game is, let me explain: A tug a war game is where you typically have 2 teams. Both teams have to build a structure which represents a unit which will continually spawn after set times in waves, those units will (usually) all spawn at the same time and without any control from the player, will run towards the enemy base, attacking your enemy's army as it encounters them. As time progresses and you farm more and more resources, your army gets bigger and so does your enemy's. Certain units counter certain other units so it's really up to the teams to figure out how to counter their enemy and destroy their base first. It's a huge amount of fun and very addictive.Unfortunately, this game just has no heart at all. It's a 1v1 tug of war which will basically wear out your left mouse button as all you do is click repeatedly to create a unit. It's created instantly and there are no waves. There is, however, a spawn cooldown. It's short but it's there, which means rather than armies pushing each other in waves, you get long strings of individual ships which may or may not gather up if they stop to fight. Ships will not automatically spawn either; you click on their build icon and they spawn there once and that's it.Incredibly boring and nothing compared to the custom mods you get in those games. I would say that if you have never played a game like this before, this might be a nice cheap (if you get it on sale) place to start. If you have Warcraft/Starcraft and want something similar to Desert Strike or Black and white, don't bother; this can't compare."

That's roughly all this game does.  You upgrade the ships, make different ships, and use magic on occasion, but there doesn't feel like there's any strategy to this game.  Keep upgrading, keep clicking to make new ships, eventually you win.I suppose for $3 what do you expect?  They could at least make the battles look interesting.  Have some dogfighting or something instead of lining up and shooting at eachother."

Most choices are obvious.For example at the start of 95% of the battles you should start by building as many miners as possible, why not start with this allready built and start with more interesting decisions.Then battles ""strategy"" is often upgrade one of your units to max tech, then built as many of this type (plus a few of the other types as support).There are 3 factions, with differents units and perks. But again this has little impact on strategy, and play the same.Each faction as only 6 ships and 3 special power.It tooks me 4 hours to complete the campaign, only one of the scenario was really challening and required a careful strategy , then 1 hour to try the various skirmish modes.And now there are little replay value.Production is fine and the game run smoothly, but for content wise this feels like a draft (even for a casual game).

,Recommended,304670,15821297,"Posted: 14 May, 2015",all,kschang77,"Aeon Command can be thought of as a remake of the old strategy game ""Rescue Raiders"", albeit, in a sci-fi context. As a result, the commands are vastly simplified, and combat is fast. The problem is the AI relies on timing. If you build your ships in the wrong order, you're likely to lose and have no way to recover other than to die and start over, at least against AI. On the other hand, the multiplayer capability makes games a bit more unpredictable. All in all, you should at least give this game a try.The combat in Aeon Command is simple: you do NOT give orders to your ships. They know to engage the enemy. Instead, your job as commander is the build the units and/or deploy special abilities such as EMP, repair, and so on. There are variety of units, from simple fighters to long-range bombers to shield-bearers, and a few other units.You don't group ships yourself. Instead, by building them together (close in time) they will congregate and fight as a group themselves. However, this means you have to let resources accumulate to the level when you can build them in quick succession rather than building them one at a time but somehow hold them back until your signal.You do need to gather some resources, which are some asteroids near your mothership. You simply build a few miners (usually, one per asteroid, with one or two spares to account for travel time) and they'll do their jobs. The problem is, when enemies get too close, they will shoot at your mothership and the miners, and if you lose the mothership it's game over. And there's no way to repair the mothership should it suffer damage (but repair works on the small crafts).The overall objective is to conquer the map by destroying the other side's mothership, of course.The main problem with this game is while it plays fast, after a certain point the game's already won or lost, and there's little point to force it to continue. In other words, if you already look like you're losing, then you indeed are and there's no way you can ""dig"" yourself out of a huge hole.With multiple factions (each with some unique abilities), dozens of battle scenarios, multiplayer, Aeon Command is an interesting take on the space strategy genre with inspiration from old classic. If you value a simple and fast tactical strategy combat game, Aeon Command may scratch that itch. it's not complex, nor does it pretend to be."
76561197991466989,Recommended,304670,15411061,"Posted: 17 April, 2015",all,Marikhen,"Aeon Command is one of those games that's fun in small doses, and with its low price it's actually worth paying for those doses.  The graphics are certainly more than adequate to do the job, and the audio fits the art style and theme of gameplay.The gameplay, however, won't win any awards for depth or breadth.  You spam numbers/clicks to build ships, use different keys/clicks to use special abilities, determine which ships to unlock and/or upgrade, and click on icons in the combat window to get resource, upgrade, or energy bonuses.Likewise the campaign is nothing to write home about.  You get a set number of missions which each introduce a new ship or skill, do the same number of missions for each race, or game mode, and that's it.  The campaign is little more than a tutorial for skirmish games.Skirmish, on the other hand, is where the game both shines and shows its worst flaw.  You get to play with all the races, all the game modes, all the range options, and even mix things up so that you and/or your enemy get a random assortment of ships and special abilities.  You could, for example, get the mining craft from race A which costs 8 resources to build (the others cost 10), a healer ship, a chain lightning ship, a railgun ship, and so on.  It will never randomly assign ships outside of their assigned slot so that you'll never get 2 or 3 ships normally in slot six, but it suffices to provide some variety in gameplay.  The game also provides three ""difficulty"" modes, and that is where the game's biggest flaw comes into play.The AI cheats, at least on Hard difficulty.  It doesn't cheat by being ""smarter"" or by reacting faster to changes than a human can, nor do AI-controlled ships do any better when run by an AI player than a human.  Instead the developers opted to give the AI bonuses to resource acquisition.  Either it gets a steady stream of the crystals and energy or it gets a significant boost to how much it gets when it gets it.This isn't a case of me being a bad player and blaming it on the game, nor is it a case of not understanding how the game works.  It's simply a matter of observing the facts.  When the AI is producing more ships than I can despite having the same number of collection ships out, and when the AI can use 55 energy skills/powers before I even have 1 energy, the AI is, in fact, cheating.  Edit:  I found a perfect example of the sort of benefits the AI gets over players.  As a player, I only get energy from killing enemy ships, but despite the AI having destroyed none of my ships it was able to pop off two EMPs and a Repair, total cost around 100 energy, at a time when I had only 17 energy, and this was less than four minutes into the game.Over the course of half a dozen games against a Hard AI using the Cyborg race I had one of my first three combat ships mind controlled when I had 0 energy, the ship had just been produced, and while it was in range of my base ship and thus nowhere near enemy lines.  Furthermore, during my last play session I used Cheat Engine four times to bump my credits up by 1k, 1.5k, 2k, and 2.5k, and the first three were not enough to build and upgrade enough ships to give me a fighting chance.  It wasn't until I did the 2.5k bump that I had enough, and enough upgrades, to fight the AI with some degree of parity.  Eventually I won by spamming the slot 6 ship which, more often than not, can be an ""I win"" button for each race if you get a large enough swarm of them going.This sort of cheating doesn't completely ruin gameplay, but it does make me want to avoid playing against Cyborgs or playing as Cyborgs on Hard.  Still, at $2.99 I'm more than willing to cut the developers some slack on shipping the game with a ""difficulty"" option that, at least for me, makes certain race/gameplay/side combinations absolute no-nos.  It's still something that should be considered if that sort of thing really irritates you.  The game is still quite fun up until Hard, and even on Hard as long as I play Human or Exile it's still quite enjoyable and winnable."

This strategy game relies on your knowledge of the opposing team's ships, and your own upgrades and ships in order to win. Once the campaign is complete however, the game can become extremely repetative, especially when you work out the strengths and weakness's of each team. The harder difficulty can become very easy to beat, and to complete the acheivements I found myself grinding against the hardest opponents, and beating them in 5 or so minutes. For those people who collect Perfect games (100% complete), this game can be completed around 6-7 hours. The most humerous part of this game is the fact that I was defeated on the tutorial (my only defeat), as I was reading the text on screen not realising that the opposing team was building up and preparing to attack (a very steap learning curve there :3). The gameplay itself is a tug-of-war style, and once you figure out the basic game mechanics somewhat less a tug-of-war as a slaughter-your-opponent. It is unforunate that the online multiplayer option is dead, as I think that a human opponent may be quite fun with this game.This game is worth the price, I had fun."

It's not a particularly complex, or in-depth strategy game, but to those who enjoyed the flash game Age of War, it will be entertaining.  The interface allows keyboard commands, which increases playability significantly.  There are campaigns to go through, but my favorite part is playing scramble in scenario mode, where each unit is randomly selected front one of the playable races.  It's generally a resource management game, where you try to mine as much as possible and upgrade your units as fast as possible while keeping the enemy at bay so you can eventually overwhelm them.  It is surprisingly replayable, because there are times that I have had matches lasting 3 minutes, and sometimes they last 10.  I would recommend this game as an intermitten time waster, because if you sit down and drill through, you will beat this game very quickly."

And for that, it does it well.PROS:-Campaign that walks you through all the mechanics of the game in an easy to understand way-Nice and simple art that gets the job done.-Performance is good. Runs smoothly on my 2012 laptop.-Has three different modes and three different factions. Also gives you the option of scrambling all the units and factions together in skirmish mode (1 on 1 against the AI)-Steam achievements that force you to play in a few ways you would not normally do.CONS:-Lacks variety of gameplay. The three types of skirmish modes are not that different from each other-Inability to control ships. You are mainly making strategic decisions on what and when to build. You also have some tactical decisions to make when using small perks/abilities like healing, nuking, etc.-Limited tactical/strategic depth. The most you'll get out of this is scrambling your units in skirmish mode and figuring out the best strategy to use the mix of units-Less tug of war and more ""quick momentum""  type game. You can rarely recover from a bad decision and once the AI takes advantage it's basically over.-Multiplayer is nonexistentOverall it's a good casual time waster. It looks nice and I like to play it for 15 minutes or so when I'm listening to podcasts or music. Judging from a casual game perspective it's a good buy. Otherwise, just get it in a bundle or on a good sale."

,Not Recommended,304670,25196679,"Posted: 27 August, 2016",all,aruvin,"Aeon Command developed by Bat Country Games & released on 3rd July 2014 for the PC version. It has an average user score of 6.8 on Metacritic(http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/aeon-command)& is categorized under the ""Strategy"" genre.You'd be surprised to find out that Bat Country Game is an independent game company comprising of only  2 developer. Does Aeon Command live up to it's promises? Marketed as a strategy space game, collect resources and fight among 3 faction to take control of Aeon Nebula. As a RTS *PC* gamer, I will cry foul over the game's description but coming from a mobile device gamer, I certainly welcome Aeon Command. Does that sound confusing? Read on to be enlightened!The controls are very simple. You can play the entire game by just using Mouse clicks. You also have keyboard shortcut keys to execute production of units/skills on the fly.The visuals are just fine for me. This is a 2D space battle game. The space background & the ambient sound sets the tone for being in space. Each faction will have different designs of ships. Each ship will have different animations and audio for their weapons. The User Interface is kept simple and clean. Nothing fancy/cluttered.The StoryAs the game is marketed, there is  3 faction to choose from in the campaign mode, each having 8 levels - so making it a total of 24 levels. At the beginning of each level, you will be given a balloon message that describes the story@scenario to you - and what follows after that is..well a tug of war of endless wave of space crafts.You practically try to overwhelm your enemy by mass producing space crafts and the ships will fly to the other end of the map trying to blow up the other faction's mother ship by themselves. You have no ability to control them. You only can decide the sequence of space craft to build. That's it. It is a 1 Lane tug of war and the best part is that you will be doing the same exact thing for 24 times regardless of the ""story"".Sure, there are a few levels with twist in the story, take for an example where you have to survive for x minute against the cyborg faction who are sending endless suicidal crafts. After X minute, you'll have to eliminate them.  It's just sending 1,000,000 space craft to the other side of the map. for 24 times! Do not be mistaken, this is not a MOBA or Tower defense. The exact description would be a 1 Lane control. That's it.You must be wondering how is this even possible for a game with such dull, uninteresting, repetitive game play is receiving ""very positive"" feedbacks on steam? For a RTS fan, you certainly would be utterly disappointed. There is very little ""Strategy"" involved. It's designed to be as a macro level management kind of game. One that is more suited/geared towards casual gamers. Its ""fun"" when you can overwhelm your opponent with 1 gazillion space craft. especially on multiplayer.Aeon Command gives players the option to upgrade your space crafts and also your factions(think of it like a faction bonus). The spacecraft may look and feel different however they will always remain in the same ""type of class"" for every faction.Your first space craft will always be a close range combat craft followed by a long range craft and then a support craft (healing/shield/disabler etc). It may feel slightly different from each faction but that's the general concept. It's not like starcraft/warcraft/red alert/supreme commander where you really have different kind of units! Even plant vs Zombie has more ""strategy"". I am sorry but that's how I feel/see this product as.On multiplayer, you have  3 game mode:Classic: Your typical normal game.Close: Your typical normal game but with an inch closer to each other.Resource: Your typical normal game with no-cap limit on your harvester unit.I don't understand the minor differences in Close and Resources mode. Is this the best the design could come up with? The game engine limitation? If this was a tug of war, the close mode is like having a shorter rope by an inch and for the resource mode, you can have endless of people to pulling the rope. It may sound like a visible idea but in reality, the result doesn't mean anything! There is no difference in strategy/approach of playing. I always perform the same step - across all faction - on all level difficulty.My SummaryAeon Command is a straightforward game - which can be fun - however for any serious RTS fan, stay clear of this title, it is not what it's marketed to be. For me, the story is non-existent. There is little strategy. No, I dont take upgrades as strategy. The game play was uninteresting. Some flash games could even provide me with better gaming experience/fun. Overall, I had a dull gaming experience. Do I want to see another game made with this concept/game design? No! On the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for Aeon Command is a 4/10.I am sorry Bat Country Game, you'd have to do better than this. The product feels like a flash game with uninteresting value. No replay value. No challenge. If there was an option for players to secure some sort of critical resource point, or upgrading the ship with different abilities (not just increase the damage or hp), the ability to move your mother ship for base expansion - something that can get player to engage with the game - so that players can feel some sort of strategy is involved, introduce new game mode in campaign apart from obliterating your opponent; escort mission, reconnaissance, explore other planets/moons/etc maybe? Anything but a dull straightforward obliterating your opponent 24 times. TWENTY FOUR TIMES! T.TI didn't even get a chance to interact with a faction; no interaction at all apart from blowing them to bits. Story telling department leaves much to be desired. I am speechless at this point. I don't dislike this product, in fact I want to see a better version. I hope you can think this through for your future games because you are an  independent game company, you are not bound/tied to other company restrictions. You have the freedom to develop something in your vision. Good luck in DYE & I hope to see something interesting/fresh from you."

If you don't make the correct ships at the right time, then it can cost you a lot of wasted resources, and an injection of resources or energy from your destroyed ships.It still needs work, though. For one, the tutorial is just an extremely basic overview of everything, and the actual tutorial is in the campaign. So I would recommend to make the CURRENT ""campaigns"" into the tutorials, and make the campaigns more difficult as you progress, with maybe even some changes in rules sometimes to give some missions a bit more of a challenge. It would also be great for tooltips to exist, or at least a ""library"" of sorts with each ship's information. Perhaps give the game some more visual flair to make it look better.All in all, it's still a pretty good game.

Each race also has their own mission mode. These missions throw some minor variable at you of various difficulty, but it usually comes down to spamming the right ships as well as spending upgrade points earned in previous missions or freeplay.Is this game hard?

The game is interesting and engaging, but once you've completed the campaign there's really not much of anything to do.  Getting to 100% is a mind-numbing grind and replayability just isn't that fun.Pros:- Campaign is fun- Each faction is unique and fun to playCons:- There's a huge bug where your upgrades like auto-mining and auto-energy generation don't work at all.  I'm not sure, but this could also mean that all other Gear-related upgrades don't work either - the mining and energy related ones are the only ones that give a visual indicator of whether they're working or not.- Due to the above, your only chance of beating the ""Hard"" AI in skirmish mode is to rush them.  Then one of two things happens: You win(yay!), or more likely the enemy starts spamming energy skills which makes it impossible to beat them.  ""Hard"" AI seems to have an unlimited amount of energy or generates energy extremely quickly - you cannot compete if it starts using energy skills.- You need 360 Gears to max out all upgrades.  You can earn maybe 4-7 in a ""Medium"" AI skirmish, and 5-7.  So you're looking at probably 70-90 rounds.  After doing the campaign and some skirmishes, I'm sitting at 34 wins, 0 losses, and nowhere close to finishing all the upgrades.- Replayability just isn't fun.  You spam the same build orders, upgrade chain, etc.  Once you find a good starting order of things, it's just the same thing over and over and over and over and over.  With the goal of 360 gears in mind....it's just too much."

You read some text and then try some things in the real game.  You do this for a bit.  Problem is, the enemy is building up forces while you're reading and learning!  The enemy killed me way before the tutorial was over, so I couldn't do anything but quit! The text I was reading and the game over screen were mixed together making it unreadable!  LMAO!!!  Great tutorial dev's! lolI played a skirmish after the good laugh that I had, but it was a constant tug-of-war game.  I had to quit the skirmish too as either side was not going to win and it got really boring and repetitive.  I did not play the campaign yet.There really isn't much to do other than click on buttons to build ships, upgrade your ships and mine for resources to build more ships, which is also automatic.  Your ships move towards the enemy mothership and try to destroy it automatically and the enemy is doing the same.  That is where the problem lies with this game.  Since you cannot control your ships, you can't stock them up.  Plus there is a pause between building ships, so your ships are sent out one at a time and usually get killed.  It's a bad design choice IMO.Graphics and sound are okay.  Sometimes the battles are fun to watch.  You do get a few defensive weapons that you control.   You just seem to never build up enough ships fast enough to win and neither does the enemy.  I recommend this game to space combat junkies!

76561197998647125,Recommended,304670,20380773,"Posted: 7 January, 2016",all,Ominousfiber,"A tug of war that would be heinous if priced higher, but at 3$ without discounts, it's a good buy.Pros:Provides quite a bit of gameplay for its price tag.Cons:Enemy AI is overpowered in skirmish. Simply put, they get resource ramps, multiplied by difficulty, that results in an un-fun, artificial (not influenced by your gameplay or strategy whatsoever) challenge on anything higher than easy.Matchmaking is non-existent due to lack of players.Abilities, the sole direct influence you have on the battlefield, are unnecessary if you know which ships to build and upgrade. The AI abuses them with nearly unlimited amounts of energy on anything above easy.Completionist achievement expects entirely unrealistic amount of time devoted to harvesting skirmish wins for upgrades.Why do I recommend it with such glaring flaws? My played time and $3."

The differences between each race is surprisingly significant - understanding the interaction between ship types and special abilities makes victory a lot easier.The upgrades are a bit bland, but still fun to get. The campaign seemed to get pretty brutally difficult at certain points, until I earned enough upgrades through skirmish to make more progress. Not a bad thing, just makes the upgrades seem less like advantages, and more like ""you must be this upgraded to proceed"".All in all, a solid little game."

While feels kind of like a mobile port, and has a few exploits,  this game is still really fun! Multilplay is suprisingly well done, and the main game is really enjoyable. It isn't particularly hard, minus a few difficult spots. The graphics and music create a gorgeous atmosphere that ranges from intense, to relaxed. Overall, a solid 8/10."

,Recommended,304670,29429464,Posted: 22 January,all,Sembiance,"It's a fun little quick game. Almost kinda like plants vs zombies, but without placing anything (ships auto attack). I was hoping for a bit more depth to the customization of the ships and a slightly longer campaign, and wished the three races were a bit more different from each other, but all in all, a quick little game that was enjoyable to play."

Very relaxing and rewarding to play, doesn't take a lot of concentration, very well executed.On the fun, annoying, and tedious scale, it is all on the fun side."
