I've playerd the IOS Version of the game and really like it, so i had to check it out. When i watched the trailer i was in shock with how much better the Graphics were compared to the IOS Version.  I bought the game thinking that it would have better detail, new planes, and more missions espicially with the price tag of $9.99.  I was wrong, when i played it for the first time i noticed that everything was exactly the same in comparison to the IOS Version. I was deeply disappointed knowing that i wasted $9.99 for a game that i already had for $0.99. Im not saying that Sky Gamblers is a bad game but i dont recommend the PC version when you can get the game for $0.99 on IOS."

Nothing against those games, but sometimes I just don't have the time to devote to them.Sky Gamblers turned out to be the game I was looking for.  It's easy to pick up and play, has a good variety of planes and combat scenarios, and it also supports joysticks.  After a short tutorial that teaches you the basics, you're off!The graphics aren't going to push a 980ti to it's limits, but the game still looks good.

And there is only one reason for it, too hard to learn and play.Saying this, I was quiet intrigued with this game just because it looks fun. Let me tell you I was spot on. You do not have to remember how to start an engine and all the rest. All you have to do is to push up the throttle and you get to the fight within a minute and shoot planes. “RIGHT NOW AT 3 O’CLOCK!”All fighter planes from the era are well represented in this game. Graphically, this game could have been better but you can’t have everything. To be honest they are decent.For the controls side of it, I think using the mouse and keyboard is about as weird as it sounds. It will take you a little time to master both setups anyway.You can play as a single player and have 3 campaigns at your disposal (Pacific, Africa and Battle of Britain). You also have a survival, capture the flag, dogfight, team deathmatch and defend the base which can be played against the AI. Multiplayer mode is also available.Positives:~~~~~~~~-	Challenging and really fun to play-	Plenty of modes including multiplayer-	Runs smoothly-	Stack of achievements-	Trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~-	Controls slightly sluggishOverall, this game is worth $9.99 and I really enjoyed it!8/10MORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HEREFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE"
,Recommended,304910,14140754,"Posted: 24 January, 2015",all,ƸӁƷ ♥Hot Lips♥ ƸӁƷ,"Time for yet another review...well Sky gamblers: Storm Raiders has some good and bad points but then that's the same with many games made today, Firstly some good points the graphics are fair (medium) the music very good and gameplay is good too, There are plenty of missions to do and multiplayer is good too.It has a score system to increase rank and unlock new planes which you get from completing missions and shooting down planes or sinking ships or destroying buildings also the maps are not too bad.The game has easy controls which would suit any age.Now some bad points...Firstly i noticed when you play in free flight the maps seems to be always at night which i dislike as you have to strain your eyes to see what is in front of you and this is bad programming would of been nice if you had a feature in the settings to choose night or day.Also i find the guns are not accurate (you don't have to be 100% on your target with your sights to shoot him down) also they jam up too soon and very often.Also i notice when you unlock planes sometimes you unlock a plane you already have unlocked would of been better if you unlocked a improved version of the same plane such as better defence better guns and better roof limit and so on.Wish there was a feature for a MAP to open up and see everything and where you are located and your objectives and the enemy.My Suggestions....Would of been nice if there was also a Medal feature for outstanding bravery and achievements in line with the plane you are flying at the time...Example if flying ME109 you would get geman medals if flying a spitfire British medals and so onAlso would of been nice to get money for destroying planes/ships/buildings and completing missions to buy upgrades for your planes.Also to interact with your wingmen to promote them and improve their planes and award them medals too.So i hope there will be changes to this game and improvements with patches but as it stands i can only give this game 7.5/10 which is about average score"

So far I think the only cause of mission failure is that you get shut down (duh.) or crash into something (if you're THAT stupid at all,) so complete scenarios in your own pace.Planes are well-modeled, the only bad part of this game I can think of will be the landing... stop inches above runways or decks and you can like drop onto the ground, that feels just wrong.

I knew it was arcade, but it is a whole new level of airplane arcade: you'll shoot down dozen of planes on a single fight, not to say an entire mission. The feel is not there for me.

When I was in school, one of my favorite games for the PS2 was Secret Weapons over Normandy. This game feels similar with a bit more contol, which is a good thing. There are lots of planes to unlock, ranging from early WWII fighters to jets that came in toward the end of the war. Different campaigns have you flying planes from both Allied and Axis sides. Combat is fast and fun. The music is pretty decent.If you're a person who needs every single aspect of flight rendered in perfect scientific detail, this game might not be for you, but if you're like me and you love WWII planes, this game is a great investment for only 10 USD. If you get it when it's on sale, even better!Cons to be aware of:No voice acting. All mission prompts are via text on screen. My vision sucks so I missed some.Several planes, but it feels like more could have been added. 99 cent DLCs with 5-8 planes would be nice.Music can get a bit repetitive, but you don't notice if you're fighting.I can't figure out how to lower landing gear."

The game is actually smoother on the PC than on my phone, and the total lack of IAP's in the Steam version makes it worth the price. some of the planes in the game on IOS,OSX, and Android store versions are purchase only, as well as being charged for the ""weapon hanger"" which allows you to customize weapons and limited Paint packs which allow you to customize the paint on your plane. The steam version requires some unlocking (the baddest planes in the game require you to beat the last dogfight mission to get them rather than a purchase of $2-3 apiece.)

,Recommended,304910,15065533,"Posted: 26 March, 2015",all,kschang77,"Sky Gamblers: Storm Raiders is the third game in the Sky Gambler series, previously released as mobile games. As a result, this is turn-and-burn only, but for a WW2 turn and turn, it's surprisingly fun and decently balanced with some interesting complexities should you wish to delve into such.For a mobile port, this game is actually quite good. Terrain and flying area is nice and big, objects are not oddly scaled (things are tiny in a distance). Details are not PC standard, but quite workable. Enemy planes break apart when you kill them, with a wing falling off, then the whole things spins and twists like a falling leaf. And so on. Ground targets can hide among trees but that's why you have rockets and bombs. Or for naval targets, you have torpedoes and bombs.The engine can be ""boosted"" for a short period of high speed, but engine will overheat after X seconds, and may shut down altogether (but it will restart once you cooled off). Guns will also overheat and prone to jamming should you held down the trigger for too long. The temp gauge on either weren't too obvious though.There's quite a bit of decent single player content (2-3 campaigns, plus survival mode and dogfight mode) as well as full set of mulitplayer games including Capture the Flag, Free for All, and so on. There's also three difficulty levels so rookies can feel free to dive right in.Don't expect too much realism, as you have P-40 Warhawks fighting the Luftwaffe, or Hurricane carrying torpedoes, and so on. A fighter here do often carry bombs. And many of the scenarios have you attempting to race to the airfield before your fuel runs out on a timer, not on actual fuel consumption. On the other hand, they can be quite exciting, and these missions do have checkpoints so if you fail, you aren't forced to start from the beginning.Controls are easy enough, though the gamepad support should be better, as there needs to be some custom mapping. For games that supports such, I do ""RC controls"" (i.e. stick one controls elevator and roll, while stick two controls throttle and rudder) and this game was able to do such, but it wasn't the default.On some game types you can customize your plane, both paint job and the primary/secondary weapons, and choices are plenty, some are good for ground work, some are good for air attacks.With four classes of planes (fighter, bomber, jet, and legend), there are plenty of choices and lots of customization options. Legend class contains very iconic fighters as well as some prototypes that never made it into service but were very good planes.The interface is a little weird as often you have to rely on dragging to show more panels as there are no obvious signs there are more choices below; legacy of coming from a touch interface.All in all, SGSR is a pretty good game, for the turn-and-burn crowd. Don't expect ""realism"", flight model, and so on."

I personally play it with a joystick and I have to say for a phone port this game has better joystick response than War Thunder when last i played that game.  I had no trouble mapping buttons or with responsiveness in Storm Raiders compared to the buggy and mouse bias War Thunder which is a flight simulation game.  That aside I really have been enjoying this game.Pros:-Very easy to fly, it's just throttle up and you're off, this is an arcade game after all.-3 Difficulty settings.-Simple 3 modes wingman support: Attack / Defend / Formation-Multiple control types supported, works great with a flight stick. (I use the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro)-Good graphics, effects, & atmosphere music with the exception of one of the campaign missions.-Larger scale air battles with large maps, you'll get into some decent furballs here.-Three short campaigns filled with fun as well as several solo game modes that mimic the multiplayer games.-Active multiplayer online matches. (Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, & Destroy the Base.)-Unlimited bullets with a heat mechanic, recharged rockets/bombs/torpedos mechanic. (Also a con for those who want realism.)-Toggle Aim Assist, personally I found it easier with this disabled as I could kill enemies from outside the lead que range.-New aircraft are earned by completing the campaigns and leveling up, you don't have to purchase them like the phone version.Cons:-There's only one internal cockpit model used in every plane, very sad. :(-The campaigns are pretty short, about 5-6 missions long each it wont take long to finish them. (Also a pro for casuals.)-For those that like realism, there's unlimited ammo & a radar system. (Again, it's an arcade game.)-The physics are not the greatest but only really is bothersome when landing, if you cut your engine by boosting too much, or running out of fuel via campaign event. (There is no actual fuel consumption.) My first landing in this game dropped me dead from 2 meters up for a successful three point landing vtol style.  If you want a more realistic landing don't try to coast, go in low at 50% and grind the ground, wheels deploy automatically and then drop the throttle back. When you run out of fuel or kill your engine (temp only) you quite literally will start to drop straight down shortly after, there is no gliding in this game.Really there isn't a whole lot about this game that bothers me, I really like flight games like the Ace Combat series up to game 5. (Assault Horizon was just a disappointment.)  While this game isn't an Ace Combat with an amazing story I found the gameplay engaging and fun.  At $9.99 I feel the game is well worth it."

For instance, fly upside down while playing, does the aircraft begin descending or does it fly straight as if in space with no resistance or drag? To some this may seem trivial, but to me i use this gravity to my advantage in dogfighting and most importantly, it adds immersion. Give it a try its a good game and i recommend it bc the developers look like they cared for this game and did a pretty good job for an arcade game. I bought this seeing the simulation tag and i believe that should be removed so as not to confuse others who are expecting a more simulating experience."

,Recommended,304910,13894203,"Posted: 8 January, 2015",all,MindTheMugger,"View my first playthroughHereThis Arcade-style dogfighting game is a nice change from the horde of twitch-shooters currently on the market. It's one of those easy-to-learn-hard-to-master games that seems simple at first, but over time you'll learn there is depth to the combat. With close to 30 planes, all with varying stats and play-styles, you'll find something you like. The single player places you in one of three theatres of war across the globe during WWII. The difficulty ranges from♥♥♥♥♥♥easy to OMFG-EJECT EJEC-(explosion). You'll fly sorties for the British and the Americans fighting against Germany and Japan, all while utilizing various frames: fighter, bomber, and special role planes. Each with there own unique weapons. Frames are unlocked by perfoming  campaing missions or playing multiplayer. The weapon and plane specifications could use an EXPLINATION, however. I'm not sure what some of these symbols mean, but I'm sure there is a wiki on it somewhere. Multi-player is fun and has several modes: capture the flag, defend the base, deathmatch, team deathmatch, last-man-standing, survival (horde, you and team versus NPCs) and even a free-flight mode for the achievment horses to mingle! In a market thourghly saturated with hyper-violent, grim and sexual content, this game is a breathe of fresh air. I would feel comfortable letting my kids play this game.Final verdict: this game is good, not great, but with patching it has the potential for excellence.

I don't think it deserves all of the hate it is getting because the graphics look exactly like the phone game. The game is compatible with a joystick which adds a whole new insite to the game. The keyboard controls (in my opinion) are a lot easier to control than tilting your phone everywhere. It can be played on bigger screens with better fps.

,Recommended,304910,33407385,Posted: 9 July,all,hitsman4u,Sky Gamblers: Storm Raiders gets a definite 4/5 from me with only a couple of minor faults to complain of. In general though I have found the game entertaining and action packed with three Campaign categories which can be played at one of three levels: Rookie/Pilot or Ace. The variety of aircraft is good although all seem to share the same Messerschmitt Bf-109 cockpit and once unlocked via playing the campaigns they can be used online where the multiplayer appears to be far from dead. Features a free flight and a number of combat situation modes putting you up against AI aircraft which are marked clearly with target indicators when playing at easy levels. The only problems to report are that at times the AI aircraft and multiplayer aircraft do not manoeuver smoothly and that as you manoeuver your aircraft particularly at high speed the blackout effect kicks in annoyingly and that this cannot be disabled. I just found this frustrating during dogfight and survival missions as it blacks out all target indications as well as the screen. You literally cannot see a thing even when playing at easy levels and this could serve as an impediment to learning the game / learning the different types of aircraft and what they are capable of. Definitely worth the GBP £4.99 spent on it though.

I like arcade versus simulation arcade flight combat games (think Crimson Skies), but this is just too arcade like for my tastes. The combat seems like shooting down swarms of mosquitos. I think this would be fine on a table or phone, but for playing with a PC on a joystick it just does not cut it. On the other hand, the graphics are find, it is well exectuted, and the controls are done well. Its not my style of game, but it may be just what you wanted."

It's actually a little too easy at times and you can fly through the levels (no pun intended). I think I finished the whole game in maybe 2-3 hours. All there is left after that is online matches, but that's not very fun because the only thing that matters is getting teh last shot in."
