,Recommended,304930,30219144,Posted: 27 February,all,(Obey) obeyo1,"Unturned is phenomenal game. The fact that this game has been developed by a 16 year old astonishes me. The aesthetics suit the game. Yes, the graphics are not great. However, I think, it should stay like this. It gives the game an identity. When I first played the game, I was not expecting much. I wasn't expecting a full on tactical rpg, or a racing game, or a base build survival co op, or a PVP open world deathmatch. I wasn't expecting any of these. Yet, it offered all of this. Survival is very rewarding. However, be warned, your stuff can vanish depending on the server. Dont get too attached to your items. Sandbox servers are the best as they allow you to do anything you want.Unturned is a blast, you can really do anything. However, the community can be very toxic sometimes. Depending on how you look at it. In conclusion: The game does no other triple A game has done. H1Z1 and DayZ don't feel that friendly. Unturned feels friendly to new comers. Just bring a friend and scavenge the post apocalyptic environment.Surprisingly there is lore in the world of Unturned. I'll leave you to discover the hidden lore."

,Not Recommended,304930,29964310,Posted: 16 February,all,Arden Proxy,"You may ask: ""How can you NOT recommend a game you've spent such a large amount of time playing?""- Well, it's because of the time I've spent on Unturned that I feel that I am more than qualified to say: ""it's absolutely f#cking sh#t!""A once brilliant game that has ironically fallen to the greed driven, poorly thought through changes made by the developers as they attempt to cater to, and milk, the increasingly intolerable prepubescent community on which Unturned is built.Unturned has become a stale, filtered, dull, lifeless shadow of it's former self. A game plagued by unneccessary 'novelty updates' sourced from the devs' chronic fear of their audience losing interest.The game has taken a steep turn away from competetive survival PvP that characterised it in it's early days, with each new update over the last year (2016) serving only to remove another quality of Unturned that I'd grown to love in the past. I've spent a thousand hours enjoying one key element of Unturned that I've always felt was most defiining of it, the 'Spawn, Gear, Die, Rush' sequence. Essentially, you spawn fresh into a server, you find gear to personalise yourself and weaponary, you get killed by another player, and a state of panic ensues as you desperately attempt to regain your hard earned gear that has taken you so long to ecumulate. This sequence, though frustrating, was what made Unturned thrilling, giving players a constant state of fear of attack as they interacted with the map and other players. Yet the devs have removed this sequence, and all forms of gameplay that it complimented, because it is less appealing to the dominant demographic of children.I suppose you think I'm salty. Well... I am. I enjoyed Unturned, as much as I have any other game, but it's been distorted beyond recognition from the game which I, and many others, loved years ago. Don't waste your time on it."

,Recommended,304930,11358406,"Posted: 22 July, 2014",all,Mitchell,"This is a fun basic game but it feels really unfinished.What I find weird about this game is that there's no goal, just to get stuff and live and the whole point is to be a DayZ / Minecraft type game.The thing that makes Minecraft so everlastingly fun is that it's an infinite sandbox game and you can build almost anything, in this game you can't build anything at all.Also unlike DayZ you can't fly in the helicopters and planes which are scattered around this map, if you could fly these the game would be much more fun.However there are some upsides, obviously for one the game is free and you don't need a beast of a computer to run it. (although it's not optimized very well)It's very fun to play with friends however you either need to find a server on a list or host your own.I think this game has potential but hasn't quite reached it yet, hopefully the game will be much better when it's finished.6/10"

,Not Recommended,304930,29610722,Posted: 31 January,all,Albus,"I think you can say I've played this game for quite a bit with over 1050 hours of gameplay, so you might be asking why am I righting a negative report? Back in Unturned 2.0 when this game first came out, it was not the only multiplayer open world apocalyptic survival game out there, but it was different from DayZ and H1Z1. Unturned wasn't a hobby it was a lifestyle, I know it sounds crazy but there would be these crazy vibes like getting up on a cold december morning on a snowday and skipping breakfast to just play unturned with all your friends. But later as the game developed on it turned into more of a game like DayZ and H1Z1, I think that the developer is doing a great job with his game despite being a student in school. But only recently I think that this game has taken a turn. First off you can't be very creative, building bases is boring, if you take a game like minecraft, you can do anything to hide a base because you could build secret trap doors and cool little things like that. Also Unturned is getting very repititve. The whole sequence of a unturned pvp server is:1) Build a base2) Get raidedNo longer is it a challenge to raid bases when you could simply shoot the door with a LMG. Also the shooting and the action of this game has turned into something like BLOCKADE 3D. If you load our your skills theres no recoil on almost 75% of all full-auto guns, also adding to the third person aspect with people complaining about popshotters and stuff. Speaking of people complaining, the community is very toxic and hostile, everybody gets♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when someone raids ther sh!t-shack on top of a hill. Thats all I have to say about this game, it has turned from a great idea in the past to a game that you'll play when theres nothing else to do on a boring saturday.Final notes:Don't get me wrong, I love this game and the idea of itI've made so many friends in this game and some that I've even met with in real lifeThe platform it runs on is perfect for your dad's laptop that you play on while he's not workingLastly, Nelson Sexton the developer is a very bright kid, I love what he's done and I hope he continues what he's doing, instead I think he should listen to the community a bit more, I know his email is spammed with a bunch of 12 year olds but he needs to solve a problem here and find a way to fufill what the audiance wants.And for all of those who know me,Love your good old squeaker,Pinecone."

Game is for both Mac and PC and is just a fun game to mess around in. The workshop is also amazing for this game and makes the playing experience even better as you get to explore different mods and maps. The community is great despite encountering a few squeakers along the way, but otherwise I would recommend this game to anyone that likes zombie survival games, like Dayz, as this game is a minecraft sort of looking Dayz. The first look at the game without playing it may throw off the player, but once actually getting to play the game changes the view for the player, making Unturned a come back game for many, I almost forgot the best part, ITS FREE. All of this comes for free, I don't think it could be better than that, well if GTA 5 shark cards and GTA 5 its self was free, that would be better, but I guess you get the point. I recommend it, play it, browse the workshop and just ingeneral have fun and mess around."

76561198156520233,Recommended,304930,29474311,Posted: 24 January,all,Weezley,"So, one of my only reviews, but I figured since I've been playing this game practically since it came out I thought I would give it a try. Unturned is a post-apocalyptic FPS which takes place in a number of maps, e.g. PEI (Canada), Washington (US), Yukon (Canada), and Russia.. (Russia :P), and hundreds of others that can be downloaded from the Steam: Workshop. This game should be played (in my opinion) with multiple friends, although it is still fairly fun on your own Campaign map. I would say that Unturned is one of, or the best F2P on Steam, and if you like it enough, you can pay small fee of $5 for cosmetics and crap. So, now I'll take a look at the Pros, and Cons..Pros:The game gets updated almost everyweek or so it seems (sometime faster)It's... freeThe PvP aspect is hyper-realisticZombies are coolSimplistic graphics, and easy to runCons:There are none, from my perspectiveOverall, I would say I definitely recommend this gameto all kinds of gamers, whether you're Casual, Hardcore, or just don't know how to play games..."

You can choose to play single player and battle starvation and zombies or a multiplayer PVP server and battle players and build a base to protect your loot. You also can join a PVE server to team up with other players. The game comes out with an update every Friday, but they have been coming more often lately as a new map has just released and many bugs are being fixed in the new Hawaii map. The game also has an economy aspect much like CS:GO, you can buy or open up all kinds of skins to use, trade, or sell."

But if you happen to find a good server, with a good amount of people and good balanced kits, you are in for some good♥♥♥♥♥fun. I made about 5 accounts just to save all the items I had, and it was so good, i bought the gold edition. Not recommended, but if u want to, sure. Again, if you do not have a good wifi connection, don't play. If you do, download it right now, and play with your friends. ALso, not fun without friends. Very strategic, and thrilling. Base building is fairly easy, and one you have a good base and all the good gears, you feel so good about yourself. GET THIS GAME"

The bolt action sniper rifle, the Hawkhound, is my headhunting weapon of choice.  No matter if you're a fresh spawn or rollin' with alice packs, my shot will come from the trees and land with deadly accuracy.  3 people will be dead before you can start returning fire.  I'll circle the base and pick my shots, enjoying you squirm in fear unaware of where the next shot is coming from.  Too many of your friends are dead at this point.  You and a buddy try to fly away in your hidden helicopter.  Jokes on you, I've scoped out your base for days.  I know your patterns, I know your tricks.  Getting into a helicopter wont save you as a 200 meter shot breaks through the glass killing the pilot.  You bail knowing you have an umbrella in your inventory but the bolt is already set.  The shot is fired.  You watch your body fall to the ground from the death screen and anxiously wait for the ""Home"" button.  It's too late.  I've looted every kill.  I've gotten my prize.  Theres nothing more rewarding than feeding on the weak and watching the stack crumble, utterly helpless to the elegant power of the bolt action Hawkhound.  Oh and lettuce is probably the best food in the game, maxing out agriculture will get you 2 every harvest."

You can change it a bit so a few effects are sorta pretty but graphics honestly dont matter, makes it easier to run on a toaster. Its free and you get random drops for free. You do have to pay for the gold membership which gives you some extra features but I honestly dont bother. If you decide to play this game daily for lets say 1000 hrs then its probably worth it. Enough rambling the gameplay itself is pretty average not sluggish or anything like that it's very simple and you can level a skill tree and scavenge. As you scavenge and level your tree you unlock certain features like maybe you can build some cooler equipment, you can build a car and sniper rifle... Master craftsman.Playing with friends in an online server is the best. You drive around in a convoy and everyone admires how ♥♥♥♥ing badass you and your peeps are. One time we all jumped a ramp and the person on the bike slammed into a zombo mid air. ""Now thats a convoy hehe"" Says some random pedestrian who we later killed. Lots of different gamemodes and new content on the way so I would reccomend this game."

It is hands down one of the best free games you can possibly get.If you want a lighter rendition of the handful of good stories DayZ gave you, you'll have a blast playing Unturned, and you won't have to hold down your ""W"" key for three hours as you walk from one end of the map to the other.Also, zombies don't run through walls.Gameplay feels better despite, and perhaps because of, having a much simpler animation system.Cars are a thing.Base building is a thing.If you enjoyed the sandboxy fun DayZ offered, like me, but didn't want to pour your life into it, like me, then Unturned will give you a fun time for exactly zero dollars."

It was really addicting but now I have friends that come on, like 9 crates full of medicals, weapons, and tons of food. I have explored all of the map and know the map like the back of my hand. The addictive game sense wore off as the more i played. Everything just repeated: Get in car, go loot, come back, put in chests, plant crops, repeat. I wish he made more maps or community maps or maybe even a city map. I would love to play this game more :(.All in all: I will deffinately play this game again if he adds more to it, which I know hes not done, but for now I will say I practically 'beat' the game.

Why wouldn't I recommend it?The combat system is smooth and the lvl up system is not bad, one thing that I recal that isn't good is that the stuff dosen't respawn unless you quit and come back (Note I don't know if he did fix this or not). You can also play with you're friends which makes the game even better and build a fort!It has a workshop, so if you're bored of the same small map over and over you can always get different map made by the community and some of them are really amazing.Overall I recommend it to those who love Zombie/Survival games.

Even as I read other people's reviews I'm learning more and more about the game, things that I had no clue about. At its core, it is a survival zombie shooter, similar to rust and dayz, with crafting similar to rust, but the world is a bit more dayz-esque.What I didn't like about Rust is that despite its crafting system, there aren't many structures around to hold out in, and making a really established shelter can take a lot of time. Unturned has many towns and homes scattered around the map to hold out in and establish yourself, giving you some time to get your inventory set up so you can get out there and make your own place to live.Also, the crafting system is pretty boring, but it's not all laid out for you like it is in rust. You need to memorize recipies or look them up, which is a lot better in my opinion. You shouldn't have all your options listed for you, it completely takes out the difficulty.There's so many things that I'm leaving out, but it's like a 50 MB download, and it's free. Why aren't you trying it out for yourself right now?"

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!"

It had quite positive reviews, so I wasn't hesitant about downloading it. After installing hte game, I started it, and was greeted with lots of lag. This is in no part because of the game, it is because the computer that I own is quite slow and old. However, after playing the game, the lag decreased significantly, but the sensitivity was too high for my taste. I was expecting a fps style of gameplay, similar to Counter-Strike or Battlefield 1, but I was surprised at the FPS & Rust Hybrid syle  of gameplay that I saw. It turned me off quite a bit, but that's because it's just not my type of experience that I find enjoybale. The controls were a little weird for my taste, but the gameplzy was ok. I talked to some people that played the game, and they said the game gets a lot better when playing with people in comparision to single player or tutorials. I played some multiplayer, and the experience was great. However, even though I enjoyed it, the style of gameplay was not something I personally would enjoy.Hope this helps,SupreNoobs GamingNoob"

,Recommended,304930,29869670,Posted: 12 February,all,YZ-31,"WARNING: this is a very long review, so grab something to drink or eat while reading :)OK, this is an angry review of the game and gonna be 100% honest.The game, is good it really is, I mean the fact that this was developped by a 16 year old is amazing. however, it still has lots of bugs here and there but I'm okay with as long as it doesn't affect the gameplay. here's a small little ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review made by someone who has nothing else to do but this review, enjoy :)Awesome things about the game :- gathering loot, guns (lots of them!), medical supplies and building supplies takes time and I personaly like that.- a vast amount of vehicles- really good maps.- game constantly gets updated with more stuff!- awesome modding community.This is why I gave the review a thumbs up,HOWEVER, if you're looking for a game where you can just team up with strangers and communicate with enemies before fighting or to trade, Then I don't recommend this game at all and this  is why I'm not playing any more, the community is bad. Servers are filled with people who just don't give a ♥♥♥♥ and shoot you on sight without asking if you're friendly or not, they take all your loot, making the time you took to gather all the loot worthless. If you happen to kill them they would follow to get their loot back at all cost and just ruin the game for you (I'm speaking of experience here, it might differ for you). If you ever do manage to team up with strangers they would find a way to backstab you  the moment you least expect it (still talking from experience).time for a little story:I was playing with my cousin and we found a really friendly group that we teamed up with, we became an actual working group and all,then we found another dude who befriended us for few days, he helped us build a base, fight bandits and we trusted him, until one day we were at a campground and he told us he a had a friend waiting for him. He told us to regroup and to holster our guns, I started to doubt something and started backing off, he said ""what i wanna tell you is..."" him and his friend start shooting us, I was the first one to die because I pulled out my gun. no one from my real group survived and they took our loot.You could find people you can trust but you won't find a lot. Since most of the players are preteen kids, they will just shoot you and♥♥♥♥♥♥you off if you happen to kill them.Not to mention some servers are just abused by admins, admins who are kids and would ban you for attacking them and use god mode.One trick people use as well is remove the grass so that they can see you a mile away and would ruin your effect of surprise. I find that so annoying.And last but not least, hackers, but that's old news with BattleEye working with Unturned.All in all, it's a survival game, so I expected to kill, and to be killed but I love cooperating with survivors. Unfortunately  most of them would kill me for my loot, there's 0 cooperation if you don't play with friends.If you're like me and likes to be as realistic as possible, if you want to communicate with other groups, to wage war or make peace and to trade, this is not a game for you. It became a game where only the simple rule is to ""kill all"".The game has potential, but sadly the community ruined the game for me.Thanks for reading this long review, and have a nice day."

,Not Recommended,304930,29861015,Posted: 11 February,all,AzimuthWarning,"On the surface, Unturned looks like a neat little indie survival game and at first it seems fun. In reality, it is very dull, horribly developed, and will become boring very quickly.I've been playing this game since its inception and I originally liked it. I bought the gold membership, hoping that the money would encourage the developer to mold the game into a very playable product, however, each update leaves me more and more disappointed and the main problems of the game remain unresolved.Cons:1. By far the worst physics I've ever seen in a game. You can walk straight through many of the rocks and terrain pieces, vehicles are very jittery and get stuck very frequently on small hills/etc. Recoil on guns are extremely exaggerated even with maxed out perks, making shooting with full auto impossible (unless your goal is to miss every shot) Bullet drop on rifles is also extremely exagerated, due to the fact that your render distance is probably only a few hundred meters. Hitboxes are on zombies are terrible, especially on sprinters and crawlers. They can get many hits on you, but every swing of your sidearm won't touch them.2. Good loot is hard to come by. This can be said for all survival games, but in Unturned it can't ring more true. Finding adequate weapons, food, medicine, and clothing is a massive feat. I've searched four story buildings and found only a candy bar or a shirt. You can go for hours and hours and barely scrape up basic equipment, only to be quickly killed and set back to nothing. Some servers turn up the spawn rates and provide basic kits because of how difficult it is to find gear.3. Graphics are terrible. The textures are extremely low res, bad lighting quality, and ridiculously short render distances. I didn't mind when the game was released, indie games in alpha with poor graphics isn't something to get worked up over, but after TWO YEARS and the graphics haven't changed an iota!4. The game is horribly optimized. I have a gtx 980 and can't run this game with ""max graphics"". The most I'll get is a fluctuating 20-15 fps with no notable difference in graphics quality.5. The amazing and simple inventory in classic mode got overhauled and ruined. Originally, you had many hot bar slots where you can fill them with weapons, bandages, etc. Making healing in combat and switching weapons easy. Now, you have two hotbar slots. So if you're getting chased by zombies and run out of ammo, or have been shot and need a bandage, you have to access the inventory to change weapons or select an item. This takes 5-10 seconds because you have to dequip the things in your hotbar and move them elsewhere in your inventory before equipping something else. So you're pretty much dead if you need to grab something in a split-second.Pros.1. The game is free2. There are 42 Achievements3. Base building and crafting is actually pretty good (although it's almost a clone of Fallout 4's base building and crafting system.)

Now I've put 60 hours into this thing, its probably my favourite game (currently). Its wide variety of servers is nice because rage quitting is something I do alot :3. The sandbox and skills element of it is a nice addition in my opinion, as it gives the game a bit more depth. It has frequent updates (one every friday/saturday morning depending where you live) and they are well done and actually add things unlike other games. Variety of guns is massive, and it has custom names for all the games (e.g Zubekanov = AK47, Heartbreaker = SCAR, etc). Its hard to get bored on this game, because their is always something to do. The PvP is fast paced which is negative for some and a positive for some (personally a negative). To make up for this, PvP does take skill, not whoever fires the first shots.Would I recommend it? Yes. Unturned is a mix of a sandbox, looting locations, raiding and post-apocalyptic stuff (zombies, guns, etc). So, what are you waiting for? Download it now."

It receives very frequent updates and the community is very much involved within development.GameplayUnturned has brilliant survival PvP based gameplay. It is similar to that of DayZ and others though is unique within it's unusual art style. There are a plethora of servers to join, each boasting different community created plugins via the intergrated dev-kit. A variety of weapons, food, clothes and more get added each Friday. The community can often get involved within development by reporting bugs, asking for new features and creating mods or maps. If you find playing with others too tedious then take a seat and play some singleplayer where it's just you, the zombiesandthe recently added NPCs which will take an RPG twist to the game giving you quests to embark on. Skills can also be unlocked via killing zombies (or of course, players).GraphicsPersonally, I love the Unturned art style, it's simple, colourful and fun! Aside from the low-poly models the post processing effects are often overlooked. Cranking the settings up to 'Ultra' will make the game beautiful. Grass becomes alive, water reflects the skies and beams of golden sunlight crackle through the leaves of the trees.ControlsThe controls are generally rather easy to learn, especially with help from the tutorial, though to master them becomes difficult. I have played this game since the release of 2.0 and have not known that you could bind medkits to specific buttons on your keyboard until around 9 months ago. All controls can be changed with the intuitive UI.ConclusionIn conclusion, Unturned is a great game and is perfect for pretty much all ages as long as you overlook the blood (I'm certain this can be turned off via the options). The community revolving around it can be ugly or great depending on your choice of server and overall it is generally a perfect game that many survival genre fans like myself have been waiting for since ages."

Some RP servers are only jobs where as others are shops and survival. Third is the creatie server, kind of like minecraft you can spawn in anything you want.

,Recommended,304930,29765561,Posted: 7 February,all,Rich Chigga,"Figure I'll make a review after playing this game for a while.Unturned is a survival game about finding loot, vehicles, equiptment, building bases, fighting players, or zombies, and simply survivng as long as you can. Although the graphics are obviously not amazing, the gameplay is what makes the game fun and worthwhile. The possibilities are endless with this game, there is no set code, or way to survive you have to follow, and I really love that. Now to go in depth. (Pros and cons at bottom)LOOTING: This is actually the reason I love this game so much, unlike DayZ or Miscreated, loot is a lot easier to come by, but it's still not to the point where everybody is OP and going to kill you in a fight. You can play on Easy, Normal, or Hard mode servers, and those will determine how obviously easy it is to survive. Here's an example, I can be geared to the point of being able to defend myself from players and zombies in about 30-45 minutes, on an easy server. 10/10MAPS: There are a couple maps to choose: PEI is the smallest map with only a few cities, great for a Kit PVP server. Washington is mid-sized with many cities and landmarks, personally one of my favorites for survival. Russia is the biggest map, very great for survival, but if you don't have TPA, it can be hard to meet your friends and you may not encounter players often. On top of these maps, there is Monolith, Alpha Valley and Paintball Arena, which are all PVP arena type gamemodes (Hunger Games.)GAMEPLAY: It's so basic, but it just works, you gain experience by killing zombies and doing various basic tasks, you can upgrade your stats, such as Stamina or Accuracy. You run around and loot various locations to find loot. You can cut down trees to get wood and start a base, obtain more materials to upgrade your base. Surviving along the way, it's notn too hard, not too easy, it just works perfectly.GUNPLAY: You can obtain various attachments for your weapons (Scopes, Barrels, Grips, Etc.) You obviously must have the correct ammo for your gun and from there just aim and fire. The gunplay is nothing special, it's often just who gets more headshots and can't bandage quicker, but for a game like this, that I feel is more of an Arcade survival game, you don't really need to be so in depth with gunfights as example Arma 3, where you have to zero your scope and account for range and all.ZOMBIES: Easy mode zombies: They all are the standing kind of zombie, most of them don't take too many hits to kill. Normal Mode: This adds Laying down zombies and ones that run on all 4 and chase you faster than the others.Hard Mode: This adds zombies that can spit at you, catch you on fire and various other abilities.BASE BUILDING: Very, very simple, you just collect resources, craft a foundation, craft walls and craft a roof, then add on from there, again, very simple, but it works in a game like this.SERVERS: This is where this game has potential to be unfair, but there is nothing we can do about it. Often times what will happen is the Server owners will be admins, but disguised, and as you'd expect when nobody knows you're an admin, you spawn in gear, everybody will just think you're a great player, not an admin. As well as spawning gear a lot of them will TPA to their friends, because even if there isn't TPA plugin, admins can still teleport to players or locations. There are servers though that don't do this, it's really a rare occurance.SERVER HOSTING: You will have so much fun! Server hosting is so easy, even a fly could do it, as long as your pc can run a server, you and your friends can host private sessions, host servers with your own rules, or just test things out. It's really great, and I'm glad Nelson made hosting this easy. (Port forwarding isn't hard once you learn how to do it, and it's the same for every game except the port)WORKSHOP: Tons of cool items and maps and mods to try out.COMMUNITY: The one thing I dislike, the majority of the time the community either doesn't have a mic, or are young kids, half of which speak Spanish.PROS:Looting is not too hardGunplay is not too in depthMultiple MapsTons of ItemsEasy server hosting100% FunNo 2 experiences will be the sameCONS:Community is young kidsGraphics aren't the bestOften, whoever has better gear will be victoriousAdmins abuse power sometimesOccassional BugsOverall, for a free game, this is great. This game delivers more than some survival games I've dished out a lot of money for. Definetely try it out if you like Survival games that aren't too hardcore."

I bought the Gold Edition in 2.0, not because of the Benifits of it, but because I wanted to support the creator. I thought this game was gonna be something awesome. In 2.0 if he sold this game $20 I'd buy it, and then I'd buy it for all my friends. This game used to be so good, but with the recent updates of the Helicopter, Rocket Launchers, and the Cosmetics, it became a horrible disgusting mess. Now this game is a 10 yr Free-For-All deathmatch, with zombies. It's so dumb. I have 492 hrs in this game, and 460 of those hours were played in 2.0. I do not recommend this game to anyone, unless you wanna play ""Unturned Classic,"" but even that gets boring. 3.0 is cringey and stupid, Do not download."

The game can get very repetitive and be very boring. I used to own a very small server and all I got was non-stop hackers.My rating for this game is going to be : 3.5/10"

Unless you have a friend desperately trying to keep you playing. Once you know the loot spots, death isn't as crippling as it should be and gunfights devolve to either proning and spraying or being the kid that uses third person to look over walls and then spray you. Its a poor man's DayZ and don't be suprised if the majority of the community is just children (because it is). The 1 man dev team is impressive but it doesn't make this fun. Also it is INCREDIBLY unoptimised and can even crash your game due to RAM issues on the Russia map. The sense of distance is completely messed up in the game as well, and a 50cal sniper that can blow up a car has the max distance of 200 ""meters"" and the drop of a brick that flew threw my window. Alot of servers also have /kits which make newbies able to whip out a deagle and one shot you at any moment, but if you kill them when they don't have a deagle you're a noob who kills freshies and should be banned. The karma system is also messed up as anyone who is considered ""good"" can straight up just shoot you, but if you shoot back you will lose alot of karma which is why you see so many people with negative karma. And good karma isn't even rewarding in any way other than you being the equivilent of an internet white knight. Real score, 4/10 as I did enjoy my time with a friend but this just got so boring so quickly and the community is like 5 year olds trying to play ArmA 3 or 30 year olds who act like them. Both are very serious in a game thats basically roblox zombies interestingly enough."

Even if you suck at apocalypse-type titles, Unturned has so much more to offer, like many other games in the same genre.  But the key feature that I appreciate about Unturned so much is that the classic zombie survival format is put into a simpler form that just about any computer can run.  The textures and models, while simple, provide an effective gameplay experience and the overall feel of the game is a bit more laid back than something like H1Z1 or DayZ.  Although you can still experience the intensity of more ""immersive"" games, Unturned offers simple, easy-to-run gameplay on any type of computer, and if you're just getting into the genre of zombie survival, this is the place to start."

,Recommended,304930,30151345,Posted: 24 February,all,justsomeguytom,"To put it simple, it's a game that has incredible depth if you look behind the Roblox-ish looks.Pros:+a pretty big world+pretty much close to real survival with its amazing depth, filling needs of food, water etc.+base building, communicating with other players, this game has huge amounts of aspectsCons:-it just looks Minecraft/Roblox-esque and that may be unattractive to some gamerOverall, I suggest you look behind the looks and try this one yourself. It's free anyways, so why not try it?"

,Recommended,304930,29466289,Posted: 24 January,all,xBarronn,"Best F2P Zombie Survival Game! Very good Singleplayer but the most attractive option is playing on a multiplayer server with your friend or going to make one ingame. Fighting against other players is pretty fun and dying from their hands is not disapointing so you are still playing without that bad feelings you may have in other Unturned like titles. Requirements are really good but aren't that low as you may think... If you wanna play it in 60 FPS (on 24 players multiplayer) the ""must have"" is 4 core CPU and 4 Gigs of RAM. Graphics card is not that important,  512 MB VRAM should be enough. I hope my opinion will be helpful. I really recomend this game. If you like games like that, you must try it. You will not disapointed. I promise.PS. Sorry for my english and every mistakes i have done writing this."

I would not build in a town because zombies can spawn and damage your walls. I like playing on PVE servers, i've never tried PVP because I just die. PVE is more fun because you don't have to worry abotu people killing you, it's just if raiding bases is allowed, you need to worry about that, if it's not allowed then build a base put some doors down and you'll for sure have fun ^^"

I've played games made by 100s of people and have been no way near as good as this. Now I've put 72 hours into this game and counting so I thought I'd give this a reviewCons- Bases are way too easy to raid. I've made so many bases on server to see only a few hours later that they have been raided- The guns. The guns in Unturned are a bit too OP. If anyone has an Assault Rifle and you have a pistol you stand next to no chance to kill them- For me, nothing elsePros- Building: Personally I love the building. In single player (and online) I try to make the biggest base possible. Except from a few annoying things (Placement) There isn't too much wrong with building- Graphics: Whether at their lowest or highest, this game looks beautiful (Especially since it's made by a single person)- Survival: There's always (Until late into the game) a sense of survival. You have to look for food and water or you'll starve to death or die of dehydration. You have to either stay away from zombies or kill them fast enough or you will die/ infectOverallOverall I recommend this game and I feel that everyone needs to play this at some point. Now if you excuse me Imma get back to building bases and murdering zombiesWhat you waiting for? Get this game!"

,Recommended,304930,30225398,Posted: 27 February,all,DefiantBro,"So I've been playing this game since way back when PIE was the only real map in the game, and there really wasn't much too it. Recently I have seen other games try to immitate this game but honestly this is the best out there. It's fun to play solo, fun to randomly join random severs, fun to play with friends and it's fun to run your own server on (I haven't personally run my own server, but I have friends who have). Yeah there are the servers where you will find bad admins, but that's kind of the deal with games like these, shoot you can play DayZ mod or DayZ standalone and get bad admins, they're sort of like campers on Call of Duty, they're there but you can easily avoid them and not waste your time with them. Besides the bad admins the mod/workshop community is great and the game is pretty fun overall. I would recomend this game for new players and if you want to get really into it get the DLC/Gold for it."

,Recommended,304930,30222957,Posted: 27 February,all,DarkSamus9000,"Unturned starts you off in a brand new world all to yourself. You need to collect a few basic materials to get your feet on the ground in this world, and you start by looting and pillaging whatever remnant of human civilization you can find. Depending on your difficulty setting (I played normal), you can either sneak into the zombie-infested towns to grab your supplies, or you can run in kamikaze style, fist-fighting the zombies to obtain what you need.The zombie combat in Unturned was really fun for me when I started playing. Whether I had a shovel, a knife, a pistol, or a rocket launcher, it was always fun running into packs of the undead and slaughtering them to my heart's content. Nonetheless, I had a few issues with this game.One of the issues I had with this game was building. Building yourself a proper base is a long, soul-grinding process. If you play on a PVP server and want to reinforce it with metal, you're in for a far worse time.Another issue I had with the game was inventory management. Unlike games like Minecraft and Terraria, Unturned does not let you stack items. In fact, lots of items take up more than 1 inventory slot. A bottle of glue is small and consumes 1 slot, but a crate will consume an area of 4 slots (2x2) and most guns were 2x4. This made it difficult to manage the inventory and required a huge amount of storage crates if you wanted to keep what you found.The final issue I had was performance. I realize my laptop is old, and an AMD APU isn't exactly superb for gaming, but my framerate wasn't the problem. Turning visuals all the way down to low and resolution down to 720p, I usually maintained 20-25 FPS. The issue that annoyed the heck out of me was input lag. I've played games with worse framerates than these and seen no real input lag from my mouse or keyboard. Adding this on top of the poor inventory design made managing my storage (and my inventory) a huge pain.Once I had built a solid base and collected masses of weapons, ammo, and food, and once I had explored the map, the game became too repetitive. The only thing there was to do was hunt Mega Zombies or kill the normal guys in an acre's worth. There are a bunch of maps to play, so you can constantly get a fresh experience, but eventually you'll run out of maps. If you play a PvE world, don't expect it to last forever.But PvE is not the only way to play Unturned. I played in two different PvP worlds with my friends. The general experience of looting was fun, but the combat experience wasn't great for me. My framerate always dropped during combat, which made it difficult to play competitively. Plus, unless you set some rules for taking items from the enemy, you end up losing hours upon hours of grind time if you suffer defeat. Even if you do set restrictions on spoils of war, it seemed a bit unsatisfying to kill my friends and wait for them to come back and pick up their items. If I'm going to be shooting my friends online, I'll do it in a game designed for FPS, where death doesn't have such high consequences. I'd play a game like Unreal Tournament, if my computer could actually run it...All that said, even though the game got tiring for me after just a month or two of PvE gameplay with my friends, and PvP sucked for me, I still recommend trying it out. Assuming you can run it at 30 FPS or higher on your system, even with low video quality, you may find looting towns, airports, and military bases very fun and enjoy getting your feet on the ground by building a base to store your supplies and defend yourself from players, if you do PvP. The game is free, so your wallet doesn't have to hurt if you want to try playing!"

It makes it almost imposible to keep raiders out especiely since you can make armor out of wood you make it when ever you want and easaly get inside so that makes gamplay fun for the raider and not you that could have been 4 days worth the loot you just lost cause your screwed when they get inside, and alot of the time they break your bed so it does not feel fair that you can use wood which is EVERY WHERE to get in somones base so I dont recomend getting the game if you plan to play multiplayer on servers even on the PvE your not safe.

But if you look past that, you will find a free2play gem, that gives you more hours of survival-fun in a more pure fashion than some Big-Industry titles for big money will give you.The amount of content is amazing for a free game. It runs incredibly smooth and despite a couple hinks here and there, it barely has any gamebreaking bugs. New content is added all the time and there is no real downside on playing for free, instead of donating money, other than a couple skins you get extra.Unturned is one of the few free2play games, that actually should cost money. It's that good. Give it a try, it's free but worth a lot more than that."

Its a great survival game with lots to do! It never gets boring especially when playing on servers. Players in servers will always be out to kill you so it keeps you on your toes! Singleplayer mode is very good the zombies will always try to get you and its lots of fun when you're being chased by a massive hoard! The guns are all very different and fun to use. There is customizability for your character and the guns. In the end this game is so awesome.

And also it is way too easy to destroy someones stuff.

Mine used to be quite enough, but after a couple of updates adding some stuff, it started freezing and not responding, forcing me to force quit it, and lose everything I did that session if I was on singleplayer. However, considering only one genius guy in Canada is sitting there working on this game, this is a very much acceptable result. I expect this bug to be fixed with like a Unity update or something."

Also you should probably play single player first. The mods are fun, especially Hushwood. I'm quite new with only ten hours but considering what I've seen so far it is going to be very fun if I ever man up enough to kill zombies. Their groans cause me to panic. Also no one is very clear on how to spawn things in so here it is, @give revan/4 to get the eaglefire as a example. Use your own name and the 4 is the id number of the eaglefire. @vehicle revan/92 is a example of how to get a vehicle. Use your own name and the id of what you want. The @give/vehicle is required and its not caps sensitive. Just look up the a id number list and your set. Oh, and click surviver in the main menu to change appearance and skill set. I started as a cook but changed it to a Spec Ops. and got cooler clothing and skills. Enjoy and get a gun if you want to live past your first zombie encounter. :-)            Edit. Forgot to say the surviver option lets you change your name and don't forget to turn on cheats in a single player world. I spent two hours trying to get a gun only to realize I didn't turn on cheats. Use the ingame name that you give your character for cheats, not your steam name."

76561198086373496,Recommended,304930,29850955,Posted: 11 February,all,Screaming Cock,"Let me get this straight- unturned is not a zombie survival game anymore.  Anyone who has been playing for over an hour knows that surviving in this game is easier than being a pyro in tf2 or having an awp in cs go (very easy).  It has become a more of an open world pvp game with zombies to spice it up.  That is why KOS is all over the place, nothing else to do but kill people and take their juicy loot.  Some may hate this but me and my friends have learned to like it.  It turns the game into a massive tense, high staked pvp match.  I personally like this more than no KOS servers.   Trash talking 10 year olds serve as free loot to me since they are easy to kill.  I could care less about skins.  I see many people complain about how easy it is to raid bases.  A smart and thoughtful player can easily make a base designed to make raiding almost impossible.  One can use hidden rooms, hiding the base its self, and strategically placed sentries to hide loot boxes.  Great combat accept the honeybadger is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly op.The major problem with this game is not nelson, its the servers.  Around 90% of the servers if find are tpa, /kit, feasts, or some other plug in infested mess.  These plugins serve the people who don't are bad and prefer to have high grade loot just given to them.  This destroys the unique punch this game offers.  When you kill a looted military player in a vanilla server and take their stuff, you feel like a god with all the sick loot you got.  On these feast servers, military loot is so common that I would end up killing people so i can sell their inventory and get enough money to basically become an admin.  Bring back vanilla servers that show how great unturned can really be.  If you find a good vanilla server with a few friends who are good, prepare to have the time of your life.Some minor complaints: there is no reason why lmgs should be able to shoot through walls.  Charges are for that.  Lmgs should serve the role of destroying strong vehicles such as apcs and military aircraft.-Calling card too rare at the moment.- Horde beacon gives too much reward.-Drop shotting is op and annoying, a way to fix it is make the player very innaccurate for a short while after going prone.  -Third person gets rid of 90% of the recoil.-Fire zombies are just annoying.-Shot guns need a tone down in damage.-Hind gun should shoot explosive rounds (like shaddow stalker).-Minigun needs buff.-Honeybadger broken-buff suppressors-Fix the broken and misleading rarity system. (example: aug is epic and the aug scope is legendary...?)-Make bigger maps (even russia is small when you can fly accross it in a minute)-Ekho should be found in military locations as well as deadzones (russia)-Deadzones do not spawn enough loot (russia)-Claim flags shouldnt be able to morph inside walls-Make a hot bar at the bottom of hud-To keep new players playing, allow people to spawn with flashlight and a small amount of foot (like in 2.0)-Change the color of russia and pei military gear so it doesn't blend in with environment, this makes ghillie suit obsolete-turn spec ops beret into a helmet-tone down sniper damage to vehicles a bit (to keep the grizzly from being an anti aircraft gun)-toxicity shouldn't decrease when below 50%, this is just annoying-Have some dedicated servers for vanilla mapsAll of these are simple problems with simple fixes (accept for the last one).This may seem like a negative review, but if i made a list for the good things, it would be the length of the bible."

Eventually I got bored and decided to give it a go. Best decision I've made in a long time.Unturned is a great game. When in the ingame towns it can be panicky and dangerous. But traveling inbetween them, the game transforms into a peaceful adventure.I very much love this game, and though I haven't yet purchased the Gold Upgrade, I definitely plan to. If only to give the Dev  a bit more budget to continue improving this game.I definitely recommend this game."

When playing on a laptop with a trackpad and a usb mouse, if you touch the trackpad it will change the control to only the track pad. You wont be able to use the mouse unless you shut off the game completely and turn it back on. It's really annoying when your hand accidentally touches it in the middle of a fight and end up dying.

,Recommended,304930,29923166,Posted: 14 February,all,Panic! And MCR Treasure,"I did like the game, very much, but there is one thing that needs to be fixed, and I would only reccomend it if maybe it is changed slightly.First of all, it's great. The concept and the attention to detail is just incredible! The addition of the batteries in cars was really useful, and personally I enjoy it better this way. But there's just one small issue that's pushing me away from playing this game - the zombies.Now, the zombies themselves are perfectly fine, but I haven't played this game for a while and to be honest, a lot of making the game much harder. I was on easy mode, and before, I have never died using my techniques. In fact, for 2 hours yesterday, 3 resets, in every one I didn't die, so it's nothing to do with my skill. However, in the 1st try this morning, no new updates if I'm not mistaken, I needed to get a little bit closer to the zombies. But surpisingly, I did not.I couldn't see the zombies. There were no zombies within one game metre of me and I was checking all around me, crouching. Then, out of thin air, it seems, a zombie popped up and started hitting me. My natural instinct was to use my knife, so I clicked both ways and it wasn't working. There came a new zombie, and when I walked to the door, it wasn't there. There was no gap, where I came in was a wall.In the end, I died. With all the items that wouldn't have been lost if the game didn't completely glitch out. If this doesn't solve, I might not play the game again until it is, because I haven't got the time to wait around, getting everything I lost all over again.Apart from that, great game. I suggest ya'll play it =3"

76561198061208202,Recommended,304930,29953913,Posted: 15 February,all,Sweet Jamaican Yellow Yam,"This game is pretty much DayZ for little babies. The game focuses on you being a little naked person with minecraft graphics running around looting and scavenging. If you're playing single player, you really lose out on the much bigger and more interesting aspect: the online multiplayer. My computer is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2010 prehistoric laptop that functions better as an oversized paperweight than a computer and it still runs this game fine. The online is a lot of fun, and there are plenty of servers for any way you want to play. Do you want to play in a server with no pvp and everyone is banding together to create the ultimate base? Go ahead! Do you want a brutally difficult server where you struggle through a harsh snowy canadian environment and just barely scrap together enough supplies to not freeze and starve to death in a day? Go for it! Do you want a regular meat-and-potatoes pvp/pve clan/faction server? There's plenty of servers like that! I even tried some of the survival/last man standing game modes. Pretty fun. This game appeals to the people that want a survival zombie game but don't want to spend hours and hours scavenging to get a wimpy pistol. If you spend hours and hours on this game, you'll soon find yourself with a healthy collection of guns, tools, a decent base, and some food and water.Pros: game looks like a saturday morning cartoon/minecraft adventure game.Runs well on even the worst computerWide variety of weapons, vehicles, and townsSurvival is tons of fun when you get deep into itIt's free!In the middle:This game is casual. Take that however you want.Cons:The flying vehicles operate like a whale with an eating disorderPopular servers have clans that treat the game like real lifeadmin abuse is sadly pretty commonmaking a good base is very tediousActually taking the time to develop your character rather than just hoarding guns, ammo, and food is a pain"

With my almost 200 hours recorded playing this game, I have discovered quite a few things. A few updates ago, they had introduced so many new items that really added some new characteristics into the game. One such thing was the addition of tanks. A vehicle that could shoot had never been introduced before into Unturned, and it has proven to be a hit among players like me. The workshop content is absolutely endless, with mods ranging from the little things to some gamechangers. The multiplayer system in Unturned is really something else, with private and public servers alike. The texturing could be a bit better in the game, but I can understand that they want as many people as possible to be able to enjoy the unique experience Unturned brings to the Free-to-play section on Steam. To sum it up, Unturned has great gameplay, intriguing additions every so often, and a one of a kind experience that I am glad I can enjoy just as much as anyone else can."

Sonic celebrates his 15th anniversary by blazing his way onto the next-generation consoles, with his first adventure set in the human world. Featuring interactive 3D environments and a large cast of returning and new characters, get ready for the reinvention of Sonic The Hedgehog, in his most intense, high velocity escapade to date. [Sega]. Amazing game. Could never say Sonic is a bad game but one thing that really ticks me off is the loading. Worst of all, if you do a challenge. It will load, then the person will give you a one liner on what you have to do, then it will load again! It's even worse if you fail the mission because you've go to go through it all over again. Another thing is the silly mini-games. Sonic has to save the world BUT before he does, he has the option of solving a silly puzzle? The Stages are amazing though. Beautiful graphics.You simply can't ask for more out of an action game. Mission accomplished. Sonic is born anew. [Dec 2006; Score revised in Jan issue due to long load times.]"

The Standalone has its ups and downs but is a solid standalone in of itself offering quests, safezones, gear and PVP and PVE which is very challenging. I popped over 2 hours into the game and felt I got my time just right before I felt I had gotten my doze of Zombie survival horror. The game had very little bugs for being early access and the DAyZ developers has fixed the glaring FPS issues, but it came to a cost of the graphics quality. I hope to see their new game Infefstation surivor stories can pay off."

,Recommended,304930,30150552,Posted: 24 February,all,Tongy,"English -Overall, I find this is a fantasticly made game. Very entertaining, good developer. The graphics aren't great, but thats the artstyle for the game. Probably the best thing about Unturned I would say is the updates, the developer (Nelson Sexton) frequently updates the game once a week. Sometimes adding other things to the game or some bug fixes, which both are very usefull. There is a singleplayer mode, a tutorial mode and a multiplayer mode. Singleplayer does not require internet, nor does tutorial. However multiplayer does. The multiplayer has a voice chat and a text chat. To use the voice chat feature, by default to use the voice key is LEFT-ALT but can later on be changed in the settings. There are hundreds of servers to choose from such as Roleplay servers were you can choose a role such as a hitman and complete jobs for people while be chased by the police. Or there is PvP servers where you can just find items and kills other people. Some PvP servers may have economy on them so there will most likely be type of currency which you can then spend in a virtual shop to purchase weapons and other goods, some servers may have an element on pay to win, some may not. There is also PVE which only has a PvP aspect towards zombies, not players. So its quite a calm way to play the game if you feel like it. If you found this review useful. Please give this a useful vote!Chinese -一般来说，我发现这是一个梦幻般的游戏。非常有趣，好的开发人员。图形不是很好，但这是游戏的艺术风格。可能是Unturned最好的东西，我会说是更新，开发人员（Nelson Sexton）经常每周更新一次。有时候添加一些东西到游戏或一些错误修复，这两个都是非常有用的。有单模式，教程模式和多人模式。单人游戏不需要互联网，教程不需要。但是很多人。许多人都有语音聊天和文字聊天。要使用语音聊天功能，默认情况下语音键为LEFT-ALT，但可以稍后在设置中更改。有数以百计的服务器可供选择，如角色扮演服务器，你可以选择一个角色，如杀手，并完成一个工作，为警察搜捕的人。或者有一个PvP服务器，你只能找到项目和杀了别人。一些PvP服务器可能是经济的，所以它很可能是一种货币，然后你可以花钱在虚拟商店购买武器和其他物品，一些服务器可能有一个因素支付，有些可能不。有PVE，它只有一个PVP侧的僵尸，而不是玩家。所以这是相当平静的方式来玩游戏，如果你喜欢它。如果你觉得这个评论是有用的。请给这个有用的投票！Spanish -En general, creo que este es un juego fantástico. Muy interesantes, desarrolladores con talento. Los gráficos no son muy buenos, pero este es el estilo de juego. Puede que no quiero decir que lo mejor es poner al día, actualizada semanalmente desarrollador (Nelson Sexton). A veces, añadir algo, o algunas correcciones de errores en el juego, que es muy útil. De modo único, el modo Tutorial y el modo multijugador. Independiente del juego no necesita Internet, no tutoriales. Sin embargo, hay una gran cantidad de personas. Muchas personas tienen voz y chat de texto. Para utilizar la función de chat de voz, de forma predeterminada, la tecla de voz se deja Alt, pero se puede cambiar después de la configuración. Hay cientos de servidores desde el servidor, tales como papeles, se puede elegir un papel, tales como la elección del asesino, y el rendimiento de las personas que trabajan en la detención policial. O un servidor PVP, sólo se puede buscar objetos y matar a otros. Algunos servidores PvP puede ser la economía, lo que es probable que sea una moneda, entonces usted puede comprar armas y otros bienes de consumo en la tienda, un factor que algunos servidores pueden tener que pagar, mientras que otros no. Hay PVE, PVP es sólo un lado de los zombies, pero no el jugador. Así que esta es la manera de jugar el juego y tranquilo, si lo desea. Si encuentra útil este comentario Por favor, dar a este voto útil!French -Dans l'ensemble, je pense que cela est un jeu fantastique. Très intéressant, les développeurs talentueux. Les graphismes ne sont pas très bons, mais cela est le style de jeu. Il ne peut pas dire qu'il est préférable de mettre à jour, développeur hebdomadaire mis à jour (Nelson Sexton). Parfois, ajouter quelque chose ou quelques corrections de bugs dans le jeu, ce qui est très utile. Single-mode, le mode Tutorial et le mode multijoueur. jeu indépendant n'a pas besoin d'Internet, pas des tutoriels. Cependant, il y a beaucoup de gens. Beaucoup de gens ont la voix et le chat texte. Pour utiliser la fonction de chat vocal, par défaut, la voix Alt gauche du clavier, mais peut être changé après la configuration. Il y a des centaines de serveurs à partir du serveur, tels que papiers, vous pouvez choisir un rôle, comme le choix de l'assassin, et la performance des personnes qui travaillent dans la garde à vue.

The biggest danger in this game are the other players.This game has a pretty well fleshed out story, with scraps of paper detailing different events around the apocalypse, some cool NPC quests on the russia map along with some secrets.The graphics speak for themselves, voxel/robluox style, it runs fairly decent on any computer built in the year 2010+.Also this game gets weekly updates consistently barely missing a week for over a year now, which is better than many AAA game companies; hi-rez, ubisoft, EA to name a few that do not update their games as often as Unturned."

It is my favorite PC-only game, and I joined up back in 2014 when it first came out. granted, I took an almost year-long break last year.What attracted me in the first place was the fact thatNelson updates this game every. god damn. week.That is serious dedication to a project he no doubt loves, and it shows in the amount of content in this game. I had great fun in singleplayer exploring PEI and Yukon, and I've just now started getting into multiplayer, which personally I only find fun with a friend while we talk with mics.Mulitplayeris fun once you've fund yourself some good supplies from a big ciy, and once you've started building your base. I especially enjoy mowing down a group of players to the sound of screeching. Except when it happens to me. You WILL die in multiplayer. A LOT. but as long as you're careful around the cities you'll soon be in the possesion of some armour and guns.Singleplayeron the other hand, is remarkably easier. in the frist hour I managed to fill my entire inventory with food above 50%, and some good pistols. Now I just need to find a spot to build my base."

,Recommended,304930,29470473,Posted: 24 January,all,Spark6149,"I find this game VERY addicting.  If you like survival, PvP, fun, guns, PvE, battles, last man standing , zombies, or scavenging.  All you need are trees to survive.  No going scavenging and all of that.  Make a campfire and bow.  Hunt deer.  Get clothes.  Cook the meat and eat it.  Pvp has amazing aspects as well.  Third person, PvP servers, options to disable crosshairs and hitmarkers, and an AMAZING range of weapons to use.  Fun doesn't have to be explained... PvE is a server option where people don't fight each other and team up to kill zombies.  I find it pointless since killing zombies is easy, but for those of you who enjoy it this would be the right game for you.  Battles are common on servers with 12+ people.  Encountering people can be deadly so skill is key on pvp servers.  You can use certain strategies such as flanking or coming in on both sides.  Meeting friends is another thing that is very easy and comes in handy with battles.  Personally I prefer Lyhme servers.  I have many team mates that follow me.  ALL of them I have met on Unturned servers.  Together we overpower most people on the server and encounter other teams every 10 minutes!  As you can tell PvP is my favorite aspect of this game.  Arena mode is another option for this amazing game.  Hop on an arena server with friends or your solo self and battle others to the death to become the last man alive.  Don't worry, there is a safezone that you go to if you die.  It's great but I would highly recommend spectating  mode  (Ahhem Nelson...).  Zombies are the main aspect of the game as you can tell by the icon.  They are VERY easy to kill when you get used to this game and their purpose is to be killed for exp or guard loot spawns.  Scavenging is the last aspect I have mentioned.  Finding good items and keeping or selling them on RP servers is a great way to play as in my first 200 hours of unturned 2.0 I traded with people.  Overall Unturned is a great game.  If you don't belive me then why have I played 2000+ hours?"

Make a friend with someone in a different timezome and you have got yourself set!-Map making is a great thing to do and is practically the only thing I do on Unturned, controls work great and object placement makes sence, however it lacks certain features but they are being added.Overall this game looks beautiful in it's own way, provides excellent gameplay that will last you hours upon hours,there is an easy map-making tool and a brilliant community.I personally believe that you should get this game, if you would like to support development make sure to buy the gold upgrade.9/10"

A big scare I have thought of is, when Unturned is done, and every update has came out, will it become a forgoten game, I know Nelson can't work on this forever, but I hope I can enjoy this amazing game while it is worth it. In conclusion, Unturned is a 9/10, for the amazing experience I have had with it, I love the challenge, I love it's realistic features, even if this game one day becomes the past, I will always remember it!"

In any case, This game is like, how can I put this... it's a zombie game for people who can't handle true zombie horror. If you like Minecraft, this is for you. If you can't run Dead Rising, Resident Evil, Left4Dead 2 or DayZ, this ame is for you. If you're a big baby that can't handle exploding heads, maggots and worms and zombie amputations via shotgun then this game is for you.I don't play this game because I want to kill zombies. I don't even play this game because I like survival crafting. (I don't.)I play it because no one really buys Capcom's zombie games, and my friends haven't touched L4D2 in years. And they have no excuse, L4D2 was free on steam one weekend. So saying Unturned is cheaper is B.S.It's hard to tell which guns are what, because they all have nondescribing names like Sabertooth and Maplestrike. the gun shapes could use real texturing to tell the guns apart.Nevertheless, player interaction is best on small servers with friends. Bonus points if a few friends decide to go rogue to keep things interesting.I would love for this game to get better. I would like to be able to play with friends. But everyone has different ideas on what they want to play and it's hard getting a group together."

If you don't have enough money to buy a game like this or your computer can't run it use this instead. I do not love this game but playing can be enjoyable. 6/10

,Recommended,304930,29880720,Posted: 12 February,all,Fuzz (wildcase.com),"Unturned. The famous game that just came out of early access and is still growing. I love this game. I always delete it and then wonder why i did in the first place. Untuned started out as a ROBLOX game called Deadzone. As of now, Deadzone onroblox.comhas been shut down by Nelson Sexon. The game is not pay to win, It does have cosmetic items that have no impact on gameplay though. As an early access player, I personally believe that i will never find a better free to play game anywhere. I love this game more than games you have to buy. The possibilities are endless. You can play on servers, or play single player and remain unturned."

He is a good person and he releases an update for the game every Friday. EVERY. FRIDAY. Can you believe that? The game is absolutely amazing too! The community is growing every single day and it won't stop any time soon. There's workshop for this game too, if you want to have so mods then subscribe to them and have EVEN more fun than you had before! The game is just, just so perfect. Sure, there are a few bugs but they get fixed. Nelson listens to his community and that's why I really like him.One of the best games ever in my opinion.All for free."
