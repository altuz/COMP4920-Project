It just didn't have much going for it besides the punching bears bit. The game isn't that long, a single playthrough can be done in one sitting. This isn't surprising as the game was originally a mobile (and Ouya) game. It's a very simplified version of a game like Streets of Rage with regenerating health and no pick-up items. You level up as you play and unlock stat points to powerup your Health, Power, Speed and Special. The Arena mode looks to be a survival mode where you get to play as any character in the game that you've faced off against and other special characters. It doesn't add much enjoyment to the game sadly. Overall the game is horribly repetitive and offers little to no ""replayability.""You also fight velociraptors and deer alongside bears. I like the final choice, didn't see it coming.I'd recommend this game as a casual beat-em-up to play when you want a quick game. Although at full price it's not worth it really, but if you can get it at a discount it's a decent buy.For the regular price of $7.99 or even the current sale price of $6.79 it isn't that good of a deal.You can find the game cheaper on mobile platforms: $3.99 on iTunes and the Play Store and $1.99 on the android Amazon Store"

The game hides behind a vale of so unique retro design and SO HILARIOUS AND FRESH jokes about bears trying to conceal gameplay that is downright terrible. Comparing this to Streets of Rage is an injustice. Unless you find EXTREMLY repetitive gameplay fun dont get this game."

At first glance the game is pretty well built ( By this I mean it runs with absolutely no problems and have not experienced any lag issues at all ). I also was entertained by the game play for about 5-10 minutes and then grew bored of the combat system. The game seems kind of empty to me as there are very few enemy variations ( even different color pallettes could help with this ). The shortness of the game is not an issue to me because a beat-em-up shouldnt take longer than 1:30 to complete from start to finish. All in all I really wouldn't recommend buying this game even for $4 unless some improvements were made to the game.Possible things to improve (Each of these things should be done if possible)- More than one playable character for story mode (Unlocks after completing easy mode first)-Change the health regeneration system so theres actual health pick-ups (This helps to make the game feel less empty)-Breakable items that may or may not contain weapons and health pick-ups-Enemy Variation-Movesets of playable charactersThe moveset of Tim Burr is pretty basic which caused me to become bored of the gameplay pretty quickly. If I had more than a few ways to deal with single and multiple enemies I wouldnt mind the amount of repetition you get in this game.Lastly, comparing this game to streets of rage is truthfully an injustice..."

The action is swift, yet raw, and the gameplay is just about as simple as it could ever get. Everything works well here and is more memorable than you would expect given the graphical presentation. The story may or may not stick with you, but it will certainly stick with me. I thought I saw futuristic human fish walking on two legs yowhza!"
,Not Recommended,305070,12431059,"Posted: 9 October, 2014",all,Motherfucking Jojo Reference,"This game made me physically mad.It looked cool. It looked like a fun arcade fighter. But in reality its nothing but a pack of lies.Let's start with the enemies first.The devs found it a great idea to create only two real enemy types: Bears, which are the level's boss enemies, and, also bears? I can't  tell if the second enemy type are bears since the bosses are clearly defined as bears but the common enemy looks more akin to a human-bear-squirrel freak of nature. And while there are several variations of this Humabearrel each one does the EXACT. SAME. GODDAMN. THING. It feels as though I'm playing the same level over, and over, and over again. It goes like this: fight squirbearmen, fight actual bear, go to next level. The silly gimmicks of traveling through time don't change the enemies at all except for amount of health, which, while im on that little part, IS ♥♥♥♥ING RIDICULOUS. You start off with the ""bear""(don't get me started on how much they used this goddamn pun) minimum of damage that youre able to cause and each enemy has health into the hundreds. Endlessly doing single digit damage on an enemy that you know will take forever to defeat is tedious as all hell and gets boring after all of ten seconds. And the enemies never end either. You all must know about how in a normal arcade beat 'em up how you fight maybe one or two enemies already waiting for you and then three or so more jump out and attack, correct? Well in this game I constantly found myself against hordes of freaky squirrelbear ♥♥♥♥♥, wondering when, oh when, will I be able to move on? Combine that with their massive healthbars ad you see why it took me 2.2 hours to finish what should have been a mayyyyyybe 45 minute game. ♥♥♥♥ing A, did i hate those endless, boring, tedious parts. Not to mention the bears send you flying on every hit and the manbearpig♥♥♥♥ers stand over your napping body to wail on you every time you get up. And by wail, I MEAN WAIL. Every hit from them stops you from moving and if you're trapped between them well gg no re to you cause you're ♥♥♥♥ed.And now they storyline. This has spoilers, so if you plan on buying this game (protip: ♥♥♥♥ing don't its horrible) avoid thisarea.So the story is youre Tim Mc♥♥♥♥face, some random♥♥♥♥♥lumberjack guy (had to interpret this from his clothing) who ALL OF A SUDDEN gains a talking fist named, you certainly guessed it, Fist of Awesome. This fist's entire purpose is that it guides you in your quest, and even that wasn't explained all too well. In reality all it really does is help make ♥♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jokes and un-BEAR-able puns. Tim here and his mighty jerk-it hand suddenly arrive in an alternate reality where bears rule. So what's the first reasonable action you ask?They punch deers.I don't know about you but this is flawless. 10/10. roll end credits.But seriously, ♥♥♥♥♥♥s bad man.So anyway you realize bears are the true enemy and go on a long♥♥♥♥♥adventure where you learn that somehow the bears have a time transport train that brings them back in time to breed with past bears and create new super bears and repeat. I could not be making this up. That is how it goes.So you beat the time machine to explosive death and save your world, right?Of course not it's never that easy, because the bears have fixed the machine and made everything worse. Bow Bear-ba Fetts fight you as you make youre way to Bear-hatten and into a strip club called ""Bare Bears"" where you find OH HEY ITS FOA'S BROTHER WHO AS IT TURNS OUT STARTED ALL OF THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥AND KILLED HIS BROTHER WHO IS NOW YOUR HAND MAKES SENSE AMIRITE GUIYS????????????So this ♥♥♥♥er then transforms into a massive bear thing and you kick the crap out of him and you win. Fist of Awesome somehow stops possessing your hand and it turns out its now your wedding day. You then talk to some people and accidently walk into a guy who calls you lover and gives you a big sloppy kiss cause it turns out thats the gay ending. Literally.All in all, 0/10 worst game ever.Much bad.Do not buy for any amount of money.Don't even buy it for free.It's that level of complete♥♥♥♥♥♥0/10 game that runs on the 0/10 engine with 0/10 graphics 0/10 storyline and a 0/10 soul.♥♥♥♥THISGAME"
76561197990726050,Not Recommended,305070,11564493,"Posted: 5 August, 2014",all,EgoTheLivingPlanet,"It's not the worst game I've played, but I've definitely played better. I appreciate the blending of Atari-ish graphics with some newer style effects. However, I think retro graphics are more the rule than the exception at this point and they don't necessarily fit the style of game. The same goes for the jokes; They're something I like, especially the puns, but the ""fighting bears = manliness"" line of joking is just beating a dead horse (or bear) nowadays. The mechanics are simple and functional, this isn't bad. What I don't like about the mechanics is the lack of combos and special moves. I'm willing to give that a pass given that this is a port of a mobile game.In summary, I don't recommend the game at it's current retail price of $7.99. If you end up with a coupon like I did, you genuinely enjoy the beat-em up genre and you want a fun little diversion get it."
76561198091807842,Recommended,305070,11956048,"Posted: 2 September, 2014",all,SexySlota,"So here's my short review. Can you punch bears in this game? Yes, a lot.And here's a longer one. The reason I got the game in the first place is that I had a discount for it. And to be honest probably wouldn't have bought it if I didn't, however it won me over with its promise of flannel shirts, manly beards and a peculiar self-aware sense of humor. And that it delivered. The game has character. It has an appealing visual design, a great soudtrack to keep you motivated during the bear punching and a story probably written by H.G.Wells himself (probably not true).Now the 'punching' itself is not one of the game's strongest atributes. The problem lies in the lack of variety in combat, especially in the boss battles. You end up finding a single strategy that works for you and then using it for the entire game. That is partially mended by the Arena game mode, which has tons of challanges that force you to change and improve your play style.Final vedict. I am probably in the minority here, by saying it's good. Not great, but good. True, the story mode is not all that challanging and is a bit too short, however if you ever wanted to punch a bear in the mouth, have € 6 to spend and a free afternoon, i say give this one a shot."

Would not buy at full price though the now reduced cost maybe worth your time if you found Final Fight or Streets of Rage too long or hard."

I laughed and tapped my foot through every level, and immediately started my second play through on a higher difficulty after finishing the game. This game has the perfect blend of great art and music style, humor and fluid game play, and one of the best credit theme songs of all time. Fist Of Awesome is priced perfectly and left me with a smile on my face and nostalgia in my heart. This is a great indie title and has earned 7.5 out of 10 from me.STORYThe story of Fist Of Awesome is a timeless tale about a lumberjack called Tim Burr, who must fight his way to the truth, and set right the timeline that has seen his home destroyed and his family taken from him. Tim is empowered with the mighty Fist Of Awesome, a talking hand that guides his travels through the damaged timelines searching for the cause of the temporal disturbance. Along his journey Tim must face off against super advanced bears, deer and buffalo who due to the timeline alterations have risen to be the dominant power on Earth.Fist Of Awesome's story is silly, but that is what I fight Bears was aiming for, and each funny one liner, pop culture reference or throw back to old school gaming is so perfectly delivered that the player will have a great time and laugh right through to the end. The fist play through of the story will take the average gamer no more than an hour to complete but with this in mind I was not disappointed by the playtime, and instead finished the game feeling that I had a great bit of fun getting there.GAMEPLAYFist Of Awesome's controls will be instantly familiar to anyone who has spent some time playing side scrolling fighting games and are easy to get the hang of. The combat is basic in concept but as enemies become more resilient in the higher levels a degree of strategy is required to progress. Each time zone Tim progresses through culminates in a boss fight which is started off with some funny dialogue and are a decent challenge to the player.Tim gains points and levels up throughout the stages depending on the combos the player can land, and is able to allocate one point to life, strength, speed or special per level. I had a great time with the general game play and leveling system, with the only let down being that enemy types were a bit too samey, and didn’t use their type specific attacks often enough.VISUALS & MUSICThe 8-bit art and music style of Fist Of Awesome is brilliant, and further enhances the comedy of the game. I found each level to be entertaining and beautiful in its own way, and enjoyed the well paced soundtrack throughout this crazy adventure.For my full review and heaps of other delicious content seeGlitch"

,Recommended,305070,21606856,"Posted: 3 March, 2016",all,AyyySB,"Didn't need to play this for very long in order to get a good idea on what the game is like.It's a brawler, but not a very good one. There is no blocking, no dodging, no strategy other than where your clunky-controlled player is on the screen and where to attack. Otherwise it is spamming buttons. All of the enemies act in the same way and there is no variety other than the occasional enemy having a new attack (Which is always easy to avoid), and the backgrounds. Even the bosses which I have fought so far have been exactly the same to each other, just with more health. I wouldn't mind but the boss fights act the same as the enemy.I'm sorry, am I missing something? Because what I found here was a pretty bland and basic fighting game. It isn't long either.BUTI still reccomend it. BECAUSE I bought it cheap and it is still cheap as of today even when not on sale. But if you can get it on mobile, you will probably be better there. I feel this would be more fun as a little distraction on a long journey to place on your phone and/or tablet.+Somewhat compelling story+Doesn't take itself too seriously which works with the tone of the game-Basic combat with no strategy-Very short-Upgrades have simingly no effect"

What you should know going in though is you should be getting it for about 70% story and 30% actual gameplay. Yes it's a side-scrolling beat-em-up, and yes we desperately need more good games along those lines. Fist of Awesome doesn't quite live up in my opinion.Well why the hell am I recommending it? Because for the price to entertainment value the game is totally worth it. It's funny, and it has a challenge mode that's actually kinda challenging. In general the fighting is pretty clunky, and it's not terribly hard to abuse the setup to win pretty much any fight if you're patient about it. Enemies will all fall for the same dumb tricks. If you're like me and as impatient as all get-out, then the game's challenge goes up a bit and it feels a little more rewarding to clear a stage. The graphics are that retro-throwback nostalgia-style that's so dominant in indie titles these days, but it's done well, and the writing is at the right level where sitting down with a beer, hooking up the gamepad, and playing through can make for a pleasant couple of hours.The biggest drawbacks are the few I've mentioned: clunky fighting and not really challenging. The other big drawback is a lack of multiplayer. Even if it was just local co-op, I'd be happy. Side-scrollers are the kind of thing you want to get together with friends to grind your way through, laugh, and chew the fat over. While I can enjoy this kind of game on my own, I like the option of having a friend or two along for the ride. Comedies are always funnier when there's someone else in the room to laugh with."

Is that bear really in the game, or real life? What is the exact scenario that would happen if I was to fight a bear under incredibly realistic circumstances? Fist of Awesome has answered, and this is the best bear fighting simulator I have seen all year.And the story is incredibly deep, too. Never have I ever cried, or been so touched by the Tim Burr's struggle for humanity, and the fights he faces with his own demons, with whom he must also fight alongside. The supporting characters play an astounding plot-central role that no other written genius could ever deliver, on paper, movie, or game.

I have to constantly pause and stretch my hands because I keep spamming the attack button. The bottom line is this is a Great game I would strongly reccomend it for the unbeatable price."

The humor is kinda funny I guess, but it seemed like it was trying a little too hard. If this game was free then I would reccomend it but don't waste your four bucks"

It's the exact same mechanics again and again followed by an identical boss.  The only difference is that the ""models"" and level's look change, but the gameplay never changes.  And those sound effects...argh.  I expected so much more and was sorely disappointed."

Gets kind of repetitive towards the middle, but if you stick it out, it is worth the money. So many laughs."
