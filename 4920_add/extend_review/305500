There has not been any recent updates nor has the developer spoke on the forums for months.  I would say buyer beware on this one as I am not sure if it will ever be updated again and the forums are pretty dead.I will say to be fair that up until I hit the bug it was an okay hack and slash ARPG.  That said, I don't think even without the bug that it is worth the $20 asking price."

Decent Art direction.Cons:   Lame AI Pathfinding.    Weak unresponsive controls.    NPCs will regularly glitch out, stand totally still & make quests impossible to finish.    Exiting & restarting the game doesn't always fix that problem.    Bad level design.    The Mini map is worthless.      You'll wander around lost while an Infection clock ticks down.    The Escort missions are a nightmare.All in all, I love Diablo & I'm not yet sick of Zombies.     However, shoddy game design prevents this game from reaching its potential."

The muliplayer mode is DOWN. For some reasons you cannot reach a single host, nor host by yourself.Devs doesn't respond to fix this issue, apparently because they abandoned this title inofficially but like to suck money from this half-broken remainings.We were eager to see a lively adventure and were deeply disappointed as we figured out, that for some time MP seems to be broken...Ordered a refund, which can be tricky when you bought the 4pack version, because every single player you gifted has to refund on his own.So... you've been warned.At least Valve did add a refund option over the past years...After hosting sinister dev's games has grown in numbers this is just  necessary."

If you like diablo, torchlight, van helsing, etc... you should like this game, as the actual gameplay is similar to those games. The story revolves around zombies! Tons of loot, can equip different armors and weapons which changes your appearance, level progression is more old school, (you not only have a skill tree but also level up stats), multiple characters to play as, multiple difficulties, and, although nothing mind blowing, a cool story.I applaud the devs for including gamepad support in an iso arpg, which used to be rare for these games to have on pc, so thank you for helping make a m/k arpg a thing of the past.I also really dig the voice acting, it is very good for a budget title. The graphics are what I expected from a game I paid less than $20 for.If you like iso arpgs you cannot go wrong with Trapped Dead: Lockdown. I highly recommend people that like the genre to buy this game...NOW! Its a steal at its current price. Just don't go in thinking a budget title is going to be diablo 4."

A DIABLO, VAN HELSING style hack and slash action rpg in a modern setting with grim ambience of BLOOD and the first POSTAL where death is everywhere.You can choose between several characters who each are really well voice acted. You will be able to level up attributes and skills personalizing your character by putting level up points in these areas. Characters are varied with some being able to use guns while others like the Priest relying on melee and spiritual powers to destroy flesh feasting fiends unleashed upon the world.Music sets the tone perfectly with its dark all enveloping quality as if the world had been transformed into a unending morgue of sorrow and sanity destroying horror.Graphics are gorey and surreal in their unescapable nightmare visuals. Environments look very nice with a comfortable amount of interaction. Your characters are displayed well though you cant zoom in and out. There is a great rag doll inventory system where you can equip weapons and armor which will change the physical appearance of your character ingame.Gameplay has just the right amount of balanced movement and weapons fire where actions take the proper amount of time to do without being too fast or too slow unlike the first game in the series where the combat and movement felt very frustrating and clumsy. Your character can heal up by consuming food and things like holy water. There are also edible items which will give you temporary boost benefits to your skills.TRAPPED DEAD: LOCKDOWN buy it! Play it! Save your eternal soul before its toooo lateeeee!"
76561197971724802,Recommended,305500,31987668,Posted: 26 May,all,Pontifex Maximus,"Trapped Dead: Lockdownis an homage to the horror movies of the ’80s with players controlling their characters in a 3rd person isometric view.  Each character has a different storyline so picking a new character to play with will give you a new story and new objectives to completing their path.  In addition, each character has their own individual strengths and abilities so you will have to use those particular attributes to their fullest in order to capitalize on what each character is best at.  The skill trees for each character is individualized giving you access to new unique defensive abilities and attack moves as you progress through the story.  The action is fast-paced and tactile so if you are not familiar with your characters abilities, getting swarmed by zombies is inevitable.Machetes, knives, pistols, axes, tasers, bows, shotguns, rifles, grenades, magic crosses and vehicles.  These are just a few of the literally hundreds of different weapons that are at your disposal for dispatching the walking dead. You have the choice of wielding either two different weapons or one very powerful two-handed weapon.The sound effects and soundtrack in the game are very well done.  The moaning of the zombies, the crackle of rifle report and the hacking of zombie flesh are all high quality sound effects and help to present a town that has gone to hell in a hand-basket with most of its population being turned into the undead.Trapped Dead: Lockdownisn’t the worst hack and slash game I have ever played, but it definitely isn’t the best one either. Get it on sale (I got it for €2.00)THE GOOD- Good ambiance and setting- Isometric design is satisfying- Voice acting fits the B-movie vibe of the gameTHE BAD- Level design is wonky at best- Attacks and movement being the same button makes for frustrating combat- Visuals are a bit dated7/10DISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE |OKAY| GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE"

I collect games and usually just take them out for a quick test drive with the intention of getting back to them if one appears to have potential. Of the three games I bought today Trapped Dead: Lockdown was the one I held out the least amount of hope for. Much to my surprise this little game was a blast and I was blown away by it enough to go back in my libraray and break out the original Trapped Dead and start it up  to. Trust me this will be $9.99 that is well spent.

There's lots of unfair and unbalanced parts, but they give you a checkpoint right before so it's not that bad.The keyboard + mouse controls are really bad though, you use the number keys to drink health potions and do 1 of 2 special moves, and your mouse is used to move places and attack. Which made combat really awkward."
,Recommended,305500,15824624,"Posted: 14 May, 2015",all,Nanobang,"[Revised 11 June 2015]Trapped Dead: Lockdown is a rock-solid, kill-the-zombies game that doesn't take itself too seriously.  The dialogue, scenery, and characters are all cartoonish without being cartoony.  The combat is fun, franetic, and delightfully gory, yet  requires some tactical considerations, not simple button mashing. I can't tell you if you'll like it, but I can tell you that the very first time I played it, i played it for 3 hours straight.Some reviewers have said they don't like the art, but i think the simple style of the art lends a brutish and savage aesthetic and works here.  It's not bad art. It's merely a simplified style and, I believe, it adds to the game's tone and vision.Today Trapped Dead lock-down patched the broken controller issue.  They have thus responded to complaints, owned their mistake, and repaired it.  For that reason I have changed my recommendation to the thumbs up I would originally have awarded the game.I remain concerned about the unresponsiveness of the developer, a concern that originally garnered a thumbs down review from me.  True they have just today patched the problem with the controller, but the parties involved remain mute here at Steam.  They haven't even announced the game has been patched or what the patch repaired.  If I hadn't actually seen the game being updated when I signed in today, I would have gone one believing the game was broken.  As it stands it's anybody's guess whether other issues complained about in the forums have been fixed at all.In my original review I wrote that ""The silence displayed by the development group and the publisher hint at best a disregard for the player's experience.""   It's since occured to me that they may simply be inept or inexpert at communitcating with their customers and would-be customers.  Whatever the reason, silence is a poor practice in a community as vocal as Steam's.If you have problems, after complaining on the forums, then let me recommend you do as I did and contact their support team directly.  Like me you may get an e-mail saying that the developers have been informed.  Hopefully, unlike me, you'll get a confirmation once the fix is in place too."

,Recommended,305500,20034338,"Posted: 28 December, 2015",all,superjamie,"Whilst the original Trapped Dead was a huge disappointment, this (sequel? remake? reimagining?) is made by a different studio. Thoughts of the original game colored my impression of this for quite a while, however about 8 levels in I realised I was really enjoying myself and found it hard to put down. Sure it's got some flaws: the movie compression is ugly, the voice acting is terrible (and I hardly ever think that even when everyone else goes), the storyline is incomplete and meandering and references events and details which were never previously discussed, NPCs are completely unrealistic, but you don't come to this game for the story. The action is fun and that's what counts. Gameplay wise, I don't think I'd play this multiple times to unlock all the achievements with multiple classes, and there's probably too much inventory juggling, but apart from that it's a good blast. Don't expect some wonderful polished experience like Shadowgrounds, this is not that good, but it's not garbage like the first Trapped Dead either. Pick this up on sale and it's a good buy."

And uninspired developers maybe."
