,Not Recommended,305510,23122398,"Posted: 21 May, 2016",all,Reliant39,"Developers disappeared from the face of the Earth for six months, only to reappear and announce that Stardock will no longer be publishing the game and they're thinking about what to do next. They even asked players for advice on what to do! This doesn't instil much confidence. I applied for a refund, but no luck (have had the game for more than two weeks).In any case, my advice is not to buy this game until it has been properly released and you've had the chance to read some reviews about the game. Right now, it doesn't seem like there's going to be much progress and there's no telling at this point what the game will eventually look like. Avoid.Update 3 June 2016: a new patch is incoming. Notice: incoming. It's not released, but in development. And what are they focusing on? Some balance changes, making things faster, and squashing a few bugs. The bottom line: they did nothing with Servo for more than half a year and now they've basically restarted development with this new patch that will change the game in small ways only. Too little, too late: continue to avoid this for now.Update 23 September 2016: some minor bug fixes in the months since the developers deemed fit to post an update and more promises that further patches and fixes (and so on) are coming ""soon"". Don't buy this game unless it actually leaves Early Access. And will it ever leave Early Access? I have my doubts, and even if it does, the chances of it actually being good are slim to nonexistent. The game is simply not on the developer's list of priorities.Update 5 October 2016: the developers have posted in the forum, rather laconically, that development will cease. Apparently, BonusXP thinks it's absolutely fine to screw people over by asking them for money and then not delivering a functional product. From forum posts I gather that the servers are also offline and you can no longer use the game as it is. A waste of money and time. Steam didn't give me a refund, since I've ""owned"" the game for too long now.Bottom line: don't throw money at the game and avoid this developer like the plague."

There's no wait period, no breathing room, no chance for you to think for a moment about your next step.It's ""hurry and teleport in"" before someone steals your rez node and then you gotta turn around 'cause you already have baddies gunning at your dropship.If you somehow survived the first wave AND managed to snag at least one node, then you have very little time to build up your strength before the meteorites show.They show every 800 resources. Global. Meaning that if you didn't get one of the first two nodes, you're screwed with only your servo and the starter turret.If you manage to get a roving force and destroy one of the two meteors (they drop them in pairs, I think), then another one will take its place.I can't recall of any other strategy game that does this. Dawn of War, Starcraft, Age of Empires... Even the freaking MOBAs give you a little breather between waves.This reminds me of a map I once made for Blood. Since I made it, I knew the order and where every secret was located at, and assumed everyone would be able to figure it out.Not the case. I received evey complaint about difficulty and got a bad score because I realized you could glitch the dogs at the first room by going prone under them, but not everyone else did.----------------About the AI----------------Jesus ♥♥♥♥ing Christ.Why on Earth would you allow allies to build within your influence if THERE IS NO RESOURCE SHARING!?SO. MANY. ♥♥♥♥ING. TIMES. I have had the AI claim all the resource spots when THEY'RE NOT EVEN THERE!I've only been able to play this with AI, since I haven't been able to get paired with someone online, but I'm absolutely certain you can get stuck with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ teammate that will steal every resource node from under you, leaving you wandering aimlessly, telling yourself ""Why did I download this?""I know it's an early access game. I don't care. It's currently not worth the buy.----------------About the customization----------------You'd think that for a game that boasts about customization, they'd have at least several different parts set up. So far, I've only seen:-first weapon-sword-pistol-rifle-shoulder rocket (single)-shoulder grenade launcherAll bodyparts are exactly the same, with slight variations in color.Oh yeah. There as a shield unit in there, but it was so weak that It was essentially the same as going naked.----------------Final thoughts----------------Right now it's not worth the buy. Maybe check again in a few months.Don't buy early access stuff this early! If they sell every copy during early access, they won't have any reason to finish the game!"

,Recommended,305510,16095932,"Posted: 31 May, 2015",all,FriendlyHenry,"So, what can I say about this game.If you want to read a whole review, then look no further. If you're one of THOSE guys, that just want to know if the game is good.....well...look no further either.Let's start with the short one.Game good. You play. You smile. You happy. The End.And now for those of you who want to know MY thoughts and experiences with the game. Also know, I go for a full blown out review, as such is my...way of the ninja? Cause I have quite a bit I really want to get out. So bare with me. Or not.First a little story about me.As a young little ninja child Age of Empires were pretty much my one favorite game. Even to this day it pretty much is. So you can probably understand that, when I read, and I quote, ""key create talent behind the beloved Age of Empires seriers"", I got pretty excited in my...head. So, no questions asked, it's an early access game, but who cares, I bought it and I bought it GOOD. I even straight ahead recommended it to a few friends whom I used to play AoE with as a child. Needless to say, they got pretty excited as well. I downloaded it, I played it and boy did I love it.I really love RTS games, if done right, and a RTS game with mechs makes it just all that better. Mecha games has a special place in my heart, so you must understand that, AoE creators making a new RTS game with a mecha theme, I got EXTREMLY excited. BUT enough about me and my love for RTS and mechas. Now about the game.Note that when you buy this game, you buy an EARLY ACCESS game, there isn't that much content as of yet.The game itself is really good and well balanced, going into combat doesn't feel like the enemy is outpowering yourself, but this is because of the fact that there currently only is ONE...faction I guess you could call it, Earth. More, probably, will be added later on. There are a few enjoyable game modes as well as maps, although VERY FEW, they are still enjoyable. From what I can tell there's only about 4 maps (or maybe it was 3? 5?, oh well), the game modes can vary depending on which map you chose. We got the standard Deathmatch, PvP or PvB.Also note that the maps are only able to hold up to two players at once. So playing with a friend against and AI bot is right now not a thing, unless you and your friend want to tackle the horde mode together against swarms of enemies. We also got the Arena mode where you play up to five maps in different ways, by betting 1000 cash, you can win, sometimes, quite a few good things at the end.Also, keep in mind that I haven't gone out to play against other human players yet. Not that I don't fancy it, but that I tried and failed. There's not THAT many playing yet. Most is still getting a hang of the game.The whole ""make your ideal team"" thing isn't all that good yet, but still good. There's not that many parts to chose from when it comes to weapons and such. There's only 3 pilots along with their Servos (as the mechas are called) available by the time I'm reviewing this. Each with his/her own special ability. But, despite the lack of weapons and such, there's still quite a bit of ways to make YOUR ideal team. There's your sword, shield, pistols and rifles and fists. Swords can be dual wielded or you can go with a shield in the off hand instead. Pistols can also be dual wielded, but I prefer the rifles to be honest. I do hope spears and axes as well as deployable mines.Let's take my current team, which I no doubt will change in the near future.(Edit: More than those weapons do exist. They are just higher level parts, such as a drill (dual wielding).(Edit #2: Deployable mines do exist within the game, found out playing against an ""Insane"" difficulty bot)I go for ""Sword and Shield along with a few launchers on the back"", a ""long range sniper along with some swarm missile launchers on back"" and then a ""dual wielding swords man, with a few tricks up his back as well"". By combining your ""heroes"" abilities you can do some devastating damage, with an EMP blast and a acid pool of awesomness on the ground and my sniper swarming the enemy with missiles, a enemy Servo can easily be taken down, and fast, as well as reducing the enemy forces to almost nothing. Combining your Servos abilities is almost a must if you want a quick and fast game.But getting new parts isn't all a walk in the park, you need to dedicate a few minutes, or hours to get some really good new parts. When you do get them good parts, boy do you feel like a child at Christmas getting getting that toy you really wanted, that you saw in the window of the toy shop when you and your mom when down to the mall to buy the rest of the families presents so you just walk past that window containing that awesomness. The parts can go from weapons, arms, heads, body, legs, shields as long as some other additions on the back and inside the Servo CPU system, kinda like rings in Diablo 3. Much of the customization feel like a good RPG game such as Diablo. You battle, you win, you get stuff, you equip said stuff (if good) and sell the rest for some scrap which can later be used to buy weapons of mass destruction.The whole base construction isn't all that yet. There's not that many building to chose from, but I figure more will be added later on. Such as missile turrets, walls, better units and more. Or at least this is what I hope for. Walls. And if the creators is reading this, think about this. Walls...on which you can place your turrets. Aaah? Not to shabby ey?Anyway, I love it, I'll keep on playing it. I'll support it. I'll master this. It's just that worth my time.So if you love Age of Empires, Diablo and also that one awesome mecha game for pc which is also a RTS game.Then, my friend, this is for you.LET ME REMIND YOU! This is a EA game, EA for Early Access. UNDERSTAND THAT before you buy it. I have a feeling ALOT more will be added in the time to come.To sum it all up.Game good. You play. You smile. You happy. The End.(With a few setbacks as the lack of maps, factions and a little crappy online play)"

There are bugs to deal with but it is early in game development so keep that in mind. I would like to see more content for the Mechs and possibly more Drones (Mini brawling drones, for front line fighting?). The game is similar to a MOBA/RTS play style. The game reminds me a lot of Warcraft 3 when Blizzard introduced heros into the RTS game play. There is great potential for this game but that doesnt mean it will amount to greatness. If the developers continue taking feed back from the community to heart to expand on the foundation they have laid, this will be a great game to pick up for 20 bucks."

Most the things that it need to function are missing and at times it just would operate. Hearing ""beta"" makes you cringe because you want instant satisfaction and dont want to wait for something that you paid for to slowly get better. But guess what? dont you twish you tested all those horrible games and told the makes to send that abomination back to spawning pits of cthulu's den. Your job as a beta tester is to break the game, post the problems and talk about what can make it better instead of stomping it out instantly. this game is that ""thing"", it's at the early months of developement and needs help to make it's way to where it can be that game the helps the rts franchise.Now to get back on track, the game is ok even for an early access game. they release at least one map a month including new parts and weapons. currently on each map there are different coop missions you can do with a buddy. You can deploy a team of three servos each having a pilot with different skills, and as your dropship level increases you can get more pilots. sadly at the moment you data will be wiped with every monthly update i think, have to put my ear to the ground to know if that will change, but at the same time it is a good thing because old stuff will be switched out with new and better items, as it progresses further i dont think they'll need to wipe as much (heh).THIS IS NOT A MOBA! When people see  a ""hero"" unit with much weaker and small units they think moba, but this is far from that, this a base building rts game with resources and base management. You might be tripped up when you see enemies are called creeps but it's not what you think, it's because the main enemy, the bloomspawn, do not need to build a base as they fall from the sky in meteors, they also play a part in pvp holding down refinery spots and on field resources.The Servos are giant mechs piloted by brave men and women with a hunger for destruction. Ever watched that movie Pacific Rim? well, you can think of it similar to that with different mechs of multiple designs and sizes and a large arsonal of weapons. Servo's are the units that you will use most in this game and put in in front when charging a base, there are smaller, faster and weaker units but they are mostly for providing support for the servos, like healing or long range sniping. but your servos are not invincible, they will blow up in a grand explosion thats almost worth the loss, you can bring them back after a long cool down but you have to know when and what to engage the enemy with.This game is a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of fun, no joke. you will spend a long time naming, costumizing and battling with your 60 meter monster. I geek out when ever a new update comes out cause i know its a whole list of new things! You can imagine my excitement when i heard their adding air units! I love seeing my servo duke it out with a massive Juggernaut looking bloomspawn! or launching a salvo of missles on a hoard of little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!! trust me when i say this is a game with a ton of potential."

The reason being is because this game is not toaster friendly as of currently.I bought this game thinking it would be great fun, and still do! The only problem is that I have a above average toaster. I tried to play this game and my average FPS was about 2-3. Once i turned down the setting to the third lowest possibility (to the point where this size text was made up of 4-7 pixels) the fps jumped up... to around 5-6 FPS.Basically im trying to say if you have a good computer get this game. Otherwise, you should probably save your money until later because this issue may be due to it being very early in the making.Toasters beware of the great and mighty servo!P.S. From what i have seen of it outside of the actual gameplay the game is awesome."

It could have been good! played too much and Valve refuses to give my money back. :/For those of you that remember Metal fatigue, this game scratches that itch! Although not as in-field dynamic as metal fatigue, such as being able to swap parts from fallen foes in the middle of battle. It does however let you customize your pilot, head, torso, legs and a weapon on each hand and each shoulder. Choice of weapons is pretty broad, which is nice.my only complaint? no WASD map move. It's either screen bump or using the arrow keys like it's 1999."

So far alot of the things I like, progression, loot, customization and RTS? Graphics are great,plays solid, fast load times and an intense and challanging pace. After a couple of losses and refitting, refining strategy I can now hold my own. If this stays on track, has good dev support, matching/pvp etc, could be my fav RTS for a long time."

For a Beta, its got quite alot of polish.It definitely has a long way to go before its time to release but that aside, the game play is fast and furious.Learn the hotkeys and use them!  Especially in coop skirmish with the AI. B for Build and Q for the Mine thingy..  (to name but a few)With only 2 story missions sofar (and 4 difficulties for each), you will spend most of your time doing skirmish's.  As you progress in Dropship XP you unlock extra pilots / servo's.Make sure you do the story missions as you also unlock a pilot and servo parts.  Overall.. loving the experience!  10/10Be aware that they occasionally do server wipes.. so if grinding isnt your thing.."

Laser things and missiles flying in the air, boom boom boom boom. Either your servo is still alive or dead and countdown to respawn the servo.There are just a few confusing moments in campaign missions. I didnt know that you can actually build around the servo (like a portable pylon, and buildings dont need constant power, only build and it can power itself). I kept creating Beacons at first, just like pylons with the protoss in starcraft, so i can reach power to build refinaries at the located spots... after some thinking of why was i able to build refinaries anywhere in the tutorial, it finally hit me, the servo controls the area to provide the ability to build near it. (buildings can provide its own power when built).i like how there is a shop to buy parts for the servo. its only a little confusing as it doesnt provide specific detail of how a noob can use this part and where it installs at, also has no compare feature for what current install.I completed the tutorial and then later complated the only 2 missions on insane mode. only 2 missions available in early-access so far... I find the 1st level is easy game-physics-learner level (i wasted couple hours on easy mode) and after some learn, was also easy on insane.2nd level on hard was very annoying as i was impatience, after a break from the game, i wasted time on hard mode but learned about it when i played insane mode. insane was also a bit annoying because that 1 single tank comes out every few minutes and will eventually kill you (complete level fail) because of not enough health around. i spent most the time using a slow reload missile shot to take down dozen enemies (slow couple hours for a single mission). quite boring from the repetetive wait-wait-wait-missile wait-wait-wait-missile.Its a bit annoying to learn optimization for each level completely by yourself (an un-addict would just quit playing the game, like most the games i bought on steam sale)"

76561198005767652,Recommended,305510,16187293,"Posted: 4 June, 2015",all,Golden Paw,"Well I have to admit I was very eager to get this game: Giant fighting mech suits, Exp system, loot and a whole load of other pluses? I couldn't stay away.The overall impression is that this game has potential to be a huge amount of fun, even for an Alpha stage game I was actually impressed with several of the mechanics involved.The building system for the RTS side of it is simple to pick up and after a few games you will, be putting your roots down quickly and getting on with the fun part of smashing the enemy to bits.As for the customisation of your mechs? Well yet again has great potential. Whether you're a gunslinger, boxer or sniper there are loadouts for you. There is as yet no options to customise colour so your look is completely down to what gear you have.The basic weapons are complemented by extra things like shields and rockect pacs so the potential for a wide range of fighting styles is in the pipeline and mix that in with each poilet's own powers I feel I will be dreaming up new builds for weeks at least.A key refreshing element is the servo team idea itself, you with every tech level you get an additional servo to use in game from the stock of already unlocked pilots. By early mid game you can have a whole squad of stompy mechs to deal damage with.So the rougher points:Obviously the game isn't finished, so while it's good fun to play a few times right now you will quickly chew through the early access content. Though even this isn't too bad as even though you can't access all the cool things now they are there, especially in with the A.I controlled servos who are armed with some of the shinier things you will be able to get just to make you drool and feel good about yourself as you pound their over geared mechs to scrap ^_^On the subject of the A.I, sadly they will not tax you terribly right now, with only basic commands and some almost hilariously stupid actions (Ignoring your entire army/base defences to chase one little drone round and around or just sitting at their own base scratching their heads as you claim the whole map. But as I said before early days.There is some balancing issues to be resolved, but yet again that is nothing new to a work in progress game. Some one of the two co-op levels is simply impossible with an A.I ally to complete while the other is hardly taxing at all. Unless you raise it the next difficulty and watch your A.I ally dance in circles.The only major gripes I have is the loot drops and lack of other players right now. It is almost sole destroying to earn the in game currency, playing for hours for what feels like terrible small gains. From what I have seen it takes at least four games to earn a reasonable quality loot crate which turns out to be another gun you don't need.This is offset somewhat by the 'daily quests' where you have to achieve certain goals like building ten base turrets ect, but in my experience it's not enough.Yes you've crushed your foe in an epic battle, ground his servos to scrap and blasted his base to atoms. You finally catch your breath and find what feels like a couple of loose coat buttons and can of knock off soft drink for your troubles.The devs has stated that the early release focuses on multiplayer right now, which is all fine and dandy except the teaming up engine seems to be lacking at the moment. I was lucky to find a fellow player to duke it out with (In co-op or PVP) having only had about five games with other people since I got the game a few days ago, less than one in ten searches resulting in a match.So to conclude my review I would say this game will be awesome if they keep up the good work. As for buying it right this second? Not so sure. You will have a few hours fun testing out the basic format and gaming system. If you have a dedicated friend to play it with, to strive and overcome the co-op missions or to beat the snot out of in PVP then the fun will last longer.I would see it as a long term investment, the more people who support the game now will hopefully encourage the devs and we will see more cool content sooner. The big promise that is given is this game will not be a 'pay to win', everything will be included in the one time payment of the game.Over all I'd give this a thumbs up, with hope that it lives up to expectations. Buy investing in the game you make it more likely that a real gem will be at the end of the tunnel. If you're not up for that risk then it may be worth waiting to see where it goes."
