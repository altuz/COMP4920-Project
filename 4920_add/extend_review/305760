76561198022266051,Recommended,305760,29795912,Posted: 8 February,all,OakenPants,"Pretty cool, very well done and challenging puzzle game!  What more could you want?The object is to simply get the Red and Blue robots to their Red and Blue respective ""X""s.  To accomplish this and guide them down the desired path, you place obstacles in their way knowing that robots always move forward until they hit an obstacle at which point Red robots turn right, and Blue robots turn left.Throughout the campaign new ideas are introduced such as platforms that raise and lower when a robot crosses them, or one-way ""moving sidewalks"".The game is simple, but definitely gets quite challenging.  I was stuck on one level in particular for quite awhile.   That said, the game is still pretty short.  The 45 levels of the campaign I managed tocomplete in 3.0 hrsper Steam.  But, to extend the game there is a level-editor and you can download additional levels from the Steam Workshop.The PROs:+ Very well done and Polished+ Nice graphics+ Simple to pick-up and start playing+ Levels get very challenging+ Steam Workshop for additional levelsThe CONs:- Maybe a little short campaign.  But that's all I can think of as a ""con"" really.Overall:  It's a neat little puzzle game and well-worth playing.  8.5 / 10."

,Recommended,305760,26267560,"Posted: 28 October, 2016",all,interesting Output,"This game .. is quite well-polished, with the graphic quality and presentation on a rather clean scale. Fundamental mechanics are explained right off the bat, and the text presentation of what must be done in the early puzzles is spot-on.The game has you operating the ship's teleportation system to beam in obstacles to help robots move to their designations. However, puzzles often call for you to set a delay in teleporting obstacles -- once an obstacle is placed, it cannot be removed.The nice features of this game involve letting you ""rewind"" to the start of the puzzle if something's amiss, allowing you to make changes, and try again. And in the case playing your solution takes too long, you can temporarily fast-forward, for as long as you hold that button down.And in the case you solve all the puzzles, there's Workshop support where you can download others' puzzles -- or upload your own.Overall, well worth the price. Recommended if you enjoy puzzle games.(Reviewer's note: the publisher of this game is known for a huge Minecraft mod, ""Computercraft"", as well as an assisting developer of other mods, including Sven Coop. Don't let this tidbit change your judgement, though.)"

You need to redirect robots through a maze to get to the goal. Blue robots turn left and (R)ed robots turn (R)ight when encountering an obstacle. There are fixed obstacles in the puzzles but the player places additional ones to redirect the robots.Graphic style is clean and simple, music is soothing but can get slightly repetative after a while.All in all the game feels very polished and I have not yet encountered a single bug or issueThe puzzles are not very challenging and there are ""only"" 45 of them (according to description), but I imagine that they would be perfectly suited for a younger audience. The game does have a level editor and workshop support so I suspect that, given time, there are going to be plenty of puzzles of varying difficulty available there.Although I may sound negative, I do enjoy the game and I wholeheartedly recomend it"

He makes the computercraft mod for Minecraft and I heard about this game through one of Direwolf20's recent Let's Plays.

The puzzles strike the right balance between difficulty and fun, and with a level editor to create your own, you can never run out of puzzle fun.On the side, there's also arcade games you can play, which are fun litle time wasters for if you're stuck on a puzzle.

The price is great for the amount of content, which as it has full modding support (no suprise at it was made by the author of a popular minecraft mod: computercraft) will only get better. Will be interesting to see what appears on the workshop.Take an evening off, put your headphones in and get solving.
