Dev literally dropped whatever he was doing to fix the bug immediately. That's what I can call dedication!The game itself is beautiful and unique.

,Recommended,305780,10467058,"Posted: 13 June, 2014",all,Vession,"As simple as the game seems at first, you'll soon be making mad dashes for berries as the sun sets and genuinely wondering whether or not you'll be able to survive through the next day. Cursing your tools for breaking just before felling a tree, finding out that you don't have enough wood to keep your tootsies warm all night..The gameplay is pretty simple, you're gathering for most of the game with your hands or with the relentlessly degrading tools you can make. The rewards of your survival are even more tools to help you survive longer, so it can be hard to feel like you're really getting anywhere until you manage to get your 10th character to actually make it through the harsh winter. Then it's time to prepare for the next winter.The game was recently updated with difficulty levels. This was done in response to community complaints about the time you spend just trying to survive presenting too large an obstacle in regards to progressing with the story. There's now the option for a ""casual"" mode, which will surely make things a little easier and less frustrating for those of us who make mistakes or are just generally unlucky."

I very much recommend it for lovers of fantasy-style wilderness survival games and it has a surprisingly high amount of strategy to it.The atmosphere of the game feels so tranguil yet with an edge of tingling suspense and is further supported by the magical artwork and music. You can be walking peacefully through the beautiful forests with birds flying and chirping around you, then suddenly a big black horror appears in front of you doing ungodly things to another version of you! It's a crazy mind-trip of a ride for sure. The writing throughout is also just so creative and whimsical.I played on the Sedate game mode which I read removes some of the wilderness survival gameplay. I had a quick look on the Normal mode and it appears you have to do the traditional wilderness survival things like collecting wood for the fire. I'm thankful the developers made this an option as there is already a lot going on in this game and it can feel overwhelming, especially when playing for the first time.The gameplay involves you exploring through a wide variety of environments. Wind-swept mountains, sandy beaches, steamy jungles, frog-filled swamps, they're all here, including some real bizzare ones too! The game walks an interesting line between real-looking places and the fantasical. You need to learn how to make tools and clothes and upgrade your camp as well as find the materials to make those items. The way you have to find food also changes through the seasons, then there's the weather to contend with. The main focus though is the wider story-line in play where you uncover the secrets of why you're there (revealed in yet more weird♥♥♥♥♥dreams and scenes), and involves you solving strange puzzles to unlock new routes and ultimately the finding of jewelry pieces to enter the end-game.There is solid strategy gameplay here with real depth. It can take time to understand the mechanics of the game simply because there's so many things to balance and figure out, but once you do it's one hell of a lovely journey!9/10"

,Not Recommended,305780,23404231,"Posted: 5 June, 2016",all,Onkel Stinkern' McMøkkakjeller,"I keep coming back to this game after quitting over and over in frustration, because Iwantto like it.The shrouded plot and slowly unraveling story is great, but there are some decisions made with this game that I'm surprised survived all the way to release.You start off in a forest, and a ghost is talking to you. You are being nudged in which direction to explore by this ghost showing up at times, and by dream sequences and oddities you discover in the game world. The game is very much about figuring out what's going on. This part is enjoyable, but there is another part to the game as well. True to indie studios this title couldn't escape the survival aspect. Surviving means gathering food and logwood for a campfire to not starve to death, and regularly drinking water from streams. Ok, so what's so bad about that? Well, a number of things.To get food you need to find a place with food. To get wood you need to chop down trees, either with an axe you have to learn a schematic for, or by using a saw-like branch from a specific type of bush. Chopping or sawing drains your food meter. To find these bushes, these trees, the food crops, and the place where you get schematics, you need to explore. When you explore you are never guaranteed to find the place you are looking for, and you can only remember twelve (or is it nine?) areas, true to the amnesia of your ingame avatar. Traveling takes time. You can only expect to visit two to three areas in one day, and when night comes, you better have wood ready for the fire, or sleeping in the cold will drain a lot of your food/health meter.To eat food you have to, at least in the early game, travel to one of very few areas with berries and mushrooms. Sometimes the bushes carry plenty of berries, sometimes not. This is as far as I can tell completely random. Keep in mind that just traveling there takes up half a day, and you also need wood for your fire. There are ways to get food in other ways, but they require you to get crafting schematics from a shrine. Traveling to the shrine takes time, and you need to donate food or something else (won't spoil it) to get a schematic. You never know what schematic you get, or how many there are in total, but you can only remember twelve (or nine, can't remember) at a time. Starting to see a pattern here? None of this has to do with advancing the story.You can of course, also only carry with you six or so items at any given time, be they tools like axes, or food, or logwood.The problem here should start to be obvious: You are forced to backtrack alotjust to stay alive. There are schematics to make things easier, but getting there feels like a grind, and the sheer timesink aspect of this game really detracts from the fun part of exploring and discovering secrets. In between running around gathering wood and food, hoping you get the right schematic, hoping you find the right zone, and cursing your six item inventory and 2 minute day cycle, it really seemed like the developer thought the ""amnesia-mechanic"" was a fun new idea that he wanted to force to work, no matter how clunky it really is in practice.It begs the question of why this is in the game at all. I heard it was a lot harder to survive in earlier patches, but right now it isn't hard, it's time consuming. I don't like it when games waste my time. Ihateit when games waste my time, for no appearent reason to boot. Was this kept in the game because of the ""survival"" tag that is mandatory it seems for indie games these days? Was it because the developer was afraid that the game would be too short otherwise?I'm going to keep playing this game for a bit longer, because I spent money on it and I really do hope that it gets better, but I can't get past how impractical this system really is and how I do not understand the purpose of it beyond an attempt to set itself apart from other games.If you are okay with timesinks, and you like mysterious exploration games, you should check it out. Otherwise, don't bother."

The goal is to survive long enough to unravel the mystery of the Wilds. It requires good time and resource management skills and the puzzles are challenging enough to warrant busting out pen and paper. High replay value if you are the type of person who likes to beat your own score. I've logged nearly 120 hrs on this game and have only completed it twice. The RNG makes each new game progress differently; I still haven't managed to solve all the special areas.Echo manages to pack a lot in and still feel minimalist. The gameplay is straightforward and doesn't have any hacky tricks up its sleeves (bears won't suddenly raid your camp at night). The pacing feels like old school PC games (Myst, Sierra's catalog): low-stress and highly enjoyable. And not to worry, the love-it-or-loathe-it twee dialog fades into the background after awhile.Great for anyone who loves nature, personal challenges, and/or the unconventional. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a non-traditional game. 10/10"

I tried to play it a year ago or so and bounced off it the first time around, so I'll say I think you need to be in the right mood for it. The crafting, the rules, the mechanics -- none of these things are spelled out for you and so you need to embrace a sort of crazy whimsey and dive in head first. Stay alive and discover the world around you. Use the beginners guide if you need to in the community hub, but also just enjoy the exploration and prepare to die and try again! Now with more whimsey!On a seperate note, if you go to the discussions area, you'll see that the developer has personally responded to the majority of the posts with guidance and advice or even with gratitude for bringing a bug/imbalance to light (and then with actual statements that the problem has been fixed!).

It is very playable now. Still a challenging game, but the survival aspect no longer overpowers the puzzle/discovery parts. The style is cool, and the story is unique. Definitely worth buying even at the full price (totally a steal on sale).Only warning is that there isn't a very interactive community around the game unless you want to come in and make one.

The art is excellent.This game is difficult, no question. It would take a VERY long time and many playthroughs to work out everything yourself. Fortunately, the Steam discussions and wiki are available and will help you if you're stuck, confused by a crafting recipe, etc. If the survival aspects are too tough or time-consuming, as some reviewers are saying, then play casual mode.

Strange nightmares, visions, hallucinations are all the way.This game has stunning art design (a bit odd, but really beautiful), atmospheric music and interesting concept.But there are some annoying moments: days are way too short, you can perform only few tasks per day. Also you have to waste a lot of time getting food and trees (yeah, more difficult, but also boring, considering initially you have only 5 inventory slots). And the controls are bizarre.And it would be really great to see some achievements that match the game's tone.So, even if it's not perfect, I highly recommend you to buy this game to support talanted developers."
,Recommended,305780,21584798,"Posted: 2 March, 2016",all,DaClems,"10 Hours in.Right off the bat, I love this game's approach to learn-as-you-go ""crafting"". The interface isn't overly cumbersome like most survival games out on the market. You must choose when to seek crafting recipes and slowly make room for new items as you hit crafting milestones. Crafting is both rewarding and fun. You'll find that searching for the right materials is more like a scavenger hunt than a chore, though you will need to grind wood and food.Inventory management left me frustrated, yet adequately challenged. Having only six slots available in the beginning is the biggest challenge for me. Fumbling your items around the camp in clustered piles is a necessity, since the craftable camp-storage upgrade limits you to two small chests (10 slots per chest).As you discover more about the game's ""secret economy"", you will find equipment that becomes hard-locked to your person, meaning it cannot be dropped. It is crucial that you craft the Palm Sack or you will eventually become too encumbered to continue. In my 2nd playthrough, I made it past day 40, with two hard-locked items and no Palm Sack, which meant 4 free spaces available at any given time. As a result, I met my demise, since I wasn't able to collect enough wood to keep from freezing at night.The story so far has been very engaging, slightly creepy, and somewhat obscure. Overall it works in harmony with the gameplay and art design. The game doesn't rush you in the beginning, giving you ample time to wander around and discover things. However, you should work fast because as the season change, food becomes more scarce. If you are unprepared for Autumn, you may find yourself in a bad way.The graphics are simplistic, yet beautiful. The pixelated sprites have just enough definition to be recognizable as their real-world counterparts. The art design is incredible all around, especially in the dreamlike sequences.Having just binged two playthroughs in a 10 hours timespan, I would highly recommend this game to anyone interested in a semi-casual survival game without the typical gameplay tropes that plague the genre. Yes, there is thirst, hunger, and a day-night cycle. However, these elements serve the game well and do not detract from the enjoyment of the journey.I give Echo of the Wilds a 10/10 because it easily outshines other survival games in my library, of which I have many."

In Echo of the Wilds not only are you totally confused, excited and totally lost about what's happening, but you just want to keep going, you'll also work, HARD, for your bizarely-shaped character to stay alive through the night.It's actually easy to understand, you'll know exactly where the needed items are to eat, drink, antidotes and such. But your daily limited time is going to make you choose, and believe me when I say your decisions matter. You could very easily die since it was too dark already to collect some wood because you just HAD to craft yourself that damn axe you wanted to use TO GET WOOD IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!...I mean... Yeah, sometimes it's about getting through the night in one piece with as much health as possible, priviledges like storage or a hammer can wait... I don't know, 10 days? Even more?And just so you know. You have limited inventory to 5 items, and since cutting down a three or getting stone takes 2-3 usable items to get, that means you have 2 to use freely, sometimes. Places? There are a few, but you can only memorize 15 of them meaning you'll have to decide which ones you want to leave to luck to stumble upon.Don't get me wrong, though. It's hard in a very good way, it devours you. Nothing else matters for hours but this game, day after day, allucination after allucination.Oh, did I mention the Save feature requires you to offer food? Yes, you're trying to survive and since you are about to die you'd want to save the game, just in case, right? Sure, just bring some food you don't have to Save a game you're going to lose anyway!...In a few words. This is the most interesting, punishing and relaxing/rage inducing survival game you'll ever play, and it's worth every minute of your time even if it gets you NOWHERE!I like the game, but there should be an Easy mode somewhere.

The pixel graphics are pretty and haunting, the music is nice, the elements of a good game are there, but the deal-breakers are too severe to make it overall enjoyable.The game has a crafting system. What is the weak part of every game with a crafting system? Inventory management. This game starts you with 6, count 'em 6, inventory slots, and items don't stack. Also items you use to harvest other crafting items break, often before you can collect a single crafting material (it takes at least 2-3 pebbles to collect a rock to make an axe, for instance, or at least 2 thorny plants to chop down a sapling--pebbles and rocks are found in different maps by the way).On top of that, you can only visit 2, possibly 3 locations per day. Fewer if the storyline decides to teleport you away from what you wanted to do, which it does a lot in the beginning. So you end up with this situation in which you have to either start over a few times or know exactly what you're doing, and run around between locations with exactly the right inventory items, to make your harvesting tools, to keep from starving or freezing to death in the beginning.Even then, resource management with a tiny inventory and breakable items continues to be the bulk of what you spend your time doing. People are saying they beat the game after 70-100 in-game days, and it's because you can barely do any game elements beyond basic survival, due to the limited inventory and limited exploration time available.There was a pleasant, fun, short-ish game in here somewhere, that got buried in totally tedious, punishing, and un-fun repetition. If you can buy it for a dollar, play for an hour or 2, not expecting anything beyond seeing some weird things and dying and giving up."

This time I'll be sure to always collect an abundance of firewood (which by the way isn't easy to get in high stock). I never want to experience that nightmare again.""This next story is really just an experience that I had, not a review of the game. This may be a spoiler, I have no idea. You've been warned.So the first few nights I slept through I did not get enough wood for a fire to last the whole night. All this seemed to cause was a dream (actually a nightmare), so I thought it wasn't a big deal. What could happen?  A wild animal that I could either kill or run away from? No. These dreams started to get worse, and quickly turned into nightmares that would probably leave real life me awake quaking in bed if I had had them  (I am a 17 year old male). First there were deers... Then there were deer satan. Then Satan.Then I was finally given a dream that I could manipulate. I was thrown face to face with Deer Satan himself, and had to run for my life towards a light. At first I did not realize this, so he got AWEFULLY close to me, and the whole run was terrifying. But I escaped. Then continued on with my business. I decided that today would be a good time to start stock piling wood. I never wanted that event to happen to me ever again. I was walking passed a tree when suddenly Deer Satan embodied behind me out of sight, and proceeded to chase me. Again. All I had to do to escape this was run away for a short time, and he dissapeared. No big deal? Normally things like these progress somewhat slowly in games. It would either happen again a long time from now with increasing frequency every time I missed a night, or it would stop all together until another bad dream. I was wrong. I was so wrong. I had calmed down just in time for Dear Satan to appear in front of me again about fifteen seconds later, this time in broad daylight. Oh, also he was faster. It was so terrifying I immediately closed the game. This Indie survival game that had no ""Horror"" tag was so scary I quit on the spot. So yeah, that was my experience. Will I ever play again? I don't know. Maybe one night I'll go back to it. This time I'll be sure to always collect an abundance of firewood (which by the way isn't easy to get in high stock). I never want to experience that nightmare again."

However, the survival and adventure aspects of this game are very much at odds with each other. You spend way too much time looking at loadscreens for the amount of gameplay in any given area. Imagine playing an old adventure game like King's Quest, except with annoying and unnecessary visuals while transitioning between areas. Now make those areas about 1/10th the size of a traditional adventure game. I suppose what I'm getting at is the pacing, it is terrible. The process of giving food to find recipes is also boring. In fact, a lot of the survival aspects are just poorly shoehorned into the game.I like the general concept and I hope the developer attempts to improve upon it."

Dev must have been slacking./sThis game reminds me of Myst or Obduction. It is not as relaxed as Obduction because there is a time pressure and I believe that is a good thing. It may feel gindy at times but perhaps instead of grinding there is a more efficient way to get resources thus it is another puzzle waiting to be solved.8/10. Would rage at a puzzle agaain.

I want to play it, but I'm sick of the crashing. Writing this review 30 seconds after the second time, I was about 2 game days away from finishing it. Now I'm about 15 game days away from finishing it. Maybe have it auto save every day? Or two days? Just my thoughts."

Can tend to lose its charm a little though, the survival mechanics can become a little bit annoying rather than rewarding. It's the sort of game you need a wiki for which currently doesn't really exist. It was a nice start and I can see myself coming back to this game at some point so it's staying on my computer for now, but buyer beware, this is a dubious thumbs up, there's a lot this game could be that it simply wasn't, although maybe I'm just very bad :)"

76561198081726564,Recommended,305780,21338815,"Posted: 20 February, 2016",all,AWinrarIsMeee,"GameplayThe basic gameplay follows the usual wilderness survival tropes. You require food and water and need some wood to burn each night as you sleep otherwise you lose stamina and potentially become ill. The way you get food changes with the seasons which makes things interesting, as one day you can rely on catching rabbits, but then the next day you'll have to build a fishing rod to fish.Once you learn the little tricks basic survival becomes trivial which in this case is a good thing because there are plenty of other things you'll need to do to complete the game. First you need to find the knowledge and supplies to craft tools, clothes and camp upgrades. Then there are certain areas that involve puzzles which at times have you exploring around areas for solutions or specific items needed to complete the puzzle.The game can feel very over-whelming, but that's simply down to the fact you have a high degree of freedom to play through the game how you want. However, much of the game is based on using your time and collecting the right items from the right areas. I feel the game would be immesarbly improved if for example there are fun minigames or the actual act of hunting for rabbits and fish were more of a minigame themselves. Like other survival games there is a danger of the act of surviving feeling more like a chore, which I hope is addressed in future updates.There is a high degree of randomness to the areas you find and each of the puzzles themselves have random elements. This spices up the gameplay well and keeps things fresh each time you play the game to learn more about it.StoryThe story is told through the many dreams and narrative scenes. It can be quite cryptic at times so you need to really think about what's happening. It's quite profound at times but ultimately I felt it a bit lacking as there simply wasn't enough narrative scenes over the course of the game. There are also special areas where you meet ghosts of people which I enjoyed, but again I would appreciate there being more to make the world really come to life and feel as vibrant as the graphics.Graphics and MusicThis along with the gameplay is where it really shines. The graphics are beautiful, combining retro art with modern visual effects. The environments are very varied, from grasslands to lush jungles to dark bottomless cave systems. The music is so calming and perfectly compliments the environmental sounds of birds cheeping, waves crashing, etc. If you like pixel art then this game is faultless."
