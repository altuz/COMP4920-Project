I felt extremely unclean after my first play though due to an abundance of flashing colors strobing and exploding on screen, sorta like watching Walt Disney throw-up after a bad drug trip.  It makes you seriously consider defenestration as a viable option.  Does this review make sense? it shouldn't.  And I think that's  the stylistic point of this game (a collection of mini-esque games wrapped in a loaf of kung-fu).  I think I'll go back and play it s'more.  I'm recommending this for: the 8 bit crowd, the minamalist/experimental crowd, and the crowd over there eyeing me as if my days are numbered.  This is not for the photosensitive crowd nor the people that shun the philosophy of dogs.  You may like this, or you may opposite of like this."

If you've got the money to spend and are into that then it's worth it. but if you expect a game with great gameplay and a compelling story go elsewhere.

,Recommended,305800,18648877,"Posted: 23 October, 2015",all,Doshington,POP: Methodology Experiment OneI first came across this game looking for a new profile background. When I saw this [art piece] I was interested to find out just what it was all about. After buying it and trying to figure out just what to be doing I started to kind of get it. Then I found and option to turn on commentary to learn just what I had finished.This is not a game for everyone.4/10 Gameplay: It's short and confusing if you don't know how to play it.9/10 Style: It's got style for days.I highly suggest the in-game commentary option. It felt like I was taking a gallery tour.
,Not Recommended,305800,24172308,"Posted: 7 July, 2016",all,OZWA,"This is a paragon example of why avant garde games a) are difficult to make and b) why people think they can't be done well.It exhibits all of the traits of a faux avant garde experience -- tedious, insipid, and artlessly self aware.It enshrouds itself in the bulwark of 'experience' by giving you incoherent injections of culturally loaded symbolism and events.  There's no mystery to unpack because it's just mystery qua mystery.  It'd be a mystery if the designer herself knew the answers.  It's one thing to be oblique but it's another to be a complete reckless void.It's a collection of minigames that aren't fun nor compelling.  The worst is the desert walk, but I'm not certain if that's due to its scraps of highschool poetry or its absurdly slow pacing.  A close second is the storm boat experience.There's probably more things to unlock, but why should anyone play an array of hideously designed games in order to lock more ways to test their patience and good taste?There's random clips of dated media spliced into an amalgamation that's likely meant to make me 're-consider' pop culture and its panoply of cultural connotations.  It feels like a trope to even mention this trope.  Also you wouldn't believe that this game also has a few anti-war messages awkwardly wedged in the gaps.The aesthetics are especially aggravating.  All of the standard psychedelic effects would be interesting if they had any complexity or nuance to them.  The aesthetics feel less like another cash-in of the current retro-nostalgia fetish and more like the inability of the designer to visually articulate interesting forms.This feels like a student project that should have remained one."

Instead we get some bare bones shooting galleries making some hackneyed statement on war, driving straight out of a late 90's flash game, a ""puzzle"" constructed exclusively out of obnoxioius flashing colors, and several sections I couldn't even control. The controls are not told to you at the begining, I could barely navigate the menu, I couldn't even exit the game! The music isn't much to speak of either, the driving and walking bits are alright, but I've heard much better in the same style elsewhere.I'm not one of those who dismiss artsy ""not a games"" but this is just frustrating and grating."

Really. I'm not kidding.Often on sale for under $2 or even $0.99, buying POP is a no brainer for fans of video games who appreciate creativity, experimentation, interactive experiences, and wild aesthetics, as well as great music and sound design. Actually, the music is better than great.Fans of trippy games or interactive experiences should absolutely get this without a second thought. Yes, it is short. I guess a first playthrough took me about 20 minutes, but it is a memorable experience and has great replayability. It's an immersive 20 minutes to say the least. You will be entertained, perplexed at times, and surprised. I've never played anything else like it .To put it simply, the game has 7 minigames sandwiched between interesting imagery and short video montages. It is up to the player to figure out how to play the minigames. And for a few, the objective isn't even readily apparent.You'll be dropped into a boat during a thunderstorm, a highway car race, a war helicopter, a walk in the desert, a space shuttle launch, and a game similar to Missile Command. The presentation of the games is very pixelish and retro. Even outside of the minigames, pressing certain keys will affect music and artwork. The main menu itself is an exercise in interactive experimentation. The music is FANTASTIC.I got the game on sale for over a dollar I think. It is always on sale. But, for real fans of this sort of thing, the full price of $3.99 is very reasonable. It's the price of a fancy cup of coffee or a beer. This will stay with you long after playing just once. I've played this at least 5 times and still notice new things. Did I mention the OST?"

In some scenes, you don't know if pressing keys does affect the game at all- The options menu is no use at all. rebinding keys does not work- Loading times. For just a small scene, it can take a modern computer up to half a minute to load- General slowness. Press a button for two seconds to continue here, press it for six seconds to continue there. Seriously: WTF?!- No storytelling, no moral, no underlined questions, no nothing.- Considering these aspects, getting all achievements will become a tough challenge, to say the leastResult (and summary for those who have no time reading):POP's an art game designed by some art-related guy for art students primarily. At least that's what it felt like for me. Actually, being an enthusiastic player of games with a little weird spin, playing it didn't enrich me at all. Plus, short length, screwed controls and loading times impair the playing experience negatively.Thus I do not recommend buying this game at all."

This game absolutely did not feel like that for me. Maybe I didnt play it long enough but after the opening sequence really felt like it was testing my resilience against having an epileptic seisure, then subsequent mini-games which make no sense, the music feeling like it was not the star of the show, and literally feeling like I WAS going to have a seisure, I had to turn this game off...I'm not really sure what they were going for here but honestly I have to say that what this game does best is cause confusion and induce seisures. I mean, literally... before you can play the game it makes you accept that it might kill you before proceeding. COOLAnyway look, it just wasnt a pleasant experience. You could make an argument that the art and video clips in this game are supposed to get at some deeper meaning about the state of society and moral blah blah but that aspect of this game really was not executed well. If you want to play a game which lambasts the shotcomings of modern society try this lesser known dystopian gem: ""Beyond good and evil"" There are others but I really need to go lay down after playing this game...
