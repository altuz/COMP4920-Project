,Recommended,305840,22220063,"Posted: 3 April, 2016",all,LeoTindall,"NOTE: Early Access Review, 2016-04-03TL;DR was TL;DR: Buy it. Right now. Video review athttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzwwVeWKwNcTL;DR: Do you like Rome: Total War? Do you like Homeworld? Then you absolutely must buy this game. Are you a fan of RTSs but never played Rome or Homeworld? Give it a try anyway. Are you a CoD or DOTA player who's never touched real time strategy? Buy it for the pretty spaceships and explosions. Basically, buy it.So, what is it? In short, it's Rome: Total War in space. Line up armies, face them off against eachother. A campaign mode is coming, but is not here yet. It's so much more, as well; ship and fleet customization give it a whole extradimensionof depth above most RTSs. Nonetheless, it's very intuitive and feels incredibly responsive.The good:Graphics and UI are beautiful and very well designedThe UI, while not typical of RTS games, is impressively intuitive. I went from ""how do I move"" to feeling like Ender in  about ten minutes, WITHOUT a tutorial. The Tab-key locking and simple move queuing makes complex strategies a joy to plan and execute.The UI again - it's so good, it deserves another entry. With such a complex game to control, and what with not being finished yet, the game could be forgiven for being confusing and hard to learn, but it'snot. In addition to what I've mentioned, the game slows when planning moves or when enemies are first detected, giving you the chance to think a little more about strategy - very important for new players.The music. I'm not sure if it's dynamic or not, but it's highly appropriate, highly atmospheric, and greatly enhances the immersion.The fleet maneuver dynamics. Watching an entire flotilla wheel around and steam head first into the enemy, guns blazing, might not be the most astute strategy, but it's certainly impressive. Even just flying a fleet around in space is fun.The bad:The most obvious first: It's not finished. There is no campaign mode and no tutorial. There will be - the buttons for them are there - but they aren't implemented yet. Honestly, I don't think a tutorial is really necessary, but I for one will be happy to see the campaign mode.Minor gripes in re: not being finished yet: I'd like to be able to move the camera by clicking on the minimap, and a few other things like that, but really who cares? It's Early Access. They'll fix it.A few observations:When I first started up a skirmish, I didn't realize it was fully 3D. I accidentally held down the left button during a move and saw the prediction line shoot up into the void, and I thought, ""I could really get lost out here."" That's a great thing, in my book: a space game that really gives a good idea of the vastness of space.I run Linux - an unsupported version, no less - and the game runs flawlessly. I do appreciate that effort from the devs.Conclusion:Buy it. Just buy it. It's only $15, and it's already an incredible game - and it's certainly not going to get worse as Early Access goes on.EDIT: Yes, I posted this review after playing for about 30 minutes. The game really is that easy to pick up."

The game is way too polished, too much work has been invested in it to think a dev would kill a project this big just like that.

The problem, however, is this game needs more time to bake.  The UI needs a lot of work (which I understand they're working on, which is fantastic!), the sandbox elements are very confusing (Yes, I researched, but my google-fu came up mostly empty), and I couldn't figure out how to custom design my ships (yes, I found the wrench), though I admit it's possible overlooked something.  The tutorials are lacking beyond basic controls and ship types/weapons, with no information how to access the more advanced features, but I know this will get fleshed out in time.For now, I say skip, but I'm going to be watching this game.  There's a lot of potential here, and I really hope it gets the development time it deserves, and it looks like it will.On a technical note, when this game crashes, it crashes the most gracefully I've EVER seen a program crash.  It doesn't lock up.  It doesn't crash to desktop.  It goes to console, copies the error into your clipboard, and tells you how to exit.  As a software engineer, this is beautiful design."

The UI design needs work but for the most part is both clean and functional.   The way the dev has built their game areas and connected them together is both novel and effective at making you feel the void of space.Combat I think needs more work, as right now your forces quickly devolve into a jousting match, especially if any ships have frontal weapons.  This might be remedied by increasing the weapon range or decreasing ship speed.I will be watching this game with much anticipation.

The two modes I saw were - 'Start' and 'quick battle' start drops you into a strange region of space where friendlies fly about their business and you command military ships. Except without any weapons and directive. Quick battle on the other hand was interesting where you can command ships in combat and is the games true focus, but again some ships had no weapons and from what I understand there used to be a ship builder in game and since I cannot access this feature I have to say it was not an enjoyable experience. I had difficulty understanding what was going on in game + the controls are mind numbingly complex and annoying. However I shall stay interested in it's development"

There's only two options: Quick match and start; without any intro as to what is going on unless the idea truly is free form floating through space exploring gas clouds. The UI for ship controls are pretty weak, some small graphics can really make them pop.Until I can figure out what I'm doing and how to do it I have to give a raah, raahhh.."

Even I do not want to be called names at. !!According to steam 'early acces' means: get instant acces and START PLAYING. That last is not possible, so no, i cannot recommend this game. Let me explain.I cannot play the game because i found the controls horrific and the game crashes within 2 till 5 minutes of it. I posted the problem and a developer responded to it. To my question when the problem is fixed, the answer was 'perhaps next week, perhaps not'. Wel, if i cannot play the game and there is a possibility that i can never play the game, then a refund i guess.To the person whome thinks i'm an idiot or my review should be wrong because others state it is a good game: i think it is not. Besides the problems i have with the game itself (this can be fixed in the future) i found the game not that exciting after all.Yes the universe (background) looks awesome, it really does. But ask yourself, do you see this even after a few gams? I do not, the gameplay itself should be awesome, sadly it is not.My advise: let the developpers first prove that they can finish this game till a version where it is playable, then look it up."

Controls are confusing as there are no keybinds to analyze/customize and the Help window isn't very useful. Can't customize ships like before. I mean, it still looks great but, despite the newest update, I feel like it has lost some of the gameplay aspects I had originally got it for.The game has died anyways so I'm not expecting it to make a sudden comeback. How unfortunate. It had so much potential."

They've taken a sidestep and had to re-evaluate the direction they wanted to take the game after we gave them a bunch of feedback.They've said they now have a clear vision of what they'll build on this foundation, now we'll see how it goes.*The game is WORTH the $15 as it is currently, as updates continue to roll out it'll be worth the usual $30 indie game price."

I'll refrain fromspeculation here on what / who / how, but there has been complete radio silencefrom the devs for quite a while, and my gut feeling says this project might be deadat this point.-----original review below-----Just launched on EA and still in early alpha stage, I wouldn't recommend it for a general audience yet as there is only a limited set of the features to come implemented. It currently features a small portion of the ships/weapons/modules that will be available, two skirmish battle missions you can play on four maps, and ship customization designer.Having said that, it has huge potential and is on track to become the definite must-have spacefleet battle simulator game of 2016. Sitting kinda in-between the strategic elements of Homeworld and the tactical focus of Nexus, it is a nice breath of fresh air for the genre."
