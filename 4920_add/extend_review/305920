76561197989132185,Recommended,305920,11611982,"Posted: 9 August, 2014",all,pulp-reduced,"Another Perspective starts out as an innocuous indie-platformer, like so many others. Only the intriguing part is this parallax view that is the gameplay, where you view an object from two - or a multitude - of different perspectives and the object, in this case the level, changes its appearance. The gameplay itself is reminiscent of how some of the levels of The Swapper plays out, in the interplay of the “clones” or in this case just arbitrary copies or resized models of the same Braid look-alike character that we, the player, are in control of.You get the feeling of Another Perspective's metanarrative quite early on in the game. Where the narrator seems aware that this game is, in fact, a game. The player is set out to find the objet petit a or the “unattainable object of desire.” The same object that later turns out to be something completely different.We have many metanarrative games these days, games that poke fun at the derived nature of most game genres. It happens so often that these metanarrative games become this type of derived, iterative, easy way out for delevopers that lack “real” creativity in their storytelling. I struggle to figure out if this game is one of those games, or not. To break the parallax here I would say it's somewhere inbetween. It, almost, seems like the metanarrative in Another Perspective manifested itself qua lack of ideas. But in that process, what actually manifested itself turned out to be rather enjoyable, albeit mildly mawkish, but to be honest I've never felt as appreciated for playing a game, so I'm okay with the overly sentimental parts of this game. I was smiling during some portions of the game, due to its narrative, or to this self-aware developer/player interaction commenter guy.And on the subject of derivation, this game borrows its tone heavily from Braid. Not the melodies themselves, but the undertone, the brooding, surreal hum of the strings that plays throughout the game reminds me of the same undertone in Braids OST. The character animation is also something that, along with games like The Bridge, seems to be a not as iconic ersatz of the character in Braid. But that's something ubiquitous in the indie-2D-platformer-scene.The general artstyle is rather simplistic, almost minimalistic, not to the level of Thomas Was Alone, but still very simple. This gives the player all their time to focus on the puzzles themselves. And in a metanarrative, the gameplay surely suffers(?), as in the case of Spec Ops: The Line and The Stanley Parable? Not in this case. The puzzles in Another Perspective range from simplistic, puzzles that are there to make the player happy (KEYS!!!), and mind-bogglingly complex puzzles that turns into a gradual understanding of the complete picture. As in The Swapper, and as mentioned before, the copies' interactions is what the majority of the puzzles are based upon, but in a deeper sense than what The Swapper provides, since in that game these are only one of multiple different ways these clones interact and solve puzzles. Here the focus is on different types of perspective and the interplay between these perspectives and entities. The way you had to think between different screens and positions really made the game's more complex puzzles very satisfying to figure out. And despite the narrative being self-obsessed it managed to, rather creatively, explain the games mechanics to you.The narrative, narrator, commentator, the supposed player thoughts, does at one point in the game break down, due to the meaningless of it all, and pleads the game to stop, the player to stop, just for this madness to end. At this point I wondered if this was supposed to mirror the player's thought on a game where there is no discernible goal, or meaning. What that did instead was to bring down my overall thoughts on the narrative, the text on the screen, the conversations, that even though it's a short game, it starts repeating itself in a slightly annoying fashion. But at just that point of annoyance, it switches things up and the end draws closer, relieving not the player of meaninglessness, but the narratives' inertia.Another Perspective is a short, cheap game, and it's worth your time. It's clever at points, in both level design and narrative, and even though there is no real outstanding visual or auditory style to the game, it has enough style, to not make it completely bland. As mentioned before, I've never felt so appreciated for playing a game. And just for that, I feel this game is worth something. Its humility despite its skeptical narration is admirable, and the final moments of the game are fairly cute and lovable, depending on how cynical and bitter you feel that day. I would give this a shot if I were you."

Another Perspective is a really amazing game and it resonated with me a lot. The puzzles are challenging, but not to the point where it's frustrating and the story is what you make of it. It's captivating and for me, this is the best puzzle based indie game that I've played in a long time. Though short, this really is worth every single cent and more. Seriously, really good game. Really good. So good."
,Recommended,305920,15313756,"Posted: 11 April, 2015",all,Dreamer Alone,"This is quite a charming game. I've known the developer's work for a while but I didn't imagine he would use such a basic concept to make a puzzle game. Besides movement you just switch characters and needs keys, however level design teaches you to use that in several different ways that from your perspective you wouldn't imagine being done.If you like puzzles, this is a must have. Also, the game has the annoying habit of making you care a lot for the characters, and it leaves you wanting to see more of them, although the game stops in the right moment. Worth buying at full price.PS: If you like this kind of game, but wants something more quickly paced, I suggest you play Pause Ahead."

Probably. Would I recommend it? If you're into Philosophy of Mind, decidedly. If you're not, and enjoy puzzle-platformers, this is okay but I doubt it would scratch a major itch."
,Recommended,305920,11616107,"Posted: 9 August, 2014",all,CXZman,"Another perspective stands as a really good puzzle platformer game. Interesting gameplay, slick, maybe a bit too short (though there is a whole lot of harder challenge to go through if you finish the game as quickly as I did).They tried to achieve some mystery. The trailers actually delivers a good first taste of what to expect ingame.It doesn't really blow through the roof or anything, but it will give you a good challenge.The storytelling is daunting but feels exagerated. The thriller tone kinda doesn't feel right.All in all, a good game for a fair price. It's getting rare.Or is it? Could you trust me on that?It's not the next Braid, but it does a good job itself.Of course not, I recon it is closer to The Bridge but only from the mood perspective."

,Recommended,305920,11610198,"Posted: 8 August, 2014",all,Eluminite,"The artisticness, style, and flow of Braid, with a mechanic similar to The Swapper. It's all combined with just enough special sauce to make the game feel truly unique, all the while conveying a message entirely its own. The challenge and flow of the game are handled extremely well, allowing it to create a sense of tension or triumph exactly when it wants to. Playing Another Perspective is a very well-crafted experience, which just makes you appreciate its message that much more.I've had more fun with other puzzle platformers, but few have managed to so perfectly balance how much I was thinking about the puzzles with thinking about the big picture of the game (and there was plenty of both!). It's a fairly short game- my first runthrough took just over an hour, but if you're at all a fan of puzzle platformers, this is not one to miss."

I bought this game, beacause i just wanted to play an indie game. I don't know. I just felt like it.Okay. This is a puzzle and a platformer (as meant in the tags ;)) so you have to jump and to switch on your brain.I never played a game like this and i think this is the first one with such a method. You easily 'switch' into 'yourself' to reach different places and handle otherway."
,Recommended,305920,12291077,"Posted: 29 September, 2014",all,MaybeJustice,"Another Perspective is quite an interesting game to say the least. There isn't really a story. The game more or less tries teach the player about a way of thinking, which explains the title. ""So... The title is a spoiler?"" you'd might ask. ""Exactly."" would be my reply, but the game tells it in quite an intriguing way,  a way I personally didn't see coming. It takes, the whole there's someone else who sais and thinks diffirent thing, what you've seen in the trailers and takes it few steps further. This, in turn, gives the story a little more weight to it, and, in my books, makes it a little bit better. The game really tries to make you think, but after a while it will be a little more brunt with its message, and you will notice that. That's quite the shame though, because at one point it really was making me ponder and this just made me lose the immersion it created.Now for the mechanics and design.Lets start with the art design:The art design is pretty good. The levels look boring, just brown and grey brown. The character though, that's what I really liked. The drawing style was just a breath a fresh air for me, since I've gotten used to the standard triple A level of charachter creation.Next up, the mechanics:The mechanics are fine, great even. Mechanics are introduced and reused. The mechanics are varied and work as they should. And there's one more thing, a very big and important thing. Gameplay work together with the ""story"". Seriously, this game does things better than most triple A's out there.And lastly, design:The levels are good enough. For me at least. I haven't got that much experience with puzzle platformers so I was surprised at the difficulty of this game. Other won't have this problem, because they have superbrains or something. The difficulty ramps up to almost at the end, but it never overstays it welcom by presenting levels that look very much alike over and over again. It is really short because of this, which is a shame, but I can't hate it for that little flaw.In conclusion. Some people might like it for the message, some for the mechanics and some for the challenge. In my opinion is the design not something which will hold it up, but it did help me in the decision making.I hope you do buy this lovely little game and have fun."

There are only a few difficult levels, including one that actually requires taking advantage of a 'glitch' in the game mechanics, showing some extra creativity on the designer's part.The Steam achievements are appropriate and keep the player looking for a few rewarding easter eggs within the game.
