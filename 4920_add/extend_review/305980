,Recommended,305980,11838559,"Posted: 23 August, 2014",all,Vic=HKC=,"I can understand the negative reviews. People are used to FPS with a free movement, more weapons and more gameplay. I can also understand that you can get bored with the repetitve scenes. And well, it's true that in the easy mode, you have often sunlight in the eyes and being blind to any enemies. True, the fact that the controller can't be set for player 1 is also annoying as the default keys for the keyboard aren't natural at all for me (AZERTY keyboard...). However, I don't understand the ""outdated graphics"". Seriously, you don't need CoD graphic quality to enjoy a war FPS! Graphics are good in my opinion.And besides, the gameplay is nervous. Once you progress in the game, you can see more enemies at the screen. And when the Veteran mode is unlocked, some stuf change. Like the fact that the enemy is quicker to hurt you. I'm not used to rail shooter, I prefer ""normal FPS"" but it doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy it.And for the controller thing? Developers will fix that in the next update (well normally).Anyway, anyone is entitled to its opinion. I enjoyed this game. It's not the Game of the Year. Sure, if you're a lover of great graphics (à la CoD), you'll be disappointed. But I don't think that graphics make a game. Everything is coherent in the game, apart dates. I totally recommend it, not because I'm in love with this game, but mainly because it's still fun to beat high scores..."
76561197999126698,Recommended,305980,11891556,"Posted: 27 August, 2014",all,NATO 5.56,"Summary: Don't let the low price fool you, this game is ok; I'd give it a B-. If you ever want a break from the usual modern FPS format, this is an option that's just as entertaining, but in its own way. This game challenges the player; not always fairly, but usually so. The health meter is a welcome change from being able to recharge health by waiting under cover. Your weapons will sound a bit silly, but they get the job done. This is a game with a realistic setting, non-stop action (except for the shooting ranges) and despite its low price, it's visuals are as breathtaking as any modern game.First, let's talk about the choice of genre: the rail shooter. It's an older style, but age in itself doesn't determine quality. We live in a time where first person shooters are legion, and most operate very similarly. If you ever want a break from that, one option is to try an older style. Would it be more exciting in an arcade cabinet? Yes, and if you tried playing this with an Xbox controller you would have a horrible experience. But as you get past the middle of the game, it gets tough, and if you want to beat the game, you couldn't do it in an arcade cabinet. A mouse and keyboard are the best way to go for this. If you spray and pray in this game, you will get hit even if you kill the enemy. But if you take advantage of the precision a mouse provides, you can get out from cover and have a fair chance of killing him without taking a hit. The difficulty may shock and tick you off if you're used to games where you can press a button to stick to cover and shoot at your enemy without exposing yourself, which is no challenge at all. In my opinion, a quality shooter of any kind is one where you have to make your own cover and get out from behind it to engage an enemy, and this game fills that requirement.And yes, I said difficulty. Some reviewers claim that this game is as easy as Whack-A-Mole. Maybe they're the god-like, all-day snipers of Counter-Strike and Day of Defeat who cause normal mortals like me to stop playing those games out of having no chance of scoring a point. Maybe they only played the console version. Or maybe they only played the first level on normal mode, because the further I get through this game, the more that claim confuses me. The enemy can shoot back, and sometimes there will be little to no pause between the shots of one enemy and the next, making it almost impossible to break cover and shoot back without getting hit. It makes the grenades like precious gems, because they're the best way to clear enemies that won't hardly let you stick your head up. This game does challenge the player; not always fairly, but usually so. Then there are levels where you get in an Abrams tank or an Apache attack helicopter, where the enemy can't do an opium-picking thing to you, and the main challenge then is hitting everything and doing it fast, because you're always on the move.Then there's the realism factor. Criticisms are: shoot an enemy anywhere and he dies, we're back to health meters and health packs, and the guns are just plain silly. To be fair, the rifles and pistol certainly are silly, and there's no good reason to spend an upgrade point on a new rifle, because nothing changes. Save it for extra ammo, health, grenades and faster reload time. The guns look highly detailed, but the player's small arms sound like Robotron fighting Megaman in the middle of a disco. The guns of your allies and enemies sound much better, and so do weapons mounted on vehicles. As for health meters and single shot kills, a health meter and health packs are much more realistic than many shooters where you just have to crawl under a rock and wait five seconds for all your wounds to heal, and single hit kills are more realistic than needing to put two rounds into a target's head or five into his chest. Think of the ArmA games: no mercy from bullets. I welcome the health meter back with open arms.Now for the story. The problems that you can't escape from are the sloppy syntax and prose in this game, mainly in the journal entries before the missions. If you're thinking ""This doesn't sound anything like a Marine, or any English speaker"", then that's because this game was made by Teyon, a Polish video game developer. This is not the first game to have translation problems, but they could have done better on the journal entries (although the radio chatter in mid-battle sounds authentic). There are some other inaccuracies: the uniforms are Army uniforms and not Marine uniforms, and the Marines do not use the Black Hawk or the Chinook. As for the content, it doesn't deserve the hate that it gets from the politically correct about being a game in a real setting like Operation Enduring Freedom. Nobody has a problem with all the games set in the Second World War, where just about every side can be played as. Spec Ops: The Line, where your main enemies are American soldiers, has gotten a pass, so there's no ground to stand on when ridiculing this game for being from a modern American soldier's point of view. If you ask me, gamers could do with a healthy, even if unpleasant, dose of reality in their lives. Instead of trying to make some idiotic moral equivalence between the US and its foes, this game is based on authentic characters. The Marines are experts and professionals, who pull out all the stops to complete their mission with as few casualties as possible. The game punishes the player for friendly fire and civilian casualties, as it should if it wants to be taken seriously. The game doesn't name the enemy, it calls them “rebels”, but if you don't know who they really are, you must be living under a rock. They are portrayed accurately as well: they wear civilian clothes, take civilians hostage and hide behind them, and know no limits as to where they will fight from. Although the places and times of the battles aren't exact representations of real life, the concepts are real enough: combined arms battles in environments like mountains, small villages, big cities, and military bases. If you want something more varied and fantastic, then play Mass Effect or something.Finally, I believe the game's greatest strength is in its visuals. They stand with the best of modern games. You could only get a better picture of the Afghan combat environment from a TV camera or actually visiting it. Every pocket of a uniform, every feature of a vehicle or weapon, and every contour of a building is superb. You have to deal with the very real problem of natural and artificial light in a battle, meaning it gets in your eyes. In an age where graphics are as advanced as they are, it might not seem like such a big deal that the game has excellent visuals, but how about when it has them and is selling for $5 on Steam? Now that's a cut apart, isn't it?In the end, while it may not be my favorite game of all time, it was still a worthwhile purchase that I recommend."

76561197971341065,Recommended,305980,21403591,"Posted: 23 February, 2016",all,sfnhltb,"A decent rail shooter with a reasonable storyline and good gameplay, although a bit on the easy side once you have the hang of the cover system and how to use it. There is a reasonable variety in the missions, in the open, villages, tunnels/caves, on a helicopter, in a tank, etc. so it doesn't become too repetitive.The difficult ramps up reasonably well through the game, with an initial easy mode that unlocks a veterans campaign which is reasonably tough although it can be a bit checkpoint dependant - if you miss a health pack just before a checkpoint in a couple of places it can make it very difficult to advance without restarting the level. Other than that the checkpoints are fine, avoiding having to replay too much when you die, but not too close together so you have to get at least vaguely competent to advance (in VM at least).The story is functional but fairly forgettable and generic, the on rails gameplay works fine here for me - you act reasonable sensibly, always having cover available (although it isn't usually 100% so you have to pick off a couple of enemies while in cover before you can reload and take on the rest of the scene one by one. You are a bit of a bullet sponge (especially once you have progressed and got the bonus health) but not to the point of immersion breaking - you do feel vulnerable to enemies, especially heavy machine guns and the like.There are a few weak points though - repeatedly taking on BTRs with small arms (Technicals, sure), whereas at the opposite side of the scale a certain enemy that takes 10+ direct hits from a bazooka to kill seems unlikely. There are also quite a lot of quick time events where you are nearly crushed to death by a falling object or whatever, but following the instruction is optional - you dodge anyway, you just get extra points (and say ""Hoo-ah!""). This leads onto the sound more generally - which is competent, but cliched and repetitive.Overall this is a decent but fairly forgettable addition to the genre, recommended if you like this sort of ""Time Crisis"" gameplay, especially given it is not exactly expensive to pick up even when not on sale."
,Recommended,305980,16962643,"Posted: 9 July, 2015",all,Two Clicks,"VERDICT:Heavy Fire: Afghanistan is a well polished, if short, rail-shooter with cover mechanics, unlockable weapons and equipment, and quick-time events.Full of quick-moving, adrenaline pumping firefights that occur in numerous fixed locations keeping you on your toes and forces you to take cover, acquire where targets are located, before shooting or blowing them up!  Limited ammo and explosives mean you are always looking to replinish your ever decreasing resources as the sequence of fights never let up until you complete the mission.Between missions you can update your equipment and weapons with up to twelve unlocks suchs as better weapons, larger ammo capacity or more grenades.  The enemy A.I. is competant enough to provide a challenge especially on Veteran difficulty.There isnt much of a learning curve and it doesnt last very long but in the few hours that you begin and end your mission you will get to experience a lot of fast paced and explosive action.   Being a relatively cheap game it punches above its weight..., I mean cost!It best feature is the way it keep the action moving forwards towards a conclusion just like a good novel.  Together with the excellent graphics, atmospheric sound and easy to use controls you get a great feeling of immersion.  It worst feature... well apart from its shortness.... Has to be the awful voice-overs during the mission de-brief... argh!! :)Will appeal to fans of the genre, achievement hunters or anyone who likes a cheap game.  If you dont like linear gameplay then avoid.  Personally I loved playing through it twice.... MORE DETAILS BELOW ...01. GENRE:FPS Military themed, Rail Shooter w/ QTE02. SETTING:Modern Day, Afghanistan War03. STORY/BACKGROUND:You play the role of a soldier in a unit of the United States Army.  You are currently based in Afghanistan fighting a fictional skirmishes against insurgents.04. GAME MODES:Fourteen mission single-player campaign played in two difficulty settings - Rookie and Veteran modes, one after each other.  Play mostly as (grunt) foot soldier, with a very few missions as a gunner in armored vehicle or tank or helicopter.  These do a nice job of shaking up the action somewhat.05. GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS:Game mechanics couldn't be much simpler.  A series of linear firefights that take place in predetermined locations interspersed by sections of fluid automated movement linking each  location.  At each location enemies appear and try to shoot at you.  You in turn shoot/lob grenades, reload, get into cover.  Rinse and repeat.  Cover sometimes provides two or more options in the direction you choose.  This is something of a tactical decision as part of the screen remains open to enemy shooters so you may find you have to change cover position to remain safe.  Intersperced throughout every mission are a number of Quick-time events, introduced to shaken up the regular rhythm of gameplay specifically to keep you on your toes throughout the firefights.Visual threats are indicated on screen so you can determine which enemy soldier is the biggest threat at a particular moment in the mission.  While additional audio indicators are used to indicated danger from heavy weapons.  Environmental elements such as smoke and sunlight are used to good effect to blind you from possible enemies lurking at a location.  While also adding an additional element of immersion to gameplay.  In addition the constant moving,  swaying, and ever changing line-of-sight, means you never quite have the time and occasion to take a perfect shot.  While the ever constantly changing camera angle greatly enhances the real threat of friendly fire taking place towards other members of your unit.Difficultly is implemented though a combination of factors the speed at which enemies appear and shoot, enemy numbers and a reduction inresource replenhishments.  As you progress through each mission there are numerous resource refil icons to replenish ammo, health and grenades.  But you have to be quick.  If you miss them you must do without until the mission is completed.There is an Armory screen that shows twelve unlockable weapons and equipment upgrades that makes the game easier and more fun to play.There is a ranking system that promotes you as you progress through the campaign twice; first on novice difficulty, followed by veteran mode.  This makes for a good learning curve as the harder difficult provides a decent challenge.  Completing missions gives points that total up towards a Ranking level.  The greater the combied scores the higher the rank.  The higher the rank the better the player.06. ENEMIES:Muhjahadeen and insurgents armed with AK-47s and RPGs.  Some heavy machineguns and rocket launchers mounted on pickup trucks, BTR armoured transports, and Hind helicopters.07. LEVEL DESIGN:Short, immersive levels. Uses a terrific range of locations so that you are never bored of the surroundings you find yourself in.  Camera sway and movement adds an extra dimension so you never quite feel in control of the situation.  Otherwise the threats are limited to mainly enemy soldiers and a number of heavy weapons or armored vehicles and helicopters make an appearance like end of level bosses.08. A.I:Robust if somewhat basic.  Then again this genre really doesnt need anything other than an A.I. that provides enough of a challenge for whoever is playing the game.09. CONTROLS:Excellent mouse and keyboard functions.  Especially pertinent is the mouse sensitivity options.  You may need this if you're mouse moves like a lead ballon as there is no light-gun for PC... :(  Whats a light-gun?  ^^10. GRAPHICS:Great.  Very colourful and adds to the immersion.11. SOUNDTRACK & AUDIO:Basic.  A single catchy soundtrack that eggs you forwards.  Some decent weapons sounds, shouts, screams, radio chatter and background explosions add to the immersion.12. VOICE ACTING:Not a big fan of the voice-overs in this game.  Felt like the voice actors were sub-par but thankly their use is limited only to the mission debriefs.13. CHALLENGE/DIFFICULTY:A breeze on Novice difficulty.  Actually challenging in places on Veteran difficulty.  The save checkpoints and environmental features add to the difficulty in veteran mode.14. PROBLEMS:No problems were encountered installing, running or playing this game.15. ACHIEVEMENTS:A good mix of achievements.  Mostly standard achieve x kills.  Complete mission y, etc... All easily obtainable by plaing through the campaign in Novice and  Veteran difficulty modes.  There are a few combo related achievements that may require a replay of a level or two.16. DLC:None.17. PLAYTIME:From five to ten hours to play the same campaign twice.18. LONGEVITY/REPLAYABILITY:Fans of the genre who dont mind replaying the same campaign can do so to better their score.  If you're an achievement hunter then you will play through the campaign twice and most likely complete all but one achievement during those playthroughs.19. ENJOYMENT/APPEAL:If you are fan of this genre or are too lazy to play a bon-a-fide FPS then this could be something you should consider.   Especially if you have a preference for modern day military themes set around the recent wars against religious fundamentalism.20. VALUE FOR MONEY:Perfect value for money.  If only it was a little longer.  A steal on sale.  An easy recommendation."

It is similar in quality to the Rambo on-rails shooter video game that came out some time ago.  Dialogue is clunky, the story isn't engaging, aiming and the ""feel"" of the guns is off.  It probably doesn't help that I played a much better on-rails shooter (Blue Estate), but this game is a harsh step backwards.The only saving gracy(?) is that it is cheap."

True it would be a little bit easier to have a light-gun but mouse works and that's all that counts. The enviornment is destructable, the enemies come in swarms and the upgrades actually do something. It's short, to the point, and does not attempt to try to cover it's a rail arcade shooter, and that's what I love about it.Remember as a child when you'd go to an arcade to play ""The House of the Dead?"" or ""AREA 51 Site 4?"" or the ""AREA 51/Maximum Force"" duo? When your only care was not that you couldn't hear the volume or how handguns ejected rifle cartridges, you only had one focus, where the targets are going to come from next.Well remember no more. Heavy Fire: Afghanistan takes you back to that place when power ups, med kits, and sometimes ammunition mattered in gaming. When a cover system was a cover system and not a decorative piece. This is a place where you only have one focus, to look for the next threat, and not that exclusive worthless pre-order power up.Shoot your way through the ranks and waves of enemies and unlock your upgrades. Although only twelve levels, the replayability is how many waves you want to shoot through. Load up and power up your way through the field."

I've seen some horrible♥♥♥♥♥♥in my life, as some other state i've played Ride to Hell: Retribution, Rambo the videogame, The Slaughtering Grounds and The walking dead: survival instinct and even when those titles suck, i've enjoy them, but this game it's a total pile a garbage. This game it's like the product of a hobo and dump cannister having a child's puke, a dog eating that puke and the♥♥♥♥♥♥comming out of the dog it's this game, everything about it is just horrible, when i've got the game (for 2.99) didn't really think that i could see with my own eyes how Teyon (btw the developer of Rambo the videogame) could really make such masterpiece of the art of completly sucking balls. I could go on and on for hours with the totally complete wrong things it makes this game so horrible, and i will.Graphics: They are pretty much OK for a 2010/11 game, not really sensation but somehow not that bad, thought there are really annoying things like getting blinded by the sun (i could't see the enemies so i just shoot blindly straight forward until they die, and this happends a lot)Sound: The worst thing without a doubt, voice actors were paid like 5 bucks each and they did that, make a voiceover for characters worth 5 bucks, aside from that gunfire sounds is horrible, i've played so many games that have guns in it and never heard such horrible gunshots sounds.Gameplay: Reasonable. just one word for it, it's not good but it's not really that bad EXCEPT FOR THE MOUSE HAVING NO SENSIVILITY AND WORKING HORRIBLY LIKE IF YOUR DPI WERE 50.Metascore: 0.63/100 - this game isn't even got to scratch 1 point, maybe the price is the only thing right about it."

In a normal FPS, I chose to go left, right, back, etc.  In this game, the game does it for you and I find it very disorienting.  I can't anticipate the movement and find myself getting dizzy.  Also, I have to unplug my logitech F710 and my Nostromo n52 because the game detects them as controllers and wants player two and three to play.  This is an example of a console port that has not been thought through because many people use keypads instead of the keyboard but this game will not allow it.  Steam really need to enact a 24 hour satisfaction garantee or you money back.  I just wasted 4,49 $.  Oh well.(By the way, I knew it was a rail shooter, I just did not anticipate the effect it would have on me. For some people, this would not be an issue, it was for me.)"

If you're unsure as to what this means, it's a bit like those ""House of the Dead"" arcade machines (or ""Time Crisis""), where you don't really control where your character - the only movement you have is to duck into cover.  If you're expecting Call of Duty or Battlefield, you'll be disappointed.It's actually not too bad a game.  The animation and graphics are pretty good (even if the effects for explosions are crap) and the makers have made a decent effort in this area.  Voice acting is fair too.The cover system in the game is pretty reasonable - not all cover provides total protection from the bad guys.  You may be hidden from most of the enemies, but there may still be one or two that can hit you.It's not an awful game.  But it could be better.As I said before, the explosions are rather disappointing - they don't look realistic at all (and no I'm not expecting huge fireballs from grenades).  A little more effort here would make the game a bit more realistic.You do tend to rely on shooting first-aid kits (for health) and ammo crates (for ammunition) but these are sometime rather difficult to see when half a dozen enemies are shooting at you.  (Ctd...)There are a few parts of the game where you reach a checkpoint with low health, and then get killed shortly afterwards.  You have the option to re-start from the checkpoint, but this is with the same level of low health, which then makes it tough to progress from there onwards.  In that respect there are bits of the game where you end up re-starting the entire level, and it gets frustrating.There are also a number of quick-time events (where a key will flash up on the screen and you have to press it quickly) that initiate a particular movement (dodging falling rubble for example).  However, I didn't really feel that they added that much to the game, or even that they were very important.When balancing all this though, you have to remember - it's only £3.99 at its regular price.  You could put that much into an arcade game and get about ten minutes of fun.  So for less than £4 you're getting a decent full game, but bear in mind that it's not a big-budget title, and adjust your expectations accordingly.Incidentally, some reviews and discussions mention problems with getting the game to run and/or stability (ie crashes) but I had no problems at all in this respect.I'd give it six or seven out of ten."

It would have been nice to have a light gun to play with, and the controls take some time to get used to, but the game delivers what it promises. Take the time to get to know the controls and the game becomes fun to play.I confess that the controls had me confused from time to time, but then you play the section over till you get it done. :)"

(I think the PS3 version has one). But even then, it just isn't fun. Also, the voice-acting and gunfire is poor. Many on-rails games are much better than this, even VirtuaCop 2 from 1995!Don't be fooled, there is a place for on-rails games like this. That's why more effort should have been put in."
