Let's start with the cons as there is very little of them.Cons:-Save game has a nasty habit of corrupting or completely disappearing.-The same repetitive jingle being playing all the time in game.-The difference in difficultly between easy>medium>hard>impoppible can be rather steep.Pros:-Addicting to play (lost my game save 3 times but still went back and played it).-Easy enough to pick up and play for 5 minutes (in my case it was a 2 hour lecture in uni).-Can be played with keyboard and/or mouse.-It is a very fun game to do co-op in.-No microtransactions to be found.-Plays great even on battery saving mode with everything turned off or low.Final rating: I'd give this a 4.5/5 due to me having my save game wiped 3 times...I'd recommend picking this up on a sale sometime. Although, I'd personally say that it is indeed worth the full price although I picked it up on a sale."

Beautiful visuals now in HD as well. Runs incredibly smoothly even at laggy levels, perfect performance. I see a lot of people say there is no windowed mode, but there actually is now, in settings. And no browser errors nor java crashes, and in browser you would easily go slow when running this in another tab, now it doesn't. Great game, new updates every now and then. I'd say 10/10."

76561198263427469,Recommended,306020,35024199,Posted: 17 September,all,Rurik,"Probably this game is the best Tower Defence game for casual players. But strategic players will find this game extremely boring and repetitive.The rules are simple. You have an army of monkeys (21 tower) with different abilities which stands against.... balloons. Seems funny. Looks pretty funny. Sometimes I have feelings it was designed for children, because graphics is so.. childish, but then I remembered what the gameplay is incredibly simple too, so the graphics and the gameplay perfectly fit.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1137361368Let's go back to the gameplay. There are different colour of balloons. For example, red ballon can be popped with 1 hit. Blue releases red balloon if it was pierced, green releases blue and etc. There are also metal balloons, camouflage ballons, anti-freeze, boss and etc.So this game ballons and monkeys. Place monkeys, pop balloons, buy stronger monkey with bigger weapons. And it's pretty funny until you realise that all maps has the same filling of waves. I mean 15th wave of any map has the same amount and order of ballons as all other maps. Incredible. Have you ever seen a TD game with this awesome feature? Congrats, there is a one.This ""feature"" makes the game boring after you passed one of levels. But... suddenly.. I have found that casual players like it. There is a guy with 750h+ in this game. Can you imagine, he played a thousands of times at the same missions (yeah, there are 5 difficulties, which has 15-20 to wave count), passed the same levels with same ballons. Incredible. Actually, this is the main reason why I gave this game a positive review, because a lot of players could like this game. Thank to god, I am not one of them :Dhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1137361457Pros- 21 tower with different speciality. I liked the upgrade system for towers. Each tower has 2 paths and 4 upgrades in each path. You can take both 2 levels in each path, but after you need to choose a path for 3 and 4 tier upgrades. Also, upgrades are interesting. Some of them are simple (more range, more attack speed) and slightly change visual (blue hat becomes red), but other significantly changes visual of tower and gives huge bonuses. For example, there is a Monkey Buccaneer. You can upgrade it to Battlecruiser with tier 3 upgrade and to aircraft carrier with 4 tier upgrade. So, there are actually much more than 21 towers. Meanwhile, a lot of them are useless :D- A lot of maps, more than 40. Each has interesting visual and changes a path. There are 5 difficulties and some other modes like Co-op or Odyssey and etc.- A lot of other stuff. There are upgrade system for tokens, rank system for exp, shop stuff for cash. There is a daily rewards with daily quests and etc, achievements and etc.. Hello from free-to-play past. (game doesn't require any in-purchases)- No text, no preview, no tutorials. You ll go into the battle on your own. But it's easy to understand, so it's plusCons- Same wave filling and order.- You need to play/grind a lot to open all towers upgrades- You can lose suddenly. I mean, you play, defended 40 weeks with no leaks, you play of course on 2x speed. When something happens and you lose in 5 seconds. It is really frustrating- Even the first level has 50 waves at least. Actually, all maps has 50 waves at least, so is the first. I preferred that the time of first map was less- Games crashes. I have got 2 game crashes during 3 hours of gameplay. Anyway, there is autosaves, so this is not big deal.- I have seen a lot of recent negative reviews where people complained about lost progress. I have seen no replies, so I suppose, debs don't care much about their players- Annoying and repetitive musichttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1137361512So, If you are searching for an interesting TD game with deep strategy, different levels, unique enemies   - don't buy it, I can't recommend this game for you even for 1 dollar.But if you play TD games because you like watching how your towers kill enemies or because TD games relax you - this is the game for you. There are 200h of watching how balloons pop, I suppose,"

The mechanics are simple enough so that everyone can understand them easily and yet they provide some very deep gameplay! The aesthetics are great and just very pleasant to look at! The game has many levels and challenges and even if you beat them all you can set new goals! For example: Can I beat this mission without this tower. I am a fan of the BTD series since the first game and each one has a lot of new things to offer and especially this one. Also don't think that because there is a browser free version this one is not worth it. It is much better. There is one con:There is no chat in the co-op mode!

,Recommended,306020,23978557,"Posted: 1 July, 2016",all,八六,"I have a little bit of time on this game and I think I'm ready to write my first review ever.I'm going to compare this game to the In-Browser version for you to determine if it is worth the $5 it is on sale.Pro's of Steam Game1. Very Fluid and there will be little to no lag ever. For me, lag usually started around round 60 In-Browser, in this version, it does not start occuring to maybe the 100+ levels, and that is with plenty of towers out and darts flying everywhere.2. More Turrets to add some more variety. These include Engineer, Helicopter, Shredder. The helicopter is my personal favorite and these new turrets add some new dynamics to work with.3. There are maps after maps after maps. I mean just maps galore. It will be awhile before you finish all of them on all difficulties.4. Monkey Cash just flows in while playing the Steam version. It seems as though you always have cash handy which allows you to actually buy the agents without thinking that you are wasting money and that you would actually have to spend real money to do microtransactions.Now  there is a negative that occurs in this game though, which all surrounds the Co-op.1. There is no chat. Like none. You cannot communicate with your teamates on Co-op and it is really hard to do hard levels without this, which will make you just have to play them with a friend you have and just hop in a Discord call or something.2. There are glitches that occur with Co-op all the time. You can usually play one game through with a friend, but lets say that you fail and want to retry, 9/10 times, it will glitch up and your friend will never join the next match. So you have to leave and make a new lobby and re-invite. Not horrible, it just gets really annoying after a while. Also, if you go into a quickmatch, expect 50% of the time, you will get disconnected from your team mate.3. Invisible Bloons. While playing with my friend, I have noticed that sometimes i will be able to see some bloons and my parter won't. This has cost us countless matches because he legitimately can't see the bloons that I can.4. Banana glitch. In Co-op, if your friend puts down a banana farm, the bananas will pop up on your screen as well. They have no impact to you and they don't give anyone money, but they will still pop up on your screen. The only way to have a temporary fix is to have your friend put down the banana farmer agent. He will keep the bananas off your screen.Overall I really like this game. Co-op can be a little bit of a hassle and annoying; however, if you can get a game going with a friend, it can be very enjoyable. I would rate this game a 8/10 with the 2 off being Co-op."

If you were thinking this is anything like that then you are wrong. The game has inhanced graphics, better mechanics, (mortar tower isn't annoying to upgrade anymore) new towers, an assortment of new gamemodes, and no premium shop. (kinda) The new towers are fun and easier to figure out and understand (besides the helicopter) for example the bloon chipper, sucks in bloons and cuts layers off. The helicopter though, I don't get it. Maybe it's because I don't use it since I have strategies with the old ones or that it's complicated but I never see it being used. Here's a list of pros and cons though.Pros- Easy to understand interface and nothing is ever cut off or hidden.- Shortcut keys in this feel super useful versus never needing them on the flash version- Impoppable gamemode is impoppably hard, it's a good thing!- New towers are fun and easy to work into any endgame strategy- Enhanced graphics are beautiful and work with the maps- Charming art style- Lots of replay ability- Premium shop doesn't let you ""pay to win"", it should really just be called the shopCons- Helicopter tower may be bugged, may be useless, idk- The game gets very monotonous very fast- Daily challenge on impoppable difficulty can be impossible, either towers cost to much and it can't reach an area orsomething else along those lines can happen.- You can't cross a Ninja Kiwi account with this one so you must restart- Ranking up is very slow once you hit like 25Over all it's a pretty good game with a lot of things going for it. 8/10 would recommend to everyoneAlso if anyone could tell me how to use the helicopter that would be much appreciated"

However, for this game, it doesn't seem necessary.Bloons TD 5 is a great sequel, almost surpassing its predecessors in many ways. The addition of different game modes like the Boss Battles and Conquests add a small layer of variety to a fairly repetitive game. I look at Bloons as a time killer kind of game where you can sit back, throw a Netflix show on the other monitor or your phone, and play. Some of the later levels at higher difficulties will require some careful money spending and strategizing, but it's sill a relatively simple game.If you enjoyed any of the earlier Bloons games, then I highly recommend dropping the money to support the devs while having a good time killer on your hands!"

Has new special missions and runs at full HD, something never before in a BTD game, except Deluxe.This is Ninja Kiwi's finest game, I've always said, instead of a releasing a game for free and putting microtranscations in it, you pay up front, and get everything, and my god has it worked.This is better than Monkey City by far, and I hope Monkey City gets a paid for version as well at some point.The only complaint I have about this game is that it doesn't have all of the new Monkey City tracks, and that it doesn't have Bloons Tower Defense Deluxe's moving tracks, like the floating island track.And it doesn't have all of Deluxe's Premium Upgrades, but thats it.Other than that, it's an incredible game."

The idea of monkeys protecting themselves by eliminating floating, inanimate objects is just the cutest, the design and animation are phenomenal, and the gameplay gets more exciting as you progress. There are a ton of different tracks of different difficulties which are constantly added and come with their own modes so that the game can't be too easy or too difficult for anybody, and the work/reward system is just the right balance. There are also about 170 upgrades you can unlock for each tower that can sport a number of different combinations of abilities thanks to the 2 upgrade paths each one gets.Pros:+ Actively updated+ Good way to pass the time+ Often releases events that allow players to gross mass amounts of currency and other rewards+ Meticulous graphics boasting splendid artwork and soothing music, as well as satisfying popping sound effects+ Many tracks, towers, upgrades, and strategies to choose from+ No absolute need for in-game purchases; you can pretty much unlock everything by playing+ Multiplayer or single-player mode+ Clever ideas in terms of tactics each tower uses+ Easy start-up and open-ended freeplay, as well as a sandbox mode+ Various upgrades from the online version of Bloons TD 5 on the Ninja Kiwi website+ Runs quickly and generally feels very smooth and liquid, or at least on my desktopCons:- Strange and slightly unappealing font motif (but I got used to it)- Disgusting shading and use of color on specific tower designs (which I also got used to playing the mobile version)- Automatic tower actions and popping sounds drown out music in later rounds during gameplay when a lot goes on- Relatively small community, but which is very involved- Gets boring after a while in one sitting (I recommend breaks)- Repetitive gameplay; not much to look forward to once far in- Lacks in-game messaging in co-op mode- Hardly anybody actually cooperates in co-op mode- Some towers are just plain useless; if they were either not there in the first place or were buffed, I'd say otherwiseDespite the cons, they're pretty much my givens for most of the games I play, so my opinion remains a 10/10 with all my heart."

There's even a meth lab where you can inject 47th, 48th and probably even 49th chromosomes into your beloved monkey underlings, so that they can do all kinds of unnatural things to your enemies.

,Recommended,306020,18161895,"Posted: 23 September, 2015",all,KBop a doo,"Bloons TD5 is a full release of a popular browser game, Bloons Tower Defense. I hadn't heard of it, but the positive reviews and bright screenshots caught my eye when the price dropped to 75% off in a sale. When I installed the game and started it up, I got a message from no less than three friends stating their love of Bloons. I was also accused of living under a rock since I hadn't heard of it.So, being a simple rock dweller who has not played the browser/flash versions of BTD, I can only give my opinion as a fan of tower defense games.The premise, like most TD games, is simple, something is attacking, and you must defend! In this case, balloons are attacking. Their motives are unknown. Probably they wish to pillage our villages and take advantage of our women. If one slips by you, you lose a life and get that much closer to failing the level.The balloons start out simple - regular red balloons you can pop with one hit. They quickly advance to multi-layered balloons, lead balloons that can only be popped by explosions, camouflaged balloons which must be detected, ceramic balloons, or even balloon blimps that explode into a myriad of other balloons when popped.As you can guess, your defenses must advance as well! Starting from the simple dart thrower, you will advance to bomb towers, ninja monkeys who can see invisible enemies, minigun monkeys, mortar towers, glue guns to slow the horde of incoming balloons, or ships that can pull a whole blimp out of the sky. Every tower can be upgraded as well, and there are two upgrade paths you can choose to pursue. When you take all this into consideration with the fact there are 21 individual tower types, there are a TON of options and strategies.There are also over 40 tracks, 4 difficulties, and the option to play each track in reverse. You can also use the currency you get for beating each track to unlock permanent upgrades to attributes such as attack speed, starting money, popping power, etc. or other bonuses such as Double Cash Mode, and one that increases the range of the Monkey Village (a tower that gives an aura increasing the power of your other towers).My one qualm with the game is, it seems to get a bit too easy once you unlock Double Cash Mode and the Monkey Village range increase. It takes the game from a respectable challenge on normal difficulty, to very easy even on the harder difficulties. But there is still plenty of replay value, and I am still challenged on Impoppable (the hardest difficulty).I also love the visual style, and it runs smoothly even when there are thousands of balloons on my screen. It will start to lag a bit if you get to the higher levels in freeplay mode. I also really appreciate some of the quality of life additions, like the option to automatically run through the levels (ie. skip the pause time in between levels) for experienced players. It's also handy for quick replays of easy missions.I've got 30 hours on Bloons and I'm nowhere near done yet! One of the best $2.50 impulse buys I have made."

It's great for kids and anyone wishing to kill some time while in school or at work. The artstyle is pretty, and watching the bloons get popped is really satisfying and addictive. Most Tower Defense games doesn't achieve this, and I guess that's why Bloons TD is so popular.The bad stuff:The towers and their upgrades are quite cool, but 80% of them are bad. The ""best"" strategy is spamming the same towers over and over again regardless of the map, and this is something you'll realize after just a few hours of playtime. And even worse, there is one tower that amplifies the power of all nearby towers, so placing all your firepower in one tiny area is always your best option, even though a tower would have better map synergy if placed elsewhere. This makes the game extremely repetitive, and sadly, most of this game is about grinding.To unlock the hardest difficulty, you must win 17 of the 19 easiest maps on ALL other difficulties. Yes, you must also complete these beginner tracks on ""easy"" and ""normal"" even though you have already beaten them on ""hard"". This is the level of grinding you can expect if you decide to purchase this game.And finally, you can get passive upgrades that just makes the game way too easy. You can easily boost the firepower of your towers by 20-40% by using tokens that you unlock by - yes, you guessed it - grinding for several hours. You can even unlock ""cheats"" such as double cash which breaks the game, and even while using said cheats you can complete tracks and earn medals as though you didn't use them. So the medal you get for winning a difficult map is pretty much irrelevant, because they can be earnen very easy by activaring various game-breaking bonuses. Comparing your progress with your friends' is therefore irrelevant.Overall, the game is a satisfying-to-play time-killer. But the gameplay is repetitive and grindly, and would be much better as a Free-to-Play. I don't belive it's worth $10."

I use to play this game when it was still on the Ninja Kiwi website and ipad. So I had to buy it for steam of course! The Price is meh but the quality is where it's at. Right now Im working on getting 100% of every single thing in this game. The Newer maps are fun, Coop takes a really long time and is wishing to pick the map that I want to play than the difficulty, and being able to buy the Upgrades that costed money on the ipad version are all things that I feel should be brought up. So I have been really following this game for a while then. Now however the new ""DLC"" stuff I've been seeing is now starting to scare me a little about what they have up their sleeves. What will or wont cost money in the next update. The skins aren't worth your time or money, so just keep that in mind.  But the bottom line is that even though there are a few things the game itself will always be in my heart and I will complete this game too! Im gonna list the few things I love and really hate.What is good!- Making a good Strategy for each map.- Being able to buy things that costed real money in mobile version.- Farming monkey money...- The Random missions teach you things about the different paths I dont take or towers I dont use.- The HD graphics are a step up from the Website and Mobile.- Brings back a ton of memories of me losing my progress 3 times in the mobile version.What is Bad!- Takes time out of my day when you cant speed run mastery challeges- The Coop is a waste of my time when it wont give me the map I want or no one is willing to play the ""difficulty"" that I want to.- Coop can become really laggy, more than when you get higher in the rounds of 100 to 200.- Events are mostly there to give free stuff than things I ACTUALLY want.- These Skins that are paid ""DLC"" that than buying them for a high price of Monkey money- Daily challenge are super painful and I have to waste a lot of money to get a decent one for the achievement.So really it's mostly a even thing of what I hate and Love about this game, I would recommend you turn off that single track of music they play and that poping sound and get your own tunes rolling if you want to play for a while or watch a video or something. It's what I do to past the time as I wait for my completion to come. But in the end I want to see what Ninja Kiwi can do when Bloons 6 comes out, I hope they put there heart and soul into it, because if they want to become greedy with me, than you got a dislike coming your way. The price was one thing, but dont put those in add paid all your money kind of thing in your next game. Really..."

Dont listen to them, $10 is extremely good and its well priced for sure.

Played this game a lot of my phone and BTD Battles on my phone but i didnt like that as much.Proslots of contentGreat varietyConsistent gameplayFun art styleSpecial agentsBest tower defence game ever madeConslittle too easy to unlock everything, there needs to be a way to unlock things by skill not timeNot enough towers (there are 21 non special agents which is alot but i wish there was more)Some towers are not equal. Either they are really good for their cost or really bad, no middleHighlightsSpecialty buildings, these allow you to using the ingame monkey money to unlock a ""land plot"" for a tower, monkey village and the farm do not have one but every non special agent does. These have 4 upgrades, 1st is the unlocking the plot of land (not all same price) which ALWAYS just makes the tower and its upgrades 5% less, also raises by 5% ANOTHER towers cost and upgrades, so in this case a trade off. 2nd will add a bonus, 3rd adds a bonus, and 4th is their better bonus. This is what usually gives a tower its bigger advantage, sadly most specialty buildings are not worth it, actually speaking as somone who has played BTD since BTD2 i can say that these buildings are not worth it. I would say about 5 of them are worth buying, 8 tops.What would make the specialty buildings better would be much more equal advantages compared to others along with EVERY buildings LAST upgrade adding a ANIMATION tweak ingame. As of now only the engineers sentries change shape and color due to the specialty building upgrades. No other tower that i can observe has a physical change.Another highlight is its just amazing idea, bloons in different shapes, colors, types against dart and other material throwing monkeys.

For 10 bucks It is more than worth it to purchase this game, except if you're absolutely burned out from the flash version or already have the mobile version. The only cons that I have for this game is that you simply cannot log 100+ hours unless you really enjoy the content and the harder content is locked based on level and completion so you do have to grind for maps and tower levels."

So I bought it and it was just, amazing. I have a ton of fun playing this game and it's different than the online version because of the better graphics, new towers and other cool stuff.

I have installed, uninstalled, reinstalled, reuninstalled the game and never get bored. I really enjoy the sound of bloons popping, my wife is annoyed with that sound since I played this game soooo much on my phone.The number of tower in this game is just huge, and with the branching speciality of each tower brings different strategy to suit your needs. The dev keep adding content to make players interested. My first love of TD genre is when I played Element TD on Warcraft 3 mod, and after that I have tried countless TD with so few that caught my attention, until I stumble with Bloons TD franchise.

They've got an excellent gameplay formula. The tower diversity as well as upgrades to both the player as well as towers add a lot of flavor to tactical approach, and overall replayability is excellent.That said, there are a couple fundamental flaws to watch out for:-The first and perhaps most crippling is the random crashing that will occur if you're the sort of player that likes to squeese towers into tight spaces at the very border of the 'placeable areas'.(Note to developers: I feel this likely has something to do with the coordinates arrays and warrants some looking in to.)-The second is the net code. In many cases this isn't a very big problem, but on some poor connections to the other player, the client has trouble keeping up with game cash balance updates. There have been times I've had to wait as long as 5-10 minutes on the harder difficulties / longer games while the other player's balance was updated on my screen.Both of these issues can be avoided however, so they should not necessarily sway your decision to get this game.All in all, worth every penny of the $9.99 USD I paid for it.4.5 / 5 *"

I've followed the series pretty close and if I could actually document the time I've invested into the game series..It would exceed 1000 easily. It's a pretty fly expansion into what has already become a successful story.Pros:*Lots of Towers to choose from. Some do better than others, but situations or maps will rise that you'll need to use the ones you don't normally use. A Submarine tower is introduced in this game and it's awesome.*Spy Towers (Going back to the last point) are wonderful. Without spending any bananas (In game currency) and using the money you made on the last map, you can really put a good start on any difficulty. Different ones have different perks, but they are all immensely helpful for any difficulty or map.*You now have the access to making one tower more powerful. Boomerang towers can throw two at one time or Bloon Chippers can stun every bloon that goes through it. It makes the game less dull.*Maps are nicely made and the artwork is fluent. Putting the towers on any map isn't hard.*The Replayability of this game is expansive. Achievement hunting is a thing. Also you now have Special Missions, Daily Challenges, and The Oasis (Which is just a Gauntlet of three/four maps for prizes/cash).*When playing Solo, the game rarely lags.Cons:*One of my main problems with this game is the Co Op and the mechanics. Obviously it wasn't well thought out and let me explain why. You have limited communication, I MEAN you may as well be talking to yourself at this point. The only way to communicate with the other is to press a button that asks for money. So what ends up happening is, you have all these banana farms and your partner is clicking the button repeatedly. Often times, I can't give him any bananas because we're playing on Impoppable (The hardest mode) and I need factories for my side of the map to help me build larger towers. Most people will quit the game mid match and all that time you spent is waisted (either playing by yourself or finding another match for this to happen again). It really needs a chat window so I can tell the other partner what I'm going to do and what works best with my playstyle. (Minimalistic and Dangerous).*The Lag in Co Op is awful. It doesn't happen until you get some serious business going on, but what happens is that you Pop faster than the computer can load. You often wait a full minute or two for a single round. People will disconnect due to this or just potato computers. It adds in A LOT of frustration.Rate: Banana/10If you like solo games that are cute, easy on the computer, and fun to play..I'd recommend this one. It takes a little time and its nice to get away from the big games that I play to come here and build towers. C:"

,Recommended,306020,16728521,"Posted: 26 June, 2015",all,Sharktrexer,"This review is separated into two parts; One for buying this game without playing the browser version and one in mind that you did play the browser version.For the People Who Didn't Play the Browser VersionBloons Tower Defense 5 (BTD 5) is the first BTD game to get on Steam. This means that there is no BTD 1-4 that you will find on Steam.This game is a very unique tower defense, having very unique towers (a total of 21) that each have their own ways of popping the games ""protagonist"" bloons. Some towers can pop some types of bloons the other can't, making you need to have a variety in your placed towers. Some towers even need a specific land type (A.K.A. water) to be placed. Each tower also costs an amount of cash, which you get from popping bloons. So if you don't spend th cash right, you can't expect yourself to win.Now, each tower doesn't just shoot at the bloons coming for you in a dedicated static path throughout the map (more on that later) each tower also have different projectiles they shoot. Some shoot an arching boomerang, while one shoots an exploding cannon, while some just shoot a piercing dart. Each tower also has a different and unique upgrade tree, leading them to shooting different, and more deadly projectiles, as well as having abilities on a cooldown. You don't just place towers and watch them shoot at the bloons, you have to also do some managing, as there is some strategy needed to really make where you place the towers, count. To also have some strategy added, there are support towers, that don't shoot bloons, but help you other towers perform better.Just like most tower defense games, there are different types of ""enemies"" (bloons) that come at you. Some are immune to explosions and freezing, others are undetectable and need special towers to attack them, while others just take a bunch of hits to pop. Either way it keeps the onslaught of bloons interesting and dangerous. You also have a limited amount of lives which the stronger the bloon, the more lives it will take from you when it reaches the exit. But... the waves that come at you are always the same, never changing, so you know what to expect, which could get stale for you. There is one remedy...Different maps! Each map is classed in how difficult the map is to try and keep the bloons from getting to the exit. Most maps have a unique theme and path that can keep you entertained, from there being 2 paths where the bloons come from, to having them do loops around an area. Some maps also have some awesome music to keep you wanting to keep playing.Now BTD 5 also has some interesting unique things you can do to help you defeat those darn bloons, and to keep your interest the game high. First of all there is XP and leveling up. Each level you earn unlocks either a new tower, a new upgrade, or even a new map. There is also a research center that you can use to generally help you, like make all your towers shoot faster, or to give you more starting cash at the start of the round. There are also temporary towers that last only last one game, and place-able objects you put on the track to pop the bloons, which can create some dumb and fun strategies you can make up!ProsA very unique Tower Defense gameLots of special elements to keep you playingAn easy game to get addicted toYou can easily pop in and out of a gameCo-opAn easy learning curveConsIt still is a basic tower defense gameThe resolution is bordered on the sidesThe resolution isn't that great to really begin withThe game can get stale quite fastIt probably isn't worth the whole 10 bucksI honestly think this is an amazing tower defense game to get into, and I highly recommed this game!For the People Who Did Play the Browser VersionNot many things have changed since the browser version. New features include 4 new towers, a new special agent tower, HD graphics, a new monkey lab which enables you to almost upgrade every tower and to upgrade general things, some new maps, and a 4th tier on the specialty class buildings. I played the browser version a lot, and I mean A LOT. I found this steam version and I wanted it right away. I don't regret it as I had 10 bucks lying around and I've been enjoying it. It'll be up to you to conclude if you want it, as really the BIG upside is that there is no micro-transactions.ProsBetter GraphicsThe game doesn't run on you browserThe game won't lag in the late waves (unless you have a REALLY bad computer)No micro-transactionsNew towers, maps, and other cool stuffConsThe new graphics may not appeal to some people10 bucks isn't a great priceStill the same old BTD 5 in retrospectI do still recommend this to you, even if you have played the browser version, as it can bring you to play the game more, and to love it all over again.ConclusionI honestly think, whether you have played the browser version or not, this game, even suffering some cons that could turn off a lot of people, I think it is still worth it, no matter if you are either, getting into the tower defense genre, a tower defense game fan, or a BTD die hard."

In my opinion this game needs all the maps from Flash and Mobile version. Some bugs and the problem with crashing when launched in windowed mode should be top priority. Only way to ""solve"" this is to edit your config.json from Appdata/Local/BTD5/Docs by setting windowed to 0, not false and never play in windowed mode.RECOMMENDATIONS : make tower clickboxes smaller, they are way too big, keep the thing where you can switch between 2 towers that are close by double clicking on one, fix the bug where we can't speed up/slow down or pick bananas when having a tower in hand and the range of the Monkey Beacon is wrong after getting 3 upgrades on right path, it doesn't show the increase but you can buff the tower outside of the range. Again all of that because i think the game was just ported. Oh yea and add Non-stop mode please.I'm writing this review to help Ninjakiwi make this game even better, I have no intent to trash this game because it is very fun and addictive. I 100% recommend this game if you like this genre of games. And the fact you got a free copy if you have BTD5 Deluxe is even better!"

This simple thing makes co'op very boring and kills it because most players just leave and afk while you do all the work.There is no 64 bit version of this game and the game runs slowly after a few rounds no matter how good your computer is. I really hope someday they add a 64 bit version of this game because this with a few fixes there would never be any lag, though the application will slow down after round 120.This game is still totally worth it and amazing, there is no lag unless you are doing freeplay and that's the end."

I haven't so far though.The game, being a freemium game on the browser and with micro transactions on the mobile version, has everything available for in-game currency (and only in-game currency) on Steam. Any benefits that you may purchase can be deactivated, meaning that those that are more insane, such as the Double Cash Mode, can be disabled at any time to avoid the game being too easy while still being available in case you are struggling with a daily challenge or want to let your younger siblings or kids play.Content-wise, there are over total 50 levels over five difficulties; Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert and Exteme. Each level can in turn be played in four different difficulties, all available both in normal and reverse paths. This should offer a challenge for both those new to tower defense games and the more experienced players.There is also a simple coop mode, which simply splits the map and money in half, and allows you to hand money to the other player. You can play both with steam friends and a random quick match. While this doesn't offer that much new, it is very fun to be able to play with friends.There are ten special missions available that make you think creatively, as well as 250 random missions with varying themes and difficulties. The special missions at least, are replayable at a lower rewards, in case you want to complete them differently, maybe with some perks disabled.Along with all this content, there are also weekly odysseys, which are 3-5 levels(depending on difficulty) that you must complete in a row, rewarding great treasure, and daily challenges(which is to complete a level with only four available towers) at all four difficulties so you can earn some extra cash.In short, there is no shortage of content and always a reason to return.The downsides are that the levels are fairly repetitive - all difficulties have a set order of bloons incoming in the rounds. The option menu is also somewhat lacking, the only options being cloud upload/download, mute/unmute music, mute/unmute sound effects and windowed mode, as well as a language options and the ability to change controls between click and drop and drag and drop.All in all, I would recommend the game to anyone, and at the current price it's basically a steal!"

,Recommended,306020,33364302,Posted: 7 July,all,sheep108,"This game is so much fun! And you can quote me on that statement. I have had probably thousands of hours of fun with the flash version of the game and boy, let me tell you something. This steam version is 100x better. And here is why you should buy it.Pros:-The battles can be as short or as long as you want. (The average time it takes me to do a hard difficulty is around 15minsbut my longest battle was over 4 hours!)-(Steam integration) It has a multiplayer co-op game mode that is fun and just works. No messing around making ""newaccounts"" withdifferent servises you jsut play with a random person or you can create a game and play with yourbuddy. No prot forwerding or anything stupid.-It seems to be a very non microtransaction game. Heck I can't even find a button to buy the in game currency! Just buythe game once and you have everything in it for life! No paid dlc for some ""wikid sick new item"" or whatever.-Great soundtrak :)-Its a very easy game to play, but hard to master. It might look all cute and easy on the outside but, the stratagy isactually decently complex. Yes some towers might be objectionally better than others but, its not as if you are at a realdisatvantage by using them. Wich brings me on to my next comment...-Some of the best ballancing in video game history (In my opionon) Thats all there is to say. Its fair. You mess up in yourstratagy, you get punished for it. You want to do some goofy stratagy with jsut glue gunners and spike factorys then gofor it! All the towers feel very well ballanced. Yes some are more powerfull than others slightly but as I said before yournot putting yourself at much of a disatvantage by using them. Even I use glue gunners and boomerang monkeys andthey shine at very specific roles in specific situations but there still good if you use them like any other tower in any map!-The comunity behind it is very active, I think that this game also connects up to the flash game on there website aswell(will have to test that or ask NinjaKiwi on that) but if that is so then the comunity is very big. Considering theoversaturated game market in general.-A decent sellection of maps to choose from and master with lots of verayaty in them. (They all work well in co op too!)-To be honest I could list 100 no even 1000 or more good things about this game. Lets get on to the cons shall we :)Cons:-Adictive, ""Just one more game!"" you tell yourself *looks at clock* 5am and its a work day.-Not really much else here to be honest.-I am being nit picky here and I would say more maps and/or game modes added.In short: Its a fun game that will satisfy all of your bloon popping needs :) I would give this game a 9.5/10 -Its fun!Have fun poping them darn bloons!"

First, and most obvious, is that it costs real money to buy unlike the flash version. Also, to unlock some game modes and upgrades you have to grind. Alot.

You earn more money if you pick a harder level. With that money you can buy fundamental upgrades in the main menu.For example on level ""easy"" you play 50 rounds. It is pretty easy and not a real challenge if you aren't a beginner. After that 50 rounds you can play the ""free-modus"". It means you just go on with the rounds and you earn less XP to climb the ranking.Didn't tried the co-op modus yet!Full HD - Great Graphics if I compare it to my memories of the old browser-game version.Less Lagg! - Well, I thought it might be like in those old days - The higher your Round in which you are playing, the more lagg. But the game isn't even lagging in Level 130.. It just gets a little confusing if there are so many MOAB's etc. :DFor those who wonder, my specifications aren't the newest:CPU: Intel Core 2 Quad Q9550 @ 2.83GHzGPU: Gainward GeForce GTX570 PhantomRAM: Kingston HyperX 8 GB RAM DDR3-1600 (9-9-9-24)SSD: Samsung 850 PRO 256GB (SATA 6Gb/s)I'd really recommend this game if you like the Tower-Defense Genre.Rating: ★★★★★"

If you like TD, this is where you should be.Played the IOS version for abut 100+ hours, unlocking most abilities, beating most of the levels up to Unpoppable.  I'm buying this version now because the lag is too insane when playing the later difficulties.  This game might set a record for ""most explosions at once"" as it's not unusual to pop 100s (if not 1000s) of incoming bloons in one go, especially later with abilities, which makes my smartphone & gameboy glitch out.  It's a good game on the phone & java, but this game is too good for those platforms & fully desereves a space on your computer if you are serious about winning the later levels.  The lag spikes are pushing your hardware to its limits as ""Bloons"" pushes it's own pop-p-ping possibilities.  After all of this, I am willing to buy it on a 3rd device.  I *want* to win!The RPG like aspects of alternate advancement paired with penalties make the classes brilliant, each specialty helping to solve levels in unique & creative ways.  The grind is fun and sensible, feeling naturally progressive with challenges.  What begins as a normal TD game turns into semi-real-time gaming with abilities needing to be qued up at the right times.   The further you go, the faster their cast time may be reduced, resulting in what essentially turns into an action / quick turn-based game of sorts.  For example, one must collect bananas as quickly as possible.  Like it?  Tap away!  Don't like it?  Level up the Bloon Shredder to do it automatically for you!  This is brilliant thinking for those of us who would like a choice in our play style.The tactical placement of towers allows for lots of creative control.  There is no wrong way to build things if your monkeys are skilled.  Some levels require very unique strategies.  With radar, some units can be used for recon, allowing for submarines to destroy bloons from afar.  The Monkey Hut especially allows for grand strategy, as all buffed monkeys must be within it's range.  Having 3 huts specializing in say, ability timers, money, & power mean that 3 stations will be doing separate tasks and then have multiple monkeys (even of the same class) doing different jobs.  This is pertinent to aim, which completes the formula, allowing monkeys to target the first, last, closest, or strongest bloons, plus a few more specialty shots for other classes.  The combinations seem endless.This is a TD game we're talking about here!  It sounds more like a TBRPG or war game.  Popping bloons may seem silly, but it's progressive casual play grows over time to seriously difficult insanity.This is Bloons.  It's the most fun I've ever had playing a TD & one of my favorite games of all time.  I can go to it to relax.  I can go to it for a real challenge.  It's good ol' family gaming fun.  I can't recommend 'Bloons' enough."

,Not Recommended,306020,19235508,"Posted: 23 November, 2015",all,Yiasmat,"(05/10) - Wasted PotentialBloons TD has one of the best mechanics in the history of TDs and yet somehow throws away all knowlage it has by making way too many wrong choices.Whenever you play a level of BTD5 you can actually see that the developer reeeeeally knows the genre and has some reeeal potential of making a good TD.But sadly what this game amounts to is playing the same missions multiple times to unlock all medals, which is way too repetitive already, and then somehow making it worse by having the same enemies in EVERY SINGLE MISSION.I generally think it´s a bad idea to unlock all difficulties right from the start (which this game basically does after one hour of playtime) if you have something to farm. Why open up those difficulties if you can´t beat them unless you bought some upgrades. That was the essential flaw of Defense Grid 2 and is once again devastating.But as i said, why would you ever ever ever ever have all missions have the same enemies.At the start of the game you play through wave 1-50 on easy, then maybe 1-65 and then playing through 1-85 twice. Essentially you play the waves 1-50 four times in EVERY MAP! I just can´t get behind it.Other than that i really dislike that you can ""freely"" place the towers. There are no spots predetermined for them so itching you mouse a tad bit to the right might validate the placement of the tower you want to build, but i guess thats only my opinion.When i look back to this game, the only thing i see is wasted potential of a developer that clearly has the knowlage of how TDs are supposed to work. Such a shame."

The Entrance is always marked, so you know what's coming.Each tower itself has 2 upgradable attributes but after the second upgrade to both you need to pick a path,which leads to an entirely different unit. The Basic Dart Monkey, for example.First you can upgrade the range and the attack power.The branches lead to a spiky-ball-catapult and a tripleshot, respectively, each with their own advantages,and besides that part of strategy, each map also offers many options for tower placement, and you'llwanna think it through. Though Easy mode is pretty much impossible to screw up.So, there's only one real criticism I have and that's probably due to my own stupidity.The messages you receive when starting a game are repeated each game.There might be a way to disable those but I didn't really look for it yet,but one thing that usually annoys me slightly is a repeating tutorial text x3Again, I think I'm just too thick to find the button that disables it.Overall, I love it, it's just very unique and well made.

76561198219804399,Recommended,306020,26429013,"Posted: 4 November, 2016",all,cbfont01,"Gameplay: use towers to pop balloons. The main difficulties are when the balloons rush you and the bloons that take many hits to get. There are also camofloged balloons, steel balloons, regrowing balloons, etc. You have a limited amount of 'cash' per round that you get popping bloons or via towers and then use to buy towers. There is 50+ tracks at 4 difficulties, 250 random missions, and more. The regular gameplay gets a bit boring after a while, but the random missions make up for it by requiring the use of specific towers or changing up the types of balloons on a specific track. There are also special agents you can 'buy' with money money. There is a co-op mode that some people like, altough I prefer to play individually so I can't say much about it.I own this game on Kindle fire. That said, I would definitely recommend this version over the free version on the Kindle. When using the Kindle, I had quite a bit of problems with lag. Some towers fire too many bolts and some they added unneccesary decoration like the moving flames on the apprentice tower full upgrade. Also, in this version you can 'buy' certain upgrades with monkey money instead of real cash.As for the cons of this game, the achievements are fairly badly done. I like comparing my progress to everyone else, but that doesn't really work in this game. Some, like fully upgrade starting cash, have gotten much more difficult to obtain due to updates. They also have an achievement for every track on co-op and regular mode, which makes the acheivements a bit arbitrary as some people will by change complete one track before another. There are way too many achievements too."

Very neat graphics and mechanics.VERY GOOD variety of maps, towers, upgrades and difficulties - it can be very challenging if that's what you want, but also well suited to casual players that don't want to spend too much time learning the key strategic principles of the game. It has a good sense of progression: you have the option to research and improve several specific capacities to help your towers; daily challenges of varying difficulties and small temporary events. On top of the plethora of achievements.The Co-op mode is very well made and can be very fun, requiring decent teamwork on harder maps/difficulties and adding a very interesting facet to the game overall.Overall a very good tower defense from NK that can't help but make awesome games."

The daily challenges are pretty fun, and should keep you distracted from your real life responsibilities for a while.The game is fairly challenging until you unlock the double cash mode (which essentially doubles your income). Without this mode, the hardest difficulty is pretty much impossible. When you enable this, it makes the Impossible difficulty completly trivial.I recommend it if you are feeling like playing a casual TD game, but at this point (about 30 hours of gameplay), I have lost interest in it."

Also, this game has lots of maps and a wide selection of modes (Difficulties, Sandbox, Impoppable. I like the pun) each giving you different rewards. This game, although brilliant, is not perfect. Some of the things I'd like to improve are:1. Some of the prices of in - game purchase. (Not with real money)2.

,Recommended,306020,31947737,Posted: 25 May,all,Blingtron,"TLDR: One of the best TD games out there, with a crazy amount of replayability, but could use some balancing and reworking to remain fun.What I think:If you've played any of the Bloons games in flash or on mobile, then you know what to expect... This is like the super version of any of those. If you haven't, google it and try one. Bloons TD 5 contains a great variety of maps and towers, and some interesting challenges. If it's on sale, I highly recommend buying it, but at full price it feels steep compared to the mobile version.Ultimately the game is a lot of fun. I find myself coming back to it like a crack addict for bursts of play. I do have some minor ♥♥♥♥♥ing to express, which I've seen mentioned by others. I feel I should state my opinions so that if you're considering buying this game for long-term play, you will know about the end-game.There are two main issues with Bloons TD 5, which are the repetitiveness of the experience, and the ease of gaining god-like overpoweredness without consequence. In my opinion, the biggest offender is double money, which either shouldn't be a thing, or should be treated as a ""cheat"" and have achievements disabled while it's active. It's just way too overpowered. After I bought it with the in-game currency (which only takes a few hours of gameplay at first to earn), I eventually turned it off to make the game a fair challenge. But even with it off, the sheer number of times you must play the same sequence of balloons over and over again on so many levels in order to progress is just ridiculous. I'm at 40 hours played, which I think is a ton for such a casual game, and I'm just about halfway to unlocking the medium track mastery levels. But the game at this level is not difficult... It's just a serious time investment to unlock something that I will probably be able to beat immediately anyways.The devs simply release new, uninspired maps every once in a while, and call them updates... If they would just take the time used in making a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ new map and instead address these balancing issues, or engage with the community for feedback and ideas, I think this game could easily be the best TD games ever. If you're reading this, ninjakiwi, there are more than enough maps in this game, pls stahp... but the game as a whole has issues, two of which I just mentioned, that could be resolved or at the very least addressed to make this game so much better and even attract a wider fanbase."

One) That you have to grind for something like double cash or that tower upgrade you wanted like a Bloonjutsu or that Moab Assassin the game makes you want to achieve that thing. Two) That there is more than Twenty tracks plus you can play them all at least seven times *not sandbox* Deflation Apopalypse Hard Impoppable Easy Medium Reverse. Three) That you can play Co-op Pretty insane for a TD game to have it and that you can do fun special missions or do random missions WHATEVER but I played the living hell out of this game and I really reccomend buying it.

This game has plentiful towers with strategies to take on more difficult levels and difficulties. Unlike previous games which only had the modes easy, medium and hard this one includes impoppable mode where you only have one life and mastery mode which is a mood where the bloons are one tier above normal which can be very challenging yet so satisfying after completion. Mac support,low system requirements and hard effort by Ninja Kiwi has allowed this game to stay relevant through the years and for it to shape a generation of tower defense games."

I love collecting the medals on every track i can and it delivers something kind of rare in the bloons series: Variety.  because you have so many towers to play with ALL avaivable to you you cannot go wrong with mixing and matching, Those are the pros, Here are the cons: Unlocking Mastery mode is VERY time consuming and grindy, (altough once you unlock it you will have a absolute blast) The golden bloon is very easy to defeat, (too easy) just farm alot and you will get enough money for a 2-3 village and your bloonjitsus will wreck the bloon. Other then that this game is AWESOME!!!! I would like to see some more boss bloons (They dont have to be elemental) and maybe a story line or some lore to along with the bosses, One more pro is that there is always a special event, whether its bloonsvasion, the golden bloon or the bosses which makes for a blast!"

,Not Recommended,306020,31643077,Posted: 9 May,all,eastpaw,"There are some things I like a lot about this game... but some aspects of it make me hate it far more. Because of these latter characteristics, I have decided I shall stop torturing myself with this game.Basically, I like brinkmanship and getting perfect scores. Unfortunately, Bloons TD *really* punishes you for these.First off, levels are very long - close to 100 waves at the higher difficulty settings, with each wave possibly lasting minutes.Second: if you fail a level, you have to replay it from the beginning unless you're willing to shell out a goodly amount of hard-earned (in-game) cash; there is no cheaper rewind function.Third: the waves progress in difficulty in very uneven fashion - not only is the difficulty increase not linear, some levels can only be cleared if your towers have specific properties.Fourth: there is no indicator of what you will face in upcoming waves. Either you memorize the wave patterns or you build blindly and hope for the best.Fifth: if you fail a level, you gain absolutely nothing.Together, these facts mean that you can't easily experiment to find a near-perfect solution. If you do not relish having to continually replay the same tedious parts of the same tedious levels over and over, you have to go for stop-gap imperfect solutions (which may still result in you still losing the level several tens of waves later). And because you don't get a single coin or dollar or whatever from failed experiments, a perfectionist can spend hours testing a map and have nothing tangible to show for them.A second thing I hate about this game is the pixel-hunting required for truly optimal tower placement. Again, perfectionists will end up tearing their hair out. Sure, you could just plop down towers unthinkingly. But if you're trying to maximally use the map space available to you, pixel-hunting is your only choice. I really much prefer systems in which you have clearly defined spaces to build on.Finally, I really hate the music in this game. It's frankly annoying as hell. I very rarely play a game with the sound/music muted, but this is one of those.Edit: why have I clocked 25 hours in this game if I hate it so much? Actually, most of those hours were logged after I had fallen asleep from boredom while playing. Not even kidding."

Wooo!Let me point out that I don't consider a game ""beaten"" until either all achievements or a strong majority of achievements are done.So to ""beat"" this nightmarish game, you must do 100 daily challenges, do 250 random missions, most of which take place in the same 6 maps or so despite being over 50 throughout the game, and not only do you have to grind for the extreme track mastery, but you must also grind many, many co-op maps.This is utterly ridiculous, taking a simple idea, adding more to it, making several games out of it, and making each game a huge, unnecessary grind is absolute-Sorry got carried away.Anyhow, this game is very boring, and I wish I never bought it in the first place to waste 100+ hours of my life.

I lost all the buildings I had and all the Medals I had earned. I tried to find a way to restore my account, but I couldn't find any way. I love this game, but I really don't want to restart and if there was a way to get back what I had, I'd happily play again. But for now, I'm sadly going to have to give it a poor review. :("

Now to get into details i find this version of BTD5 easier somehow, i don't know if it's the towers or the new coin system of buying upgrades. The only big problem i have with this one is, there's no coop chat. They said they'll add it soon in one of there posts but that was years ago. To me i find this offensive and saddening, it's like they've given up on putting it in. there are some new things to this verion however like the new towers ( engineer, helicopter and the bloon chipper) and a few new tracks. I would stick with the website version unless you what the achievements or to use the new stuff that's in this version.Pros:-Cartoons graphics that work well with the game-New towers-New upgrades to buy with coins (Coins you get in-game)-No pay to win mahanics like in the website versionCons:-Free verion on website-No coop chat-Easier-DeathKillerRockI rate 4.5/10"

New to this version is Co-op/Multiplayer this felt very half-backed because the Co-op has you controlling 1-side of a map and the other player the other, this felt pointless as I never felt like playing these modes though because there is no real point to it becuase the connection can be bad not saying it is always bad it just is a bad idea that could have improvements and to 'fanboys' out there I don't care if you think having one side while your partner has the other is good, because it is not. finale co-op thoughts, add both players can place buildings anywhere however the maps used for the split co-op are well planned but make me feel like that one side i'm playing is one whole map. And finnaly lets move onto ""is this better then the FREE one on Ninja Kiwi"" and to that I say there is no significant difference apart from a few new towers for example: Helicopter, Submarine and Bloon-Chipper (all of which come with their own tower upgrade path) so I would say you don't need to get this at all if you don't mind the small lack of towers, play on Ninja Kiwi and save your money.      4/10+New upgrades that add small bonuses+Fullscreen (with boarders) feels great-Very few new towers that are not worth the money-Unoticable/boring Co-op/Multiplayer-No graphic change to web version-Game lacks enough new features to make the cost worth it-the only way to obtain the premium currency (gold coins) is by completing levels and agents should not cost gold coins but instead be given to you when you complete levels"

And you just have to wait up to those levels for challenge which is very boring.4- Very repetative gameplay. Disregarding the map and difficulty level, balloons always spawn in the same order.5- To get more money and more coin you need to play easy and medium level while you already bet the hard level which I really really hate.6- Some combos are too powerful such as Shredder + Submarine.7- Hard mode should not be just sending insanely large amount of balloons in last 2 turns."

If you need 1 map and there are 13 then you have a 1 out of 14 chance of getting it and thats not counting the chance that the other player doesnt need it or will Diconnect for whatever reason. when you finally get the map you want. you have to pray that the other person doesnt disconnect later in game because that is a lot of wasted time. Sometimes you get lucky, and the person just doesnt need map and will dc right away. Id recomend the free version its not better but this version isnt worth much more than the free version since you cant beat free. if you can get it for 60% off go for it.PS game is a HUGE grindfest if you want achieveys.

It's even hard to run medium on beginner tracks without intense resource management, special boosts, and ""special agents"". It's easy to get stuck in a loop where you lack the money for bonuses, but need the bonuses to win the money to buy the bonuses. Pretty stupid.Not a good game after the few early levels unless you're hardcore."

This is exceptionally frustrating considering how much time is wasted cumulatively just trying to get through the menus that are clearly designed for mobile platforms. These menus could be easily improved and would reduce the amount of time not playing significantly. The following questions help clarify these menu and GUI issues:Why do I need to turn pages to see all the towers available?Why do I need to go to settings to turn on auto-play when there is room all over the screen? To include the bars on the left and right making a 4:3 aspect ratio.Why do I need to scroll through all the targeting priorities when you could easily click the one you want (like in the flash version)?Why can't I select the maps or upgrades from an easy list rather than swiping optimized method (I know there is a sorting method but this is insufficient)?Why is it that when I click on a tower next to another one, my selection alternates between the two when I am clearly clicking on only one of them?Don't get me wrong, I will keep playing the game but the menus are absolutely frustrating. Play the free flash version, the extra towers and maps are not worth the cost (at least at full price), and definitely not worth the cost of time navigating.

So the game never becomes unfair, because you can try many different tactics.There is also the possibility to do random missions, where you are only allowed to use a specific number of towers, so the game becomes even more tactical. I really like these missions, because they brings some variety into the game.The only thing bothering me is the coop mode. It is not like you are working together with someone, it is more like you are sharing a map with someone else and you build your towers how you like it. The communication is missing and that doesn't make it feel like a coop. Otherwise if you have a friend who you can communicate with then it might be a lot of fun.And last but not least: the little monkeys are too cute :3"

It's not the sort of game you'll play for hours at a time, it's more like something you open up to play when you have 20-30 minutes free and don't feel like getting super invested in anything. Sort of like a mobile game for the PC.Even though this is essentially a port of a mobile/flash game, it has enough polish to make it feel like it's worth playing on a computer. I actually enjoy playing it a lot more on the computer because you have a lot better control over where to put towers and a lot more access to useful information.The only thing I don't really like is how it's kind of boring in the beginning to do all the tracks on easy. You don't have to do them on easy if you don't want to, but if you're like me and want to get all the medals, then you'll be spending a lot of time being kind of bored. Honestly, I feel that if you complete a track on a certain difficulty, you should also get the medals for all the lesser difficulties. Instead of making us do each track three times to get the Olympian achievements.There ARE microtransactions in the game, as in the PC versions, but you don't need them at all to complete everything, so don't let them put you off."

It's got flaws (no retroactive difficulty rewards, less than satisfying target options, subpar UI, minimal options), but it's worth picking up."

I've played each of the games as they've come out throughout the years, but I'll try to write this review without my nostalgia glasses on.This game is a really cute concept about little monkeys popping balloons with darts before they reach the end of a map. There are several tower types, each with unique attributes and perk branches that leave you with dozens of strategies to try out. The main strategic aspect of this game comes from map design rather than balloon type differences by level. My main complaint with this game is that no matter what map you play on, the balloon output will be exactly the same by level. Camo balloons always comes on round 24, blimps on 46, etc. That being said, you can't just use the same strategy every time because the maps vary so much.There is a free online flash version of this game, but this version updates more frequently and has a few features, game types, and towers unavailable elsewhere. Granted, those features aren't necessarily worth $10 in my opinion. The only feature the online version has that this one doesn't is a chat function in co-op, which I feel needs to be added. I definitely don't regret my purchase, I really enjoy this game, but I would recommend waiting until this game is on sale if you're interested in buying it."

Watching the balloons (bloons) travel around and then shoring up weak spots actually almost put me to sleep. Better than counting sheep :p... i get bored after 3 sheep.(also i love how it says 1.9 hours played but on the refund screen it says 2 hours and on my launcher it says 114 minutes)

BTD was an old series thought up by Ninja-Kiwi (or taken upon by NinjaKiwi) about Tower Defence. It came around in the time when Tower Defence flash games were kicking it, and its one of the few to remain popular throughout it. BTD was about a bunch of monkeys keeping balloons from killing them, wierd huh? Well the Monkey's Tricks are spectacular. Each Tower has its own pros and cons, and can upgrade based on two paths, each one can be upgraded up to twice, but then you must choose which path the Towers upgrades finish through, Right or Left. Each one leads to a powerful new Tower that can either do MASSIVE damage to 'Bloons' or help support their fellow monkeys on the front. But, BTD was always a childerens game, hence why its art style is so. The Game has 3 forms of currency, Match currency which resets every Match, Monkey-Money which allows players to purchase elite units, and Coins which allow the player to purchase upgrades for their account to improve lives, starting cash, or Tower attack speed. Leveling is hard and tedious, and if you happen to accidently 'Delete' your save, you'll lose everything and go back to square one. BTD DOES get boring after awhile but can be revived by letting someone else try it out. If you're looking for something to kill time, play with friends, or challenge others to, Bloons Tower Defence 5 is a game for you to try (P.S. They added more towers in the purchasable version, not the free one on their website >:L)"

You can't choose what map you wanna play in, you just get a random one. Making it so, that you start to run more often into maps you have already beaten and therefore can't get a new medal = most people quit game and re-search- Occasional game freeze + crash, occasional savegame corruption (maybe once every 100 games for me) Yet still annoying when you have invested time and effort to get to say 83/85 map and game dies on you, leaving you only with losses from buying agents.Overall I would recommend this game for people who enjoy casual relaxed TD. 10€ Fairly high price indeed, but in terms of how much time you can spend playing this game, it ain't that much.I would rate 4/5. Max rating when they decide to add some type of possibility to actually play co-op with random people."

Originally starting out as a browser-based game series, the latest entry has recently seen a full release on mobile platforms like Android and the PC. And rightfully so, since Bloons TD5 is, frankly, one of the finest tower defense games on the market right now, easily stacking up against such titans as the aforementioned Plants vs. Zombies. Featuring a cute cast of memorable characters in the form of intelligent, organized monkeys, the player has to employ said characters to defend a series of widely varied and challenging tracks. The enemy: a horde of hostile, baloon-like entities collectively referred to as Bloons. If too many Bloons make it through the player's defenses, the game is over. It's a simple formula, but one that's easy to get into and spend countless hours with. In addition, there's plenty of modes to play through, including an online co-op mode, daily challenges, and special missions designed to test the player's skill. However, if there's one gripe to be had, it's that the game lacks a story-driven campaign mode, though the vast amount of content the game offers up compensates for that.Overall, Bloons TD5 is an amazing and very enjoyable casual game that serves as a refreshing take on the tower defense genre, and should not be missed under any circumstances.Final Verdict:I love it.Until next time, this is Richard,Signing off."

So I saw this on steam and thought I might give it a try. And I will say that this version is way better than the steam version.To start with, it's a great tower defense game. The first few tracks are are pretty easy but there are tons of these tracks, and they get reallllyyyyy hard after awhile. And with the steam version there's all sorts of new additions that spice up the game. it's a great game to waste time on, or run in the background when you get to higher levels.

The flash version runs terrible on my PC, but the steam version is amazing."
,Recommended,306020,29975128,Posted: 16 February,all,Cabelio Cometier,"Currently I have logged 143 hours on this game, 500 on the flash version, and 1000 on the DSi BTD4. I reccomend this game on many fronts. Those who complain the mobile's cheaper and the flash is free, this version takes the freemium (In game paid boosts/ in app purchases) and makes the main currency (monkey money) replace them. This version gets a lot right. My only complaint is no chat, but that somehow doesn't stay an issue prominent enough to hold it back from being the first thing I think of when I see ""Good tower defence"". The soundtrack is repetitive, but catchy enough to justify it's small amount of variations. It has semi-common updates and daily mini events like boss fights, golden bloons, or even double ingame cash reward! It has very few new towers, the engineer (Which can be found on cpu only in bmc so great upgrade over flash) Sub (which recently got added to flash main version) Heli (finally another aerial tower (this one can be aimed) and bloonchipper (insanely strong but cant naturally see lead or handle large groups of green or higher), but each of them are unique and are hard to get sick of or roll off of my strategy. However, they don't drown out the other towers (unlike BTD Battle's Cobra (D:< I get sick of the cobra!) which everyone who has it spams it) which makes a good package if I am qualified to say that. Everyone hates on Ninja Kiwi because they haven't added chat, but that's so we can have enough co-op players, as everyone hates on the steam version (for the higher initial price, but no in app, once again), and buys the mobile. In order to keep co-op playable, they made it so steam players can play quick play co-op (sadly not private match) with mobile players, spreading out the numbers. I've heard almost nothing about mastery mode, because almost nobody can make it there, but that gives you a large array of giant challenges after you beat a horde of other maps. However, the action never gets stale for me, so it keeps itself interesting enough to compel me to reach for it. It's an endless cycle of joy, wreck face with free in app purchase money, proceed to (not in flash) impoppable mode and die 3 times on the same map. There's always incentive, such as specialty buildings (big addition being tier 4 specialty buildings), lab coins buffs (basically a way to buff your towers permanently and make a direct form of progress but not too steep), or random challenges (It takes a very large list of cheaply (but still high quality experience) made challenges that have a little pun usually and give you a reward for special requirements (Mainly for dem achievements) in hopes of getting to a few super rare special ones), leaving an endless plane of happiness. No matter how you put it, the goods (by far) outweigh the bads. Buy it, 9.9999999999998/10 would pop 2 Googolplex (real number) bloons and forget about a day and not be angry at all. Oh yeah.

Like, there is something so irresistably alluring about just plunking something down and watching it mow down a row of baddies, and frantically trying to catch that last straggler that your other towers cant quiiiiite reach before it hits your zone. Bloons TD 5 is the best Tower Defense game ever made. I mean, you can think otherwise, but you are wrong and smelly if you do. This game is just so stupidly good. The popping sound of the balloons is seared into my goddamn memory and when the robots take over and scan my brain for potential goodies they can snatch they'll be linked to an audio file of the sound the super monkey makes when you upgrade it to shoot lasers. ♥♥♥♥ this stupidly good game. My only complaint is sometimes the maps are wierdly drawn and its hard to tell whats in bounds and whats not. Stupid game and not being totally perfect, unlike me, who is totally perfect. Stupid idiot game. Buy it."

It has so many different options for towers and unique upgrades I can't even begin. The amount of maps and variety of them is just insane. I bought this game for both ios and android and after finding out it was on steam, I had to buy it a third time. Best mobile game, best tower defense game.

76561198158579793,Not Recommended,306020,29328678,Posted: 17 January,all,/,"The game is good at first. But it's the updates and the developers lack of community suggestions. For example, they might add a suggestion from one singular thread that has almost no interest by the community. People have been begging for new towers, and other more deeper gameplay mechanics. Now the devs have just been pushing out more and more maps. And more uninsteresting events that reward you with maybe 1 token (one of the game's currency). It's very good at first, however you'll quickly realize that you want to refund it after 30 or so hours. Also modding is not allowed.Everything else is good. Graphics are nice, there aren't many bugs, the UI is clean, and controls are great.But, for the reasons in the first paragraph, if you want a game with basically no replayabillity, buy it. Maybe for a few dollars if you're very interested. Sidenote; NinjaKiwi (the company that made the game) gave a youtuber (that makes clickbait, low-effort videos) gave free in-game currencies and bonuses-that-can-only-be-bought-using-money in a seperate game (the game is called Bloons TD Battles) made by the same company. This youtuber barely did anything to have NinjaKiwi give him those items. From what I see on his videos, it's only because of his sub count, views, and that he is 'friends' with the devs."

,Recommended,306020,23912416,"Posted: 28 June, 2016",all,MPO,"It's gorgeous compared to the Flash version, and there's so much more content (more on that later). It's more stimulating, replayable, and relaxing than most other tower defense games, including either Defense Grid game. There's also a catchy, but limited soundtrack - but the game is great for listening to your own tunes in the background.Still, some questionable design choices hold back the experience: namely, the mindset that sheer quantity trumps quality. This everything-and-the-kitchen-sink attitude permeates the game: its overwhelming number of achievements, unlock conditions, levels, towers, and power-ups are riddled with redundancy and balance issues.  It can be very hard to make meaningful choices.Overall, it's definitely worth the money and time. You'll get bored well before finishing the content, but not before sinking your teeth into an engrossingly fun experience."
