76561198009078453,Not Recommended,306040,26181204,"Posted: 23 October, 2016",all,Aurélien,"TL;DR: The Howler is a slow, extremely tedious game that will test your patience and relies on an art style that doesn't compliment nor is complimented by either the gameplay or the sound design, causing frustration (did I mention that you gotta wait for everything, even bringing the pause menu is slow) especially when using the gimmick, sound-based control feature.The Howler is another gimmick ""arty"" indie game that hides its more than shallow and lackluster gameplay behind supposedly stunning art and visuals; which I normally have no problem with but in this case the graphics are far from gorgeous:I presume it's supposed to fit into a certain art style given that (quote from the game's store page) ""All art used in the Howler was meticulously created by classically-trained experienced painters."" but this art style is not meant for games, it just doesn't work and looks like a scanned colored pencil piece of drawing. It has terrible affordance and does a very poor job at showing what element is going to pop the balloon and what is just part of the background.Still going on the art: the sound design is dull and repetitive, as if they forgot to implement any sound and rushed it at the last minute.I will however admit that the first time the balloon approaches the iron Wolf, and the jaw opens with a deep, metallic sound, it was pretty cool.The gameplay, even though not the most important part in this kind of game, barely exists: it's roughly clicking and waiting with little challenge other than testing your patience.The sound control gimmick (note that I'm consciously using the word gimmick rather than feature) is forgettable. It's not bad, but it's far from good. It's forgettable for the very reason that it has little to no gameplay to be applied on!And regarding the level design, I'm hesitant whether it has been made by someone with little experience or someone simply lazy: it's over-simplistic and very repetitive.As a conclusion I'd like to address some errors in the store page user-defined tags:- Adventure: No. It's certainly not an Adventure game.- Simulation: I can see why this tag, but it barely simulates anything.- Strategy: Oh please, strategy? No. Strategy is term that defines long-term thinking and process. Even the word ""tactical"" would be more fitting here.- Action: Ahah... If your definition of Action is: click-wait-click-wait-wait-wait-click... then yes, maybe.- Shoot 'Em Up: Oh come on! Now that's just blatant lies.- Sports: What the f...- Puzzle: Nope. The Howler is very simplistic so no thinking requiered.- Difficult: No. Tedious.I give this game the rating of 15/100"

It's been sat, waiting patiently, for a day where I have absolutely nothing else to do. Today was that day, and The Howler certainly helped me get through a hour or so until I went to get my Chinese takeaway.The artwork, as others have said, is beautiful. Really really well done on that part :) But the main thing that grasped me about this game was the alternate controls- the ability to use your microphone to do all the controlling! None of my steam games have surprised me with a feature like this before- it made the game so much more fun! Others have said how boring and slow the game can be, but this feature brings your concentration to a whole new level.THAT said- there were a few kinks to be worked out with the feature. At times it can be a little TOO sensitive- when a car drove past outside my balloon would fly away, or even on the Wolf cave level, the sound of the passage opening would be loud enough to also blow the balloon away... I have to complete that level using the mouse, which was a little disappointing.One more point about problems while playing- your balloon CAN touch some objects/walls... but not all? And it's not obvious what will and what wont pop your balloon. This became quite frustrating in the more tightly spaced levels :/All in all, really lovely little game, I'd recommend it to anyone for the unique controls input alone, especially as it's so cheap. REALLY wish this game had some achievements!!! Would play through the whole thing again for some achievements (Wink wink nudge nudge Mr Dev)- also it was nice getting 3/5 trading cards from drops :) That made the cute little badge nice and attainable too (Y)<3"
,Recommended,306040,28572255,"Posted: 23 December, 2016",all,xXxX_BL4d3_XXxX,"I was very surprised by this short but sweet game, particularly considering how cheap it is. The premise of the game, to control a hot air balloon, is very simple, yet made interesting by the challenge of having to navigate often precarious routes. The game's controls are intuitive, as the only control over the balloon the player has is to increase its altitude, and to drop objects. The balloon's direction and speed are left to the whim of the wind, as the wind direction and speed alter according to altitude. By keeping both the premise and mechanics of the game simple and intuitive, yet introducing a new idea or challenge with each of 16 levels, the game kept me both intrigued and somewhat intellectually stimulated. Some aspects of the game I particularly enjoyed are the art style and music, and ability to use audio as a form of input instead of the mouse, which works very well. However, as with almost any game, there are a few aspects I would have liked to see imrpoved. Firstly, the inability to rebind controls, such as using the arrow keys instead of left click, the fact that the game doesn't scale with screen size, meaning there is a lot of unused black space around it, and the inability to move the camera independently from the balloon as I sometimes felt that my field of view was unnecessarily constrained. Yet, despite all of its flaws, I was left thouroughly satisfied by the game, and despite only taking up to an hour to complete, I would not expect any more for its price."

Clicking the mouse (or making noise if you have a compatible microphone) makes the balloon go up. In each level, you need to manoeuvre the balloon through a parcours by making use of the wind. There are areas in which the wind blows the balloon forward and there are areas in which the wind blows the balloon back.At first, this simple idea looks promising. The first few levels are fun. But soon, the real difficulty pops up: level after level, you need to manoeuvre the balloon through spikey things. And the balloon snaps on the slightest contact with spikey things, so it requires perfect timing. At that point, you realize the game is actually a lot like an unforgiving old-school platformer game. You know, a game that requires you to try and try again until you pretty much know the exact timing to get through each level. I'm sure a lot of people enjoy games like that, and they will enjoy The Howler for what it is, but I think it's only fair to warn other people about the nature of this game because it doesn't show from the description and the screenshots.What youcantell from watching the screenshots, is that the artwork is very nice and pretty unique for an indie game like this. It's also a cheap game, especially when on sale, so if you're not sure whether to try it after reading this and some other reviews, I'd say give it a go. But because the Howler is not the sort of game I expected and because I simply didn't enjoy the game for what it turned out to be, I can't generally recommend this game so I feel obligated to click the 'thumbs down' button."
,Recommended,306040,29748737,Posted: 6 February,all,Raymond,"The Howler Review - Raymond KTFollowing the general outline of the Lithuanian novel The Hour of the Wolf by Andrius Tapinas, the game is set in an alternate steampunk version of Vilnius, Lithuania. In order to observe the goings on around the city, Antanas Sadabras, the legate of Vilnius, takes to his hot air balloon. During his observations, Antanas discovers that rioters are planning an attack on the city and that they have released automatons throughout the airspace as part of their scheme. With his precious city in peril, it is up to Antanas to stop the rioters and return Vilnius to normalcy.The story is simple, straightforward, and is presented to players through minimalist snippets of text just before you begin a mission. It's not extensive and it's not complex, but it gets the job done. That being said, I'm a sucker for a good story, and I would have loved a bit more insight into what exactly provoked these riots. In all honesty, though, this games isn't really about the story...I thought the concept of the game was fun, simple. Get to one destination from another. All of the artwork was done the tried and true way: drawn by hand on paper. HAND DRAWN!!!Overall, if you like platformers with highly sensitive controls, you will love The Howler. On the other hand, if you’re easily frustrated with games in this genre, you may want to spend the money on something less confounding…like a nice book about political intrigue!"

First let me tell you what I like aboutThe Howler:+) Nice art style/OST/general concept:Overall it makes a good first impression. Hand drawn sprites and backgrounds combined with soothing music are the perfect way to start a short break. As for the concept: The game seems to promote a SF novel, so I guess it contributed to some degree.+) Hm...Well, that was short enough. So now the cons:-) Slow gameplay:You move your air balloon sideways by horizontally separated zones, which have different wind directions and/or forces. The problem is that even the strongest wind accelerates you very slowly. That might be realistic, but it doesn't help to get a good pace going. It's also the main reason, why it took me a whole hour to completeThe Howler, which brings me to my next point...-) Shortness of the levels:Normally I wouldn't mind with such a cheap game, but the levels are really, really short. Imagine the first level of Super Mario Bros being over once you get the first mushroom. That short.-) Indoor levels:It's a minority of the 16 levels, but frustrating enough for me to mention them. The main problem is, that some parts of the walls will pop your air balloon, while others won't. However the indicators (really small spikes) are often indistinguishable from the background. The only way to learn where they  are is through trial & error.But you know what? Those aren't the reasons why I don't recommendThe Howler.I love how Steam has a lot of good, free games and I think thatThe Howlerwould fit perfectly in this category. But unfortunately it isn't for free. That's why I don't recommend it. It may sound mean, but a game with the quality & quantity of content asThe Howler(AND which is also mainly promotional material for a book/capital city) just isn't worth the 1€ (or 50 cents in my case).Additional note:There are apparently a lot of people, who experience bugs/glitches with this game. Levels not loading, the balloon not reacting to voice steering, game crashes and so on. I played this game on a normal PC with mouse control and didn't experience any of them."

All you have to guide you is the wind.  Playing The Howler is all about learning to become one with the wind as you soar around this pastel world.  Its a simple concept for a game but it comes together quite well.  Its a short but sweet ride that should keep you entertained for just over an hour.The controls are super simple.  All you can do is increase the heat to ascend or subsequently release the hot air to descend.  By controlling the elevation you will pass through different zones of air blowing the wind this way and that way.  Certain currents will be stronger than other and you must be careful of the potential momentum of the stronger winds.  By straddling these currents you can proceed to your destination or pick up goods required for the different objectives.Many levels will simply have to going for one spot to another.  Other levels may have you pick up and deliver a package.  Later in the game you'll be given bombs you can drop.  Use these to destroy obstacles in your path or take out the enemy's bridge.  Just be careful not to be too close to your bombs as you can easily be sent floating off screen and into the abyss.One of the coolest parts of the game is the hand drawn art.  The backgrounds are gorgeous and rich with detail.  They distinguish themselves nicely from the sharp,clean, lines of the objects in the foreground.  There isn't much to the sound design.  There isn't any music while playing which could be justified to help you concentrate.  Usually all you hear is balloon's propane kicking in as you turn on the heat to ascend.  That being said the automatons and cars really stick out in the levels they're present.There really isn't much else to say.  This is a really simple game, one that doesn't take long to finish.  That isn't necessary a bad thing considering the low price point.  Not to mention there really isn't many other games like it.  The unique art style might make it worth considering if you're on edge.  As long as you're not expecting anything too fancy there is fun to be had playing The Howler."

The Howler is a very interesting game that utilizes hand done art in most, if not all, of its assets. Based on the book Hour of the Wolf, the game is set in an alternate steampunk version of Vilnius, Lithuania.The Howler has a lot going for it. It is a physics game where you utilize wind current to move a hot air balloon to its destination. The Howler also allows you to use your voice as a form of game control. The length of The Howler is quite short, and due to that it is difficult to gain all the Steam Trading Cards without leaving it running. I did have a few bugs with the window and fullscreen, but I am able to look past that. My biggest complaint of The Howler is the platform I played it on. This is a mobile game, ported to the computer. I believe, because of that, I could not get into this game. I did complete it, however I never had fun. There was something pulling me away the experience, and I think it is because I could have played it on my phone.That being said, I would advise you to try The Howler out, but not for full price. Preferably, you should pick up The Howler when the Art Appreciation Pack goes on sale.

Especially when it comes to wanting to remap certain keys that are to do with steam. Taking screenshots while you have a package or a bomb will instantly release them, interfering with your mission.Graphics/Art: All art used in the Howler was meticulously created by classically-trained painters. Most of the art was thanks to Rene Petruliene: all the graphic design was drawn by hand, giving it that extra classic, renaissance feel.Soundtrack: It ties in with the aesthetics of the game so well. It gives it that timely atmospheric feel that just works.Final Conclusion: Great, fairly short puzzler that will keep you entertained and frustrated depending on how good you are at controlling your air balloon. Also has a nifty unique feature of being able to control your flight with voice/sound from your headset which I quite enjoy because it keeps things interesting.Completing a mission will leave you feeling satisfied and accomplished, which for me is very rare.

,Recommended,306040,31052837,Posted: 9 April,all,« Ralph »,"This game features an interesting and unique art style that gives a warm, yet delightfully bleak impression due to its limited color palette of autumn colors. This wonderfully rich world is painted with a variety of shades, including earthly reds, moody oranges and warm bronze. In my opinion, the interesting choice of colour represents a particular time of day when winds are most calm to traverse along with a traditional autumn season.The culture of the narrative is represented mainly in it's architecture, which are presented as obstacles throughout the game. These buildings are very detailed and is clearly the work of a talented artist. Unfortunately, apart from on-screen text that shows the player's objective and motivations, the building's style is the only visual means of connecting the player to the game world. This isn't necessarily a bad thing for such a short, independent title, but it leaves a strong desire to dive deeper into it's limited narrative once all levels are completed.The game is almost entirely played with a single tap of a mouse or screen, with the exception of the spacebar. Despite it's simple mechanics, the gameplay can be very challenging at certain levels. Espically at the beginning of the game, where the pilot is tasked to fly beyond a collosal monstrosity of a howling wolf to retrieve a set of packages before returning to the glorious canine to descend into it's steel belly.The hour that you will typlically spend playing 'The Howler' will be an artisticaly inspirational and rewarding hour.

Doing this, puts the balloon in different ""zones"" of wind travelling in different directions and speeds (indicated by arrows on left of screen).  Using the wind to move around, the goal is simply to land at a particular location, and on some levels pickup a package/bomb or drop a package/bomb onto something before landing.  Simple idea and each level takes only a couple minutes to complete.There's15 campaign missions which I completed in exactly one hourand one unique bonus level good for another cool 5 minutes of play BUT you have to enter a password first.  The game tells you that the password is given to you by a tower, but then doesn't tell you on which of the 15 levels the tower is....uh...so instead of playing another hour, I just googled the password...the password is:SOSOverall:  It's a nice / pretty game for an hour, but there's really not much here.  7 out of 10."

The game's steampunk artstyle was alright closer up as in the walls or towers but the background almost seemed to fit in but then not at times. Speaking of witch the tall walls or towers have these little points on the sides of the obstacle that just blow up your hot air balloon instantly so watch out for those. Anyway I really did not like how the game was not capable for wider screens and leaves you with two dark as night borders at the ends of your screen which really does not go well with the background at all since it is mosly white or redish. Another point I do want to point out is that you can beat all of the levels in about two hours and in my opion The Howler not have a hole lot of replay value due to the fact that it only has fifteen levels (plus one more level if you know morse code) with no goal times to challenge the player.Even though i do not recommend The Howler it is worth checking out for just fourteen cents.

There's also a ""voice"" option where you can blow into your microphone instead of clicking the mouse, but that feels like more hot air than I really need for one game.The biggest lesson from The Howler is a hot air balloon is the worst vehicle for precision maneuvering.

With a hand-drawn art style that looks steampunkishThe Howler is simple: there is only one button to control: Click to make the balloon go up, do NOT click to make it drop. Different wind layers (of different strengths) means you will move left or right depending on the altitude. You move the balloon from launch pad to destination pad. As you work your way through the over a dozen missions (and there's a bit of a plot) you get complications, like more wind layers, requirement to pick up one or more cargo packs at an intermediate platform, and later, airborne obstacles that gets in your way. A light touch of your balloon against something is okay, heavier touch and your balloon goes POOF.The difficulty curve feels rather uneven. There's a mission at about halfway where you need to land the balloon, with 2 cargo boxes loaded, THROUGH the mouth of a statue (going at a diagonal). Somehow the balloon felt much more delicate. I made it once without the cargo, but can not make it with the cargo after over a dozen attempts.Still, as a simple and cheap game it does provide an interesting challenge."

Then I proceeded to desperately look for an ""Options"" button or else, just to annoyingly find out that the game has no option to set a lower sound volume; there's no way to regulate the output sound.At that point I was almost bleeding out from my ear canals... well sort of.Then, in a last attempt to regain consciousness, I looked for the ""Exit"" option so I could stop the unbearable loud noise, but to make things even worse, that option is also absent: no ""Quit"", ""Exit"", ""Quit to desktop"" nor similar alternative is present in the menus.

,Recommended,306040,22609973,"Posted: 24 April, 2016",all,srcleaves,"The game has a wonderful art style which is a combination of hand sketching and watercolor wash. The setting is steampunk and you play as a hotair balloon pilot. You have some control over the upward and downward motion of the balloon but you are at the mercy of the wind currents to move left and right. You will need to use momentum to navigate around obstacles, using the wind to your advantage and quickly changing elevation. The difficulty of the game ramps up quite quickly. On most levels (missions) you will be picking up and/or dropping parcels. There is a great deal of verticality in the game and often your destinations will be outside of your view. Each mission starts with a quick scan over the scene, but it will be up to you to remember where you need to go. You can control the game with your mouse and keyboard, but you can also control it with your voice. I tried this feature but found it less appealing than traditional controls. The game has a 4x3 aspect ratio and is locked at 30 FPS. I suspect this is due to it being available on iOS as well. Given how the level design works they would not have been able to simply expand the aspect ratio. This may be off-putting to some but the game can run in windowed mode so you won't notice any wasted space. In full screen you will have black bars on the sides. You cannot control the volume in the game, you'll have to rely on the system sound controls. This is probably another aspect of its iOS support.Overall I enjoyed my time with the game so far and I will play more of it. If you like to be in complete control of your ""character"" you may not enjoy this title since a lot of the time the control is out of your hands.If you'd like to see 20 minutes of my experience with the game check out my Twenty Minute Tryout video on YouTube...https://youtu.be/sdBid6_N7JM"

Think ""Flappy Bird"", not ""Kerbal SPace Program"".Wrong:The only thing that makes this a ""game"" (instead of a ""follow the arrows"" exercise) is that physics is twisted so that the balloon can gain momentum in one windstream, and when the balloon enters a different windstream, the balloon will briefly continue moving as though it were still in the first windstream. Neither Boyle, Bernoulli nor Newton would have approved this game-design decision. It's not how balloons work in air. And without this twist there is no game.Wrong:The player can hear the burn when the balloon is ordered to move upwards, suggesting a warm balloon filled with mostly Nitrogen and Carbon Dioxide. Yet the balloon detonates when it strikes an object, as thought the balloon were constructed of strike-anywhere matches and filled with hydrogen.Wrong:The balloon can go seemingly infinitely far off the map to the left, right, or bottom. But if it goes off the top of the map, it is ""lost"" and forces a restart. What, did it go into orbit? Doesn't the air on this planet get thinner with altitude?Wrong:No fuel meter, infinite burns are allowed. Fuel should have been the ""game"", and physics should have been real."

You pilot an unresponsive hot air balloon and have to get it to its destination by using the direction of the wind, which miraculously changes from left to right and back again depending on how high up you are. Oh and just to add a little bit of pointlessness to the mix, you sometimes pick up packages and drop them off at their destination.

I Haven't had time to fully get knee-deep into it, but from what i played, i have to say i like it, and want to play more when CS:GO isn't hogging all of my spare time.the basic premise is this: You are random Jonny No-Face piloting a hot-air balloon, and you have to steer it from A to B, maybe dropping off a package every once in a while. you can only control upward motion, relying on air currents to steer you left and right through this steam-punk-esque balloon adventure. so to progress, you have to put your balloon in a specific air current, all the while dodging buildings, hazards and fighting your own flawed sense of timing.the first few missions are rather easy, with them being simple tutorials to introduce you to mechanics. around level 5 is where the journey into keyboard-forcefully-lodged-in-monitor fury begins, as you have to continously thread the needle across this artistically-drawn cityscape.whilst all of the models up-front are really pretty, the background is simply a quick sketch of a cityscape, which brings down the overall quality. also the colour scheme is very drab, with browns and greys taking centre stage. which is fantastic around level 10, as it made me both clinically depressed and infuriated at the difficulty at the same time.eh, if you're bored and and too happy for your own good, get it. if not, go play doom or counter-strike or something less drab and difficultso counter-strike might not be a good idea either. pewdiepie's name and acompanying quote is plastered on the store page, which means he played it on his channel, so go whatch that for a better idea."

As far as I can tell, it is a pretty short game. I think I got about 40% done in about 15 minutes. I expect it to get harder. There is not much to say about the game, but here goes nothing.It is a short game about a hot air baloon. There is a minimalistic story which helps to add a bit of something to the game. The art is fairly nice and unique. It seems that this game has a function to work with a microphone. I did not try this. While it may be fun, I expect it to be less precise. The controls are pretty good. The baloon has to do various tasks, such as picking up cargo, dropping it off, and landing. There is only one control, and that is gas (makes the baloon go upwards). The wind currents indicated on the side of the screen indicate the direction and speed of wind. While it is incredibly simply, it probably gets pretty challenging. Really, this game reminds me just a bit of the old game Pilotwings for the super nintendo. It is all about precision. It is an enjoyable little game. It's worth buying on sale. Unless there is a second map of levels beyond the first 17 or so levels,  I would NOT recommend buying it at full price."

A few areas can be challenging, but for the most part it's not too difficult.  I do wish it were easier to tell which areas/walls destroy the balloon, and which areas just cause a ""bounce"" effect. Overall, I completed it in an hour. I purchased it for $0.50 on sale, so not many complaints in terms of content-to-cost ratio."

,Not Recommended,306040,19343600,"Posted: 28 November, 2015",all,Chef Excellence,"The Howler is a beautiful but whisper-thin sort of puzzle game that'll provide you with about an hour of entertainment. You pilot a balloon through a very nicely handpainted 2D representation of Vilnius, Lithuania, done up all steampunk-like. You press the mouse button to provide thrust which carries the balloon higher—steering is left up to the winds which're denoted on the side of the screen. Using those winds you steer around, over, and under obstacles and enemies to reach your goal, which always consists of picking up and/or dropping off items before plopping down on a landing pad elsewhere in the level.That's really it. Lunar Lander with some extra physics. There's a story attached involving impending riots and your efforts to stave them off supposedly taken from or relating in some way to the Lithuanian novelHour of the Wolf, but like the rest of the game it's pretty insubstantial.There's also an option to use your PC's microphone to control the balloon with your voice, which I didn't use at all. One, it feels like a bit of a gimmick which I don't consider to be either innovative or even essential to gameplay. If the voice commands were integrated into the experience in some way that made them inseperable—or even more effective than just clicking the mouse—I might take the concept seriously, but it seems more like the developer asking you to handicap yourself to make its game seem deeper than it really is. You can play Snake with a Dance Dance Revolution pad, but that doesn't make it innovative, it's still just Snake. Two, I have roommates.All that said the levels are well designed—occasionally cunningly so—and it is very well presented with lovely artwork and music, giving the game a cohesive style that kept me relatively engrossed for the 58 minutes it lasted.I picked this up for $0.49 during the Autumn Sale. For the cost of a game of pinball I suppose I have nothing to cry about. But it normally retails for $1.99, and there's simply not enough here to recommend even at that price."

This is the game to challenge your grandma who would otherwise never touch a videogame.

,Recommended,306040,22850836,"Posted: 7 May, 2016",all,ShandyAndy,"The HowlerThis review was last edited after I had completed the first 15 levelsShort ReviewA delightful game with beautiful, hand drawn graphics & simple game play that whilst only mildly challenging is fun to play none the less.Long ReviewThere is no tutorial but adequate hints are provided in the first few levels and the game play is so simple the lack of a tutorial is not an issue.The game is set in 2D with beautiful, hand drawn graphics. The game play is simple. You control a got air balloon that you must direct from one point to another, performing simple tasks like dropping off parcels along the way. The audio is restricted to sound effects which are fairly limited but effective.The controls are simple, for vertical control you press the left mouse button to ignite the hot air and raise and stop pressing it to allow gravity to take over. For left and right control you must rely on the wind direction and speed which varies at different altitudes and is indicated by an arrow on the left hand side; the number of feathers in the quill indicating the strength. Thus you need to be at the correct altitude to move in the correct direction. The SPACE BAR is used to drop objects you are carrying and there is a pause button click able by the mouse.You cannot pan around so you only see a screens worth of the level around the current location of the balloon. If you go too high, low, left or right and disappear off the edge of the level you die. Similarly if the balloon hits other objects you will usually die.As you progress through levels additional obstacles like floating bombs are introduced. Fortunately these move in a predictable manner.The only way to play is via a campaign of different screen levels you play in order (although once you have completed a level you can replay it at any time). The levels are pretty small (maybe twice the width of the monitor).When you start a new level you are quickly shown what needs to be done by the camera panning about and short text messages appearing. You have a set time limit to complete the tasks.This game play is short and the game can be easily be completed in 2-3 hours. Ignore my 17 hours game play - I left the game running in the start menu overnight by mistake.ProsBeautiful, hand drawn graphicsSimple game playConsThe sequence at the start of a level to show you what to do moves along a little fast for me to read all of the textMarks Out Of 55) Must have - stop whatever you're playing now and play this4) Worth the asking price and considering as your next purchase3) Maybe purchase if you're stuck for choosing your next game or mildly discounted2) Only purchase if it is heavily discounted1) Not worth getting even if given away freeWhere I got the game fromI have no idea how this game got into my Steam library but boy am I glad it did!Platform Played OnIntel Pentium G3258 Anniversary Edition, 8Gb RAM, Palit GTX 750, Windows 10, EasyAcc Mouse and Steelseries Merc keyboardMy best guess for a  PEGI Rating3: I can't see any reason to raise it above this.PEGI Ratings"

Only by the sheer amount of detail, you know that those guys who did this, really poured their hearts into it. And once again for the painters wow. 9/10Music - Deep and mysterious, it just adds to the whole aesthetic to the game, which itself is deep and mysterious. 7/10Story - Couldn't quite understand the story, because it is mostly given to you by little chunks of story, at the start of every level. That is probably done to not spoil the book it is based of off/on, yes you heard right, a book. ''Hour of the Wolf'' by Andrius B. Tapinas. (Now I don't know, if I can post links which are not directly connected to steam, I may be mistaken) You can find the book on Amazon, for a pretty cheap price I might add. (The score is based on playing only the GAME, it may change when I get and read the book.) 5/10Content - A few levels, but as you progress through the game, more and more mechanics are unlocked, which make every single new level, something new to be experienced. 7/10Controls - Done by the mouse or your own voice, or any sound that you make, be that bashing your head on the desk (don't do that) or by breaking every single bone in your body (or that). Press and hold to go up, let go to go down or scream to go up, don't scream to go down. Just by having the option of using sound as a way to control the game, it gets an easy 8/10.Gameplay - Simple, but effective. Also well paced, but I do warn you, some levels need a little bit more thinking to get through. Remember, if what you are doing does not work, try and think of a solution, rather than raging. Also I have a little pro tip for the game, to stop getting your blump to go up from the sound, just unplug your microphone. I know genius. 7/10A really well made game. Bonus points for making the game small, which in contrast makes the players want to read the book, to understand the story, really well thought out. Also I do encourage people who liked the game, to give the book a try, this is not from a person who has read the book, but from a person who will most definitely read it. Also on a side note, it does not hurt to read overall.Final Score: 7.2/10"

Though there are some miniscule bits of sloppyness, the art seems to work well with the movement of the game. I got the game in a bundle for VERY cheap (around 3 games with similar quality to this one for $.50). It is a reletively short game though, with about a 2 hour playthrough time and a bonus level that requires a passcode from a previous level in the game. Some of the levels can seem to be a bit tedious at times, but it wasn't anything to get too frustrated over. Gameplay-wise, it is a very simple concept that hasn't really been exercised in many other games as a main mechanic. it also has trading cards which, in my case, literally made the game pay for itself. For how cheap it was, i would have bought it even if it didn't have cards. However, i don't know if i would have bought it for it's full price, so if you're looking to get this game, i would reccomend adding it to your wishlist so you know when it's on sale, and buy it then."

So far, the first two games just show artistic promise while having actual gameplay about as bad as trying to walk with tent poles for legs.The Howler (odd enough name, as the actual Howler is only in the first level), revolves around a city being thrust into madness... oh, you can't tell? The level design doesn't imply that? Yeah, see that's the big issue with games that rely on cutscenes or text to simply TELL you what's going on and not backing it up. It's like getting ready for a dinner party, and your friend tells you, ""Hey! Get ready! This is really high society. Act your best!"" And when you get in, dressed in your tuxedo, the place is actually a hillbilly hoedown. The world of The Howler feels very empty and lifeless, rather than tense and on the brink of destruction, like the so-called ""story"" would imply.I have some humongous problems with the gameplay (very similarly to Gravilon), being that momentum is NOT a good mechanic for a video game. It's simply too much of a semi-controllable variable that makes beating levels feel more like you got lucky rather than actually feeling like you accomplished and learned something. So many of these levels are agonizingly hard because of how semi-predictable the movement of your hot air balloon is.The world is designed just fine. I have no issues with it, visually. It certainly looks a lot more vivid than Gravilon, but again the design makes a lot of obstacles much harder than they are. Such as building up momentum to get over a fair-sized chimney proved to be a right pain in my a** after attempting the level about 15 times.If you like momentum games, and a decent challenge, The Howler will shortly satiate your starvation. But as for people looking for actual ""art""... I suggest you look over by Dear Esther or Elegy for a Dead World. There's very little art around here."

You will have a wind speed level which you will have to care and think about. The game is very simple and short. You have to fly over buildings and other obstactles and reach the exit. Some levels require special attention before you are able to finish the level. Like picking up a parcel and deposit on the required location.There are 15 levels + 1 bonus level. Each level could be completed within 2 minutes.For a single buck the game price seems reasonable.I find the game very boring.Graphic Art are pretty decent.No Gallery.Other things.Pressing ESC will minimize your screen and i haven't found a way to make it fullscreen.There is a microphone action in the game(so if u talk something happends).

Furthermore, i've noticed how the game is a cross-ad for A.Tapinas' book Hour of the wolf, that shares it's name with a swedish horror drama that i enjoyed far more than this game and the book combined.Pros and cons+ Gorgeus artstyle+ Decent soundtrack+- Simple concept- Frustratingly difficult due to poor level design- Poorly optimized for screens wider than those of smartphones, resulting in low res, or the game being displayed in a small cube, with black outlines taking up most of the space, letting the player believe, that the game is in""fullscreen""- Short* Useless functions/alternative controls like voice command, which are nowhere close to being precise enough for the game's sadistic needs.Vistiek norėčiau padėkot kūrėjam, kad skyrė laiko šiam projektui, nes visgi, kaip pirmas blynas, neturint patirties žaidimų kūrimo sferoje, tikrai ne baisiai prisvilęs."

Hard to believe it was all drawn by hand. The music also sets the mood. Overall it was a challenging game to play."
