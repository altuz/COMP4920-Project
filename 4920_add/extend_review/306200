It's a bit shallow and a lot of the options like where you build things are fixed. Your path of growth is more or less laid out for you.The graphics, however, are quite nice and the characters are adorable. The atmosphere and lack of urgency is relaxing. It's, in every sense of the word, a casual game. It's also a gentle introduction to city-building for someone who has never played one before and isn't sure they want to drop $10-20 on one of the more genre-defining titles. Like I mentioned before, the city-building aspect is rather limited, but it's quaint.You get what you pay for and it's not a bad game to add to your collection."

Not because the game is bad, it's not great, it is a fun casual strategy game, but it was a disappointment because it was a downgrade from a previous Alawar/Buka Entertainment game.The Promised Land is a previous game from Alawar/Buka that was released in 2012, it was a game that I really enjoyed for what it was.  With this game I was hoping for more of the same but maybe a bit bigger of a scale or maybe with some more depth.  The Happy Hereafter however seems to be a downgrade on The Promised Land rather than improving on the formula that made me a fan .  For this review I'll touch on a few of the points that I felt really soured me on this game compared to the one that made me buy this game.So the game is about starting off a colony, managing the workers that you have to finish tasks given to you so you can upgrade your buildings and continue progressing.  Right off the start the worker system showed a big downgrade from the previous game.  The workers are all generic and it doesn't matter what each one is doing, in The Promised Land, each character had a description, stats and preferred job(as well as disliked job).  Each worker in The Happy Hereafter is interchangeable, it doesn't matter what job each is doing and you can just throw them wherever and it doesn't make much difference.  In The Promised Land you had to plan out where each new worker went and what the best fit was to maximize their ability to collect resources and perform the best for your colony.  Each worker in The Promised Land could also gain experience making them better at certain tasks which again added depth in worker placement.  Workers could also be stationed in one area and they would continually work that area and if they ran out of resources they would patiently wait till resources spawned again.  In The Happy Hereafter if a worker tries to collect resources from a depleted area they will just wander back to town and if you didn't notice it (there is a pumpkin head character they hide behind) then you have an idle working doing nothing.  And lastly on the workers,  You can not assign more than one worker to collect resources from an area other than the very last resource you can collect, it really prevents you from progressing and puts you in a situation you don't need as many workers as you could have space for as most of them will stand around doing nothing.There isn't really as much story as The Promised Land either, there wasn't much in The Promised Land either to be fair but again something lacking in this title.Art is great in both games, again not much of difference or upgrade, but it's not terrible and is nice to look at.  It was pretty good in their previous game so why mess with it.There is also random enemies that will try to pillage your storage area.  These are more annoying then fun to deal with.  They are also incredibly easy to deal with and pose no real threat, a couple of clicks and your back to the game.The resources in the game for building and upgrading as well seem to be poorly balanced.  I had max workers on all areas to collect as much wood as possible and I was still constantly running out of wood, while having large stock piles of food, stone and gold (as well as other resources).  This could have been an easy fix by allowing more than one worker to collect resources from the mill, instead I had to constantly micromanage the workers to have one collecting while another was delivering.  As much as that might seem like it ads some difficulty or complexity, for me it just seemed tedious and takes away from the fun of these types of games.To sum it all up, The Promised Land is 3$ more on steam, but you'll get a lot more out of that game compared to this one.  If you are looking for a short, casual, indie resource collection, strategy game, I would suggest The Promised Land over this game.  If you already have The Promised Land and you are looking for something very similar or better, skip this game entirely as I just didn't find it be near the quality or fun that The Promised Land was."

Basically the player builds a city for their zombies friends by setting the zombies to work, gathering food, farming, cutting wood, quarrying stone, and collecting gems and money.  The point is upgrade everything, when everything is upgraded the game ""ends"".  There are a few quests that need to be done such as helping a witch or growing a tree.  It is a bit involved since to make money one needs to use the laboratory, workshop, and kitchen.  And while managing all that the main warehouse gets attacked periodically by flying pigs, shining knights and grim reapers who steal the food.  The player must defend the main warehouse by clicking on the thieves until all have been defeated. (Flying red pigs with a black mane that remind me of Monty Python's flying pigs.)Best thing about this game besides the lack of any time limits, is that it is more or less an open type world where the player controls who and what is being done.  Plus the town square can be built however the player choses by buying street lamps, paving stones, fountain, and benches.A simple easy game for when one wants a break from time/resource management games with timed linear fixed campaign levels."

The artwork is good, the characters are cute, even the town looks cute.  The gameplay was also smooth.  Things worked the way I thought they would the first time through, there were no crashes or hang up.

76561198017196792,Recommended,306200,32703784,Posted: 23 June,all,MiMi,"The Happy Hereafter is a casual strategy game. You manage the underworld and the poor souls who will become your slaves, err your workers. The aim of the game is to discover the entire map by unlocking all the areas, interact with some wacky NPCs quest givers, grab all the resources, build everything you can and upgrade it to the max. It’s a tiny persistent world, i.e. there aren’t several levels with different maps, you have one big map.It’s a casual game so there’s no time pressure, you’re never stuck wondering what to do next as the game keeps throwing small tasks at you and can’t even choose where to build anything: everything have an already set place. The gameplay is how efficiently you’ll exploit all your resources and plan your crafting to do all the quests and finish the game. When you finish you can still keep on playing your little world if you want to.It lasted around 6 hours and had a bit of complexity with the craft: you can produce several different food items, use them in a dozen cooking recipes; you also pick wood and stones and craft statues and other gift shop goodies. You can sell anything you pick or craft using a trading post and use your money to buy additional workers.Expecting a trash game I was surprised by the overall quality. The graphics are nice, with a Tim Burton style. The music is calm and fitting, a bit eerie. The texts are fun to read and some quests made me chuckle. The game is pleasant and really well made and if you’re a fan of casual lighthearted fun, you shouldn’t miss it. Especially now since the game is on sale at a ridiculous price!Similar games: the Virtual Villagers games, Wild Tribe, The Island Castaway games, Gemini Lost, Farm Tribe, Wandering Willows… And to some extent All My Gods and Hero of the Kingdom games."
,Not Recommended,306200,12310054,"Posted: 30 September, 2014",all,Mad Hatter,"The Happy Hereafter is essentially Virtual Villagers - Lite set in Halloween Town.  Don't get me wrong, it's a good game on its own.  But there are a few lacking components and bugs that make it not as impressive as other similar titles in the genre.For starters, it's incredibly short.  So short, that I finished it in two nights.  If you follow the quest order you can probably get another hour or so out of it, but that isn't a good thing.  There are a lot of stretches of time where you're doing nothing but waiting.  It certainly isn't as long or as tedious as Facebook games, but it lacks item collection or achievements like Virtual Villagers to help pass the time.  If I had known from the start to improve resource gathering facilities the second the tech was available, I probably could have shaved off almost another hour of play.Second, the bugs.  And there are more than a few that can be annoying, if not progress slowing.  On occasion there are times where villagers stop gathering from resources at the bottom of the map.  While it makes sense for them to stop gathering when a resource has run dry and is in the process of regenerating, they don't always stop for this reason.  I found myself at the start of the game constantly having to reassign someone to harvest wood at trees because they just decided to stop working after collecting one load.  With a little luck I was able to get them to automatically harvest, as they are supposed to, but it did get annoying and tedious, especially at the start when you are entirely reliant on these nodes for resources.Another bug that is annoying, but not game breaking in any way, re units sliding around or getting stuck on decorations.  Sometimes when you tell a unit to harvest something, it will show the gathering animation but they will slide all the way back to the town square.  This doesn't prevent them from completing their job, but it is annoying.  Also, idle units have a habit of getting stuck under things.  Benches, lights, buildings.  It is easily fixed by picking them up and telling them to do something, and doesn't harm your production since they were idle, but it is another minor annoyance that one would think could be easily fixed.The characters are interesting and it's obvious that a great deal of effort was put into their creation, but they are sadly under-utilized.  Each character has one, maybe two quest chains, that are incredibly short, and then they are never used again.  The mermaid has I think 3 or 4 quests, spread across two ""chains.""  I say ""chains"" simply because the first chain has 2-3 quests for her and the second is a single quest given by the witch.  Once completed you will never see her again.  It's sad to see detailed characters and environments used so sparingly.Ultimately, I have to say this game is a ""Pass.""  While it can be fun, for its length, bugs, and simple play-style, there are just better games of the same genre.  At sale price, it was a nice distraction; at full price it would still be ok, but for a few dollars more you can get similar games with more depth and over-all entertainment."

Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. The visual and audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu.GameplayThe Happy Hereafter is an strategy simulation game. Where the individual can control the actions of their workers by assigning them certain task[s] to carry out like gathering resources from the environment around them. All the while maintaining their happiness that max level.There are plenty of colorful and zangy characters to meet in the game. Some of them do have quests that needs to be fulfill.There are plenty of artifacts to find and collect around the environment. Some of them can be easily found right away.The building plans are locked because they're connected to the quests that given out by characters. They can be used to build new buildings in the environment. When building a structure it'll take some time. However, it can go much faster, only if add another worker to speed up the building process. [This same strategy can be applied to clearing away the garbage from roads and such.] The newly built buildings can be upgraded as long as the required item[s] are found.There are two ways of scroll (""Click & Drag"" and ""Edge"") in the game. There's little and/or no mouse control for ""Edge"" scrolling. There's plenty of mouse control for ""Click & Drag"" scrolling. I prefer ""Click & Drag"" scrolling it makes everything a bit easier.MiscellaneousThere are total of five different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam’s Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it’s Booster Pack Creator. Badge can be crafted and upgraded with these trading cards. This feature is only available for Steam’s version of this game.Final thoughts, I definitely enjoying playing this game all the way through to the end. As for the replay value I would say it's low.

,Recommended,306200,11539613,"Posted: 3 August, 2014",all,Arlith,"Bought this at full price, a whopping $3.99 (US dollars) which is less than popcorn at the movies. I didn't really expect much and thought it'd be a very mediocre, forgettable, indie game.I'm so glad I was wrong.The Good:  It looks like a handpainted style game with a more cartoonish flair, and it's got a very cute whimsical soundtrack to go with it (the music that plays in the game, to clarify).  I love the fact that it has quests/missions in the first place, and they never make you feel too rushed but give you enough pressure so that you want to hurry up with whatever needs doing. The quests are worded in a very quirky style and made me chuckle a few times! I loved the fact that there were cutscenes within the game and they varied from traditional style cutescenes to an image artsy style cutscene, almost like a graphic novel. You start with 3 little ""helpers"" and it goes from there, depending on your resourcefulness and needs, and by the you can have many more, each working on permanent jobs or temporary ones. I like that you can always reassign who does what and when. And lastly, you NEVER have to save (omg what!). That's right, you can exit whenever you feel like it or whenever you draw parent aggro (girlfriend, boyfriend, wife, hubby aggro!), and when you log back into the game it starts exactly where you left off. Wish more games did that, instead of the runaround some games do to try and never let you exit their games. Yes, I'm looking at you Assassin's Creed. Also, there is a vendor system in place, where you can sell and buy. Comes in handy!The Bad: bugs! Now, I only encoutered 2.5 bugs. One was when I first started the game, I was not able to use magic on an altar. I simply restared the game twice and never encountered this problem again. The second bug was when I was dragging a worker to a location, I got a popup tutorial (I had not ticked tutorial off at this point) and my worker disappeared from my screen! Turns out she ended up on a ""dark"" undiscovered part of the map. I got her back when I discovered the area, but it did take me a while to get there. And the 0.5 bug was more of a glitch ""oversight"" on the developers part. One of the components for building crystal houses is listed as ""stones"" but instead requires ""gems"". I was trying to upgrade my houses to a rank 2 but was unable to, I had plenty of stone, so I bought from gems from the trade post and sure enough I was able to upgrade to rank 3. Now the last bad thing, is the length of gameplay. It's short (about 6 hours) if you are playing to do the missions/quests, however, once you beat the game you have the option to keep playing.Worth it? In my humble opinion, I would recommend anyone to buy this game. While it is short compared to most games out there it's got a lot of replayability, the game keeps you engaged and interested, and you can tell the devs put a lot of hard work into the game, so quality is on your side! Plus, at 4 bucks (3.99 US dollars) you can afford you buy it and hate it, but you will probably like this one. Hope you guys enjoyed it as well!"
,Not Recommended,306200,23232114,"Posted: 27 May, 2016",all,Lin,"Let's keep this simple: This is a resource management game on training wheels. For a younger audience, this could potentially be recommended, with caveats - but that doesn't make it a good game in the genre.Developer Alawar and publisher Buka Entertainment are well known amongst casual gamers. Farm Frenzy and Treasures of Montezuma are two of the most well known series they've worked on, and the rest of their respective lists of mostly mediocre yet decent enough games are pretty long. They also collaborated on The Promised Land, another resource management game, but one I actually enjoyed; it was *heavily* reminiscent of Virtual Villagers, and even without ever managing to come close to the fun mechanics and attention to detail that made Last Day of Work's game a hit, it provided a few hours of entertainment.The Happy Herefter feels like a game that attempts to capitalize on the moderate success of The Promised Land, and fails. There is nothing innovative about the resource collecting, building, crafting, quest fullfilling treadmill the game puts you on, and there is also no attempt at permitting the player any input or attempt at strategy. You follow the cues, you fullfill one (re)quest after an other, everything with an arrow pointing at things just in case you missed them. Except when you do miss them, because quests are worded awkwardly or mechanics are insufficiently explained. Certain mechanics also feel too much like busywork to be fun, like resources that deplete very fast but only for a few seconds - long enough for your toons to wander aimlessly around not knowing what to do and needing to be dragged back. There is a distinct lack of polish here, in the copywriting, in the UI, and in the mechanics, to the extent where it feels like no one really playtested this game.So if you have younger kids, and if you are willing to sit around for a few hours helping them when they get stuck because something is worded wrong/awkwardly or a mechanic is badly explained, then this might be a fun game for them. It's utterly linear, impossible to go wrong, somewhat cute, with a silly story, and not too long. If on the other hand you're an adult casual gamer, might I suggest The Promised Land? Exactly in the same vein, just better executed and more polished."
,Recommended,306200,30810156,Posted: 29 March,all,KDD!^agof,"It is a casual version of a city-building genre with predetermined buildings placements and almost none negative events to take care of. And the art design is great and coherent in the ""cutesy-undead"" style.Downsides being, that it has only one map, which eliminates repetition of high-player-agency early game, where most city-planning happens, unlike later-game fine-tuning. And considering that all placements are uncustomizable it's better that way. You can chain games in this sub-genre one after another, pretending that you play different levels, while having new aesthetics every time. And the problem with the mid-game is that even with all upgrades, resource gathering is too slow and you just waiting with nothing else (like fighting fires, crime or epidemics) to do. Next is the story — you are just start doing stuff and don't know why, nor do you know who or what attacks your town. Speaking of which, defense is not only mechanically pointless, but even lacks any feedback, like your godhand throwing lightnings or something into enemies.It kind of works with UWS UHD Surround, but GUI scaling hides important parts of the map from the player, so it's better to just play it windowed.Overall it's a one nice and pleasant feelgood playing session of several hours with podcasts or youtube videos on second (fifth) screen."

If the bug were to be fixed (which, according to the sources I've checked, it's been in existence and been reported for two years so I doubt it ever will be) I'd highly recommend as a cute, relaxing game, but until that happens, it's just enormously disappointing."

Occasionally, you get attacked, which mainly means clicking on the attackers, that come in 3 forms, always in the same numbers, and always from the same directions. You also get warnings prior to the attacks, so that they merely become a distraction rather than an interesting mini-game.ProSound and graphics fit the spooky theme.No bugs, a decent mobile port.ConI know it's a casual game, but it's far too simple, no challenge.Very short (compared to the dev's other game ""The Promised Land."")Minions have to be micro-managed and dragged to certain jobs.The game ends abruptly with ""The End"" on a black screen leaving you wondering what the goal was ....Much of the map feels undeveloped with empty areas never used.Overall, if you haven't played The Promised Land, this might be worth checking out, as it really feels as if this is the training wheels for that game.

,Recommended,306200,33703529,Posted: 21 July,all,ephy,"A time and supply management game in the vein of Build-A-Lot, but with more resources.You are an overlord in an afterlife community with many ruins lying about the map. These ruins must be rebuilt into their original structures. (No freedom of placement here, as with traditional city-builders.) At first, you have extremely limited space for food, resources, and money, as well as a limited amount of resources on the map (although the nodes do replenish over time). The game doesn't tell you this, but as you rebuild resource structures, you can place a worker there to start generating resources for your warehouse. As you upgrade your warehouse, you can hold more supplies and gold (up to 900).It took a little bit for me to realise that you can grab your workers from the worker list in the bottom left and drop them where you want (go to that location first, then select a free worker). Once I figured that out, management was easier.One issue: there is a quest near the end of the game that requires you to sell wood to the Capital. There is no resource known as 'wood'.You will need to send *planks*, crafted in the workshop.Pros:+ trading cards!+ cute graphics.+ windowed mode.+ simple gameplay.+ always something to do.Cons:- short.- the worker list is just a forward-and-back 'list', not a whole list.- no achievements.- no reply value.EphyRating: 7/10Summary: It's a typical, casual time management game.

You also need to manage your own 'mana' to repel raiders and entertain your workers.  There is some spotting of objects scattered over the map but not much is made of this.The map is small and building placement pre-determined.  There is a constant stream of directions from your 'assistant' which ensures no-one can ever get stuck with this game.  The instructions are not imo optimised - so you can ignore them and construct/upgrade available buildings as seems best to you - you will get the building reward eventually and the game doesn't quite run on rails.And there is a very naughty leprechaun...."

Don't buy this game unless you are willing to wait for extended periods of time without much action.My mother had a Farmville addiction that was tearing the family apart.Thankfully, she's moved on. Unfortunately, she's moved on to all the other facebook games.I needed a cute little game to keep mother away from the facebooks, so I got this during the Halloween sale.I wanted to test it out a bit before placing my laptop in front of my mother, so I decided to play for a few minutes.Hours later, I ALMOST regret having started to play this game.What at first had seemed like harmless fun has turned into a great part of my day that I cannot remember except for sparse moments of lucidity where I recall sitting in front of my computer yelling at little zombies to work faster.This game is addicting, but not very fulfilling.STORY:There isn't much of a story, just enough to keep you from questioning why on earth you're sitting in front of a computer waiting for a little undead girl in an adorable dress to mine ore to build a house in a world that doesn't even exist.ART:The art is ADORABLE. Aside from the dopamine release when a project was completed, it was the art that kept me going until the end.PACING:The quests are appropriately paced to keep one interested throughout nearly the whole game, but they really start to lag towards the end.This is an issue when you realize that the game will ONLY properly run in FULL SCREEN mode.BUGS:Speaking of properly running, the little worker zombie positively don't. In the beginning, while there are only a few zombies, the little fellows walk and work happily. However, after about a dozen or so, issues start to happen and you have a bunch of workers not working because they're stuck in between objects. This is easily remedied by clicking on them and placing them elsewhere, but it gets out-of-hand towards the end.Buy this game if you like to make questionable choices with less than rewarding results!"

And yet, this game manages to crash every 5 minutes.This game is just a casual grinder. The story, from what I could play, is mediocre at best. The art, however, is cute and well done."

It doesn't have much of a replay value though.I myself completed it in less than 5 hours, and I got everything there was.I do hope that they add more maps, maybe even some random generation, achievements, maybe some in game rewards to use in other maps and maybe even more stuff. Then it might get more replay value."
,Recommended,306200,12766262,"Posted: 3 November, 2014",all,Sienical,"It's similar to Ravenwood Fair and other such games to be found on Facebook, but without the game constantly asking you to pay for extras, which is a plus.There are no Steam achievements (yet?), so you also don't have to rely on the internet in any way.It's very linear; you can't even choose where to build your houses, which means the replay value is very low as every playthrough will be exactly the same.But it's still a good way to spend a few brainless hours, so if you're looking for something simple for the holidays (or for after a stressful workday) then this should do the trick."

I'm still waiting for a patch... the game is really fun, charming, a little slow, but a good one, but after you reach LEVEL 3, the mayor bug will strike, and yet there is no solution for that. If you complete the tasks in a different order than you get them, the 'UPGRADE' buttons on the building will crash to be forever inactive. No forums can help and the developer's only advice: contact the support... I could love the game but this bug ruins all my hours I've spent on it. 5/10"

This one looks a bit more fancy but it always bugs out when I play causing workers to just walk in place or drift across the map while working. Would recommend this game if not for the bugs though.
