It's a simulator based on simulating one thing, controlling the PATH train. There actually is a career mode, but it's not in the sense of career mode most people are used to. It's called 'Shift Duty' in this case. You can play any time-table of which I'd assume was the PATH schedule back in that day with three different types of cars. The camera angles are limited but, hey, it's a simulator, you're suppose to be driving a train, not go ape♥♥♥♥♥♥wanting to view the doors open from the outside, you're suppose to be in the cab; plain and simple.I must admit though, the game is definitely not worth the $19.99 at this day in age. They do have other versions, not sure if released on Steam though, Vol 2 in Berlin and Vol 3 in London I believe. They also have a Vol 4 coming that would feature the (7) line in NYC.By the way, I'm using Windows 8.1 Pro with no issues of crashing like other users are experiencing.Plain and simple, if you want a pure simulator operating a train and just doing that, go for it. If you want to only view the trains from exterior views and have fun watching doors open from the outside, this train simulator may not be for you.Just remember, this game came out in '09. Not '14."
,Recommended,306370,13891440,"Posted: 8 January, 2015",all,(TTRR) TwoTrak (FC&N),"World of Subway's 1 - The Path, is a game which is not for the hardcore train simulation fan's, some may like it, some may not, but in my opinion, it saves a spot in my book.So when you get the game for the very first time, you can see that the menu is very basic and plain, but remember this is a game which came out in 2009, not 2015.When you choose the timetable, the type of train you have selected and the location, the loading time takes about 10-15 seconds, so you dont have to complain about the time it takes to load.Then you come to the one big downside of the the game which really ticked me off, when you get into the subway train for the first time, some of the controls are unbinded on the train itself which is annoying, so your going to have to go to the options menu and bind all the train controls that way.The other thing that people may not like is the graphics, there very Mircosoft Train Simulator like, which doesn't bother me at all and the next downside to the game is the intercom voice when you arrive and depart every station, this can be also very annoying when your trying to drive.The controls on the train are hard to master, but once you know and get used to the brake, reverser and everything else on the train, it can be easier once you do get used to the train controls.So my final verdict is that this is not for hardcore train sim fan's, it's plain, simple, easy and fun, but If you are looking for a challenge, I should recommend World of Subways Vol. 3 - London Underground Circle Line, it has much more of a realistic like physics engine and you can get in and out in the train!  Which is a pretty sweet feature.I recommend World of Subway's 1 - The Path for newcomers to train simulation, remember the controls are hard but you can bind them to whatever key you want on your keyboard, so it can be a bit easy for you."

76561198059744477,Recommended,306370,31403307,Posted: 27 April,all,jtrainman94,"It's an okay product for $10. It's cool if you want to experience something different other than Train Simulator. Yeah some of the scenery is inaccurate and there's bugs galore, but what do you expect for a $10 game? The only severe issues I've encountered so far is that there is no tutorial mode for new players, none of the important buttons and levers (throttle, brake, etc) are mapped meaning first time users will have to manually map the buttons themselves, and the biggest problem is that the game crashes whenever you attempt to change the graphics settings. I don't mean crashing in game because you jacked the graphics to max settings, I mean you change the settings in the menu, hit ""OK"" to save it, the game crashes, and none of your changes are saved, meaning the game is perpetually stuck at the default graphics settings. I'll keep this game and play it as is because it was cheap and it's the only real simulation of the PATH line out there. However if the game cost any more than the current price, I'd be pretty unsatisfied. If you have experience with train sims and want a little something different, go ahead and get it. But if you're looking for something serious, pass this game up and get Train Simulator."

76561198007258637,Recommended,306370,15280457,"Posted: 9 April, 2015",all,DR GOO,"This certainly has a charm, and I really like the game. Yes, it's quite old but the graphics are what I expected, but surprisingly good. I love the Manhattan backdrop (pity it isn't HD) but it does give you that immersion driving the train in the open.I was also happy I discovered at least partial XBox360 controller function, admittedly the analogue sticks and triggers don't work, but you can map the trains main functions to the buttons.You will need to assign some of the keyboard commands, such as the announcements and you can switch to the mouse for the added look around, so basically for the price, and functionality and just charm I am happy with this little game.One thing though, it's such a pity you cannot move the UI which just bunches itself in your view. Being able to move the sections within the screen would have been good, as I just turn them all off once I set the destination.This game allows me to relax, it's small enough to do a few runs without losing interest, and I even crack a few smiles at the voice overs for the announcer who sounds like he has a rather nasty cold.You can max out everything and even force FXAA from nVidia's CP for added look and feel.I hope the devs revisit New York and a big thanks to them for daring to develop a game as I guess a very small team with the C4 engine.I will definitely make the leap to WoS 4 (Line7) and look forward to more great innovative developments in the future.I did suffer pink/black graphic anomalies, but unchecking fullscreen seems to have fixed that, and as a note to anyone reading this, even with fullscreen unchecked and the game running in windowed mode, it's only the main GUI that is windowed and once you start a shift, or take a route, the gameplay is in fullscreen, albeit with the windows taskbar, which is forgivable.Big thumbs up."

,Not Recommended,306370,12811271,"Posted: 5 November, 2014",all,OvenBaked,"If you've ever played Train Simulator 2015, prepare to take a step down in terms of interface and controls and general functionality of the game.I would say the price is a little high, perhaps $9.95 (US) would have been more appropriate than $19.95.The camera controls are basic, there's no zoom, FOV or adjustment of exterior camera. You can't open the train doors unless the camera view is in the driver's cabin, so you can't see the doors opening and closing, or passengers boarding.It's a very basic sim, there's no career mode or any of the usual things you find in  games. It has an indie ""pet project"" feel about it for sure!It might appeal to someone who is familiar with this actual line in real life. If you've lived in NY, this sim might be interesting, but even then it's still niche.Train Simulator 2015 has an excellent feature where you can move the camera from the front to the back outside the train, and zoom in and out and around, and still maintain control of the train. World of Subways has nothing like that. TS 2015 is a lot more expensive though, so the comparison isn't entirely fair. But now you know what you're in for."

,Recommended,306370,21733499,"Posted: 9 March, 2016",all,DeanGeddes,"I'd like to start by mentioning that this actually a really good game. Yes, it has a few bugs here and there but at least it is still playable. For such a reasonable price, this is a good game. Remember, it came out in 2009 so we can't expect anything special. But for 2009, it actually has quite good graphics. The PATH route is quite a nice length, not too long and not too short. You can get a shift over, within about half an hour. The graphics inside the tunnels are excellent, especially the dynamic lighting that lights up the cab as you drive along. Above ground, the graphics aren't all that, but I really like the detail on the track and the signals are very bright which means you can see them from a long way off. When driving east above ground you can also see the Manhattan skyline, which I find a very nice touch to the game. In stations, you can enter free roam mode which allows you to explore. However, there is a very annoying platform bug which means that if you accidentally walk off the edge of a platform, it is impossible for you to get back up again. Therefore, you have no choice but to end the mission and start all over again. The people on the platform are static but for a 2009 game, we can't really complain. There are about three trains that you can choose from, but they all seem to be exactly the same inside the cab, so it doesn't really make any difference. Something that can be really annoying when driving is that you have to control the announcements manually by pressing keys. This can get quite boring. The station graphics could be a touch better but they are not too bad either. Another thing, is that you have to manually configure all the keys before you drive. There is no tutorial, so I guess you are just expected to learn yourself. The speed limits in the game are also very harsh. They can just change at any time. You could be just driving along at 40mph and then you notice that the limit has changed to 15mph, with a tight curve approaching. A major disappointment was that there is no speedometer inside the cab. You have to totally rely on the route monitor screen. Tight curves can also derail the train, if you are not paying attention to the speed restrictions. There are AI trains in the game, but you can only see them when you are above ground, and not in underground stations.Overall, I rate this game 7.5/10. It has some very nice features and but also some really annoying bugs. But for such a cheap price, I'd say it is worth buying and it doesn't require a high spec pc to run either, although I strongly recommend you check the minimum requirements first, just in case."

I bought this game on discount without big enthiusiasm but suprisingly it's quite good as for it's time. The line is very interesting. Built more than 100 years ago to connect New York with New Jersey. You can really feel these old claustrophobic tunnels with sharp curves and a lot of speed limits. You have multiple choices for your journey so you won't get borred that quickly. There is no real career mode but if you wish you can make a whole day shift. As for realism I don't think it is very high - the breaking seems a bit too easy, but it's not bad either. Your train will speed up downhill and you can derail it. It's a good simulator especially if your CPU is not the newest one. A bit puzzling is the fact that you have no real speedometer on board. You will need some experience to comply with the limits (you can use a track monitor though which gives you the speed but it is considered a bit of a cheat). The manual says there are some random events implemented (like a man walking inside the tunnel) but I haven't encountered any yet.I can't stop playing.
