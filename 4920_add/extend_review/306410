76561198045208825,Not Recommended,306410,18417358,"Posted: 10 October, 2015",all,Shatiz,"SummaryA very poor HOG game with little to no redeeming factors. Buy at your own risk.ReviewThere is very little good to say about Crystals of Time. The soundtrack is pretty nice, but extremely limited, often stopping for minutes of a time leaving you in silence. The story is pretty much non-existent and the characters uninteresting.The worst part is the gameplay and the presentation however as the game is littered with horrible design decisions. The area is very open with many rooms to explore and return to. Unfortunately, the areas that need items are often very vague as to what is needed (“I should find the missing item first.” is the games favorite line… instead of giving some kind of hint what I’m actually trying to do there) and HOG item zones will activate with little rhyme or reason. For example there is a greenhouse which when you first visit does not have a HOG zone… but one activates later without giving you a single indication or reason to return to the greenhouse. Thus, you are forced to use hints or to go through every single room each time you are missing an item. As moving around in the game is very slow (the minimap can only take you to a few select locations) and the locations are very uninteresting to explore the game pretty much forces you to use hints a lot.The minigames and HOG sections themselves are uninspired. The items you search for are randomized and when you return to search the same area you often have to look for the same items again (even items that you previously took and used). Many objects are badly sized, coloured strangely, sometimes wrongly named and there is very low sensitivity to your clicks, e.g. you have to click very precisely and sometimes that is not enough. I once clicked 5 times on a chain and it simply refused to work making me believe it was the wrong item. It wasn’t.The time travelling gem that changes the scenes is nice… I guess. However, very little is done with it in the sections I played (I only found the first crystal before I finally decided this game was not worth playing). Only means you have to keep an eye on the crystal to see if you can change the time in a room. Anyway, I bought the game for about 1 Euro and still feel a bit cheated. Avoid."

And someone decided to hide every single piece of evidence and items, and lock each one up so that you not only have to find the clues and pieces you need, but you also have to find keys and items that open up the devices that those things are hidden in. You just fart around for 2-3 hours looking for 3 silly crystals. And when you find them, BAM, story is over, that is all. Definitely my least favorite hidden object game to date. If you can get it for under $1 and have some time to waste, go for it. Otherwise don't bother."

You spend more time running around the entire map to get the one part you need in order to unlock the next section, and less time scanning a scene for a list of objects.  There is no freedom of choice in selecting a scene.  You can only do a scene when the story calls for it.  Once you have done that scene, it goes away and you cannot access it again.I bought this for $3.74, and I recommend that you not do the same."

Sadly, ""Crystals of Time"" is not one of them.First of all, the game pretty much leaves you to your own devices for the most part. It's hard to tell which rooms you're supposed to go to next; I kept having to press the hint button to figure out where I was supposed to go. Not only that, you can't easy-jump from room to room using the map; it only leads to certain general areas of the house, the garden, etc. As a result, there's a lot of backtracking involved, and it quickly gets annoying.Second, the so-called story in this game really has no bearing when you actually start playing. First of all, why does a thief need to break into an abandoned mansion? And those ""crystals of time"" that are supposed to be super-important? Yeah, you spend most of the game looking for the crystals, but actual time traveling literally only happens in three rooms of the game. Nowhere else! This results in the ending being one of the most anticlimactic I have ever seen. We're introduced to all these characters and pieces of a story, but they don't seem to completely fit together.As for the puzzles themselves, they're fine. I was pretty much able to figure them all out without any difficulty. But if you like a good story to go with your hidden-object adventure games, I do not recommend this one. At least, not unless you like sitting for thirty seconds waiting for the hint button to recharge."

You'll see we all had the same impressions.This is one of those mixed point & click / HOGs. Actually you'll spend less time in HO scenes and more time navigating rooms and interacting with stuff to unlock stuff. Which would be okay, if the developers didn't mess it up.Usually it's normal to think ""hmm, what do I do now?"" in adventure games, because there's something we're not remembering. It's part of the fun. But in this game? You'll stay stuck until you click ""Hint"", and it's the game's fault. (more below)The goodArt is fine, as it is in most HOGs.Music is the best thing about the game, beautiful tracks you won't get tired of.Puzzles are okay. On the casual side. Nothing that will make you pause.Plenty of locations, and a map screen to quickly teleport (this is also a negative, more below.)Thank goodness for that Hint button. Use it liberally, and don't feel bad about it, because the game is designed in a dumb way. (more below)The badHO scenes will unlock without any sort of notification, in places where they weren't active before. There's dozens of locations, and at any time any of them can activate a new HO scene. You'll have NO IDEA unless you keep running around checking all the locations... or clicking ""Hint"". I can't tell you how annoying this is, to doubt yourself as a player. ""I can't tell what to do now... is it because I need to remember something? Or is it the game being STUPID again?""For a HO game, the HO scenes are not that many. And you'll be repeating them several times, and hunting the SAME objects. At least other games that make you repeat a HO scene make sure you're hunting a different set of objects each time.Let me repeat once again the general feeling of being lost and confused that accompanies you constantly in this game, and not in a good or fun way. If you manage to push through to the (very abrupt and poor) ending, I'm sure you will be out of any ♥♥♥♥s to give by the end, like I was.There's a map screen to help with all the tedious back and forth between all the locations - but the map only has a handful of places to teleport to, out of more than 20. So you'll still have to click click click through the slow transitions.Story is not really something you look for in HOGs, and it's not strong here either.This game left me♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. Mostly because it could have been good. Ah well. Plenty of good HOGs out there. This one sadly not among them.Thumbs down, I guess."

Some of the good ones are free, heck there are even decent HOGs on facebook. You have a variety of them to choose from, you shouldn't waste your time on Crystals of Time, it's not even free.No, you are obsessed withs HOGs? You just HAVE to get this one? You sure?Ok, so if you really want to spend your hard earned money (or your parents' hard earned money) on this particular game try to at least get it really cheap. Like in a bundle, during sales, with a coupon or something, just don't buy it full-price because in all honesty it's not worth it.There are a few reviews that eloquently explain why this is one HOG that's probably not worth your time, so I'll just list the things that annoyed me most.-No storyline that makes sense.-No voiceacting or animations.-A lot of back-and-forth fetch quests for no reason.-Really easy puzzles even on the ""hardest"" difficulty.-Some pixel hunting.-Poorly designed map that doesn't really save you any clicks.-Lack of common sense.-Most abrupt ending in the history of abrupt endings.The art was not bad, and the music wasn't irritating. After the first couple of hours you kinda get the weird logic of the game so it becomes less annoying and you can enjoy it a bit. I can't find anything else that I liked about this one.To make your life easier I have only one advice. Notice the spots where the HOS appear. At random times, when you need an item, you will have to go back there and play a new HOG in the same location. No, most of these do not have a logical connection so you'll have to go through most of them again and again seraching for the elusive HOG. So when you're stuck you either hit the hint button, or go throught every room and location and try to find out where the new HOG is.Good luck..?"

Most of the game is going back and forth through old scenes looking for a hidden object scene to pop up so that you can find the next item you need.The base storyline to the game lacks any depth and even after all that bore I was shocked at how quickly the game ended after I finished.

,Recommended,306410,12383170,"Posted: 5 October, 2014",all,JaysonFour,"To be quite honest, as long as you simply look at this as a linear hidden object game, you won't be disappointed.   It's extremely forgiving- to the point where there's no time limit, no penalty for errors or hint abuse, and no bad end.You play as the daughter of a very successful cat burglar, who has vanished on his latest caper- a house on the coastline of the northeastern United States, where a scientist and his helper have vanished.  Your job is to collect hidden objects and find key items in those puzzles to open the path in front of you, leading towards your father and discovering just what happened and whatever went wrong to get the mansion in this state.There's a fair amount of puzzle-solving, but the game will tell you outright if you're missing any pieces to the puzzle you're working on- so if you still need other pieces, you'll be able to find out right away instead of wrestling with it for three hours and realizing then that you were missing a piece.   There is plenty of backtracking, and none of the items ever change places.If you can grab it for five bucks, it's a good game for the younger crowd, but those looking for a deeper offering may want to give this one a pass."

Half the game is spent walking from place to place trying to find the hidden object spot that's reactivated; you'll replay most of them 3-4 times each, and it's always the same. No new items, old items are never removed. The game is obsessively linear; even if you have an AHA! moment and know you'll need something, you can't grab it. :( And when you need several items in a row, it doesn't activate all the rooms at once, only one at a time, so you can be led along like a good doggie and never veer off the path. The time mechanic would have been kind of cool, but it was woefully underused. I don't even need to go into the story, which is appropriately bad for this kind of game; the ending was a joke, though, basically ""congratulations!"" then dumping you back to the title screen. Graphics are mediocre; it usually wasn't hard to tell what something was, but everything looked cut-pasted with no consistent lighting, plus the usual mindlessly hiding long things on edges.The worst part was the misspellings and the wrong words, like calling a butternut squash a pumpkin, or a cutting board a ""trencher"", or a vaccuum tube an ""electric lamp"", which is actually an important story item. It adds up to some real confusion, and makes you wonder how much of the game was just phoned it with a visit to wikipedia.The music is actually pretty good, rather haunting. If it wasn't punctuated by long segments of no music at all, it'd be the highlight of the game.If you're desperate for a puzzle, give it a shot, but there are many better options."

The story is pretty basic and straight forward.Some people might find it an annoyance to have to wander around to get clues and objects.But really, all you need to do is access your map to get closer to the rooms you need to be in.This isn't an mmorpg, don't think that you'll be able to click on everything and expect to find secret spots.Crystals of Time has very simple game mechanics, you only click what's necessary.So if you're a fan of simple, no frills, games and want a relaxed playing experience?Then yes, you'll probably enjoy Crystals of Time.But if you want to be able to poke around more and get more in depth?This may not be the game for you.For what it is, I find it to be a well made game.The developers knew exactly what they wanted and stuck with it.Even technically, there was nothing inherently wrong with the gameplay.It just all boils down to personal preference."

The HOG scenes are fine, the story is fairly interesting... but there are some major problems. First, it is so insanely random that it drove me nuts. You have to constantly go back and forth between random and otherwise completed locations to play the HOG games. I hate using the hint button, but I eventually had to. The only other option was to literally click through 10-20 screens to figure out which one I needed. That aside, gameplay is very simple and the mini-games are easy. The artwork is nice and the music adds to the mood of mystery. So it's not all bad, but definitely something you want to buy on sale, if at all."

76561198063263421,Recommended,306410,11877988,"Posted: 26 August, 2014",all,Ted McAuley,"Crystals of Time is a fun little hidden object game for anyone looking to kill three-or-so hours without too much mental commitment. There are a handful of puzzles, the difficulty of which range from very easy to moderately difficult, yet the mere activity of going through and solving them is satisfying enough. While the game is pretty straight forward, with only the occasional possibility of getting stumped, you can use the time crystal Ashley Ford starts out with to give you a hint--these are visual cues that trigger the player's understanding of what to do next instantaneously. There were, perhaps, a few too many of the ""hidden object"" sessions, but these are trifling and take only a few minutes to complete, even when you're presented with two or three to complete in a row. A big hint I would have found useful: if you come to a place where you seem to have run out of things to do, return to the places where you have scavenged for hidden objects before; often you will have to do another round of object finding in order to come up with the next item needed to proceed in the game.One of the strongest elements to Crystals of Time is the artwork. As the entire experience plays out in a series of still pictures (with some minor animation at times), the player is treated with a wide array of stunning visuals that range from the vast, brooding insides of a sprawling mansion, to a glittering moonlit coast. It is an art style which is relatively simple, but detailed and colorful enough--with an excellent use of source-light shadings--that it never gets tedious to look at. In addition to the art, the soundtrack is both simple yet effective, adding to the atmosphere of the game in a substantial way. And, although there are only three-or-four songs to be had, the game designers were smart enough to allow for long stretches of silence between each play so that they don't get redundant.The story, on the other hand, isn't very remarkable. It's pretty shallow and without any real character depth or interaction. Still, in a simple hidden object game such as this, it's not really all that imperative. The surface-deep story matches the overall casual nature of the game, and it's not really a knock against it; this game is light fair, enjoyed best when entering into it with a hankering for a nice, noncommittal gaming experience. I did, however, run into one glitch which probably won't happen reliably with every play-through: the journal somehow got locked up halfway through the game, and with each proceeding entry, the text overlapped upon the previous entry, rendering the book virtually useless. Thankfully, the game is clear enough that it did little to hinder my progress.After all's said and done, Crystals of Time comes recommended at it's cheap $4.99 price-point, and is a no-brainer on sale for two dollars or less."

It has a story which can easily be skipped, even though clues can be found in the pieces we get throughout the game. The book helps keep track of the current mission but never shows where you should go. I had to use the hint-gem too often to not have to click around and not being able to find that one room where I am supposed to find one small item to be able to move forward.There were a lot of small puzzles, many which I truly enjoyed. Some felt original (no idea if they were) and some were classics like Memory. Sometimes I needed to combine items to create one item needed to move forward and it felt like it was just to drag out the gameplay. I stood at one end of the map and needed to go all the way back to the beginning. I managed to get through by stopping in every room before going back to where I was. This happened a lot towards the end.During the small minigames of searching for objects it was fairly easy to just click around the screen. This made the minigames too fast and smooth which eventually was all I wanted since I came back over and over to the same scenes to pick up the same objects. Some objects on the list stood out and did not melt into the background properly which made it too easy to find. Many of these searching games were only to find an item needed to put together a bigger item which could then be used to move forward in the story. It felt forced and I sighed a lot when I discovered I needed to do another one of those. Even though the game is basically all about the searching minigames I think it could have been fewer of those in the same area with the same objects.The hand-drawn backgrounds were gorgeous. I spent some time just looking at them when entering them for the first time. Really skilled work and it looked great on the screen. Impressed! The soundtrack was also relaxing and never felt repetitive.The story was not very interesting. It had potential but was not executed to its fullest.

This is one of the ones I would recommend skipping completely.It's nothing special and it's more annoying than it is pleasureable. The UI has minor annoyances that become greater as the game passes. There are no reasons given for why you have to back track to find other puzzles. Your intentions aren't clear pretty much ever. The time travel aspect is under-utilized and when it is it doesn't make any real sense as to why you it would really matter. These games usually only rely on the hint button when you are stuck on that last stupid thing to find in a puzzle or if you've lost track of things. Here it's the only way you don't waste 10 minutes each and every step backtracking through the entire map.Speaking of the map, the in-game map is almost not worth it. There are only a handful of points available to teleport to and I don't know what is lazier - The lack of nodes on the map or my need to teleport to♥♥♥♥♥ends of each area instead of clicking through. I vote the map coding is lazier.This is one of the worse games of this type I've played.

It's a hidden object-mystery-puzzle game, generally. I mean, it's able to hold your attention (if you're into this kind of game) but it's lacking a few things. First off, I played it straight through and I did slightly enjoy it. One issue I have with the game is that it is very short. And the ending is so lame. Lol, but that's to be expected with a short and simple game like this is. Now, another issue is that it doesn't tell you where you need to go next; no clue, no hint - nothing. You have to use your ""hint"" button to be able to figure out what you're supposed to do. That's fine and all - except when you need to use it cause you totally got stuck on something, got lost or whatever possibly could happen (IE: I lost my hint when I needed to find an item I was looking for FOREEEVER).Also, there are 2 modes you can play in - Normal and Hard.

I'm not saying that as someone who hates this genre either, I enjoy quite a few of these games, especially a few I picked up cheaply from Big Fish (which are what I will be comparing this game too.)First we can start of with some of the major issues with the game;There is next to no indication of areas you can travel to, I spent a good while of my gameplay being stuck all because I couldn't find the correct pixel on the screen to get to the right area.Going from that, items are very picky about  being placed in the right place. A good example being early in the game where you have to place a fuse in a fusebox below the mansion to light it up. However simply placing the fuse in the box isn't good enough, you have to specifically put it in the place where it would actually go. Logical? Yes. Fun? No.In true hidden item game fashion many random items are scattered around in completely random places. Although some of them are almost completely unseen without the use of a hint.Story? There was barely a single drop of story to be found in the entire game. I honestly didn't know what I was doing or why I was doing it for most of the game.Unlike many of the Big Fish games I have played there was no voice acting and no characters built up. For example when using a wrong object in the wrong puzzle would give you a small ""I don't think this will work,"" or a joke about how silly a combination may be, even if it were logical. This game has none of that, half the time I'm stuck retrying my combo to see if I simply missed the tiny area it wanted me to place an object in.The areas themselves don't look so bad, but they don't provide much atmosphere besides 'spooky (maybve haunted) mansion wooo'Overall this game really is below expectations, leaving much to be desired. Though if you can pick it up cheaply and really enjoy the genre you may find some enjoyment in it.Score- 3/10"

The seek and finds are tediously repetitive, the graphics are grainy and low resolution (adding to the tedious nature of the seek and finds) and the ending to the game is ultimately unsatisfying. There are also some language/translation issues, which can be problematic in the seek and finds. A few times an inaccurate term was used for an object (worm instead of caterpillar), and other times archaic and inaccurate terminology was used.The journal entries were nice, and the quick travel map was a good idea, but I wish it were possible to zap to more locations with it.If you regularly play these sorts of games, go ahead and pick this up, but you'll probably finish the game in an hour or two, so make sure you buy it at a price that makes the short length worthwhile.

The ending sucked so hard I started to laugh.Fast travel is SO bad, there are many many scenes and you get to fast travel to about seven of them. You pick the scene that's closest to where you want to go and then have to pass like four-five scenes to get there anyway. Kind of not what fast travel is.For many puzzles you only get ""I have to find the missing item(s) first"", without getting to know what is missing.Since the map is sucky-suck you don't get to know where to go next to find the item you need, and looking through 25 scenes just to get to the only HOP available is neither fun nor ideal. You'll end up using hints for everything you need to do, and it takes like a second to do it and looong for the hint button to reload even in normal mode.The HOPs, yes. You'll get to play through every one like what felt like 25 times, and every time you get back all the things you've taken are back, AND if you're lucky you get one or two new items to find. Seriously, HOPs where you have to find the same things in the same places over and over? I've never encountered that even once. It's not good.How this game is recommended by curators I don't understand. I regret even playing it.The only thing positive I have to say about this game is how the hints work. When pressing the hint button you get a little picture that shows the scene where you should go, instead of showing arrows leading to the place. I liked that.

It had a great atmosphere and the music is truly lovely - melancholic but modern.However, the game fast gets repetive, falling into the lazy traps that many hidden object games do.The good points:1. The music, as  I've said before is lovely. It fits nicely with the atmosphere and although it's not that varied it doesn't prove distracting, it adds to the experience.2. Many of the mini puzzles are interesting and provide a bit of a challenge and variety.3. The first 30 mins or so of gameplay are excellent, the diary gives you hints as to what you need to do and you don't mind skipping between locations to complete tasks/find objects.The bad points:1. In order to solve many 'puzzles' you need to collect objects to complete an item. Often these objects are hidden in completely non-sensical locations meaning that you have to trawl through all the possible locations of hidden object scenes. This could be so much better if you thought 'Ah, I need a pipe, I think I'll try the storeroom' rather than 'Ah, I need something to fix this damn boat and the diary is giving me no clue, I'll try every location until I happen to stumble across the correct hidden object scene - one of the master bedrooms'.2. In order to fix these 'puzzles' as I've said above, you have no real clue what you need to collect - there are no prompts - and so this undermines the puzzle element and just makes it a grind.3. The diary soon becomes of no use whatsoever. The 'clues' you pick up don't really help and there are no prompts.4.

There doesn't seem to be any way of knowing in which direction you should go the more rooms and areas you unlock leaving your path extremely confusing and frustrating. Also there is a lot of things... not that that's necessarily a bad thing but it's an over-abundant amount of items to collect and hold for later or go back for at another time which is the bad part due to the many areas you need to go. Finally, all that might be okay but the Hint bar refills so super slowly and gives vague hints as to where you should go next. Some games, the hint bar only empties when you're in the area you need to be in and it shows you what to focus on, but even clicking it and being in the wrong area empties it leaving me confused still. It was cheap but I still wouldn't have wasted the money I spent on it had I known how bad this is."

Put simply it doesn't give you clues as to what your supposed to do at a given time. If you do play it you will spend an extraordinary amount of time just looking for a puzzle to solve. I would have not spent as much time playing it if it werent for the hint button. I am generally pretty good at these games but this one lacks direction.I suppose you cant expect too much from a game that is on sale for less than 1$.

The artwork and soundtrack are amazing but the gameplay itself is a little off, but not enough to leave a negativ recommendation. The drawback is how exact you have to be when clicking on the objects, a hair off and it won't work. The text boxes are a little distracting and don't seem to fit the rest of the beauty in this game. I would rate it 7/10 I WILL play again."

The next day my computer wasdown and I could not  load windows it damaged my OS I doo believ.If this game is one tha t came from the Big Fish  Game site ,I'm not sure but that site is loaded with Malware I tired to download the game manager this morning and almost screwed up this computer I'm using now so I had to just let the games I bought on there  go and forget about  them. So beware,and this is only my opinion because I do believe it,beware of games from Big Fish. I am afraid to play this game."

It is too short, too simple, and quite unrealistic - although it does have a nice soundtrack, if a bit repetitive. Would be a fair game for younger children who are interested in basic puzzle games."
