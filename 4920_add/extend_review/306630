I am British so I don't have any real feeling of immersion playing the American Civil War but like any strategy game its the act of fighting a strategic war, with historical troops, and finding out about things you didnt know about that makes this game really interesting. The Civil War is an interesting period of history as well in that both sides had it tough, the war was a long brutal one, with much movement and innovation. So its an interesting conflict to play.The mechanics in this game are spot on. For example you dont move alone you move at the same time as the enemy does, so you have to predict where they are going to be and often you can get surprised. So thats very realistic. Far more realistic than attacking a paused enemy. Also you have very detailed heirarchy of troops including armies and corps, a lot like Paradox's Hearts of Iron 3 in fact. You get bonuses to things like supply and attack coordination for being well supported and organised which is good.You can use gunboats to support your attacks, You can syncronise your attacks, You can even have neighbouring friendly armies 'march to the sound of guns' and automatically move to support you in a battle.Pretty much everything you feel should be in the game is actually in the game, and this game is far more polished than the first game.The only downsides are that the game might not be all that stable - many crashes have been reported and I had a critical error crash in the first tutorial, five minutes into the game on my first turn's generation, but none in the actual game since. Also the GUI is rather bland looking compared to the lovely period one in the first game but its far easier to see whats going on and there are mods to add cosmetic improvements to it.Overall I would say this is probably the most complex strategic game I have ever played. The complexity does put you off playing it unless you have a bit of time and brain power to spare, but for those who love very deep strategy games this is about as deep as they get."

I ended up getting the game and was very very happy with it. It has a tremendous amount of depth, features and choice options on how to manage your side of the conflict. I really enjoy the strategic and regional level choices, while coordinating supply and unit command formations.I hate bugs and I hate crashes, when i read that in the reviews it was very dissapointing and I almost didn't purchase the game. If you are experience crashes, there are several suggestions in the forum as to fixes. For me personally I used the userpath.ini delete fix and thought that worked very well cutting down on crashes. Also something to note, you can get the game to auto save between 3-12 turns...so crashes or tech issues shouldn't stop anyone from playing as you can easily recover, and sometimes just reprocess the turn.Immersion, This game via its strategic and regional level options combimed with supply, unit production and army configurations is defintely a deep, rich and immersive experience. The map is huge, has many fiters and the wego system is by far the best system to be used on this kind of game. I want to really reiterate that, some games I don't think its great for and this is the first game I've truly been able to say, is better off for having the wego system as it provides the best gaming experience for this war/era.This is not for the light hearted gamer nor the total war style of gamer. This is actually more realistic because in a grand strategy sense you are not some godlike presence that can order every individual unit on the battlefield. You do choose who commands your bde, division, corps or armies, you do get to build up these types of units and combine them to make your composition of forces, and if you pay attention to the ground your fighting on, supply, unit cohesion and all the other factors the game takes into account, you will do well. However, if you take 20k men into a seige, tell them to assault the walls with no arty support, guess what, ur men are gonna get slaughtered.I personally spend 1-2 hours per turn, the game does 2 week time frames, early in the month for the first two weeks and late in the month. This works great because the game using the wego system processes each turn into 15 days. So coordination of forces matter a lot and in reality u have every single day of the war being played.I had never been a fan of the ageod battle system, I personally dont think its right for the american rev period, nor do i think its right the for world war one era, for the civil war and the napoleonic era though its really is the most realistic and superior system for those time periods. I encourage you if you are a grand strategy fan, to try it and give yourself a few days of playing to get used to it. I believe like myself you will see the benefit and the beauty of the system in this time period for this title.You will absoutely get your monies worth if you put in the time to learn the features and options. The Grand strategy genre is my absolutely favorite and those are the games I really excell at because of all the different things you have to manage. I know this isn't billed as grand strategy because you can only play two sides, but the amount of choice, different options and features in the game make it a grand strategy title to me. Indeed, I wish they came out with a game like this that allowed u to be any country in the world like a lot of the paradox titles allow you to do.All in all i highly recommend this game if you love history, the civil war, and grand strategy games."

It is for people who enjoy taking the time to plan their actions, to include both short and long term goals. Playing as the CSA in the gam'es largest campaign is quite difficult and you will develop an appreciation for the strategic and logistical problems the South faced during the War of Northern Aggression. The AI is quite good at exploiting your weaknesses and, playing as the CSA, I have often fallen afoul of Federal raids into the relatively undefended regions of Louisiana and it's important industrial center of New Orleans. The AI has also done a good job of reacting to my offenses and will quickly trade a weakened force for a stronger one. I highly recommend this game."

It is grand strategic with minimal tactical play.  The gameplay does a good job of demonstrating the importance of leadership, supply, industry, and recruitment.  The AI is a decent opponent if you give it adequate bonuses such as activation and detection.So why the negative review?  Performance and Interface.  For one, irratating errors (in french) resulting in either crashing the game or CTDs.  Secordly, the game speed while not lethargic, feels jerky and the response time often lags between key press and execution.  Locating leaders is frustrating.   It is cumbersome to have to search the game log (not complicated but easy to overlook), for reinforcements and new leaders instead of a simple prompt that appears at the beginning of each turn.   The game is not very user friendly and takes some getting used.While I personally like the game, I can not recommend the game to new users unless you are a diehard wargamer."

Most fall short but maybe this game succeeds too much. Its got everything, including a very long manual you will need to read and understand if you want to learn how to set up armies and how to train them, feed them, and lead them to victory. If you don't understand the logistics, it's going to be a frustrating, losing endeavor. You won't find a lot of help on the internet either.

Im glad i did, CW2 hooked me and then some. If you are looking for a Total War type experience with tactical battles, then this game is not for you. If you like classic Grand Strategy wargames, then this should be right up your alley. To me, the test of a good strategy game is one that has you wanting to finish that one more turn before going to bed and one that keeps you thinking about the game after you left the computer. This game will do that.Be forewarned...you must spend the time reading the manual, doing the tutorials and watching some ""lets play"" vids on youtube to learn how to play this game...the interface is a bit clunky at first, but not bad once you get used to it. The game unit cards and map are well done. This game reeks of civil war flavor...I have had only 2 CTD crashes in the many hours that I have played...both of these were at the start of new turn processing and were easily recoverable without any issues in proceeding with the next turn.Lots of strategic choices that allow for special actions, unit building, etc..CW2 rates a thumbs up in my book!"

The journey in learning all of it is really the best part. Sitting there and analyzing the unit pictures, stats, and reading events that happened during the time period accompanied by music from the period is what makes this game fun. If you ever learned about the American Civil War but text-books with fancy pictures and paragraphs-on-paragraphs of text didn't strike your fancy, maybe a game designed to both teach you and actively have fun in such affair, will.Civil War II will allow you to play the Union or Confederate side, which ever side strikes your fancy. Futhermore, you'll be able to mobilize these two faction's infrastructure both economically and militarily to achieve either the historic or alternate-historic victory of either side. The goal of the game is to defeat the enemies' army and naval units and capture vital objectures (towns, cities, regions, etc.) until you meet the victory conditions specified by the scenario.Most scenarios have ""sudden death"", which means if you capture all the objectures early and manage to lower the enemies' national level to a certain level, you can win the scenario before the turn limit is up. But don't let turn limits scare you away, the term limits on the grand campaign and medium sized scenarios are momentous, some ranging a whooping 80+ turns to 15+ if they are battle scenarios. In Civil War II, if you don't want to go through all motions of organizing the army and navy during the grand campaign, there are battle scenarios available as well. These scenarios usually begin with the army and navy already properly organized, and all the player has to do is manage the strategic manuvering of the army well, setting important combat stances and rules of engagement to achieve victory against the enemy. The AI in this game is swift, and strikes with an iron fist. The AI in Civil War II will not show you mercy, therefore, for new comers to such a wargame should note that the losing battles and getting your butt kicked by the AI is completely normal in the learning process of Civil War II.To sum up this review, Civil War II is a fantastic game, and is also one of Ageod's newer titles with a streamlined interface and as always, a great job in re-enacting the subject conflict with historical accuracy and attention to detail such as an accurate representation of combat, moral, etc. Both food and ammunition is accounted for, and contruct armies through corps, divisions, regiments, and brigade units, all the while building factories and armories across the nation the fuel the war engine to achieve victory. There are plenty of historical events and decisions to read and choose from, and there is a lot of content to wrap your head around to immerse yourself in the game and conflict."

Only they would have the time to play such a complex game.  Not that I don't like complex.  I love Dwarf Fortress and Hearts of Iron III.  But in this game they somehow mixed complex with abstract information.  For example, a battle result screen covers the whole computer screen but I can't find where it says who won.  And also, it measures a unit's strength by giving it a 'power' number.  Hmm..how about just telling me how many soldiers or horsemen or artillerty it has?  It makes judging how much force you have in a certain stack kind of hard.  Is 230 a good number?  What about 890?  And this, of course, is not a solid number - as weather, terrian, and other factors can change it during the battle.Once again, let me point out, that I have played and enjoyed complex games.  Norm Koger's The Operational Art of War, with the 160 page manual, for example is a great game.But this game....Organizing your units has been made more complex than it every needs to be.  Units who are part of a chain of command do better than those out on their own - which makes sense.  But forming Armies and moving them can take much of your time.Sadly, for such a complex game, the political and economic parts of game are nothing but you triggering certain events that cost money and victory points and so on.There is also supplies, training, transporting, and so-on, so-forth.The UI is the most complex I have ever seen and the tutorials are good for what they explain.  But I would say they cover about 50% of the game's interface and do not even touch on the naval forces or blockades.  Even the manual points out that tooltips are needed because many functions are not covered in the manual.  Let me repeat that.  The manual states that many functions are not covered in the manual.You will not even be able to get a refund as the tutorials will take you more then two hours.I strongly suggest this game only for gamers who a lot of time, who love the American Civil War, and are willing to spend a few days learning how the game works.  Other wise....skip it."

That said, Civil War 2 is a pretty good game; though I must say it bugs out on me often and crashes fairly regularly. I felt it was immersive enough to put up w/ it. Logistically and strategically, the game feels very real. Travelling over long distances, through rough terrain with little to no respite will have your men (especially the less experienced and least trained) fighting like trash in their next engagement. Battles can be a little confusing, especially at first, but if you READ the MANUAL, you'll often see how you lost a battle or why your superior forces keep running away like a bunch of cowards. Toying around with the options there's a decent amount of settings to fine tune it to your standards of ""realistic"". Basically, theres a lot to it, a lot of numbers and math going on behind the scenes. For example, you set your general's stance (aggressive passive ect) his ability to actually engage an enemy force even in the same tile however is based on a number of other factors as well (perception, fatigue, terrain type, morale, forces at his disposal) and thats even if he's capable of changing stances to begin with. Turns are taken simultaneously, your decisions that you make beforehand playing out at the same time as your opponents'; Battles are an automated affair and the whole thing plays out on a campaign map like many of the genre. You could say half the game is playing out in your mind. Personally, you can't get a more realistic simulator on a specific conflict than an AGEOD game."

While the game developers did take some historical liberties creating game, they did accurately demonstrate the complexities, nuances, and difficulties of single-handedly commanding an entire war - let alone the American Civil War - which I have yet to see repeated. So, if you're a die-hard Civil War or turn-based strategy games, you might want to check this game out.On the other hand, the game can be buggy, the AI intelligence can be slow at times, and you essentially need a massive adderall prescription to comprehend the manual in a single reading. Furthermore, the game is offers a strictly *top-down"" all supreme commander's perspective of the war. Probably for various reasons, the game developers decided to omit tactical enagements (much to my, and others, chagrin). Also, the game's price tag is pretty steep; the only reason why I purchased the game is because I think there are a dearth of great Civil War video games for me to nerd out on in lieu of my social life. Yet, price is a matter of perspective I suppose.Finally, I know my review is rather cursory: I didn't delve too deeply into the mechanics of the game, its graphics, its GUI, and so on. I suspect anyone with a deep interest in the Civil War will probably overlook their qualms with these elements of the game just to enjoy burning Atlanta to the freaking ground (I sure did, anyway). I'm sure there are other reviews which offer a more detailed account about the game and its mechanical flaws anyway.

The map of the game represents the United States and North Mexico. Boxes also represent the Caribbean, France and England, to simulate a possible engagement of these countries in the conflict, but also to allow a blockade of the ships having traded with Europe. The map is divided into zones, each state of the United States being composed of several zones. A game turn represents 15 days. And as soon as two or more armies are in the same area, a confrontation is possible but not mandatory, some units have the ability to dodge an attack.At the level of the units present, in addition to the commanders there are infantry, cavalry, artillery, refueling trolleys, but also naval units, be it river patrollers , troop-carrying vessels, or more traditional vessels intended for navigation on the high seas. Each unit has characteristics relating to its ability to move, its degree of detection, its morals, its supply of food and ammunition, as well as some special abilities like the possibility of ambushing, moving faster on certain types of terrain, ect.At each turn of the game, the player organizes the movement of his troops, but also the creation of new units, depending on the available reserves, replacing the losses suffered by the units that fought, but also reorganizes his troops, avoid penalties due to the absence of a commander or the fact that a commander has too many troops under his command. Units are also assigned an attitude (defensive, offensive, passive) and rules of engagement, which will define the behavior of a unit when it encounters an adverse unit.Besides purely military management, you also have more specific options, related to the management of the  nation. Thus, financial options allow, among other things, to issue currency or to levy new taxes. The economic options allow to stimulate the development of the economy in certain regions, or to develop a specific type of industry. Means of transport may also be the subject of this type of option: increasing the number of steamboats to promote river transport, or extending the railway network. Of course, these options have a cost, both in hard cash and in terms of national morale. The national morale is a representation of the morale of the population of the camp played. This morale is evolving, as a result of a battle, a choice of an option, a random event, etc.). When this morale increases to a defined value from the start of the chosen scenario, victory is automatic. And if it falls below a certain value, it is defeat that is automatic.THE GOOD- Some mechanisms that fine-tune management and allow influence on the course of a battle- Order of battle, with the infantry units designated according to their state of origin- Graphics looks good- Soundtrack pleasant enough to listen toTHE BAD- The feeling of not having much to do, or not knowing what to do- Lacks the possibility for the player to intervene in the middle of a battle8/10DISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD |GREAT| AMAZING | MASTERPIECE"

It probably takes you about 2 or 3 hours to go through all the tutorials when reading the whole thing, but it was worth it.When I started my first solo campaign, I started experimenting, moving the pieces. I have to be honest, sometimes I felt lost. It takes some time to get used to the user interphase. When I started to get more familiar with the game, thats when the sense of achievement started invading me. Enacting the economic, military and diplomatic decisions, recruiting a great variety of units, choosing the right generals for the right army, corps or division... OMG, loved it!Right now after 50 something hours in the game, I'm still enjoying playing the Union. I think I'm still going through the learning curve, since I believe there are still some tricks I'm missing in order to dare starting a full scenario siding with the CSA (that is a challenge).Usually I don't like writing reviews, but this game is a true gem, and as such, I think it is my duty to spread out the good word."

Civil War 2 isn't perfect, but if you're a patient wargamer, with a love of history, then this game is for you. The strategic view, as with all AGEOD games, is about as solid as you can get while still remaining easy to use. Tactically, this game is wanting. I love the addition of the ""battle strategy"" feature, but it never felt like picking a strategy in that feature really turned the tide in battle. If AGEOD adjusts that a bit, it'd be great!I'd recommend this game for serious and semi-serious wargame enthusiasts.  If you're looking for simple, this isn't it."

You can see by the hours I have put in that I like this game. It was my first AGEOD experience and at first I admit I was rather confused at what to do.  But after reading the AGEOD forums I found that not only is this game amazing and the best American Civil War game available, but that the developers are very interactive with their gamers and have numerous other games for different time periods while they contantly improve on their methods.You have to like the game board turn based style.  If that is not your thing, maybe its not right for you, but you never know until you try. I am now a huge AGEOD fan and it all started with this game which I bought on a whim and despite other negative reviews from people who probably prefer to play Assasin's Creed or a similar game.My opinion? 100% recomended. Right now it is by far my favorite game. Once you figure it out you can literally forget to eat all day, it is that good."

I seem to be catching on pretty quickly.This game isn't about graphics... they are pretty simple. This is about the strategy of the CIvil War.I usually turn the music down, but I couldn't find a way to turn it off.... only a control on how often the music plays. I found myself turning that up so that it plays the music more often, because it fits so perfectly to the theme.My only complaint so far...

I would recommend it, even with its occasional tendenacy to CTD (which seems to be the biggest complaint about the game). I have found, though, if you save every couple turns, which is super quick to do, it seems to forgo the CTD. However, even if it does still crash by-chance, if you save at the beginning of each turn, it takes no time to load the saved game back up.Game is very deep and has a high learning curve, which I personally enjoy. Playing or watching (via Youtube) the tutorials is a must. Graphics are nice as well. Alot to do in the game each turn, if you so desire, that can be time-consuming (in a good way). The game has many historical events, and is loaded with different options to choose from each turn to develop your economy, improve your infrastructure or counter the enemy.Many different choices can be made, for example, that affects European intervention. It's a juggling act trying to balance everything just right each turn so that you have the resources you need to furnish and maintain your standing army, while also building it up, and investing in your economy so that it still grows and keeps you stronger than the South.The problem early on is the ineptitude of your unwieldy Army, if you play the North, so it is almost impossible to win a quick victory; thus, forcing you to try to hold the South at bay while you invest in your industry and foreign diplomacy until you have the leaders, and army, necessary to crush the rebellious scourge and unify that great Union once again.I have played a little over 17 hours and I've only made it to July 1862- I like it! Currently, I'm sitting outside the flanks of Richmond with a decent size army, but, Lee has build a formidable army that is safely hunkered down in the stalwart defences of this now fortified city with reinforcements on the way. He has better generals, and a dedicated, zealous army that lives in defense, but I have time, size and the cause of righteousness on my side!Rating: 7.5/10."

Keep in mind the combat is not tactical  its more like reading a after action report from your Army commanders. Fog of war is a must.

It's fun in the learning stages but can get frustrating at some points.There are two cons I have with this game- 1. The UI could use some tweaking.  2. The game has much needed work on the stability issues (It usually crashes between 7-11 turns).Where this game really shines is how you can change history, but in a much detailed level. From industralizing the South to making decisions to convincing the border states to join the CSA, it has it all.The games engine allows you to organize your army as you see fit. When you do, many minor or major factors apply which can be game changers for the next battle. So make sure you use the system of organization wisely (brigades, divisions, corps, and armies)"

Civil War Generals II had been my favorite US Civil War strategy game. I like turn based games where what you do affects what happens next, where as Ultimate General being real time with fixed results no matter what you do is far from interesting or compelling.The AI in CWII is tough to get right for your type of play. Following the ideas on Ageod's forums or the numerous Youtube vids will give you a starting point for AI tweeks.The AI will exploit your weaknesses and do some outright stupid things from time to time, as will you. There isn't much you can recover from and move on. Of course if you have a friend you can play PBEM (play by email). You and your opponent will still to dumbs things but then you can't blame the AI.I do not feel the cost of this game is out of line. I have paid way more in the past for old SSI games which I still love. Fifty Mission Crush is still one of my favorite games.A demo from AGEOD would be nice for folks who are unfamilier with turn based games as huge as this one. Supply, troup replacements and creation along with the political pressure can be a bit much for some.  I have not figured out if the politcal sidebars actually have any affect on the game. If you know let me know.  You seem to have much more affect on the countries moral than any of the reports or historical news articles.That is my 2 cents. Not an easy game to understand or play.

This entire post is going to list my complaints in no general order. I've spent two days trying to learn and get into this game and at the end of the day I've come up completely empty. From the start it feels like the game is out of your control. The game is completely in the hands of the AI and there's nothing you can do about it. Your troops are too numerous and you can't get your main forces in Virginia under the command limit, you're assaulted by a lot of values and a lot of information that don't make a lot of sense, and every time you hit that 'next turn' button you're hit with losses upon losses as you watch your territory dissolve away without you having any choice in the matter.The interface is so clunky. I shouldn't have to undergo so much trouble to find my own units. I'll constantly be trying to click on elements of units and just be wasting time because I'll click back to the terrain mode and unselect my units. That's so annoying. It's almost as if the Devs don't play their own game.So you lose a battle. Your first question is why? There's plenty of values that this game throws at you, but there's no way of telling exactly why you lost a battle. Were you in the wrong stance? Did terrain not work to your advantage? Did you cross a river? Were these forces working for or against you and if not, how much? The game doesn't tell you any of this. You're just hit with the after-action reports, a defeat of your own forces, and you are left to try to figure out the answers for yourselves.The lack of any immersion is apparent from the beginning of the game. You click: ""Next turn"" and you are immediately spammed with messages about troops arriving and leaving in provinces. This is where the game becomes amazingly apparent at it's failure: No one likes to be bombarded by spam! The game hits you with spam every single time a unit enters or leaves a province and by the time you're at the end of those 15 days, you have no idea who has gone where or what they are doing and you are forced to examine the entire map to find out how exactly the AI has kicked your ♥♥♥ today. It would be far more better if the map zoomed out and you could see your units moving together with the opposing enemies in your field of vision as the days passed. That would be interactive and so cool! But instead? You get spam for 5 minutes. So upsetting.I think the worst thing of this so-called ""Go at the same time"" system is incredibly misleading. It should read: ""Get perfectly countered by the AI, all the time."" No matter what you do, the AI will know what you are doing and after you have made your move, they will counter and destroy you. It's only a matter of time. I've done the Gettysburg start as the Confederacy and tried several opening moves the one thing I've noticed is that the AI will make the correct move every single time. If you split your troops, they will attack your armies with just the right size troop numbers in multiple areas and destroy them. If you mass your troops and allow the enemy to come to you, they will always do the same and either instantly defeat your army or outgrow you with superior troop recruitment before crushing. If you try to recruit troops yourself, the AI will magically know and make a beeline for that province to try to stop it. And if you try to stop it, don't worry. The AI will just magically win that battle and not tell you why, so why worry about it?And you have these foreign trade routes and honestly, even with two days trying to figure out this game I have no idea how they work. Do they give me some sort of benefit and if so, how much? They instantly get blockaded within the first 30 days of the war anyway and there's no clear starting navy on the map for me anyway, so I end up losing that part of the war without any means to resist it. And I don't even know if I should resist it. Do they give me foreign support? Huh? How about money? Do they give me anything? Hello? The game doesn't tell you these details. They just...expect you to know what to do.I've been really depressed these last few days and I bought this game to try to enjoy myself in some good ol civil war fun. But it's overwhelmingly complicated and the AI seems rigged against you anyway, so all it's done has made me more depressed. You might as well not do anything and just keep hitting the ""Next 15 days"" button. You'll get the same result if you tried to play the game.You lose.Always."

I love their attention to detail, and the depth and the sheer possibility of intrigue and drama. That all said.. this game is criminally flawed.1. This game has NO MULTIPLAYER. The description details it as a multiplayer game.. any experienced gamer would expect to to be a multiplayer game.. but no.. they call it multiplayer because you can PBEM thats.. play by email. MULTIPLAYER!2. This game eats itself in only a matter of turns.. and anytime I have anything interesting about to happen I get a flurry of fail messages in french. Some can be skipped by and you get to go back to a dying game that you know can go no farther. In this state its often unable to create a new save game. So it reverts on the next resume. I have never been able to finish a game because of this.3. The South feels over-powered.. or the North feels under-powered.So there is the review.. if you love Civil War era games.. you may still want to buy this game. I am sticking it out hoping to change this review in the near future as I love the game.. and want to see them succeed.  That said.. its critically flawed.. and it basically lies about it's capabilities. This is a single player game of great depth and potential.. that cannot advance more than four turns without exploding into a ball of fire."

It appears you need a real Navy, to blockade if i am reading the in game suggestion.By September 1861 north has 4:1 in Northern Virginia and still you are waiting for southern troops to activate to move, while hords of unit troops move south with no leaders.brokenjunk"

Where Total War Naploeon talks with you on how the game is played and what to do, this one just gives you page after page of written instructions. Not just a few words to read, but full page after page  of written instructuions. These instructions are not written that well, and can be very confusing. They tried to do too much here, and the result of this is a game that is far too complex. This whole game needs to go back to the drawing board. They divided the instructions into 3 confusing titles. If you have poor reading skills you will NEVER figure this one out, and I have excellent reading skills, and this thig confused me. I hate to see what it will do to someone who has poor reading skills. DON'T BUY THIS, IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY AND TIME."

The new engine they created is ugly, conusing even for veteran players, and on top of everything it adds little to nothing from the original Civil War's engine and gameplay. I highly recommend purchasing the original Civil War as it's engine is more appealing to the eye and much more easy to get into."

It's challenging and forces you to think about how to do things.On the other hand, there's no multiplayer. Well, there is play by e-mail but this isn't the nineties.

Very confusing, buggy, otherwise poorly designed game and expensive to boot.

Before you go judging, please look at my library. I'm a big fan of the EU, Victoria, and Crusader Kings series, and I don't believe a game of this type should be all that difficult for me to pick up.What little time I've spent with this game is filled with:1. Trying to understand all the various menus2. Figuring out how to enact conscription3. Figuring out how to entrench a unit4. Figuring out how to replace a general5. Wondering why those limey Brits over in the Total War franchise can't just make an American Civil War game that everyone knows would be awesome.Maybe it's my fault because I sort of breezed over the tutorials. I'll admit that. But if I know how to play ALL THE OTHER GAMES in this genre, and have for a decade, then how much should I really have to relearn? Do I need to take college courses?For potential to the hardcore (and I do mean hardest of hardcore) strategy gamers, I will give this game a 6/10."

76561198084742637,Recommended,306630,20268484,"Posted: 3 January, 2016",all,Casandi,"Civil War II has the makings of bing one of the best strategy game available -- especially on the Civil War, definitely an underserved topic.  It's extremely complex, but that translates into a realistic feeling:  war is complex.Unfortunately, AGEOD has dropped the ball in 2 major areas:First, the bugs.  Almost all players have commented on them, so it's the game, not individual computers.  In a campaign, the game crashes about every 3rd turn.  Fortunately, reloading the game with a previous save allows the war to go on.  Except I reached March 1863 and encountered a hard crash that's unrecoverable, recurs after reboots & reloads.That's hundreds of hours down the tubes.  (I'm running an i7-3770 w/ 64 GB RAM & 4GB VRAM, Windows 10).  The game's been out almost a year -- 6 months since the last patch.  Obviously AGEOD has taken what money suckers gave them and gone on to other projects.The 2nd problem is balance.  In my games, whenever the USS Monitor meets the CSS Virginia, the Confederate ironclad is obliterated in a single battle, leaving the Monitor unscratched -- and able to navigate the Atlantic in winter to reach the Florida keys without refueling.It's impossible for the South to capture Washington.  There are over 1000 points locked into the city, ready to be released any time a Southern unit steps foot in Montgomery County (even if the unit is retreating from a minor skirmish in Frederick MD).  Not only that, a union army of about 500 points suddenly appears in Fairfax VA out of nowhere.Don't capture and then exit a union town.  A unit suddenly appears out of nowhere and retakes the town.  Though only 17-points strong, it can withstand seige by a 200-point division for more than 5 turns.Sigh.  CW II would be such an interesting game, if only AGEOD could invest just a little more time to fix the remaining problems.JULY UPDATEGood news!  The December 2016 update has resolved the crashing problems -- at least, so far.  Hurrah!Play balance...?  What were those Southerners thinking?  How could they think they could take on the North?  -- Given the North's vast super-overwhelming edge in troop numbers, industrial output, and technology?  (It's like the Union has more troops in Washington/Alexandria alone than the entire Rebel army!)  Is that authentic?  I donno.  Ask Robert E Lee....The South's ""saving grace"" is that usually a huge avalanche of Union troops runs up to the defender's front line...  (Or more like, oozes slowly in the general direction, maybe, sometimes.)  And they just sit there.  And sit there some more.  Nothing happens.  Sitzkrieg.  For turn after turn.Hint:  Supply is the thing.  Everything depends on having good supply trails.  Spend the 1st year making depots to the site of future campaigns.Hint 2:  The only Southern strategy is to create an impregnable defensive line.  Don't think you can launch any offensive operation anywhere at any time.  (Although be ready to make a limited thrust to take advantage of Northern errors.)"
