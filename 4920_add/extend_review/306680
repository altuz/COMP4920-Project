,Recommended,306680,13356673,"Posted: 13 December, 2014",all,Protoss,"What is Lexica?Lexica is a puzzle game where you have a set number of letters that each slide in one direction from a side of a crossword puzzle like box into the fields designated for them. So the letters to the left and right will only fit into the rank they are at, while the letters to the top and bottom will only fit into the file they are at.The difficulty in the game stems entirely from trying to find out what words you need to create. Since the game has three difficulties and is entirely in English, a good knowledge of English language is recommended to play this, otherwise you will spend a lot of time trying to figure out words since usually there would be several ways to fit all letters into all places, but only one where all designated ranks and files will contain English words.There is a total of 96 puzzles, divided into eight ""puzzle packs"", per difficulty - easy, intermediate and hard -, making a total of 288 puzzles in 36 packs. Since the only requirement for achievements is to complete all puzzles, 100p are definitely possible for everyone, although they will go a lot faster if he knows English language well and has a bit of geometrical thinking.The sound is nothing special, I usually have it off and music playing instead. The graphics are good enough, as you can see on the official screenshots. Overall the gameplay is the only selling point of this. For me, at a good but not perfect English level, the harder levels seem crazy at first view, but the easy ones are fine.The one thing that I really dislike is that only certain letters are used for achievements. Here I would have liked to have 26 achievements with one letter for each one, like in Lyne where you eventually can use them to spell out words on your Steam profile (achievement showcase).Recommended:For linguistic puzzle fans(Note that at the time of writing this review, on 14 December 2014, the game is 90p off, at this price you definitely should get it!)"

Recommend to anyone who wants to work on their vocabulary, critical thinking, and reading skills.  Basically you arrange the letters so they all form words. There is a timer that counts the amount of time it takes you so you can compare to others online if you wish but I just ignored this.  There were a few words I did not know but the puzzles could all be completed through process of elimination even if I did not know the words.  I looked them up later and it was nice to expand my vocab a little.  It is more of a game for adults as younger children will most likely find it difficult unless worked together as a family.   For those interested in getting 100% of the achievements it is only required that you complete every puzzle the timer does not factor into this.  Buy and enjoy word nerds!"

,Recommended,306680,11086898,"Posted: 5 July, 2014",all,unevermind,"..Revised Review..It will take you some time to get into the game but when you do it's a lot of fun and solving puzzles becomes very satisfying.The point of the game is to slide letters into slots that are arranged like in a crossword puzzle. There are letters placed all around the four edges. They can be slid along a vertical or horizontal axis. In order to find the right position of them all you'll have to work with probabilities (common English word endings e.g.) and methods of elimination, like you would in a game of sudoku.I was quite frustrated at first but now that I got the hang of it it serves as a nice destraction every now and then. As a lot of the words repeat it gets easier to guess them over time. Also, sliding all the stones onto the board and shuffling them around until you recognize one or two words works well when you are stuck.For a price as low as this, you can't go wrong if you're a fan of word puzzles."

You cannot play full screen, and using a mouse is incredibly frustrating, as the game was clearly designed for a touch screen on a mobile phone.Even compared to mobile word games, Lexica feels super bland. There's nothing witty or ingenious about the game, no mechanic that makes it special. You simply slide letters to try to make words. Puzzles don't even have a word theme, which should be a *minimum*!This game is simply a dull grind fest that plays bad on PC."

Although I can't attribute any originality to the authors the format has been well executed here.My only complaint is the rating system; based on average times, which means a couple of bad games can throw your rating and it can be quite hard to recover. I suppose though after playing many rounds this won't be such an issue.Also, I would like to know all of the possible ratings in order and their requirements, I'm aware only of competent and skilled.EDIT: now that I think of it I would like to see the board at the end of a completed session.

It's nota  crossword puzzle, because you don't know the words, nor are there any clues.  But it's a perfectly mixed bag of crossword/word search mixed with Sudoku.  The game gets increasingly hard as you go through the 288 levels.  The majority of the words are words that you should know while others you might just get lucky by using the Sudoku strategy of what letters can go where.  This was a very addictive puzzle game that I have to recommend to all of my friends.  Definitely worth the price if you love puzzle games."

This is the first game I've ever encountered that had literally zero replayability...since the game won't let you replay puzzles (to get a better score, for example).  This game needs a way to put in user-generated puzzles in the worst way.  Also...no quit function?  I guess it's a port from mobile OSes.  Not a big deal, you just close the window with the OS close button...just seems inelegant.  Also, no fullscreen mode, but then again this game really doesn't need that either.The descriptive text says it's a combination of Sudoku and Scrabble; I guess, but the only thing that's like Sudoku is the fact that you've got a grid.  That's not a bad thing, it's just worth mentioning that there is nothing about this game that has to do with Sudoku's pattern recognition or arrangement logic; it's all just vocabulary.On the plus side, when the real question comes up: Does this game justify its asking price ($5)?  Absolutely.  Obviously it's a mobile port, but that's perfectly fine for a game like this.  When I was a little over halfway through the Easy puzzle sets I felt like it was difficult, but not super hard.  You really do have to bring your vocabulary A game though.  I'm quite a literate English speaker (not bragging, it's relevant to this particular review) and even I was a little worried about Medium and Hard back then.  :)Now that I've completed the rest of the game, I can confirm that it does get quite a bit harder.  Given a strong enough English vocabulary, it is possible to complete the game without breaking out a Scrabble dictionary, but only barely.  There were a few words even I didn't know (again, not bragging...just giving context), which I only ever ""got"" because I filled in enough perpendicular words to either make the word or form an educated guess based on conjugation norms.So yes, at the end of the day I'd recommend this game; it's not the most robust word puzzle game you'll find, but if you like the gameplay (and the storefront images/video will tell you everything you need to know) then for the price you should definitely get your money's worth.On a contrary note, I'd have to recommend that non-English speakers avoid this game unless/until they add user-generated content support (all the puzzle words are in English).If you like this game, check out...Bookworm Adventures DeluxeBookworm DeluxePuzzler WorldPuzzler World 2ScrabbleWords For EvilWords With FriendsReview metadataDate of updateTime playedHow far in base game (estimate)?CostCost per hourNotes2014-10-07 00:0016.4 hoursHalfway through the easy puzzles$4.99 USD$0.30 USDInitial review2015-03-15 02:2232.1 hours100% complete$4.99 USD$0.16 USDAdded more sage wisdom from having completed the game, as well as bullet point and recommendation sections"

,Recommended,306680,35376969,Posted: 1 October,all,supernaut,"Lexica was fun for me up until Medium Pack 5, where my understanding of the English language slowed me down, though it is not my native language. I tried to fend off guides for as long as possible, checking a solution for a single word here and there, but also checking words in an online dictionary, up until I couldn't progress without a guide and without feeling frustrated. It became a chore due to my own limitations, not by a fault of the game, cos it's the same game from the first to the last puzzle, 288 in total. How hard the Hard Pack puzzles were I can't say, cos I was rushing to the end with guides at that point, just to be done with it.I would've liked to see a more educational aspect to Lexica. For example, all the words in an alphabetical order at the end of the game or at the end of each puzzle, where I can go over the words that I didn't know, even if the definitions aren't provided by the game itself. As soon as you drop the last letter in its rightful place, the puzzle is locked and at that point you can't revisit a solved puzzle, it only gives you the completion time. At the very least I think they should've included a feature to revisit solved puzzles. There are Steam guides and video guides on Youtube (up to Medium Pack 7), but the point of any game is for you to play it, not continue it outside of the game. Hard to say if it's worth 5 euros, but it's good fun for the most part and it looks nice. It's also nice to have it in windowed mode, so you can place it right next to Youtube videos, while you watch 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown, if that's your thing."

Get it for a couple of bucks or less and if you enjoy word puzzles you'll probably find yourself getting your money's worth.Easy puzzles are a minute or so.  Medium/Hard will average 3-4 minutes depending on your English vocabulary.There's a lot of feedback from others about the replayability - they're word puzzles, so solving them again wouldn't be fun anyway.  If I bought a crossword book I'd fill it in - I certainly wouldn't erase it and try to get a better time.  So as far as I'm concerned, replayability is a non-factor.   Simply recognize you're paying a couple of bucks for about 15 hours of reasonable fun.There are a LOT of science terms used in the puzzles.  Many are quite obscure.  And there are some alternate spellings of selected words (miaow comes to mind).  I didn't mind the science stuff as you can figure them out.  I didn't like miaow and ""SL"" amongst a few others as words. The few puzzles that had these felt more like trial & error than word puzzles.

The game provides a 6x6 board lined with letter tiles that can slide along their associated row or column in order to form words.  It's a very simple concept which can be surprisingly complex especially in the harder puzzles.  I found it quite challenging and enjoyable and it took me about 20 hours to complete all 288 of the game's puzzles.The game is obviously designed as a mobile game with a tall cell phone-sized screen but it works well on PC.  It takes full advantage of the mouse and you can even double-click on tiles to automatically move them if there is only one space available they can fit in.  I wish the game had some music though.A warning however since this game is in English and the harder puzzles especially use some very obscure words, non-native speakers may have extra difficulty completing the puzzles.  There has also been some concern about whether the game is made in US or UK English, but I did not encounter any words in which there would be spelling differences.As a final note, the game does not allow you to replay puzzles so you have to delete the same file in order to do so.I would definitely recommend this game to native English-speaking puzzle fans.

It acts as a practice for scrabble (or crossword puzzles) without any scoring (except the time taken). There is only one correct solution and finding it is done by rearranging letter tiles that either move horizontally or vertically.When you have an almost correct placement of the letters it sometimes proves frustrating to overcome that mental hurdle and find different words.My time spent in game is a smidge inflated - I occasionally left the game unattended (even overnight).Pros+ Fun, challenging word puzzle game+ Simple mechanics make it easy to learn+ Cheap when on sale (less than $1 I think)Cons- There doesn't seem to be an easy way to review completed puzzles. Often there is one last word that can be weird that is found by trial-and-error. It would be nice if the game gave you a chance to learn some of these words.- A hover over definitions of some of the exotic words would be nice.A great deal when on sale. There should be more SIMPLE and cheap puzzle games on Steam.26/10"

,Not Recommended,306680,17837631,"Posted: 1 September, 2015",all,@TwelfthDoc,"The concept of the game is a really interesting one - sudoku crossed with crosswords - however, the execution is extremely lacking.The Easy levels are timid, very quickly solved leaving one pondering if that is all the game has to offer.The Medium levels are more of a challenge, starting off as a gentle tease working up to a really difficult challenge which can only be solved by understanding how words in English are formed and having a varied and wide range of vocabualry.The Hard levels are extremely difficult, and although I welcome the challenge, the effort involved is extremely taxing on the brain and leaves one crying out for a break after about 5 minutes. The change in pace from Easy to Hard can cause whiplash.To add to the frustration, there is absolutely no replayability in this game. Once a level is complete, you're done. You can't reset the puzzle and solve it again and you can't go back to it to get a better completion time. One go at it and that's all folks.Additionally there is no explanation for any of the words later on. Granted this game is not a dictionary, but what happens if you come across a word you don't recognise before whilst completing the puzzle? e.g. As a Chemist, I understand the word ""Acyl"", which comes up in one of the later Hard courses; but not everyone would a) recognise this word immediately (as it has no vowels); and b) even if they guess this word, may not have a clue what it means.*A decent game for lexiphiles, but definitely not a game for the general public.*Acyl is a type of functional group in Organic Chemistry, which is characterised by a mandatory alkyl group attached to a carboxyl group, in the form R1-CO-R2."

The puzzles have been computer-generated using a lexicon of words that might be permitted in hardcore Scrabble tournaments, but would certainly not be common knowledge. Just playing today I've had to solve puzzles using ""SL"", ""ACYL"", and ""HOD"".It's an oversight that reflects a lack of polish and playtesting by the designers. The game is 49 cents. Buy it and beware that once in a few puzzles you'll have to jam letters into the remaining squares until you hit upon an obscure acronym.

I'm of the opinion that the puzzle should be ""how do I slide these letters to make criss-crossing words"", not ""how good am I at remembering obscure words that I'd only ever use in Scrabble"". For example, the first puzzle in the ""Hard"" category used the word ""AWN"". Are you familiar with this word? I sure wasn't. I had to look it up. It's a slender bristle that is a part of certain grasses.
