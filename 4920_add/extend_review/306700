,Recommended,306700,18584818,"Posted: 20 October, 2015",all,thetick,"This a fun little filler of game that takes place in dungeon with connecting rooms.  Your job is simply to kill all the mobs in the room and then grab the key to exit to another room.  You keep doing this until you reach the boss, which, after beating, will grant you access to the next floor.  There are four floors in this game, and runs can take you anywhere from a few minutes to a half hour, so it's great to pick up and play when you want something quick and light.There are bonus levels and shops along the way to upgrade your stats such as speed, damage, rate of fire, health, and other goodies.  If you save your money, you can buy permanent stats that will help you with future runs, which is nice since you lose everything when you die.  The neat thing is you find yourself progressing fast enough, so you don't feel like it's a long grind.Overall this is a simple game with decent replayability and just enough depth to make it enjoyable.  It's perfect for me because I like to play a few quick rounds and then come back later.  I certainly recommended this game."

Fairly challenging and so many things to collect in the form of random drops, persistant upgrades for future runs, upgrades for current run.  All the collectibles give scores based on rarity it seems, and yes this game is all about the hi-scores.  It's not a terribly long game, and hopefully the devs see some success and add a little more in the form of a New Game + or a seperate dungeon.The only thing I have found so far that disspoints  (for twin stick junkies at least)  is the lack of online coop.  But that aside, I can only praise this strangely named game.Tl:DrLooking for a rogue-lite twin stick rpg shooter? This is the one you want."

You play through different rooms across a map and can pick up power ups to defeat the different monsters. At the end of each of the levels you fight a boss. You will level up as you play more allowing you to develop your skills and get more powerful and varied items throughout the game randomly dropped from chests. If you save up you can also get a permanent gold upgrade (definately worth doing). There are also side scrolling bonus platform levels to get additional coins, a nice addition. Currently I have finished the first two levels but keep going back through from the first so I can get more gold upgrades and a better overall score. You can play local co-op but I quite enjoy this single player. I assume the game will be fairly short as after nearly 3 hours I have reached the last level, but I will take my time with it farming upgrades. I got a good deal on this game so I got about 1/3 off, but I still think it is worth the asking price as it is just so darn fun."

But whereas that game is a fast paced quarter-eater, here the pace is slower and more strategic, as well as featuring RPG-like elements such as equipment upgrades, shops and item collection. So perhaps it's more like The Binding of Isaac. Either way, it's a nice looking game with great lighting effects that works well with a controller and has a well-implemented leaderboard and achievement system, adding extra layers of addiction. A great buy for under 10 bucks."
,Recommended,306700,18258593,"Posted: 29 September, 2015",all,pepsimanvsjoe,"As many of the other reviews have stated, Iron Fisticle is similar to classic arcade games such as Robotron and Smash TV.This is a twin-stick shooter.You go in a room.You kill everything.You move onto the next.In a number of ways, this game is designed to follow Smash TV's template. Your throwing axe isn't particularly good, so you have to take every chance to get hold of the good (but temporary) weapons. This changes things from merely being about slaughter to carving a path to the next weapon, all just to capture those precious seconds of relative safety. In terms of aesthetics and mechanics, Iron Fisticle is quite appealing. The graphics are nice and clean, resembling something from the Toaplan age. The controls are perfectly solid, and the hit-box is suitable for what needs to be done. This makes for an easy game to just pick up, play, and enjoy.This game certainly isn't as difficult as Smash TV. As the store description goes, you can level-up to boost your health, abilities, and unlock new & items and weapons. Unlike seemingly every other rogue-like on Steam, these level-ups are permanent. You're free to purchase stat upgrades, so you'll start the next game with a nice boost. HP-restoring hearts are very prevalent as well. If you're particularly adept at the platforming bonus rounds, you can grab a full-healing before your next stage. Is it all really necessary? Yes and no.In standard rogue-like fashion, merely beating the game isn't enough. Sure you might have defeated some great evil and saved the legendary turnip or radish or whatever the hell it is. However, when you've accomplished your task, you get kicked back to the beginning. Everything is a little more difficult now, and your luck will run out eventually. Now here's where things get interesting. Aside from Smash TV, Iron Fisticle also takes ideas from Bubble Bobble.Within each stage, you'll find the silver weapon-holding chests, but you'll also collect a myriad of items that award points. Zombies drop food, which can award up to 800 points each. There are also special items, that are found in gold chests (one per stage). Sometimes the right special item can make a huge difference, and so can finding the right weapons. This adds a slight luck factor to the whole affair. Your dodging skills might be adept, but weapons are what keep you from getting cornered and overwhelmed. There is a dash move, which is pretty useful. However, zombies eventually roll extremely deep, and you could end up dashing into a crowd.So for most players, beating the game isn't much trouble, but going for those pesky leaderboard spots will cause headaches. Theoretically you could beat the game an innumerable amount of times without dying, but you're always one streak of bad luck away from death. If you want the top score, you'll have to play for a several hours straight. This can get pretty dull, since you'll be so strong the first 30 minutes or so won't pose any threat. Last I checked, the top-score was around 8 million, that's at least 8 play-throughs in a row. Mercifully, the challenge mode is only four stages, though luck still plays a slight factor due to food-drops and other potential bonus points (and using spare iron fists to milk the ""hurry-up"" golems). There's also playing for the shortest time, which has some merit as well.Whatever the case, Iron Fisticle's long-term replay value isn't very high. Once you hit max level (which doesn't take very long) there aren't many incentives to play the game. The normal mode takes too long to become interesting, and there's a little too much randomness to make playing for score very compelling in the challenge mode. Even with that in mind, I still give this game a recommendation. It is fun, well-constructed, and does an admirable job of blending the design philosophies of multiple classic arcade games."

Is it hard? No. It took me some getting used to. If you like unforgiving arcade style of games then you will LOVE this.I first tried with keyboard which worked okay - but once I plugged in my gamepad it felt a lot easier to play. I know the game even says at the menu screen that a gamepad is advised.If you end up buying this game KNOW THIS: As you unlock the added health and optional weapon drops that stays with you... so have hope if you end up dying a bit at first - it get's easier if you're stuck on floor one as you add more health and better weapons.Do the food drops matter? YES - freaking pick them up proudly like a BOSS! If you do you'll get a combo going which SIGNIFICANTLY improves the item drops to help you clear that room.Is it worth the money. That's your call.

I don't know, the alternatives are a bit too terrifying to contemplate and like ""why would you want an iron one of those?"" BUT what about the game?Well, it's a twin stick shooter with a bit of a nod to the recent procedural generation thing that goes on. I dunno, it's sort of an Amiga game meets Hunt-The-Wumpus style mapping meets Bezerk random mazes meets Ghosts n Goblins because why not. It's a little bit slower paced than most other twin stickers out there and the restriction of the weapons to a set number of directions instead of the full 360 can throw you off at first but all in all, it's a really enjoyable and chilled little game.Due to the ever increasing amount of stats you'll be improving as you play it does have the slightly weird thing where it gets easier and easier as you progress and doesn't seem to adjust the game drastically to compensate it's still a game about hitting zombies in the face with an axe and then exploding a spider because who doesn't want to explode spiders.I enjoyed it a lot and I guess that's all that matters in the end. It's a game that's happy to be and it does what it does tremendously well. That, really, is all it needs to be."

It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it doesn't improve on it either.You shoot the same zombies over and over and over. Mages appear a little later that shoot bullets, but it gets so crowded that you might not survive to where there is more enemy variety. I picked it up to play some casual co-op with a friend, so I didn't intend to practice to get far. So we didn't.The game lacks a certain punch to it. Know that sound and feel when you get a hit in Super Smash Bros, esp. on the N64? Yeah, there isn't that here. You just, somehow, throw AXES at a machine-gun pace and it does a barely-audible *tick*. Game feel is very important.There is a lack of classes - there is only one. A thing I really enjoyed in the new Gauntlet remake was that one player could use the Valkyrie and shield your archer or mage teammate. Then the mage can slow enemies down so that they can be easier to handle melee. We would call when we'd prepare a move before the enemies spawned. That was really cool teamwork dynamic. None of that here.Items are for the most part useless. You get a staggering amount of drops from enemies, which then gets annoying since it does nothing but give you points. This is 2016, I'm playing in my living room not in an arcade gallery. Nobody is gonna look over and say OMG YOU GOT SO MANY POINTS!I know that it tries to recreate that style of arcady old-school game, but even then points never got in the way of the gameplay. You would kill enemies and get points automatically. But in this game you get drops that seem useful (to level up, for instance?), but only serve to distract from the enemies and give no gameplay benefit.Oh! Is that a book? Awesome! I must get some kind of cool spell ability! *grabs book* 100 POINTS! *gets killed by projectile while distracted*In terms of aesthetics, it is also okay but nothing to write home about. Cute pixel-art. Music is forgettable (see Shovel Knight). Sound lacks punch. Level design is square and bare. Average.IN CONCLUSION : a game that falls short of expections and becomes quickly boring despite the potential and attractiveness of the trailer.Score : 6.5/10RECOMMENDATION : Get on sale if you have a buddy that likes mob swarm twin-stick shooters to play Co-Op.

This all combines to deliver a real sense of achievement, and adds to replayability. I'm not sure whether I will still think that once I complete the game, as right now I haven't - it is pretty hard. I am also not that fond of the boss fights which can descend into bullet-hell shoot-em-up territory, but otherwise this game is great.Avoid if you do not have a controller though, kb control is unsatisfactory!!EDIT: The game now resets after you kill the final boss and you now loop it at a higher difficulty.

There is no reason to miss it, especially on sales!I am actually a bit surprised that only 3 people from my friendslist have this wonderful Arcade Game.It is very easy to learn, but also very difficult to master. The strong point is definitely the perfect controls, the speed and the replayability and when you die, you will know the reason. So, everything depends on your personal skills.You start in one room and you have to kill everything that spawns in there, then you move on to the next room, which will be a bit more difficult. In between you collect coins, diamonds, new weapons, etc. With the coins you can buy upgrades (permanent and non permanent) in a shop. Little 2D Jump N Run sequences allow you to collect even more coins.The game has also a simple, but useful upgrade / exp mechanism. With higher levels, you are able to get more diverse and more powerful weapons which facilitate every single run until only your skill will count.At the moment the game is on sale for 1,79 EUR. This is a mere steal for such a great arcade shooter. You might not play it for hours and hours, but it is really one of those I just like to play for three, four rounds in between of other games.Do not miss it. It is perfect for what it wants to be.

Unlike Smash TV, you can level up stats to help you do so.Some in-game items will take stats up for that play only, and you can also max your base stats out to about 50 percent of its upper max for starting out. That gives you some incentive for playing at first, and you can tell the difference when speed, attack power, attack speed, and more goes up.It has about 4 levels of play, and completing that starts it over, with the enemies getting faster.

Skeptical of cheap games I expected the game to be filled with bugs, more crashes than a stock car race and really bad game play. I was genuinely surprised at how well thought out this game is.Iron Fisticle is a Dungeon crawling shooter game where you battle through 4 Levels (which aren't easy). This game has a level of difficulty to it and provides a nice leveling up system with permanent and temporary character upgrades. One of they games where you can actually notice an improvement in your character, and player skill - which is very rewarding.However, my cons are is that once you become an highly ranked character is that the game could become easy as there is only 4 levels (which is the ultimate outcome if you grind games). There is another mode, which at the current time I haven't dived into. The mode is basically the same as the normal mode, but you do not gain permanent upgrades - so Binding of Isaac.Conclusion: for how cheap the game is, it's perfect. I believe all the other reviews are positive. If I was the developer of a relatively (review based) successful game I would be pushing as much content out the door as possible! This game exceeds the warrant to release DLC or sequel."

The game balance isn't perfect, but it's balanced better than any of those three antecedents.Keyboard play is basically impossible on a normal keyboard, since there's no mouseaim and it needs to bind both a 4-way move and 4-way shoot, plus it's possible to want to move diagonally while also shooting diagonally. Most keyboards do not do a good job of four simultaneous inputs.It also couldn't read my non-XInput gamepad directly, so I ended up using JoyToKey to have the gamepad trigger the keyboard controls. It ended up being worth the hassle, but don't get this game if you don't have a gamepad at all."

Essentially a mash-up between classic Robotron-style gameplay and an RPG-style upgrade system, there is a lot of fun to be had here. Plus there's a story about some dude chasing his stolen food!"

,Recommended,306700,34535890,Posted: 27 August,all,Managedant,Love these Devs and I LOVE their publisher.  Tikipod really brings out the smiles when it comes to games.Anyways.  It's a fun multiplayer twin stick old school arcade shooter with random side scrolling bits thrown in to spice it up.Fun to play with friends and at a price point I don't mind recommending.I would have gladly paid for this again had I not already owned Fisticle and got it for free.Very easy to recommend this game as I enjoyed Fisticle very much.
