There are misspelled words and some of the jokes are very lame. One of my quests is buggy. But you know what? I don't care! Regardless of all that, the story is still fun and the card battles are incredibly addicting. If you like fantasy settings or card games or stories that poke fun at themselves, you'll probably enjoy this quite a bit. And the best part - the achievements work just fine! If you're thorough in your exploring, it's fairly easy to get a perfect game in one playthrough. So if you don't mind an unpolished game, look for this on sale and snap it up. This is one game I'm very happy I decided to buy."

I literally did everything I could, fought every battle visited every location cleared every arena and got every achievement. The game could be finished easily a lot faster than my own clocked hours,I was crawling and searching through the dust hoping for more content.What is here is really solid, good battle system, a decent selection of cards.Replayability? Little to none, personally I doubt I will play through this again. There are no random encounters, just scripted story encounters. There are the arena battles which personally I found the most interesting as some of them had unique foes that could be a bit more challenging.Difficulty wise overall I would say it is a bit on the easy side. Not too bad but there is no difficulty setting option so one size fits all in this case beginner to veteran.So to summarise-Do I regret buying this game?=Not at all, I did enjoy the time I played it.Is  it value for money?=Overall yes, cheaper than a movie and prob about twice as long without hurrying. Though there are better value for money games out there at this price or less. I would probably wait for a 50% off sale on itWould I recommend you buy it?=Conditionally yes, just don't go into with huge expectations. I would say most people will play through once, enjoy it and shelve it. Without a multiplayer or random battles it is not long enough to warrant a replay.It is unfortunate as what's here is good.Hopefully some of that helps, hopefully some of that makes sense ;P"
,Recommended,307010,33457697,Posted: 11 July,all,Two Clicks,"BITESIZE:SIMILAR GAMEPLAY TO:Hero of the KingdomWHAT TO EXPECT:Very short. Story-driven objectives. Fantasy setting. Overhead map movement. Minor RPG elements. 31 locations to visit, some with multiple areas.  196 card deck battle system.  Limited number of basic puzzles. Virtually zero replayability value.ACHIEVEMENTS:EASY.STATUS:COMPLETE.WHEN TO BUY:ON A SALE.More info below....THE LOWDOWN:Northmark: Hour of the Wolf is a short fantasy quest-oriented, adventure game with RPG elements, minor puzzles and a card-driven combat system.  Travel across a fairly detailed map.  Visit thirty-one locations.  Talk to quest giving characters.  Complete them, search for hidden stashes or fight in the arenas to obtain money.  Spend cash on buying cards from stores and specialist buildings to increase the potency of the battle deck and possible deck-building strategies.Cards can also be found in secret stashes or given when completing quests.  Fight battles with up to three units and action cards to destroy the enemy forces arrayed opposite.  Complete the game by visiting every location, defeating your foes in many battles and finding out who is the secret evil power rising to bring chaos to the lands of Northmark.THE GOOD:+ Good graphics and artwork.+ Many race-based sets of battle [196] cards across; Paladin, Elf, Dwarf, Hobbit and Barbarian races.+ Solid, balanced card decks provide for some engaging battles.+ Well devised and written narrative, emparted mostly through dialogue.+ Use of arenas provides additional non-critical chances to battle and review the state of the current battle deck.+ Mostly easy and straightforward achievements.THE BAD:- Could have done with voice-overs for the dialogue.- No real replayability.  Though short enough to replay someday.- Its very short.- To basic.  Could have done with some more locations and areas to visit, puzzles to solve.- Only one basic soundtrack.AND THE ORDINARY:* Battle mechanics are solid but limited.* Needed more puzzles.  There are only a few dozen secrets and treasure chest puzzles, to mix up the adventure.* Missions are nothing special, mostly sequential and most require a battle to complete.* Minor RPG elements where the main character can be levelled with battle stats upgraded.* Manual and autosave.  But with only five slots.VERDICT:Northmark: Hour of the Wolf provides a fun if albeit all to brief experience.  Graphics and artwork are pleasant enough to look at, capturing the setting adequately.  The story is enjoyable enough to keep you playing. While exploring the map and uncovering new locations and secret stash helps retain interest between battles. Controls and audio are also good enough if nothing special.Its not the most complicated game, yet possesses enough detailed mechanics to provide basic strategy and tactical challenges when conducting battles.  The range of cards is somewhat limited with categories consisting of: buffs/debuff, attack, defense, paralysing, healing, dual and multiple-value and, specialist cards for the final battle.  Players will end up upgrading cards in their deck to include the best of each type and use them in pretty much the same way depending on the circumstances of the current battle.  Its the opposition and the cards that are drawn for use that make each battle different from the last.  The card decks and battle system is undoubtably the game's best feature.It could have done with some voice-overs for the narrative portions of story told by dialogue.  There is also practically zero replayability unless you just want to play for the enjoyment of it.  Its just an average but solid game.  Fans of casual games or achievement hunters/ completionists should probably check this out.  Especially if they enjoy fantasy settings and games with card-based combat.  Serious gamers probably wont be bothered with wasting 5-10hours when they could be playing something else.If youre still interested I would suggest waiting for a good sale purely for its lack of replayability."

While this is simple all is very good.Definitely something that will deliver few hours of fun.Game is not being developed further - author stated that sales were less than satisfactory and it's quite understandable.I have similar issue with my games here on Steam and I don't really know how to solve it - I have put a link on my own game page.

I beat the game just shy of four hours. Difficulty curve vanishes after you 'figure it out.' Would also be nice to have a text speed option; lots of clicking to get through dialogue.I still recommend as a good/fun game, and the price is fair. Interresed to see if they expand/develop a new (bigger) story line at some point...EDIT: The fact this game is short could actually be a PRO, because now I actually feel like I've completed a game in my library :)"
76561197965396869,Not Recommended,307010,11607432,"Posted: 8 August, 2014",all,Macdallan,"Really short, not great.  The writers tried to be funny and failed.  Other dialogue is dreadfully mediocre and poor at best.  There is very limited strategy to the game.  Most fights are really easy but a few are a bit rough if you tackle them too early unless you spent your points in the right places.  Usually I just buff the snot out of one stompy unit and focus attacks on one enemy unit at a time.  I also couldn't see the point in spending many stat points on defence since the faster I kill off one of the enemy's units the sooner I'd win the fight.  Focus on attack and spread those points around to several different damage types and you're guaranteed to hurt anything you hit - even if only for a few points.Even though it's not a great game something made me stick with it until I played the whole thing through.  If you like card-based RPG game mechanics, can put up with bad writing and a poor story line with ""twists"" you can see coming way before the game ""reveals"" them, so-so graphics and generally a *meh* feeling all the way through you should buy this one.  On sale.  Like 80% off.  Or more.  Yeah, can't recommend this - you've been warned."

,Recommended,307010,11537454,"Posted: 3 August, 2014",all,raixel,"I normally stay away from card based games, but this is a cute little one. Its really easy though, and seems to be a mobile port. Besides that, its pretty fun. The rules are simple to learn, each stat has an attack and a defense, so like 3 fire magic -2 fire defense is 1 point. Theres basic attack/defense and then ice, fire, and poison. Your hero, of which there is a few classes to determine your starting cards and stats, also has base stats which boost the cards. You wander around a map, each location has little icons you can click (and hidden ones too with gold you have to search for). Theres also riddle chests (like in Betrayal at Krondor, one of the best RPGs of the 90s). The riddles are easy, but fun.The combat is all card based. YOu have a group of 12 cards that is your deck, and you can get ""unit cards"" which have a level. You can pick up to three units, as long as their levels combined isnt above a set number. So if your number is 10, you can have 2 5th level units, or a 5 a 4 and a 1, or 2 4s and a 2, and so forth.Its really easy to understand and pretty fun - if simple and kind of easy. The only complaint I have is no matter if you pick the obviously female Ice Mage character, all the text refers to you as ""he"". Annoying."
,Not Recommended,307010,19408486,"Posted: 1 December, 2015",all,Fuji,"First of all, I like card games.  Let me tell you why I didn't like this one.The card pool is small, and the cards aren't satisfying.  In layman's terms, they just don't do cool things.  They do damage (if you're lucky), they heal a small amount, they have a half♥♥♥♥♥buff that sort of helps.The story is... bad.  And short.Did I mention the game is short?There are no unique scenarios, every fight is pretty much the same.  Whittle the enemy numbers by focusing on one unit at a time.There is no SWEET LOOT!  Sometimes you'll get a card or a unit, but like most TCG the majority of the cards are trash and your deck pool is pretty limited.  The units have different stats, some are better than others, but they all function the same.  No fun stuff!The starting characters are pretty lame, and there's no replayability.  No customization, the variety of token in nature.  You also don't really level up enough for the stats to even make a strategic difference.Your deck isn't limited by theme or anything strategic of the sort.  Have the best paladin unit?  Use a dwarf spell on his turn to attack and do a couple points of damage!If you're wondering where my gripes are coming from, and I will leverage my complaints about the cards being simple and lame by suggesting you look at ""Card City Nights"" instead of this game.  That game is short too, but the card variety, encounter variety, card pool, deck size, and strategy/mechanic/playstyles offered are a class above this game.  Card City Nights makes Northmark look like a steaming turd.Anyway, truth be told, I do not regret purchasing this game. In fact, I played it and had a good time. But I'm still not recommending it because it feels like an IOS game (which it probably is) and is sorely lacking in all departments."

The dialogue for the most part is well presented aswell, a few spelling mistakes here and there but nothing major.The main thing i wanted to talk about is something i feel is just casually mentioned and brushed past. That is of course the length and content of the game. my play time is not representitive of how long the game is since i am not very good, went afk, needed to retry several encounters multiple times and run around each shop looking for those cards to give me an edge.I think the content of the game is around 3 hours, you fight very similar battles and multiple tries help inflate the game but for pure content i think 3 hours is about right.I cant help but feel that the game had more to offer and just didnt deliver on it, like the game was pushed out the door early or just not enough care and attention was put into it. I understand its an indie title and its only £5.50 (7 if not on sale) but there are indie titles around that price that have far more content then this one has and far more replayability. By the end of it i just felt like i was missing that little bit more.whether the game is worth the price for the content it offers is very much personal preference and you can decide that for yourself. If this game was more expensive i would not recommend it to you but it gave me a few hours of fun for just over five pounds. I dont feel ripped off, just a little disappointed. If you enjoy these kind of games then absolutely give it a try."

Suitable for the price.Pros:-Simple but compelling gameplay.-The art style is well suited to this game.-Amusing writing style.Cons:-Few enemies.  You fight the SAME units over and over.  The final battle was split into two against the villian, but both times he had the SAME three units.  Dull.-Few units.  You have access to the same units as the enemy, just even fewer.  They're in tiers, so a lot of the low level ones become moot before you can even get them.-Few spells/attacks.  Everything gets more powerful as the hero's stats get added to damage.

I would definetly buy the next game that continoues the story in hope in that game they fix a couple of problems that the game have.The BIGGEST PROBLEM this game have is the writing. It is soooo bad it kills the great story events. For example of the great story and pacing and the bad writing that kills it. At a point in game you get an item that is soo odd it just sticks to your mind that you have it but so insignificant that it is not shown anywhere on your stats and you quickly forget about it. However at a later stage where you meet a challange that looks so daunting and puts you in a mindset that there is noway this can be solved easilly they bring up that item earlier and it fits sooo  well in the development in the story that it really leaves you with a great satisfing feeling. However the very words they describe the details of this recive and give events are soo poorly picked and mixed it totally kicks you out of the immersionand you just want to delete the game in your frustration. It's like they tell you about a superbadass event about to happen and you get excited and when it comes they like text you with some lol leet words and you just feel the pain...The characters and the visual representation on the characters are super fun and i liked them all. I cant really point out a single character (even minor plot ones) that didn't stick to me. Theire picture, and the story behind them makes them unique and fun to meet or go back to. Sadlly the wrinting is still♥♥♥♥♥♥ maybe on a different language the game is not that bad, but the english version is dreadfull. So astheticlly the game is soo good it really helps you  feel trough the story and even if it looks low resolution the feelings and personalities come trough instnatly helping you with instant immersion in the conversation, that is killed instantly with the poor writing. However the jokes are really good and personalised wich means all jokes in the game gets an extra boost and makes you laugh beacuse they fit to the situation really well, also some jokes are set up trough huge gaps in the game and really well ties up the certain portions of the game into one whole well paced story. That is thrown off the bridge do drown by the terrible english writing...The combat. Has a lot of different playstyles and you can perfectly bulid up your dream combo whatever it might be a full i wont be damaged style, or the I outheal and remove all♥♥♥♥♥♥you might throw at me style, or the I will oblibarete you in 1 turn style, or I lock down you and chip you to death style or just something I didnt come up with style. Soo many well made cool mechanics, BUT IT IS BROKEN AS ♥♥♥♥ the combat is turned based and the one goes second have NO redeaming mechanics. There is absolutelly nothing that makes up for the fact that someone goes second. And it is so broken that way that the devs literally cheating by ALWAYS make you go first. Always... So while the combat is so diversed it can be challanging or a complete stomp but beacuse you go with a cheat in an unballanced already game mechanic you will never feel you worked for your win. However when you pull off your uber combo that you bulided up so far you feel badass regardless and kinda makes you forget how wastly overpowered you are. The AI have huge holes in it where some spells causes them to focus target something else and thus making your other chaaracters invurnable since you unlikelly to be attackd there. THERE IS ONE MORE super broken part of the game. If your enemy or yourself miss a single unit out of the 3 then that means you completly miss out as much turns. Wich sounds okay that 3 can gank up on 1 but since the spells have no costs so you can spam lvl 5 spells continously with a lvl 1 unit using your hero that means you can WASTLY overpower any opponent.So all and all the combat wont get in your way and it is diversed enough that you forget how ridiciluslly unballanced it is.Oh and the chracter progression leveling system is♥♥♥♥♥♥ just straight up crap. Absolutelly useless. Doesnt matter where you click or what oyu pick AT ALL.The game also have a few unique features that i never seen anywhere else and they fit nicelly in the game. There are secret point and click things in the game wich gives you little treats, enough to makes you want  to search for them. There is a chest ""hacking"" system too that is really easy but compelling makes you feel smart a bit. Also there are secrets that is only accesible if you really try hard to get to them.

I found myself wanting more, and hope they release a small patch for the erros, grammar, and spelling. In summary, while certain small issues were evident, the game as a whole is good. Hopefully, they'll patch the game when they release the expansion, which I hope they do."

I only hope that they build upon it, be it via updates or expansion packs as the game could be longer with more side quests.You build an 'army' out of cards, with more cards that determine actions. Not your typical card game, as you set your army going into the battle, with the deck actually being what makes up your actions. Your selections in your army have importance as well, for they may have their own card abilities that they can play on on their turn.No regrets in my purchasing it."

At times, it's so bad, that it's actually good. (Like a ""b movie,"" sometimes it's exactly what you're in the mood for) It's got a lot of charm, as another reviewer mentioned. The writing is at times genuinely funny, and the story isn't bad, but there are also some amusingly bad typos, and just horrendously written passages (you may actually enjoy the awful translation, as I did). The main problem, as widely mentioned, is the lack of difficulty, so I suggest you challenge yourself by using *weaker cards* or leveling your character in a useless, handicapping way. Aside from that, the gameplay is really pretty good. It's supported by VERY strong art... I really enjoyed the art style and the interface... and very good music/sound (yes, it could've used a couple more battle tracks for sure, but what's there is very good). Not sure what else to say, it tends to get a bit better and less linear as it progresses. Looks like I got 6 hours out of it, which isn't bad. I *may* one day actually come back and play it again.I don't regret spending the $10 on it, but objectively speaking, it is slightly overpriced. If it's on sale, and/or you're in the right mood for something casual/silly, I would say get it."

It's not especially deep, but for the indie budget, it's a smart and simple little game.  It will only keep you busy for about 5-6 hours... I replayed a good chunk of it to get the treasure chest achievement since I'd bypassed the first one the first time around, and had to play through a good chunk of the game to get all of the chests a second time.  If you're like me, you'll enjoy the game, but wish that it was much longer.  It also seems a bit deceptive that the world map is about 2-3 times bigger than it needs to be, with an enormous part of it going unused.  Not sure if the intention was to allow for expansions or DLC, but no word yet on either.  6/10"

76561198130948719,Recommended,307010,31390081,Posted: 27 April,all,Gamboleer,A lighthearted story-based RPG card adventure with simple mechanics that are easily learned through playing. The card game doesn't have a ton of depth; it's mostly about buffing your units and attacking while they're strong rather than grand strategy. Worth about $3.
