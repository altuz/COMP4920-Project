The story is sweet and cute, and two main characters are fully voiced, which certainly adds to its appeal.However, Shan Gui has no dialogue choices or multiple endings one might except from a VN, although in its case it is sort of fitting, and I can’t think of any place where I would’ve changed the story. But those who don’t mind the lack of interactivity will be rewarded with a beautiful story."

So it should be a proud event. However, from now, it's nothing but the biggest shame for every Chinese VN fan.Who to blame? Only the publisher, ""Ju Cai"". Simply speaking, Ju Cai took developer's lack of experience as a loophole,    pocketed all the profits, and won the legal strife with Valve's intervention.Now this game may well not be out of stock again, but Magenta Factory, the developer, have declared they won't give up getting Shan Gui's authorship right back. I bet not till then...(Now is 2017. It seems like quite a lot of rookie players have got relieved from or just forgot the last scandal. I dunno if it's a good sign, for justice is now far from getting dispensed. Maybe you'll see me as a freak, but there goes a Chinese saying: ""Justice naturally inhabits everyone's heart."")As for the game content, just check out those earlier reviews, I'm not gonna wasting your time here.Summary:Game itself:7/10Publisher:SUCH A NEGATIVE ♥♥♥♥♥♥/10Developer:May the righteousness be with you.DO NOT.

,Recommended,307050,11930561,"Posted: 30 August, 2014",all,Tutty The Fruity,"A charming indie addition to the Steam VN library.It's a small package, clocking in at under 2 hours, which is acceptable given the price point of $5. Bear in mind that this is a static VN, without gameplay or decision-making, simply a story to experience. It's up to your discretion if the price of content justifies a purchase. I can say that those two hours are well spent.Criticisms primarily pertain to elements of the voiceacting. You may want to adjust the sound settings in option and turn the music down a bit, as both of the VAs are, for the most part, very quiet, and the music may drown out their performances. Furthermore, the protagonist is consistently lacking any sort of enthusiasm; in comparison, her new friend, while similarly quiet, has moments of excitement suited to the demeanour of a child, and when she sings it's a delight. That said, the voiceacting is more often a benefit than a detractor to the experience. Auto-scrolling is perfectly timed to the voice acting.Perhaps some of the cultural specifics of the region could have been conveyed better through dialogue. Links are provided to articles as aids to understanding the region, its history and various mythological concepts. They're okay to thumb through upon invitation, but not seemingly necessary for enjoyment of the experience.The UI is standard, perfectly functional, and requires no introduction. I recommend the use of Quick Saves to allow the story to continue to flow.The settings are beautiful and excellent captures of the Chinese landscapes. Your mileage may vary with the characters and hand-drawn scenes themselves, but transitions allow both sides of the visual coin to compliment one another. The descriptive writing also helps the user fill in any blanks, creating a general sense of tranquility that goes hand in hand with a visual tour of Purple Mountain. The English translation is competent enough to carry that sense across to English readers.I do not feel the plot is anything to write home about; it is a modest story, as the author says. However, it is a product of love, a captivating experience, a simple journey and an look at a new world for many of us; it's about seeing the beauty in everything.I recommend it to anyone who's a fan of visual novels in particular. If anything here piqued your interest, you should read it too. It requires little investment of time and money and the experience is captivating."

,Recommended,307050,14787282,"Posted: 7 March, 2015",all,Praxis-[CE],"For a travel guide, the sexual tension is pretty impressive!Shan Gui is a really short visual novel (a visual short story maybe?) with lush artwork and beautiful music. Beautifully voiced entirely in Chinese, the translation isn't perfect but it isn't so bad that it becomes a distraction.  The story is simple and engaging, and I thought it was interesting that the game actually links to wikipedia entries on the actual locations and lore mentioned in the story. I do use ""game"" in a loose sense here, because this is definitely more of a novel than a game. There aren't choices to be made, you just click to progress the dialogue through the linear story.For the completionists, Shan Gui has strong Steam integration with super easy achievements and a game that can be completed in a very short amount of time. I didn't actually see the short story and lack of replayability as a bad thing, but I got the game deeply discounted and I feel like the content was worth what I spent. The extras include a gallery of the gorgeous artwork found in the game, as well as the soundtrack.Shan Gui does really feel a bit like a travel and cultural guide though.

The main reason for this comment is that I think this game is overvalued, my mark is 5.5/10 (6 is a pass).Story: 6/10. The story is sensitive, easy to recall the childhood memory, and the localization work is praiseworthy. However, the story is too short and lacking necessary links, which makes playing this game like switching different scenes and scanning different CGs.   The writing style of Chinese version(the native speaker version) is too close to Japanese, that disappointed me a little.Art: 6.5/10. A typical Japanese manga style, colorful and good backgrounds. But I think the art designer is not good at drawing people, especially characters in different ages and human body proportion.Music: 7/10. Soft songs, and free OST for listening.Voices: 4/10. I closed the voice when I hear the vocal of He Jia until the end, so this score is biased. As a leading character, the voice of He Jia lacks emotion, which is a big problem on GAL.Gameplay: 2/10. No gameplay at all. Playing this game is a half-hour clicking without any choices.To be honest, I do not recommend this game even though it is 50% OFF now. In my personal view, Shan Gui is much more like a short visual fiction( I had to wait another half hour after the end for the card!) than a GAL game and its high price makes everything worse. As other comments said, it is only recommended for card traders and perfect game seekers.---End----------下面是中文评测-------2015年4月的更新：制作组在这段时间里加了别的语言，加了个别的视觉小说的广告和新成就，还重新做了女主之外人员的配音。不过……我配音意见最大好像还是女主，然后木有改= = 而且其它的黑点依然没变，所以我这里也依然保持差评o(￣ヘ￣o＃)---原评测分割线---之所以决定入这个游戏，一开始是因为看到某位友邻的评测。之后到商店看了一下，觉得差评里无脑黑太多，所以决定玩一下看看。玩完之后觉得给个中评比较合适，但又回到商店一看居然是85%好评……所以给差评完全是为了拉评价以免让别人跳坑。优点：1.故事走轻小说风格，没大槽点（如果搞姬不算槽点），对一些人而言应该有种特殊的亲切感；多语言好评。2.UI什么的很不错，精美细致；背景虽然是PS+参考照片但还是有一定的水准。3.音乐还可以，轻柔舒缓的风格，平时也可以当工作学习BGM；而且不要钱。4.全成就很容易达成，掉卡速度也能接受（虽然也挂了20分钟左右的机）缺点：1.故事太短，点点点的话十几分钟通关；剧情推进和转折都稍微有些生硬，莫名其妙的就通关了，而且灵异元素什么的……2.我猜人设一定是个男的，不然画不出那样的萝莉。虽然上色技巧还ok，但是CG与立绘中的人体比例和年龄感实在是硬伤……3.配音实在是出戏……妹子说了几句话之后我就怒关语音了（不好意思= =）。4.有些细节问题啊……明明是国人做的游戏，简中版的男女NPC叫“男子”“女子”不行么？“Man”和“Girl”真是太雷了……总体来说这游戏如果要是在10RMB左右还是可以的，5刀的定价未免太坑了；虽然现在在半价，不过我觉得买了也只是不亏而已，从某些方面来说还是鸡肋……只推荐给卡贩子、成就爱好者和没钱买游戏表情的玩家。P.S.大概看了一下评价，感觉外国人民的评测虽然也很水，但认真写评测的的比例相对高一些（因为外国普通玩家不会特意玩这种游戏吧）。还有虽然不了解这游戏的制作者有什么问题，但我个人觉得只为了制作组就无脑黑也有点中二。"

,Recommended,307050,14579436,"Posted: 21 February, 2015",all,サマエル,"""Shan Gui is a short, linear, kinetic visual-novel set in Nanjing's gorgeous Purple Mountain.""This is the admirably honest description on the Store page, a kind of honesty not easily found on the official description.First things first: a kinetic visual-novel is one in which the player can't interact with the (linear) story, so don't expect this to be a VN proper; in other words, this is not a game - rather, it's a non-interactive mixed-media experience, and a rather good one at that.It takes about an hour to complete, more if going through the Wiki links (more on this later), and even more if you'll take your time to sit (sometimes quite literally) and enjoy some of the little... ""atemporalities"" (pardon me) it offers. The replay value is absent - because this is not a game, bear with my redundancy - but this doesn't mean you won't find yourself drawn to re-experience some of the aforementioned time bubbles.The story may appear a little plain/slow to the Westerner's eye, especially in the very beginning, but it catches up quickly; on the other hand, those acquainted with the East Asian cultural sphere and its peculiar mindset will take great pleasure on the many references - some rather obvious, others less so. This is why I strongly suggest to break the immersion and check out the Wikipedia links provided in-game (and perhaps follow up on those when the story is over).The translation is decent both in English and German, there are some grammar errors and there's a certain ingenuity in the choice of words, with some nuances irremediably lost in translation. Both characters display some degree of naïveté, however, which makes that ingenuousness somehow fitting. The voice acting is fine as far as I'm concerned; 'tis certainly not the best I've ever heard, but it serves its purpose well enough. Another reviewer said that ""the protagonist is consistently lacking any sort of enthusiasm"", which can hardly be denied - but, given the plot, I think it may have been intended.As to the ""art"" department, I found the soundtrack remarkable, the sound effects rather good and their timing effective. The backgrounds are gorgeus, and most of them can be ""visited"" using Google Earth's street view; the artwork is solid, although some scenes have the protagonists overly-sexualised, and while I realise that some if not most will welcome such a thing, I found it rather out-of-place. An utter buzzkill, actually, although that's pretty much the only real downside I stumbled upon during the whole experience, and it is an understandable marketing (and cultural) choice. Thankfully such buzzkills are not that common, and they ultimately had little impact on my enjoyment.What else can be said? The controls are smooth and so are the transitions; the game can be run in fullscreen up to 1920x1080; 16:10 isn't supported, resulting in movie-like black bands on the top and bottom - not an issue due to the nature of the product (as in, a kinetic VN as opposed to a game). I suggest using headphones for a better experience, if only for the cicadas and thunderstorm.---Did I enjoy it? Far more than I would've expectedWill I go back to it again? Yep.Would I recommend it? Absolutely, and quite frankly I felt it was a steal at a 1,69€ sale, given that even with its shortcomings I'd still buy it at its full pricetag (4,99€), retrospectively.But do keep in mind that this game is not for everyone, although I think I made that rather clear in this review."

The voice acting borders on average, the music is touching and the scenes are breath-taking.  The plot itself involves a female tourist being guided by her mysterious friend (another girl) to real locations in the mountains.  (Think ""Go Go Nippon!"" but in China).The whole experience is like reading a short romance comic while listening to classical music in the background.Personally, I can only wish that the friendship (relationship) between the two main characters was explored in greater detail.  This can be somewhat of a disappointment especially for Yuri fans, unless the writer intends to make a continuation!All in all, it's as short and straight-forward as a kinetic novel can get.  There are no choices to be made to influence the story.  Depending on how fast you read, you can finish the entire novel in an hour or less, at the same time, take in all the achievements with no effort.   These factors may be pros for some, and cons for others.Considering the novel's length and it's price (it's better when on sale!) then Shan Gui is a good deal."

I have so many games and reached the point where I agreed not to buy any new ones until A - I had completed or at least tried a lot of the games I currently have or B could justify buying it. A bundle had 2 or 3 of my wish list games on so I had to take that chance.That being said I still had no real idea what to expect from this title as I installed it. I decided to just jump into it, and I'm glad I did.In simple terms this is a Chinese story of a girl (Han Hui) who decides to visit areas of her past (for reasons explained in the story that I do not want to give away), and upon her journey she meets a wonderous child (He Jia) who claims to be local and aids in Han Hui's adventure. Through their adventure which lasts only a day they help each other with their problems and become very close, though through it all not everything is as it seems.I really don't want to give the story away so please forgive the basic description. Just know that if you like Chinese fables, beautiful scenery with well drawn images, don't mind slightly broken English and have a few hours spare then this is worth a try.The translation of Shan Gui is Mountain Expensive....which leaves me puzzled (about the expensive part). I know some Chinese so I double checked but found it to be true. Still, that isn't something to be put off by.Additional Note - All achievements are easily received. 7 come from the story and 1 comes from watching the credits.

A good 50% of it boils down to brief descriptions of some mountains/paths in China with Wikipedia hyperlinks. There is also some very barebones plot that is nothing more than a girl showing another girl around the area with a brief stop to get tea. It takes about 30 minutes (I'd guess 45 if you're a slow reader) to go from start to finish. There is also some very bad voice acting thrown in. It just sounds so bland and uninspired. On the plus side some of the artwork is nice but that's about all the praise I can give it unfortunately.

Character art, not so much. Music was good. Voice acting, not so much. The English translation was definitely subpar, worse than most, which is a problem in a game where the only gameplay is reading. It's linear, no choices. Add in a weak plotline and the fact it was over in 45 minutes, gives you the recipie for a game I can't recommend.On a more positive note, it has cards, some decent profile backgrounds, and it's an easy perfect for achievements. If I had sold the cards, the game might have paid for itself. The problem is, the cards and achievements are where the game's value is, not the game itself.I'm digging VN's, and I approach each one I experience with an open mind.

Like the description states, Shan Gui is flat; there are no choices or decisions that alter your ending, thus having no ""replay value"" either.The engine, as most visual novels, is Ren'py, so expect a familiar interface; quick load/save, load/save files (not really needed), text speed options, skipping seen text, auto text and a speed option, etc.As someone who has played a large number of visual novels, and I prefer them to be kinetic anyhow, I can't recommend this VN. Despite buying it 50% off for $2.50, the thirty minutes I spent reading it (and there after leaving it on for the trading cards) I can't say it was worth my money. I felt dissatified with the, like many said, ""childish"" ending. Sure, Shan Gui had it's sweet moments, and a relaxing atmosphere, but I couldn't bring myself to like plot. It wasn't as ""touching"" as I hoped, it wasn't really touching at all.The music is great and the CGs are wonderfully done, though some may not appreciate the art style (like one person said, ""dorito eyes""). However, there definitely are some inconsistenciess. But that's not what bothered me. I felt that some moments of the story were ruined by the sexualized art. Han Hui, a college student, does have noticeable affection towards He Jia, a girl that appears to be around 12 or 13. Somehow what seemed to be innocent in the text itself, with the images, it gave a that vibe Han Hui had a sexual attraction towards her. The CG of He Jia in her panties (actually there's...two), didn't help with that. It felt awkward, if anything.The voice acting in Shan Gui is a nice addition, despite it being a bit muffled at times. Han Hui is unfortunately monotone throughout, but He Jia is done rather nicely. Voices can be turned off if it bothers you. And as others have said, the translations are somewhat poor, but there is going to be a patch later on, redoing the translation. The wiki links provided in the text is nice though, providing background information to what many people would not be familar with.The other extras are pretty nice though.There are trading cards are worth around $0.60 cents a piece, and you get 3 of them for just buying the game. There is also a free OST. And like most said, getting 100% in achievements is extremely easy, just play once and watch the credits in the extra menu.Shan Gui isn't a bad VN by all means, but it just wasn't for me. Even for a $2.50 price tag, it felt a bit steep for the 30 minutes I wasted, and I couldn't get myself into it. The game suffers from some minor inconsistencies, translation errors, and quality of the voice acting, which might bother some. But it might be worth a shot for those who would like a short, relaxing, sweet visual novel."

So there's a couple of reasons to try it.The story (which i won't go into), was cute, but nothing special. It did have a little (kinda predictable) surprise at the end though. It was a resonabe story, only lasting around 40min's, but it was a relaxing & entertaining 40min's. The story also had Wikipedia-Links for some of the more famous landmarks & legends mentioned during the story, which i thought was a nice touch, & helped give history & tourist info to the non-chinese reader/player (?).The art was similarly adequate, but not awe-inspiring. Manga style still pics of character models were nice, but nothing flashy. While oil-paint type background pics, would show the landscapes mentioned in the story.Overall, i liked Shan Gui, even though it had no direct player/reader (?) interaction other than clicking when wanting to read a new line of text, & advance the story. I'm not sure what the full-price is, but it was definatly worth the $1.50 that i paid. Even though it was under 1hr of play/read (?) time, i liked what i was given, & would even buy a sequel if there is one.So if ur not sure about VN's, try this with an open mind & u might b as surprised as i was."

It's enjoyable, but buy it on sale.Shan Gui Is a pretty simple visual novel with a nice story. I can't talk too much about it without spoiling anything, but it basically follows the story of a young college student who is visiting a rural part of China to remember some memories she made with her family there. There wasn't anything too unexpected in the story, but it had a nice message of remembering to enjoy the little things in life.The art is decent and they did record voiceovers for the two main characters. Gameplay-wise, well, there's none. There is literally no interaction with this game whatsoever other than clicking the mouse to advance the text, there aren't even any choices to make like in most games in this genre. You are just there to enjoy the story and that's it, though they did include a gallery option if you really want to look at certain art again.While I did enjoy the story itself, it's quite short. I finished the whole game in 60 minutes, and with the lack of choices for replay value, there's really not much of a reason to play this more than once."
,Not Recommended,307050,14497962,"Posted: 16 February, 2015",all,AssassinGlasgow,"This game is a mixed bag for me. I absolutely adore the background visuals and the soundtrack, as well as some of the art, but the story itself just was not doing it for me. That isn't to say the story isn't a bad story, just that the execution itself was not as great.As I said, the art is fantastic. The backgrounds are easily the best part. The actual character art is good, however there are times where it is inconsistent, and other times where there were huge problems with proportion or anatomy. There are also stylistic quirks that may bother some (the ways the eyes are shaped); for example, I'm absolutely bothered by how the clothing just sticks to the character's bodies. What seems like a normal shirt looks like vaccumed latex suits to emphasize her breasts, and it just does not fit with her clothes. This only further adds to the strange sexualization of the characters and writing at times, and takes away from the simple and beautiful serenity the story is trying to go for. The character designs, however, were great, and the colouring really made up for some of the linework's flaws.The story is pretty simple: Our main character Han Hui returns to a place in her childhood hoping for nostalgia and memories. The core of the story itself is to experience peace and go along with Han Hui's walk, and I think it was able to make things beautiful. However, it fails at execution and explanation for motivations, so in the end the characters and their relationships to each other felt weak. The biggest thing I wanted to know was Hui's motivation for wanting to go back, of wanting to keep those days from every disappearing. There is a brief explanation near the end of why, but I felt like it did little to impact me so when the reveal happened I wasn't affected by it. I think it would have been better if we had shown an interaction that demonstrated her explanation (show, not tell, if you will), but there was none to be found there. I also felt that this affected the friendship between her and He Jia itself, though to a lesser extent due to He Jia's longer screen time, I also don't quite understand how the characters reacted at the end, and to avoid spoilers let's just say it didn't seem very believable.The music itself I have no complaints with. It was very fitting and pretty serene, and honestly my favorite part about this VN. The voice acting is nothing to write home about, and while I liked the addition of it, Han Hui's VA was monotone and the sound quality for her mic was not as good as He Jia's. There were times where voice sounds cut out (though maybe it was intentional?) and there were grammar errors or strange word choices the popped up occaisionally. The links they gave to fill you in on the background information of the game were a welcome addition to learning about the area.I really wanted to like this game, and while I did like some of it, other parts I just couldn't. I recommend if you do plan on getting it to get it on sale (as of writing this it's 66% off) but don't expect too much from it."

Shan Gui is the story of Han Hui, a young woman on a break from college, who goes to revisit the location of some of her childhood memories. While there she meets He Jia, a young girl who offers to be her guide. Together they travel through the mountains, appreciating history and nature, as well as each others' company. Through their travels He Jia helps Han Hui come to terms with some of the new difficulties of adult life, and some of the unpleasant memories of childhood.The story is well written, with only a few translation errors still remaining from the original Chinese. The voice acting is decent, though it sounds like it was done with low-quality materials. This doesn't detract from the feeling of authenticity of these characters. The music is tranquil and fits the mood of the story well.The art, especially the background design, is quite striking. You're going to remember some of the scenes after your play-through.The game is quite short; you can finish it in 1-2 hours, and there are no choices, so there's no real need to play it again. Still, as a story it's definitely got some good feeling to it, and it's quite cheap. If you're interested in some lighter VN fare, then you'll probably like this one, and there's really no excuse not to buy it if it's on sale.-----------------UPDATE: In May 2016 Shan Gui left Steam for a short period due to legal disputes between the developer, Magenta Factory, and the publisher, Ju Cai. Basically Ju Cai went back on the publishing agreement and didn't pay Magenta Factory any revenuefor over a year. When Magenta Factory tried to stop this, they were shut out of the Steamworks group and were forced to have Steam take the game down. Ju Cai sued them and forced the game to go back up. As of now I don't know if Magenta Factory is profiting from this game.This does not change my recoomendation of the game itself, which I still say is a good game and worth playing. I do, however, condemn Ju Cai and will not buy from them again, while I will still follow Magenta Factory. I will not discourage people from buying Shan Gui, but I will encourage people to follow Magenta Factory only when it comes to any new games. This kind of behavior should not be tolerated on Steam."

This is definately not the genre for me.  I need to speed through Hotline Miami just to jatter my mind straight again.  Erm.. unbiased review away!Just to set it straight, this is not a porno adult erogame.  Probably not, unless there's a very very specific market for this softcore thing, if it can even be called that.  I'm the last person to ask.  The fastest way to beat the game is to click as fast as you possibly can...Sorry, I really don't have experience with VNs.  I think I was supposed to feel sad and connected with the characters.  I nearly feel asleep as I was sloped at an angle my chair was never meant to hold a human being in.  I remember you ""take control"" or ""play as"" (seriously this genre) a college girl going on a walk because of bad memories or something, then you pass out.  Then a girl appears who is totally not a mysterious fox being and then whatever sadness and stuff and you're supposed to cry and then the game ends.For you pervos out there looking for a throbbing time, you'll be left disappointed.  For you fanatic VN fans, I hear this one is comparitively short.  If you're like me and you need instant gratification in your video games, stay away.I'll mark this as ""recommened"" for at least being a high quality game with the music and Chinese voices, and some unlockables.

I see people complaining about boring lazy voice acting but again- this story is so chill there is no need for anything dynamic. It's similar to the VN ""Narcissu"" in this sense, less is definitely more.The only things I can fault with this VN is down to my own pickiness. The main character certainly didn't require such huge bazongas and the whole ending scene seemed a little forced and out of place, but maybe that's just me.In the end- though it is a low price, unless you particularly like this kind of thing, or (like me) you are jumping through every hoop for easy achievements that you can get- I'd wait until this is on some sort of sale to buy it.

It's all about your inner feels and emotions. Have you ever felt, that you don't care about people, you are ought to love? Have you ever felt left behind in a labyrinth of your inner fears? This VN is all about it. It also had some pretty sensational moments, which I won't, of course, spoil, but know, that you have some things and twists to look forward to.CharactersA student with a bit of a messed up life and warm childhood memories meets a strange understanding, enthusiastic, but unic in her own way girl. There's not much to say, just that MC were pretty well made for a story that short.MusicPretty enchanting and relaxing tunes on the background and some nice voice acting. I don't particulaly like Chinese, but I can't ask for too much, can I?..GraphicsThe scenes (especially sceneries) were amazingly well drawn and felt real. The character designs were kinda mediocre, but cute at the same time.Overall, I can't say I regret buying it. At least, I know it exists now, and I can recommend it to someone.

Given the fairy-tale setting the characters were believable enough and each rather sweet in their own way. The cast was limited but that felt fitting and the new voice acting was a huge improvement over the old. The fan service moments were amusing and done in good taste, even if I well that main character’s breasts were over accentuated in just about all the art she appeared in. If a player is ready to sit down and experience a story instead of interacting with the novel, then they’re in for a treat. That said, the lack of player interaction leads to two main problems. First is that there’s absolutely no replay value whatsoever unless you want to hear the exact same story and character interactions again. Second is that since the game is pixel for pixel the same experience for every playeryou could just look up someone else playing the whole game on YouTube instead of buying the game, which would save you the money and still give you virtually the same experience. The only reason to buy it is for the “vanity” of having it and its play time in your library and also getting the achievements and trading card drops if that’s your thing.

There are no choices or multiple endings, it is just a casual read-through. The two main characters of this novel are fully voiced in chinese, and the text is available in English, Japanese, Russian and French.With the story set in the mountains in China, this novel takes you on a 1-day trip with the protagonist and what she experiences. This novel greatly describes the scenery and atmosphere of the locations the protagonist visits with nice illustrations. Sometimes with wikipedia hyperlinks some Chinese names are explained, so there is no worry there is something you won't understand. It also nicely conveys the feelings of the protagonist as she reminisces about her past.I think its a matter of taste, but I personally liked the illustrations and the character design a lot. They look really bautiful and you clearly see that there was much work done into them. Another thing which really fascinated me is the BGM. it fits to the content really well and creates a calming and relaxing atmosphere.I guess the only thing which bothered me was that it was over so fast. I really liked how relaxing it was and it made me wanna go to China and see the beautiful scenery myself.I definitely recommend this short novel to people who enjoy this genre, and who just want to sit back and relax, because this game really sets your mind on ease. I got this game on sale, but after playing it I can say it is worth the full price for sure, even though it is short.UPDATE 2016/06/25: I won't change anything about the content in this review, but please DON'T BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM.

Now that I've played it, I can definitely say I'm glad  it was, because honestly, it rather felt like a cute little project done by a bored hobby artist that is distributed by them on their Facebook/Blog/Website for free rather than a commercial one sold on Steam.The story is supershort and predictable, the characters have a cute interaction but are honestly scary to look at (keyword: Jia). Admittedly, this might be subject to the art style, but let's face it - A pre-pubescent, tiny 9 years old with pointy boobs? That's not part of an art style, it's a choice and just sexualization. Give Han Hui boobs as monstrous as you like, she's an adult. But... just not the kid.The overall game design actually had a pretty aesthetic to it, since it's not too common to see Chinese games on Steam (not to mention Chinese Voice Acting) and I think it's nice they set their story into real locations, including in-game Wikipedia links to look the latter up. But alas, this all does not make up for how unspectacular the story is. Plus, whereas Han Hui's Voice Acting is fine, Jia's Voice Actor seriously needs to consider getting a new microphone. The recording quality is...notbefitting a commercial game, and even the decent acting job doesn't cover it up.I enjoyed it out of curiosity for a Chinese Visual Novel, but that's it. While it would have been beautiful as a simple, non-commercial indie plaything (heck, if one of my friends made this, I would even cherish it), it is not as a game on Steam.I can imagine tipping the creators a little, but nevertheless I can only recommend Shan Gui when it's on sale and really only a few cents."

There's also wikipedia links in the story so you can research the places being mentioned, which is a nice tough for those interested in having a better understanding of the secondary setting that occurs and serves little purpose to the narrative at hand.

It has a distinctly ""amateur"" feel, but also has a negligible enough price tag to make it worth reading through.A ""Kinetic Novel"", it has no choices or gameplay elements, so those that hate such things, move along.  Shan Gui is basically just an illustrated and voiced story about a girl meeting another girl and having a pleasant conversation.  In the side, they sneak in some tour guide-like descriptions of some monuments in real-world China.  Sometimes, however, humble ambitions pay off well when they focus upon delivering their core experience. As nothing but a cute story revolving around two contrasting character types, it's something you can certainly enjoy when you feel like taking a break from the tension of a ""real game"".On the negative side, it's rather short (although it's also cheap), and the voice acting in particular deserves mention; The voice actress of He Jia (the younger-looking girl) in particular uses a low-quality microphone that gives all her lines a staticy, reverbed sound like she's on a bad telephone connection.  The character art is also somewhat sub-par and a little too skinny and angular, while the background art is quite good. (Although, as a combination of real pictures with filters to make it ""look anime"" and hand-drawn images, it can sometimes look discordant to see two different art styles depict the same structure.)  Han Hui (the main character) also seems to have a shirt that hugs her chest impossibly tight and a bra size that changes between scenes, with some art seeming to focus a little too much on it.If you're at all interested in it, I suggest getting it during one of its frequent sales - it's hard to feel cheated out of half a dollar, no matter the shortness of the story.  Selling the cards makes it free."

There are a few forgivable typographical errors here and there, but I was surprised by the quality of writing in general. It's better than I had anticipated. I've played many a game created by native English speakers with far worse English grammar/punctuation. Kudos to the translation/localization staff.The soundtrack is calming and well suited to each scene. There are a few points where it cuts out entirely, in an attempt at dramatics, only to start back up again shortly thereafter, and honestly it feels more jarring than anything. That's pretty minor though, only happens a handful of times in the story and is never too detrimental.Artwork is fantastic, very serene choice of imagery that really lends credibility to the setting, and helps make the locations visited feel well realized.Give this visual novel a shot.

Though it's so short that, ironically, you actually have to leave the game open  if you want to get cards to drop, which is bothersome for someone like me who likes to craft badges. Though it's funny, theres an achievement for hitting ""start game"" that basically says ""Congrats, you didn't buy it just to idle!"".Either way, story is sweet, and a little sad at one point, so the fact that it just doesn't focus on one emotional response is enough to qualify it as good. Music is soothing, though repetative (and doesn't always loop correctly). But the game's strongest point is the background images. They are actually really beutiful, as I actually sat there looking at them for a while. You'll also learn a bit about Chinese folklore and history, and the game even provides links to wikipedia pages in-game that open up in your browser (not steams, which is a plus) for further reading, which is really cool.As far as complaints: Story is anything but deep, saw the twist from a mile away, and the low quality on He Jia's microphone is immersion breaking, and like I mentioned, it's real short.

Its not like the American anime style which doesn't quite have the same Japanese look.

,Recommended,307050,13824854,"Posted: 4 January, 2015",all,Deranged Feline,"The Graphic Novel game is not really a game per say, rather a Graphic Novel itself.Unlike most of it's genre you'd find on steam, it strickly plays out from beginning to end without making any decisive choices or playing through any mini-games to proceed. The ability to save is more like sticking a bookmark in a Manga. As a Manga, I'd label it as a slice of life story. It's not built to hold an awe inspiring epic tale or journey, nor to aim for some phylosical meaning of life. Instead, the story focuses on a day inwhich a freshman university student comes accross a young girl around the age of 12. There's some strong symbolism made between the 12-year-old girl and a fox, and it's hard to say if the author intended the symbolism to be some foreshadowing of something supernatural or merely to address her character as someone elusive and free spirited. Either way, I appreciate a more innocent take on a fox girl than Kanokon had to offer. I found that the story did a good job at capturing the image of a female college student who has wondered off to without any motive in mind, and comes accross a young girl who flatters her by addressing her as a sister. Clearly the girl looks up to Han Hui (the college student), and wishes to lighten her day.This is were I address a bit of an annoyance, the wikapedia links. The graphic novel allows some room to learn about chinese culture, and for some references that wouldn't be universal knowledge, the virtual book provides some links for Background information. If you internet's not cooperating at the time, then you're really not must at luck. I'm sure that this is something they intend to fix in time or someone might create a mod to resolve. Regardless of that inconvience, the art of story telling does a good job at addressing that where He Jia (the young girl) took Han Hui is a sight of some historical importance that man within the area have visited as kids.I would say If anything, I had a love for the artwork as well as the peaceful classical styled music in the background. As for the voice acting, I would not recommend trying to learn or pick-up much chinese from this game, unless you're already trying for an advance level of language comprehension. It's understandable for the voice to be for the most time soft-spoken. My one issue with the artwork is about the same as the artwork for Sekirei, for whatever reason, Han Hui's nipple is somehow so distinguishable that it distorts the outline of her shirt. I do not care how big a women's nipple might be, and I scarely believe any woman's article of clothing would be that revealing or tight. I also have it on good autority that women often wear bras to cover that sort of thing. In the big scale of things, it's really not that much of a problem, and it seems to only be Han Hui design with that artistic detail. Perhaps it was from the dew or I never paid that much attention to modern fashion.  I also noticed that He Jia is also drawn a bit more mature than the age she's meant to be, My guess would be somewhere around 15.The common complaint has often been that it was too short, and I felt almost like it was ended too early as well. Looking back at the price, I find considering what I often paided for each Manga that would hold about 4 chapters with no significant hold on an overall plot cost around 8-10 dollars. Too, looking at how much a DVD contain about as much as this novel, the price is quite high. So in the big scheme of things, the game's still worth the price, and plays out like a subbed anime where I don't have to put my speed reading skills to the test. The developers of the game also stated that a sequel may be on it's way, it might take a year, but it shows that there would be more to come.Overall: 6.5/10"

Another thing I noticed and I believe that it has to do with the translations, was that some of the dialog was oddly phrased, I quickly got used to simply reading it and ordering it in a way that made sense to me.All in all I  would recommend this game if you can find it on sale, the music and the art are worth it."

Kinetic meaning linear story and if there are choices they will have little to no effect on the final outcome.  The story as a whole is rather sweet and whimsical, the  music is well done and fits the journey, and the background art can be breathtaking at times.  The character / sprite art on the other hand, while well done, isn't really to my taste though it doesn't detract from the experience as a whole.If there are any downsides to the game they would have to be the quality of the limited voice acting and the English translation.  Personally I didn't find either of them to be a big issue, but for the sake of full disclosure it should be mentioned.  The translation itself does the job it needs to, I don't feel at any point something important was lost as a result, but the wording used can be very awkward at times.  As for the voice acting, the actors didn't do a bad job, the sound quality just seemed rather poor, which is strange considering the quality of the music.  Once again, not a big issue for me though.I honestly think one of the more interesting things this visual novel does is at times you will have highlighted items in the text box.  Clicking on these items will open up your web browser and take you to a Wikipedia page to give you more information about the real life locations, myths, and history touched on in the game.

It was a beautiful tale that is definitely worth buying, but I'd only recommend doing so on a steam sale. Spending $5 is a little bit too much in my opinion. I mean, if you spent $5 on every 45 minutes of a game you play, you'd only get 6.5 hours worth of gameplay for $50.The way the artist created the backgrounds was simply beautiful. The backgrounds alone make this game worthwhile. 9/10The character depth wasn't all that great, in my opinion. This could have developed into a much deeper story if the time was given to extend character exchanges and bring in my memories, thoughts, and actions by the characters. In the end, they will be easily forgotten. 4/10The music, like the background art, was astonishing. It was crisp, simple, and emotional. 8.5/10Having played a fair share of visual novels and having seen more than 400 anime, I can say that the story, overall, was not that great.  5/10I'd recommend it, yes, but only as a sale item.  6/10, overall."

This visual novel has no choice options, so it would be best if you just spend an hour and half , using auto proceed to watch the whole story. I guarantee you will feel good at the end.What I really appreciate more is the support from the developer. I had some issues with the resolution, one of the developers quickly responded to my discussion post and chat with me over an hour trying to solve the issue. Although in the end the issue seems to be related specifically to my computer setting and we weren't able to resolve it, I really appreciate the support the developer provided. Regardless of how much other people might like this visual novel, I think the attitude the developer has towards us the gamers is something that makes this visual novel even more awesome.This visual novel has given some really great experience.P.S. Just to clarify what I mentioned about the issues. I'm running dual graphics with Nvidia and integrated cards. I had issue with getting the game to be set to the correct resolution.

I liked hearing the Chinese and it was nice getting links to the various places, people, and such in the visual novel itself. The music is relaxing. It's a quiet little game that I think is good for when you need to relax. I also enjoyed the descriptions of the scents and what Han Hui experienced. I thin kthe only real negative would be the way Han Hui is drawn; her breasts are a bit...oddly drawn to say the least. Clearly some fanservice there.

The story is not particularly interesting and the text is full of errors.These glaring issues really hurt the overall package and based on that I would not recommend this game to anyone.That being said this game has some value, but it's all in it's Steam content, not the game itself:- The Steam backgrounds are gorgeous, the emotes are nice if you want some manga style emotes.- Also includes 8 achievements which you are guaranteed to get by going through the story. Easy 100%Go check out the backgrounds and emotes on the Steam market if you're into the art style, and just buy those instead of the full game.In case you're looking for cheap games to add to your 100% achievement list, consider picking this up just for that."

At times, it seems plain bad, and sometimes even a bit good. In the end, it all falls short.It feels like you are taking a tour through Wikipedia, and the whole story becomes overshadowed by the imprecise writing that can't focus on feelings, or the scenery. The characters will talk about all kinds of feelings, but you just can't relate at all. Not because there was not enough time, simply because it feels short, sudden and out of place.Sound:At the start you can actually hear something. From the middle onwards, the whole background goes almost silent, or doesn't even stand out at all. You walk through many places, but it feels like you are deaf most of the time.The voice actresses are not bad at all, however the amateur recording is enough to set your mind off the story to wonder if it is better muted or not. In this case, muted is better.Music:A bit of effort went here, but not enough. The soundtrack is simple, but not capable of feeling.Songs repeat too often, and they just blend in (in a bad way) or loop strangely. It's not enough to make you mute the game, but it could be a lot better.Graphics:For a Visual Novel, the visual part was done well. Backgrounds are amazing, character sprites are nice (the eyes are a bit off, though) and there are plenty of great CGs.The backgrounds and CGs are inconsistent between art styles, but this is a minor issue. Unfortunately it takes more than nice graphics to make a good Visual Novel.Wrapping it up:Shan Gui is short, unfunny and can even manage to feel like it's being dragged off. Its half to one hour of reading are enough to make you think about just holding the skip button until you unlock all achievements.The art is nice and feels good, but the visual novel falls short in every other category. The amauterish voice recording overshadows the potential of the voice actresses. The sound feels like it's not there at all. The story jumps through locations, feelings, monologues and convenient settings too fast, not giving you enough time to understand or relate with it.The highest reward for playing Shan Gui is to enjoy a nice couple of CGs, and even a little fanservice. However it takes more than that to save a Visual Novel. $5 feels a bit too much for it, but it's definitely a title worth of checking out if bundled. For a dollar, why not?Shan Gui gives the reader a subtle tip: you are better off enjoying your real life local scenery. Or maybe buying a Osmanthus crop is a better deal.Scores:CategoryScoreStory5/10Sound4/10Music6/10Graphics8/10Overall6/10"

,Recommended,307050,15912646,"Posted: 20 May, 2015",all,Sokami the Celtic Communist ☭,"Somewhat of a spoiler (but nothing specific):A sweet and short Visual Novel game that I would recommend to those that are pretty familiar with them. The game is basically where the main heroine (Han Gui) is attempting to find a special location from her past, when she then meets a mysterious younger girl (He jai) who is a local to the area. He Jai quickly becomes attached to Han Gui and decides to attempt to find the place He Jai spent picnics with her family at. Both of them take a long walk, Frequently getting lost in the process, but during these moments they also bond further in the process. Eventually you learn more about the main heroines background and her motives for looking for this location. There are also other special reveals you begin to learn towards the end which helps tie in the story very well. I do feel like the game probably could have gone on longer thus allowing for more development between the characters, but it ended at a point where things were tied together.The art Is very scenic displaying lush forest, lakes, vegetation. The character art is well done, and the main characters themselves seem to grow significantly with in game developments. The background music is very good and fits the scenery. As with any visual novel, it features an 'extras' page containing all the in-game plot moments, background pictures and music you encounter during the game.Over all it is a light-hearted game with some moments of melancholy and later on moments of interesting reveals and a few interesting twist. The game is ultimately about Han hui exploring herself through the memories of her past and locations she once visited as a young girl, while forming a bond between her and the eccentric but cute He Jai as they visit various locations. I recommend this game to veterans, and new comers alike that don't mind a non-romance visual novel about self-exploration and bonding."

But as a game itself, I cannot reccomend it.If you're an achivement lover though (Which is part of the reason I got it) then you'll like it.

The story is a bit on the tame side, being just about a young woman trying to reconnect with a memory from her childhood with the aid of an excitable young girl she meets who has something strange about her, but it still packs a fair bit of emotion. The story really is a bit too simple (there's no conflict of any kind and the ""twist"" is predictable as all get out), but the soothing presentation invests you in the characters. In either case, it's short, cheap and you're better off having played it than not (unlike SOME games I could mention *coughSakuraSpiritcough* where you feel like you just burned an hour off your life that you'll never be able to get back) so it gets a thumbs up.
