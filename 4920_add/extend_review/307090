,Recommended,307090,12572828,"Posted: 19 October, 2014",all,TIME FOR DEATH,"To be succinct, this is the FPS dungeon crawler that I've always wanted.Fancy Skulls is stylish, atmospheric and an overall enjoyable experience. Combat is slick, the exploration is straight-forward—not as much backtracking a la Heavy Bullets, which for all intents are purposes, is also good shooter— and the enemies are just too damn cool for their own good.The rooms are randomly generated, with unique adversaries whom can be summoned at the player's will, introducing an element of strategy to your spelunking, and good performance is rewarded, which is good because the game gets challenging in the last half, though an end game boss is conspicuously absent.My only complaint is that the game could use more variety of rooms. Maybe some different layouts that can be generated on each level, or even a randomized layout for each room? More challenge rooms would be great in the final version, as well. Maybe a boss? Regardless, the different weapon upgrades and abilities are just enough to keep the game fresh and entertaining.Fancy Skulls is well worth the price of admission. I cannot wait for the completed version."

I really want to like this game, but there are so many things that make it not too fun,oh, and there's a lot of little things about this game that irritate me about it, namely...-skillshotting seems heavily emphasized for rewards, so much that it seems to make the revolver the best weapon in the game.-the level generator seems to have very little resources to work with, either that or some generation aspects are limited until you get to higher floors.-projectiles don't get removed when you clear a room, that crap's ridiculous.-too many of the items feel useless compared to others.-health is incredibly small (four hits and you die) compared the amount of enemies with both fast shots and loads of projectiles."

If you enjoy roguelike games, this should be on your list to buy, but at the moment, only buy it if you have a coupon or it's on sale. The reason I say that is because there is not much gameplay available yet (still in early access). Once the game gets a couple big updates, I could definitely give it a 100% seal of approval."

The guns are pretty gimmicky and useless, specially as you progress and upgrades the superior main gun. The enemies aren't ""fancy"", they're just badly modeled shapes.There's actually very little content in the game. Being ""minimalistic"" doesn't justify being so short, and it also ends abruptly, with no climax or conclusion whatsoever, a simple ""game over"" screen that returns you to the main menu.Other than that it was pretty fun for about an hour or so.

Each enemy is unique it its appearance and attack styles so you can learn from each and adapt to beat it. Watch out for challenge levels, for if you fail the challenge, you will die instantly without warning. The price tag is a bit high, but for a greenlit game, it's forgivable.

,Recommended,307090,11018447,"Posted: 2 July, 2014",all,Facewizard,"Fancy Skulls is a minimalistic FPS-roguelike with stylish art and an extremely fast, easy-to-pick-up feel.Over the past year, a large number of FPS-rogulikes have been released, including Tower of Guns, Heavy Bullets, Eldritch, and now Fancy Skulls. Of these, Fancy Skulls is probably the easiest to pick up and play repeatedly in short bursts. Levels are small, movement and firing speed is extremely fast, each room has a very small number of enemies, and the various upgrade systems are lightweight and easy to manage. The number of projectiles on-screen at any time is much smaller than Tower of Guns, for example. Fans of fast-paced-but-precise FPS games will find Fancy Skulls extremely rewarding.Fancy Skulls' most interesting mechanics are those surrounding the ""eggs"" system. In each room, enemies begin by sitting inert inside large black eggs. Stepping on a plate in the center of the room hatches them and locks the doors, flinging the player into a tiny, high-stakes arena fight. A variety of gameplay mechanics and upgrades hook into the eggs system. The moment when the eggs all ""hatch"" remains exciting and compelling even after several hours of play.If you're looking for something with a uniquely fresh artstyle and fun, original FPS mechanics, Fancy Skulls is a good choice."

,Recommended,307090,15840183,"Posted: 15 May, 2015",all,W.A. the Anum,"From the grafic/art of this game, you can compare it with ""Heavy Bullets"".Its pretty simply ""3D"" poli-grafic and each time you play it is random - like Heavy Bullets.But i like it a bit more than Heavy Bullets coz it doesnt have this ""suddendly"" moments. Each room you enter you can see already the enemy(s) spawn points as ""black eggs"" so you know if you go into the middle of the room (so thats the point that those enemys will....""hatch"") you know exactly how many enemys it will be (mostly around 4 in each room).The ProsI love the art of this game and the grafic fits pretty much. It plays pretty good and the enemys are really unique. The weapons are more or less ""well known"" like a shotgun, flamethrower or a cannon. You also can nicely mod them if you find one of those or buy ones from the stores in the game. The difficult is also nice, not to hard, i would even say still a bit ""to easy"".The CosSadly after you know ""how unique"" the enemys are they are pretty easy to deal with and you can see already how many enemys will spawn if you go into the middle of the room. Also, as i said, the weapons are ""well known"" means sadly also it is nothing new. Next to this feels the beginning weapons, the revolver pretty much like a ol´classic 48-revolver out of the west. Ok, to be fair, you can mod it but at the beginning, its slow....and it IS slow as f*ck. Also the difficult doesnt get pretty much higher. Ones you have a good run (like i did with a full over mod revolver) you can finish every enemy with one shot and just shoot them in the face - i did it in one hour.The FactFS is a nice first person shooter but it misses a bit of content. The main idea is nice but you maybe should add things like different characters which starts with different beginner weapons, a bit like ""Binding of Isaac"" maybe. Also you maybe should ""rise"" the difficult a bit, JUST a bit, coz it is really waaaaay to easy. Next to this should maybe enemys drop more health.I like it still but i must be THAT honest that i got the game in early access, so things can still change and i HOPE they do. Just add and change some things here and there and i bet FS will be even more funny as it is already.I give it 7 points out of 10 so far."

,Recommended,307090,12321985,"Posted: 1 October, 2014",all,K!netic,"Feels like a senior project. It's fun, to-the-point, and uses simple (but still somehow creative) art. There's surprisingly little sound or music, and the  environments are bland. I can understand why, the collisions seem strange (near-90-degree ramps can be walked up with little effort), so it probably didn't lend itself to more complex environments. It has a flat color palette, and everything feels like a triangle.Anyway, the gameplay is solid. The weapons are fun, the mods give a surprisingly wide array of ways to play, and the enemies keep you on your toes. While I only died once before winning, and caught most of the achievements on that run, I don't have too much animosity towards this game. At least it has an *ending*, so many ""permadeath"" games try to squeeze pointless hours out of you without giving you a reason to keep playing.If you enjoyed Heavy Bullets, you'll probably appreciate this game."

,Not Recommended,307090,30811611,Posted: 29 March,all,Insomniac Leopard,"It saddens me to say that with only 1.7 hours playing this game I feel like I've seen all this game has to offer.While it has some interesting ideas such as weapon mods that change up how you play with the same basic weaponry, it seems to fall short in a lot of other areas, for example the level design feels very vertical yet you only have one jump at the beginning of the game and can rarely find extra jump items or a flying augment that allows you to jump further in the air and more often etc, but that is only if you are lucky, this sometimes becomes frustrating because you have to rely on running around rooms a lot instead of over objects unless you have those items, furthermore the procedural generation often causes chests and boxes to be out of reach unless you have those jump items, the game should not be penalizing you for its own RNG especially when it is rare to find decent loot in chests/boxes as it is. The weapons all have their own feel to them but yet again are shells of weapons you've seen in other games, nothing really special about them except when you recieve weapon mods from shops which stack together unless they conflict. The art style is decent in an abstract or absurdest kind of way, however i've noticed some enemies look very similar which ends up being both confusing and uninteresting, the more varried designs show up around the end of the game but they are shortlived because the game is very short, there are currently 9 levels and thats all, even taking my time i beat the game in just a few runs and with only 1.7hrs on record. The levels are very barren in terms of design, for me the walls had no texturing, I am not sure if that is a problem on my side but I have changed around graphical settings and nothing really changes. Also, certain enemies seem to make these horrible white noise sounds that end up giving you a headache after playing too long, this happened to me the first time I played it and I had to stop after just 30 minutes of attempting to work out how the game plays. I am very glad I got this on sale which is the only way I would recommend it because it definately shows promise, some people are saying the dev ditched this but if they did not I hope they take criticism into account because this game is one of many rougelike shooters out there now, there are plenty of other titles that do what this does and adds onto it because this feels like it is just missing elements to it. If it had maybe a few mechanics to it I would like it a lot more but as it stands I feel like there is not much more to see in it. And it is a shame because I wanted to like this from seeing the art style and the name and the description, but for now I just tolerate it. I will not be refunding it because I want to follow this and hopefully it will grow into a game I would gladly spend more time playing.TLDR; I feel like this game is missing gameplay elements to make it worth full price (or more as it says in the early access page it will increase in price when fully released) but it is decent if you can get it on sale, just dont hold your hopes too high unless the dev updates it more."

Sure TOWER OF GUNS HEAVY BULLETS and ZIGGURAT all great FPS-roguelikes, but they forget that you can do much more with the roguelike genre. They are missing out on: secrets, a variety of items that give you buffs, a wide range of enemies and simple but intriguing combat.To sum it all up: FANCY SKULLS doesn't try to be a randomly generated DOOM, it tries more to be a FPS- Isaac/SPELUNKY type of game.And that ladies and gentleman is why I love this game so much!
