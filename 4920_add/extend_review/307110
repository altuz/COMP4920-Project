,Recommended,307110,29931941,Posted: 14 February,all,Bread Scientist,"This game is very promising for an Early Access game. The devs clearly waited for the game to be in an ACTUAL playable state, and with friends with this a BLAST. I am ususally busy (I am currently clinically depressed, so I'm either at school or asleep) but when I have time THIS is the game I've been playing the most. After finishing the final boss I have to say this game takes some practice but it is not Don't Starve levels of difficulty. I'd say it can be a casual game, but don't expect to get very far on your first run. A few problems (mainly with networking and server issues) and some placeholders (for bosses, mainly, but they still work very well as bosses. They're all larger and deadlier regular enemies execpt for one, and one of them is too cool for me to really even say it's just a regular enemy.) All of the 4 jobs on the ship are fun, but some seem more appealing at first, be prepared for bickering over who gets to be gunner and pilot.or maybe my friends are all just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s."

It's a fantastic time to sit down with friends and knock out a few levels, the devs are on top of things with frequent updates, and while character models may need some work with texture overlap, I love the art style.Bottom line, I love this game and you should buy it, it has a lot of potential."
,Not Recommended,307110,32729633,Posted: 24 June,all,Krypt0N,"We Need to Go Deeper is a great game but the problem with this game is the repetitiveness. Although I have only played about 2 hours I could feel that there’s nothing else to do in this game. I do understand it is in early access but I was quite disappointed with it. I felt as if there was no clear objective to this game and at one point it’s just going to be boring. I would recommend it to people who love a game where there’s nothing to do. Another factor that made me dislike the game was the fact that you could not pick two items while spawning like the sword and the wrench but because it’s in early access it can be forgiven.Fortunately, I did not face the network issue which the others were talking about. Overall it was a great co-op experience with my friends but that great experience lasted for about 50 minutes. I would not recommend this game in its current situation."
,Recommended,307110,31422759,Posted: 28 April,all,Pro Surgeon,"INTRODUCTIONOne of my favorite games so far! If you like games with exploration, co-op, surviving enemies, and boss battles, then this game is for you! The driving can be hard at first to get youst to, but you eventually get the hang of it.CAVESMy favorite part of the game is cave delving. This is where you go into a cave, kill enemies such as: crabs, clams, skeletonspirate sea, dead fishpirate sea, and so much more! Along the way in the cave, there will be weapons, gold, and 1 upgrade for your submarine.BUGSKeep in mind this game is still inEARLY ACCESS, so bugs are bound to happen. Here are some of the bugs I've ran into:When you enter the cave as soon as someone gets on the wheel, your camera will be stuck in the sub, and you'll be stuck in the caveIf you're going down, and your driver spams a and d, it'll flip the submarine.Sometimes if you become fast, or slow, it'll  be stuck there for the rest of the game, until something changes it.ITEMSThis game has A LOT of items, mostly cosmetics, but it still has a lot. They can range from healing, to damage, or to helping the sub! Some of these include:Pump - This will pump out water in your sub, to help your teammates not drown.Rivet Gun - This will allow you to repair holes one by one. You have one shot before reloading, and it half fixes a hole.WARNING: DO NOT POINT AT FACEMusket - Just like old fashioned muskets, but reloads WAY quicker.Wrench - This will allow you to fix a hole. It's different from the rivet gun though... If 2 holes are next to each other, you can repair both with one swing, versus with the rivet gun, you can only repair one hole at a time.Medkit - Pretty self explainatory. The only thing that makes it different is that you can only heal teammates.Chemistry Kit -THIS ONE WILL BE VERY LONG ALSO ALL OF THESE ACCOUNT FOR YOU YOUR TEAMMATES AND ENEMIESThis item is a jack of all trades. It can heal with the red one, hurt with orange, cure diseases with the purple, increase speed with the yellow, and slow things down with blue.CONTROLSA - Move left, and turn the sub to the left.D - Move right, and turn the sub to the right.W - Jump, go deeper with the sub, make the turret move left, and put in power.S - Crouch, go up with the sub, make the turret move right, revive, and take out power.LMB - Fire your gun, and use your melee.RMB - Switch weapons.E - Interact with everything.Space - Fire a torpedo.CONCLUSIONOverall, this is an amazing game. It's a lot of fun, and has quite a lot of features, with new ones to come. This game is a lot of fun overall, please consider buying it. Thank you for taking the time to read my review, have a nice day, and goodbye.EDITThank you all so much for giving positive feedback on this review! This is my first actual review that isn't when I'm just making a joke review. I hope this review helped you make your decision."

,Recommended,307110,32033729,Posted: 28 May,all,CloudSauce,"I thoroughly enjoy this game.Although it currently has quite a few bugs (which is expected for an early release), the core mechanics and the premise itself are so well thought out that it's impossible to not fall in love. The game is still in its infancy it's true, but it has a ton of potential. Teamwork elements are well defined, the art-style is charming, the animations are silly but fun, and the music sets the atmosphere quite well.10/10 would get simultaneously humped by four turtles again."
76561198093230364,Recommended,307110,29795190,Posted: 8 February,all,Ketrai,"PROS- 2-4 Players. Although some would say that the lack of a solo mods is bad, I wouldn't see it that way. You are forced to cooperate with someone. If you don't have a friend at hand, that means randoms, and can lead to interesting situations! It's a lot of fun to start talking on discord, and learn to cooperate as a team with a few random players. We got very far with just two people!- Procedurely generated. Whilst almost mandatory for a game like this, I think it's well done the way it is. The map can even hide valuable caves for you, and can force you to explore other ends of the map, instead of just going deeper.- Diversified threats. You rarely die in the same way, and the devs keep on adding. Of course you learn all about these different biomes, but for now it's quite refreshing.- A goofy, yet scary artstyle. You're like hey, these fishes don't look so scary, that one even looks cute! But when you go deeper, that is where the scary creatures come along o.o, I hadn't expected fish could even look scary with an artstyle like this, good job devs!- A dedicated dev team. Lots of response to the forums, and generally they work hard on improvements. I remember that after an update a few areas became a lot more challanging!- Customization is always fun.Cons- Some networking issues, a priority of the devs, will get fixed soon!- Potentially repetetive. Although this depends on the kind of gamer you are, you may find it repetive, especially if your crew never mixes up roles. This often happens in a crew of 3-4, try playing with just 2 for more challenge, diversity! It's a lot more intense!- Kit system. Rather underwhelming in its current state, you only ever want a wrench or a sword for starters, if you take almost anything else, you'll lack the ability to repair properly, or fight properly, which causes many issues.- There is no cuttlefish in the game.- Some bugs, but nothing major.REMEMBER: This game is early acces, a lot of the stuff will get updated, but for it's current state I would say it is very strong already!"

You may notice other people have connections issues, worry not as the game is still in early access. The developers are working hard to improve the game in almost every aspect with new content frequently added. They are active on the forums reading our suggestions, along with the community they are also there to help with any problems. This game is worth its price in entertainment, especially if you have friends. I'd say the risk is well worth the reward. The game will only get better as time passes."

76561197974217596,Recommended,307110,29799496,Posted: 9 February,all,Clockwork Monkey,"The concept of the game is great, the art style is too. There's a real sense of adventure when playing with friends on comms. There are issues regarding connecting to games at the moment, but it's stable once you're in a game, or at least has been for me. Unfortunately, a lack of content at the moment, means that while the first dive is amazing, it gets rather repetitive after that. The item system feels rather basic. Item pickups with randomised stats would be a welcome addition.If they can add enough content so that every dive feels like a unique experience, it'll be fantastic.Still worth getting for those first few plays, but don't expect to put hundreds of hours into it just yet."

As it is, I already recommend the game as it is just plain fun to play with friends.

76561198027915466,Recommended,307110,29822042,Posted: 10 February,all,Murray Cook,"Already a really great game, with the potential to be incredible. The best way I can describe it is a mixture of the gameplay of Guns of Icarus and the art style of something like Don't Starve. Over the last few days/week there have been countless 'Hot Fixes' from the devs that have addressed concerns and issues players have voiced. For an Early Access title this is suprisingly rare, and warrants both attention and praise.You and up to 3 other players help crew a submarine in an expedition to go as deep as possible under the sea. Different roles like steering, fixing the hull and firing torpedoes at the underwater beasties require teamwork and cooperation, so I will admit I can see it being frustrating for people who don't have friends to play it with, but thankfully it is simple enough that I think most people won't have a problem.The game isn't the most complex game yet, involving essentially only 3 or 4 different actions to progress, but a number of placeholders (for example, there are obvious markers that indicate future additions of more submarines and further character customisation and personalisation) within lead me to believe it will be a fair bit deeper. I have thoroughly enjoyed the few hours I have played so far."

There are bugs, however the devs are seeming to solve them very quickly, which is nice to see for once in a smaller early access game.Without bringing friends, your experiance will be dampened slightly, however joining with randoms can still deliver a great experiance depending on how they play and interact with you and others.  In hindsight ai dont think I have came across a lobby with anyone i took a disliking to.Overall, We Need to go Deeper is a very  promising game and I feel that it is well worth a purchase. With the devs planing to add more content in the future It will definetly have a rather long lifetime.It would be better if they relesed the soundtrack already!"

Although you may still encounter some problems and bugs, be sure to keep the devs informed! They've been doing good work with hotfixing the product.UPDATE: Reformed the review to fit the circumstances.--Short version: We Need To Go Deeper is a co-operative game about exploration and survival. Thanks to its' simple interface and fluid mechanics it should be an interesting addition to the legion of co-op games out there. 4/5.--Long version: We Need To Go Deeper is a co-operative game about exploration and survival. Albeit the game can be played solo, it is highly recommendable to either play with friends or join random lobbies available in the game's menus. The gameplay is about controlling a submarine mutually with a crew consisting of up to 4 people, whereas 2 seems to be recommended minimum. The co-operative gameplay supports *both* Internet- and LAN-connections, which is a huge bonus to this game's value! Hosting and joining lobbies is very easy and fluid, and the text-chat within the game allows players to co-ordinate their actions if microphones and external communication software are not readily available.The control mechanics themselves feature minimal keyboard usage and a mouse, no support for a controller as much as I could see -- cardinal directions, use-button, overview of the submarine's surroundings, use of equipped item and switching the equipment. The crew need to control basic things such as engine power, steering, weapons and hull-integrity while inside the submarine. Optimally one person should be always in charge of steering while the other handles engine and gunnery control. Obviously the more people, the easier the control will be.All in all, the biggest strength of the game is its' easy-to-approach style and intention to keep the gameplay fun. We Need To Go Deeper seems like a nice co-op game with a lot of potential, possibly keeping you entertained from several to even a couple of dozen hours. 4/5."

This game is tons of fun with friends or with the right team of randoms. Constantly rewarding. I didn't think there was anything else to unlock until i got to 10k fathoms and to my suprise... A whole new selection of outfits! The devs are fantastic and very community involved. Take my word for it and don't pass on this game.To be honest im not one for jumping on a near full price game in early access. However... I just had to with this game. The beautiful graphics and the brilliant concept (not to mention non-gender specific moustaches and beards ;)) drew me in and i took a gamble with a friend. We went in and straight away were in fits of giggles:- Hillarious crouched walking animations will definately impress your friends (NEVER change this)- Wonderful ragdoll chicken leg animations when you jump leaving everyone in awe!- The community i have met so far are fun people aswell as team workers- Game developers are already fast at fixing things less than 24 hours in!- Clear path of what they want to do in the future- Constantly different adventures- Scream inducing and has you giddy like a school girl at timesCons:-I have honestly only found one con. This is a bug that causes a person to not be recognised as inside the sub so therefore renders you all unable to function any of the jobs. HOWEVER. This happened only twice and both were with the same random player so could have been something on his side i'm not sure.In short:-We took the gamble and i don't regret a penny. I think already i have a bargain on my hands as this game is already well fleshed out compared to most early access. Try it and you will be in for a great time full of laughs and toe curling moments when things suddenly go wrong!Keep up the fantastic work developers and don't stray from your path. Fantastic job.

""We Need to Go Deeper"" is a truly fun game- be it managing the helm, firing and reloading torpedos, or even just sleeping on thatcomfortablebed.

Using that gold, you shop in the catalog to buy absolutelyfabulousclothing and hats. Also, the name is not in fact an innuendo to some sort of Huniepop style game, like I thought it was- in fact, it's a different genre entirely.

The game is super fun to play with my friends and you meet great people along the way. I like how they are adding new updates a lot so the game is improving the further they get into development. There is a lot of customization for your character and you can create funny names for yourself. There are a few glitches but that is with every Early Access game. Bugs will get fixed eventually. Can be Repetitive but they are adding new things very soon! have fun playing!!! would recommend 11/10 monkey wrenches xD

It may or may not be updated depending on when you read this.Overall, for an Early Access game, We Need to Go Deeper is awesome. It is not yet very complex, but as I state below, the devs are absolutely amazing and I have no doubt they will add many more features in the future. Please don't decide to not buy the game simply based off the reviews that talk about ridiculous server trouble, as they were outdated pretty much as soon as they were written. This game has a lot of potential and a great dev team, so I think we can expect an awesome game upon full release!ShoutoutFirst off, I don't think that I have ever seen so many updates pushed out in so little time, so I would like to mention that not enough people appreciate the devs for all the hard work they have done to get the servers into the shape that they are in. For example, around 4:45 (I don't remember the exact time) on February 12th, they sent out a message saying that they were attempting to fix a relay server problem, and in about 1.5 hours they had completely erased the issue. Great job, devs!Server StabilityJust a few days ago, it was very hard to join a server without the game crashing, and to be honest the game was just about unplayable. Now, they are much more stable; I don't think my friends and I have had any troubles joining games even though a few of them have the IPv6 problem. Also, the most recent update adding private servers was a much needed fix; people joining games was really annoying without lobby chat (another awesome addition).GameplayTo me, the gameplay is great. It doesn't get boring quickly at all. I think it would benefit from more random map generation and more extensive caves, as long as health is better balanced so that the crew doesn't have to run in, defeat three or four crabs, and run back to the sub to heal. Also, once more subs are released, I think the game will be much more fun.Misc.The only other complaint I have about the game is that it can only be played multiplayer co-op, but the purchase is for one copy. I think that a $15.00 - $17.50 two copy edition would be a great addition. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this game to just about anyone!"

,Recommended,307110,29788283,Posted: 8 February,all,Green,"Review V1 (0.3 hours)I only had time to try it out for a bit this morning with another friend who bought it but it was pretty fun! I'll update the review when I've played more but for now I would definitely recommend it to everyone. Obviously it's missing some stuff since the game is in Early Access but there's more than enough content for you to keep playing for a while and not get bored immediately. It was kind of challenging with only the two of us but that also made it kind of more fun, changing the amount of people you play with is definitely another way to try out the game in different ways once you've played through it a lot and need something new.Review V2 (3.1 hours)Convinced another friend to buy it + gifted it to a 4th person and tried out some 4 player games. It's even more fun with 4 people although even with 4 it gets really difficult by the 3rd level (I've only gotten about 4900 fathoms deep). Now that I've played it some more there are some bugs/glitches I've noticed so I'm going to put it below so the devs can see it:1. My 2nd time playing it (3 people) when we entered the 2nd level/stage the game crashed for 2 people but the host stayed in the game and could play by himself.2. Both with 3 people and 4 people occasionally when someone picks up a item from the ground when they already have 2 equipped and then place it back down the others can't see it. So for example: you have sword and wrench, you grab cleaver from ground and put wrench down. Now you reequip the wrench and put the cleaver back down but the others can't see the cleaver or equp it, only you can. This only sometimes happened and other times it didn't.3. I'm not sure if this is a feature or a glitch but if you're in a cave and you shoot into the wall with a gun and there's a snail or something else down on the floor it takes a damage. This also happens at different angles where you can't be attacked but you can shoot with gun into wall.4. If the torpedoe slots are closed and you stand in front of it and spam e to place the torpedoe in, as soon as the slot opens you place the torpedoe in and then you still have a torpedoe in your hand so its like you got extra ammo in your hand without doing anything.5. If you create a game and name it something, then leave, and then make another lobby and name it the same thing it doesn't show up for anyone else. If you name it something else it works but if it's the same it doesn't. We had to restart the game 3 times before it let us use the same name.6. One of us bought the safari shirt but then it wasn't in customization and no longer in catalog, it just disappeared.However these are all minor glitches and the game is still a ton of fun, I'll update this as I play more."

I just got done talking to Ryan on steam directly and he wanted to collect as much data from me as possible to resolve problems with an Early Access Game. This let me know they are actually driven for this game to work and kick off, and I beg everyone to throw the 10 dollars and give it a try. The actual game play is challenging, and the need to communicate with your crew is also very interesting as well!We need to go Deeper reminds me of Guns of Icarus - minus the multiplayer or PvP aspect. It is a PvE game that forces a group of 4 to maintain Hull Integrity in their Late 1800s or Early 1900s submarine (that is what the art reminds me of at least.) And as the title says, You need to Go Deeper. Definitely recommend, and if you do get it Early Access please please please give the Devs as much data as you can on bugs, they REALLY WANT to fix it."

At last, a good example of an early access project that is totally playable and enjoyable. You don't feel like you're paying for promises instead of a game. The only huge problem ATM is the lack of chat in a lobby. If no one takes the wrench as the first item it will be impossible to fix the submarine and therefore you're doomed from the beginning and gonna get bodied, and you are unable to communicate on that with random people. Besides that, it is as awesome as it gets, pure indie badassery."

The coop experience is nice as everyone has different roles on the ship and you can easliy swap roles to freshen things up. And working as a team will either make you last 5 mins or 3 hours depending how far you get. Currently in early access this game shines when exploring and learning how to work as team and unlocking new items to help you reach greater depths. Hopefully developpers can add outfits with different buffs for different roles and so on as well as keeping the gameplay fresh. As an Idea I was thinking perhaps they could take inspiration from Voyage to the center of the earth and make a similar mode except you would be going further into the ground.

Combat in caves is nothing but waiting for the enemy to die from your unsatisfying attacks while occasionally running back to the sub to heal up.

,Not Recommended,307110,35071635,Posted: 19 September,all,Nanako =^.^=,"Needs a lot of workGraphics are a good place to start, they look silly. The game uses an approach of sprites stitched together to make a human. It used to be a common technique in flash games, nothing wrong with it. But here he's used too few, so arms and legs don't bend. Your character crouches by attaching their legs to their shoulders (legs which look like turkey drumsticks),  arms are always bent at a slight angle, face is permanantly locked into one stern expression (with unremovable goggles). In general its just really awkward to look at and visually disappointingControls are awkward. Interacting with anything is a game of carefully positioning yourself into the right spot so it glows and can be interacted with. Mildly annoying for treasure, but a serious liability when you're trying to use consoles in the heat of battle. Consoles themselves are painful to manage, interacting with them locks your movement keys. The chatbar is also a huge pain, as well as being very buggy. The button to close the chatbar (tab) also opens the scoreboard, which you have to hit tab again to close.Neither your personal weapons, nor the submarine itself, can be properly aimed up or down. You get about 45 degrees of inclination and declination, which is a huge pain in a gameworld that is so heavy on verticality. It makes combat and steering awkward.Combat, at least initially, is highly repetitive. Which is bad because it's the core of the game. Leftclick to attack, or more likely, hold leftclick to spam swings. That's literally it, attacks can't be aimed, there's no stamina, no timing, no heavy strikes or dodges. You just click and hold until something dies.It gets a bit better when you unlock some ranged weapons, i was fond of hurling dynamite. But at that point the game's camera becomes your main enemy. It's zoomed in way too far, and you can't pan around. So anything more than a couple feet infront is offscreen. You practically have to get into melee range to use ranged weapons, or else fire blindly offscreen and pray. The close camera is an issue for submarine combat too.If you die in any manner, you can be revived at the cost of a permanant loss of 20% max health. According to the wiki there's no way to undo this. Dying is already pretty easy, yyour tiny health pool forces you to sprint back to the sub to rest every 30 seconds. one mistake and you're screwedRight now, combat on foot seems to be the main meat of the gameplay, you land in a cave and explore it. But it's just awkward and repetitive.Submarine combat is a bit better. One person steers the sub, one mans the guns. The turret turns terribly slowly, but that's a fitting choice for the nature of the game. However it doesn't mesh well with some other choices. For example every early enemy is melee based.  Generally giant sharks, squids, etc. They charge at your sub and just hug you, chewing away. The biggest issue is that enemies can pass through you, so they can go from one side of you to another in half a second, while your turret takes several painful seconds to rotate.The best you can really do is guess which direction they're going to go, and rotate the turret in advance to point there. it really is guesswork, since enemies stop for a couple seconds and charge suddenly, there's not much prediction.There doesn't seem to be much story or context to speak of. There are some interesting events - like a ghost ship crashing into you, or a time traveller appearing on your ship. But these have very little narrative and seem to exist as a framework for more of the awful foot combat, by dropping intruders onto your sub. Everything comes back to the combat and it can't carry the gameIt's also full of bugs, probably par for the course in early access, but bears mentioning. The scoreboard and chatbar are both buggy, you frequently end up halfway through floor, arms get stuck in odd poses, and whenever you're close to another player you seem to take control of their head and it looks at your cursor, instead of showing you where they're looking.Last, but not least, crewing problems.This is advertised as a game for 2-4 players. I have two - myself and a friend. There's also a small ship which specifically states it's intended for a crew of two.But frankly, this game is not fit for two people.  There are three critical roles on a ship.The pilot has to steer. This is emphasised by the rather baffling design that the pilot can't stop the ship. The sub can only be stopped or started by altering power in the engine room. So the pilot is glued to the steering wheel at all times, lest you crashA gunner has to shoot. this is pretty important in combat if you want to not die. the shield wont last long, and you can die very fast once its down. The two ship weapons available (machinegun and torpedoes) can only be switched between by altering power in the engine room. If she leaves the guns, nobody is shooting and fights will never end.And an engineer is needed to repair breaches, adjust power levels for the above two, and fight off boarders.Given there was only two of us, we try our best to be pilot and gunner without a dedicated engineer, but it fails badly. Something is always left undone if one of us has to leave their console. The ship simply cannot be crewed effectively by less than three peopleThis could be ameliorated by adding a brake for the pilot, so they could at least pull over in order to go fix thingsIn summary, the game has a lot of issues, some in design, some bugs, and a great many sharp edges that need smoothed out. Since combat is the core gameplay, it needs a lot more depth, skill and complexity. The exploration needs some purpose to it. And if the game is seriously meant for 2-4 people, then some work needs to be done on making sure its properly playable at both extremes.4.5/10, in need of a lot of work yet."

Challenging, sure.  Lame too.  Counter-intuitive.  Players choose between being effective in combat and being effective at repairs.  On the item selection screen it actually shows 2 slots with only 1 slot available for interaction, which implies that this feature simply isn't implemented yet.2:  There's a massive, huge, horrible game bug where sometimes holes and even enemies appear for Player A (the holes fill the ship with water that can drown all the players and the enemies attack all the players) but no player but Player A can see the hole or the enemies.  This is especially awful when Player A is the helmsman or the gunner, especially if they've chosen to bring along say a firearm instead of a wrench so there's no point getting off their station, and isn't even looking for holes in the ship.3:  The mechanic where more enemies spawn the faster the ship moves is stupid.  It's stupid.  The whole idea is idiotic.  The enemies should be there to begin with and if you're moving too fast and attract the attention of more of them than you can handle at a time, that's one thing, but making them actually appear out of nowhere just because you're moving fast is stupid.  Having them spawn right on top of the ship, rather than out some distance where the gunner would have time to actually get off a shot at them before they start biting/stabbing/attaching-to the ship, is even stupider.  There isn't actually a manual or even a legitimate, official wiki for this game where the devs explain this - it's just hinted at in one of the silly ""newspaper"" headlines that appears whenever you die in-game and experimentation seems to prove it out.  The lack of a manual or dev-maintained wiki outlining game mechanics deserves its own mention.4:  The game devs, as of 04-27-2017, have released a recent update that includes new cosmetic gear (hats/clothes) and addressing none of the above."

The description says 2-4 players, but so far the sweet spot of players that we've hit is 3. If anything, this isn't a game to play super seriously but a game where you and your friends share a common goal and try to have fun getting there. You can't save in between journeys so every journey is a new beginning.This game is about you and up to 3 friends manning a submarine trying to get to the bottom of an undersea trench. The trench has different zones (we've only made it to two zones so far) with a boss between zones. Within each zone is an undersea cave where you can get an upgrade for your ship and some gear for your characters, such as weapons and tools.I don't usually pick up nor recommend early access games, but this game I would recommend IF you are optimistic in the developers living up to the promises or aren't too picky. Menus are filled with planned features and of course the game is a little rough around the edges right now Buying it on sale for $8, though, my friends already got good laughs out of it."

,Recommended,307110,29931356,Posted: 14 February,all,TwinkleHood,"Let's the the bad out of the way: There's some pretty severe networking issues that can make getting a game together very very difficult and frustrating. Luckily this is alleviated by an incredibly communicative and responsive development team, who I'm sure will have those hiccups ironed out in no time.But once you DO get lobby together, and start the dive with you friends around you, you're in for a challenging, chaotic ride of fun. The idea works really well, and while the difficulty sort of jumps from not-very-hard-at-all to holy-****-what-the-****, we kept wanting to go back and start over when our adventure finally ended in a madness of squids, seaweed, and fish I don't dare guess the names of consuming our boat.I'm a huge fan of how little your overall progress moves with each game, the biggest thing being giving you some gold to pimp your hipster seafarer up with cosmetically. I do like looking fancily silly as i shout at my friend over the internet to not ****ing abbandon his post, while I'm trying to cut off the arm of a squid which just penetrated our engineroom.Fair warning, you CAN play as two, but you probably won't be able to get very far. Maybe the game should give you like an extra bar of electricity or something for when you're two, because once you pass into the darkness, you're pretty much done for. 3 works super well."

It kind of has a Don't Starve kind of steampunk feel to it, but less focused on material grinding and more exploration. Theres some bugs and glitches here and there, but that's to be expected from an early access game; it can only get better from here!"

,Recommended,307110,29789269,Posted: 8 February,all,lietu,"Short version: Some connection issues, but if it works it's a LOT of fun! 30 second summary of the game:https://clips.twitch.tv/lietu/FancyChickenRuleFiveLong version:Got this on day 1 of Early Access, and completely without testing or preparation fired it up with a couple of guys from around the planet.The online lobby system is a bit problematic, sometimes the game takes a full minute to be able to connect, complaining about online components initializing or similar. Only one of the 3 of us was able to successfully host a game so the other 2 were able to join it - I tried to host and someone outside of our group was able to join, but neither of the other 2 players I was playing with could join. I could not join any server unless I had a VPN on, with the VPN on the component initialization issue wasn't there, but I couldn't join anything. Quite odd, would love to get more information on how to make this work better, by doing port forwarding or similar. The latency and other issues that the VPN likely caused apparently made the game lose sync of the status of things, and broke our ability to navigate the ship completely a few times. You cannot simply invite the friends you want to the game, and you cannot kick off players from the lobby, or set a password.However, once you get the game running it's a LOT of fun. We had a party of 3 guys on Discord voice chat, and it was a constant stream of ""oh no a shark!"", ""cut the engines"", ""leak in navigation"", ""WHAT IS THAT?!"". Lots of very fun hectic moments with everyone running around the sub trying to fight off the monsters attacking the sub and fixing leaks, while trying to balance power distribution and keep torpedo tubes loaded.While it's rogue-like, there is some permanent progress in the game. You collect gold in caves, and you can use that to unlock certain kinds of apparel and tools.The game feels great for an Early Access -title on first day, the only problems we really had was with the lobby system and connections in general, and I can see this game being absolutely amazing fun in the future as they make the online connectivity better.Our longest run lasted a little under 30 minutes and the time simply flew by. Everyone had a great time, and was constantly busy, and we had a feeling that we were progressing even when we encountered issues like when we couldn't navigate the sub due to some bug.So, while the game has some network issues the game is still a lot of fun to play. Another thing worth noting is that it looks like the game will be very hard to play with only 2 people, with 3 people it was really hard and only with 4 did it seem like we had enough time to manage status quo, but when things got hairy we still had a hard time keeping up with things.For a full video of our ~30min run that shows how hectic it can be check outhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/120656126"

There also needs to be a way to exit from the item selection screen or be able to see everyone who has confirmed their items and if its someone being a troll to be able to kick them as the host.Other than some simple things its been fun to explore the depths of the ocean with friends and fight off crabs, squids, and other sea creatures trying to find treasures.Two big thumbs up!"

Its always updating and the upadates are usually enjoyable. My only issue is the boss fights are usually not quite as enaging as you might want lots of areas to just kind of camp the bosses not that exciting but everying between that is wicked fun.
