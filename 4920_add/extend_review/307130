There are a lot of cheap deaths. World design is beyond uninspired. Very small selection of weapons (most of which you won't use). Infuriating last boss (lots of one hit kills and cheap moves to boot). Awkward interface (you can only use items in your bar at the bottom). No interesting items to make. No base building.I completed this game and was underwhelmed from start to end. Most of my time playing was spent cursing the mechanics. Anything not taken directly from Terraria proved to be horrible and annoying, particularly the oxygen system. Also when you get hit, there is no break between damage, so an enemy standing on you drains your health very fast. Who puts that in a game? Who played that and went ""yes, this is a satisfying element of the game"". Does anybody EVER enjoy that?The game is not challenging (I completed it in a day), but just frustrating. It is almost like someone made a bland game and then went down a check list of ""bad design choices"" and chose a few to add in. The last boss is horrible as well.Do not bother with this game."

,Recommended,307130,11063585,"Posted: 4 July, 2014",all,Inle,"Here's my first impression - it's not a crafting game. No, sure there are crafting elements, but you should be aware that mostly it is a ""metroidvania"" game where you explore the world. It's core is action. Jump, shoot, dodge. You gather resources by finding it in the wilds and by killing enemies.Your first weapong is a ""pew-pew blaster"" (which is actually just a ""pew blaster"" because of it's fire rate). I've found hunting complicated with such a tool. And I've tripped into first boss after 10 minutes of game. 700 hp vs 20 dmg per shot...Also - you have lives. Once you lose all of them you die? Dunno.The controls are responsive and the aiming/shooting process done really good. And the game works smoothly, but to do so I had to play with screen resolution. The game eats a lot of resources because it's a procedural full destructible world.TL:DR As much as I've seen I would recommend this game to those players who love Edge of Space, Signs of Life, maybe Starbound AND want to see somethingcompletely different. Nice metroidvania game with a touch of your regular sandbox crafting game. My personal score so far is 7/10. Cheers.P.S. Will update the review with my progress through the game."

Instead, you mine resources for the first dungeon, then go that dungeon, after it you mine resources for the second dungeon and so on. Dungeons themselves are not generated but hand crafted instead, completely breaking the sandbox atmosphere. The worse thing is that the most of the time you spend in every dungeon is jumping on platforms, falling down, and parkour again and again.Overally the game gets very dull and boring once you begin to understand its non-sandboxness. There are no trees, no houses, no decor, it's not even near Terraria."

As a non-early access game it is hard to say how much more development, if any, will take place with this title, thus I can't recommend it."

It requires you to go through the highest dungeon you can find by crafting a dungeon drone (or whatever they are called), so craft mining tool -> collect materials -> find dungeon -> beat dungeon -> craft next gen mining tool -> repeat- the combat feels bad, never noticed this before but it feels bad when there is no ""pause"" in between damage ticks when one touches an enemy, you can simply drain your entire life in a second with the right kind of mob - none of them having an attack animationI am very sorry not to find anything enjoyable with this game, it looked nice actually. :/"
,Recommended,307130,12575189,"Posted: 19 October, 2014",all,Rascilon,"Asteria delivers a mixed experience.  If you are a fan of games like Terraria, where crafting and exploration take center stage, Asteria's game mechanics will feel very familiar.  Set in a futuristic world, you are the lone explorer on an alien world.  Instead of Terraria's pickaxes, you have a energy gun that breaks apart dirt and rock alike.  Despite the intriguing premise and occasionally clever game mechanic like however, Asteria disappoints in several ways.  First, and most noticably, is the crafting system, which, while varied, does not provide tool tips or organization that helps the player figure out how to obtain the next material.  You never quite know whether a required upgrade will need to be crafted or found as a creature drop, and trial and error is the only way to find out.  It would have been helpful to have an indication that certain resources were only obtainable from killing certain mobs.  The second thing that I found disappointing was the difficulty.  The main game play is quite simple, as there is no real penalty for death other than backtracking your spawn point, but boss fights are another question entirely.  I felt that the boss fights were much harder than regular gameplay, and for me, had the effect of bottlenecking me at important progression points.  While games like Terraria use a similar progression system for obtaining new gear, in Terraria you usually have multiple boss fights and upgrade paths to alleviate the frustration of continually failing at the same boss.  Unfortunately, with Asteria, you need to try and fail repeatedly without the benefit of any alternate route or upgrade path.  On the positive side, the background graphics and audio are quite well done, even if the actual platformer foreground graphics are somewhat drab and uninspired.  The game does support the Steam Overlay as well as widescreen and multiplayer modes, but lacks controller support.  In all, Asteria is a game that will appeal to sandbox gamers and platform gamers alike, but will likely frustrate more casual players."

Later on when you farm ores, etc you'll have great items with which to do so and cut large swaths of the world away.Pros-Gameplay, Music, Exploration-Items don't require you to figure out paterns, everything you can build is clearly outlined, you just need the materials.-When you mine, gas is expended so you can't continually mine. You have to be smart about how you do it so that the gas escapes upwards into the atmosphere.  This sounds like it's annoying but it's actually a good feature.-Inventory is limitless, so no micro managing how much stuff you can carry.-Controlls.  They are exactly the same as Terraria; which is perfect.-Weapons , there are some really neat weapons in the game and the weapon progression isn't to steap.I havn't had a chance to set off the nuke yet :)Cons-When crafting it defaults to making the MAX # of a unit.  This screwed me late in the game because of a mistake I made crafting way to many of an expensive item.  I forgot to quit without saving..-There's a bug or issue with portals sometimes in which you go back to the starting area of the game, not the portal you're saved too.  I lost where my home base was and it took me about 2 hours to find it again :)This is arguably not a con!Summary:If you like Terraria, you'll like this for a good 10-20 hours if you're so inclined to finish it.

,Not Recommended,307130,33777361,Posted: 24 July,all,Verdantil,"Tags: Sidescroll - Survivor & QuestingAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from LibraryTLDR: None of the addictiveness of other sidescroll survival game. Asteria is just a weak aimless metroidvania with intept aiming and confused end user interface in a procedurally generated blandlandscape.Review: Those who compared this to Starbound and Terraria were absolutely correct. The navigation of the interface and menus is made fairly difficult with the gamepad and I would almost recommend KB+M setup over it despite the platforming elements. The crafting table left me pretty underwhelmed and unimpressed and constituted of just a collection of random components to spawn certain items. There did not seem to be a huge selection of stuff to even make, and most of it was better version of a previous thing. From what I saw you cannot actually build environments and make instead gear and whatnot. THe world is a procredurally generated boring collection of water bodies, caves and uneven terrain with the occasional dungeon portal scattered around that you play as a standalone instance with chests in it. The twin stick aiming felt really sluggish on the controller, with way to much time spent rotating the aiming reticle around. This was made even more annoying in that the protag will face whichever direction he shoots in, not whichever direction he walks towards. Which meant that I often found myself rotating all the way around just because it was bugging me that I was walking backwards after taking a turn down a tunnel. The combat system seems to be sci fi laser related, and I would assume gets a tiny bit of diversification and mostly power boost with upgrades. The game uses very tiny tiles to make graphics which gives it a nice and polished look. At the same time, you could see the tiny tiles as gigantic pixels, which in fact they are once you realize that their color are just tiled texturing themselves. So once your brain starts to factor all that in the game keeps a firmly low budget feeling despite the effort. I thought the backgrounds looked much better than the foregrounds.The audio featured some electronic music and weak sound effects for combat, the repetitiveness of the spider sound was getting grating. The controls themselves felt okay for character movement but the camera behavior, as it scrolled the screen around and tried to stay centered when jumping felt jarring, which suprised me given how zoomed out the action is to begin with.This was just a first impression but Asteria left me feeling like it offered the worst of both worlds, all the restrictiveness of a classic platformer. The hybridization with the RPG genre through crafting elements felt crude and not fully implemented or thought out. But you did not even get handcrafted level design and instead are left with geographical messes with lack of interesting features and a bunch of randomly generated ressources all represented by samey looking tiny icons."
,Not Recommended,307130,13310167,"Posted: 10 December, 2014",all,Imban,"I was looking forward to playing this, as a big Terraria fan, and ended up kind of let down. In practice it basically felt like a series of nine Terraria challenge maps with a break for mining the stuff you needed for the next tier of gear in between them. Since most of the actual content in the game is in the nine hand-crafted dungeons, there's also not all that much replay value, because the actually interesting and difficult areas will be the same every time, which is kind of a letdown for a sandbox game - you should probably just treat it as a platformer with somewhat pointless Terraria-esque mining segments between the levels.As far as base-building goes, it gives you some interesting tools like different ""brushes"" for painting terrain, but there's ultimately neither much reason nor much capability to build anything interesting - you only really need a storage area for chests (""hypercubes"") of unused items and all of five different workbenches, and that can fit in a tiny dirt hovel. Meanwhile, there's actually not many interesting building materials in the game, most of which aren't available until you're halfway through the game, really limiting options that aren't just a dirt hovel. The block size is also absolutely miniscule, which has some benefits when it comes to base-building because it allows for fine control of what things look like, but it also makes it more difficult to build simple things for people who don't need that fine control.Probably the biggest thing that made me dislike the game, though, was that it had janky controls. What seems like fairly simple jumps can be frustratingly difficult, and often failing them is punished with instant death spikes. Some of the challenges are also set up terribly, like Cave Dive and the second part of the final boss, to the point where my friend and I were reduced to just swearing at the game incoherently for a while. (The final boss also basically didn't work in multiplayer at all, unfortunately, lagging my friend out completely - another major point off.) The tiny blocks are perhaps even worse in the platforming sense, because they make it hard to tell whether an area is mined-out enough that you can fit through it, or if there's a teeny-tiny block in the way of a jump, or what, since the mining beams, while appropriately fast, can miss single blocks very easily. Similarly, while there's a large variety of weapons, most of them are of very limited use except for the basic blaster and the homing missile, such that time spent crafting them is basically wasted. Or not, if you psychically know in advance that the next boss is one of the only ones actually vulnerable to the disruptor.On the plus side, nuclear bombs are hilarious and destroy things in ways that seem physically impossible. Not that this is ever really useful to you, but they sure let you take out your frustration on the game world.In the end, I can't recommend Asteria, not even to fans of Terraria challenge maps. Everyone else should definitely stay away, however."

The character animations felt stiff, the character its self was uninspired. A nameless faceless human in a suit. There is no sense of strife or want.The story line feels like an after thought and does not at all engage the player throughout the game. What I would have liked to see here is some form of player > story interaction. Something to the tune of - Instead of building a probe to find a simple portal that takes you to a static dungeon. How about a dying human survivor that you find in an bombed out human settlement that you save and give treatment, that will then guide you to the dungeons if you can get him the parts to track them down. - see pretty simple, and it would engage the player in atleast a very small manner and give the illusion that the story line is not just the begining and the end.You can even use it to create some level of emotional impact. Such as he sends you to rescue his family and when you get there you find them being infested or assimilated, or hell they are fine and you get them back safely only to find out later they had a tracking device on them and now the guy has been grabbed as well and your base was destroied, queue rescue and boss fight.

There is no customisation for your character other than the colour you pick at the start.The crafting is pretty basic and is really just upgrading your weapons/armor/accessories on every new tier you hit.You fight a boss to unlock next tier of materials which is usually involving a dungeon crawl. Some of them are interesting but that's really the only content that was worth it to me as the world itself is pretty bland and doesn't offer much.It's very fast paced, epsecially in the later tiers when your mining tool mine so fast and wide that you can basically run/float across screen at full speed even though it's solid ground.There are a selection of weapons you can use but I really didn't see much point in using anything other than the normal blaster or ocassionally the homing missile.In terms of difficulty, it's not very hard in general, only the first couple of tries on each boss to learn how you can take them out.In my playthough I didn't finish the game due to an annoying crash 10 minutes in on the last dungeon for me which reverted my progress back two tiers which was quite upsetting but I felt like I experienced most of the game any way.So at the end..

Other reviewers have experienced the same thing, its nothing but a numbers battle, very unimaginative design, anything it didnt steal directly from terraria (Except the projectile-based mining! That is the ONLY redeeming mechanic I found, personally... but the rest of it..) was not very good. Clunky inventory/hotbar, movement feels very rigid, and aside from increased jump and reduced fall damage, theres nothing cool like a jetpack or wings or doublejump to help you move around.For ten bucks there is quite a few more action platformer survival games that will keep you playing for longer, and have a better progression model, as well as much more varied content, as this is reall just ""Mine to next portal, clear, craft, mine to next portal....""There are some pretty obvious and game breaking bugs too... i hesitate to mention them here so...********Spoilers/Exploits*********I could have probably had a bit more difficulty with the game, but, I love my hardware and I macro'd a fire button and since the blaster has 0 cooldown it fires rather fast, gg until tier 4, then I found out if I hold an item and shoot it would (About 80% of the time) fire charged up shots rather than standard ones, and still work with my macro, so I had a rapid-fire charged blaster to get me through some of the tougher battles (Which as I said, were just high damage enemies, nothing ""Hard"")************************end exploits/spoilers**TLDR: Great concept as games like Terraria have proven, but heavily lacking in content and very short. Also some very game breaking exploits/bugs. For ten bucks you might as well spring for Terraria, or Edge of Space, or countless other games in this genre.

Parts are too easy, parts too hard, and all of it is - at least to me - boring.Let's begin with enemies. You get the first blaster after a few seconds, and... well, if you don't stupidly jump into deep caves or something, enemies pretty much won't touch you. Yes, some of them have ranged attacks. You learn to avoid those - quickly.The only exception: Bosses. The first boss is too hard, with any equipment you are able to get until you encounter him. It's frustrating, and after an hour of trying again and again, I gave up.And mining? Well, shooting at dirt with a... mining blaster? That's probably the best word. So, shooting at dirt with a mining blaster, collecting an infinite stack of dirt... and some decidedly less than infinite amounts of useful materials. If the floods of non-threatening enemies don't annoy you to death first.Lastly, crafting. It's quite easy to create the first three crafting stations... which are needed for many items, the materials for which are probably available after many weeks of playing non-stop. The few items you can craft in the beginning are nearly useless.Seriously, this game needs a manual just to explain which parts SHOULD be enjoyable...So, really, nice try, but I really can't recommend this game, as much as I'd like to."

The higher ranks of the mining laser get increased firing rate and at later ranks gain a larger weapon spreads.There are a small assortment of weapons each with different ""ranks"" but each rank of weapon shoots the same with just increasing amounts of damage and a different hue of colour.The armour has no change of appearance for the player and you craft a chest piece and a helmet and a energy core for a shield each level.This is repeated over and over for each new dungeon.There is a relatively okay amount of monster types, But they are quickly reused, resized and recoloured.It felt like the inventory had more slots than there are materials in the game and materials stack exceedingly higher to accommodate the hoover of a mining laser.The one redeeming quality of this game is that it is open sourced and can be modified."
76561197983550854,Recommended,307130,11536765,"Posted: 3 August, 2014",all,Zamboni -  fotzepolitic,"Game is fantastic!I suppose the most relevant game for comparrison is Terrarria.  Of course with that game and many countless games similar to this nothing really kept me playing more than a handful of minutes for one time.  I realize that the openess is a draw for alot of folks but for me it's just like what the point.  It needs to offer and exceptional setting and fun mechanics to make me want to play a game not character and narritive driven like most games i play.  This game does that exceptionaly.First off it is Sci-fi setting which I'm far more inclined to prefer than any other. Plus although the main world is apparently random generated the first time you create it it seems the systems for the world are well laid out in the way the geologic layers work.  So the game has a massive world map, more so i think than any game i've ever played relative to the fact that there is no map system for the game, a cool challenge for me I found.  The game itself on the alien world is starting out and through your actions like an ant farm next to a few million others, its that massive.The game has a straightfoward combat system in that you shoot stuff with the lmb and some of them (enemies) shoot back, jump or do other things at you.  Combat requires skill but not a twitch fest, though sometimes you need to be very careful and aware due to the way they spawn, or come out of the dark sometimes.The large majority of the game you will be digging/mining whatever you prefer to call it.  It's basically an alt weapon, though can't function as one that blasts away materials that comprise the ant farm.  You dig tunnels to progress further down and to the side exploring but also to go after the rarer materials, like your ores and gems, etc.  the rock foundations (grantie, basalt, etc) can be used to build but thats a small part of the game.So besides the huge world map there are about 10 dungeons, those are not randomily generated and often are abit more platformy, though you'll have plenty of jumping experience in the main part.  Also there are bosses and some of these levels and bosses are a damn challenge and beautiful crafted.  Your reward for finishing those is an item that you can then use to craft the next level of mining tool which you will need to progress through the next type of rock layer.   I never found that to be grinding as its simply a function of the game.The crafting is cool fun, going after the spare parts and resources usually is just done through digging like crazy on the sediment level you are able to, by no means will you have to scour it all to build all you need.  I set up a base with the different crafting machines and spawn point at most sediment levels.  That's the other thing this is not a game where you have to be overly concerned with death which for me is a great thing as i know many perfer that ""rogue"" aspect that's usually just not for me.The music is so great to and seems to be fairly responsive to changing to certain types of actions/progressions.  That helps because you also will be hearing the ""pew pew"" of your weapon and mining laser for many hours.  Also because you hold down to use them mostly i found my hand would cramp a couple times which i think its been years since a game has done that to me.Other than that my only complaint is as you progress further down the overall ambient lighting is very dim, and the lights you can place have a very small area of affect as does the headlamp you can create.  I realize thats supposed to be there as you more or less are nearing the core of the planet.  Still it would have been nice to have a brightness option in the game.Overall a solid game and a stellar blend of exporation, platforming, crafting, and it's own unique charm."

The crafting is a blast and working for ever-better gear is very rewarding.I have two major complaints, however.One, the player is FAR too large for a game like this. It's very annoying to get constantly hung up on various small bits of terrain that you missed, especialy when mining in caves.Second, the game's difficulty is very inconsistent. Usually, the enemies are little threat to you unless you're heavily outnumbered or ambushed. The bosses, however, are mind-blowingly difficult. You come to really dread challenging the boss of the next dungeon (even though it might be a part of the design) because you know he's gonna be a mean ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and he is going to wipe the floor with you. The sometimes clunky jumping controls are currently giving me a damn nightmare on the third boss, which is where I'm currently stuck. If I can state some advice; you may laugh at the idea of energy refills when you first unlock them, but you'll use every last one during a boss battle, and wish you had more. The huge hitbox of the player character doesn't help at all, and the fact that spawned minions can sometimes carry over from previous boss attempts (sometimes with upgraded attack or defense) makes it extremely difficult to even get in range of the boss without being swarmed. It all feels rather cheap, in a sense.However, so far I am really enjoying the game, and the sense of accomplishment you get when you finally sneak that shot in and kill a boss is very intense, and is then reinforced by the loot you get. It's kind of like the effect Dark Souls has; death over and over again, and then success is unrivaled in satisfaction. All in all, I'd definitely give this game a try. I'm certainly enjoying it.Back to pulling my hair out over this boss. Damn, I'm out of energy refills. I'm ♥♥♥♥ed."

The gameplay mechanics are decent. I suppose it could be compared to Terraria but it's more fast-paced and action centered. Here's where the cons start. When you first fire up the game, you'll be astounded by the wondrous soundtrack. At least I was, anyway. That said, over time I realized it was just looping the same track over and over again, so the once brilliant soundtrack became repetitive and annoying. The second and largest con-(for me anway)-is the lack of enviromental variety. There's only a handful of backgrounds and textures that are meant to illustrate the different enviroments. The truth is, there's barely any variation in the world at all. It was truly disappointing. Those are the major problems with the game, although there are some smaller things. For example, the lack of character creation. You're given a set of different colored suits to choose from, there's no real free creation. The graphics are slightly blurry and lackluster, but it's not a game-breaker. The enemy AI is horrible; they get stuck in small holes and can't find you.In conclusion, it's an alright game for a few hours, but it can get old, even with the bosses. I still recommend picking it up however."

The key selling point is the openness of the game; in which you are given free reign to go and do whatever you please from the first second.

You are not forced to follow a linear path; you can simply play the game as you like, which ultimately results in an immensely fun experience.It uses a mix of beautiful pre-drawn backgrounds, while, in the foreground, we get equally pretty 32-bit style graphics that evokes Super Metroid – we control a hero who wears a combat suit that could put Master Chief to shame, running around the sub-terrain killing many strange enemies, all stylised in a dark but undeniably very pretty way. Indeed, Asteria wins many points in the visual department.Asteria doesn’t just impress in the gameplay, fun and graphical department, it also sounds amazing. The gameplay is accompanied by a rousing soundtrack that wouldn’t feel out of place in a big-budget Hollywood movie. It really contributes to the scale of the game; the worlds you can play in are massive, and the music appropriately reflects that.The idea of a large and non-linear game may sound daunting to many, but this game has a lot to offer, and as such, Asteria is worth your time.
