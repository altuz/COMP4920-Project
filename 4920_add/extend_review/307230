76561198167158893,Recommended,307230,13291969,"Posted: 9 December, 2014",all,vh_ron,"Zombie apocalypse from new perspectiveFirst of all, this idea is brilliant! But how this game looks like? It is 2D game, you are zombie, you are outnumbered by civilians and soldiers. Your goal is to convince everyone to become zombie, usually by biting. Civilians are cowards, so they just run, but soldiers are brave and they have guns. You have to be smart and always try to outnumber your enemies. You can give simple orders to your small zombie army and develop new tactics.Game is simple, but enjoyable, graphic and music are ok - it is indie production after all. Flaws? Yes, it's too short and I want it on my Lumia!Best regards and have fun!"

Got it in a bundle for about 35c and was easy at that price 8.5/10.  At $1.99 it is still okay, but you have to really like the genre since you will be hard pressed to get 2 hours play out of this. 4.5/10."

A game for casual gamers, where you can control your very own army of Zombies and cause havoc? I am game!So, you have your very own little zombie and you are given your first tutorial mission. This mission is just to be sure that you know how to use the directional keys and understand the basic concept that if you are a zombie and try to close to an unarmed human, they will run from you. And if for some reason you manage to stand just long enough next to them, well.... yey, you just made a new zombie friend.After the tutorial and the first couple of levels, you realise what I,Zombie will be all about -  a combination of a stealth / puzzler game, with a brief touch of RTS. All in all, it is a relatively short game, with only 20 levels. However, level design is solid. It has a nice learning curve and level difficulty increases gradually.The soundtrack, in its never ending loop combines well with I,Zombie , and the visuals are quite nice for this little game. I particularly like the main zombie design, as it sort of reminds me a Tim Burton meets Simpsons combination. Oh well, Danny Elfman had already set that link before, so perhaps that concept isn't so far fetched.In short, these are the things I can point out as positive in I,Zombie - The concept, level design, the soundtrack and the main little zombie. Seems like we are heading for a masterpiece!Now the painful bit....The first thing I have noticed after initial seconds of gameplay was that there controls weren't very responsive. There seems to be a lag between hitting a button and the character acting on it, and it becomes incredibly frustrating playing throughout levels of stealth without really knowing where your character's movement will end. I came to realise that as you lower the resolution, I,Zombie will run faster and the commands will become more responsive... but at this point I have started questioning myself if I it was fair to expect having fluidity issues with a Unity based game. However, lowering the resolution will reduce the game window, and if you fall lower than 800 x 600, I would recommend that you play it through with the aid of a magnifying glass.Apart from unresponsive controls, I have often struggled with basic movement. More often than not, my little Zombie would get stuck on the edge of a box or some other obstacle, without being very clear why.The combination of broken controls with some movement issues turned almost every level into a trial an error experience. And whereas in the first couple of levels I was still going for the 3 stars rating, the frustration soon took over me and my main goal became powering through the 20 levels I,Zombie had to offer.Eventually I had another go in reaching max stars and beating I,Zombie in less than 15 minutes, in order to complete the achievements. Unfortunately this ended up as another disappointment, as for some reason they still appear as ""incomplete""Apart from the nice basic visuals, I,Zombie also had a couple of graphic glitches as the constant flickering of white lines all over the place or the glitchy rain effects (which seem completely unnecessary and don't bring any added value to the game).To sum up, it is a nice game, with a nice concept and ideas and solid map building. However, the several flaws it has turn what should be an enjoyable game into a frustrating experience. At some point you have to wonder if the fact it is so short is actually a thing for it or against it.However, I do think that the price is fair an is often on steam sales. If you are curious, by all means get it, but don't expect a masterpiece.Note to the developers: I am quite sure you have put quite an effort into it, please don't see my review as just someone taking a shot at you. I can see that there are plenty of people recommending I,Zombie... I am just not one of them :)"

Each level is an increasingly challenging puzzle, where you must zombify every human on the map before they can kill you.Unfortunately, an otherwise very fun game is harmed by simple problems. The AI and hit windows are both maddeningly inconsistent, meaning that several levels can only be beaten when these things choose to work for you rather than against you, leading you to several needless restarts."

The ai tends to get stuck on walls, resulting in some frustrating restarts, and enemies have inconsistant range and vision. Ai is the major problem with the game. Trying to get them past turrets without any of your zombies dying to get a 3 star rating is just extremely frustrating (looking at you level 18). Also I'd like to be able to select which of my zombies do what, rather than controlling the whole mob at once, it would've made for some more interesting strategies. The game definitely still has room to improve."
76561197971341065,Recommended,307230,15082800,"Posted: 27 March, 2015",all,sfnhltb,"This is pretty decent little action puzzle game, albeit with not much in the way of replayability beyond redoing the levels until you find the way to keep all your zombie minions alive on each level.The gameplay is pretty simple - you start off a lone zombie who has to infect everyone in the level (with a couple of exceptions where you have to dodge the patrolling guards and just munch on the scientist at the end, and one case where you start off with a single turned zombie on the opposite side of the map with yourself trapped and unable to move), and each level basically you have to work out which groups of civilians or soldiers you should attack in what order, and with what timing on their patrol route in order to avoid getting your brains blasted out before you get to them. Early levels are pretty straightforward, the later levels tend to require a bit more planning of where to go and when, plus along the way there are a few tips and tricks you can pick up of how to manage your fellow zombies.Your resources for each level are yourself - faster than the rest, and you control yourself directly with the cursor keys (or probably gamepad, haven't tried and the keys worked fine for me), and the zombies you have turned in the level so far which can be set to follow you, stay where they are, or attack the nearest non-zombie. Once you learn how to manage your brethren they can be used as a shield to cover your approach to a patrolling soldier, a distraction to let you get in closer before being shot at, or set up to attack the other of a pair of patrolling soldiers that are too far apart to just rush from one side. Your comrades can be a bit annoying and snag on the scenery occasionally, and they are really annoying to try and get past the sentry guns intact when a level requires that, but apart from those things the game plays pretty smoothly.Once you have completed a level and survived you can move onto the next level, or replay it and try to find a way to complete the level without any zombies dying in the process, thus earning three stars. There are twenty levels (plus a training mission) to work through, and particularly the last half of them tend to be interesting and may take a while to figure out a good plan of attack, or get the timing right. Once that is done there is also potentially a bit of replayability trying to find a faster route to win each level, but beyond that it is not really the sort of game you will go back to again, as once you know how to do each level there isn't much more to gain from it. But it is quite fun to go through that one first time."

All 3 options work pretty fine.One annoying flaw is, that you can easily get stuck on obstacles which slows down your movement.

You command a zombie and have to clear the maps from those pesky humans by converting them to your army.Sadly the execution is lacking. Getting stuck on invisible bumps on a seemingly linear object, soldiers shooting although you should be too far away for them to see you, soldiers concentrating fire on a target that should not be their first priority anymore (due to others being closer) and other little nuggets of joy make this a tedious exercise."

If you can grab the game for few cents and you don't care about getting all achievements done go for it. Otherwise skip this one. It's a quality worth a dozens other free online flash games. Trying to get to 3 stars is purely lucked based in last levels, you can do everything correctly, but still anything of the following can happen: you get stuck behing an invisible obstactle that shouldn't really be there / soldiers decide to shoot your zombie first even though literally every other zombie's closer to them, which ends the level for you / soldiers decide to finish the zombie they started shooting even though other zombies are closer, killing that one zombie and not granting you that 3rd star. The fact that soldier's shooting and your bitting are animated within same time frame is annoying as hell as no matter that you stepped on the soldier in between his shots, you're still bitting the same speed and moment when he's shooting, which leads to so much moments of you dying the same moment soldier got changed it's beyond depresive."
,Not Recommended,307230,25238706,"Posted: 29 August, 2016",all,SupremeS,"I, Zombie is like an irritation snowball. Bear with me, because I know it's a weird analogy, but one that holds surprisingly true.You see, there's nothing majorly wrong with the game, there's just a steady increase of problems and frustrations that slowly gain momentum, until there grow so large you want to smash things with your keyboard. For one, collision detection on objects is extremely poor - especially considering the amount of times you're expected to get the jump on people around on corners. You'll start to rush forward, only for you to suddenly slam to an abrupt stop on an invisible wall, inevitably dying and having to start the whole charade over again seconds later.Another irritant; enemy AI is dishearteningly ruthless and impossible to predict, even though you're expected to do that one ALL the time. Enemies can suddenly start shooting you from the furthest distances and tightest corners, usually leading to your demise. It's also incredibly hard to tell what distance you can stay away from a soldier before they do an instant 180 degree turn and open fire, even though logic dictates that in most situations they simply SHOULDN'T be able to see or detect you. In a game which is all about trying NOT to get spotted until the right moment, having the parameters of when you will be or not as ill-defined as this understandably leads to much hair pulling.There's far more tiny things around just to bug you... Turrets are the biggest threat on the levels they appear, but aren't clearly noticeable and blend into the scenery far too much. Another problem - a few levels in, you're suddenly told to avoid the guards completely, only for confusion to reign as the next level returns things to normal with no warning. Such levels make a return again once or twice throughout the game, with very little warning, meaning knowing what you're actually meant to be doing can easily be misinterpreted.The level editor is a nice idea, but as far as I can tell there's literally NO way of deleting items you're already placed (Maybe I'm being dim, but since the game doesn't tell you the controls for this mode it'd be annoying either way), and the community level filter just acted haywire every time I tried to use it. There's also very, VERY few good levels actually made for you to play, but since the community for this game is logically going to be tiny, I'll let that one slide.All in all, I just got increasingly annoyed the more I played, up until yet another cheap death made me turn away and not think of turning back. It's a shame, because the concept of slowly building up a zombie army to finally swarm the last well-fortified survivors of a level was appealing to me. The reality is, though, is this is a tiny puzzle game with so many little problems that actually making any progress doesn't feel rewarding regardless."

I started playing, and the controls are unresponsive, to the point where I could not for the life of me get the timing right killing the guards. The controls are incredibly floaty, it's like walking on an entire world of ice. Plus, the controls are very imprecise. I end up missing my mark 9 times out of 10. I only got to level 5 before I got fed up with the controls. Speaking of levels, the game is built and runs like an app. Though, a touch screen would probably be more responsive than this. It has a 3 star system, and a total of 30 levels. The interface is also very app-like. The menus look like I should be seeing it on my iPad. Most of my complaints have to do with controls. You get stuck on things, you can't get where you need to be in the time you need, and it's just over-all aggrivating.I can't personally recommend this game, but I would say if you're willing to take the chance, to give it a try.

Once they are dead they will turn into zombies under your control. As expected they aren't smart and the movement speed will decrease if the health is getting lower too. The level will be completed if all humans are dead. Some humans even has weapons and will make things harder. Good thing they are also pretty stupid by walking and patrolling over the same exact line as they have a pattern.There is an ingame tutorialIt's an okay game.Could be repetitive.Ai isn't intelligent. Zombies are almost smarter than the humans.Each level has a 3 star rating and there are around 30 levels.Could be a flash game on a website.Other things.None.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10"

This looks to be an almost decent excuse for the game, made for either tablets or consoles, that was directly ported to PC, with no time whatsoever to change anything.  Literally, there is zero mouse function for this game.  I have not in my entire life since I played games on a Tandy not been able to use the mouse in gaming.  You will navigate the main menu & game with only the keyboard.  But as for the game itself...The cheeky little intro video has IMO, the best thing about this game, the music.  I am not sure if it was done by the person whom made the game itself, but whoever did, if I was ever interested in working on a game with them, this would be the only area I would like to recruit them for.  The music is absolutely great, it is catchy, although repetitive, you don't get tired of playing it, though the short levels you'll be going through.  Oh, yes btw, every single level in the game is extremely short.Because, after about 3-4 of the stupidly simple first few, you'll start to run into the problems of gameplay here.  Your zombie will quite easily get stuck on walls.  As in, NES times levels, stuck on walls.  This game is merciless in allowing you to make mistakes.  Generally getting stuck on a wall, or making a single mistake at the wrong time will cost you your one and only life, and then you restart the entire level.  Now, some of these levels do have some interesting ways you must finish them, so there is a slight bit of entertainment in the figuring out of how to sneak past the guards, and get to the unarmed civilians, which if you can manage to do, you can walk your zombie over to them, their health bars drop, and they become generic zombies under your control.  Now you may very roughly control them with essentially 3 commands: Stay in one place, follow me, go towards the nearest enemy head on and attack it.  These controls are barely good enough to bypass the levels if you are extremely patient, skilled & have a good sense of timing.Speaking of patience, however, this game has even run mine out.  I have the patience of a Hindu ♥♥♥♥ing goat high on mushrooms and weed + Jesus Christ, but this ♥♥♥♥ing game...let's talk about the final level I am on.  I have looked up a video of how to beat it.  I have seen the man in the video able to do it, but he even had to stop his video, play the game for God knows how long, and come back to it once he had figured it out.  In the game the only enemies, are regular green soldiers, and special forces soldiers.  Now, green soldiers will shoot a single bullet at you, that if it hits, will both damage you, and slow you down.  (Who knew zombies had nervous systems, and were affected by things like getting shot.)  These soldiers after a few missions, aren't too difficult to deal with, as if you get to them, like normal civilians, if you damage them enough you can kill & convert them.  The special forces on the other hand, are a totally different thing.  They not only are armed with machine guns, which will spell almost guaranteed death if they hit you with even one bullet, but they are COMPLETELY ♥♥♥♥ING IMMUNE TO DAMAGE.  That's right!  You could walk up to them, and stand there all day long, with some sort of invincibility cheat/God mode turned on, and they will never die.  They are immortal enemies.  Frankly, this is a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game mechanic.  It would have been like, having to fight Starman in Super Maro Bros.In closing, I do not recommend this game, would not recommend this game, ever.  If anything, a soundtrack to this game should be sold, and the game itself taken off the market.  I bought it for 54 cents, and would not pay one for it now, or even DL it if it were free having played it.I'd give this game 4/10, giving 3 points for the great music, and 1 point for the little bit of fun had while playing it."

The colourful rounded artstyle gives way to an oddly cheerful zombie apocalypse. Art asside the gameplay is simple and easy to grasp, sadly though, there isn't much. Commanding your zombies and shambling about as a zombie yourself in this game leaves you feeling as if there could be more. Granted this game focusses more on timing and choosing targets strategically in order to finish the levels with minimal casualties for that 3 star score.On the downside, this game feels like one of many Mobile to PC ports which brings with it a few bugs. One I found particularly troublesome was having to start as administrator because the game would totally lock up on the main menu shortly after launching. Another bug that was a little annoying was when controls were unresponsive for a short period of time, this usually fixed itself within the span of 2-3 seconds but was annoying none-the-less.All in all for it's $2 asking price I'd certainly recomend it for casual gamers and achievement hunters alike."

Yes my time clocked is not that much but I don't intend finishing a game that doesn't appeal to me. The genre is a zombie game which is to me a hit and miss because there are few zombie related things I like in general. Second, and the main reason, is that the level design aren't that interesting to me. They are pretty short, maybe taking half a minute maximum with pretty boring music. I'd rather have some spooky kind of music. There are community levels which you can turn to when the levels are finished.The goal is pretty simple and direct, you have to eat everyone and how lesser zombie friends you let die the less stars you get. When you go near a human you start to eat them they turn into zombies which you can control by giving commands like follow, attack or stop. A losing condition is that when the zombie you play dies you have to redo the level. I think it may be better to then switch to another of your zombies in the field. There are also soldiers in the level trying to kill you when they hit a bullet they slow you. There is a little bit of health regen but it isn't that amazing. The thing I don't like about adding soldiers is that there is no way to counter them. I think they could introduce zombie vomit either disabling their weapon for x seconds, like two seconds, or slowing them on hit or do damage but won't take them over when you kill them with it. I also think it could be less overused when it drained hp if you used it.This game is a good mobile game, a sort of puzzler with zombies but I don't think it's one of the best games out there for pc. This is not for me but it may be for you. If you like zombie games or puzzles this may be something u can try out."

The A.I. for both the civilians and the zombies is practically stupid since they both act similar meanwhile the soldier A.I. is very chaotic and their range is all but constant some of them only have the range of a shotgun and can only shoot you when you are next to them while others shoots you all the way from the other side of the mapIf you really want this game or don't mind rage quitting after being killed or having your entire team killed constantly by a stupid companion/unlimited range group of soldiers than by all means pick up this game."

I cant think of a single game that is in any way similiar to this. Not even one. Completely original. 'Infectanator' and 'Infect Them All'? Never heard of them.This game is considered a strategy game. For me it felt like a rage game because of how stupid the zombies AI is.The soldiers(enemy) damage and range is so OP its ridiculous.Instead of the goal of the game being infect everyone, the goal of the game for me was 'Try not to punch a hole through your laptop'.Basically this game sucks, is really badly made and doesnt deserve a cool name like I, Zombie."

Even eating people isn't presented well, and conversion isn't at all satisfying- perhaps due to the fact that your victim blips out, gets immediately replaced by a zombie, which just idles there waiting for a command. A command you can't easily make, due to the shoddy interface and reluctant control responses.From movement to unit command to interface to gameplay, to stability, this game fails on all counts.1/5"

They do add harder elements in later levels though. Though there aren't many good things other then the concept and easy controls here. The game is short and can be beaten rather quickly. It isn't really even made for long plays as after maybe 15 minutes you'll find you don't have the urge to continue. When controlling your character around corners and walls I often found that you were slowed down rather dramatically for no reason. Worse of all though is the unfair AI who can go from simple to overly difficult if even enemies with guns and a big field of vision. One you are being shot you slow down and your health quickly goes making a lot of deaths happen in a frustrating manner.Overall even for $2 I,Zombie will be worth it for some that plan on playing this a lot but with little content and enough problems to weigh it down I just can't recommend this one when there are better others like it.Score :2/10"

I used to play between breaks at school, do 1 level here, 1 level there. I have to say that this is an extremely rewarding game to play. It causes you to think about all of your actions and strategize about the best and fastest ways to beat the levels. A few goods and a few not so goods to round out this review:Good:- Rewarding Gameplay: Easily the most notable feature. The levels are set up in such a way that it rewards you for your patience and strategy. (or for speed runs: SPEED)- Leaderboards: Though just about everyone has gotten perfect stars on every level in this game, it then challenges you to see how fast of a speed run you can do to beat the levels.- Challenging enough: The levels are challenging enough that you may get stuck on some for a bit, but they are never impossible, as long as you try to formulate some sort of strategy.Not So Good:Short: It's such a short game. I think I have 3 hours logged onto the game and I've completed it with all the achievements. That's not to say that this should deter you at all. It's a short game, but a really great game.Semi-linear completion: Some of the levels are constructed in such a way that you have to comply to the level's mechanics to beat the level, meaning that on some levels, you may be able to have a few different choices of where to go to add to your zombie family first, while some, you will have to follow a set standard of how you beat the level. It's not terrible, but I think it would feel even better to have some more choices. Having said that, it doesn't take away from the gameplay.That's really it! It's innovative and fun with really negligible shortcomings. I would definitely recommend this game. I got it on sale, but after playing it, I totally would have bought it at full price too."

I wasn't entirely sure what to expect... it's labeled as strategy, but sometimes felt like a puzzle game, such as choosing the order and timing or how to avoid the ones you can't do anything about.Yes, it is very short and it would be great if they would add some more levels or modes to the game. I'm seeing reviews saying that there's less than 15 minutes to the game. That's a bold faced lie. If anybody gets a perfect game all the way through on their first and only try in under 15 minutes, they simply cheated. It will take multiple (sometime several) attempts on many levels to get 3 stars and a low time, and you might not get both in the same run. The 15 minutes is a combination of best times for all levels, and since it could take several tries per level, that means it'll almost definitely take over 30 minutes and probably average over an hour. That's still not very long, but it's longer than 15 minutes.It's worth the $2 if you like strategy or puzzle games, otherwise, there's still no reason not to try it out if it's on sale.

I cannot dissagree with this statement. This zombie game is very unique, as you are a zombie (lets call him BOB), and your goal is to infect all the zombies on the level as possible, only infecting them all will result in completion. However, you need to be very stratigic in this game, as loosing a single zombie may be the difference between getting 1 star, 2 star, or even 3 stars! Time to complete the level may also result in how many stars you get, some level (3?) have stars set to how much time you take to complete it, this may also be a very stratigicly difficult part of the game: one of the achievements of this game is to complete the entire game in less that 15 minutes. So replaying levels over and over to get the lowest time possible will likely happen. Despite many achievements being hard to difficult to get, this game is still easy enough to add to your 100% group. In addition, some cons come with the game, mainly being the length of the game, with 21 levels (including a mini-tutorial), it is short. Nevertheless, the game is only $1.99, and it is frequently on sale, and if it not on sale many coupons for the game from 50% to even 90% are flying around steam.79/100 Bananas"

Some levels appear fairly simple in theory but in practice they're quite a bit more difficult as they rely on very tight timing.Here are a few things I really liked about this:- The zombies are very cute and you really do feel bad when you accidentally let them die.- There were a few levels with different objectives thrown into the mix and it provided a nice change.- I LOVE the music.

I find myself constantly getting hung up on the edges of corners or if I stick too close to walls.And all your ""minion"" zombies that follow you have the same problem... in addition to having pretty clunky pathing AI.Had these two factors been executed more cleanly and effectively, I could totally see how the overwhelming difficulty and lethality of the enemy soliders would be justified. However, considering the trouble I have just moving around the game board, it amounts to overkill in my opinion.I still give the developers credit for coming up with such an instantly addicting game, a great and concise premise, art and music... but having to restart every level after 15 a dozen times, I just can't bring myself to care to finish.That said, even at the full price of $2 dollars it's worth a look.

That's it.5) Lack of variety in gameplay. You just dodge/walk to a target, infect, then move on to the next.6) Getting stuck on edges and corners even though you clearly are not touching them.7) Lack of sounds effects.8) Zombie AI needs a bit more work. They often either get stuck or split and go to undesirable directions.Overall it feels like an incomplete game and the devs could have done better. It gets boring when there's only one way to kill targets leaving no room for creativity.  It could have been nice if there were powerups that give you more options to approach and dodge targets like invisibility, decoys, burrowing, turning into a crate, etc. Also adding some more sound effects such as screams when enemies are running away or being eaten by you would break the dullness.I look forward however to an improved sequel."

The price is really cheap even without offer.Cons:1. Game levels is not enough. (Too short for me - complete all achievement in 3 hours).2. Yes, sometimes you can get stuck in corners, but hey, its not a big problem.3.

Short game (3.6 hours for 100%) but also very cheap (49cents USD on sale).  For the first 70% or so, I felt the levels were designed mostly as puzzles: what route should I take around the level to infect all the humans safely.  However, the last 30% of the game felt more like an RTS with poor controls.  Those levels were often more frustrating than fun since precise movement is difficult (you can get caught on obstacles very easily) and you lack direct control over the other individual zombies.Overall, a very inexpensive way to enjoy a couple hours, but the end game can be frustrating."

No key bind change, I prefer WASD instead of arrow keys.Aside that, 100% game completion wouldn't be as hard."

Great decision.Its a top down level based puzzle game where you control a zombie whose job it is to get all the humans to ""join"" his zombie horde. Soldiers, turrets, and other obstacles litter the levels preventing you from doing, but with each new zombie you acquire your player controllable horde becames larger.Controls are simple and intuitive, music is best described as ""fun"" (but defintely fit within the light hearted nature of the game), and levels have a good difficulty curve as they ramp up.If you're a fan of these types of games there easily hours of gameplay to be had and even if not its low price point (especially if on sale) and general goodness meanyou can easily enjoy it for an hour or so and not feel as though you've wasted money."

(Which is a good thing)The game is pretty simplistic and straightforward but gets pretty challenging in the later levels. It's also pretty short but that's not really a valid complaint given that the asking price is $1.99.If you really like zombies and a little bit of strategy then you should definitely give this one a shot.

Games that dideveloperi by Awesome Games Studio is quite simple. Simply kill all the people in the first chapter, you will win. However, in each chapter, also different levels of difficulty. Well, the wait moment until the end, following a review of mine:Positive- Side buttons comfortable enough to control the player in the game by controlling forces. And we also can use the Gamepad Controller to play this game- Music is also nice, fits with the theme of this game.-Graphic For indie games, very nice. Simple, yet cool !!Negative- No sound of human screams if we pursue them, too far for realistic? Not really, because this indie game- Human character in this game has flaws, that is? If they run, and has reached the end of the wall. Human character can not run nowhere else, just ran to the side and also it is very slow to run away from us, so the difficulty is reduced in this game.So if the game is recommended for you?
