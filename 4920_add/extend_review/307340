Thank you.If you'd like to skip straight to Pro's & Con's, please move to the bottom of the page. Thank you.(MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!)How I Found Out About ""Platypus""Oh...this goes way back! Years and years ago. When I was very young, didn't know about things like Steam, or retail PC games, I was always playing Flash games online. One site that I would play on all the time, had a little game called ""Platypus"". This was one of those games you came across that you had to download a free trial that only lasted an hour or so. Of course, I did. I believe the free trial only contained the first level of the game.I loved the game so much. Over about four or five years later, I went on a search to see if I could find the game's main website (Because Steam didn't have the game at the time). I found something similar to it, the game was around $2-$5. I didn't trust the site, so I did not purchase the game. Now, just last night, I noticed ""Platypus"" in my recommended on Steam, so I HAD to buy it. Boy, was it a blast to the past, and a nice thing to see Level 2-5, levels I have never seen before.Unfair First ImpressionsI tend to see a lot of hate forscore attack&shoot 'em upgames. I don't mind these kind of games as long as they are fun for me. ""Platypus"" takes both these genre'. I also see hate forside scrolling shooterswhich ""Platypus"" is also.Therefor, you may here people say bad things about these genre' or about ""Platypus"" itself. Some people will say that about the genre and not even try the game itself. This can rub off on other people, causing them to do the same thing. Then that can rub off, and keep going like a virus.Review Of ""Platypus""""Platypus"" is aside scrollingshoot 'em up/score attackgame. It uses a rare unique graphic style. It usesclaymationwhich means everything you see in-game is made of modeling clay to add a unique design.There are five total levels with about four or five areas in each. In each of these levels you will find a wide variety of enemy types & power ups.Though the game itself isn't really the 'best' as it is quite old, and it seems that the dev. is no longer supporting it, the game still runs smooth. There are no resolution options, nor is there any audio options other than ""Turn Music On/Off"". The Steam overlay also does not work while the game is running.However, the challenge in the game is there. It will get harder as you go along. Anything can destroy your ship, enemy fire, coliding with enemies, etc. When the screen gets really full, you'll find it harder to survive. The challenge isn't to much, that I feel over whelmed. It's a really nice fit.The game also includes a 2-player option. Player 1 (Yellow ship) plays default with the ""mouse"", but a second player (Red ship) can join in under the controls of a ""joy"" or ""keys"" (Arrows to move, control to shoot). Player 1 can also use the different control settings, but both players can not use the same control setup. What's also neat is if you don't have anyone to play the game with, you can spawn in Player 2 and use it yourself, along with your main ship. This is difficult to master, but will help out along the way. Still better to have someone to play with though.Content (Enemies & Power Ups)""Platypus"" contains loads of enemy types, some generic, some unique. The game also includes a few differentpower upsto defend yourself.In ""Platypus"" you can come across enemy ships that fly in an ""up and down"" maneuver, fly straight from left to right, right to left, pull up or go down, etc. Not only that, as the levels go on, you'll notice a lot of the ships to start shooting at you. Now the weapons fired at you could consist of, a single shot in your direction, a fast shot that moves one direction, or other things like ""rockets"" that follow you.To defend youself, you have a few different weapon types. I'll only name a few to avoid spoiling too much. You have your maincannonswhich are default, and have a slow fire rate. Then you have things like the traditionalcannon spreadandcannon fire rate increasedupgrades.Along with weapon types, you also have sort of.....pick ups. That can be dropped from enemies, or crates. These consist of fruit, like grapes, and bananas, which give you score points when picked up. Inside things like crates, you can find items likex2 scorewhich will double your score income, andcoinswhich give off a lot of score.Pro's & Con's (Overall Rating)""Platypus"" is a very fun side scrolling score attack shooter. That is easy to play, and very addictive. Despite it's problems, this game is a cheap purchase that anyone can enjoy for hours. Especially with a friend.Pro's:+Unique claymation graphic style.+Fun & challenging five level experience.+2-player available.+Catchy soundtrack that is full of nostalgia.Con's:-No resolution option.-No custom sound options.-Steam overlay currently does not work (Though this does not degrade the final rating of the game).Overall rating: About a 13/15 (Fun Experience For The Whole Family)Credits & DisclaimerThank you for taking the time to read my review, I hope this helped out with your decision on whether to make a purchase or not.Remember, this review is based off of opinion only. You may not think the same way as me towards something, but that's okay, because we are all human."

,Recommended,307340,15961091,"Posted: 22 May, 2015",all,RetroJaro,"This is a very simple shooter all done in clay. It really reminds me of the neverhood in that there's abstract shapes and everything is not super smooth. 5 weapon icons, including a 4 way shot. (Weak but can hit multiple enemies at once), rapid fire shot (my favorite. Doesn't have a scatter effect but does take down enemies quick), a wave (can hit multiple enemies at once but kinda weak.) a rocket (much better if you have the sidearms too. They scatter and it can be tough to hit enemies), and a laser. (Also passes through enemies. Pretty strong, but rare.) You can pick up two sidearms to triple your firing power of whatever weapon you have active, and there's a 2x score multiplier. You get additional ships fairly easily in game, but it's one hit and you're destroyed. This is not a bullethell shooter, and even if you've played games like tyrian 2000, you'll probably find this one on the fairly easy side.Pros:1: Very cool artstyle.2: I like some of the effects. Level 1 has a long train boss for you to destroy. Level 3 has a volcano that rains rocks and coins. Level 4 is a polluted city.3: The music. I can identify the level 1 music as a commodore 64 remix of Comic Bakery with a splash of Jurassic Park NES level 1 music.4: Picking up same colored powerup icons extends the time you can use the weapon.Cons:1: When you die if you have anything special like the sidearms, you lose them. This can make things like the bosses challenging when you're given sidearms and rockets to shoot the boss with.2: No real upgrade system to speak of, or even a in game shop of any kind. Once the time runs out, you lose your special weaponIt's worth picking up if it's on sale."

I played an incomplete bootleg of this as a kid many years ago, and it still holds its charm today. It might be short, but it has plenty of challenge and is still a fun game to fire up every once in a while.The gameplay is simple: You are a plane with a gun, and you need to shoot other aircraft that usually have guns. It is nevertheless surprisingly complex, with more little secrets than you might expect of a game like this. Doing well early on carries over into the later game and feels intensely satisfying, as it is much easier to continue doing well afterwards. Essentially, this encourages replay because it keeps getting better as you get better."

Gain score for a life, pass a stage for a credit (continue).There is no screen sweeper, and you cannot touch enemies. Co-op shares credit, btw.My rating: roughly 4/10Reasons of playing:-    Seeing that I used to play this and it is now lost, bought this on sale.My experience:-    Cleared the whole game on hard, continued a few times but I'm done with the game.-    Reminds me how Shooter and Bullet hell are different genres.-    I like Autogun. Bullet hell games influence.What I like:-    Art: musics, graphics, sounds, atmosphere.-    Increase point item value by shooting it.-    Special weapons can be kept on screen when there's no need to collect right away.What I don't like:-    Manual firing is much stronger than auto firing. Imagine rockets fired at machinegun rate.-    Difficulty. This is not about the game being too hard or easy, but somehow stage 2 seems to be the hardest and stage 3 the second, With all the blending background and hard-to-detect mini bullets.-    Enemies come from behind without sign. No problem for me, but this is a casual game.-    Stages don't end with just last enemy or boss defeated, but also a set amount of time passed. Such a waste of special weapons.-    You can select any stage to start after you've beaten it once. Meaning you can skip harder stages and still finish the game.-    Final score is affected by current score, credits left and not lives left.-    Past stages are replayable. -> Credits are grindable. -> Score are grindable-    Leaderboard. There is no need for it, seriously. Difficulty gives no bonus and they all share one leaderboard and score is grindable. The game is not that competitive, so this board is just a decoration.All in all:-    This game is not so bad as I liked it as a kid. But there's really nothing much for moderate (or higher) gamers to look forward to."

Without the powerups many places in the game are almost impossible to get through.- Using same sprites for enemies in the background, foreground and the playarea is just a horrible idea and this will come apparent on the minefield on the second world.This game actually made me angry and i can not recommend this to anyone."

The claymation graphics are great, the music fits the whole atmosphere of the game really well(as it should), and you can play with up to 3 people. Overall it's really a fantastic game.

,Recommended,307340,33935540,Posted: 31 July,all,Redbeard,"Platypus is a nice little claymation game in which you pilot a small green military jet, with the aim of shooting down hordes of alien spaceships that appear before you (and behind you, as the case may be).(I'm guessing that they are alien spaceships, but they could just be from a futuristic Earth civilisation. Who knows? Not me, that's for sure.)The game mechanics are not very much different from a wide range of similar games, but the claymation style gives it a sort of cuteness which is easy on the eye, being somewhat visually amusing.Whilst the game is simple in its concept, it gets harder as you level up.When you blow up some bigger enemy vessels you can collect the large stars they leave behind, which will give you better weapons.Or they might drop fruit (bananas, cherries, etc.), which you can collect for bonus points.In the higher levels you have to fight harder enemies: huge motherships, fixed gun emplacements, train-mounted guns, and more.Whilst you can fly right down to the ground and take no damage by doing so, you might be in for a surprise in a later level when you crash into a ground-level fuel tank.So, be careful with what you're doing.Platypus is not a spectacular game, but it's a bit of fun.With its claymation style, I imagine that it could be quite a good game for children.6/10."
