Players would take turns setting down the first four pieces in the center of the board. Because of this, either player could force the “parallel” starting configuration (White White Black Black), rather than the predetermined Othello starting configuration (White Black Black White).2- In Reversi, the game is over as soon as either player could not make a move. In Othello and this game, the player without a move simply passes, and the other player makes as many moves as needed before the first player can make a move again. The game is only over once neither player can make a move."

Cleared up my a fellow gamer here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReversiDespite the occasional crash - it is the game that I enjoyed playing as a kid.I am enjoying it now - despite the *complete* lack of people available to play multiplayer....! Not sure if thats a bug or I am the only person playing.It should be 3 or 4 dollars not 6 or 9.7/10

I've been playing Reversi/Othello for a long time, as well as have been researching board and card games, and I have never encountered a version that didn't start with four pieces in the center, and I've always found ""Reversi"" and ""Othello"" used interchangeably.  But games like this are old and acquire many rules over time.  Who can really say, and does it really matter that much?Now, as for the game itself, don't buy it unless it's on a pretty heavy sale.  I waited until it fell down to about $3, and had I paid a dime more than that I'd have been pretty upset.  While functional it lacks polish.  Only two varieties of pieces, no varieties of boards or backgrounds.  The background music is annoying with no other options.  The sound effects are grating.  Seems like small stuff, but they are all things that should be present for $10 whole wing-wangs.  In 3-D mode the pieces flip over in a very satisfying way, but if you make a large capture the computer goes immediately after while your pieces are still flipping.  And if you make a large capture, and the computer makes a large capture, your first pieces could be flipping back before your captured pieces are finished turning over.  I find it to be incredibly annoying.All of these seems like small complaints and they are, but to be charging $10 I'd expect a lot more.  I'd expect a lot more especially when you can just google ""Reversi"" or ""Othello"" and find a low tech flash version on a website and play for free.  So save your $10 and put it towards a real Othello/Reversi board you can buy at any Toys'R'us."

The AI often say ""the AI has no moves, its your turn again"" - however there is a lot of moves for the AI to do. The game crashes a lot on my Mac (mid-game) and I have not one single time succeed to play against another player (ranked). Money back please!!!"

It wasn't my cup of tea, to say the least.The AI is great and actually offers a challenge, or it could be that I was so bad that even the low level AI's were better than me. Regardless, if you can't play against people online for some reason, the computer seems to be plenty good enough to challenge you. It also allows you to play versus your friend through couch co op, it looks like.Overall, this game is smooth and worth your time, if you like reversi/othello to begin with. I didn't enjoy it but that's not the developer's fault or anything so don't blame him. Also, the developer was responding to just about every thread in the discussion forum so that is pretty phenomenal.Get this game if you like reversi/othello and you won't be disappointed. Promise."

Something we would sit around, play, and talk about random stuff.  Some of my fondest memories are around this game.  If you love this type of game, its great.  It has Player vs Computer, Local Multiplayer, and Online Multiplayer.  I love it."

People who want to challenge and destroy their minds puzzling over which tile to flip next will love this game.A word of warning: The AI is difficult to beat but not impossible.Another word of warning: This is NOTHING like chess.A++++++++++++"

Great job. I bought this game and its worth it."

The first few times I played it, I wasn't sure what was going on - I put down my piece and flip over the other color, right? But there was obviously more to it than that, as I was winning - or losing - with no rhyme nor reason. Eventually, I started to get an idea of how to play and it became more fun. The music is great, so that certainly makes it more pleasant."

In fact, I can see many possibilities for the computer to play. It seems like a bug.Also, the user interface could be much more compact; so much space wasted inside the window.And it's not possible to create a desktop shortcut from Steam on OSX.Disappointing."

It's nowhere near as good or as fun as Freeverse Software's late, lamented REVERSI: THE ECLIPSE, which was everything that this game is not in terms of design and playability and entertainment value. But -- that game is defunct, and this is the only game of its type (that I'm aware of) now available to me... so I guess for the price I can't complain. I'm basically glad to have it, it's nice to have a game or two in the collection that you can play QUICKLY without a big time involvement."

I've had good fun playing friends online across the country aside from the occasional crash. UI is really ugly and is only servicable.
