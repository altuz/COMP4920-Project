How come I've never told you that after the excellent Ben Jordan series, Grundislav came back with another universe?A Golden Wake puts you in the shoes of a young man, trying his luck during the '20 in Florida, in the real estate market, under Georges Merrick and during his apogee before falling into another universe.It's a point-&-click adventure, reminiscent of the age of pixelated games, with AGS engine. But here, you have some twists: if you want to be the perfect guy (in other words, unlock achievements), you have to convince people to listen to you and to comply to your requests. If not, well, it's up to you to find another way around. Some puzzles are also included. As far as I know, I enjoyed the plot.Surrounded by characters that really existed, if you activate comments, you'll have some pieces of history, making it also a learning game for everyone interested in that matter. Yeah, it's in English but who cares? You can have subtitles, no voice acting, etc.. And the voice acting is very good anyway.The soundtrack is really fitting the '20. Dam dam dam dam dam damdam.... ups, sorry, I was singing some charleston.I can only recommend it. Not because I love Grundislav's style since Ben Jordan (ah Ben, Simon, Alice, Percival....) - they're free, people, the original games or the deluxe edition for the two first adventures. But because it's a very enjoyable game. Very very enjoyable game.Do yourself a favor. Buy A Golden Wake, buy the Blackwell series, download the Ben Jordan series and the Chzo Mythose quadrilogy. You'll understand why they are considered as gems."

Unless the topic of the 1920s Florida land boom heavily interests you, stay far far away from this one. Nearly an hour into this game, I found myself bored to tears by:1) the extremely dry way the topic was presented;2) nothing exciting happening;3) the lack of drama/mystery;4) the complete lack of connection to the game's lead and any of its other characters.I don't usually last this long in such a monotonous game (I view my time as being very precious and if a game doesn't manage to hook me within the first 15 minutes of play, into the trash it goes); the reason I did so here was because I've liked many Wadjet Eye games so far, and hoped this one would be similar in style, pacing and drama. Well, it wasn't.The low-res graphics suck.I'm playing on a 1920 x 1080 screen and they look extremely murky and overly stretched out. People and other small objects look like blobs of paint.Plays more like a visual novel.It may seem like a ""game"", but for much of what happens (up till the point I stopped playing), I found myself merely executing commands the game wanted me to. For instance, at the start of the game, youmustgo in and talk to your boss, then check the leads chart, then sit at your table, then wait for your coworkers to cheat you out of your job... YEAH.Cheat you out of your job?!you say? Yes. And you can see the trick they're pulling on you coming from a mile away,yetyou stillhave tofollow through with it and be cheated, just because the game doesn't give you any other option.So basically, your character is just like a puppet following ""orders"" from the game.No real choice.See above point.So this game is not recommend by any measure. I couldn't find even a single good thing to say about it. Wouldn't touch it even if it were free."

But a lot of work went into this game, and it shows. The story got me hooked, but it's the little touches that got me excited.THE PUZZLES MAKE SENSE? Want to frighten something? Use a gun. Want to break something? Use a hammer. Want to steal a part? Distract the guard by having someone else talk to him, and use a wrench.

I really wanted to like this, because I've loved every other game from Wadjet Eye so far, but I really had a tough time getting into this one.  I did finish it, more due to the completionist in me, but also in hopes that it would get better.  Parts of it near the end did improve a little, but overall, the game felt very disjointed, and involved a LOT of ""To do this, first you have to get this person to do that, but to do THAT, you have to get these three items"", rinse and repeat.  A lot of seemingly-arbitrary tasks ahead of you, and not much in the way of an overarching storyline to tie it all together, other than Alfie (the main character) ""trying to make it big"" and restore his family's name.  That's about it as far as plot.I looked up reviews to see if I was missing something, and a lot of reviewers said how they really identified with the main character, Alfie Banks, but I honestly felt he was pretty bland... a fairly generic stereotype of a 1920's real estate agent.The one thing I did like about the game is that it's based on the real ""history"" (with some artistic liberties taken, of course) of Coral Gables, FL.  Many of the main characters have real life counterparts, with the exception of Alfie.  But other than that, with a plot that couldn't figure out which way it was going and never really tied together, subpar voice acting, a step back in the way of retro-styled graphics that didn't just feel ""retro-styled"" but more like it actually was made years ago (and not in a good way)... I just wasn't a big fan of the game.  Not awful, but not that good.  A big disappointment compared to Wadjet Eye's other fantastic productions."

They consistently put out adventure games that are at least very good and polished.  By this point, many fans will be very familiar with WadjetEye's high quality music, voice acting, and charming and beautiful graphics.Unfortunately, A Golden Wake is something of a low point.  The voice acting and music are still consistent, but the story and characters lack flair and fail to hold much interest.  The game isn't horrible, but it suffers in comparison with other productions by the company.  The setting is interesting, as is the basic premise of following a forgotten, faux-historical character as he lives through real historical events.  The problem is that all of this isn't taken advantage of in such a way that makes for an enjoyable or moving gaming experience.  It's all just kind of ""blah.""A lover of Wadjeteye might still want to try A Golden Wake.  To everyone else, I would recommend the vast majority of WadjetEye games over this one.

It took me just 3 hours to finish it and I never got stuck. It says in my profile that I've played 6 hours but when I first got the game last night I was drinking and forgot to save the game at the end of the night so today I had to play through once again all my previous work from last night.At any given time in the game you only have 2 or 3 items in your inventory and it's always very obvious where to use them.Verdict: Nice game but way too easy for experienced adventure gamers. I will say I recommend it but actually I only recommend it to those who are new to the genre or under the age of 10 or both.

It has most of the things I'd want from a point and click adventure: nice (though retro) graphics, excellently executed score, decent voice actors and sensible (but a touch too easy) puzzles.The major letdown is the uninteresting plot. You start out as a young enthusiastic estate agent. The game follows  him through several years and he never really gets more interesting. The ending is hugely anticlimactic.In short, give it a go if (like me) you are a bit of a point and click addict and can't find a more interesting game to pass the time."

The game's story intertwines through the life story of a character who starts off feeling like he can take over the world and then realises that life doesn't always go to plan no matter how much you try to achieve.  The puzzles are well thought out, and it even has a hint option for the more casual adventurers.  Fantastic voice acting, wonderful animations and an engaging story.

It's highly recommend to play with developer commentary on, if only to get more background history. It will include a few spoilers, but I don't see that is a problem (see below), and will also earn you an extra achievement.The pixelated graphics do a surprisingly good job at capturing the atmosphere, and the voice acting is usually good enough to keep it believable.Unfortunately the game is very boring.The story is utterly uninteresting and progresses incredibly slowly. The plot twists lack any real excitement -- this is why I don't think commentary spoilers would affect your enjoyment). Also, the gameplay is dreary. Fans of point-and-click adventures would find the puzzles to be trivial. There are a few innovative mechanics, such as persuading people to do things via conversation, and two chase scenes, but they are poorly exectued and more annoying than fun.If you're a history buff and are excited by the subject matter of this game, you might be better off treating it as a visual novel and using a walkthrough to just race through the insipid gameplay. Even then, I imagine you'll find it agonizingly slow.﻿Francisco Gonzalez has exceptional talent and dedication. I hope that in the future he teams up with a developer who knows more about how to make games fun. His passion was wasted here.I would also like to thank the developer for supporting Linux."

I had expected more of a noir-ish detective adventure, since that is such a common theme in modern graphic adventures, but instead you get to spend a few years as a somewhat douchey real estate agent who finds himself thrust into what turns out to be an fascinating slice of real-life American history. Being a modern adventure, the puzzles aren't obtuse and are essentially just a way to break up the story a bit, but because the story and dialog are so well-done, it doesn't matter. I think this is the first game i have ever played where i paused to go read Wikipedia in the middle because i wanted to find out how much of it was real. (Warning: reading Wikipedia does spoil the plot.) A brief but wonderful diversion. The dialog puzzles remind me a lot of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, which is a very good thing."

The part in the free demo was picked perfectly, as it is the best part of the game (wich is why i gave it a shot).Things which really made me angry:- Poor voice acting, especially Merrick (in my opinion). The main character speaks good though.- Very (very) poor and few ""riddles""- The most interesting feature are the persuasion games, however it doesn´t matter if you persuade somebody or not- You are sometimes given different options of answers in  dialogues, this answers however only influence the following sentence. --> it doesn´t matter what you answer- playing the game is like beeing in a prison, everything is strict, sturdy and planned. It doesn´t matter how you play the game, no effect on the outcome. no replay value.- the time span covers 20 years or so, but many backscreens are just recycled. (for example there is a hotel scene and there are some dancers dancing. A hurricane destroys the city, several years pass by and what goes on in the hotel when you visit it again? The same dancers are doomed and dance all the time into eternity..) even the text when you click on recycled things stays the same for ever.."

The visuals and the music match the style of the time and really get the player in the mood and mindset to explore the world of the game.  I REALLY liked that this was just ""the story of a guy"", so to speak...nothing flashy, or world-saving, just a man living his life and what he does and goes through in a particularly interesting time period.  The side-characters were fascinating in their own right, and the ending biographies really gave a good sense of closure on a lot of faces who I had become fond of.That being said, although I loved many of the characters in the game, I didn't find the protagonist particularly engaging.  I really liked the concept that he was an imperfect man living an imperfect life, but in practice I found him to be fairly two-dimensional and his motivations a little perplexing at times (ie.I understood that he wanted to leave the mob after his actions led to a death, but his decision to kill Fatty seemed to come completely out of left field).

Puzzles were easy, and the characters were okay at best. *SPOILER* Alfie's motivation to betray his boss was really lame, and sudden even for the player.Just go play Ben Jordan paranormal investigator its basically that without the paranormal. Made by the same guy and it's free and there are like 10 games.Game wasn't worth 15 bucks, maybe 1-5.Pick it up when it's 80% off."

I'm a fan of the Blackwell games so I have been picking up other games by Wadjet Eye and I have enjoyed The Shivah, Gemini Rue, Resonance and Primordia. A Golden Wake just sucks, it's boring and the characters are either flat or not likeable. I was really disappointed by this game."

They did a really nice job of bringing the era to life as well as showing the mindset that people had back then. Would definitely recommend and will absolutely be playing it through again to see if I missed anything. (As well as to turn on the bonus feature!)"

The flimsy characters don't hold much water either.  It's an easy enough game to blow through, as the puzzles are flimsy but logical and there's not much meat to it, but retro adventure game fans, particularly those who enjoyed Lara Bow, will find enough here to keep them mildly entertained.  Don't expect much more, though."

Like other Wadjet Eye games, A Golden Wake focuses on story, puzzles, pointing and clicking in the style of Monkey Island, and retro style pixel art.You play as Alfie Banks during the Florida Land Boom of the 1920s. You are a talented real estate agent looking to reach the top while dealing with bootleggers, politicians and shady salesmen. I really enjoyed the story and would not hesitate to say it's the most impressive aspect of the game. It was refreshing to play this type of story and it's the kind of plot that demonstrates the appeal of adventure games.Unfortunately the game just isn't difficult enough. There is a bit of backtracking and most puzzles are quite obvious. A more seasoned adventure fan will blast through this game in about 4 hours. However, I didn't even mind. I enjoyed the dialoue, the plot and the use of mini persuasion style games. I was interested, and despite only having to think about 1 puzzle in particular, I wanted to play until the end with no hesitation.A Golden Wake is not very challenging, but offers a good story and is set in an interesting period in history. Any modern point and click game is a blessing and I have no problem recommending this game to veterans of the genre. Do not expect any puzzles to make you pull your hair out, but expect a fresh scenario and setting with a few hours well spent afterwards.  Not as great as Primordia or Resonance, but well worth your time."

There are many locations. Puzzles are also good but the gameplay is of course linear, because this is a story-centric game. One of the best Wadjeteye games."

I love the graphical style and the gameplay both.This game is infuriatingly not good. It's poorly written and full of fake choices. It pretends that you can have an effect on the story, but you definitely can't. Classic Bioware-style fake choice.It's not as bad as some titles out there. It's not trash, and it does have its high points. The overall vibe of the game is very nice and the music is lovely. The graphics are bad but classy.It's really the game itself that will leave you disappointed. You have to be quite stupid to not be offended by the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor plot. It's all very forced and simplistic, when it could easily not be. It seems to want to be a serious story, but it's so badly written that you end up feeling queasy about it."

The first half of the game is actually quite brilliant, the storyline feels fresh with interesting characters and seamless puzzles. The game starts dragging at that point though, the last third feels uninspired and somewhat boring and it starts to dawn on you that the game is about some realestate agent in florida a century ago. I never found this premise particularly exciting, but the game has to tie up with that.The pixelsarts and voiceovers are very good, so if you are into retro-adventuregames (or REALLY dig stories about realestate agents) you owe it to yourself to give this one a spin. Others probably want to look elsewhere."

It was a no brainer for me! The art style, music, voice acting are great.However, I have noticed that sometimes when I click to investigate something, the infomation box disappers very quickly. Meaning I have to save, quit and start again. Sadly reloading the safe does nothing, you have to quit out completely."
