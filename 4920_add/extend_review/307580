Technobabylon is on par, if not surpasses classic point'n'clicks, like Westwood's, Sierra's and Lucas Arts ones.It is almost a crime how little this game sold on Steam, and it clearly needs more publicity. (So I feel I should at least write this review, dammit)First things first, it catches what it takes something to be cyberpunk pretty well.It also abides the number one cyberpunk rule - every character is involved for their own reasons and is trying to resolve their own problems. Their actions overlap, interests conflict, and thus, the story is born.Moreover, dialogues are also put together very well, it really shows.When talking / describing a situation, characters are trying to cover all possible critique coming from player and explain their reasoning, so there will be no (or very little) unanswered ""Why didn't you do %that% instead?"" questions on your behalf.Characters also have distinct personalities, and they are not in a hurry to just dump all information from character sheet on you, you need to ask questions (or not, just like with people around in ""meatspace"")The pacing of game also matches a pace you expect from events of the story, so there is no dissonances on this part.Plot twists: KOJIMA / 10That's good writing for you.As for gameplay aspects, like in every good point'n'click game, you are not so much ""solving puzzles"", as ""managing situations"", and there is often more than one way to resolve your problems (It is mirrored by achievements, which is nice)Overall, it's a must have.Technocrat Games clearly should be more proud of their creation and make better publicity for Technobabylon and future games.P.S.

,Recommended,307580,22855324,"Posted: 7 May, 2016",all,Mr. Hugh Mannity,"It seems as if, nowadays, adventure games straddle one of two extremes. They are either interactive works of fiction that don’t offer much in the way of traditional challenge, or they are traditionally difficult point-and-click games with traditionally broken logic. Games that combine a rich story and world building without feeling like a DVR simulator are somewhat rare. Being one of those rare titles is what makes Technocrat Games’s Technobabylon a remarkable experience. First began life as a freeware title, Technobabylon benefits from better production values (evident in the voice acting), revamped and stylistic pixel visuals, and a well assembled adventure experience thanks to the involvement of Wadjet Eye.A bit of backgroundTechnobabylon takes place in a sci-fi setting that is not to dissimilar to what what we’ve seen in adventure video games and other forms of media and entertainment. As you sink into the premise, setting and characters of Technobabylon, its influences become apparent in its nuances. Technobabylon will remind you of classic movies Blade Runner, cult classic games like Policenauts, iconic anime/manga like Ghost in the Shell and even newer anime like Psycho Pass.In a city called Newton, a place where science has risen above ethics and morals, and everyone plays god with free-form genetic engineering. Advances in computing power have led to massive advancements in AI, that mostly put to use for monitoring and controlling citizens. Social media and inter-web interaction has gone up a few notches, with the virtual-reality medium called Trance giving people a platform to interact in a virtual world and not deal with the real world responsibilities. Genetic engineering has made stunning advances as well – when an organic nanomachines called ""wetware"" are invented for many different purposes. Such freedoms and technological progress come at a price, however, when it created a generation of addicts (known as “thralls”) who have no jobs and spend most of their time in ""trance"", or when a genetically engineered children with explosive bones can be made as a suicide bomber.The protagonistsMeet Regis, He’s the typical “too-old-for-this"" cop, and boy is he too old for this. If Regis could wear a Rage Against the Machine shirt to work, he would. Assuming people remember Rage Against the Machine in post-nuclear 2087. Surveillance cameras, computers, phones, cyborg-style implants—Regis hates the whole lot, and most of all he hates the city’s overzealous artificial intelligence, Central.Then there's Lao, an ordinary girl with her cheerfulness and spark keeps her partner Regis’ cynical doom-and-gloom attitude at bay for most of the game and brightens up the atmosphere considerably. In a game that has such a dark plot with so many terrible things happening, Max’s character provides the perfect balance to the mix, adding the sense of hope the story so desperately needs.And finally Latha. She brings the game its biggest breath of fresh air, as she is able to enter the Trance. From here, she can interact with other users and even AI systems she encounters, displaying them through humanistic avatars complete with unique personalities. Here, the game flexes its creative muscles at not only providing unique gameplay, but also at delivering dialogue with wit and humor as well.The way it shuttles you between these three viewpoints is probably one of my favorite aspect of the game. It feels like we learn a lot about the world, thanks to our split perspective.Puzzles n' stuffSpeaking of puzzles, we can agree that the most important part of any puzzle-based games is the presentation of the puzzles themselves, and this is where Technobabylon really delivers. Not every puzzle has the same wealth of approaches, but in general things adhere to each character’s skills—low-fi investigation from Regis, high-tech hacking from Latha, and a bit of both from Lao. It’s a clever conceit that helps make each character feel functionally distinct even within the limited mechanics of a point-and-click adventure game. Whether its remotely piloting drones, manipulating AI personalities, or even solving how to enter through a locked doorway, Technobabylon makes figuring out how to get to the next destination an enjoyable experience. Visually, Tecnobabylon carries a style akin to the DOS adventure game classics from yesteryear, and the pixelated graphics are put to good use to create some detailed environments and character sprites. Neon colors/lighting mixes nicely with the darker contrast and undertones to create an artistically charged setting. Except for the character portraits that pop up in conversations, the game looks like an early 1990s LucasArts adventure game.Some minor complaintsDespite the overall positive experience, the playthrough wasn’t without its own set of problems. There are moments when I got confused about what the objects are or how they function, as it is often unclear without clicking on them to get a text description. The low fidelity visuals also contribute to the problem of not always knowing what you can grab from the environment and what you can manipulate. It is easy to miss out on a drawer or a wrench since so many useable items blend into the background. In addition to that, some of the voice acting – in particular that of Regis – was a little too monotone, which made even the more dramatic scenes a little less moving. Not to mention that Trance is somewhat underutilized too. We get glimpses of Trance’s potential, especially the part where Latha is constantly swapping between the virtual and physical worlds to solve puzzles. But in general the game doesn’t do enough with a world that has literally zero rules.Bottom lineHonestly, I feel like I can write an essay or two about this game. Like drawing some comparison between Central (Newton's overzealous artificial intelligence) and The Sibyl system from Psycho Pass, whether the escapism provided by Trance a blessing in a world gone to hell, or is it merely enabling people to give up on the real world and many other topics to cover. But surely if you managed to make it this far, you want to see my thought about it. While there is no shortage of choice when it comes to adventure games — especially on Steam — Technobabylon is not just another face in the crowd. It doesn’t make you feel you are just a passenger along for the ride, nor does it make you feel like you need to be a mind reader to figure out how the developers want you to solve a puzzle. A little fix might have made game more enjoyable in a couple of ways, but the game is still a very easy one to recommend, especially since it's only 15 bucks."

I found this game easier to dive into compared to Gemini Rue and Resonance.Pros- Well-written futuristic sci-fi story that touches on artificial intelligence and virtual reality.- Easy to understand inventory system.- Decent voice acting and music.- Pushes the Adventure Game Studio engine to its limits. Nice animations and artwork all around.- Multiple solutions to some puzzles, a few with Steam achievements, which increases replayability.Cons- Wish it supported a higher resolution."

The gameplay is also quite good with puzzles that are, for the most part, logical and that make sense in the context of the area you're in.The few things that can be criticized are a few dialogues where voice actors seemed to lack the appropriate emtion while delivering their line and some puzzles that require you to make sense of how some technologies work in the game world like what can be linked to/ hacked. It generally can be solved with some trial and error using the items/ software available though.I can absolutely recommend Technobabylon to anyone interested in the genre, anyone wanting a deep story and/ or anyone who loves cyberpunk settings: it's truly a gem and everyone from the aforementioned audiences should play through it. If you're not convinced you can also try the Demo to see how the first two scenes how the game work."
,Recommended,307580,16747704,"Posted: 27 June, 2015",all,TheManko,"I’ve been on an adventure game bender recently, playing all the Blackwell games, Primordia, and Dreamfall Chapters. Of them all, Technobabylon was easily the most enjoyable. The problems I had with the game feel minor, like some voice actors overacting, or how the text is written when you examine objects. These issues were blotted out by the mysteries, the music, the audio design, and puzzles with multiple solutions. I just loved “being in the world”, to whatever extent that’s possible in a point-and-click. It was a nice place to be in, even before the first line of the game was spoken. I saw it, I heard it, and I knew I liked it. That propelled me through the opening of the game until the story kicked off in proper and hooked me completely.Compared to Primordia, Technobabylon’s story lacks depth. It goes for a less subtle and more action heavy approach. More thrills, more instant gratification, and no confusion. This approach works, as it succeeds in actually being thrilling, and makes it hard to put down. Because of this, I find Technobabylon easy to recommend. It’s unlikely anyone is going to be bored by it. It’s fairly long for a point-and-click adventure, but the superb pacing makes it feel half its length. If you haven’t played an adventure game in a while, this is the one I recommend above all others if you want a reminder of what this genre can do."

The point-and-click part is pretty OK, meaning the objects are rarely hard to find. The game is pretty light in moon logic (""twisted logic that seems tailor-made to frustrates you"" -urbandictionary.com)and I only got stuck really badly a few times. Even if it looks dated, this is a modern game with good artwork, story, and some interesting characters.Rating: I for one welcome our new AI overlord!*Editors' Pick* x1http://pixelloot.com"
,Recommended,307580,26628059,"Posted: 16 November, 2016",all,it's💀shoepacabra,"Cyberpunk went on the decline when it became a series of tropes and not a speculative framework. Too much of it became dressed-up from the 1980s, when the internet itself was beyond the awareness or comprehension of most people.Technobabylon doesn't do that. It *gets* cyberpunk and develops it with an understanding of existing technology, developments on the cusp of existence, and the way states and capital shape how that technology affects our lives. Rather than trying to spin virtual reality as some barely imagined new concept like William Gibson never existed, Technobabylon looks at biotech, AI development, and automation to flesh out a world that feels incredibly plausible and compelling.Puzzle systems are never insanely ""out there,"" but there are fun applications of some mechanics. The AI Splitter that lets you dismantle and rebuild AI minds with different pieces of each other really stands out as one of the more fun ones. And a few obnoxious pixel-hunts notwithstanding, puzzles in Technobabylon feel largely fair and coherent.On the whole this is one of the best titles Wadjet Eye has published to date. Absoltely worth a go for cyberpunk fans and adventure gamers alike."

The writing is really good, the soundtrack fits perfectly and the execution is spot on. Technically it's your typical Wadjet Eye Point&Click Adventure (including the limitations of the Adventure Studio engine) but in a Cyberpunk setting. The puzzles that need to be solved to progress the story aren't artificial and make perfect sense. Also props for investing in a sheer endless amount of non-important ""wrong number"" responses."

That setting bears many details which you can find out about in dialogues or news feeds and so makes for a complete world.The story is really well written and so are the characters. They have personality, a past and thus motivations.All conversations are actually spoken.

Production value is very high, comparable to Resonance and the final game in the Blackwell series. Story is gripping and interesting all the way through. Puzzles are nearly as tough as those in Resonance, including a few that require some action skill. Game length is pretty decent - plenty of optional dialogue, and lots of different scenes. The only Wadjet Eye game that's longer is Resonance.When it comes to character chemistry, your mileage may vary. The voice acting direction feels pretty loose - as if the majority of it was intended for a Blackwell game. The intensity and focus of character from Gemini Rue is not present here, unfortunately.One good thing about the story is that there's no cartoony bad guys. Each of them has a realistic motivation. No multiple endings like Resonance though."

This may not be the strongest thing they have produced, but it still has a number of good ideas.There are a bunch of high level sci fi concepts put into the characters and set pieces. To mention any of them would take that discovery away from you so I won't really say too much, just suffice that it exists and it's fun to see what Technocrat came up with.The actual writing is passable, but not super strong. The star here is really the sci fi ideas, not the characters themselves. I don't even want to criticise too much because it would require spoilers.The actual puzzles are a mix of a bunch of different ideas too, and sometimes there are some minor UI issues as a result. Often it feels more like trying to understand how the game functions more than solving actual puzzles. But they work more often than not.Overall a solid adventure game, even more so if you are a sci-fi nerd. It's also surprisingly long."

,Recommended,307580,25125683,"Posted: 24 August, 2016",all,Baphomet,"The Wadjet Eye legacy continues with yet another interesting addition to their innovative point and click adventure game lineup: Technobabylon. Set in a dystopian future (they sure do love that aesthetic) of quarreling nation-states with drastically different governments, you play a pair of detectives, and an unlikely accomplice, in a futuristic city known as Newton. The city is under threat by a mysterious character known as the mindjacker who steals peoples’ minds for unknown reasons and you are tasked with bringing him to justice.Typical for Wadjet Eye, this game offers a new interactive system to spice things up called ‘wetware’, wherein the user can connect wirelessly with people or systems allowing the player to solve puzzles via interactions in an abstract parallel world known as the Trance (e.g. cyberspace). Eventually you also gain the ability to manipulate artificial intelligence entities, called synths, through special programs that control their personalities.The environments in Technobabylon are much more constrained than those in other adventure games by this studio which has a slight side effect of making a good number of the puzzles easier to solve since you don’t have as many rooms to cycle through and consequently less items to interact with as well. Seasoned PnC adventure game veterans might be turned off a bit by this aspect but I found that the story and consequence system (as well as the alternate ending) make up for it. The game is also very dialogue heavy but the majority of it is well-spent and you will find yourself learning more about characters and the world surrounding them instead of feeling like you’re wasting your time.In an era where AAA studios are pumping out non-stop schlock, it’s refreshing to see a title like Technobabylon that bucks the trend and delivers a great experience at the same time. It’s definitely worth the $15 and even more of a steal if you manage to catch it on sale."

Technobabylon has the quality that is to be expected of Wadjet Eye Games and is perhaps a contender for their best game at the time of writing.Technobabylon takes place in a dystopian future where genetic engineering is common and many people use ""Trance"" instead of interacting with other people normally.  An AI named Central powers the city and the CEL police keep tabs on just about everyone and everything.  As usual with Wadjet Eye Games, the story is high quality and I do seriously hope it continues in a future sequel.Developer Technocrat has pushed the somewhat divisive AGS engine further than I thought it could go; there are many sections involving people connecting to electronic devices and some of the best puzzles take place in this state.  Whether it is just using these devices to obtain download attachments or solving far more complex puzzles, Technobabylon stands out when compared to adventure games using simpler mechanics.  I wasn't expecting some of the puzzles and a few genuinely had me stumped for a while.  So unlike many adventure games, this isn't just a great story based experience, there's challenge here and it's more challenging than most Wadjet Eye Games.Wadjet Eye Games enjoy giving you control over numerous characters and I found that this could lead to some confusion as how to progress.  I liked that this game rarely had any of these moments and when you were able to switch between characters, it would always be in aid of solving a puzzle together.  It's these design choices that make Technobabylon a bit easier to swallow than a game like Resonance.There's not a lot else to say, if you are really into Wadjet Eye Games, then you will already have your eye on this.  Fans of Gemini Rue, Shardlight and Resonance will eat this up.  A polished point and click game in that old-school style and a creative science fiction story that deserves some sequels."

The solitions to the puzzles require a bit more emersion than is allowed by this style of game, however hints are usually not far off. Very much a game where you really have to read between the lines if you want help, although some are outright unfair (found myself looking at the walkthrough and uttering outloud ""What the hell!""). I was more of a Normaility fan when point and clicks came to my door 1st of all, but this has to be one of the best adventure games I've ever played, very much sticking to the ""3 is a crowd"" style of storytelling. Plenty of game design tropes rolling around in this one, but defines itself away from any other type of game like a finely composed score... old, new and beutiful, all at the same time. Many minds made this game, many styles approched it, they found a way to compromise and create a consistant gaming narrative, by giving everything a space in its own world that is delibratly jenky and seemless at the same time.

The plot isn'tcompletelyoriginal - once you look at it closer, you'll notice strong inspirations from Beneath A Steel Sky and Neuromancer, including a few of the puzzles - but it holds its own without feeling derivative.I did have a few gripes with the game: in particular, some of the lines recorded for Max sounded very differently from the rest and the pixel-art style is less than perfect on a few occasions - seeing ""half pixel"" lines was kind of jarring, and there's a loose plot thread - unfortunately, one rather relevant to the plot (we never really find out whyboth cloneswere created). The game includes an autosave on the start of each chapter, which turned out quite handy in when I ended up in what's probably the only dead-end situation in the game (no way to progress without interacting with an item you can't backtrack towhen you climb outside the airship).The limited amount of objects you can interact with in the game's locations has both upsides and downsides - in the 90's adventure games, they often provided a lot of colorful, sometimes humorous, exposition on the game's plot and setting, but from a design perspective, less items for the player to work with means less red herrings (there are a few, such asthe toilet cleaner)In a nice touch, not all of Technobabylon's puzzles are linear: in several chapters there's more than one solution, and the game rewards you with achievements for discovering each. While they do not alter the course of the game's plot (apart from one in the final chapter), later chapters sometimes contain callbacks to the choices you made earlier.Over all, the game is notperfectbut thoroughly enjoyable regardless - if you buy it, you won't regret that decision."

I found it very interesting & exciting!The puzzles were of a satisfying difficulty. There was a good balance of ""flow"" & ""resistance"" in regard to game progression (for me, personally).What I mean by this is that puzzle difficulty allowed for smoother progression at some times, and at other times I felt I was required to think a bit harder before I could proceed (without doing my head in  though).So I was very pleasantly surprised by how the developer team pulled this off!I figured out most on my own, but did need to cheat about 2 times (hey!, that's not too bad!).This game contains different fun elements:- beautiful character design & environment + fitting music- natural voice acting (although the way it was scripted made some reactions seem over-the-top)- well written dialogue (made sense)- multiple & meaningful character introductions- intuitive & original puzzles (with some exceptions, but definitely doable)- flashbacks- choice & consequence- virtual reality & AI theme- ethnical diversity- taboo & shocking detailsThere's a total of 3 main characters (which are each playable at some point, and even interchangeably so near the end, so as to have them act as a team - very fun!).Just wished they had implemented that possibility sooner!I pretty much loved everything about this game :).

Fortunately, Technobabylon doesn't disappoint.The game pulls you into a great story through strong and relatable characters with clear motivations that you can get behind.  It dangles the mystery like a carrot on a stick, but gives you enough payoffs to keep you going.  The real star, however, is the amazing sense of world-building and atmosphere.  Technobabylon builds an incredibly believable world that builds off of our current technological and societal trajectory and takes it in some very scary directions.  Its atmosphere and soundtrack are also wonderful, creating a completely cohesive and immersive world.The interactions between the characters are well done, and there are some standout supporting characters that are a real hoot.  The dialogue can get VERY expositional at times, especially when the plot twists start cropping up near the end, but overall the dialogue is very snappy and well done.The gameplay is solid, using great puzzles and exploration that make sense but are still challenging.  It doesn't fall into the normal nonsensical adventure game puzzle tropes, which I'm very thankful for.  You can usually piece together what you need to do from your surroundings and resources, but you still feel smart for figuring it out.  There are a couple of times when what you're supposed to be doing isn't made clear (as in, what your objective is or why you're somewhere in the first place), but these points were few and far between.I picked this game up, and couldn't put it down until 9 hours later.

The game focuses on three people living in a futuristic city run by a central computer. There's Charles Regis, an agent of CEL, which acts as a police force within the city, his partner Max Lao, and trance addict/hacker Latha Sesame. The three become entangled in an intricate plot involving part secrets, intricate histories, and unique technologies. The game separates itself from typical sci-fi by giving it's technology a bizzare form of organic technology, ala David Cronenberg, in which computers come from an organic source. And while the story may have an immense amount of dizzying technical detail, what truly separates it is the way in which it is played. Yes, it adheres to much of the usual point-click style, but it breaks this up by including some interesting game elements and making use of it's technological setting. At certain points, you'll control drones, be able to play minigames, and access a network hub. Things are kept fresh by giving you different kinds of environments to play in and different tools to use. All the characters are fairly well developed, though they aren't necessarily all that original. But the story feels somewhat fresh, thanks to it's unique technology, and it makes the central mystery interesting.

The most striking thing about the game is that it does a far better job at building a fascinating science fiction world than most AAA productions; in this aspect it more closely approaches a good novel than a game, bringing to mind great cyberpunk authors like Rudy Rucker or William Gibson, while at the same time maintaining its own creative identity.  Food, sports, cyberspace and IRL addictions, crime, criminal justice, politics -- it's all handled in an unobtrusive and intriguing way that draws the player deeply in.  The puzzles, which are all of about medium difficulty, all make sense in the context of this world and its tech, coming across more as outgrowth than obligatory tack-on.  It would be a shame for Technocrat's painstakingly crafted milieu to go to waste, and fortunately, there are indications, both inTechnobabylon's narrative and in the developer commentary, that a sequel may be in the works.There are a few questions that I would like answered about the mostly *very* impressive story (especially the import of a certain apartment bombing) but these gaps don't trip up the plot for me in the least; some of these can be left for the sequel I suppose, while the remainder can be left to player interpretation without strain on narrative continuity.  The voice acting, as in all Wadjet Eye productions, varies from actor to actor.  It is never bad, but never perfectly professional; it puts me in the mind of an obviously talented community theater troupe rather than a stable of career voice actors, and actually intensifies the hip ""indie"" vibe of the whole production.  I did encounter one minor bug in the game -- a wrench that I could not yank out of a gear because a partition blocked its hotspot -- but it only set me back about about a minute of playtime.(There were many awesomely odd little incidents that really helped me suspend my disbelief.  For example:  in a scummy VR-hosting dive, the player character must pry off a layer of crusted old wetware -- signal-broadcasting, nanomachine-rich goop that people smear on devices to interface their own internal wiring to those systems -- before she can apply her own and access a machine.  It's visceral details like this that make all the difference!)"

Making decisions is a a matter of character and philsophy, both of which this game portrays very well. In fact, in the second category the game reminds me of Deus Ex, discussing the morality of what the future brings.Plot holes are sparse, the kind where I only noticed them when reading a review afterward. All choices are well presented without making it too obnoxious you're making a game altering choice, although the fact that Steam acheivements pop up for picking a certain path often make it a bit too obvious you just did so. The price is very, very reasonable, considering this is ~8 hours of game. Poor in game animation but stellar voice work. Chapters provide excellent points for breaks between gaming sessions, around 1 hour in length if you're looking at consuming this in chunks.Gameplay is pretty standard /above-average standard Point and Click, with the most interesting mechanic shown off in the first chapter (also available in the demo I believe). However the story, world building, and characterization are all phenomenal. Wadjet Eye show once again they excel at this style of story driven adventure games."
,Recommended,307580,18142889,"Posted: 22 September, 2015",all,SavageTech,"Excellent game, I bought it at full price and I'm glad I did because the devs deserve it. Easily amongst the best modern point-and-clicks I've played, and good enough to hold its own with the classics too. Its engaging story is bolstered by stellar worldbuilding that strikes the perfect balance between drowning the player in backstory vs giving them nothing outisde the main narrative. You get to delve deep into many aspects of the dystopian cyberpunk future that the game weaves around you, but there are plenty of things that are only mentioned or implied. This dichotomy makes the game/world feel much larger than it actually is, which is a rare trick in this age of exposition heavy Wiki-oriented games. The end result of the narrative and worldbuilding is a game that you won't want to stop playing, and I was a little sad when I completed it just because I knew that was all I'd get to see of this world.That said, it does have the same flaws as many other games of its type. Sometimes you won't be able to parse what the designer expects you to do next. Other times you'll overlook an interactable object and spend a good 15 minutes furiously trying everything in your inventory on all the interactable points until you realize you missed something. You'll be able to get hints from NPCs to help you past some of these issues, but they're still present and can be annoying when trying to complete the game without a walkthrough. I think it's worth noting that the hints were never immersion-breaking; the NPCs' advice always seemed to fit their characters and the situation at hand, rather than breaking the fourth wall and condescending to the player by practically telling them the solution.All in all, this is a must-have for anyone who loves point-and-click or cyberpunk. If you like both then scroll up, click ""Add to Cart,"" and free up the next 8-10 hours to be swept away by this masterpiece.Disclaimer: I did not receive this game for free, nor do I have any relationship to anyone involved with the game.

,Recommended,307580,18339405,"Posted: 5 October, 2015",all,MelBee42,"What a fantastic game. No offence meant to Wadjet Eye, but I'd played several of their games previously, including the Blackwell series and The Shivah, and found them kind-of-sort-of-OK - my main criticism being that they were *far* too short; as soon as the story even starts to get going, the game is suddenly over. Point and clicks are such a story driven genre that getting immersed in a great, involved story is, I feel, a vital factor.On this, Technobabylon delivers in spades. There's probably a good 15 hours of epic adventuring (if you even have the vaguest interest in talking to characters and exploring the world) and they're a great 15 hours.Pros+ Far better sound quality than previous Wadjet Eye games (Curious NB: In the commentary, Dave Gilbert - the company's 'big cheese' - says that this was the first time they used a professional voice recording studio rather than his house, and that the difference was palpable, although this was in the quality of the voice acting and that you'd probably only notice the difference in sound if you were an 'audiophile' - gotta say, I am nowhere near an 'audiophile', but the difference in sound quality of the dialogue in this is leaps and bounds ahead of the quality in the Blackwell games.)+ Decent voice acting (and lots of it - great if you like lots of opportunity to explore characters and their reactions to the world)+ As I have mentioned, great length, allowing you to get lost in the story, and also providing great value for the price. If you want to 100% the achievements, you'll be playing even longer+ Elements of choice - not a lot, but they were there, and that's relatively rare for a P&C+ Interesting concepts and setting+ Despite it being pixel art, it was quite beautiful in places+ Fantastic, logical puzzles - you're unlikely to need a walkthrough if you persevere just a little+ You get to play as several different characters which kept it interesting from chapter to chapter+ Almost no backtracking as your set of locations changes each chapter (pretty much), meaning solving even the toughest puzzles is more do-able because you do not have to wander round 50 different screens trying to combine items with 100s of things+ Interactive items are highlighted on screen so no pixel hunting.Cons- Why, oh why, must the characters waaaaalllllllk soooooo sloooooooowlllllly? This gets pretty tedious, particularly when you're a little stuck so you're wandering around trying a few different things.- Would be interesting in future to see them branch out into something other than pixel/retro art (this isn't necessarily a 'con' but the style may put some players off, and that's a shame, as everyone that likes point and clicks should try this!).TL:DR - If you liked previous Wadjet Eye games, you'll love this one; if you weren't keen on previous Wadjet Eye games I'd still recommend picking this up as it's their best by far (of the ones I've played); if you've never played a Wadjet Eye game but have even a passing interest in point and clicks, get this game, it's worth every penny.10/10 Would trance again."

You will love the first half hour or even the first hour depending on how long the initial puzzle takes you however any sense of this being a game for adults swiftly flies out the window by the second chapter.*Potential spoiler*In the comments below reviewers are making claims such as the ""good voice acting"" or ""impressive story line with interesting characters"" and....for the life of me I cannot comprehend how. In the three hours that I played I was introduced to three archetypes that were neither interesting or unique in any fashion. I lost faith in the ""fleshed out characters"" when a man fell from the sky and landed on a nearby car outside to which my characters calmly looked at the body made a few offhand remarks about how odd that was and proceeded to discuss the next objective. It could be argued that since the ""Omnipresent"" AI controls so much of the city that even sudden murder is viewed with an almost apathetic reaction but the game does little to give the player any sense of immersion or backstory for this to be believed. The dialogue is poorly spoken and the characters are bland cardboard cliches.This being said, I will admit that the interactions with some of the computer programs was genuinely fascinating and fulfilling. It is a sad state when the only enjoyable moments in the game come from the various AI interactions with panels and programs then with the actual human characters.Rereading the description I feel I should have known better.A cyberpunk adventure game from the studio that brought you Gemini Rue and Blackwell! The year is 2087. Genetic engineering is the norm, and an omnipresent AI powers the city. Take control of three citizens of this world as they struggle to understand a deadly conspiracy.An exclamation point and the phrase ""generic engineering is the norm.""I was not going into this game expecting novel trilogy building depth but if you are going to make a puzzle adventure game (and I am using the phrase puzzle lightly here) then you must make people care about what is happening and build a sense of interest in the characters.TL;DRRetro graphics cover up bland story with horrible voice acting and cliche story.

This truly is a masterpiece that any lover of science fiction or adventure games needs to experience.I haven't written a review in quite awhile but felt that this game deserved one. I'm an old gamer (in my mid-30s) and I've played a lot of games in my lifetime. Over the years, I've moved away from the Adventure genre but I started my decades long addiction when LucasArts was in its heyday so I've experienced more than my fair share of these type of games. While this is not the typical style of game I get into these days, I had picked up a copy a while back after reading some stellar reviews. Despite the strong recommendations online, I was honestly very surprised with how quickly I became hooked on this game after I finally got around to loading it up.Technobabylon is hands down one of the best storylines I've come across in a video game (a scifi plot as grandiose as any William Gibson or Neil Stephenson novel) and as a storytelling device, the adventure style of gameplay is masterfully implemented to deliver a truly compelling narrative. The graphics are by no means cutting edge but do have a sort of retro-style charm that reminds me strongly of the 90s game ""The Dig"". The puzzles are at times challenging but also masterfully intuitive. Never was i forced to consult a walkthrough but a few times I did have to walk away to clear my brain so I could reassess the task at hand. Perhaps even more telling is how amazingly the game pulls you into its world. Technobabylon incorporates a number of advanced sci-fi concepts which are very much incorporated into the puzzles but it delivers these concepts naturally so at no point did I feel like the game broke the 4th wall in order to explain some info necessary to move forward. Lastly worth noting were the multiple ""choose your own adventure"" elements which allowed for divergent paths within storyline. These elements were nothing extraordinary but it did lend the feeling that you were tailoring your own experience based on the subtle choices you made; just another example of the little subtleties that took this game from good to great.In summary, this game is one of those gems that grabs a hold of you and doesn't let you go until you have completed it at which point your drive to find out what happens is replaced by a sadness that the story has come to an end. It is quite rare that I experience this feeling with a video game.. as it is more common with a good book that you just can't put down. If you like science fiction storylines, adventure games or just good stories in general, do yourself a favor and pick up this game. 10/10Pros:+ One of the best storylines I've come across in 25+ years of gaming+ Playable characters are compelling and offer different playing styles which maintains the game tempo+ Interface and Inventory interaction are a joy to use (very well implemented)+ Puzzles are challenging but logically intuitive+ Scifi concepts are naturally delivered in a way that never breaks the immersion+ Voice and music audio are very well done+ Choose your own adventure elements give you a feeling of control without overdoing it to a point where you feel like you are missing a part of the storyline+ Graphics give the game a retro feel that lovers of the old LucasArts games will appreciate+ Multiple EndingsCons:- Graphics could be fairly classified as outdated and will turn off some gamers- Upon completion, will create a vacuum in your life which you will need to fill with more sci-fi storylines"

The game does some things really well and early on it looked quite promising. A strong plot with some clever puzzles combined with good voice acting had me hooked. Gradually the plot thins out though and the poor quality of the graphics starts to grate. The last part of the story just has one main puzzle to solve and then it's game over. A bit of a disappointment.
76561198021087888,Recommended,307580,23460570,"Posted: 8 June, 2016",all,Lujo,"Being something of an old-time adventure game veteran and and old-fart literary buff I'm conflicted about what to say on  Technobablyon. I've also often found that people are easily impressed by mediocre fare in just about anything, so me saying something is ""passable"" could mean it's the best thing you've ever seen in your life. That really depends on what you're used to more than anything. Having said that:The episodic format shows.The game kind-sort-of felt as if it wasn't made as a cohesive whole, and that individual ""episodes""  were too ""tight"" to really let you soak in the atmosphere. Which is a shame, as there was plenty of atmosphere, and the individual epozodes were rather good overall.However, it did feet like it was going out of it's way to put the player in one ""room escape"" scenario after another. The overall plot was a bit too grand which made various things feel a bit too drastic. It seems to have elements in place, so to speak, for large multi-plot games like, say, Discworld: Noir, but it turns out to not really be that kind of game. I guess the plot feels strangely  linear, because the game has the old style grapics groove going on, but lacks a central semi-non-linear ""open world"" item chase chapter that's a staple of the old non-episodic classics. Making one of those is a nightmare, and it would've made the game twice as long, but the game felt like it needed more time to develop it's various characters, and more space to disperse it's dialogue, world-building and commentary in. For a game which makes dialogue so fun and easy to perform and enjoy, it doesn't really do enough with the dialogue because secondary characters are either villains or only there for one scene.For example, I feel the ""comm"" feature was an incredible idea, one that's probably been kicking around many point-and-click and detective game enthusiasts heads. Except it's hardly ever used in the most obvious way it would be used in most games - to cut the time it takes to walk around various locations when you just want to talk to a character. I can think of dozens of games that feature would've made much better than they were (many of them classics). In this game it's usability is severely limited because the game lacks that central faux open-world part. Big props to to the person who went and put that into their game, finally, as it might influence someone else to put it in a game that makes more use out of it. Heck, you could take all the shooty / RPG bits out of Fallout 2, rewrite it as a straight point-and-click / dialogue thing, add that feature to the radio so that you can contact folks over distance, and you'd be rolling in money.Which is to say there's some really good stuff here. The android related puzzles were impossibly cool, the actual ""investigation"" episode was also very cool, there's great stuff all over the place. But there are also a few too many instances of characters being able to perform certain actions without the actions making sense at the time. I think I just stumbled onto the solutions to many puzzles, and at times I was stuck because I didn't realize certain actions could even be performed, so I would be lacking a step in an otherwise logical sequence of moves. This might mean that a few things had a step-or-two too many, and for this, I blame the episodic format again - if actions required to accomplish something didn't have to all involve so discreet scenations the flow would be much better.I've heard complaints about the graphics from folks who can't appreciate symbolic art over ""realism"". I've mixed feelings about it. I'm not necessarily in love with the pixels, as I found the recent remasterings of Lucas Arts stuff quite fine, and I did at times feel like this game could've benefited from a bit more resolution. I wasn't sure it would benefit from more ""realism"" that would end up creating - the gory bits, and there ARE gory bits, would've stood out more, and the naive bits, and there ARE naive bits, would have stood out more, too. Since pacing makes certain plot related things a bit jarring, more detailed graphics wouldn't have necessarily helped there. Plus, quite a bunch of the art is gorgeous.Now, most of this soounds like criticism, but when you get down to it, I've not really played a more ambitious point-and-clicker that actually delivered as much as Technobabylon did in quite a while. It did more for me on the cyberpunk front than the Shadowrun games, too. I feel like the folks who made it deserve their money, and that the game isn't really dissapointing as much as it stimulates the player to think about how would they have done it better afterwards. Which is a great thing.I recommend."

I have played most of them and some of them stuck in my mind, others disappeared quickly. Technobabylon is one of those games who have stuck in my mind.The setting of the game is perfect, a dystopian large city controlled by some big force, and lots of high tech (hence the perfect quote ""High Tech, Low Life""). The characters are very likeable and interesting, and the story is great as well. If you have played Gemini Rue, which is also sort of Cyberpunk, I can say that this game delivers on a much larger scale.It took me around 9 hours to finish the game, and I took my time interacting with everything and getting stuck on difficult puzzles. I had to use walkthroughs for some of the puzzles, but it's nothing too extreme. The soundtrack is in my opinion of the best aspects of the game, pin-pointing the dystopian setting.I give this game a 10/10, since I liked every aspect of it, and because it totally nails my vision of a perfect Cyberpunk future"

,Recommended,307580,28897585,Posted: 1 January,all,too many james,"Absolutely loved it.I'm someone who doesn't do well with games that require reaction times, coordination, or patience, so basically I don't really expect any games to be totally fulfilling to me. But♥♥♥♥♥♥ I guess I didn't see Technobabylon coming. I'll admit I had to refer to walkthroughs for a lot of the second half of this game, but honestly I wish I hadn't because all the puzzles are actually completely achievable if you think about them long enough (again, patience isn't a strong point for me).All of the gameplay aspects totally hooked me right off the bat - I started this game right on the cusp of Christmas and the New Year, and I spent a lot of moments that probably should have been spent celebrating playing this game instead. I have no regrets. Awesome start to 2017. This game gave me clear skin, cured my depression and inspired me to achieve more.Anyway, that's before we even get to the characters. Honestly the characters in any game always make or break it for me, and in this case they totally made it. Charlie is incredibly sweet and easy to relate with, Latha is simulateously adorable and the coolest protagonist ever, and Lao is a ♥♥♥♥ing boss. This is the point where my stupidly in-depth review that noone is gonna read gets more spoilery and much more contentious, but it had a massive impact on my experience so I'm just gonna have to go there...A large problem people seem to perceive with minority characters is this idea that they only exist for the creator to show off how 'socially aware' they are. I mostly see people who aren't part of the minority groups at hand talking about this, and honestly, the only way you could make any kind of insightful critisism of a minority character is if you ARE that minority. I know we all like to think that we can think through every puzzle in the world whether it's race or gender, but I've had to learn over a long time that it's definitely not as simple as just thinking objectively.As a white person in New Zealand, I do all I can to advocate against racial violence, because I'm never going to experience having my rights as a white person being subtly exploited on a grand scale, via laws implemented by other white people back when you could sell human beings.Any opinion I have on Lao's writing or characterisation as an East Asian character are never going to be as good or in depth as those of any given Asian person, because I just don't know what it's like to be Asian. Even just under the general title of 'transgender' I'm sure you can hear a million different feelings and interpretations on Max Lao, from people with massively different experiences and perspectives. With this in mind, that's why I roll my eyes when I see people who aren't transgender talking smack about the presence of trans characters in media. If you want to help keep damaging or stupid characterisations out of games, any of the people writing those reviews will probably give you lots of stuff to look out for (see: the trope of being outed against one's will).WITH THAT BEING SAID. I loved Lao. I love how her backstory is revealed, I love how she is the one who CHOOSES to reveal it to Charlie on her own terms, and I love how for once I got to play a game that doesn't decide to have a protagonist who can probe the trans character with invasive or demeaning questions *cough Dragon Age Inquisition cough*. Obviously those interactions have their place, but Jesus, we get it already. There are more interesting conversations to see about a character being trans than just that. The world will not suffer for having one less game where a character gets interrogated on why she chose to be a girl.As anyone who's still reading has probably guessed at this point, I'm transgender myself, but I don't know what it's like to be raised as a boy and then try and carve my way from there. It's a hugely different experience and there is a lot to Lao that I honestly can't really say whether it's done right or not, I just wouldn't know.And I mean even aside from all this, it's really a pretty miniscule plot point, so I don't know if I missed anything but there's not really a whole lot of room FOR a problem. This makes it seem like it was a humungous part of the game and it really wasn't, as with a lot of other minority appearances, re: the interracial gay couples I've seen someone get massively upset over. As well as a robot that they claimed to be gay, with no supporting evidence. But that's none of my business.There's not really much I can say about the other minority appearances in this game, other than 'they were there'. It would've been a really cool opportunity to have a disabled character that wasn't a villain, but again, I don't really know much more about that - maybe we'll see that in the next installment from these guys!I LOVE this game. It wasn't perfect, but I definitely didn't see this review coming when I bought this game and had I known I would've happily paid more. I'm definitely going to be recommending this to people in the future, and keeping tabs on the team behind it because they were the ones who DECIDED for make such bold claims for this game, and it paid off. I'm excited for even bolder games from them in the future - more self-loving transgender characters, please!! :D"

,Not Recommended,307580,29536482,Posted: 28 January,all,Studious,"Now, right off the bat; credit where credit is due: there is a lot of work that was put into this. This was clearly someone's passion project. Either that or someone's first stab at making something so cohesive and interesting. It was a valiant effort on the creator's part. And I want to stress my appreciation for the talent and effort put into this. Even if I can't really sink my teeth into it personally. From the art to the lore to the voice talent, you can tell that people really labored over this; that much is evident. However, there are some parts missing here. There are some ingredients missing from the soup,Technobabylon is a story about a futuristic world that couldn't care less. Cloned babies, overbearing artificial intelligence, zero privacy, escapism, nuclear war, and the ever present looming threat of scarcity masked as abundance. Everything is here and accounted for. What I can give Technobabylon credit for is how it presents its setting. It doesn't bother to bombard you. It gives you clues about this world you're experiencing. And aside from a set of very specific situations, it isn't required that you care at all about this setting. The characters themselves clearly don't. That's a little more believable in my opinion. If we all lived in the dystopia, I'd doubt that anyone would care after so long. That's natural for these characters, and this is shown in game. Kudos.Now, I'm going to have to take those kudos right back, because for these steps forward, Technobabylon makes some very curious design choices. I know it's the future in all, but this game has a bizarre fixation on fitting in some heavyweight rhetoric in the wrong places. What do I mean? Well, early in the game we learn that one of the major characters underwent a sex change. Wowee. And this is just mentioned in passing. Never comes up. Never adds much to the character other than a moment of, ""uhh.. ok?"" If anything this soured my vision of one of the characters right off the bat. Why would I care about a character's gender? Or past gender? Especially if this point was treated with none of the tact and meaning that a subject like this usually requires.Later in the game we're introduced to a homosexual couple who have a synthetic housemaid who's strongly implied to be assisting them in the bedroom. Did I say strongly implied? I mean outright stated. Now, that's fantastic and all, but this is just dropped and left to sit there. The most we know about them is they like Paris. That's about it... Again, no investment. No meaning whatsoever. Strike two. The last straw came late in the game when I witnessed the fastest devolution of what could've been mildly entertaining dialogue into what was essentially akin to ""mind your pronouns."" Apparently the distinction between gynoid and android is very important? Also, points for me reacting almost exactly like the villain did.Contrast this with the only straight relationship in the game: Regis and his wife. This relationship isn't impactful because its straight, its impactful because it plays a significant role in these character's motivations. It plays into the plot a lot more. It actually contributes. In fact, this point would've remained entirely unchanged if it were a homosexual relationship anyway. I feel like the game tried to make it a point to include these things but ended up making them completely insubstantial as a result.As far as the rest of the game goes, I can say everything blends together more or less. It does the setting well, like I said, but failure to utilize this and make something meaningful just leads to more disappointment. The characters are serviceable. So is the plot. It really comes down to how predictable you like your point and click games. I could guess the big twist about two hours before I actually completed the game. And while I'm throwing stones, the last area and the ending are so horribly contrived that it ruins anything the game was trying to set up. Some special thread of voodoo magic is tying these character's fates together. It's up to Regis Philbin and two other people to save the world I guess.For what it's worth, this is an alright experience. I wouldn't recommend it for a few reasons. The later half of the game suffers from lack of direction, and it all trails into the worst parts of the game. Puzzles fall into two categories: immediately obvious and impossible. Out of the entire cast, Regis was the only one I was vaguely interested in. The entire rest of the cast was more or less forgettable or boring. And the big top off is the ending. For the asking price, this is an alright game to put some hours into. But honestly, I just don't regard it as exceptional."

Most people coming to play Technobabylon are coming from the game Gemini Rue, so I'll explain it sort of from that viewpoint. If you haven't played Gemini Rue, it's pretty similar to this game, although quite a bit more interesting.Gameplay is, as one would expect, nil. There are a few small puzzles and lots of random desperate clicking around-- but, for the most part, it's an interactive story; similar to something you'd find made by Telltale games, except you don't really have freedom of choice other than the somewhat-literal deus ex machina at the end of the game. This is not an inherently bad thing, but DOES mean that high expectations are held for the game's story, which is where things start to fall flat.The story, in a similar manner to Gemini Rue, is focused around the lives of three characters-- and none of them are particularly interesting. We've got an infertile genre-required police detective under blackmail, a transsexual tech-expert cop, and a 'trance-junkie' (who remains entirely unrelated to the other characters until the last ~10 minutes of gameplay), the 'trance' being a cheap knockoff of William Gibson's idea of 'cyberspace'; an idea that's been taken almost nowhere past its origins in the genre. The villains are also mostly uninteresting-- which is quite a turn-off.Technobabylon piqued my interest, especially at the beginning, but really only left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Every time that I thought that the game was about to get better, it'd get worse-- whether because of boring puzzles or because of boring plot cliches.I'm not going to say that Technobabylon is a trainwreck, but it's certainly not worth the $15."

,Recommended,307580,16956861,"Posted: 9 July, 2015",all,Bungeeman,"Wadjet Eye’s reputation for making solid adventure games is well deserved and Technobabylon is no exception to this trend. From the atmospheric opening credits to the tumultuous ending, this game is packed full of originality and atmosphere. In Technobabylon, you play the role of two disenfranchised citizens in the sprawling metropolis of Newton. The year is 2087 and the entire city is controlled by an all-seeing, all-knowing artificial intelligence known as ‘Central.’Charlie Regis, an old-school detective with a background in human engineering and a poverty-stricken young woman named Latha Sesame with an addiction to the ‘trance’ (a kind of futuristic, full-sensory internet) serve as our protagonists. Charlie does not trust Central to the point that he regularly covers up the camera in his office under the pretence that it is malfunctioning. His appreciation for privacy and his belief in the human side of police work make him something of an odd-ball in a city which simply accepts the convenience of rule by AI. He serves as the plot’s moral compass, especially when compared to his partner, Max Lao, who embraces the complexity of technology in all of its forms. Similarly, Latha Sesame is an expert at the use of the trance, a kind of state of meditation which allows humans to physically interact with computers and technology through the use of an organic material known as ‘wetware.’If I’m making the plot of Technobabylon sound complex that’s because it is, but the game presents it in such a way that it becomes easy to digest. Take, for example, the concept of the ‘trance.’ The opening puzzle shows the player exactly how this works when Latha is unable to leave her apartment due to a power cut. She must then utilize her abilities to trance with the various AIs which control the objects in her room. One of them is a security obsessed anti-virus program, designed with the personality of a medieval knight. The other is an annoyingly chirpy, anime-inspired computer chef named ‘Cheffie’, responsible for cooking and preparing meals for the inhabitants of all apartments in the city. These AIs become some of the most entertaining and ultimately compelling characters in the game and in truth, I was left feeling that Technobabylon could have explored this idea further. There are other AIs in the game but not nearly as many as I had hoped for and that early promise was, to a certain extent, never delivered upon. But in truth, I’m nit-picking.Despite suffering from the often convoluted style of puzzle-design that seems to have dogged the point-and-click genre forever, Technobabylon’s puzzles are usually tough but fair. However, where the game really shines is in its presentation of the city of Newton and its inhabitants. The colossal sky-line flanking the highway as Charlie’s patrol car speeds to its next destination, the incorporeal cyber-bar where trance-addicted techno-junkies meet to anonymously dance and play computer games, the dilapidated, graffiti-ridden factories of an abandoned district of the city. All these locations come together to create the impression of a living, breathing city, a city that you believe could really exist sixty years from now. This is aided in no small part by the excellent, ambient soundtrack which, for me, was very reminiscent of the original Deus Ex’s score.The plot is brilliantly original, especially in the already bloated cyberpunk genre, a genre which Wadjet Eye have already explored in 2011’s ‘Gemini Rue.’ But where Gemini Rue’s World felt oppressive, claustrophobic and ultimately constrictive, the city of Newton feels open and is presented as a bastion of liberal thinking and left-wing acceptance, all the while giving you the impression that this image might just be merely another tool for control of the populace. Valtaire’s famous statement that “it is difficult to free fools from the chains they revere” springs instantly to mind and this subversion of the old cyberpunk cliché of a right-wing government being obviously evil and brutally oppressive is a real breathe of fresh air.Technobabylon is definitely a game for fans of the genre. If you’re looking for non-stop action and intense gameplay then you won’t find it here. But chances are, unless you’re a Victorian time traveller who has never played a computer game before, you already knew that. Solid puzzles, beautiful level design, decent voice acting and a constantly intriguing plot make Technobabylon an adventure well worth embarking on and at just $14.99/£10.99 it is also an adventure which won’t break your wallet."

This particular dystopian cyberpunk society includes a youth fad where people use nanomachines to give themselves the symptoms of ""retro"" diseases, a street preacher that wants to sell you drugs to get you addicted to the real world and off the evil internet, and more competing factions than you can shake a stick at.  Three viewpoint characters you swap between at plot points (two cops with biosci PHD's, and a jobless net addict), one of whom happens to be trans -- an interesting throw-away detail that doesn't define the character.Themes include AI, surveilance, and a little bit about the definition of consciousness.  You get to make morally-based choices on things, by which I mean stuff like ""blame this guy for something serious because you think he's evil, or blame the real but more personable culprit"".

The world and characters are layers deep, as mentioned above, you can browse the net in game, play games, read the news, even check your mail. The characters have multiple dimensions that give them (and by extension the player) motivation to make questionable decisions. Also something I find quite novel for a point n' click, there are often multiple ways to resolve a given situation instead of having to find the right items to be used in the right way to advance. It has a fantastic story and typical of any SCI-FI piece, throws loads of nouns at you to wrestle with bringing you deeper into it's world.TL;DR Great game with fantastic characters & story, any SCI-FI fan particularly of things from Bladerunnrer to The Matrix should definitely check this out."

Not just ""click random thing on random other things until stuff happens"". You can actually THINK about the puzzles, think about what could actually solve them, then work towards those solutions, making for satisfying gameplay!The characters are also smart! They're different, wrong sometimes, make mistakes, but they actually try to think and understand what is going on. I enjoyed all of the protagonists.I'm happy to say that every time I got stumped on a puzzle (with one minor exception, mentioned below), it wasn't because the solution was bizarre or counter-intuitive, it was just that I hadn't thought about the actual facts of puzzle the right way.The major downside is the ending (spoilers).A minor flaw is it sloppily scripted (lots of weird bugs that you can cause, nothing game-breaking but obviously not been through thorough QA, like the door lock lights disappearing (not turning off - literally disappearing) after you go through the door and return, or Lao being able to hand her wetware to Regis but not get it back).It's also unclear that there is an entire third floor in the Trance, making the final part of the puzzle a matter of luck or blind guesswork.But the big part is the endings are unsatisfying. Either you force a person into slavery, or you force them into being someone else's agenda and to go through an invasive mind-altering procedure without their input. I would have been much happier if there was a third option, where you can actually respect the autonomy of the AGI and let it free without compulsion.

Sadly she's booted out as someone locks her in her apartment. So you work to break out.Following this opening you're introduced to the other main characters of the game: Regis and Lao who work for CEL which is the game's version of the police. You're tasked with investigating a building where a murder might take place in a little while, as predicted by the central AI of the city.The controls are intuitive with left-click being action and right-click being ""look at"". You do have an inventory, accessed from the bottom right of the screen, though you never end up carrying too many items. I will say for me that MOST of the puzzles in this game were fairly logical, with the game providing enough context and ideas for you to work out solutions for yourself. It also helped that, on a few occasions, I couldn't leave the scene I was in without solving all the problems so that narrows down where the solutions must be.The main puzzled I struggled with involved me having to leave the building i was in to talk to a man who had appeared outside with no indication. The character was not there when I went in the building. Once I had done that, the rest of the puzzles dropped into place.I enjoyed exploring the world these characters exist in and seeing this particular interpretation of the future. It's not an interpretation I would care to live in however.  Although I would like to explore ""the trance"".A solid addition to the point-and-click adventure game genre. More please!"
