The item system has really gotten me interested. I probably overlooked it a bit at first. The healing stuff in particular. You need to be careful when you use them depending on what they are. Apples heal 1 HP, Meat 2, etc. Some items work best against some enemies and other works better against other enemies. Using your items wisely and storing important ones you know you'll need later at your Owl pet gives the game another depth you don't notice at first glance.The difficulty is still really high and we had to play a lot to learn the different enemy patterns. Somehow I still have trouble reaching the highest enemy with double jump, it might be my controller so I'll leave it at that for now.The online multiplayer works almost flawlessly with no lag at all so far and I strongly recommend to have a friend to play with. You can be a lot smarter with items, and even switch items using the owl to let the player that needs it more get it. It seems to be a lot more built for co-op than single player. Which I'm totally fine with and it gets really hard on your own.Graphics are really cute, the two bosses I've met so far have really sweet animations and the character design overall is great, the ghosts are my favourites so far.The only thing I miss really, is a health bar for the boss. So you can be even more smart with your items. I can't see any obvious problems with adding it.PROS:Nice, cute graphics/animations with a lot of personalityMusic works well with the environments and the sound design stay very true to retro games like Castlevania. holding 'Down' to dance is a fun detail as well.Surprisingly deep and interesting item systemFlawless local/online multiplayerCONS:Difficulty is a tad too steep, doable but very frustrating at pointsThe lack of boss health bar-----------------------------------------------------Most people I've talked to have had a pretty rough first 2+ hours, and it really do take a bit of time to figure everything out. Which might not be reflected in how the game is shown in media. But it's definitely worth a shot for anyone who likes a challenge and is fine with raging for a bit before you get the hang of it."

Would I reccomend this game? I wouldn't. Not for full price, anyway.First I think I should delve into things I do like about the game. The music, the visuals and the overall aesthetic are really nice-- it's what attracted me to the game in  the first place. The music is brilliant with memorable tracks. That being said, I haven't gotten past the first stage so I've potentially only heard three or four of the total number of tracks.The thing I don't like is the actual gameplay itself. I don't mind the fact that it's a brawler with enemies swarming near constantly. I'm used to it as I've played games like Castlevania where enemies continue to respawn. But What I don't like is the movement lock when your player character attacks an enemy with a lot of health. It's fine if you only have to press the attack button once, but on enemies that take two or three punches it's irritatingly unfair to be locked in place without the ability to push them back with your attacks. Either the attacks should be better weighted, or you should be granted the ability to move while attacking.The largest problem for the mechanics of this game is that punching and kicking is essentially all you do which make the mechanics more glaringly frustrating and grueling. EDIT: It's also worth mentioning that the item pick ups add another layer of frustration. You must choose between attacking with your body, attacking with a very perishible item that may only eliminate one enemy from the screen, or healing if multiple items and enemies pop on you.It does have multiplayer but I prefer playing alone and since this game does have a singleplayer option, I don't feel as though buying a miserable, unplayable time by myself makes any sense.Try it if the premise interests you, but I wouldn't be surprised if you returned it."

This makes it feel less challenging and more unfair. Also bogged down by a crafting system that just isn't that interesting and makes me hesitate to use powerup items because I might need them later to craft stuff. Probably more fun co-op."
76561197993804131,Recommended,307620,17630772,"Posted: 20 August, 2015",all,Positron,"I have a very mixed, but cautiously positive opinion of Curses 'N Chaos.  I've detailed the bulk of my thoughts in video format here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efUQ70co8w0I've tentatively listed this review for 'recommended', but it should be noted that I have a fairly significant issue with the game.  There's a lot about the game that's very fun to me, despite issues preventing me from really sinking time into it.Before I go into my issues with the game, let's talk about strengths:Gorgeous art, beautifully animated.  The level of detail present in the characters and backgrounds while still adhering to the pixelart aesthetic is quite remarkable.Awesome Audio.  Much like the graphics, both the soundtrack and sound effects nail the atmosphere perfectly.Content-rich.  For an arcade-style, score-attack, single-screen brawler, Curses 'N Chaos has a lot going on.  10 levels comprising a ton of enemy types and huge inventory of items to use.Alchemy system is deeper than it seems at first glance, with a fair amount of strategy in selecting, mixing, and storing items to help you survive or boost your score.I feel the game really only has one core flaw, but it's a major one in my eyes.The controls leave a lot to be desired and lead to a fair amount of what I call 'button fatigue'.  The characters (who control identically) have a standing punch, jump kick, run/run-punch, uppercut, and double jump as their standard moves.Part of this issue manifests itself in the relative uselessness of the standing punch simply by design of animation lock.  When you punch from a stand-still, or uppercut, there's a significant amount of delay where you're locked into that animation and can't move.  On the flipside, the jump-kick not only allows you to still move while you're doing it, but it does twice as much damage as the standing punch.  This leads to a situation where you will almost exclusively jumpkick most enemies, meaning you're always pressing two buttons to attack.  The uppercut works well against flying enemies that divebomb, but once you hit later stages this becomes a trap as it doesn't do enough damage to kill them in one blow, meaning you'll take a hit while you're stuck in the animation.The vast majority of flying enemies also reside at a height that can only be reached with a max height double jump.  Some are intended to only be attackable when they dive down, but others remain at that height and take multiple hits.  This means for every single attack against those enemies, you're looking at a minimum of 3 button presses.  This might sound like nitpicking, but it becomes very tiring to play the game after an extended period of time.This leads to a situation where a some of the difficulty seems a fault of the controls, not necessarily a result of the design.  I did also encounter a few cases where it seemed hitboxes were a bit off, but that's a little harder to substantiate and may partly be a result of control issues.To offer thoughts on a solution:Shortening the animation lock on the standing punch or allowing the animation to be canceled feels like it would go a long way.  Additionally, increasing the base jump height or reworking the idea behind the double jump as a whole would greatly reduce 'button fatigue'.  The game is very difficult by design, but having a smoother control scheme would make it infinitely more satisfying to play.To reiterate: Ultimately I enjoy a lot of what the game has to offer, but the control issues keep me from really pouring a lot of time into it or wanting to shoot for high scores.  Building up a x9 multiplier only to get stuck in an animation, be mere pixels off a max height double jump to reach an enemy, or colliding with an odd-sized hitbox is just frustrating.EDIT: To provide a very specific example on the hitbox issue for the devs - look at the second boss fight, at 27:04 I end up taking a hit with a very sizable gap between myself and the boss.  What's more curious is if you look closely at my attacks before then, I'm actually clipping the boss's sprite slightly on every hit before then.  The inconsistency is what leads to that feeling of, 'why did I get hit there?'.  I think the player hitbox is lenient most times, but just not consistently."

Extremely satisfying to build up big chains and score more points/gold. The item mixing system is a fun little mechanic that gives the game some added depth.Only minor complaint is the awkward difficulty shifts throughout the game. The game is very challenging, and never unfair - but it can be somewhat jarring when the difficulty radcially spikes.All in all, a great time! Haven't tried co-op yet, but looking forward to it!"

,Recommended,307620,17953140,"Posted: 8 September, 2015",all,William Shakesman,A game about being in a one screen platforming room and jump kicking everything else dumb enough to get on that screen.

,Recommended,307620,17630019,"Posted: 20 August, 2015",all,ZType,"A really enjoyable arcade game with very good super low-res pixel art.The artistic part of the game is absolutely inspiring. The difficulty is high but —as in any good arcade game— it allows you to go further every time you play. Learning and getting better at the game's nature and parameters is part of the experience. BUT sometimes the gameplay is more punishing than I expected. I can't say it's due to a bad design, but a matter of getting used to the game's tempo:It seems the game needs to be more responsive sometimes. There's a certain delay between your actions and the character.If you are facing a direction while punching enemies you can't change to the opposite one with ease. You need to stop, face the other direction and start punching again. Once again, it's a matter of tempo. But a bit frustrating on occasions.The main character's death or impact animations are exaggerated IMO and the recovery is slow. The added displacement often gets you into an even more complicated situation.But the most important thing:it crashes all the time on Mac.Constantly. For no specific reason. I haven't been able to finish a single play without crashing, which is really, really annoying, considering it's an arcade game with no continues. Super unstable. I'd like to read more reviews by Mac users an see if this is usual. I think the game would improve with some little twists and —above all— avoiding the crashes on Mac. Otherwise, it's unplayable.Despite all these things, still a great, beautiful and addictive old-school arcade game."

,Recommended,307620,24101669,"Posted: 4 July, 2016",all,Stupid McNoheals,"My recommendation is mostly positive, but with some large reservations.  As a 10-wave, single-screen survival brawler, Curses 'N Chaos is enjoyable, and the pixel art is impeccable.  The money grind for endgame can get tedious, but C'NC's other positive qualities make this less annoying.  Sadly, Tribute Games didn't port the game quite right from Sony systems to PC/MAC.  Many users have reported performance issues ranging from running too slow to running far, far too fast, and while some of these problems have been fixed via a patch from September 2015, the endings remain glitchy.  As a fan of the game's art assets, it pains me to see artifacting like that of a failed ROM check spewed across the screen after a successful playthrough, and so I say to you: if you don't have a Playstation 4 or Vita, then buy this and hope for a patch to clean things up a bit, but stay away otherwise."

This game is a wave game, survive and you fight the boss. It is a trail and error with the enemies using weapons. You can't hold more than 1 item and they have an owle as an inventory which I hate more. If they allow you to store more than one item that would be great. But you get so many item drops at the first wave that forces you to use them and then later on you hardly get any drop. You wait 10 waves and then you fight the boss, that is all. And the worst part is it was designed to be played as two people in mide, meaning you will have too many mosnters on the screen that you can't keep up with if you play alone. And to top off the worst part, you have time limit. If you fail to kill all the wave in 60 seconds, Death will appear on the screen and he can 1 hit kill you.. Playing this solo is annoying and isnt fun unless you have a friend with no lag issues between you two. With two players, it would be fun to play.I recommend buying it on a sale for 0.75% off it really gets repetitive fast.  I was tricked into thinking this is a 2D scroll game from the teailer, I should have checked videos before buying because I hate wave enemy games.I repeat this is not a side scrolling game, it is just one Place and enemies come at you.

It is just difficult, but the good kind, the well made kind. Most of the complaints regarding gameplay I've seen are solved by just playing well or understanding how to execute certain motions or moves.The game does a poor job of explaining itself and the controls. There are very helpful techniques such as,Uppercut - Up+AttackDash Attack - Dash+Attack*One of the most useful techniques is to jump, attack, then immediately double jump and attack again. The jump attack is powerful, executing it twice in a row with well timed double jumps is very useful.It's also fun to manage items. You can hold one at a time on yourself. Use your owl to hold an item for later use. I usually keep a healing item on my owl for emergencies.I've got respect for Tribute Games for making solid arcade style games in the modern age. This game is worth the 10 bucks. I play this on Ps4, to explain my lack of playtime on Steam."
