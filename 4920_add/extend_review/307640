As much as I loved the game, though, I can't justify a $20 price-tag. It's fun, has many different gameplay elements in it, and is overall just a great game, but the original Stick RPG 2 was a free game with a few Director's Cut paywalls. If you want, play the free version and pick this up if it's on sale, but I can't reccomend this game with what it is.EDIT: If the pricetag isn't an issue for you, it's still a great game, a fun game I unloaded hours into and recommend it a lot."

The problem is, that when it was free it was never finished, and 10 years later, it still feels like its a free game. Here are some of the frustrating problems I have encountered.First off, the aspect ratio is crap in the game, unless you go fullscreen. That means it is either really small, or it locks you into one screen when most people have two monitors. Not a big deal, unless you want to watch Netflix while playing, then its agrivating as hell.In a world where quest lists and pull up maps are a given, it breaks the flow of the game when you are given a quest. How might you ask? Well because you will immediantly forget about a quest given, and items are rarely found/given, whenever a task is presented to you, it means you will have to prettymuch stop whatever you are doing, and go for that task, unless you don't care. Its not like ""Hey do you have a popsicle?"" and then find one a little bit later. Not the case in this game, so either you are playing with a walkthrough, or break flow and go task running.There really seems to be no direction, if you forget the last step you where on, guess what, you have to retrace to see if you can remember where you are. And this game has a ♥♥♥♥ing time system, which means quests and quest givers are dependent on the time of the day, so a walkthrough is probably a neccesity if you don't want to run around a city hunting down during each time period for stuff.The reward system in this game is meh, doing the right thing screws you, and doing the wrong thing still screws you. I have had to save/quit/load because even if you are working a normal job, you can lose days worth of progress in stat loss. It is frustration from a system that when it first came out was fun, but now is outdated. And here is how work in this game works: run up to the place that you have enough stats to work at. Click person a few times a day. Run to place to sleep. Repeat. FOR A PAID GAME I WANT SOME DAMN VARIETY! This is a point in click game 10 years in the making that literal thousands of dollars would have been pledged to through a kickstarter to make it right. They did nothing in the time between Stick RPG 1 & 2 it seems. Its not edgy, its not original, and its not updated.If you have the nostaliga bug, ignore it. This is a poor remake of a game that inspired an entire generation of flash game makers. I wanted to love this game, I bought it the second I saw it was out on Steam. Stick RPG 2 can be best described as a middle finger to anyone guilible enough to purchase it. Outdated design, lack of innovation, annoying aspect ratio, no direction, and archiach structuring is why I couldn't recommend this game under any circumstances.Edit* 2014/07/07: Save games apparently are a huge issue in this game as well. Ive lost mine, then they came back, then didn't, and they go through this process where you may or may not have to sign up with Xgen's website. Didn't mention it before, but thought it might as well be called out as well. They do seem to come back, but its when the game seems to want to."

So I thought ""Hey, the full version should have loads more content, right?""Boy, was I wrong. Don't buy this game.The ""Fullscreen"" option is letterboxed 4:3, and is just it's original tiny resolution stretched out. It looks so bad it's unplayable, you have to play it in the orignal resolution. All the additional content is right at the end of the game by which point it's just repetitious, and most importantly: It just feels like a flash game.

And when I saw this game on Steam, I jumped at the chance to relive those memories of my childhood I blew on Flash games like Stick RPG 2. And those memories came back, for the first hour, the next two were slowly realizing this game's critical flaw.There's one issue with this game: You can play the same game for free, still on those sites. In fact, the only thing this ""Director's Cut"" adds is an entire small area with a whole 3 different jobs, a few combat zones and a small plot involving murder. It also gives you cheats of varying utility, mostly making the grind easier to pull off. But everything else about this game is stock standard from the free online game, in fact too much is.I blew 2.99 on this game, and that's the lowest I've ever seen it go and I still wasn't satisfied. This game needs a lot more content to differentiate itself from the online version, and it doesn't. It's still in the same resolution with the same annoying XGen save system, the same incredibly outdated memes and the same music. It's a incredibly painful port of the game onto Steam in an attempt to revive nostalgia in people of the original game without much attempt to make it better than the free version still available to play on every flash game site on the Internet.My advice: Play the free version online and leave this overpriced port to languish in the same hell that all bad ports sink into."

It's worth mentioning that you can still play games like these for free on Newgrounds, so to drop actual money on this or not is totally your prerogative.As for the gameplay you should know what you're in store for if you played the original Stick RPG.  You wake up, go somewhere in the city to click on a dialogue option repeatedly until you've increased your stat/money quota for the day, head home, sleep and repeat.  It's mind numbingly dull but oddly relaxing if you're in the right mindset.  This game hit the spot for me at a time where I was so record breakingly lazy that any and all other video games on Earth seemed like they required too much effort to play.The resolution is terrible and there's no way to modify it.  Fullscreen mode looks ugly.  You have to go into this game wanting it really bad, or having brain damage like me, otherwise you're probably going to throw up.  The bright side is that Stick RPG 2 a finalized product and not another Early Access game stuck in purgatory forever.I think the creator and I would get along really well, his humor is as unfunny as mine.  I like that."

Once you manage to buy all the homes and stores there isnt really much to do. There are some deeds you do for other people but thats generally boring and unrewarding.

I was a fan of Xgen Studios and played various games they made including the prequel of this one and motherload et cetera. I loved the worlds they created and Stick RPG 2 was the best of them. I knew of everything of this game including things like glitches, how to efficiently play, and all the possible outcomes of every choice there is to make and I still remember most of it. It is a great game, and I would recommend it, and I even bought a few extra copies of the Director’s Cut just to make my friends play it.However, there is a catch. One of the main reason being the fact that it is quite overpriced. Like I said, it is a game that can be memorized. It is not that long and you can play most of it for free online. It is more of a donating money the developers than buying the game. But, this is all and fair and Steam sales at 80 percent takes care of the price issue. What Steam did not solve are the saves. I am not a fan of making accounts and I also do not have a Xgen account. So, when the Director’s Cut came out with catchphrases like “Extra sauce and play offline” I put a big emphasis on the play offline, because that also meant saving offline. It does but the save goes away quite easily – most notably by cleaners such as CCleaner. I thought Steam would have the Steam Cloud save the day, but it did not and I was left, again, with the feeling of helplessness when you have lost the save file of a game you have put so much into……. And there aren’t no Steam achievement or badges….The bottom line is to ALWAYS REMEMBER TO EXCLUDE Stick RPG 2 or Steam itself when using cleaners such as CCleaner."

Buying it on steam means you get the Directors cut, which basically gives you more overall gamplay. Though, it may be good to first check it out on your broswer and see if you like it. Then you can decide if you wish to buy it on here or add it on to your broswer, either way it still means buying it.It's basically a little, what the title says Stick RPG game. You can work in jobs and get paid, kill mobsters, own a castle, and much more. One of my favorite features, because I am a noob is the cheats, which is only available to the Directors edtion, that to me makes the game a lot more enjoyable because honestly it gets repitive after a good while of gamplay.Overall, I did by this Directors Edition for about 50% off, and honestly I do not think I would buy it full priced.

Loath the day the developers acutely have that much creative genius to put something that good of an idea into their game. No you go into work and a  screen pops up, you get paid, time moves forward you go home, the end. Combat is clunky and very easy to get stuck on objects, no story or ability to have conversations with people, simply hi, random line of writing thee end.It is a waste of your time and money even if the game was $5 dollars I wouldn't recommend it. It has no depth no story no point, you never feel as if you progress or gain any thing of worth. Its a shell of a game and one you will not lose anything by over looking.

It'd be much better if it had some of the aspects of the origional Stick RPG 2, Such as; Robbing Stores, travelling to other cities, selling drugs. All of these things could make it a masterpiece.Rating it 8/10, Recommended."

I work all day, go and study and spend more money than I make on school.  Get a promotion and start making some good money.  I have to put that money in the bank... oops, just gambled it all on Blackjack.  Go back to work begging for another promotion, no luck.  Want to drink my problems away but beer is too expensive.10/10 ... also I am thinking about going into crime now."

Though fairly simple and short, Stick RPG was a great game for its time. However, when Stick RPG 2 came out, it has improved upon evry aspect of the previous game.In case you might not have known, there are two versions of the game; There's the free browser version and the ""expanded"" Steam version. Though both have similar features, the director's cut gives you access to another area to explore, more jobs, full access to cheats that you would otherwise have to pay seperately for, etc( All the info is in the game's description I'll make it simple and list off the pros and cons of this game:Pros:-Combat plays similarly to Stick Arena: Ballistic (A game also developed by XGen Studios) which is not perfect but not bad at all either- A VAST number of jobs to choose from and max out-Several weapons at your disposal with varying ranks and tiers-each job has a certain benefit that sometimes can be useful-""Moral"" game (game let's you to either pick the good path or bad path)Cons-There are times where it stutters a little while transitioning to another area or to combat mode-Relationship feature is a bit lacking-Prices are a tad bit too highVerdict: 8.9/10;  This game serves to be a pretty fun time waster/RPG game. Though some aspects of the game are a bit annoying, you might not bother to notice it when you're strolling around the city, boosting your stats, and beating the living bejeezus out of each and every foe. If Stick RPG 3 is a possible thing in the future, I hope that XGen Studios can improve on making it even better than this installment."

Yes, it's a game in which you roleplay as a blue stickman, but it's also a game in which you can get drunk, beat up thugs, smoke crack, and defeat an insane plasma-cannon holding scientist. (Those events are why I nominated this game for the ""Game Within A Game"" award).In short, though, you're a blue stickman from another dimension who falls into the 2.5 dimension and can either:1. Find your way home with the help of the earlier mentioned mad scientistor2. Completely mess around in the game worldChances are you'll chose the 2nd option like me.The game has a large amount of jobs ranging from an Ice Cream Taster to a Kitten Exterminator and a large amount of activites ranging from finding endangered birds to fighting sewer people.Needless to say, I recommend this game for its wackyness and humor (similar to Saints Row IV), but like a lot of other reviews of this game say, please wait for a sale, for it is simply not worth $20.00.Score: 8.5/10"

It's complete in the actual content of the game, such as the story and quests, and provides huge replayability, or just very long single play. And it's still glitchy enough to add a huge amount of character and charm. Being able to moonwalk on command is always fun, and exploring the world presented is a huge joy every time. If you want to buy this, I recommend either waiting for it to go on sale, (Bought mine for $4), or play the free version first, and justify the $20 price tag. It is a quirky and charasmatic game, well worth the time to play it."
,Recommended,307640,33422926,Posted: 9 July,all,RiftAtom,"Honestly, I love this game. I played the free version way back when way too much and didn't even get far (other then beating it cause I grinded money), so it was awesome to buy the full version and find all sorts of new things. It is really dumb to have it priced for twenty dollars though. I waited till summer sale to buy it for eight and thats probably the max price I would put it at (or maybe ten). It would also be nice to have steam achivements, which shouldn't be too crazy to add since they already have trophies to unlock in game. It's still an awesome game nonetheless. I love the referances it makes and I still think Kate is the best wife because who doesn't want a smart girl? All of them are stick thin anyways. ;)Side note: If you get the triple bullet on the slot machine you get the doomsday glock. I didn't know that and I thought it gave me nothing. So later I went to buy it and found two in my inventory...Awesome game!"

Its an enjoyable fun expansion to a masterpeice of a flash game. I recommend getting it on sale (Or for free, xgen gives out steam keys for it on tehre twitter at times.) but the gameplay. The gameplay is as same as ever with expansions, in the directors cut you have access to buying companies in the game, a new home to buy, a new island for you access with premium places to improve your stick figures skill. But PERFORMANCE Issues. You can play this full screen but its not perfect, as theres a black box arround it and its impossible to change the video settings. One of the things I really dont like about this, theres no steam UI So if you want to talk to someone while playing it must be done minimized. But  really this is a fun and amazing game, I give it an 8.2/10. Worth a pick up if on sale.(Its five dollars on the mac appstore.)"

If its not on sale, don't bother with it until it goes on sale.Now don't get me wrong, the game is fun and all, but the thing is, Standard Price is $20. While I totally agree with supporting the devs, the amount you're paying for doesn't really justify the amount of content you get back. You get access to a few new jobs and like one side-quest/story. Everything else available in this game is available to you on the FREE version of this game which can be found on either Xgen Studio's website or a majority of other flashgame websites. Like I said the game is fine, but getting Director's Cut was quite disappointing. I didn't buy it at $20 but the amount of content I unlocked was....quite little. Sure a few cheats here and there, a few new jobs, a new quest and some other places unlocked. Was that all really worth the $20? I'd get it on sale if I were you. Maybe if this was some sort of bundle featuring their other games like the first Stick RPG (complete edition) or the Territory Wars series (with extra content?) and a bunch of their other hit games, sure $20 wouldn't be that bad. But for this game alone, sorry but not worth it.Another issue I have is, when you've logged in and loaded up a save, if its the wrong save, you can't reload saves while in-game. It'll ask if you want to overwrite instead and if you overlook this, you might overwrite the save you wanted to load up. The only way to load up a save is closing the game, booting it up and logging in again to select the save. I had to bring this up because I just accidentally overwrote a save file and well.....guess I won't be seeing that save file for a good while.Related to the previous point, theres no ""leave to menu"" button in general. The only way to access the main menu is to close the game.For some reason the same save file I loaded up seems to be missing a lot of progress even though I clearly remember unlocking the Castle and having a bunch of other job paths opened and maxed out.Also if you forget your account, there's no ""Forget Password?"" button so have fun figuring out your username/password or restarting from scratch all over again."
