Instead of money, you earn popularity points to spend on upgrading the park. All of the animals besides the beginning one must be earned through research.  Barebones, it is a zoo park--no multiple scenarios and limited amount of challenges to achieve.If you are looking for wonderful graphics, look else where. But it does have its own bit of charm, if you ignore the slightly annoying two-thirds angle. It feels more like it was designed to be a mobile game that was changed half-way through the production process.The big problems I have with it is my animals get sick soo easily, even if their habitats are clean. And the breeding program is annoying at best, with the first animals you buy will most likely never actually have any children before they become too old to do so.It has enough interest to keep me going for awhile, creating multiple parks. And for its price, it works. However, it wouldn't have been worth it if it was more expensive."

76561198111455049,Recommended,307760,19265544,"Posted: 25 November, 2015",all,PalominoLady,"I got this gamea few months ago, and although i have not spent that long on it, i felt i should write a review to try and counteract all the negative reviews this game has gotten.The first thing i want to say is no, this is NOT zoo tycoon. if its a zoo tycoon type game you are looking for, go buy and/or play zoo tycoon. This game is more an animal sancturay game than a zoo game. This means that you have to work harder to get to a good point in the game. not all the animals are available from the start, many you have to research. if you want to breed them faster, you have to research that, along with improved health, and if you wish to rehabilitate animals, and release them to the wild, you can again do this faster via research.There are not as many animal as in zoo tycoon, but there are still enough to keep you happy, and your sanctuary full. The exhibits you make for the animals are simpler than in zoo tycoon, which may make this game more youngster friendly, in that you simply choose the habitiat, how big you want the exhibit, and then place some trees, all of which are listed under the same habitats as the animals they are designed for. for example, if you want a lion, place an african exhibit, the some african trees. job done!  you can also place pools of water and rocks for animals which require them.It is much easier on this game to earn 'money' to buy new items, or spend on new animals or research, again making it a bit more friendly for younger players.there are some cons, in that alot of the animals do not live long enough to breed unless you have fully researched their faster breeding to 3 stars, so when they die you will have to pay out to replace them, but with the ease of money making in this game its not a huge problem.At the price its currently at, £4, i would highly recommend this game, its a fun, animal themed passtime, that is well worth the money!I hope i have conviced at least one person to try this game, overlooking all the 'this is not zoo tycoon' reviews."

At day 15, program began to crash every once in a while. Soon after, it crashed after only a few actions. No longer playable. Would have still recommended if it was cheaper but with all the bugs its still disappointing for the price tag. hopefully will be fixedIn addition, no option to reduce resources once your park gets really large. I have about 160 animals and 500 visitors and it takes way too  long to get through one day at the ""faster speeds"" (which end up being slower because of all the lagEDIT:Decided to recommend this game for the lack of good 2D simulators out there.

Only minor annoyance is animals get sick without warnning half the time as you fast forward.

Add an option to hide the plants and notifiy every time one gets sick and it's a good game to pass the time."

If you have played Zoo Tycoon 1 or 2 then you will be dissapionted with this game. Zoo Tycoon 2 is obviously much higher end in terms of graphics and overall gaming satisfaction but if you are a lover of simulation games related to zoos and managment then this is not a bad game to add to your collection. If I was a gamer that wasn't familar with either of the Zoo Tycoon games then this game would probably be a bit more fun because I wouldn't know any better. Not to dumb the game down, it is actually pretty complicated in some ways. Fun game for 5 bucks but don't expect too much. I really hope the Zoo Tycoon series eventually makes its way over to Steam one day."

I'm 20 minutes in and only have 2 animals in my park, both of the same species.This is NOT Zoo Tycoon, which is what I came in wanting, and expecting.This is NOT a budget version of Zoo Tycoon.This isn't even Wildlife Park, this is pretty much it's own game.Research plays a large role in the game- starting out, you're only going to have a base exhibit. You can't blow everything at the start and expect to make profits, you have to play it smartly, tactically. I know that sounds odd- you usually expect to blow everything on about 5 exhibits at the start, spend a lot of money on buildings and make your Zoo look nice.In this, you start with money, an exhibit, and some buildings. Good luck, have fun."

This game felt just like playing an old Facebook zoo games. Yeah you know which one..> But If you like me, who want to play advanced zoo that have 'this' feel that you're actually run your own zoo while edutace yourself about animals, then buy another game like Wildlife Park or better yet, the good ol' Zoo Tycoon.Get my self a refund luckily.

I'll start out by saying that I am a GIANT zoo tycoon fan. I've owned all of the games and all of the expansion packs. I could sit and play for HOURS on a zoo that literally had guests turned off and was just one big pen... but when I got bored of that I was just as happy playing the challenge mode or playing the game regularly. This game however... there's only one way to play it, and once you play it once, there's no reason to ever pick it back up again.For me this game feels absolutely bare bones. Six hours in to my gameplay and all I have to do is keep the game on fast forward and research animals that I don't have any desire to actually put into my park. I've already got every animal I want, have three stars into all three of their research categories, and I'm just... bored.At the stage of the game where I'm at, the zoo runs itself. My animals don't get sick, I very rarely have to buy new animals, and there's no incentive to keep expanding my park. The animals are dull and only run around and sleep. I'd love to see more in depth gameplay, where the animals do not inbreed (and add a pedigree system for keeping track of who is related to who), the animals fight, groom each other, socialize and play, etc. Literally the only thing I find myself doing is selecting new things to research, and after I do all of that, what else is there? Nothing.A few critiques:The rehabilitation side of things needs to be sped up. Even at 3 stars, I haven't rehabilitated a single animal and most I have tried have aged out before they were finished. Worst of all, what's the point? I can't find any good reason why you'd want to rehabilitate an animal if it takes their ENTIRE lifetime and takes one zookeeper out of commission until it's finished. Why not build in some challenges around it? Or an achievement system for rehabilitating 1, 5, 10, etc animals?Speaking of challenges, why are there so few? I only got two in a six hour span. Unfortunately they didn't seem like challenges though because they were very basic and I completed them in five minutes (then went back to being on fast forward x3 waiting for something else to happen).There is absolutely no indication on what animals need rocks, logs, and what shelters match with what animal. Why? And even when I did find something that seemed to match, the animals never used or interacted with them. Seems like wasted potential. Also, enrichment items please. Give the animals something to do other than running around and standing around. Make them play, groom each other, socialize, fight, etc.PLEASE add more guest features or decorative items. More fence types. Benches, more fountains. Themed items. Once you make a zoo, it is going to feel like every other zoo you make in this game because there isn't enough variation."

So far I'm only dissapointed by the customization. The options for customizing your zoo are limited (beyond simple diversity of creatures). I liked the aspect of zoo tycoon where you could make whole water gardens and really get creative. This game doesn't allow enough features (so far) for that to be a thing.Still, it's entertaining, and if you liked the origional zoo tycoon the controls will be quite similar. It would be very nice for children, provided they're at least at reading age.I'd wait for it to go on sale before buying."

Has a huge amount of research stuff, doing the animals and ""upgrading"" the animals is pretty satisfying. I like the fact that although the amount of areas isn't super huge, what you think may be short work is soon realized to take a very long time (gamewise) to unlock everything, lending to some very long term work. It may be a tad more simplistic than some bigger animal or zoo simulators, but I think that works out well, as this one can be a lot more casual while still leaving you ""lots of work"" to look foward to = a pretty good amount of playtime. Some might would call it boring but as a sim-game player I think it fits in nicely on the scale. Highly reccomend this one for casual but long term play. Since it can be ran in windowed mode, it can run while you do other things without TOO much worry about everything dying or going belly up. It's a well nice little game and doesn't deserve the mixed rating IMO."

It's pretty much a dumbed-down version, and it's basically styled like a mobile, time-based,  pay-to-play app (but without having to pay for things, fortunately). This may keep kids entertained, but it has zero of the strategy and chaos that made Zoo Tycoon fun for adults."

You don't get the major landscaping and customization options that the Zoo Tycoon series had.  There also is no campaign mode. But I can't complain much about lack of features when I only spent $0.99 on it. This game is pretty solid otherwise and I haven't encountered any bad gameplay.At the end of the day, I'm glad this exists so I don't have to pull out my old PC to play Zoo Tycoon... but I also ran out of things to do with this game very quickly."
