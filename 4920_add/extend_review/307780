Too bad most would have moved on to other fighting games like Tekken 7 and Injustice 2. Still a good game nonetheless. My only gripe is the lack of characters from the previous game (MK 9) and unplayable characters that you encounter in the story mode (i.e. Baraka, Sindel, Rain, Kabal, Nightwolf, Li Mei, etc).I'm hoping one day Netherrealm Studios would release an MK game that boasts the complete roster ala MK: Armageddon from the PS2-era days."

Locate the part that says ""DLC"", it should be right below the achievements.3. You'll see Install pack 1 through 20 something.4. Select all of them and they will begin to install manually.The issue here was steam's pre-load feature, it had nothing to do with the actual MKX game, so don't blame the devs. If you really want to play at the moment, that's how you can do it. Also if you could upvote this so people know what to do, that'd be appreciated."

It will never get the newest updates, such as KP2 or likely netcode. Do not purchase this game, and to save yourself frustration, NEVER purchase any NRS or WB games on PC again.This was my first and last time, and I will not make this mistake again. NRS on PC is the worst fighting game experience I have had on PC."
,Not Recommended,307780,19816245,"Posted: 20 December, 2015",all,Darkbleed,"Mortal Kombat is one of those franchises I will always cherish.  That being said, the pricing model of this game is atrocious.  There are decisions I agree with - for example, offering to allow players to spend money to unlock all Krypt items.  Not everyone enjoys unlocking.  The biggest ones I disagree with are the way the characters are sold.  It's almost like the game wants to be a F2P with microtransactions, except that it's not F2P because you have to drop $60 to get in the door.  The Kombat Pack kind of sort of is like a Season Pass, except it isn't because it leaves out Goro.  So you've gotta drop your $60 for the game, another $30 for the Kombat Pack, and on top of that you also have to buy Goro.  I'm assuming that if they release any more characters, you'll have to buy them as well.  Unacceptable business practice in my opinion.  Either make the game free to play and then nickle and dime players for specific content, or put a price sticker on all of the content that we pay up front and then give us the content.  For this reason, I am going to have to say not recommending this game.  It's a shame too, because it's otherwise a fantastic game.  But I refuse to support this kind of greed."

I still played over 100 hours hoping every day that it would eventually get fixed because surely they couldnt leave such a huge game as mkx broken forever.  Then the enhanced online and kp2 were announced and i was so happy that we would finally be getting the netcode that this game deserves.  Then I wake up today to find out that the netcode update is only on ps4 and xbone.  Well hopefully this helps anyone else who thinks about buying a game from wb studios or nrs on pc do not do it they will never support this platform.

,Recommended,307780,32037661,Posted: 29 May,all,IvanLeTerrible,"Mortal Kombat X is the latest entry in the MK franchise and boy, what a good game!I must confess that I stoped playing those games since MK 3 and only now decided to go back to them. Seems like Mortal Kombat 9 got criticized for its cartoonish character models, especially the female ones, so this time in MKX they tried a more realist approach, making characters look more like real people, with men looking not that buff and women looking not that busty. The result is that now the carnage has a real gory feeling, like if you are taking part in some kind of slasher movie, especially whe you perform one of the infamous fatalities and do crazy gory stuff with the opponent's body, like ripping their heart, cutting their head off and other even more macabre stuff.Single PlayerThere's a bunch of single player modes, so even if you don't play online you still gonna find the game fun anyways. The story mode in this game is kinda good, I mean, it makes sense and is entertaining enough without being too dumb. Thumbs up to Netherrealm for making a fighter with a decent story mode. The other single player modes are usually variations of the traditional ""towers"" found in usual Mortal Kombat games, and here you have a huge amout of those towers. The most fun are the so called ""living towers"" which provide you some kind of challege to increase the fight difficulty, like fighting while the screen is shaking or with lasers blasting both opponents and so on.OnlineThe only is kinda dead now, so you will only find random people to fight on weekends and such. Usually, to find an online partner, you have to call up someone on you friend list. That's how most of the online activity happens.PC portIt seems like when game was released, the netcode was broken and Netherrealm simply stopped caring about the PC version at all. Now all these problems were solved and the game runs fine on PC with all the content included.ProblemsThe problems with this game are only two, both gameplay releated:1- Fireballs and long ranged attacks are too overpowered. You can pick up certain characters and keep basically running away while apamming fireballs and the opponent can do little about it. Unfortunately, this seems to be a recurrent problem in all Netherrealm recent fighters. See Injustice 1 and 2, for exemple.2- The controls for the special moves are really messed up. Some follow the traditional MK style, like down, up + button, while others follow a more Street Fighter style, with quarter circle + button. I thinks it's time for MK to adopt only one style and get rid of this mess.Overall, it is a very good and solid fighterI rate it 4.8/5.0"

,Recommended,307780,28906664,Posted: 1 January,all,Benobeone,"I had avoided this due to the bad reviews down to its apparent abandonment on the PC platform by the developers. However, upon discovering that this had been rectified and due to the huge Christmas sale I bought it. So glad I did as, in my opinion this is the best MK game I have ever played.Its absurdly beautiful with superb animations.The arenas looks fantastic and the characters feel and react as if they are really within the scene rather than floating around on top, this is added to by some great arena interactions.There is loads of content and characters, although I would love to see the NPC characters such as Rain included.The story is actually really interesting certainly the most gripping I have encountered in this genre.But the fluidity, God! the fluidity of the fighting! its soooo good. To me MK games to be have always felt a little on the stiff side but not this one.Do yourself a favour and buy it, even if your too scared to go online and be shamed over and over.Just play the Story Mode or Towers and  then shame your mates when they come over.You will not be disappointed."

This port is truly a shambles and everyone involved with it should be erradicated off the face of the earth. Uninstalled the game and won't even think about installing it again. This game wasn't even worth the change down the back of the sofa, let alone £35. Absolute disgrace.First time writing a review. I say ""review"" but this is basically a complaint.This would be an amazing game (and probably is on other platforms) if the online was actually functional. The online component of this game was working flawlessly for me at launch. After the patches (which have been a shambles in of themselves) the online is barely functional. Constantly getting dropped from matches and the ridiculous level of input lag makes pulling off even the most basic combos near impossible.The offline modes work fine but the online is just not playable. Definitely not worth the amount I paid for it. I really want to be able to like this game but in it's current state it's just not possible.As I said the game itself is great, but this port by High Voltage is atrocious. Stay Clear until fixed (which is looking unlikely) or just buy it on another platform."

So, I have no need to enter into detail about this good well-known button masher, I'll just name a quick list of pro's and cons, if you are interested to take some of your time to read it.Pros:Good graphics, of course.Good ambient and story. I do suggest you to try the story mode, it's pretty interesting.Fast learning curve. You will spend most of your time on the floor, getting kicked in the head. But once you get a grip on controls, it's actually not that complicated to play the new MK. It's actually a bit easier than previous parts of the game.Online matchmaking actually works. And I can't be more happy about it. Even though I got my аss kicked in my first 10 online matches, it's still good. Previos part of MK supported online game veeeery poorly. This one is fine.It's a good game to play with your friends or alone, in your spare time. So, replayability value is good indeed.You get to play as Predator, Alien, Jason or Leatherface, if you get the complete package (It's not so expensive, so I do recommend to get this version of the game from start).Cons:The game is slightly graphics-heavy. So you won't be able to play it on your grandma's toaster.No chat or VoIp in online games, so you can't compliment or biтch-talk your opponent. But maybe it's a blessing in disguise.Krypt. Yep... The Krypt. It's actually well-made and fun to explore, I compliment devs on that. But if you want to unlock new finishers for your fighters and stuff, oh boy... You are entering the world of pain and infinite grind. Ooor... You could buy it for a couple of bucks as a DLC. And I think it's a bit of a diск move from dev's part, but maybe it's just me. It's not expensive, though, if you are tired of trying to save some coins to open another daмn tomb.Factions. Useless feature in my opinion. But it's just my opinion.So, yeah. I'd say that MKX is a good purchase and I do recommend you to buy it. You can play it on keyboard, if you do not have a controller. It's not that cosy, though, but possible. And if a price tag is a bit too much for you, wait for a sale and get it. You won't regret it. So, yeah... Good and fun game.8/10."

76561198220599868,Not Recommended,307780,27906810,"Posted: 27 November, 2016",all,LXQUICKJUSTICE,"I've enjoyed playing this game for a very long time, but instead of it feeling like a classic, I'm left with the same disappointment you can expect with pretty much every Mortal Kombat game ever made. The content is wonderful; that isn't the issue... The issue is the complete absence of character balancing and juggling gone completely off the rails. I know every fighter, and can execute almost all of their moves, but this game has serious issues when it comes to juggling. A better name for MKX would be 'Juggling Abuse Simulator,' because that's all every fight boils down to in the end. Some characters don't heavily rely on juggling, but they have absolutely no chance of beating those who do.For those not familiar with juggling, it is a method of keeping your opponent in the air for as long as possible, and being able to attack them without them being able to do anything to counter it. You only have one way to escape a juggle in MKX, which is your two bar EX breaker, but it won't help. The worst players in the world will spend their entire lives coming up with the lamest combos imaginable, ones that offer you absolutely no way out, and have infinite resets, so that when you DO finally hit the ground, they have a 50/50% chance of starting the combo on you once again. Since some of these ridiculous combos end up doing 50% damage... you can get the picture... That's basically it. I really like the game's content overall, and the fighting system is extremely fun... until you end up facing a juggle ♥♥♥♥♥, and you simply have no chance of winning unless you juggle ♥♥♥♥♥ them back... and I'd rather be doing something better with my time. Personally, when I do one of these combos on another player, I feel like a complete jerk, because I know how messed up it is, but don't expect anyone online to admit it.So, if you wanna drop a lot of money to have a good time... for a while... then go for it. I have certainly had my share of fun, but if you think you're going to use skill and actual fighting to win fights against juggle ♥♥♥♥♥s... think again. A prime example of this problem is Kotal Kahn compared to Takeda. Kotal has very slow attacks, and a slow projectile, but his combos do massive damage, as he is extremely difficult to use until you learn his moves. He is well designed. Takeda, on the other hand, has a lightning fast teleport, whips that can strike you and open combos on the other side of the stage, very fast, HUGE juggling combos, and a lightning fast low projectile. (can't be blocked unless you're crouch blocking) Can you guess who you'll be fighting online? Takeda. 87% of the time. It gets old after a while, as the game allows you no way to defeat a character that laughably unbalanced unless you do the same thing. Not even the ALIEN or PREDATOR has a chance, and in my book, that's very bad game design, and why I'm not recommending MKX despite enjoying it."

The gameplay feels excellent, like you're doing some serious damage to your opponent, the brutalities, x-rays and finishers are excellent but as a  whole it feels unfinished and NetherRealm is spoon-feeding you extra content for a price. This game has other issues aside from this, but this is my BIGGEST problem. Let's break this down.As of this review there are 5 pieces of DLC.Kombat Pack: £24.99.4 new characters (not including Goro), includes a themed skin pack for each, includes Samurai pack.Unlock all Krypt Items: £14.99.Unlock every item in the krypt (skins, moves, concept art, badges etc), rather than spending Kombat Koins earned by playing the game or throughmicrotransactions.Samurai Pack: £2.79.3 new samurai-themed skins.Blue Steel Sub-Zero: £1.59.Sub-Zero skinGoro: £3.99.Goro is playable, you unlock him if you preordered it also.Mobile App: £Free.Free mobile app to unlock skins that can only be unlocked via mobile. App isn't accessible in most regions including United Kingdom.This is insanity. Kombat pack is fine but overpriced, Unlock everything in the krypt is insulting, Samurai/Sub-Zero skin whatever, Goro was an incentive to pre-order the game.Other issues include the game being poorly optimised, it used to dip below 40fps in most stages but that's been fixed, hardly any game modes, not that many characters to choose from, not many stages. Without a doubt there will be a ""komplete edition"" with all the DLC bundled, you're paying full price for half a game, pay extra for the rest."

This is quite shameful and disrespectful towards their consumers, made all the more embarrasing since this is not only a good game but it could have been fixed and supported in which if they played their cards right it would bring more people into playing it.Long story short, this game has been abandoned and will remain incomplete compared to the console versions."
,Recommended,307780,30309852,Posted: 4 March,all,Da Phuc,"I know many don't appreciate long reviews but, it is necessary that I do so and go over some of the aspects of the game to remove your delimma of wether or not to buy this game.Don't just go on the overall user reviewsas they don't always tend to some individual's personal choices.GameplayThe gameplay is very fast paced and fluid, one of the many perks I enjoy. It has strong flexible combat, oh my bad,Kombat, and no playable character is too overpowered so as to not being able to kounter attacks, or block,etc. Although you might find most of the people using Scorpion as it is one the most easiest to use among all other characters (also that it is a on the cover poster of the game). All the playable characters have 3 different sets (with the exception of Triborg having a fourth one), the overall gameplay of a charater is same but each of the character type provides enough variety to play with and experiment. According to me this game has very good replayability, as it will easily take 50+ hours or so to completely master a player that too not entirely and come to think of it there are 25 players (where Goro was a preorder bonus, now added DLC) +8 DLC characters. Also the new level interactions added are very fluid in movement and use. The online lobby is a bit empty now, quite obvious as this game is already 2 years old, and mostly with experienced players, so you might have a hard time winning an online match.X -Ray movesThe game has become quite famous because of the X-Ray moves, it is one of the example of the utter gruesomeness this game has to offer, if you have not seen a X-Ray move of this game before, I say you go and take a look on YouTube, if you are comfortable with it (or even enjoy it) this game will do you good. (Psst.. wanna learn skeleton structure and play at the same time, this game is your perfect goto guide)Fatality/BrutalityHere we come to the most important part of the game, the finishers - Fatality/Brutality (Brutality has been added in this edition and did not exist earlier). This part of the game in its first installment was responsible for the birth of the ESRB rating. Although it were sprites that were used back then, now it is rendered graphics (And boy it looks yummy!), Go  check it out first if you haven't already, it is excessively gruesome. If you love it, don't read much further buy the game!(well do read cause you might not find paying for additional players satisfactory) The fatality is quite easy to execute compared to the brutality which require a sequence of moves to be done during the duration of the match in order to execute it successfully, but boy it is satisfactory.GraphicsThe game graphics are just marvelous, very realistic, bearing in mind it came out in 2015 (Please do not compare this statment to Crysis 3) The level design is very well done and the whole level as a good depth to itself. Even the texture details are well done. Also any blood splattered on the floor of the arena well be there till the end of the match. Compared to MK9 the human body is much more proportionate in this edition of the game. I recommend having a decently powerful machine (Please do not use a Potato PC) to enjoy the fluidity this game has to offer. Although it sucks that the game is locked in 60FPS.DLCI wouldn't say much over this point, but I would suggest that you buy the DLCs during the sale if you really want. I hate the fact that the MK frachise is trying to milk this game for money with DLC characters, so not happy here!ConclusionI really don't know what to say, if you enjoy fluid, fast, and gruesome gameplay, this is meant for you. If not then I really don't recommend it for you as you might just end up throwing up your intestines (actually happens in a Fatality)!"

,Not Recommended,307780,15445319,"Posted: 19 April, 2015",all,Real KCT,"Summary: Easy to learn, graphically fantastic, terrible online experience.Update 2: Over a month since my initial purchase on release. It's rare that a day goes by without steam trying to download between 500mb & 10gb of patches for this game. What it's patching I have no idea & I am certainly beyond caring. What a terrible release.Update: Since the latest 15gig patch I can confirm that the online now runs at 60fps.However, I have had repeated trouble connecting online matches with wait times over 2 minutes & have repeatedly seen King Of The Hill matches drop mid-fight. Leaderboards are still not reporting correctly & search parameters to find good connections are still non existant.-----Mortal Kombat X is a great looking game & compared to other titles in the fighting game genre, relatively easy to learn with forgiving controls & few mechanical systems to learn.While MKX doesn't have as strong a story as MK9, due to the extensive cinematic presentation, the story mode is far better presented than most other games of this genre. However, short of farming the game's inbuilt unlockable currency 'koins' to acquire additional costumes & concept art you probably wouldn't want to play it through more than the once. Completion of the story mode will average you around 5 hours max.As with all fighting games, the meat of the product is with the competitive VS mode.Locally as with the story mode detailed above, it runs at 60 FPS, looks amazing on max settings & as such the only lag for your input depends on your monitor or television's refresh setting & your system itself. Online is a whole different story & ultimately where the game (in its present state) suffers a real 'fatality'.As with MK9 before it & the PC release of both SFIV & KoF, the netcode is spotty at best, outright broken at its worst.The frame rate drops down to a locked 30fps for online matches, making all the combos & control inputs you learn locally in practice & story mode, completely worthless. Added to that an omni-present lag both in the character select menus & the combat itself & finally an inability to be able to search by parameters for ideal connections & you have an unenjoyable mess of a product. It's also worth pointing out that at the present time, even if you do can connect (or find) a ranked match, that the leaderboards for this mode are also completely broken.If you plan to take this game seriously at a FGC competitive level, you'd be best served getting the PS4 version as it's undoubtedly what will be used by organisers at tournaments anyway! Reports also state that the net-code on that system is comparatively problem free as it was developed in house by Netherrealm themselves, unlike this outsourced, seemingly second class PC version.Negatives aside regarding the online, If you just want to see where Mortal Kombat has come in the last 20+ years, there's a large variation of single player endurance & challenge modes & a trouble free experience of playing friends locally. Showing off all the outrageously gruesome fatalaties is likely to provide half an hour of entertainment during a game night at the least.It stands to reason, that when the most important component of a fighting game is in such a sorry & broken state, that I can't recommened the product."

I used to be heavily into Mortal Kombat, but stopped following the series sometime around Deadly Alliance.  The idea of getting back into the series seemed nostalgic and awesome.  I pre-ordered and anxiously awaited for it to be released.  I even upgraded my set up to the recommended specs to fully enjoy it.  When the game arrived, it was clearly not optimized for the PC.  There is a constant framerate stutter no matter what settings it is on.  There's also horrible online play that occasionally just refuses to work and won't connect to games.  Also, some features advertised for the console versions are just straight up missing in this.  It's clear the developers and the company responsible for the port just don't care about the PC community.

It should be illegal to straight up sell a product that doesn't work as advertised and not be able to get a refund for it.  You'll see many reviews telling you that it indeed works on other people's computers.  And indeed it does.  It's random.  No one in the forums can figure out why it works for some and not for others.  So if you really want to play Mortal Kombat X on PC, you just have to ask yourself if the price is worth the coin toss."

If you have friends to play it with it might be worth getting it right now but if you don't I would hold off for either an update or price drop.Current Issues my friends and I have ran into:Crash to desktop on leaving multiplayer matches sometimes, normally happens when we want to switch up who in the group we are playing against.Game will lock up sometime without actually locking up, it's almost as if it got stuck in some loop where by the game is responding but you can't actually do anything. Normally this is accompanied by a loading screen for online playGetting into a private match online is kind of hit or miss sometimes. I've had times where a friend invites me and after accepting it won't put me in the match and instead pulls him a random opponent despite the fact they chose private match.To build on the last point this happens more often in Towers and King of the Hill. We'll setup a private match and all of a sudden random person we didn't invite gets inSome of us are getting really bad frame drops on certain levels and that can generally be fixed by messing with settings but you have to go and edit a file to change some of them. If the setting actually exists for editing it should be editable in game. Honestly that just comes across as lazy, I'm not going to sit here and say that would be an easy thing to add because I have no idea what their code looks like but I was really hoping that would turn up in a patch by now.Faction related stuff is hit or miss sometimes it's up sometimes it's downBad match making, when we play against each other the latency is not an issue at all because we live in the same state but it seems when we do match making the game doesn't take into account the latency as well as it shouldGameplay wise the game is great and I highly recommend it if you are a fighting game fan but if you happen to have a PS4 or Xbox One perhaps consider getting it on there instead."

Not until when a new set of third-party developers came in does the game finally shine.If you're a fan of the series, you'll be plenty satisfied. Taking the lessons from the last Mortal Kombat game further, it's about a bone-snappingly appealing as is the gradually solidifying gameplay, that still has its own quirks. The story has a few surprises and is a visual feat, but does not have the crazy shocking moments that MK9 has.However,Consumer be warned.As of this and PLENTY of reviews below will attest, this is now officially the legacy port of the game. It will not recieve the upgrade to MKXL nor the Kombat Pack 2 characters. As a result, caution should be thrown as to how badly you wish to play this game of the series if you do not own either an XBone or PS4. That means no upgrade for the netcode (despite it being rather unfixed and still atrocious, even after multiple patches towards it), no further balance patch fixes, no extra anything.This game made me regret buying anything from WB Games and NRS.If anything else, and you still want a decent fighting game that will still get better support and already ran through beta tests showing that things will work for you and your system,get Street Fighter V instead.TL;DR version - I do not recommend anyone getting this from this point on."

Looks great, runs at 60 FPS (but the fatalities, X-rays and cutscenes are locked at 30 FPS) and sounds great. As for the game, it's a very good MK. Not as good as 9, IMHO, but it's very fun, has a polished gameplay and a very interesting story mode.HOWEVER...There's still one major problem with the PC port: the Netcode. For most people, the game is a PAIN to play online. Too laggy and unstable to be enjoyable. And the worst part: it seems like support for the PC port has been dropped by the publisher, and they don't even have the RESPECT to issue an official statement on WHY they dropped it.The new netcode that the console versions are getting is NOT planned for this PC version. In fact, a NetherRealm employer even stated in a forum that the new (and enhanced) version of MKX is planned FOR CONSOLES ONLY. We won't get the Kombat Pack 2 that was promised, we won't get the new stages, nothing!They are avoiding the PC community like a plague. They don't answer our questions, don't issue official statements, and don't even CARE about fixing the remaining issues (like gameplay balance!).After things like abandoning Gauntlet in a flawed state, releasing Batman: AK in THAT unplayable state, and what they are doing with us, I am done with WB Games. ¬¬"

The fighting is amazing and all the characters have three different fight styles. After playing as each character I must say it’s very well balanced.

The blood, sweat and mud/sand/snow (depending on the arena) all mix together in the middle of the fight making it really gritty.

You see a lot of characters from MK9 that you can't play as in 10 so that sucks a bit, but I must say, I did enjoy the story and I really got in to it.Overall I think this is an excellent fighting game and currently my favourite followed by MK9.

I have Madcatz Sf4 Sanwa stick, which works, but when I use this and a friend uses a xbox 360 controller (w/ wireless dongle), the button configuration aren't saved to individual profiles. If I save a button config to profile 1, then another config is saved to profile 2, it doesn't let us use the profiles. If I select profile 1, then player 2 selects profile 2, the game makes me use profile 2 also. Then if i switch to profile 1, it switches player 2 to profile 1. So if you use an arcade stick, I would stay away from this game. I do like it, but.......Why no PC patch since 9/2015. This game could be so good after some balances.

The game had a disasterous launch on PC if anyone remembers. Since then, some time has passed and, more importantly, some critical patches have come out. Here goes...First off, I am a fan of the MK series, been playing em since MK3. I think that MKX is a pretty good fighting game. The characters and variations are diverse and interesting. The game, in my opinion, is balanced well. The graphics are great especially in regards to character models and backgrounds. The fighting is fluid and has good animations. The story is serviceable. Its no Mass Effect, but I found it interesting(minus the stupid QTE). People who haven't played MK before should have no trouble understanding whats going on. Besides the story, you got stuff like klassic towers, test your might, etc. The Krypt also makes a comeback if you are into that kinda thing. They made it sorta like a minigame which I found to be ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. You have to run around and solve little puzzles to unlock regions with chests. Summing up, I would give this game an 8/10.So why do I not recommend it then? ONLINE MULTIPLAYER. Yes ladies and gentlemen, even after all the ♥♥♥♥♥ing and the patching, it still doesn't work properly. The lag simply makes online play impossible. This isn't some 3-5 frame lag like in USF4, your character behaves as if he/she injected 100cc of morphine and is struggling to stay awake. Simple combos that I can pull off with my eyes closed in practice cannot be performed online due to the lag. Multiplayer is such an important thing to get right in a fighting game. If you look at my ""time played"", 90% of that time I spent in practice/story/towers. The other 10% I was trying my best to play online. This usually defaulted to: play a couple of matches, get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at the lag, toss my controller across the room and turn the ♥♥♥♥ing game off. Matches are starting to take longer and longer to find. The rooms are pretty much empty most of the time except for Brazil for some reason.So basically, unless you want to play against the computer, don't buy this game. As for me, its a little late to get a refund xD. I'm definately not buying anything from Neatherealm on PC again though and same thing goes for those ♥♥♥♥ers at High Voltage."

But this port to PC is just beyond horrific and the launch of this game was beyond terrible. Don't get me wrong. I would buy this game a thousand times over...for consoles that is.First off, the port to PC...Even with grand specs, my computer can not run it without some hiccups. The best I can do is run it on 800x600 resolution with low quality, which gives me a steady fps. The x-rays are 30 fps, which i don't mind. What I do mind is suddenly when you do an x-ray, you notice that visual drop in fps.Now, the launch of this game on April 14...I was one of the ones that pre-ordered the game in hopes of it being a superior port to its predecessor (MK9). I pre-loaded the ~3 GB ""game"" and it asked me to download 29 DLC packages/patches. I looked at their explanation and it said you can play the game as it downloads, but do the developers not know that you can't download while in a game on steam? Of course they do. My guess is that, really the developers were not ready for a full release of the PC port on April 14.Slyly disguising an incomplete port in the form of DLC patches, they managed to sneak in the fact that DLC patches #5 and #9 were oddly missing from the full package on release day. And of course major features were missing such as story mode, faction mode, and general online play on release day. Furthermore is the fact that on April 18, a 15 GB ""Patch"" was uploaded. A 15 GB ""patch""? You might as well call that half of the game. I rest my case that this game was never ready on release day and was never meant to be released before it was ready. Even with the 15 GB patch, there are features missing. The netcode is still horrible. People lag out of online matches, especially King of the Hill.I understand turning this into a PC port is a quick buck, and hell you got my money. Even for the DLC, you got my money. But none of the DLC characters are actually available yet... The MK games are notorious for  bad PC ports. I mean, just look at the reviews for the MK series on steam. Just bad ports all over the place. This game is another shoddily coded Mortal Kombat game and has let me down. High Voltage, I understand you're work-for-hire developers, but just stop hustling PC gamers if you're going to do a shoddy job of a port."

Initially, the whole reason why this game's launch failed, was because of the stupid 20 part install thing they decided to try. That way you could play the game while the other parts are updating and installing. This didn't work, backlash ensued and then they decided to backpedal from that idea, which in-turn lead to them to fixing it. This was all before we even found out about how bad the netcode was! The netcode was awful! It has gotten a bit better as of late, but it won't be getting any better in the future. I did have fun with this game, but then again the kampaign portion of it was predictable and infuriating with some of the events that unfold. Also for the first time ever I do believe, they added QTEs in a MK game... QTEs. This was more of an annoyance rather than a rewarding thing, hell it was practically just slapped in there. Missing the QTEs had no consequence whatsoever, none, not one bit.Worst of all though, this game has been practically abandoned. We're not getting the Kombat Pack 2, we're not getting the better online play, we're not getting the famous original MK map The Pit. These things are all exclusive to the PS4 and the Xbox One. From what I have experienced from WB though, is that the word exclusive means nothing to them. For instance, Arkham pre-order exclusives eventually coming out as purchaseable DLC for $5~. So maybe we might see these updates and the Kombat Pack 2 in the future, but I'm not holding my breath.Ed Boon might not be the one to blame for this, but the man made such a bold statement stating, ""It'll be just as good as the consoles."" Well it isn't, and probably won't be. So no, I do not recommend this game, and this is one of the first main titles in the series I don't recommend. Honestly I won't be satisfied until this game is removed from Steam. This game is basically a money making scam now, it has been abandoned, and is still at full price. Go buy another fighting game, or get this game on a console. Honestly though you shouldn't have to buy this game twice, it's wrong having to."

I often get messages that Faction related gameplay is disabled due to server connection failure.

Also, note that I'm leaving out a lot of other issues I've experienced.  Even after a 15 Gb (yes, giga) update, we still need more fixes.If you have a PS4 or Xbone, buy MKX for that instead.  I had read bad things about the company responsible for porting the PC version, but I gave them a chance.  I had hopes that fighting games could be given a chance on PC with this game.

That is, I would really be enjoying the faction system if I could ever connect to the faction server. The graphics optimization is pretty bad, with twin 780 TIs not even being able to run the game in 4k with everything else at minimum settings. For these two reasons, I can't give the game a positive review. Fix those two things and you'll win me over.Edit: Recent update (Tanya) made the single GPU performance a lot better. I can almost play the game in 4k at high settings on a single 780 TI now. Unfortunately, due to the lack of a working SLI profile, the only way to get SLI working is to use some hacks which introduce some artifacts. I would imagine at this point a single gtx 980 or r290x could run this game at max settings in 1440p but I don't have either of those cards to test. I still need to test for a week to see if the faction server availability has improved much. Hopefully they add an SLI profile at some point so I can turn this review into a recommendation."

Meaning all is for naught, and any favorites you had from previous games which are absent here are barely compensated for. Sure the addition of character variations fill the gaps for fighters such as Jade or Noob Saibot, but if you were holding your breath for Cyrax or others - then you are out of luck. As of this time WB has discontinued all support for this version of the game, which includes no releases of future DLC. DLC with characters which should have been in the game from the get-go, but cut out because otherwise people wouldn't buy it I imagine.It has a very good framework for a Mortal Kombat title, but it gets suffocated by bad decisions on the side of the publisher.It's a husk of a game, either wait for a ""Komplete Edition"" or go back to Mortal Kombat 9."

Everything else is worse.While the colourfulness and tongue-in-cheek atmosphere of mk2 translated well in mk9, mkx has the dark and grim atmosphere of the original mk1. I don't mind that personally, but they also got all the sluggishness of that game too. So dare i say that was a whong direction?Astonishing amount of resources were reused in this game. The animations and moves were ripped from their previous games almost untouched. This includes Injustice, MK9, and even MK vs. DC Universe(Yeah, remember that one?). But not only that, the game has characters in story mode, that are identical to those of mk9, but can't be played without using mods. They are fully playable mk9 characters that can't be played. New characters, appearance of which may seem new and fresh to some, still can be rehashing year old animations and moves. And while it's almost impossible to bring something new to the genre, simply reusing something year after year can't satisfy the need for novelty of seasoned folks. Speaking of new characters, the only one that i believe is worth mentioning is Tremor. Which is very sad, considering he is not really new to the series and is a DLC character. As is Jason Voorhees(2009 variety), who probably has singlehandedly sold few hundred thousand copies of the game, while being arguably the worst character in the game from competetive standpoint.The game's launch was a failure on PC. HVS were the ones making this version. And while they did(again, arguably) a recommendable port of mk9 and Injustice, it seems that the time and talent was scarce for making MKX for PC a decent product. After the torturous launch, about 3 month to be exact, the patch came out, dealing with particle physics being a mess, making the game almost unplayable. So there was 3 months of time when the console gamers happily played the game, while at the same time PC playerbase was literally dying. As of now the game has a daily peak of 1k players. And it will be going down some more.So on his twitter Ed Boon, the director of this game, announced that he finally have succumbed to a better netcode. The netcode that is being used by a plethora of fighting games(fightcade, rising thunder, SFxT, SFV to name a few). And while this might seem as great news, because mortal kombat needed a better netcode for years, the bad news certainly do outweight.The long awaited Kombat Pack 2 as well as new rollback netcode will not come to PC. After some time of corporate silence on the matter, the PR guy(or some♥♥♥♥♥♥like that) gave in and told us the truth. Updates for this game are now console exclusive. After the failure that was this port, NRS have fired HVS, and now there is no people to work on this version. This is now literally a dead game. And not even a year have passed since it's release.Don't forget 'ez' fatalities and krypt unlocks for money, slowing down the koin gain from fights, and deleting save files for a patch.♥♥♥♥ NetherRealm studios, ♥♥♥♥ Ed Boon. I suggest boycotting any their new products from now on. Another PR failure for WB."

To be honest with you, I am not a real fan of this type of game. I do own a couple of titles (including Mortal Kombat 9) but rarely play them.What impressed me on my first attempt was how easy the controls (moves) were to master which to me was a massive plus. From this, I jumped into the story mode and was just blown away by this game, from the cinematic scenes to the game play!At first, you will have to choose one of five factions to join (you will have challenges to achieve on a daily basis to help your faction ranking). After choosing one faction, you will be directed to the game menu where you will be able to select a mode of play.  You will have several options: one player, two players and online mode.Each fight you win, you will get coins (this will vary upon successful combos) which you will be able to use in the Krypt section to unlock plenty of gizmos by opening tombs. My suggestion to you is to amalgamate as many coins as possible because the krypt is fairly big and has many tombs to ravage.Mortal Kombat X has absolutely splendid graphics, runs smoothly and the controls are easy to master.Positives:~~~~~~~~-	Splendid cinematic scenes (story mode)-	Great control system-	Very addictive-	 Plenty of achievements-	Trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~-	Big download but well worth itFun, addictive, visually grandiose, just a cracker of a fighting game!10/10MORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HEREFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE"

HVS somehow managed to take one of the most well optimized, well scaling engines (Unreal Engine 3) and turn it into a steaming pile of stuttering dropped frames that can barely run even on recommended specs. Combine the poor performance with loads of crashing, freezing, scumbag DLC moneygrubbing and microtransactions and you have the worst Mortal Kombat to hit PC... ever. Oh, and the netcode is virtually unplayable. Well done, NRS, HVS and WB!As for the actual gameplay? Read on if you're a fighting game fan:The game is full of unreactable overheads and most characters have devolved into 50/50 coin-flippers. Intelligent gameplay requiring you to condition your opponent to open them up is now replaced by cointosses thanks to the unreactable nature of certain mixups. For casuals this is a godsend because it means they don't need to think or work for their damage. For hardcore fighting game fans it means you can be destroyed by less intelligent, less practiced opponents because you are literally given no chance to react to certain attacks (for example, Reptile's overhead).There are already infinites being discovered and posted on YouTube because NRS doesn't understand how framedata works. This is a party game, not a serious competitive game. If you take it too serious you're going to be let down.The only good thing about the game is the art and animation. For that I give it a 1 out 10 instead of a straight up 0.AVOID ON PC AT ALL COSTS! THEY ARE NOT PATCHING THIS GAME! PC IS SEVERAL PATCHES BEHIND CONSOLE AND HVS IS NOT COMMUNICATING ON STEAM!"

I was so hyped for the game that I went out of my way to play this proparly, even making the mistake of preordering.This is the Fighting game that I was going to take seriously, I bought a controller just so I could get the most out of it.I wasted so much money on this game that it single handidly made me never pre-order another game ever again.All the problems that were present at the release (and what a clusterf!ck that was) are all gone or ironed out and it runs really well now. But WB Games has dropped ALL support for the PC version, so this will always be an incomplete game. No features that's present in the console version and no improved netcoding so why even bother with the online multiplayer?I'm also not a huge fan of the direction they seem to be taking some of the characters.Some character have the best designs they've had yet (Like Scorpion, Reptile and Kitana) while some just got really stale and boring (Like Sonya, Johnny Cage and Mileena among others)They also seem to be pushing some sort of diverse ""Young Justice Leauge"" type of team for the new human characters and for the most part it falls flat on it's♥♥♥♥♥ they are boring, stale and quite frankly feels really one dimentional. At best Cassie Cage and Takeda are fine, they're atleast funny while the rest might aswell be set peices and have the worst character designs out of all the characters, there's nothing special or unique about their designs and that's bad when they're clearly suppose to be the focus or ""take over"" after their parents, its also really bad for a game like Mortal Kombat that's had really interesting and good character designs.If you're interested in just playing the single player or have people that you can couch vs against then by all means, there's enough content to keep one happy with that.

Despite that the beta version was quite fast when playing online but this new main version or update for the PC is as slow as the previous main version like MK X. What a shame and a waste of money! It looks like a partial scam since the beta version of MK XL had fooled many people into believing that the netcode was already fixed and not just about adding more characters or features to the game in this major update like kombat pack 2 or mk xl package. Many of these online matches ended prematurely due to extreme lag and it is very difficult to control the character and of course not to mention the cheaters who constantly spam never ending long combos with macro or by exploiting poor game design that allowed exaggerated long combos with high damage together with infinite juggling effects so opponents could not block or almost cannot do anything to counter such attack. It is also possible that some could lag their opponents by sending high packets of data by using flooder or hack tool and this is unacceptable. Also, I'm currently using Radeon RX 480 4 GB GDDR5 so there is no reason for the game to lag or run very slow when playing online so it's the game that still have poor netcode. For the moment, I could not totally recommend this game for anyone who is on PC platform and I'm certainly not going to give a high rating until they fix this game otherwise it would still be kinda unplayable online except for the single player mode.OLD UPDATE: Finally upgraded to MK XL! But.... stuck at Reading Stats Data for gaining acess to online match which still made this game unplayable online. Reading Stats Data seemed to be taking forever to the point that I had to exit the game. Even worse is that steam cannot exit MK XL. Looks like it is still new and buggy so it needs to be patched in the future. I also wished that the Kombat Pack 2 was free for people like me who had bought MKX Premium Edition but sadly, it was not free at all. Unfortunately, I had to buy XL Package which included Kombat Pack 1 that my Premium Edition already has it since strangely, it is cheaper than Kombat Pack 2 so it makes no sense and looks like a rip off. Above all, I still cannot give a good rating for this game unitl this issue of Reading Stats Data is fixed.OLD ORIGINAL REVIEW: Unplayable for PC Gamers. The Game designers had already performed a FATALITY against this game so this game is now kinda dead. They had just nailed it right into its own coffin. There will be no future support like better netcode and there will be no future DLC for PC platform. Single Player Mode is fine but as long as they discount the price for the PC on Steam. If they do not discount the price then I would not recommend anyone to buy this game. Luckily that I bought this game during Christmas when there was over 60 percent discount of its original price otherwise I would be getting this dead game without future online support at a full price. I was waiting for discount also due to its poor/mixed reviews on Steam. Please note that multiplayer mode is kinda unplayable and extremely slow to the point that the game froze and crashed back to game's room or menu. There were only 3 matches out of like 72 matches that I managed to truly finished online which are only 6 rounds total so this means that I almost cannot even finish at least a single round per match in almost entire game when playing online due to poor netcode which crashed the game often and caused bad sync while playing. Imagined, almost not being able to control your character during fight or not being able to get your revenge before the game freeze and crashed back to the menu or room. Its very frustrating and disappointing. What a shame that they cannot port this game well to the PC."

Let's get a few things out of the way.MKX is a solid fighter. It's pretty, it's fun. Has a great personality and challenges you to do better as a person. It makes you want to BE better. However, MKX has major daddy issues. MKX was broken. It had a hard upbringing, and was never fully loved for what it was and instead was rushed into maturity. You couldn't fully trust MKX.I pre-ordered this game and bought the Kombat Pack season pass as soon as I was able to. First game since Halo 2, on the legacy Xbox, that I pre-ordered. Upon the dysmal release, I couldn't play the game for several days thanks to the ""play-as-you-go"" installation. But I forgave the powers that be and tried to be understanding that sometimes♥♥♥♥♥♥happens. Many players gave up and moved onto console where the game worked, but I had faith that the game would be fixed. And given time, it was.Then an update to Steam nuked my game install. I had to download all 30gb of the game once more, which on a rural internet connection takes quite a bit of time to do. Then I had a patch delete my game saves, forcing me to start afresh and grind my way back to where I was. Even still, I tried to be understanding.Eventually, all the performance issues and bugs were fixed. PC was getting updates a week at the most after console. All was good. As MKX is now, aside from the netcode which could be better (more on that in a minute,) it's good. It runs great. It's tight. It's pretty to look at in 1800p which my now old R9 290 runs at a constant 60fps. It's just a good fighter.However...WB recently announced that PC will NOT be getting the new netcode. It will NOT be getting Kombat Pack 2. They WILL be dropping PC support from now on. This also goes for balance patches.Nine months after release, a game I spent close to $100 on and planned on dropping another $25 for the next season pass, is now unsupported.Can I recommend this game?If you would have asked me yesterday, January 21st, 2016, I would have said yes. In a heartbeat if you enjoyed fighting games.Now? A resounding, ""Nah, bro. Buy it used on console if you have to play it. Otherwise, don't bother.""Never again, NRS. Though the PC fanbase is small (no doubt due to the horrible launch and patching issues) we still were fans. We still played. We still enjoyed your game, despite all the crap that HVS put us through. The netcode improvement alone would have likely seen the return of many burned early buyers, but you essentially shot yourselves in the foot and blamed the gun for your terrible aim.MKX, it was a fun ride. I love you. It's not your fault. It's just your daddy issues, man. I'm tired of it.You do you, babe. You do you."

,Recommended,307780,25862934,"Posted: 4 October, 2016",all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"Mortal Kombat is a long-standing series known for its notorious amounts of blood, gore, and violence; more specifically, its unique Fatalities other end-match sequences that revolutionized the fighter genre. From the first installment, released in 1992, until now, the franchise has had its ups and downs in terms of releases. Ushering the series into a new generation of gaming is Mortal Kombat X, which launched in April of 2015 and upgraded to Mortal Kombat XL for PC on October 4, 2016 (March 1st, 2016 for consoles).The Past: To put it lightly, MKX had a horrible launch for PC. The initial download only included the title screen of the game, leaving thousands of players locked out of the juicy content that laid within. Once that was fixed, a bombardment of poor patches kept breaking the game even further; one map had such poor optimization that it saw 15-20 FPS, another map was completely pixelated, it was almost impossible to finish an online match due to disconnections, the Living Towers wouldn't load, MKX Mobile rewards wouldn't unlock... the list went on and on. Finally, Warner Bros abandoned the PC port, leaving thousands of fans not only disappointed, but furious.The Present: Warner Bros picked MKX back up during the middle of 2016, starting out with beta testing to ensure that all issues were being dealt with properly. With the release of MKXL, character balance, netcode, and optimization issues are supposedly fixed. After giving the game another try since the update, I am happy to report that the game runs great. Quitalities work now, the game runs at a flawless 60 FPS on all maps without any pixelation, and connection to not only opponents but the WBPlay network is strong. You now are obligated to run a benchmark prior to playing online, and when connecting with other players you can see both their PING and FPS rating.Mortal Kombat X is the first game in the series to feature three different fighting styles per character. Whatever your play style may be, most characters have one to accommodate you; whether you are offensive, defensive, or a mix of both. Each fighting style comes with its own set of moves, and most of them incorporate both old and new moves for each specific person. This installment has also seen the return of X-Ray moves, first seen in Mortal Kombat (2011), which are powerful meter based specials that unleash a deadly, bone-breaking assault on your foe. Each character has 2-3 Fatalities, 5-6 Brutalities, the ability to perform Stage Brutalities and Fatalities, as well as Faction Kills, and if an opponent quits on you online then you get to see a Quitality. The new XL pack has also introduced new Klassic Fatalities.Another newly introduced feature are Faction Wars; a continuous, affiliation-based Multiplayer mode. At the start of each week, you can choose to either ally yourself with the White Lotus, Special Forces, Black Dragon, Lin Kuei, or Brotherhood of Shadows. You can complete three challenges each day to earn points for your Faction, as well as simply play the game to level up within it, and at the end of the week the Faction with the most points is declared the winner and awards are given based upon your contribution during the week. As well, you can level up your tag and complete tons of prerequisites to unlock new borders, icons, and backgrounds for your multiplayer tag; similar to the Injustice: Gods Among Us tag system.With 13 arenas, most of them having two versions, there is no shortage of visuals to take in as you're massacring your foes. The game looks absolutely stunning, with plenty of foreground and background material to take in; a lush jungle, a snow covered landscape, a shipping dock. All of the characters are even more impressive looking, never have you seen the cast of Mortal Kombat in such vivid detail. But really, who am I kidding? It's the blood, guts, and gore that's the greatest part of MKX. Every fatality is just as brutal, if not moreso, than the last, coming with tons of shock value at just how unique, disgusting, and realistic-looking they are. Take it from someone who has been playing this series for two decades and has seen every single Fatality, the ones that NetherRealm thought up for this game are the most sinister to date. Prepare to feast your eyes on tons of entrails, organs, blood, and bones; this is one game that will satiate your lust for carnage.There's no shortage of modes to play, either. Rather than focusing on just one ladder to climb within the single-player arcade, there are a variety of towers to tackle. Traditional Towers include Klassic, Test Your Might, Test Your Luck, Endless, and Survivor. Living Towers have ladders that change weekly (Premier), daily, and even hourly; each one of these comes with its own special challenges and modifiers to create diverse experiences, no two towers are ever exactly the same. Lastly, Challenge Towers are randomly generated ladders of five opponents with random modifiers thrown in the mix; once you beat one, you can send the challenge to your friends, and vica versa. If you're in the mood for online play, take your pick between King of the Hill, Team Battle, Tower Battles, 1v1 Versus, and 1v1 Ranked.Taking place two years after the events of MK2011, the story mode is a fantastic continuation of the current alternate timeline of the MK universe. I won't say much of it here as I don't have the room and I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but if you're in to MK lore then you will definitely want to play this mode before anything else. The Krypt is also back and bigger than ever, taking on a first-person, grid-based movement style. There are hundreds of unlockables, from concept art to new Fatalities, Brutalities, costumes, music, icons, and more. It also has a small story to it, and you must find certain character's items in order to progress further through the different levels of the Krypt; it is time consuming, and it takes hundreds of thousands of Koins to purchase everything.All in all, Mortal Kombat X is one of the best and bloodiest entries into the series. Let's put past mistakes and grievances behind us, as Warner Bros have made amends and righted the wrongs that were previously plaguing this title; although it would've been nice if they gave the XL content to us for free, but we all know they need the money. In terms of mechanics and balances, it's a solid fighting game. Players still find exploits, such as infinite wall combos and Leatherface's horrible chainsaw, but that's a given in virtually every fighting game. The fighting is fast, fluid, and frenzied, and there are multipliers that can make it even quicker and crazier. In terms of sheer brutality and bloodlust, Mortal Kombat X will give you all of the blood, guts, and gore that your demented little heart craves.Rating:5.0/5.0- An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

It's probably one of my favorite if not my all time favorite fighting game of all time, but NRS and WB did something that infuriated me.Backstory: When MKX was first released on PC about a year ago, this game was broken beyond measure on the PC. No one could get past the title screen and crashes were frequent. Since then, all of the problems have been fixed. We could play it normally just like Xbox and PS4, and for a while everyone was happy. And then the Kombat Pack 2 and MKXL was announced. I was so hyped for this. The new characters, Leatherface, Bo Rai Cho, Alien, and Triborg all seemed amazing to me. I watched all the Kombat Kasts, checked the news on a daily basis for the new characters, and then someone who works at NRS states that MKXL and Kombat Pack 2 will only be available for Xbox and PS4, not for PC. There were a number of things that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, some of them being:-We don't get Triborg-We don't get Alien-We don't get Leatherface-We don't get Bo Rai Cho-We don't get the Pit map from MK9-We don't get the extra brutalities and fatalities-We don't get new netcodeSeriously. What. The. ♥♥♥♥. It seems NRS is quitting on us fans after tirelessly working to fix the PC problems. They hired these incompetent morons to port the game into PC, and since it didn't work, I heard the company responsible for porting it was fired, and I hope to god that's true, because they are one of the main reasons PC didn't get this sweet deal.As a long time MK fan, to say that I was disappointed is a huge understatement. This marks the last time I EVER pre-order another game again.Edit: Sept. 10, 2016. So apparently MKXL and Injustice 2 may come to PC after all. All I can say is, too little too late. Maybe I'll get Injustice 2 because I'm a huge fan of both game and comics, but I will never play MKX ever again."

This game didn't release on launch. They decided to try this new fangled way of giving us the game (Letting us download a base version of the game and installing the rest as we played) and that utterly failed. The DLC packs for the rest of the game didn't even show up until the following day.I also have no idea why you hired the same people who screwed up your last two ports to PC to do this one.Game also barely functioned on launch (Functions now, I guess) dlc characters and patches were always late and now it finally comes out that we're not getting KP 2 or the enhanced Net Code.I guess I understand that we're not worth it, since the MKX community isn't that big but ya know, if you didn't ♥♥♥♥ up every conceivable damn thing about this port, maybe there would be a stable player base on PC.

,Not Recommended,307780,15716027,"Posted: 6 May, 2015",all,Neith (SectionSkyly),"UPDATE AS OF 24/01/2016: DO NOT BUY MKX ON PC. THERE IS NO FUTURE CONTENT AVAILABLE FOR THE PC VERSION. I will personally be boycotting any future NRS/WB titles and I would encourage anyone else who bought this to vote with their wallets.Mortal Kombat X is the successor to 2011's Mortal Kombat 9 which rebooted the franchise and undid some of the damage that the terrible PS2 games had done. It made itself known as a viable competitive fighting game and after both this and Injustice, Netherrealm began to gain credibility for their games.As a long time Mortal Kombat fan (going back to MK1 on the Amiga!), I was hyped for MKX like many were. Now that the game has been out a few weeks, here's my rough thoughts:What's good?+ Fully featured cinematic story which follows on from the events of MK9+ Large cast of playable characters both new and old, including relatives of former characters+ Beautifully presented+ Tutorial is basic but does show you everything you need to fight at a simple level+ More ways to make a mess of your opponent than ever before with 2 Fatalities per character and around 5 Brutalities per character as well as Quitalities if someone bails on you online. Fatalities and X-Rays look more gruesome than ever before and a couple do make you feel genuinely sorry for your opponent+ Intuitive combat engine with multiple options to let you customize the experience.+ Tons of different modes to play so you won't get bored, including a Krypt which is almost another game in itselfWhat's bad?- The PC port is very poorly optimized. There are numerous crashes, frame drops, issues connecting to online, the list is almost endless. High Voltage Studios are somewhat well known for bad ports (MK9 port took a while to sort out but see Zone of the Enders HD if you want to read up on HOW bad it can get)- Sky Temple in particular is almost unplayable for some people. I run the game on a i7 4790K with a GTX660 and I had to drop the resolution to 1280x720 in order for Sky Temple to run even remotely smoothly.- People's saved games seem to randomly delete. This hasn't affected me personally and HVS have claimed to fix it but I can't guarantee anything.- Not a current experience: By this I mean we're behind the console versions. There were balance tweaks (such as fixing Ermac gaining meter too easily in Mystic) that have been active on the console versions for a little while but PC is only getting them more than a week later. This means even if you were competitive you couldn't use the PC version to practice on because you're effectively playing an outdated version.I'm not going to comment on the online play- it's been so temperamental since launch that it hasn't even been worth trying.To keep this somewhat short:Should you buy MKX?Yes, absolutely...but do yourself a favour and buy the XBox One or PS4 versions (which are purely done by Netherrealm). Don't waste your time and money with this port. Honestly this is the worst PC game launch I have ever seen.Update as of 24/01/16: Tyler Lansdown at Netherrealm has now confirmed that Kombat Pack 2 and the improved Netcode will NOT be arriving on the PC version of MKX. If you still want to play this get a used copy of PS4/XB1, do NOT buy the PC version if you care for any future updates. Absolutely disgraceful show by WB/Netherrealm. Don't buy a new copy; these guys don't deserve the money."

High Voltage Games is incompetent, plain and simple. It takes a lot for me to outright say that about anyone, but this *well* exceeds that requirement.

The fighting mechanics feel so smooth, and there's always something new to learn.The story is pretty decent with interactive cut-scenes, and great voice acting. Though very short, beating the game will unlock Shinnok to use in Multiplayer. The game has a 3 variation system for each character, where your movesets change from each variation. Some variations are just not worth using, because there is just one variation that makes the character the best. My main character is Kano Commando, but his Cutthroat variation is just better overall because of safe 50/50 mixups. Commando is like Cutthroat, but instead of 50/50 overhead/lows he has command grabs, which I prefer more because his moves are less boring than Cutthroat. Commando is also fairly underused, which I appreciate more.The multiplayer is great. Mainly the new netcode that NRS put out makes lag less troublesome during the match. I rarely have crashes or disconnects since the latest patch. I'm running on a 5-year old CPU and a brand new graphics card and I get a smooth 60 FPS across the board on High settings.My RigWindows 10 Home 64-bitIntel Core i5-2500k CPU  @ 3.3 GHz8 GB GDDR3 RAMNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3 GB VRAM700W Corsair PSUThe DLC for the game is okay.

I think you will get your money's worth with the XL edition considering you receive all the DLC characters and extra content for a very low price.Overall, this is the best Mortal Kombat game I've played so far.

,Recommended,307780,31320367,Posted: 23 April,all,Bomb Has Been Defused,"Alright, so Mortal Kombat X was an amazing game at the beginning and still is! The problem that I see is that whenever I go online, I can either never find a match, or I find someone who acts like he plays 24/7 and hits me with 13 hits in a combo. This makes me hate the game very much, although it is just because I don't practice enough. Another thing that bothers me which was added a while ago, was the Kombat Pack 2. It is 20 dollars for 4 characters, kold war skin pack, goro, and 2 classic fatality packs. Everything here is previous content besides the four characters introduced in this. I have all the items in pack 2 from before kombat pack 2 was realised. If I were to buy it, I would have just used twenty dollars for 4 characters really. Same thing when you buy the characters by itself. It literally is 4 cents cheaper just to get the four characters. I understand this is how the game makes money, besides actually buying the game, although it is just very bothering that it is twenty dollars. A lot of people will disagree with me and attempt to lecture me on this, but I am ok with that. Share your opinons if you would like to do so. Anyway that is just the dlcs and the online gameplay. The actual game itself is amazing. The story mode is very nice to play, although some parts can be annoying. I really enjoyed the game when I first started out on story mode. Then I moved on to practicing combos. What I learned is that the keyboard is very hard to do combos in practice mode and singleplayer. I also find that many people use controllers, so I plugged in mine, and the combos would mess up considering when you actually perform something as (up down left right) it would mess up and for example, register this move. (Up down slide) This didn't bother me so much, since I got used to it. It really didn't happen often, but it happened when I needed it most to not happen. Next, the practice. There isn't much to say, except it is fun to actually spar with bots and practice your combos, fatalities and whatever the fatalities are called before you kill them. Like you don't drain their health and you perform something to do a cool fatality. Anyway, a cool feature I noticed on practice, the hard and very hard mode, the bots can stick 8 hit combos, which really interested me to get better. I haven't played in a while, so don't judge me if this was implemented a long time ago. Really the game is amazing, apart from the difficulty of finding matches, the cost of characters, and how there isn't like a skill thing to implement who you fight against. I understand why it's a good and a bad idea. The good idea is that you can fight people your own skill level, and actually hope to enjoy the game, with no rage if you win, and feel normal if you lose. The bad thing is how iit would take quite a good amount of time to actually implement this, and people would forcefully derank themselves by losing matches, just to fight against people worse at the game then them. Anyway I hope this review was helpful, and have a great day."

Though it is fun regardless of what platform you buy it on, there are far less PC than console players online, and we will likely see no real attention to the PC platform from Warner Bros. It sucks because it is truly a fun game, but that's WB for you. TBH if you want a fun MK game on PC get MK9. It is at this time half the price of this game, and it is way better configured for PC.

76561197981584030,Recommended,307780,34027647,Posted: 4 August,all,Celendrin,"quick preliminary review -Short - fun but potentially frustrating (due to strange controls and combos along with obvious unfairly over-powered characters) game that has excellent graphics and sound, and multiple game modes.Note internet connection was fine no issues other than the obvious internet ping and your own computer graphics limitations.Long -No internet lag/connection problems (relatively speaking), multiple game modes along with King-of-the-Hill's, player matches, ranked matches, rooms etc.Overall somewhat fun game but, - As Always for Nether-Realm Games -- > there are overpowered characters (usually bought..) who have incredibly superior movesets to the 'normal' types.Typical 'spam' issue where people will start by picking okay (normal) characters, then as they get 'frustrated' (by you beating them) they inevitably pick the 'op' guy, and out comes the repetitive tactics out of desperation (and the increasing frustration level ensues..).  This is typical of NetherRealms past game injustice where some characters are 'okay', and you'll play people who lose with 'okay' characters then they get mad and start picking the 'op' guys, and of course start cheap-shotting you and winning.This is very typical of NetherRealm games and relates to them being an Illuminati company and knowing how to create frustrating ego-driven scenarios that lead to anger and 'Wrath'.   (which has a corrupting 'demonic' effect on society..)Graphics are amazing, on a 15 foot (that's right, feet, 8 feet high+14 foot wide) diagonal (projector) 'screen' there are no pixels or anything just deep rich visuals from beads of sweat to scratches on metal, it's a feast for the senses.Sound is top-notch too very few games have such deep rich 'thuds' and 'cracks' as you pummel your opponents, sound is movie quality is this game and a real treat.The variety of characters and stages allow you to play both at night in a 'dark' mood, but also there are lively characters and sunny stages for day-time play.  This is a bonus as it's a great game to have in the background throughout the day while working on other stuff, that's a huge plus for it.Drawbacks include that extremely frustrating gameplay aspect where people pick the 'comeback op' character who has all over-the-top movesets, making it incredibly annoying to win consistenty then all the sudden start losing as players get desperate and pick cheap characters.I'm on the line with the technical aspects of the gameplay as sometimes it can feel solid and rewarding, other times it feels totally way off base especially compared to almost any other fighting game.  I feel much of it has to do with the button-block dynamic that tends to 'drag' after blocking somehow leaving you open to more shots, which is incredibly annoying, frustrating and rather anger-inducing (lol).Note I have a near-flawless blocking ratio in games like sf2 yet here it can seem incredibly difficult to simply block then hit someone back at times -- VERY, very frustrating.Overall I -Would- recommend this game because at least it tries to be somewhat realistic (in the graphics etc), varied game modes and overall effort they put into trying to make a wholistic game experience.Be aware that this is an 'addictive personality/frustration' type game, where the good satisfying feelings almost always come packed with the frustrating angry moments later - it's an adrenaline rush game and not good for relaxing or trying to stay positive (lol).Overall it is what it is and in a world full of fruit-cakey anime fighters it's dark realistic tone alone makes it stand out from the crowd,definitely worth a buy and if you have reason to hesitate get it on sale."

,Recommended,307780,25332728,"Posted: 3 September, 2016",all,Kailen,"With the WB's reversal, and their new decision to release KP2, MKXL, and further support for the PC version, I am restoring my original review of the game from December of 2015.  It may be edited later, when I obtain KP2, to detail further information within:Yes I recommend this game, for the very simple reason that I enjoy it.Now, you have to bear in mind that I give little care for online multiplayer in fighting games. In my experience, it has always been a lag filled waste of time. So I am basing my opinion largely (not entirely though) on the campaign mode.I thought it was fun. After the previous game retread the ground from the first three games, bringing the series back to its roots (which was sorely needed), this game was allowed to take things in a whole new direction. There's several new characters, a good thing to add to the series, which lets a new generation continue the fight twenty five years after the previous game. And, of course, it sets up for a sequel.There are things to dislike. Not the least of which is the excessive amount of DLC. Even if you buy the premium version, which includes the Kombat Pack (which I did), you will be missing Goro, and several costumes.  [Edit: It appears that these missing packs will be part of Kombat Pack 2.  I'll amend this when that pack is out.] Now, we are no longer paying full premium price anymore, but even when the game recently went on sale (it is currently the holiday sale as I write this), the DLC did not. On top of that, there are plans to release another Kombat Pack, with more characters. While I don't have anything particularly against continuing to add content to games, I do think the pricing is a bit steep. $30 for just a handful of characters and some outfits is a tad much. Likewise, $5 for a character alone seems steep. There's also the option to simply buy all the Krypt unlocks, so that you have the whole game ready to go right away. There's nothing inherently wrong with letting people who just don't have the time or inclination go ahead and unlock it all, but I feel that the price point of $20 is far, far too high for such a feature. This is where the $5 price point should be, if it should be a price point at all (this is PC we're talking about here, mods or cheat codes should be able to do the unlocking for you).On top of that, I was saddened to see a few characters, such as Sindel and Baraka (the latter a personal favorite of mine from MK2) are available to fight against, but not as. It's understandable, given that the characters have various styles, but I still would have liked to see them playable. A roster of 24 (initially) is actually fairly impressive overall though, and more characters have since been added. And the characters that are there have some good variety. A few fatalities, some brutalities, lots of special moves and some variations. Looks to be at least a few costumes as well.As for the smoothness of the characters, I have found a few that did not seem as responsive as I'd hoped. A lot of characters seem to have a huge wind-up for their specials, that usually opens them to quick counters, particularly from the AI. This can make them difficult to play as. But if you play around enough, you'll be able to find a character and variant of your liking.The graphics are a big step up from the previous game. Both in game and in the cinematics. The fight choreography in the cinematics has been substantially improved as well. This game looks amazing, if your machine can run it.All in all, the game is not without flaws. But I would say, yea, it's worth picking up. If you're a fan of Mortal Kombat. And if you can get it on sale. Though I would also suggest that if you really want to get the most for your money, hold off a bit and see if they release a true ""complete"" version."

It's an excellent game and runs really well on the PC. One thing that kind of sucks for some people is how short the story is (takes about 6-8 hours without skipping any scenes depending on how often you need to continue) but most of Mortal Kombat X's replay value is in the competative and casual online games with friends and random players. Combos feel great to pull off as they are not quite as easy to string together as other fighters I play (in my opinion), and the large roster with 3 variations of moves per fighter is a perfect way to keep games fresh. Another minor flaw for some people is that a lot of costumes are in the Krypt which you either have to grind for gold to unlock everything, or buy the DLC to unlock everything (I don't recommend it unless it's on sale)Overall it's great game, a bit graphically demanding, tons of replay value, definitely worth the purchase."

I figured I would bump my stereo system and bass, so that I could really feel the sounds of the fighting like I remembered from the original Arcade versions as opposed to the softer sounding Super Nintendo/Sega Genesis versions. I was wrong.  Offline gameplay consists of this:  Fighting through a few towers, win, repeat.  There are these challenges that seem to change often, but they are boring too, and are the same thing: fight through the towers, oh with maybe a handicap or a special power.  Then there's story mode.  Which is absolutely a joke.  Not a fan of how they did story mode.  I know it's a fighting game, but the story mode just straight up sucks and I got bored with it after 20 mins.  Just Overall I would give it 3/10.  I shouldn't have bought it, but I'm just glad I got it on sale at $38.24.  It's definitely one of those games that might be better played on the console with a friend sitting next to you, or rolling the dice and playing online and taking everything that supposedly comes with that."

,Not Recommended,307780,15672764,"Posted: 3 May, 2015",all,DH,"6/10 - Definitely worse than MK9. Despite nice graphics and more brutal X-Rays and fatalities (and brutalities <3) this seems like a step backward from the point that Mortal Kombat (MK9) defined.Yes, there is more interaction with stage itself (as in Injustice) but there are no stage fatalities.There is less warriors (yes, there are various styles but some of them are too weak and some are OP. Additionally there are too many members of Cage/Brigs family). On the plus side however some new/returning heroes are great (D'Vorah, Ferra/Torr. Erron Black or Takeda). Sad thing is that there are some warriors like Barraka, Shindel or Rain that are in the game but are not available in other modes (they are probably comming as DLC).Storymode seems like a joke in comparison to its predecessor. Its shorter (only 4h long) and really boring. There is nothing that makes you want to know whats going to happen next. Quan-Chi and Shinok seem very week (in comparison to Shao Khan from MK9). New ""youngsters"" seem boring andCassie Cage kicking Shinoks♥♥♥♥♥like he is yet another weak characterfeels just sad).  Id say that only scorpion and sub-zero part was interesting. I was also wondering why can't we get story which would focus on ""bad"" characters and let us play as Ermac, Reptile in story-mode?Another sad part is PC port... and this is what I hate about modern gaming. Developers are releasing unfinished games. We have 3rd of may today. Game is out for over two weeks and it still has some serious issues (fps drops on good rigs - for me its visible on Sky Temple, bad Netcode and memory leaks). I hope that this will be fixed soon.Do I recommend this game? I have mixed feelings. If devs will fix these serious issues then it will be a very solid title, however there are still things that are worse than they were in MK9. I'd say - play MK9 for now (if you have it - if you dont then get it!), wait till MKX is fixed and released with more warriors (possibly longer story) in GOTY edition.P.S - I'd love if devs would make more X-Rays that correspond to characters playstyle. Currently each playstyle has the same animation."

,Recommended,307780,26891336,"Posted: 23 November, 2016",all,inK,"TL;DRThe game is really cool as an arcade, for casual playing, you just need some time to master a character. Gameplay is nice, graphics are nice, you should play this with a controller, and multiplayer lacks players. The game is just not for everyone, it's one of those that may get tiring and repetitive for some people, so get it if you are the fighting-game type.====================//==================//=================I have a little of affection for this franchise since before these PC gaming times of mine. It is an arcade game, better played with a controller. The story of the game is not the best, but it is enough for being called decent, although the clichéd holywood ending the last cutscene was great. The main aspect of the game is of course, its gameplay. Works in 2D, Armageddon times are over, each characters has its perks and flaws. Even if not all characters are here, they are being added on Kombat Packs, of course some of them will probably never return though, like Hotaru, Moloch, Kobra, Taven... I wonder if people even know them. Most fatalities are interesting to watch, some of them, of course, look a little odd, like a perfect cut or whatever. Of course the game is not heaven itself, it has its flaws, and, probably, the biggest of them all reside on multiplayer mode, it's almost impossible to play a match, I, myself, never played one.Note: I only did this review for a badge. So not much effort was put into it. So you should read better reviews, there must be lots here."

Half of the reviews said it was good, half said it was bad. Some people said that FPS dropped a lot, the game crashed, it was really laggy and things like that. A lot of people said to go buy it on PS4 or Xbox One, but my problem was I had neither of those consoles and I preger playing games on PC. I bought Injustice on both my PS3 and PC and I enjoyed it a lot more on PC. So I took the chance and bought the game. And it was perfect! Of course Mutliplayer was bad but I'm a more of a single player guy. My computer doesn't meet ALL requirements OR minimum specs for the game, but it runs well! I don't know what the major issue it is with the game being really bad for some people it, I don't know if its just a chance it could be bad, or it requires a specific thing in your computer. But I do recommend this game! If you want to take the chance and buy it on PC. If you don't mind it on console, and you have either the PS4 or Xbox One, maybe get it on that just in case or if you want to play more Multiplayer than Singleplayer.

I'm more interested in learning the mechanics in regards to PC because the online experience is sub par. The PC port of this game crashes occasionally after ending an online match. Also, this version usually receives patches many weeks, almost months after its console counterparts. Lobbies never show accurate ping and connection speeds. I'd recommend purchasing one of the console versions as High Voltage studios (developer studio responsible for the port) does not push fixes on a consistent basis unlike Netherrealm Studios."

I haven't played it on consoles for comparison, but there was a time or two where the framerates would drop from 45-50 to like 30 on my machine and the game would seem to run in slow motion for just a few seconds instead of just dropping frames to keep the game speed where it was supposed to be.  There's a few subjects on the Steam forums and Reddit that mention various bugs and glitches with the PC version of the game which was apparently ported from the console version by a third party, and the port is apparently inferior to the console version.Minor bugs aside, the game is fun to play and if you're into the MK back-story, you'll enjoy this one.  Being the first MK game I've played since Deception on the Gamecube, I was thoroughly impressed with the improved visuals and fully voice acted story telling.  It fully supports the use of a controller which is a far superior option for this type of game in my opinion.  If you're a PC gamer and you enjoy Mortal Kombat, this could make a nice addition to your Steam library."

No? Well, flip you, because there are quick time events peppered throughout the story. I've never failed one so I don't know if you have to redo the whole thing if you fail but rest assured if you do fail the fight after you have to watch the same cutscene and then do the same QTE again.OFFLINE 2 PLAYER-Yes, it is only offline 2 player; if you have more friends... well now you don't.-Epic combos seem to of been removed entirely and instead you get this interesting ability to choose your fighting style with the character you pick, giving them a slightly different outfit and a unique set of abilities. Is it good? I dunno, ask the hardcore fans... it just means that I don't get wrecked online instantly anymore, take that as you will.-You can interact with the background of the map just like Injustice (If you've played it) to finish some cool little combos.I may of missed some things in this Singleplayer/2 Player review but these are at least the most important to me.Overall I will give this game an 8/10, the story is short and sweet, the characters are all entertaining, there is some love drama peppered throughout, there is no 4 player anymore (really salty about that) the ending is deus ex machina as f, they stripped all the characters of most of their abilities and added a new system of speciality kits instead, also if you stick around for after the credits you unlock the big bad man himself and get to see (SPOILER) Kitana and Liu Kang rule the netherrealm together.

I had a refund ready just in case but I was pleasantly surprised with how much of a boredom killer this is. The graphics are top notch and stuff sure, but coming from playing many hours of injustice and being more used to that game's combat I feel right at home. MK9's inputs were way too specific for my liking and I understand that might be a case of ""git gud"" but I appreciate a Mortal Kombat game that is more accessible to non-experts. The DLC characters are a nice touch too. The horror movie characters are fun to play as and feel like they fit right in.NOTE: For those who are bothered by this sort of thing, this is a forewarning that the framerate is capped at 30 in certain instances. During the fight, you will get 60 fps and above, however in the main menu, character select screen, during introductions, during x-ray moves, and during fatalities, the framerate will drop to 30.

If you like fighting games, buy it. If you're not sure, get Mortal Kombat Komplete Edition on sale for like $5 and see if it's your thing. The graphics are very attractive and the 60 FPS combat is visceral and clear. The animations are smooth and are a very big improvement over MK9's artificial 'gamey' animation style. The fighting looks natural and organic.The character roster features a host of old and new characters, so you can pick your favorite main right back up, or find someone new. A lot of the new characters are quite cool, such as my personal favorite, Erron Black. If you don't like the way your character looks, you can use a costume! My personal favorites are Hanzo Scorpion, Grandmaster Sub Zero, and Ronin Kenshi.The variations are fantastic and completely live up to the hype. You can sway matchups based on how you pick your variations, while still retaining the characters main theme. For example Scorpion, who is all about combos, is changed drastically by his variations. Inferno Scorpion can zone enemies, then, through proper footsies, forces his enemies into a sick combo chain using his demons to extend combos without letting them drop. Ninjitsu Scorpion has extended range melee attacks that are lightning fast, perfect for hyper combo chaining. Variations allow for replayability and competetive strategic diversity.I only have a few gripes. I would of really liked to see more than 1 X-Ray per character. 1 X-Ray per variation would of been nice. The grab animations can be a bit repetetive as well if you're using it a bit. Graphical options are a tad limited. It's not terrible, but there could of been more. The best anti-aliasing option is FXAA, while it's not extremely taxing, it doesn't look great. Also, all cinematics such as fatalities, intros, and X-Rays are in 30 FPS. I don't know who made that decision. It's not a big deal, but it's noticable. Oh, and we'll just sweep that PC launch fiasco under the rug and pretend it never happened.Overall, this game is awesome and if you even remotely think you'll enjoy it or have a background in fighting games, BUY IT! If you're still not convinced, go buy Mortal Kombat Komplete Edition on sale for $5 and try out the Mortal Kombat series. Great roster, fluid gameplay, satisfying to play, and an epic game. A solid 9/10 earning my golden mark of value. I don't usually reccomend games at full price, but this title is worth $60. If you really enjoy it, I would reccomend getting Goro and the Kombat Pack as well. This game is badass and it will remain that way.FINISH HIM!BELOW CONTAINS THE OUTDATED ON-RELEASE REVIEW:Game crashes on selection of single player and two player. Some features that should be queued for download are not downloading. Unstable launch that doesn't allow me to play tha game. Will not change my negative rating until this is fixed.Edit: All features that should be downloading are not downloading at all.Edit 2: Upon selection of ANY option, the game crashes.

I've seen many reviews that say things like ""The online doesnt work"" or ""Don't get this game, the online isn't playable"" I have played online matches a few times, and there is a bar that tells you your connection, if the bar is low, dont join it. I haven't had many matches that had a very low connection and the ones that had a sorta low connection still had very little lag issues. What i'm saying here is that I bet most of the people who say the online isn't playable, either go into those matches with the crappy connection, or they have a lacking PC or Internet connection. ALTHOUGH. After all the good things I said about MKX, I still don't think it is worth the full $60, I think it's worth $35-$45, so if the game goes on for that amount, and you're not sure whether or not to get it, give it a try."

I don't know exactly how bad this game was on PC, but it now runs very well, even on my crappy laptop (Of course, I had to lower the graphics settings, but even then, it still looks quite nice). The only problem I have during fights is that it will sometimes be in slow motion, but that's easily fixed by either pausing and unpausing, doing an x-ray attack, or simply waiting. I'm sure the slow motion bug happens only because my laptop isn't that good, so hopefully, this doesn't happen to those of you with good PCs.The story mode performed well, too. But after playing the story mode for a while without stopping, some of the audio started to make buzzing sounds. I fixed this by leaving the story mode and going back into it. Again, this may be because of how not-good my laptop is.Overall, would recommend this game to PC players."

For the game to continue to be buggy, one of the bugs that i've been getting is after i close the game, the game keeps on running on my pc, making me have to close the process. Another is the online mode to simply be not working, everytime i get on an online match, 15 secs after my match started the game says that the match does not exist anymore. Not only that, but making us pay for goro is simply bs in a game that already costs $59,99, they also decreased immensely the amount of gold you get playing the game just so you buy the ""unlock all krypt"". It does not contain babalities nor stage fatalities (MK9 had them), and the story mode is a joke if compared to the MK9 story mode. An awesome addition to the game is putting different fighting styles to the same character, making a single character have more possibilities and different play styles, but the character rooster in this game is way smaller than the MK9 character rooster. It seems that for every step forward they made with this game, there were two steps back. So I do not recommend this game, at least not for this price"

I even had a party for this game and setup a tournament at my house! The graphics are amazing, and be changed on the fly. The online features many different modes and ways to connect to others via chat rooms, matchmaking, and steam invite. The krypt is large and has many different surprises! The story isnt bad but its cool to see the characters interact. The variations are really cool and the characters/multiple costumes are of a large variety. This game is the most brutal-est and bloodiest game i have ever seen. Seeing classic kombat characters age and still whooping some butt is awesome. Kombat is fluid, technical, and fast paced.The bad: Currently it just doesnt work. Thats the only issue I have and why i cannot say that I recommend this game. Its amazing, if it worked. when playing singleplayer the game will randomly exit you back to the desktop or freeze the computer to the point where you have to hard shutdown. Online has worked about 50% of the time i have attempted, and factions work 20% of the time i have checked. When entering online sometimes your in rapidly, other times you have to exit out and go back in just to connect online. When searching for a room or checking leaderboards it works half of the time. When in a online game it will exit you to the desktop, or freeze and require the hard shutdown as mentioned before, but there are additions that make this a trainwrekt to play online. not only do you have to deal with these two problems, but theres problems with no being able to connect to other players. Sometimes when in a room with multiple players it kicks everyone out. Desynchronization errors happen randomly and exit you back to the mkx main menu too. Online is not reliable as now you have to trust two people to stay connected to a game instead of 1. Sometimes it takes me 3 program restarts to get online and connect to an opponent just to get desynchronized. All of the problems can be fixed in my opinion with patches/game updates/etc. I have spent more time attempting to get a match start than playing the game and that is not a lie. I will obviously change my review once it is fixed. But it isnt. Don't buy this game until it is fixed.

So on top of the microtransactions, bad PC support, awful netcode and overall failure on WB's part to give PC users a worthwhile game for more than a year after they paid for it, (some of us having paid $100+ for the complete version at launch and then were subsequently abandoned, ouch) now they're absolute liars as well.I will keep my money, and probably avoid all WB titles in the future given their recent track record.Before anyone says anything, since I know you dirty Steam animals you: I know, my playtime.

Finally I won't sit and think ""What should I play now?"". Now let's talk about positive and negative sides of this game.Positive:-Story mode. Mortal Kombat had story modes for quite a long time (Since MKU, I believe). And it's really awesome. Yeah, sometimes reasons to fight are stupid, but who cares? It's Mortal Kombat and the story itself is epic!-Kharacters and variations. Every character is balanced. If you can't beat someone, you can just change your variation. Also variations are new and interesting addition to this game. You can master all 3 of them for every situation, or you can choose one (if you're lazy) and fight.-Gameplay. Probably the best Mortal Kombat right now. Played many MK games(skipped PS2 era and MK vs DC, but played Unchained and enjoyed it). But still have to get used to some classic abbilities, that they have different combinations now. Example - Scorpion's (my favourite character) spear. Instead of back back  X (if you're using XBox controller), it's back forward X now.That's all :DAnd about microtransactions. No one forces you to buy DLCs. They'll not affect gameplay itself. I'm not agains microtransactions that will not affect game. Look at CS:GO and Dota 2 (also my favourite games). No one is crying about microtransactions is them.I'll rate this game 10/10. Optimisation is fine after the update (but still some lags during X-Rays)."

There is a lot of hate on steam about this game, but I just want to say.I HAVE HAD ZERO PROBLEMS WITH THIS GAME.It installed perfectly, it plays perfectly, the frame rate is good, It has not crashed once and Online Play is aceptable, not great but better than Injustice or MK9.All in all, do not belive that hate, this game is beyond good and any fan should buy it right now and support PC ports.Here is a post I made on the forum...I see all the hate on this forum but I just wanted to drop a line saying my MKX experience has been frickn awesome.It installed fine, really fast due to the streaming thing. By the time I was able to string a few combos together most of the content apart from the story had come down. That was really neat. No waiting for a massive download to start and kinda giving me time to get used to it before trying online.The game ran fine on my system, which is pretty old, but has a new card. I've had 1 or two little slow downs in game, but nothing that wasn't forgotten in about a second, as a tiny slow down once or twice in a few hours is not an issue.So lets talk Online.... this was a little disappointing. The lag was really bad, and I was in a special room for my country. What I discovered though that it seamed to be the download stream. After the entire game had downloaded and there was no background downloading the online game works pretty well. Easily enough to link combos and block. I mean it is not as good as local, but still pretty good. Best netherrealm has done so far.All in all I am extremely pleased with this game. Gameplay is great, there is TONS of single player content to get though to hone your skills and online is not even 1/3rd as bad as some people make out.Very happy!"

The only con I found was story mode is a little too long and gets boring. It would be nice if they could do a tekken style of the characters and each have they own stories and explain there background and how they became apart of mortal kobat. Yes, you can always wiki that but wheres the fun of understanding all the rivals."
,Recommended,307780,28963665,Posted: 2 January,all,PayShayCarl,"Mortal Kombat, a series known to America for over 20 years, debuting all the way back in 1992 as one of the first games to challenge and require a system to judge it's gore-infused fighting while games such as Street Fighter 2 took the reigns of home fighting with tight controls and a SFW, albeit, a bit sexual at times, home console release. We all know and love the original MK's for being advancements on the fighting games of the past, but does this new title hold its weight under the collossal success of it's predecessors?To put it short, MKX is not only a beauty to take place in the line up of Mortal Kombat history, but it improves on previous mechanics, adding 3 play styles to traditional characters and adapting their look to fit more inline with the previous games than the infamous MK9's sexual and edgy style.Do I recommend this game? Of course, this game garnours not only the price of admission after sales but at retail it's a game worth a purchase, and with as few balancing tweaks needed, this game could possibly be one of the best tournament fighters of the last 5 years.Buy it now."

,Recommended,307780,15392289,"Posted: 15 April, 2015",all,SнagzyDODOOL,"This game really feels like the culmination of all the other games come together. The game handles the same as ever, controls haven't changed much at all over the years which means it is very easy to pick up and play. Of course there is more depth to it than mere button bashing and the range of combos that can be carried out is better than ever. Each character now has 3 variants which are significantly different to each other and will encourage a huge amount of replay value learning all their intricacies.Of course the fatalities, brutalities are back and as gruesome as ever plus the X-Ray moves from MK9 return but beefed up and feel far more rewarding. There is a huge roster of characters with 8 entirely new characters, plus most of the favourites in there all looking better than ever it must said, the graphics really are excellent.New to this game is the introduction of factions when starting the game for the first time you will be prompted to join one of these factions, every person in this faction whether playing multi-player or not contributes xp to that faction and levels up. When finished maxing out in that faction you can then switch to one of the others and start again; admittedly this isn't all that exciting as levelling up is nothing more than playing the game but it does add extra replay value to the completionists out there who will want to max out every faction.As far as single player goes the story is fairly short and I have knocked it out in just under 4 hours, far more substantial is the Tower which contains a number of challenges (not sure how many yet) that get progressively harder, completing these unlocks additional content and Koins which can be used to purchase various items in the in game shop similar to MK9.Multiplayer is the usual fare of 1v1 local or online and King of the Hill winner stays on battles and will doubtless be where the majority of time is spent having battles with friends and is great fun as ever.Overall this is a superb Mortal Kombat game, may yet prove to be the best to date but will need more time with it before taking that decision.10/10"

They are so bad that at one point me and my opponent refused to change characters because going to the character select screen risked crashing the game!Performed Cassie Cages Sefie fatality? Crashes the game. But even if it doesn't, the screen never recovers its resolution because the fatality changes it as part of its 'joke'. Well thats a good joke, realy breaks the forth wall there buddy.I wasn't hyped for this game. I am not a fan of Mortal Kombat. But this game looked so good that I bought it. That is a true testament to how great the graphics sound and music are. They really are amazing although the storyline is a let down. MK(9) had an amazing story mode but here its just time skip after time skip and theassumptionthat you read the comics so you know what is going on. Well I didn't, so I don't. How did Jax, who was dead and still IS dead, manage to have a daughter? I will never find out unless I buy the comics. So story mode is already a let down after the quite frankly 'amazing' MK(9).Gameplay wise, the cast is large and the 3 modes per characters is somewhat great as well but the differences between some variations is so minor that it stands out when other characters play completely differently. I imagine that came from time constraints really.Overall MKX has a lot going for it...When it works.I can't recommend it right now though, online is broken beyond belief, offline crashes frequently, bugs are aplenty and worst of all is that the console versions are in just as much dire straits so their is no guarantee of an 'early fix'. When you have so many fires to put out, you are going to prioritize the one that is costing you the most money and I imagine in this case that will be the console versions.MKX, I love you but this on-off relationship is damaging us both.

I can confirm it is not just new graphics cards that suffer, but also slightly older ones. I have a nvidia gtx 555, so I wasn't expecting to run this at max or maybe even at high settings since it is next gen; but even on lowest setting my framerate is unbearable.

,Recommended,307780,15424658,"Posted: 17 April, 2015",all,.SithLord.,"Oh well! Where do i start with?1) Game: MKX es the best MK from the series by far, sorry MKII. Great cast of characters, with unique variations, that makes the fights different every time. I really love the new Towers, the Faction Wars and the new Krypt, crippier than ever, that makes the game last longer. The Story mode is quite entertained, more like a movie than a game mode itself, but well rounded story. And last (and the best of all)... the finishers (Fatalities, Brutalities and Faction Wars), more blood and gruesome than ever, fantastic job there.2) Game Engine: This is a port from the PS4 version made by High Voltage, same guys that did MK9 for PC. This make the expectations very high, considering that they did a terrific job for the last game. BUT... this time around, the game lacks of performance. Ed Boon and NetherRealm confirmed that the game will run 1080p@60fps, but actually it runs at 30fps fixed. Also involves the really bad optimization for the graphics settings, that in some background gets pretty lame fps and very pixeled (Dead Woods). In addition the no inclusion of the animations in the fighter select, really disappointing.I hope that the actual update can fix all this issues.3) Steam Streaming Installation: Here is where i have mixed feelings. At first, an excellent idea, similar toBattle.netapp with Blizzard games (WoW, SC2, D3, HotS, etc), but very poor execution. What it makes me angry was the idea to select every package that needs to be download for the game to start, horrible system. That was suppose to be done automatically but no, must be done manual. So... you must make more clicks instead of just 1 to download the full game, this needs to be fixed. It's OK for the DLC content but for the hole game? Bad idea.Conclusion:You must be very patient, but the wait is worth it to play this excellent game. Recommended."

I must say it's a damn good addition to the franchise!First off, I'm going to start by saying that I've been playing Mortal Kombat since it's early days on the Super Nintendo and Genesis. Those games never failed to keep me interested, I found them more interesting than the homework I was supposed to be doing, lol. Anyways, onto my review.What really drew me into this game was the ability to play it locally on PC with my wife and MKX's sheer crazy brutality the installment has (not speaking of the special move) The overall presentation is nice and it feels great. Yes, it is a bit slower than any previous games but it's a good slow. Granted I do prefer the faster combat of the previous game but the fighting in this game actually works to a degree, it actually feels strong and impactful.Visually, the game is pretty compelling if you have the machine for it (and thank goodness I do!) I mean it's detailed enough to where you actually see beads of sweat on the characters, all the way down to the smaller details in the clothing. Still on visuals, there are times where there's a framerate drop while you're in the middle of fight and it could mean life or death for your character.As far as sound goes...hmm, well there were times where I had to restart the game to fix some crackling and lipsync to sound mismatching in story mode but if you can hear through all of that, good on you.The storyline is damn fun for sure, it's like you're immersed into a interactive movie to a large degree. I won't spoil anything for you but it was a good storyline. It takes the events of '98's MK4 on the PC, N64, and PS1 and sugar coats it with some twists and turns but the story is still the same at it's core.I really wish I could say more but if you're looking for a game to play at parties, a fan of the originals, the need to beat stuff up after a long day at work, gore, and the pleasent sound of bones breaking this game will quench that thirst for sure.Pros:- Great Graphics, feels real, and looks amazing.- Gameplay is slow, but it delivers a more impactful feel as opposed to previous installments.- Love the amount of characters to choose from.- The Storyline is probably the best one I've seen ever in this franchise.Cons:- Frequent framerate problems.- Sounds are very crackly at times as well as lipsync mismatches (specifically in Story Mode)- Questionable business practices.All in all I think it's a fine addition save for the few problems I've mentioned above.8.5/10"

I think everyone like this game too when they favourite character do some Fatality Moves or Brutality Moves and so do i... You can play this game in online mode too if you want it... Okay, That's enough for my positive reviews and now the negative reviews for this game... First, You should spend your money to buy some DLC's to complete the characters in this game... Second, Buy some DLC's not enough if you really want to complete the characters skins because you should connect your Mortal Kombat XL PC Version with Mortal Kombat X Mobile Version and do some mission between the Mobile Version and PC Version... Third, Did you think that's enough for complete all characters skin??? LOL, Nope Brother... You should playing in online mode and do some mission to unlock the all revenant skins... Of course, you should open some treasure in Crypt mode... Fourth, This is the most legendary in this game... You can't get the Gold Scorpion forever because no one know that how to unlock The Gold Scorpion Skin in this Mortal Kombat XL PC Version... Fifth, Mortal Kombat X Mobile Version is more updated than Mortal Kombat XL PC... Why??? It's so funny brother when i see Freddy Character in Mortal Kombat X Mobile Version and still unavailable in Mortal Kombat XL PC Version... Sixth, Make sure you always have some money because this game will suck your money slowly... Why??? That's because this game will added some DLC's slowly and the price is little expensive... I think that's all my reviews for this game... You can see more negative reviews than the positive reviews... It's all up to you... If you doesn't matter about the negative reviews so you should buy it...

This game is not going to get any new content and it was pretty much Dead on arrival. It took months to fix the first set of issues and in that time the online community died.
,Recommended,307780,30664828,Posted: 22 March,all,Villainess,"The most violent fun I've had in ages, and now one of my favorite games. There's lots of content old fans of the series will love, and new fans might be surprised by how interesting the story can be. Mortal Kombat brings more to the table than Street Fighter or any other 1v1 fighting game, IMO.The good: The gore is more realistic and satisfying than ever, though I miss the visible damage fighters suffered in MK9. Combat is fun and the weak links in the roster are few. The sexualization of the female characters in MK9 didn't bother me, but I can't complain that NRS wants to take their franchise in a more mature direction with the more realistic redesigns in MKX. The characters themselves also seem to have grown up.Old characters are missed but the new ones have grown on me, and even the horror movie DLC characters don't feel like as much of a slap in the face as they did on launch. The Tarkatan Xenomorph is pretty cool. That being said, if NRS decides to release more DLC, which is unlikely, I hope they'll remember the original characters we miss.The bad: Online gameplay is frustrating at times (but not as bad as it was on launch), especially for international players. I'm in Australia; the online servers for PC are a ghost town. Fortunately, I don't play with others much, so that doesn't bother me. Mastering more than one character is hard, but the ability to post combos on the screen is greatly appreciated and is something MK9 really lacked, IMO.Despite playing for 200+ hours I've never been able to advance beyond what I call ""educated button mashing"", but maybe that's just how these games are. I've played with both a keyboard and Xbox controller on PC and prefer the keyboard, as I've discovered special moves are easier to pull off that way. I look forward to seeing if gameplay improves on the Xbox or PS4, but I've played worse ports.I admit my interest in the game dropped sharply after I finished the story (which seemed shorter than MK9's) and I unlocked everything in the Krypt, but somehow I keep coming back to it. 200+ hours of gameplay can't be wrong. As far as I'm concerned, this is the best MK game yet."

With th launch issues aside this game is not optimised and I regularly go from 60fps to 10fps .   The only way to fix it is to exit out of the game and restart only a temp fix or do an xray move that forces the game to go to 30 fps then back to 60 fps.  Again only a temp fix.   Unless Steam changes there policy about refunds I won't be buying any more games from these developers in the future.   Guess if I want to play another MK game I will have to go to console as it runs fine on that system.

I, to my dismay, got the short straw and got one of the worst ports I've seen. Which is a shame, cause under all these colossal f*** ups is an amazing game. But if you have horrible luck, you'll get an almost unplayable game that is a disgrace to modern AAA games.Pros:-Amazing graphics.-A more thought out combat system.-All the over-the-top gore and campiness we enjoy from this franchise.-A very nice story.-Plenty of different parts of the game to keep you busy. (Faction related gameplay, hourly/weekly changing towers, Krypt, etc.)-Story cutscenes play at a beautiful 60+ fps.Cons: This is solely what I have experienced and are what is keeping me from fully recommending the **** out of this game.-Missing blocky textures that only appear during gameplay, they don't appear during cutscenes.(Multiple colors; in certain situations it looks like a disco party)(the size of the blocks are about the size of a kharacter's pupil, so imagine 1000s of those scattered across the arena and all over a fighter's body)-HUGE framerate drops during the actual fighting.-Frequent crashes.-Lin Kuei Temple and Sky Temple are laggy wonderlands of joy.-Even bigger framerate drops when you do a fatality or x-ray. (roughly 15-20fps with desynched audio and everything. It's lovely)-Worst launch day I've ever experienced.Now for the actual cons of the game itself:-Story, as nice as it is, is a little too short and could've been expanded more.-Not all fighter's are as visually appealing as others. (most notably Sonya, who looks a little bland)-Microtransactions to simplify something that isn't even that difficult.-No combat damage that MK9 had.In it's current state, I give it a 4/10. These issues are unacceptable in a AAA game.Without them, the game would easily get an 8 or 9/10 and a recommendation.

The online play is really solid when both players have a strong connection. I've played well over 300 matches online and the netcode is actually very good, the problem is the connection indicators aren't working properly do it's impossible to know who's going to lag but once they get that fixed the game will be near perfect.

Yes this PC version of this game does have bugs and and performance is lackluster but when it does run the game is awesome.The gameplay is superior in every aspect  compared to MK9 except the fact it lacks tag battle but then again very few people played tag so the dev decided to focus their ressources on features that would benefit the whole community. Nethereal is getting trashed for producing a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port but maybe you need to consider its Epic's fault and their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ optimised unreal engine 4. When MK9 came out unreal engine 3 was way older and optimised. No wonder we don't have a PS3 or XBOX 360 version yet. MK devs can't optimize draw call and tweak the engine even if they wanted.MKX has many game modes online and offline that will keep you busy for a long time. Story was a bit shorter and not as good as MK9 but with each character having  3 variations you and up with a grand total of 72 variations!!!  Add to that gameplay modifiers like luck in test your luck in MK9, you get living towers that implement and you get a unique gameplay experience everytime.Online netcode has been improved since MK9 and an bunch of new online modes make their debut. The list goes on and on.The game did have a messy release but i did get it running on day one before even patch got released. Seriously either people have gotten more stupid or more impatient in this age of instant gratification. It was not obvious but not witchcraft either. You had to dowload the packages individualy. I run this game smothly with a pretty old system here are my specs:Asus Rampage Formula X48Watercooled Intel core  2 Quad Q9650 3 Ghz @ 3.84 Ghz8 GB DDR2 @ 1066 Mhz Cas 5-5-5-15Nvidia GTX680Intel SSD 530 series  240 GBWindows 7 x64 SP1The game with everything maxed out runs between 30-60 fpsTo play in 3D vision you need to deactivate shadows since you get bad artifacts. In 3D vision  with everything else full settings it runs 25-50 fps.I am a programmer and really tech savy but I don't have agressively optimised my system for gaming since i use it for work too and have various process running in the background. I have overclocked my cpu quite a lot putting in the league of core i5 cpus but mu gpu is still bottlenecked.If you like fighting games and MK franchise you are going to enjoy this. Sure you'll be frustrated when the game crashes or freezes but it an rare exception than the rule and i am confident this issues will be ironed out."

The game works for me; I do think that that netherealm should continue to tweak the game so it is playble for a wide variety of pc's (in terms of how powerful they are). Now the game itself is a masterpiece fighting game. The controls are fast and responsive, the combo posibilities are endless and the classic ending kills are more brutal and detailed than ever. The gameplay is outstanding and is addicting as hell. The idea of the Kombat pack is really stupid and I would reccomend people to buy it on another website that supports steam purchases for a lower price. Other than this, X is an outstanding fighter and may be the best Mortal Kombat to date. I really hope that more patches come out to meet the needs of those who cannot run it properly. 9.2/10."

Now you can combo easily with every character and all characters have more longer attack cooldown than MKKE. Johnny Cage and Cyrax have very short attack cooldowns in MKKE.

Yes, the fact that they released with all of those unfixed patches and bugs is a ♥♥♥♥♥ and a half to deal with, but for now just focus on the core of the game.So that being said, my honest review of MKX is... it's a great game. Bugs aside, it offers a fresh reboot to the series, even if the story mode lacked a bit storywise. The gameplay feels slick and fun, all of the characters are given unique movesets to shake things up, and the new X-ray moves and fatalities are... to say the least, brutal. If you are going to play this on PC, make sure that you have as computer with an updated graphics card, enough space for the game so that you won't settle for the minimum requirements, and other things of that nature, because no one wants a laggy and slow MK experience.One of the new modes they added was the ability to join one of the factions, like Lin Kuei or Black Dragon, and fight in a competitive online modeto win gold and rewards.So all in all, this was a great game. Slick gameplay, brutal X-rays and fatalities, unique characters, and the new online mode. It would have been a better experience for everyone if they released it fully without its bugs and patches, but until then they are slowly building it back up to what fans expected. Just make sure your computer has the power to handle it."

I spent $60 for a game that was never completed and has been on sale a few times sence.  To be honest this was the worse release ever and I feel that I was ripped off.  I will never pre-purchase another game due to this.  Good job WB and Steam.Next I never recieved my DLC for Goro.  After contacting WB about this issue 3 times they finally reply back a month later with off the wall answers or questions, which had nothing to do with my missing DLC.  After a few months go by with a back and forth with this company they told me to send them screen shots of the missing DLC and recipt, then they closed out the ticket.  After trying to start a new ticket they close it once again.  This company is worse then EA, if you can even believe that.Now after the short rant of the company and how they do business... on to the game itself.  I tried to play it and forced myself repeatedly to keep playing, yet the game seemed lacking and sadly i just cant put my finger on it.  Some of the moves should register as a fatality but they just use it as some extra gore during the game e.g. punch someone hard to break the spine.  Dont get me wrong it fits the game well on the graphics and gore, but it just seems misplaced within the fights.I think i should have waited for it to become a Game Of the Year Edition on a Steam sale..."

If you are bored with fighting games that doesn't provide any balance to each of your favourite fighters then look no further this game is for you. Graphics are excellent and the dungeon crypt is better than ever from the previous iterations. I recommend that you get the kombat pack as if you were to opt for the normal one, i don't think you could be able to select a few characters to fight with.My only complaint would be the online combat server. its so laggy due to no regions to divide them up hence you will get a worldwide of netizens trying to connect and fight each other but you will be disconnected etc. before you are even able to finish a match with someone. Haven't logged on in awhile because of that. But if they did a fix or even provide better servers that divide up the players by region, would be an appealing thing to come back to and play. You can just make it into 3 regions like blizzard does. US, Europe, Asia. Then maybe the lag will be less or even nowhere to be seen.In that, I end my review here and also would like to share that the promo music video sold me on to buying this game in its entirety. I still enjoy on how gory and brutal you make the game to. It's ugly but entertaining to watch at the same time. Enjoy the visual 3D gore. Have fun playing."

I've so much on fun on this game as I've have with Injustice Gods Among Us with the story mode, I would say the story mode contents itself is worth half the money I've paid for the game.On the negative side, I've read about other people comments about bad PC port graphics etc but playing on my home laptop I would consider this a plus since I really need to set the video configuration setting to low configuration to play it smoothly.The put it all in the big picture, the following is my current rating of the fighting game of steam I've own.1. USF4 (1v1; movement depends on character i.e. Abel rolling special command; complex command; defense on directional input)2. Mortal Kombat X (1v1; simple command; interactive stage; defense on designated button)3. Injustice: God Among US (1v1; simple command; interactive stage; defense on designated directional input;)4. KOF13 (3v3; more dynamic movement i.e. different types of jump, rolling; complex command; defense on directional input)In short, if you're hardcore fighting gaming guys this game is a definite buy especially when it's on sales; it a simple, beautiful and fun fighting games.By the way; I play all the game above using keyboard with hitbox configuration.10/10."

The addition of brutalities is a nice touch as well.This game is pretty great for a fighter. Despite the terrible launch, the game overall is good. The fighting and characters are fun, gameplay is solid like netherrealms previous games and there is alot to do in this game.The story mode was fun but overall kind of boring to me. I enjoyed going through it but for some reason I think I enjoyed MK9s better. I think it was also due to nostalgia reasons though.The online towers are fun and provide a unique experience to keep you playing and the Faction idea is pretty fun. The online faction war options tend to not be on all the time but I believe they are on a timer and are only available at certain times of the week.The online for me has been good when playing with friends however I have had some weird instances during online after a few rounds sometimes my screen goes black and my computer locks up. In offline mode this game runs silky smooth, when it goes online, its a roulette to tell if the game is going to putter out and make me see blackness.This game is still very new and they are still working the kinks out.  For now my review will be tentative if they fix the online and get the PC version up to its current consoles version.9 decapitated tarkatan heads out of 10"

Based on what others are saying I think it's safe to say general complaints about the technical quality of the title should be discarded at this point.As for the quality of the game as a fighter, it's just a really fantastic offering. I think I've played just about every fighter made and I'm going to say this is likely my favorite 2D fighter of all time. It does reward aggression, but it is by no means a shallow game getting by on flash and gore. It balances fun and depth with great success, and it does it looking better than anything I think has ever been done (with Injustice coming up right behind it.)There were a lot of past MK entries where the characters started to blur together, but this one does a wonderful job of making all of the characters feel unique, and the variations mean that almost any character you want to use has a chance to fit the way you play AND be competitive with high tier characters.I love it. I really, really love it.***updateWith news today that the PC version is not going to receive the Kombat Pack 2 content, this version of the game may have just became a sale only item. MKXL looks like it will be wrapping the game up, not just with some extra characters, but with what is appearing to be massively improved net code for online play. The early beta testing is looking very positive, but we won't be getting that. This means you will need to be happy with playing the game offline, short 4 characters, and with dated balancing (new balancing is showing up in the net code beta.)That's unfortunate news among some really good news. With upcoming KI and SFV showing strong dev support, serious PC gamers may need to look those directions.For everyone else, if the game goes on sale then it's still a really good buy for someone that isn't looking for online play and doesn't care if they are playing with the latest balancing. If you want to take the game seriously then you will need console, but otherwise there is still a lot of game to enjoy."

Storys ok, its not gonna win any awards or anything but it gets the job done and is interesting enough that I wanted to see how it turned out. The characters are fairly varied personality wise and there are some well choreographed fight scenes throughout the story. The pre-fight banter is pretty cool too, although that’s usually reserved for versus matches as the story mode is doing its own thing. If you’re creative you can even create your own drama as you force a girl to shoot her own mother in the jaw and take a selfie of the result or make a guy fight his girlfriend’s father in a battle to the death which ends with the dad puking his own guts out.Visually this game is a looker. Im kind of amazed they put this much effort into the graphics, to be honest, even on my aging rig it still looked very good.Gameplay-wise its more or less like MK9, except for a couple new things they added in like a stamina bar and brutalities. Characters also have 3 “stances” or whatever they’re called and they can make a big difference on how they play. They put a lot of effort into some other stuff though, like the Krypt, which plays out like and old school first person rpg in which you unlock extra content like skins and concept art. They also added the faction system, which is still too early to get a proper feel for but basically lets you chose between 5 groups and throws some challenges your way. Towers are back and now encompass the arcade mode too (classic tower or something to that effect) and offer you some nifty challenges, with living towers changing every so often."

With bad marketing and some rather obnoxious choices/cuts/design decisions, that ultimately make it a smaller game than it's predecessors (going along the same line as the latest Soul Calibur game)The DLC is really on the nose, it's pricey given what it is, and the small amount it adds to the game, and the fact that the Kombat pack DOES NOT include everything, which, despite being intentional is ultimately a poor choice.Blue Steel Sub-zero is poorly textured in comparison to the rest of the game.The Klassic packs are no where near as polished and smooth as they were in MK9Jason and Predator are hugely gimmicky, and hardly inspire to be played, they just break the immersion.Tanya's a cool character, but with her being included in the storyline, (non-playable, but existant) it's really iffy why she wasn't included as a playable character to begin with.The Brazil pack... I don't see why you'd get it even as a joke.Kold War is one of the coolest sets of DLC skins this game has to offer, completely different from the rest, and they feel fresh.The Horror pack is kinda *eh* but the skins all look good and a well crafted.The Samurai pack has some really cool skins, and a really intimidating looking Kenshi skin (the best there is imo)Goro is a good character locked behind an obnoxious paywall.Tremor... well honestly I haven't found much reason to play him at all.You also have several characters in the story mode that aren't included as playable characters, but as you can fight them, obviously have move sets but have been ultimately cut from the roster for goodness knows what reason.You have, Baraka, Sindel, Rain hell even Smoke makes an appearance.And then you have some of the influential characters that have been entirely cut from the roster and the mentions of the game(with the exceptions of some).These characters are: Noob Saibot, Cyrax, Nightwolf, Jade, Stryker(seen), Sektor, Kabal(seen).(Stryker and Kabal are both seen as remnants however, neither are playable)Brutalities are back by the way (fist pump)The game is good, well polished and well executed, but there's so much that turns up my nose, such as microtransactions for easy fatalities, and the obnoxious paywall for a character included already IN THE GAME. (Do not, I repeat do not include content in a game and then lock it from being used.)I'm afraid this franchise might fall into disarray like so many before it because of this silly new fad of making half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥content and then selling it, that DLC and microtransactions have so easily allowed these days.Yes. Ultimately, it's a good game. I give it 8/10IT WOULD be much higher (a ten even) but cutting characters from the roster and shoddy DLC and paywall practices ruin it for it."

Thankfully the only bugs I suffered from are the first 3. Now the first 2 bugs have been fixed and the framerate in Shaolin Temple have improved slightly. Running on a Phenom ][ 965, 16GB of RAM and 5850  at 1680 by 1050 with all the effects reduced to low or disabled, I was pleasantly surprised to find it playable at 60fps.On the gameplay side they have really delivered. A massive improvement over the last game. The character roster is more or less as big as the last one with a twist though, each character has 3 different fighting styles. Something brought over from the PS2/XBOX/GameCUBE era of MK. Also they have increased the number of towers available compared to the single 300 challenges tower from the last MK. There's so much one can do with the offline content that online play can be completely ignored. The story mode is shorter than the last one but frankly speaking the real meat is in it the arcade mode and I am quite surprised to see people getting riled up over the short campaign in a fighting game. The only mode I wish to see return is the tag mode. It was quite fun in the last game.Online multiplayer seems to be a mixed bag and rightfully so because everyone runs on different ISPs. However compared to the last one this one is definitely better. I did manage to get a few games going with Australians and Indonesians. Lag was noticeable  but it was playable.In closing, this is a competent fighter which stands right next to Street Fighter, King of Fighters and Killer Instinct.

However, not all games are 10/10 100% perfect in everyway. When playing the story mode the game would challenge you to use different charecters evry 4th fight. and just as you are about to master someones abilities and learn all their combos, they change the characters on you. This kept the game interesting, annoying but interesting. You can challenge your friends in the arena without him even owning the game (On the same pc/keyboard). Had a mountain full of fun playing this game and i enjoyed it every bit."

It's not the fault of the game, it's the fault of Valve and their choice to do a streaming download of the game. I think it would be frankly quite stupid to think that any of this is the fault of Netherrealm as it is a distribution issue, not an actual game issue. (4/14 - 0Hrs)After playing half of the story mode, doing a Living Tower, and playing through most of the Krypt (Not unlocking, the Krypt in this has an adventure game-esque element to it) I really like this game. Each character having three variations means you have about 3 times the amount of characters that you can see, and each one really does have some uniqueness to them. Where the story of MK9 often made me cringe at the seriously bad writing, MKX's story is written a lot better. Tons of new characters, plenty of interesting stuff to do, after less than 24 hours the bumpy start of MKX should absolutely be outweighed by how fun MKX is. (4/15 - 9 Hrs)So, writing my final note, I think this is a really great game. You're probably going to want to play it with a friend locally, the story is a bit short (As usual) and just fighting the computer becomes pendantic after awhile, but I do think it's worth playing."

I feel like that proves how good the game is. GREAT story line, in my opinion. I never wanted to stop lpaying story. I never playedn 9, so I don't know if it had Towers, but I think that the Towers are really cool. The fighting, just watch the YouTube video, Mortal Kombat X All Fatalities. I saw that before I played the game, and I was screaming like a little girl because of the grossness. I LOVE IT. I still think you should go with the recommended stuff, just so that you can enjoy more. But if you don't have a computer that good, and can't/won't get one, I would just buy it anyway.

Why did you add a delay to the combinations ??

The game plays well, has a lot of variety, the story mode is a bit schlocky but fans of the series will probably expect that and it's still great fun.  It's the great game everyone hoped it would be, apart from one flaw.Unfortunately, it's the netcode again.  Significant improvements have been made over MK9 but sadly, about 70% of my games have either disconnected or been heavily laggy.  This is on a 72 Mb/s connection with all the required ports forwarded (without the port forwarding, everything is unplayalbe).  The 'Room' lobby system doesn't work particularly well, as there is no breakdown of regions and it seems as if the system designed to determine the ping time of people in the room doesn't seem to be working right now. There also doesn't seem to be any form of standard 1v1 Ranked Play other than a quick match system, which can dump you against any connection quality and you can't back out of it.  The frustrating upshot of this is that all the combos you spend time practicing against the AI are useless in the actual games most of the time and the order of the day in online play is projectile spam and random invincible specials because it's very difficult to block in time due to the lag.When it does work, though, it works *incredibly* well.  I've had one or two games where the response was flawless and it was great, so maybe it's more that something should be done about the match-making system rather than the netcode itself.  It just makes the majoprity of those matches all the more frustrating, though, because you know it should be so much better,This is just my experience; yours may vary, especially if you live in more densely populated areas and are more likely to find local opposition.  Moreover, I would still highly recommend this game even despite the general problems with the online gameplay because the amount of content and fun to be had here even without it working perfectly still justifies the purchase price IMO but all you online-only guys might consider waiting for a patch if this is prevalent."

Those who take a glance at the User Review Summary at the top should keep in mind that MKX was deeply in the red day 1, due to the fact that no one could play.That said, now that the cluster♥♥♥♥ of a launch has been fixed, the game plays extremely well with a few hiccups that I hope get fixed in patches. The gameplay is an overall improvement from MK9, with the combos flowing much smoother and better, and the overall gameplay being much faster. They removed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t bosses that don't get staggered from uppercuts like mini-boss Goro or Shao Kahn, and instead have the AI get kicked up a notch for those fights. Overall, there's more kontent than MK9, despite the exclusion of Tag-Team Kombat. With ladders of various kinds, and hourly-updated new ladders available if you have a net connection, it's a good time-sink.The Multiplayer suffers from a bit of lag, which is compensated as input lag on your end. While awkward, I'd prefer this over people just teleporting everywhere. As of writing, I know they're attempting to address this issue, but we'll see how well that goes. That said, the lag is still an improvement off of MK9's horrendous latency issues.All-in-all, MKX is a great game, that's a little battle-scarred by the launch and a few technical issues.

The single battle mode is great for killing some time before I have to do something else and the towers are great if I'm looking to burn away an afternoon.The only 'issue' I have, is that you have to unlock Fatalities and Brutalities. But even that's not a deal breaker because it's pretty much always been that way. Besides, it adds reason to explore the Krypt - which is now a 3D mini-adventure (AWESOME).Other than the above, the controls are simple and intuitive. The characters are reasonably diverse - no copy paste and reskin, for example - and the fatalities and X-Rays are as gory and nasty as ever.Perfect way to relieve some built-up anger too!"

A comprehensive summary of the pro's and con's from about 35 hours of playtime:Pro's:- A fully functional, capable fighting system which adds on Mortal Kombat 9's gameplay (which is arguably the most important part)- A good (for the most part) multiplayer mode, with a mostly good community (with a couple of annoying people)- Whilst not the greatest looking game in the world it has fairly good graphics (with a good amount of customisability from the menu)- LOTS OF GORE- A large amount of features to keep you playing: Factions, Faction Wars, Daily Challenges, Online Matchmaking, A Variety of Gamemodes, Living Towers (towers that change hourly, daily and weekly), Challenge Towers, and a bit more.- A nice selection of new characters and good returning characters- A solid story mode which introduces you to the game and into characters that you may have not played if you had not played the storyCon's:- There seems to be a large amount of lag online, whether that is serverside or problems with peoples' internet and location I don't know- The DLC is expensive and can seem a bit like a money grab (although that won't change my thoughts on the base game, P.S. Please nerf Jason)- Towers can sometimes seem a bit repetitive and sometimes just a bit annoying- Some character's are easily spammable, producing unrealistic win to loss ratios in ranked matchmaking (although there are no cheap characters, only cheap players)- JESUS CHRIST NETHEREALM, NERF UPPERCUTS- The story seems a bit shorter than what was found in MK9- A really bad launch, and apparently there are still some compatability issues. However, despite the fact that my MKX ran horribly for a while (I used a CPU fix in task manager) it now runs perfectly on full settings on my computer (which is just a bit above the recommended settings)- An option to buy everything in the Krypt for £15 Netherealm? Really?In all this is a very functional fighter which I enjoy greatly, possibly more than MK9 (judging from my playtime), it suffers from a few issues, the major ones have now been fixed, it looks good and plays well. For those who are judging this game on posts from lauch day, and posts ♥♥♥♥♥ing about DLC I would ask them to only take those into consideration when buying the DLC, the main game itself is very, and I mean very, good.-Greg Alpacca"

If you are an old school mk gamer, you won't have problems to get use to the techniques or attacks for each character, just practice your combos and you'll be more skillfull. The fatalities are pretty gore as always, the graphics are awesome. The story mode I found it a bit weak, comparing to MK 9 (2011), I hope the cliffhanger would be a great augury for the next MK game. The new characters have pretty effective techniques, so you'll have several options to choose your fighter. The only complaint I have in this game is the login, online and faction issues. After I installed this game, I couldn't login to my WBplay account and I couldn't use the network features, until the next day. So I hope the developers could fix that issue, because it's pretty annoying.In conclusion, this game is worth buying. You'll have so much fun playing it. I'll highly recommended it."

The optimization is the only thing really holding this game back.Having said that, despite the current PC issues, this game really is great. To give this game a thumbs down just because High Voltage failed at porting it, would be injustice in my opinion. Netherrealms really did make a good game, and it's receiving outstanding reviews for XboxOne and PS4. There's supposedly a patch coming today that fixes the PC version of the game (5/6/2015). If that fixes the issues with the PC version, this will easily become one of the best competitive games on Steam. If you like the Mortal Kombat series, you'll defnitely like MKX."

I'm really only dissapointed in the fact they don't have a lot of characters and are adding them in epxensive DLC's wth only one or four fihters a pop. Seriously, if you're going to start breaking lore to bring in rediculious stuff like Predetor and Jason Vorhees atleast start adding more Klassic characters.

,Recommended,307780,15805723,"Posted: 12 May, 2015",all,Captinsmelly987,"It's not Mortal Kombat. I'm not saying that's a bad thing either. I'll do different categories so this review is easier to navigate.GAMEPLAY:The base is the same, slap a bunch of buttons and look really cool (or hot in Scorpian's case) doing it. HERE'S THE CHANGE! I gotta say wow, the controls have gotten even more fluid. I no longer feel like I'm punished if I haven't studied a character's move list.  Most of the combo's go in a pattern like so: (Xbox One controller) X,X,Y. OR X,Y,X. OR A,B,B. Obviously there are longer more complicated combo's that will appeal to people who want to really learn a character from the ground up but now this appeals to someone like me who likes the idea of playing as everyone and not just a couple characters. The special moves usually fallow the same idea like they used to: DOWN, RIGHT, X. LEFT, RIGHT, X. You get the idea. Overall the gameplay is so fun to do now, which is good considering it's a video game.END OF GAMEPLAYSTORY:So we all know by now that MK's past stories have been mostly bad or confusing. That's not to say that there haven't been really good stories (I'm looking at you Deadly Alliance, HIGH FIVE) I'm just saying that I wasn't really expecting to be blown away by the story. I WASN'T BLOWN AWAY BY THE STORY. BUT. BUT BUT BUT. IT WAS REALLY GOOD. Just in case you're afraid of SPOILERS, you may want to skip to the next section. Story time! So we start off pretty much being a general badass and kicking the tar out of Shinnok which in turn makes you feel like a badass. You go through the game in MK9 fashion. You see different characters points of view while playing as them. Mostly near the end of the game the story scrolls over to the new kids. (I.E all the main characters children) You fight as them, you get to see the world come to the brink of destruction because Scorpion really needed to get revenge (I mean, fate of the world or feeling like you avenged your clan? Clan>Earthrealm every time) So Shinnok comes back and you're thinking ""Oh no big deal, I kicked his butt the first time"" WRONG. Shinnok gains Earthrealm's power source which in turn makes him crazily strong.  You do end up kicking his butt (or end up crying in fetal as he fondles your butt) and afterwards everything is great cause you know, you saved Earthrealm for like the 16th time. BUT WAIT, WHAT'S THAT THING?? OH MY GAHD NO. It's a cliffhanger and honestly if you didn't expect it then you haven't played Mortal Kombat enough. *Side note, Shinnok is spammy but he will never reach the spam level of some other bosses (IF YOU SHOULDER SLAM ME ONE MORE TIME SHAO KAHN I WILL EAT YOUR BABIES)END OF STORY.KRYPT:Wow. We upgraded from 2D sprites jump scaring us to having spiders humping out faces with all of their polygonal beauty. So the Krypt is honestly my favorite Krypt of all time, I would venture to say that this is the best Krypt EVER. (But that's just m opinion.) It's a 3D world that you can walk along little invisible tracks and use your gold you fished off of Sonya's dead corpse to get stuff with. It's so well made that I really can't say too much bad other than performace occasionally falls.END OF KRYPTPersonal Problems:This is my favorite Mortal Kombat so it pains me to say that I actually hate something about it, and it's not inherently it's fault. It's becoming common place among new video games to incorporate your extra devices and I'm all for it.  I stop being all for it when the only way to unlock a costume is to have an expensive phone that's Apple or Android.  I have a Nokia Lumia 1520, it's a windows phone. It has a terrible marketplace but it has an awesome camera. Why should I be punished because I didn't choose a more popular phone? Why should someone with not enough money for an expensive new phone get left out of a cool mechanic of the game? I already know what you're thinking because I thought it. ""Why are you buying games if you can't afford a phone?"" and that makes sense, BUT. But why should a $60 dollar game turn into $60+$100 (lower price for android phones)? That's not fair, I shouldn't have to spend extra money to unlock stuff in a game I already paid for.OVERALL:This game is fantastic and I would recommend it 10 times over. Nuff said."

Ive played 3 days straight straight already on PS4 and i couldnt recommend anything better when you are looking for a fun new game with lots of content. the only problem is it is a fighting game and some dislike or find it repetitive.Verdict: if you just serpass the recommended requirements you can probably play it easily on lowest graphics.

The online is poor with frequent crashes and the port is also very poor with some maps having a solid 60 fps with some other maps like sky temple being very poor.

I mean, I like a good cheesy film or game from time to time, but it almost seemed like NetherRealm was intentionally having characters make completely stupid decisions. If you played through the MK 2011 story mode, then played this one, you might kind of feel like you just watched the first Mortal Kombat movie, then had to put up with Mortal Kombat: Annihilation.The story focuses mostly on the Cage family, though it does branch out to other characters a la MK 2011. It does a decent job of introducing us to the 'next generation' of fighters - Kenshi's son, Jax's daughter, Kung Lao's nephew (I think), and Johnny Cage/Sonya Blade's daughter. It also does a good job of making us hate them all.I get that whoever wrote the story wanted to show the new characters as flawed, yet still heroic. Unfortunately, they did such a good job of making them flawed that, in my opinion, they crossed the line from 'flawed' to 'unlikeable'. Heck, one of them risks an inter-dimensional war by barging in and interfering with Outworld traditions.Scenes that are meant to be emotional are just kind of cringe-worthy, then immediately forgotten as the next foe comes forward.There are some bright spots here and there, and several of the new characters are rather interesting, though a few get disappointingly little background (Erron Black, for example).But hey, this is a fighting game. How is the fighting?Pretty darn good. I admit I'm no expert at judging how good fighting games are these days, but as someone who once won a regional Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 tournament back when arcades were still a thing, I can honestly say I enjoy playing this, and it's fun to figure out a new combo. The fighters all seem pretty balanced overall, and I really don't miss the tag feature from MK 2011 (which is missing in this game).OVERALL:Recommended! As much as I tore the Story Mode apart, I still enjoy the game and all it has to offer. There is a lot to do here. I do hope better writers are hired for the next game, but it isn't enough to detract from a recommendation."

But I guess what I'm saying is, I wanted something like MK9 with the graphics of MKX, I wanted to see what happened, the end of this fight with the nether and the start of the next with some other antagonist, All the characters I saw in the old game and some new ones, not all this faction crap, not the krypt (my god the krypt is just awful) but it is mortal kombat, and the fights are still good, and the game is still good, just not as good as I had hoped. I dont wish I didnt buy it, but I do wish I got more out of it, I played MK9 at least a couple times a week since I got it, and I still play it. I have played this game for a week, and I honestly don't see myself playing much if at all moving forward."

X-Rays are awesome as they were in MK9. As for the story its generally the same with any fighting game, lots of cutscenes and faction vs. faction fights. This does not however take away from the game's quality.Here is where the problems kick in. The online mode its alright, with a selection on player vs player ranked and unranked matches, teamfights (which never get played) ect... The connection to other players and the servers in general is really bad. With a 15gb update a few days ago, it really didnt fix anything online. Games will freeze halfway through fighting and even in the character select screen!Aside from the fighting, the Krypt also has a few issues. Some areas wouldnt work for others and in my case I had around 10k coins which wouldnt go down or go up whenever currency was spent or recieved (this was fixed via restart).Positives+ Great Graphics+ Smooth offline gameplay+ Plenty of characters and movesets+ X-Rays (Duh!)+ Juggle combos and jiggle physics!!Negetives- Bad connection to servers and players- Krypt bugs and glitches- No obvious ELO system or ranking system at all- As of 25/04/2015 there is no Smoke, Rain, Cyber Sub-Zero or Cyrax and no baraka!!!A few more online patches and bug fixes would boost it up to a 9 or 10.Overall I would give Mortal Kombat X 8/10."

However, now that the game is working I do have to say that this is a lot of fun to play. The story is full of cinematics and can become quite lengthy in my opinion, but it's fun to play. It's all about the faction you join and the coins you earn. If you want to unlock more fatalites, brutalities, etc.... you have to play the game, earn the coins and hit the Krypt. Massive amount of characters to play with and I can certainly see this being expanded in the long run. At the moment, you may not get to play some of your old favorites, but you do get to see them. I think, if they took the time to model them, then they'll take the time to make them playable down the line. Personally I'd like to be able to play as Rain,,,,, but with a better outfit. Oh, and all of this is said without having spent a single moment online against another real person. I'll burn that bridge when I get there."

It introduces character fighting techniques that allow each character to be played in different ways which can come across as more playability or to some a daunting task to master. The story mode has about 3 - 4 hours of awesome cinematic cutscenes and a range of different characters that are playable as you progress. This game also introduces a new faction mode in which you pick a faction and play a variety of different modes to gain points in order for your faction to win over the others. And finally NetherRealm Studios have turned it up to 11 on the Fatalities and produced some of the most gruesome but rewarding fatality animations you will ever see.Well that was the good stuff ^^To appreciate those awesome aspects though you must understand the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that producers like Warner Bros force upon a game when it comes to release. To begin everybody knew Goro was coming and playable in MKX but upon release to play this character you had to pay $5.00 USD yet you already had downloaded him. As well the fatalities that are just amazing have also been made easy but that is not where I am concerned, the fact that you can purchase these easy fatalities for real money as well as unlock all the Krypt items for a price is just disgraceful for the overall difficulty of the game and fans who pride themselves in achieving these unlocks and mastering these moves. Finally this game had some issues upon launch, graphical problems for some users and still has online issues which should have been fixed after the previous games issues.That being said though, the game is great! It is just disappointing that we still have issues like this and these micro-transactions are still present in games today.Awesome fighting game 9/10"

For anyone who has been following the franchise or even those returning from MK 1 2 and 3 I think the story and gameplay are fantastic. The only issues I have with this game are the usual PC port problems and they go as follows.30 FPS on Fatalitys and XRAYS?!?!?!? The FPS war will wage on people saying what the eye can see and can't see. I can and this game going from 60 to 30 drives me crazy.  .  .  SLI 100fps+ PLZAnother huge Issue is the game doesn't use GPU AT ALL. The fans on my 980s almost never turn on while playing this game because it's just not doing anything on the gpus, My cpu on the other hand is going crazy (TOASTY!). I have FX 8350 4.8Ghz game runs great but comon guys we spend the big bucks on our SLI setups becuase thats where PC gaming happens. PLEASE USE THE GPU's!!!!!!!!Lastly in the last MK9 and this game the cinematics are not ingame modles and the blury feel is highly anoying when you go from 1440 to fuzzy fuzzy.Outside of the fact somehow the tech side of the port kinda sucks I have to admit the story (as a fan) really entertained me. I love the addition of the button push sequenses in the story mode. The overall feel of the game is good. The pace isn't as fast as I was hoping for but it actually seems to give the game a more dynamic kinda feel where ""button mashing"" is the last thing you want to do (even for new players)If anyone at NetherRealm See's this PLEASE unlock the frames on the game !!!!! Xrays and Fatalitys too!!!!!!!!! PELASE!!!!!!"

The fact that they brought characters from the ""dark age"" of MK (alas the ones from N64 'till PS2) such as Shinnok was particularly annoyingfor me.As characters go, can't help but feel a lack of them on the selection screen. It is a noticeable step down from the MK9 roster. Kind of the difference between UMK3 and MK2, except back then the cartridges could be blamed, even if as an excuse.The new ""fighting styles"" didn't please me either, I liked it better when the charactes didn't have identity crisys that affected their gameplay.The graphics are good, shame it needs so much power to be seen. This game is quite heavy for its style.It is still Mortal Kombat thought, and while not among the best, as a fan it does bias my opinion and I will spend some time playing it (who knows, maybe some of the innovations will grow on my taste) so overall I'd give it a 7/10"

The variations are fun to play even if some kinda feel gimmicky.And the fatalities are awesome. Yes, there is a 30 FPS lock on the intros/X-rays/fatalities, but I really don't mind at all. It does feel more cinematic, and doesn't affect the gameplay in any way. I get why they chose this visual approach.The brutalites are also a very nice touch, and it's cool to find out what are the conditions to land them.I also like the new chara design, feels a lot cooler, and it's nice to see some great new female characters (Kitana's Assassin variation looks really cool too!).I'm having some issues finding people with good ping online (the ping icon keeps on loading all the time), so I hope some people living in Japan might read this review and add me for some fun fights ;)"

The problem comes when you are playing, trying to pull combos and everything is fine one second, then another second everything just goes to 14-20fps, becomes like slow-motion while AI is making some mashed potatos out of you.P.S. I've tried most of the ""FIX"" options you can find online, none helped.2nd ISSUE: Controller support for non-xbox controllers is quite♥♥♥♥♥♥ spent A LOT of time (maybe another 3 hours) looking for a solution on how to use a generic usb controller (yes yes, I know x360ce, but even that sh*t doesn't work as intented on this lame-a** port).For anyone who's gonna try to accuse me of owning a potato computer, here are my specs:CPU: 6700k OC'ed to 4.2Ghz,GPU: GTX 1070 G1 Gaming edition (OC'ed by 10%)RAM: Ripjaws IV 2x8GB @ 3200HzHDD (where the game is installed): Seagate Barracude 2TB, 7200rpmTl;dr: Benchmark runs smooth at 60fps on Ultra settings; massive stuttering and fps drops (down to 14-20) in the actual game, probably because of cutscenes/special moves that are hardcoded to be shown at 30fps.NO GUARANTEED-TO-WORK ""FIX"" available as of yet, and probably will never be.Personally, I would prefer this game much more than SF or other mainstream fighting games, since it's a bit more general-audience friendly in terms of combo moves, etc. + realistic graphics are way more appealing to me than SF (personal opinion).

It has a surprisingly large amount of cut scenes inbetween fights in story mode. Now back in the 90s and 2000s cut scenes were used to show graphics far beyond what the hardware was capable of displaying in real time. But now in Mortal Kombat X they're rendered at lower quality than what the game engine is capable of displaying on max settings, and what is even worse is that the cut scenes were rendered at 1080p! So this game looks horrible for the 5 - 10 minute long cut scene in between every fight, and then looks absolutely beautiful when it switches to the game's rendering engine at 4k resolution. I bet console plebs and their untermensch hardware are somehow to blame for this."

It's a pretty rotten thing to do.However...I bought this game after the drop of support had already been announced, so I knew what I was getting into on that front. And once I got past that, I've been more than amazed by the game. I've been an MK fan since I was a teenager playing the original arcade cabinets, and this is easily up there with MK2 and MK9 as the best games in the franchise. Graphics and sound are excellent, the level of detail is ridiculous (just watch some of the stories play out in the backgrounds and you'll see what I mean), and the combat system is easy to pick up yet deep. It's a rare fighting game that both amateurs and hardcore players can excel at, and I much prefer the a la carte combat system in this game to one where I have to push eight buttons in a row or nothing happens.Also - the living towers in this are genius. Just genius. Sometimes, if I have a few minutes but not enough to play a ton, I'll log on and see what the hourly tower is, play it, then go about my day.I've logged almost 20 hours and I've only finished half the story and played with half the characters (only a few with all three forms). I've only truly mastered Kitana, and there are even a bunch of her moves/kombos that I haven't fully explored yet. I'm so excited to keep trying new things, and it's going to take me a long, wonderful time to get to it all. The amount of content is staggering.So bottom line - if the abandonware issue is a deal-breaker, the don't get it and I won't blame you. But if you can live with it, this is truly one of the best fighting games I've played in forever, and it is worthy of the MK name."

,Recommended,307780,21546263,"Posted: 29 February, 2016",all,Raiine,"edit 03.18.2017I had to share my opinion on the game I spent more than a half of a thousand of hours on and I feel that I have my mind settled now. This is the second revision of this review, updated as the game received all the latest content only available on consoles before. The reason it does have poor approval rating from other users is because I praised the game even in times of temporary abandonment by developers. I also haven't had any particularly big issues with it since the very launch, and I feel sorry for those who have.To the point though. What I have to say about this game is that it is, literally, the best Mortal Kombat game ever made. In both game design and gameplay sense. I'm old enough to witness UMK3 and yet I say what I say. So here are my thoughts on it:The roster provides us with a nice mix of good old and brand new characters. Some might be upset over not having their favorite characters from previous games here, but you certainly can't satisfy everyone. Counting 33 characters with 3 variations each gives us 99 variations overall. That's a lot. Still, even 33 characters don't mean there are 33 different playstyles: some characters are more or less similar to each other.It is pretty well balanced — at least comparing to previous NRS games. Of course, there are still weak and strong characters and the variation system isn't 100% perfect to say the least as there are still useless variations among the cast. Nevertheless, there are no dead matchups, and there are debates going on on who's the top or bottom tier in MKX (nevermind your favorite YOMI boyz tier list breh) — and it was before the latest balance patch even released. Don't even bother sorting out middle-tier characters.The gameplay won't let you get bored. It became notably harder in execution than before — that is, in performing combos or some other techs, but nothing too overcomplicated. The biggest issue here are some weird inputs like cancels or command grabs or so, but you can get used to it. There are interactable objects on arenas and they are extremely useful. Considering the number of characters there could be many different tactics, which is obviously good. At the same time MKX tends to have strong accent towards the pressure game — that is, on both offensive and defensive side. The usual gameplan across the cast is to carry your opponent all the way to the corner so you can knock him down and stuff his wakeup, and the most common mindgame is whether or not to armour out through the string gaps.The netcode. With the latest improvement it is much better now than that of MK9's or IGAU's and ranked/casual matchmaking is very fast.Greatly improved graphics (mind your hardware!), sound effects and overall design. It is dark (the issue here is that it can be literally too dark on some arenas), it is brutal, it is beautifully disgusting. For once, female characters don't look like pumped up transgenders and males aren't plastic action figures anymore, too. Colored ninjas never had that much of individuality before.Lots of content: incorporated framedata, fighting modifiers, cinematic story, krypt, towers, events, challenges, character costumes, fatalities and brutalities (including the secret ones, some of which may still remain to be found yet), different playing modes. Though not everything apart from practice could be as useful in sense of training (comparing to other fighting games like Guilty Gear and it's Missions and Challenges).Mortal Kombat X has a lot of typical NRS bullcrap to it (gameplay-wise), but it is still quite fun to play. Good graphics and grotesque violence — there is no such game on a market and there won't be until MK11 is released. So if you're into it — there's no reason to hesitate buying it."

Like they have changed the commands for special moves, for example Scorpion´s spear is not anymore back, back, low punch. The kontrols are karbage. Give me even an option to use klassic kontrols. It feels more like Injustice than Mortal  Kombat.Then they have added some random filler characters in the game, like there is Sonya, Sub-Zero, Scorpion and Goro and then there is like 10 characters what I have never heard of. Why you replace klassic kharacters with some some random ones who doesn´t even belong in the game ? And Predator, Alien and Jason completely pointless, not Suitable characters for this type of a game.And why there is no difficulty selection in tower mode ? I have to play against those super fast combo spamming opponents with messed up controls, nice, a brilliant game desing !And there no sense of progression in the game, like there is no unlockable characters in the game, how cool that would be if every arcade mode playthrough unlocks some klassic kharacter like Baraka, Cyrax, Sektor, Human Smoke, Motaro etc. But no there isn´t anything like that.Also the game stutters badly sometimes."

,Recommended,307780,21314549,"Posted: 19 February, 2016",all,davidspackage,"Mortal Kombat X builds solid work on the goodwill established by Mortal Kombat 9 (MK Komplete Edition here on Steam). Much effort has been poured into building up the character of the MK universe, fleshing out the various realms and inter-character relationships. A new crop of characters has been added, and despite three being children of pre-existing characters, they're all a worthwhile addition. Which is great news, because aside from a few new faces like Kenshi, there hasn't been a new MK character worth the disk space for a very long time. Fatalities and X-rays are more ridiculously brutal than ever, each character has three different special move varieties to increase replayability (hard to think characters used to have just two or three special moves), and a series of towers, challenges and online play round things out. Story mode is challenging, but probably the best part of the game.With all that praise, it's a shame that WB apparently pulled the plug on supporting the game for PC. That means no more patches and no additional DLC characters, which are reserved for the console versions. Not that I particularly mind that last one, as the DLC characters are kind of outrageously priced at € 5 a character. Aside from that, I really enjoyed unlocking the various concept art entries in the Krypt, but this takes such a long time to do, that the fact that you can buy an unlock for the entire Krypt for € 20 puts a really bad taste in my mouth. All in all, I would be very wary of purchasing a Mortal Kombat X successor on PC, which is a damn shame because that's not going to change the publisher's mind on PC releases."

I love the alternate timeline from the original games and how the characters have evolved with different forms for different playstyles. I don't like that the depth of characters available is taken away from because of it. Unlike street fighter, not every character was using almost the same fireball (ryu, ken, akuma, dan, sakura, gouken.) There was a mass of different fighters with different abilities and styles in MK that didn't make an appearance. With that said, if your enjoyed MK and have been immersed in the universe, this is a fair addition."
76561198116703474,Recommended,307780,20690587,"Posted: 22 January, 2016",all,Helios,"This game has seen a lot throughout its lifetime on PC. In the beginning, it was nothing but a glitch fest with optimization errors, crashes and unplayable online. Things have come a long way though. The studio that Nether Realm hired to create the PC port has really changed things from launch day. Optimization is acceptable and a hell a lot better than launch day. Now player have benchmarks in the video options to test out graphical settings. In addition, players have fps meters online. So you can see what fps your oppenent is playing at. Thus you can avoid players with weaker systems and save yourself trouble with lag and such. Speaking of lag, the game is still really hard to play online because of the input delay. I find my self dropping delicate combos with air tight timings frequently online. Its a pain in the a$$ but you get used to it with time. You just have to know your combos very well to input them before they actually play out. But something that you can't really account for with online lag is punishing certain moves. Like Sub Zeros b2, which is normally easily punishable by attacks that are 12 frames or less. But because the attack pushes you back on block, you have to run in and attack. Still easy though. But the input delay, delays your attack ever so slightly that you can't quite punish something that is normally should. If you try and fail, Sub Zero can catch you and full combo you. But after time you will know what attacks are punishable online and what aren't. Its a matter of time. HOWEVER, Nether Realm Studios has addressed this major issue in the Mortal Kombat Community by introducing a netcode system for online called the GG PO. It is a roll back netcode that will be used in the upcoming titles Street Fighter 5, Injustice 2 and Mortal Kombat 11. It will completely DESTROY any input lag problems in online matches. There is currently a closed beta running and so far the results are jaw breaking. The characters in this game are AMAZING. There is so much depth in each and every character avaliable. And even more depth in each varation of the same character. Effectivly tripling the cast. In addition, new mechanics were introduced in mkx that we never saw before. Such as running, run cancels, reversals, FRAME DATA WRITTEN IN THE GAME (Thank you Nether Realm Studios) and interactables. These take some time to get used to for mk9 veterans, but not very time consuming. I find combos harder to pull of on keyboard in mkx appossed to mk9. Especially the jump teleports but again, it comes down to practice in order to perfect. If you have a controller, then you less worrying for you. The game was designed for controllers and thus you should have a better time. None the less, keyboard is still do able. I am personally a keyboard player and have no problem DESTROYING controller players.  In the end, if you are into strategy and depth, this is the game for you. The problem is that this might be a bit overwhelming for newer players. So in conclusion, get this game if you are able to put up with the frustration of complexity and online lag... for a short while, after which you, will become a pro and DOMINATE EVERYONE. Plus online lag is getting fixed soon so thats one less thing to worry about.9/10 till online gets fixed. 10/10 kappa after the online gets fixed."

Aside from a rather weak story mode there is nothing wrong with the actual game.Now that that's out of the way, the PC version still has some issues which I won't get into, there are plenty of discussions on that subject. I would recommend the game, but if you can I suggest getting a console copy. All of the bugs are pretty much nonexistent on those versions.

Sadly favorites like Noob Saibot, Smoke and many others from the last game are not present. Gladly most of the important classic characters are included. This may or may not be a turnoff for some.The game is noticably darker looking than the last game and goes for a more realistic look compared to the last one. No more bright colors and huge boobies. I think the art direction is mostly positive..The story mode is a bit shorter, but not as short as some people say. I still have my old runthough video from the last game and it took me 4 hours and 22 minutes after the credit roll. This new game took me 3 hours and 43 minutes.The story continues from the last game, in the new timeline set by Raiden. If you loved the older Mortal Kombat games from the 90s and for some reason did not play the last game, I would highly recommend that you play through that story first. It feels very nostalgic with a few twists, as Raiden has knowledge of the future.Since this story is a continuation it does not have the same nostalgic effect, but is still worth playing through.Thankfully even if some ""important"" characters died or somehow ""changed"" in the last story mode, this have not prevented Netherrealm from including them in this game. There were some characters that I would have surely missed if they had not been included. And even if they may or may not be a huge part in the new story there are some very much enjoyable arcade endings for theese characters as well.Every characters have 3 variations that adds different special attacks and often alters their move set a bit. If you look closely every variation also changes that characters appearance. Which variation you choose will also affect each costume.The new Mortal Kombat is just as gory as it always have been (if you discount the Nintendo censored version of the first game, hehe). The X-Ray system from the last game is still present and there are Fatalities, Brutalities and the new Faction kills.The faction kills are unlocked as you level up your faction, they are easy to perform, can be used on every character and are unique for each faction. If you play regularly, leveling up a faction is relatively fast. There is even a achivement for leveling all factions up. Keep in mind that you will loose all your faction progress if you leave.For some reason they dropped the Stage Fatalities from the last game and seems unwilling to give us Friendships and Bablities.. If you play online and your opponent rage quits you get a Quitality!In case you are wondering, this game is not ment for kids.The gameplay is as you might expect from a Mortal Kombat game. Two opponents beat each other to death, best of three rounds, fatality!It is worth mentioning that the 2 player Tag mode have been removed. Instead we have group fights, these requires 3 or 4 people teams. If you only have 1 friend who is about your level in fighting games, you will have to do with single matches against each other or if you both feel like it ""king of the hill"" mode. There are no way for 2 friends to play together on a team against other players online and I think that is a shame.There are a few negative things that I feel is worth mentioning:- 15 GB patches! Patches for this game comes in the awesome sizes of about 15GB.. If you have a slow internet connection or your internet provider limits the amount you can download, this will probably be more than a minor annoyance,..- Performance problems for many people. I have not personally witnessed this but the forums are full of people crying for their high end rigs and low fps (frames per secound)...- The online play suffers because of theese problems as the game uses peer to peer. If you are to fight someone with low or unstable fps, the game will slow down or lag for you too. There is also alot of talk about the bad netcode beeing better on the consoles, could be related to some pcs not running at 60fps...- Requires iOs/android app to unlock some awesome (I think must have) costumes. This is horribly bad because the mobile game is of the now sadly common ""pay to win"" type. It has gameplay even worse than thoose old ""Tiger handheld LCD games"" from the 80s and mid 90s.  This modern mobile game does not require any skill, only money or lots of time grinding. Tap, tap finger slide is a perfect description of the gameplay, and wait for energy to come back. The graphics are prettier than toose older inferior mobile ports though. But like mentioned, even worse gameplay. Put your phone in the R-Zone and you will probably suffer the ultimate low of gaming possible."

They have made a new generation of characters such as Cassie Cage and her parents are Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade obviously. There is countinuous new DLC characters such as Tanya which is another awesome revamped character and some awesome characters outside of the game like Predator and Jason Vorhees. the story line is interactive in cutscenes which is awesome. I have played lots of games for a long time and although it is high on the gory scale it is mostly about saving the world and the competetivity that makes this game fun I give it a 8/10 for the remarkable graphics coupled with the creative fatalities and gameplay. Also it is still contantly updating so it has still a lot more to come!

Way too many bland characters in the roster, along with some really weird design decisions. For some reason they decided to drop all the sexy monsters and robot ninjas that made Mortal Kombat 2011 fun, and then had to turn up the violence from brutal to full blown sadism to compensate. Combine that with having several members of the same family as playable characters, and you get a pretty unsettling game.I don´t know, something about seeing Jax rip his own teenage daughters head off and putting out his cigar in her exposed neck hole.. It kinda put me off in a big way. And this is comming from a pretty jaded gamer mind you.Anyway, I much prefer the campy over-the-top sexy comic violence of MK 2011 to the sadistic mother-father-daughter murder galore that MKX became, at least to me.So good bye Mortal kombat, for now. Bring back the age of robot ninjas, and I will return."

Forgiving and forgetting are two different things, and I like many other PC gamer's will not forget what type of crap game was released to us at the beginning. Never again will this studio get my money in advance for a game, or the day of release. Well i do enjoy the game now, but it was a month and a half of owning the game before it was fixed enough to where I could play it. I give this a thumbs up now, because the fighting is good and we can now enjoy what we were wanting and expecting at the beginning.

And plus the devs are being really greedy because of the plethora of dlc they made i mean sure some of it is in the kombat pack but thats still 30$ USD and plus the kombat pack still doesnt come with all the dlc.TLDR: IMO dont buy the game the devs are greedy and its really buggy atm

Mortal Kombat X's Online there and there is yet still flawed despite when I play online my display drivers die and recover everytime, but there and there the game is good.

The game by all means is not that flawed. Exeptionally the game's training does increase skill quite fast, and complex combos, well for me are easy to learn and remember and I don't have to pause in between every move. You can get good quick. You don't have to go ""Are You ♥♥♥♥ing Kidding Me?"" kind of guy and/ or meme. Though Jason is my main, all characters are not that complex to learn.

A mistake some people make is turning on frame smoothing. ONLY use it if there is not possible way for you to make game run at more than 30 fps, otherwise it will just make the lag worse. The launch isn't really as bad as people say, and I think this game is worth giving a chance to. Even the keyboard controls aren't bad, and in my opinion, are easier than the console controllers (some people still might say otherwise), but if you want you can still plug in a USB controller, which is what I do when my friends come over. Only the intro cutscenes are the ones that get most of the lag, but everything else, gameplay and storymode cutscenes, are very smooth after you adjust the settings.

At this point though,it's pretty shaky on lower spec systems due to it's poor optimization.It's basically the Crysis of Fighting Games on the PC so I'd recommend being on par or above the recommend specs if you plan on buying the game in the future.Just be sure to do your homework first to avoid wasting you time and money on a game you can't run.But Hey,steam refund is a thing now so you should be fine anyway.Update 1 6/20/15:Previous dev in charge of the port High Voltage is being replaced by a new dev Q.L.O.C. In case you're wondering they're the guys who ported Ultra Street Fighter 4 and Street Fighter x Tekken to the Pc.The Future is starting to look better for this game."

Nope, launched and hung again. ♥♥♥♥ing pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥60 dollar piece of junk. I want my ♥♥♥♥ing money back!Update 4/27: Changing my recommendation again. Still no patch to fix the awful performance issues that render this game almost unplayable, especially online.Overall So Far: Changing my recommendation. I have hopes for this game's online features and am enjoying the offline content I have so far been able to play.Review of Story Mode: I have had some time to play story mode and I can't base the entire review off of one bad experience. So far the game has been very enjoyable during story mode. The graphics are awesome, the fights (for me) are challenging yet passable and I assume will become easier with practice. I have not played any fighting games in years so I anticipated I was up for a steep learning curve.As part of the story mode the transition from cinematic to 1 button combat sequences to actual fights has been pretty seamless. I generally have to pause for minute with each new character to gain a simple understanding of their fighting style. Other than that I have felt rather immersed in a fairly gripping story that is well animated and action packed.Having not completed the story or experienced much else in the game thus far I will leave my review open. For now I am intrigued in what's to come and entertained by what I have. If you're a person sitting on the edge reading this trying to make a determination and you got $60 - $90 to blow I would sa go for it. If your somewhat leaning on waiting I would say at least wait until most of the issues are resolved and the online services are fully functional. With all that said, please continue the rest of this review with a grain of salt. It was a frustrating day and although vocal, what I say is true about the experience.EDIT Initial Review on Launch Day: Woo hoo and I thought because I pre-ordered, downloaded early and grew in anticipation that my eagerly waiting would pay out for once with a video game. So much for that idea. It tells me it is supposed to be downloading but instead crashed and appears to not be making any progress. Agree with everybody else. Nice menu.EDIT After attempt to troubleshoot issues: I had to visit WB's website to see if they had any information on the issues. I was greeted with a KB article immediately describing the crashing issue. I was actually quite surprised that they would already have such an article on their website. Curious to see what kind of suggestions they had and eager to apply the fixes I entered to article, only to be bombarded with help desk crap blaming me, the consumer of the faulty product. Like it is my fault my car’s breaks gave out the day I bought it and as a result killed 3 innocent people. With my greats skills of deduction I quickly ruled out every suggestion with a simple process of elimination. Does any other game I have ever played on my computer do this.... hmm nope? Do I meet the standards and flat out blow them away.... hmmm yep. Ok thanks for wasting my time even beyond the annoyance of the crashing game, forcing me to continue to bad mouth a game I haven't even played. If only you hadn't made me feel like a killer just by visiting your website. Wish I could have put that emotion to good use in the game designed specifically for such emotions.EDIT AGAIN Next day: Have been playing for a little while today. Been able to complete the tutorial and even a single fight. Click online and boop game crashed again. Ugh...."

I didn't have any trouble with the matchmaking, although I did get a bit of slow down on one occasion during each of my games (didn't stop me from getting my♥♥♥♥♥whipped). There's tonnes of challenges both 'on the disc' and set daily via online updates, as well as a story mode similar to MK9, and a number of variations on the classic tower mode. The game looks utterly fantastic as well, and is heads and shoulders about MK9 in terms of graphical fidelity.However, and of course there's a however because GAMES THESE DAYS, there are a few issues. Firstly, whilst gameplay is 60fps all cutscenes, X-ray scenes and fatality scenes are 30fps, which is both jarring, and utterly baffling. Scratch that, it's utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I felt much better about it when I realised it wasn't my framerate dropping but it was built into the game, but it's still ridiculous that you cut from silky smooth 60fps during a fight, to performing an X-Ray move at half that, before the game skips back to 60 when the fight resumes. Why. WHY? 60fps was good enough for MK9, why not this one? And I swear to god if someone says 'it's cinematic' I'm gonna explode. What does that word mean? Because I'm pretty sure I don't notice films skipping frames, yet here with a side-by-side comparison built into the game it's hard not to miss, and harder not to be dumbfounded by the decision. Secondly, there is some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t costly DLC skins and characters. More insultingly, the characters are visible but blacked out on the character selection screen, taunting you with their presence. On top of that, you fight some of the DLC characters in game, which is an even more egregious way of dangling the carrot in front of you.BUT, apart from these annoying design choices/business practices, the game is a great MK game. The fatalities are more brutal than ever, the loading screens are negligible, the different play styles for the characters open up a whole new world of personalisation for the players, and there is still a fair amount of unlockable content that one can gain access to through gameplay. I especially love that some of the fatalities are hidden, so you have to hop on the internet to find out what the codes are, or unlock them in game. It's not quite the same as having to buy a magazine or ask your friends, but the sentiment is there, and it feels much more like the kind of arcade MK experience that most fans of the originals remember so fondly.I wasn't sure about this game for months, but apparently it's a lot better now that it used to be in terms of technical integrity, and I'm just loving playing it."

I got 6 Ranked Wins by the way because of people disconnecting because of the unstable ping. but I know all of the players here also address this issue, but its been awhile since this release, you guys should fix this thing.one more suggestion, i doubt this wont happen but if someone from NRS read this, if your kind enough, please make this game cross-platform, it might help. just sayin'.even though the online a bit suck, i gotta say, buy this game, its fun, but i totally recommend the console versions as the online is very much stable there, however ive been hearing that it is worse than the pc version but meh, buy both versions :PEDIT: PC SUPPORT RIP, DONT BUY THIS GAMEEDIT 2: BOIS WE GETTIN' MKXL, BUY THIS GAME!So, It's been a year since we got that mediocre port of MKX. I was very much disappointed and dismayed by the fact that KP2 will not release on PC when NRS confirmed that starting KP2, PC support is not happening. I Thought all hope is gone to be honest but when they announced the Beta test for MKXL, I WAS OVERJOYED. Not just because of KP2 and the netcode but of how the whole game had changed into an impressive port. I get 60fps stable and rarely goes to 50fps at Max Settings while before, i get 30fps at medium low. Actually I still have a small problem regarding to connection but i can see the difference of netcode because of how terrible the old one was. I have yet to see the real improvement of this as i have a rather low connection in the game. but then i hope they would resolve it on release or later in the beta as i had post a support ticket regarding this. But then i have a decent experience of GGPO so i could actually hypothesize that this netcode is going to be excellent. So, That being said, MKX is better now than that of last time and so im revoking my negative recommendation into a recommend.TL;DR: last 2015, PC support rip, no KP2, bad performance & netcode. But now, PC support is here, Yes KP2, Yes MKXL, 60fps stable it never goes below 50fps, GGPO netcode but have yet to see its potential since my net is bad. Buy The Game :)"

Like many of Mortal Kombat players, I started with the very first one, loved MKII but was driven away by the quality of some later installments. The franchise had been revitalized at least a couple times. Mortal Kombat X certainly is the best MK I have played so far.Pros:+Responsive control+Excellent story mode that introduces interesting new characters. The script and screenplay, in my opinion, is better then the two MK movie I had watched ages ago. It is the best story mode in any fighting game I have played. Neverrealm Studio likely had got a helping hand from Warner Bros+Beautiful graphics. I remember MK9 on my PS3 looked quite good so I booted it up to take a look. It was fine by last generation standard but MK X really looks a generation ahead. For now, MK X is the best looking fighter this generation.+Of course there is the krypt and other play modes but I don't really care about those.Cons:-Compared to other long running fighting franchises and MK9, the number of playable characters in MK X is not large. When you play the story mode you will fight a few characters from the MK universe that are not available in any play mode. Example, Tanya and Rain. I can already see they will be sold separately as DLC's.-Problem at launch (on Steam). The initial complications are long gone and the game is running stable on my PC but still have to mention it.-More Stages. This game looks so good that I just wish there were a couple more stages to fight in. Apparently missing is the stage on a high bridge where you can perform stage fatality.Other thoughs:Overall I am happy with MK X.My system is an i7 2600k, 16GB ram, GTX970 4 GB, Windows 7 Home Premium. The game runs smoothly during fight, I guess fps is 40 or more (don't know how to display fps). During cut scenes in story mode there were micro stutters occasionally but they lasted for half a second. It doesn't happen very often so I am fine with that."

On console I heard it was fine but here, basically Steam used a new download system that downloaded the game's content in patches. It ♥♥♥♥ed♥♥♥♥♥♥up but we're past that. Now the port itself has been behind the console cousins often crashing and stuff. There has been a patch to fix this and it wiped memories GOOD JOB. I thankfully was not there to download the patch so yeah they released it again without the deleting effect, thought the damage was already done. So lets get on with the actual game.The story I feel was kinda short and a bit disapointing compared to MK9. There were some loop holes like why tf Cassie Cage was able to beat a powered up Shinnok while getting her♥♥♥♥♥handed to her with everyone else in the story. They made the bad guys as weak as♥♥♥♥♥♥and some character like Aaron Black and Ferrah Torr are in it for 4 seconds, please don't tell they're the new Barakas. Although it was a bit disappointing it isn't a COD story so it'll keep you interested as u play the game.The gameplay is easily the best in the franchise. It is really smooth and fast while the gameplay in MK9 was kind of stiff like there were locked into their fighting pose and couldn't move on their own. Variations are cool I wouldn't say that they make the game feel like it has 75 characters that too far. They stop single characters (ex. Scorpian) from being too op. I think they're cool but I think I won't really care if they don't appear in the next game.Now the online... It was♥♥♥♥♥♥ Did anyone else have controller delay 24/7, I know I did. O my god I don't know if the console version's online was bad too but honestly this was crap they didn't fix the netkode at all. Other than that theres king of the Hill player vs player and 5v5 team matches that were kind of cool. The faction wars was stupid the most popular faction wins and you can't contribute that much to your faction so the faction with the most people wins. The towers, I feel like they didn't have time to make towers so they resorted to this. The old tower was unique and only some of the challenges felt like test your luck matches. In this one all of them feel like test your luck challenges. The kick is that player without the dlc will get to demo them as they appear playable in certain tower but I didn't care about this.I liked the Krypt alot althought there is one button mashing segment that I can't get pass through. Its like a game within a game. I knda miss babalites and fatalites but they bring brutalites. Remember those things you have to do in the game (in match) to get a reward rather then paying for it. Well netherealms has clearly forgotten because this game has so many dumb microtransactions. Well not so many but I still don't like it I mean come on EASY FATALITIES! Fatalites are pretty easy and if you can't do one ot too lazy to get your♥♥♥♥♥in the fatality practice room you shouldn't deserve to do one. But chargeing you money to get easy failtalitys WTF. There is also an all items unlocked in Krypt which defeats the purpose of the Krypt. Also, is anyone else bothered that they had 4 DLC characters planned before the launch of the game.Mortal Kombat X is ultimately a fun game and there is lots of fun to be had here. I'd recommend it but for the consoles. If you want it on PC wait for Netherrealm to really fix the PC version up (including controller Delay). They need to fire volatile Studio's♥♥♥♥♥and make the PC port themselves. If they fix the PC port I'll change my opinion but for now I'd avoid it on PC. Only get if you really want to play it and you don't have any other consoles."

Some players also had their saves wiped completely.Do not buy this game until it's fixed!/EDIT-----------Original review-----------At the time of this writing the game has still some serious technical issues, therefore I suggest to wait for these to be fixed.Many people are complaining about optimiziation issues, stuttering and online reliability, though most of the issues at launch seems to be resolved. It seems to me that it's very much hit or miss whether you will encounter these problems or not.But how's the game itself? ...Superb! Mortal Kombat X is MK 9 on steroids.The idea behind the game is to see a new generation of fighters rise, with the classic combatants now older and ready to pass the torch to the new ones. The roster includes 24 characters plus Goro and another four as dlc, each of them come in three different variations that will change the combat apprach.The new characters are decent overall, but not without a few complaints on my part.- D'VORAH and FERRA/TORR are by far the best ones, they're original in both design and gameplay- CASSIE CAGE is the daughter of Sonya Blade and Johnny Cage and of course she's a mix of those two characters, she plays very nicely but it somehow feels redundant to have her AND her parents in the roster (I would've kept Cassie and dropped Sonya and Johnny)- JAQUI BRIGGS is Jax's daughter, again there's a little redundancy here, but at least she plays a little differently than Jax- TAKEDA is Kenshi's son and Scorpion's apprentice, good design and moveset very different from those two, but overall the character is missing some personality of its own- KUNG JIN might be the most uninteresting of the bunch, cousin of Kung Lao but completely different combat style and original design, yet it didn't strike me at all as a suitable MK character- ERRON BLACK, uninspired design and boring moveset, yet it fits in the MK world better than Kung Jin or Takeda- KOTAL KAHN is a little difficult to use but very satisfying to masterIt's great to see MK departing from the usual roster made up by different color shades of ninjas, but I can't help but think that I'd be happier without some of the uninteresting new characters in favour of some of the older ones, like Rain, Sindel, Smoke, Nightwolf, Fujin, Borai Cho and Baraka that only make an appearance in Story mode but you cannot actually play (unless you use mods or if they will ever be added officially).Besides these complaints, the game is fantastic. Combat system is precise as ever, tons of play modes for offline and online players alike and many unlockables to collect. Theres so much content in this game that'll make it worth your money."

Ive played ALOT of fighting game, for an example. MK9, MK8,MK7,The two newest street fighter games even gods among us that was a bit disapointing. I like the game just beacuse of its GREAT graphics. I can just sit back and go through every map and i get goose bumps. What dissapoint me though is the story. MK has had great stories and all but this time they where a bit lazy i think. I think it was a bit slow in a way. It took too long to play Cassie Cage. really it did. And when you got to play her it was like four or a three fights that was too easy. They should taken more time on making the characters just a little bit more personal. But what i really liked was all the perspectives. When you played as The Special Forces you had to fight agains D´Vorah and i kind thaught yeah shes a bad dude. But then when i got to play as Kotal Khan and D´Vorah i kind of looked up to them. All Kotal Khan and D´Vorah wanted in the ""beggining"" was to end the rebellion by making Kotal Khan the emperor. That didnt work out so well. But you get what i mean. Noones bad and Noones is good eaither. Its very politcal in a way. Evryone has there reasons ( There is a guy thats truly the bad guy just noone notices that ""Shinnok""). That was my early  review probably the worst review ive ritten sry :3."

,Recommended,307780,16043983,"Posted: 28 May, 2015",all,Lord Mord,I am going to try to make this sweet and quick. The game in its current state I would recommend to anyone. When it first started I heard it would not even start I had some performance issues mainly with Sub Zero's Level and a little lag but all cleared up. This  is exactly what I wanted as a MK game. Mainly it being two things an Arcade style MK like the originals with today's current graphics. Well it easily meets that I have some gripes but this mainly focuses on saying lack of characters I would like to see every single MK character added to the picture but I understand drawing them and such is not as easy with today's graphics. Currently I run a Mid range Pc but its pretty OC'ed to 42 one day I will see if I can get it to 4.5 but really its enough.. Twin Frozr R9280 1160.. 32gb ram.. The game runs fine but every once in a blue moon the game hiccups think is more programing but its not an issue. But some performance patches would help that..The storyline is in line with Mortal Kombat but most people know they don't buy this game for just its story line it's an arcade fighter and its sublime with its graphics... I rate this game 9.1 But I have some suggestions to both players and the Devs... If you get this game I have one thing to suggest to you & that's get yourself a xbox or PS4 designed controller their our thousands out their but I say xbox/ps because of the keys and feel... Anyways I think his game could be epic but their needs to have allot more unlockable characters and Idk about the storyline hell you threw Jason in the game bring back all the robots and all the others and let us just kil!!! :) really you will love the game it had a bad launch but I never had a problem I come with allot of back ground time in playing this game just want Nightwolf and others back in it with the new graphics :) and make it quick please!Take care and have fun!

I got burned for buying this version of the game and I'm still feeling the effects with the way the DLC comes out for this when the game doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing work.However, since I played the XBOne version of the game, it is safe to say that after playing MK9, the best Mortal Kombat since UMK3 for the PS1, I would have to say I adore this game to it's core (besides the Micro-transactions and the Pay-to-cheat DLC). The story is great, the gameplay feels tight and familiar even with the variation options for each character and the graphics are clean and greatly detailed. (You can even see sweat on Mileena).Do I recommend this game? Absolutely. Just not this godawful port.PS. Take a note from DOA5:LR, Netherrealm. They at least tried to compensate for the lack of online. Try compensating your PC Customers for something besides updates with 'Klassic skins' and as nice looking as they are, two skins don't fix a game like that."

I'm running it with an AMD 8350, GeForce 970 and 16GB RAM and I'll admit I 'occasionally' get some frame rate drops, but nothing game changing.My major gripe is a distinct lack of major characters that cannot be explained with ""It's set in the future"" because Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade are still there, as is Liu Kang and Kano, all from the very first game and all human.But, there's no Barraka, no Smoke, Sector and a whole host of others.  With a character pack of 4+Goro coming in at £25, I get the feeling that to fully own every character it's going to cost several hundred quid, which is utter bs when the past 2 games did it well enough in one release."

No excesses.Review of Day 3 - 8/10The game is a lot better now as now we actually have content. In saying that though I have my issues with the amount of content in this game compared to the last game (MK9).Gameplay - Much faster paced and some really nice looking combos and x-rays. The gameplay feels more streamline that MK9 which had its issues with spamming attacks such as Kabel and Cyrax. Brutalities are back and look great when you can actually get them out (some of the requirements are annoying to complete like Jax's first brutality).The stages are great to look at with a lot going on in the background as well as how you can interact with the stage. You can throw an object at your enemy like an old lady or a monk. Or you can use a wall to get some distance away from your enemy. Though really annoyed at the lack of Stage Fatalities... Looking at these stages i could easily image some of the stage fatalaties that could of happened.Graphics - Huge improvement over MK9 (which I still thing looks great today). There are a lot of graphical issues that hopefully get addressed in the future but I guess we will have to wait and see what they do. Most likely Ed Boon will focus on the DLC and no doubt there will be more. Some of the more iconic characters from MK9 are in MKX that you play against in the story but no option to play against them yet... Baraka and Sindel. Other characters make an appearence in cutscences like Frost and the drunken Master as well as the god of wind. Most likely there will be a second Kombat Pack in the works after the first is released.Story and Extras - The story mode is back and its great but I have my issues with it. To avoid spoilers, its a little on the short side and when things start to get good, its almost over. From memory there is about 12 chapters with 4 fights each and whereas the old game has 16 chapters. It feels a bit rushed and some storyline elements are ignored near the end. Maybe more Story DLC is in the works as well.As for extras, the best addition is the new Krypt setup though the spider caves are annoying as hell as I find the spider jumpscare happens too often compared to the wolf or skinless men. The map has a lot to offer and feels like a small dungeon crawler in that you need items to open the way up for more paths. The one thing that annoys me is that I wish each map would state how many treasures I have missed in each area.I do miss the 300 Tower Challenge from MK9 though. It had different game types in that tower which was interesting. The new tower challenges do have different multipliers but its always the same. Just keep punching or kicking to win. I miss the challengers where you had the hit the enemy in the hit 5 times and 10 times in the leg to win or the zombie waves where you had to pull off 5 energy blasts in a row and swap out to the second character and do their range attack to win. Something different...DLC - So far, there is a lot of DLC for this game. Easy Fatalites and Skip Fight Koins can be brought on the PS4 and Xbox One and thank god not steam. Goro Day 1 DLC and Kombat Pack can be brought but its not out yet besides Goro. I can honestly see more DLC in the future.To summarize. The game is great but it does feel as though some of content from MK9 is lacking... Its worth buying and hopefully soon the graphical issues will be fixed...P.S. Where the ♥♥♥♥ is tag team?"

Story could have been longer (which is the only real negative attribute), and the online netcode needs work (but not holding it against them since it is the first day). Overall I would rate the game a 9/10. TLDR: Good game, like to bash heads, and only bad is the launch."

It's fun and greatly enjoyable with friends when it doesn't break.  I've had it since launch and I screwed the pony on a lot of whacky bugs.  The game didn't work at all when I got it and not because of graphics or drivers, the game would just literally stop working at parts.  I was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥but I kept playing what I could.  As the game patches came out it has become more stable but it's still a bad port.  the game NEVER starts at my native 1080p resolution, always in 1024x 768.  This wouldn't be a problem if it also would fullscreen at that resolution, but instead I get half a screen then a crash of the game.  I need to change my resolution down, put it in windowed mode then change the in game resolution back up just to play....when I bring friends over I tell them how much of a garbage port this is for a wonderful game.  During the game, I get frequent crashes at the end of matches, specfically when pausing to look up a fatality.  When it says ""Finish him!"" it usually breaks something then all my fun playtime goodies are lost.  The game basically needs to be built for pc like it probably was built for consoles, just remember devs, pc gamers are vicious when we don't get what we believe to deserve.  This game though, could have been better for PC.  If you can deal with tweaking dumb little things then you can acutally get a few hours of gameplay in there with no issues but be prepared for a sudden crash if the wind blows the wrong way.  Also, the store seems a bit misleading in game.  I don't know if the extra characters that they are boasting to be available are on the consoles and they didn't change anything but Tremor and Predator are NOT available yet...that I've seen.I bought the game Full price, then after all the bugs and crashes I bought all of the DLC packages and some extra constume stuff I really enjoy the game but seriously don't buy it.  Wait for a price drop or a sale, hell even 15% would make it worth the cost but not 60 bucks plus x for season pass.  The game itself on PC for me is only worth like $45 + tax."

We're all human beings after all and sometimes manmade stuff gets the hiccups, especially when you're delivering something to thousands of people through electric cables. Then came the moment when the downloads began to work and people got into the game. After patiently letting the game download itself in peace and getting my hopes up for a good night of gaming, I realized that I had been rustled once again. A bad launch and connection issues are to be expected. A game with over half of its content locked away is not. Here's a list of things why I do not recommend buying this game, at least not for a month:- Story, Towers, Test Your Might, random characters locked away with no way of unlocking them yet- WAY overblown system requirements. This game has two characters with a relatively static background and it still has higher minimum settings than games like GTA5 or Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes. It's ridiculous.- Graphics settings are minimal and very lacking.- Lots of people, including me, are suffering from horrible performance. Both low FPS and weird stuttering is plaguing the game.So for now DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. SAVE YOUR MONEY. WAIT UNTIL IT'S FIXED.It's a very promising game and looks hella sick on consoles. Some day it will be just as rad and sweet on PC. Just not yet."

The one complaint about this game I have is that the story mode is a bit short and leaves me with a few burning unanswered questions but if you don't care about the plot at all (who should? it's a fighting game I'm just a nerd) than there is literally nothing to love about this Mortal Kombat.

For those of you who did and will download the whole thing before calling it a waste of money and ♥♥♥♥♥ing about every little thing that they never got to experience because they're mentally challenged, congratulations! Welcome to the beautiful world of MKX, full of everything that's good in the fighting game genre. I can't say I got too far in the story, as I was downloading it for most of the night and then had to stop shortly after I started due to work in the morning, but what I did play was phenomenal. The fighting in the single fight games I played were fantastic, the fatalities even more brutal than the last game, the combos and specials were fun and easy enough to use, and looked beautiful (Much like the rest of the game, I might add). The Krypt was also a very pleasant surprise. Where as before, it was just a scrolling area to unlock concept art and costumes and such with Koins, now it's a grid based mini-adventure game with statues and other things littered around to purchase costumes and concept art and brutalities and such. It still has the functionality of the old Krypt, with the added bonus of being a little mini-game in and of itself. I spent a good portion of my download time here just playing around and unlocking stuff (Seeing as you get a ton of koins for just doing things there, I managed to buy a good chunk of the unlockables, despite entering the krypt with only 1500 somethign koins). The new characters in the game are also incredibly interesting, and fantastically designed. This game is quite possibly one of the best games I've played in the fighting game genre to date, and it's going to take quite a bit to top it.Overall, do I recommend this game? Yes, if you like fighting games. I'd even recommend this to those that don't like fighting games, just because of how good the final product is. I feel bad for those who refunded the game, as they're missing out. But hey, maybe the whole slow download process was Nether Realms way of weeding out the idiots from the community. I can only hope they don't come back."

I thought, ""Well, that seems really small for a AAA game."" Then I noticed the post in the game news about the Stream Install and the grim feeling was exacerbated. Deep in my gut, I could feel the sowings of a long, and disappointing night. But then I thought, ""Hey, maybe this won't go terribly."" 7 hours later, I was punished for my optimism. The Stream Installation is a spectacular failure. Upon booting up the game, it does not queue up the other 30 or so installation packs to download, and the game crashes whenever I select one of the few playable features in the initial pre-install. But hey, at least I can look at my in-game statistics. It's nice seeing all those zeroes! And what would I do if I couldn't open the dlc menu? Boy, I'm glad the market place in the game works when everything else doesn't!Edit: After about 5 hours of waiting this morning, I was able to download all 29 Mortal Kombat X Install Packs! And with those packs, comes some good and bad news. The good news: I was finally able to play the bits that the original 3 gigs were supposed to allow me to play, i.e. the training mode, single fights, local multiplayer. The bad news is, the rest of the content is still locked! I cannot access the story mode, the online, the Krypt, or anything else. Even three of the characters in the modes that work are still locked. Whether I have to play the game to unlock them, or if it is still some issue with the game itself, I have no idea. Still not recommending this game, but at least it seems to be on its way to becoming functional.Edit 2: After finally getting all of the features to work, I can say that Mortal Kombat X is actually a very good fighting game. The combat is very fluid and fast paced, and with each character possessing three different fighting styles, it makes for a varied experience from fight to fight. The story is about what you would expect from a fighting game, about 4 hours of the good guys wailing on the bad guys (and the good guys) and vice versa. However, I felt that the story mode this time around was quite a bit easier than the Mortal Kombat that came before it, but that could be good or bad depending on how you like it. There were some minor issues with screen tearing and  audio not syncing up in the very begining of cut scenes, but it would correct itself pretty quickly.Long story short, I would reccomend this game if you like fighters, but be ready for a hassle when installing the game. The Stream Install is incredibly stupid, and very finicky."

There are lots of characters, they all kill each other, but not really... it's everything you'd want from Mortal Kombat. However, I am going to leave this review negative since the game runs very poorly (sometimes dropping over half the frames in a second span) on my system, which, until now, has seemed capable of delivering modern titles at a smooth 60fps. Yes, this is a good game in general, but you should be aware that the poor optimization means that you may have to reduce the graphical quality down a fair bit before it's actually playable.

But, if you have a console then I reccomend you pick it up for whichever console you have due to the annoying, but not deal breaking amount of bugs and glitches. That being said any amount of bugs and/or glitches is absolutly unnacceptable for a AAA title that has perfectly functioning console siblings. I'm holding out faith that these issues will be adressed because the console versions work fine, but as of today the PC version is a disgrace to good ports.Update: The game has now been cut off from updates, and DLC. WB has essentially abandoned this game and for good reason, it is still bug ridden and laggy. Unacceptable, I will no longer support WB for at least another generation of games.

But I have downloaded 10 out of 21 files and I still can't get into a fight cause the file containing the ""arena files"" are not downloaded yet. So after choosing the ones I'm taking to fight the game crashes anyway.This is a good idea but I think not for this kind of games. Steam should think 100 times before do such a thing.

The fighting feels smooth and there's so much choice with the fighters it will take you months to get bored. With the story mode (around 4 hours), Krypt and towers there's plenty to do and all of it is worth a look.Online sadly is the same as it's always been, Hit and Miss. Sometimes you get super laggy matches and other times it's really smooth. It feels like a lottery as the ping indicators give you no idea of the connection. It's a shame as there is so much to do here. If the online worked it would be amazing.Now the problem with this game is not game itself but the terrible port by High Voltage. There are so many bugs, Fps drops and crashes that the game is a chore to play. I have a pretty decent system: R9-290 Xapor X, I7 4770K OC @ 4.4ghz and 16gb ram. This should easily be able to handle this game on ultra but even on the lowest settings I get frame drops and memory error crashes every time I play. Trust me, I have tried every fix I have read about and a few of my own but to no avail. When I have tried to contact someone about these bugs, Warner just don't reply and High Voltage say they were a 'WORK TO HIRE' company and can't help. So the company that ported the game (and it is a console port) can't and won't help as they were no more than hired guns to rush a pc port in whatever state. This is really bad as this probably means that game will never be fixed on the pc. I'm sure stuff like online and a few animation bugs will be fixed by Netherrealm but that's because they apply to console and PC.It seems we just have to get use to a world where AAA games on PC are rushed out and then left in the terrible state they were released in. It's frustrating as I really like the game but cannot recommend this to anyone in it's current state.BUY AT YOU OWN RISK"

Now we should double purchase this to get it on console.Seriously this is a cheap move... no rights no protection whatsoever. I hope that STEAM takes action against this game. Or you know what, at least release us from MKx and give us back our money.If I am not mistaken, Batman also from Warner and also messed up.___________________________________________________________________________________MKX is a great game, but it could have been the ultimate fighting game!, They should have expanded on MK9...While I understand that MKX progresses in the story mode, however let's not foul ourselves, we are here for the fighting experience. while many characters & all the old stages are not avilable in story mode, however why take them from the figthing towers and the selection screen for other modes of play?What is done right:- Stage interactions, limited and done right (unlike injustice mess).- Added Brutalities- 3 Variations per character- More violence, more gore- Living towersWhere did they go wrong with this:- Missing players! Why remove players that were included in MK9? Noob, Smoke, Rain, Freddy, Cyrax, Sector, Kabal, Shiva, Stricker, Jade, Cyber Sub, Nightwold, Sindel.... and more)- No tag team!- DLCs!! even on day one!- No Stage Fatalities- No Babalities- Iconic stages gone (all MK9 stages are gone!)- They have changes classic move commands, e.g. Scorpion Spear now is Back-Forward instead of a quick Back Back...- replaced the iconic health bars with new white lines...- In MK9 there were stages inthe story were you had to fight more than one oponent, this is no longer the case here...PC Port Issues gone wrong:- X-Rays and fatalities are running @ 30 FPS, when you are playing a match at 60hz this annoys.- Technically the game is not optimizaed, just check the forums...- Messed up instalation, done in packages, the game sometimes re-installs it-self (30gb+)- Poor online mode, latency loading for characters is week...Design:- Graphics are imporved in MKX, Unreal Engine is written all over the game now (characters feel like plastic figures).. Why not use realistic skin photo texture to try to replicate the feel of photorealistic graphics? now that would have been impressive.Ideas that could have made the game better:- add ""Create your fighter"" section,- Home Tournament (local pvp)- Tag Team- PVP elimination tournament.- an option to merge MK9 & MK XDo I recommend this? yes it's a good game however only if you have a desktop GTX970 or better... tried this on laptop and can't play beoyd 1024x768 on ultra low!"

When I heard that they were begining supporting the PC version again, I decided it was time to try it out. I am incredibly happy with it. It is incredibly good looking, and plays very well. The only issue I have noticed is a small stutter when changing from cutscenes to combat. I love all of the characters I have encountered so far, and the system of choosing one of 3 different varients of each character really increases the variety that you can experiance. The story seems pretty dumb, but that is kind of no different than any other Mortal Kombat. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy it, but it really is just a series of kind of strange cutscenes to connect the battles together.EDIT: I still really enjoy the game, but I have now finished the incredibly short campaign. I was expecting it to be about the same length as Mortal Kombat 9, but it really is incredibly short, which was slightly disappointing, expecially since there were many characters that I never really got to play as very much, unlike Mortal Kombat 9 where you almost played as every character. In addition, I felt teased when they showed Nightwolf and Noob Saibot in the campaing, but I could never actually play as them."

The MK X is a very balanced, interesting  and detailed game, that revitalizes the story of the fallen elder god Shinnok, previously described in MK 4. Though the main idea of the plot hasn't been changed, we see some new details about this new interpretation, like the fact, that the honor of dealing with this false ruler is being passed to the new generation, a concept which is criticized by some people as a ""shady attempt to renew the characters list"".What do we have in the end, putting aside all the prejudices and looking at the real pros and cons?+ Beautiful graphics.Like, for real. Warner Bros and Nethterrealm studios have proven their graphic potence in the MK Komplete Edition, but here, they jumped far over their own heads - they made cinematics, background and character textures as real as they could get.+ Lots of humor.I know that the gameplay and the plotline should be interesting, but it's cool to sometimes have some fun stuff to relax. And here, we can observe plenty of it - some characters, like the Cage family are filled with sarcasm and fun, so their behaviour looks more realistic. The way Cassie curses makes me smile, really.+ Fighting system: using surroundings.That, for sure, is a HUGE and very cool addition to the fighting system. And certainly it adds more fun to it, especially if you through a granny toward your opponent on a marketplace. :-)+ The new Krypt is fenomenal!Seriosly, it's size, the number of achievements you can discover there, the fact, that you should find special elements to break through some areas (which to me is a cool mini-quest) and the creatures, randomly appearing, which I absolutely adored; in other words - it only got way better!But don't get me wrong - though I absolutely recommend playing this game, I am not going to be a vanilla-like on its disadvantages, because there are some serious (in my humble opinion) gaps, that the developers didn't manage to fill.- The plotline. Particularly, the end of the story.Allthough, I like the reincarnation of it as a whole, and it was good to see some new faces, there are a few big questions to the storymakers: do you really suppose that 18 y.o. girl is capable of knocking out the super-evil-former-elder-god-now-butt-kicking-demonic-Shinnok with all his superpowers, even if that girl is a straight descendant of famous Johnny Cage and Sony Blade? That was a HUGE dissapointment to me (especially the fact, the someone as powerful and capable as Shinnok got knocked out so easily by some gal, which is ridiculous). I know that this way the developers gave path to a new generation, but...well, to me, it just occured too quickly, without any preconditions to it.- Short story mode. And easy story mode.And let's be honest here - that comes none close to the Komplete Edition, which had longer story mode, and was obviously harder to complete. This also dissapointed me a lot, because it literally took me 3-4 hours to complete the story mode, with all the cinematics. In Komplete Edition, it took me several days to do that.Conclusion:Well, all in all, it was worth playing it, and I will certainly have more fun plaing it with my friends in versus mode, but due to the couple of big disadvantages, I give this game 8 out of 10. In other words, good enough, but still there's room for improvement."
