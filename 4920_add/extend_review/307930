The upside to the DLC is the missions, the missions were actually fun ecspecially the one where you had to rescue the dinosaurs from the military. All in all this is a great expansion pack for an awesome game (even though there isn't alot to it)."

I can still remeber playing Wild Life Park 2 when I was younger and I always wanted the Dino World expansion but I could reallly never get it. Thank you steam for putting this game up."

(I dont mean hacking or glitching dont do that XD)

Keep needing to restart the game and try to find a different route - it's very frustrating for what should be a fun casual game. I'm really disappointed that I spent my money on this."

I was standing right next to ""Sparrow"" for the first quest, and it was still asking me to find her -- I also kept getting graphical glitches where a ""rider"" NPC would flash over the screen for a fraction of a second and be gone. Would not reccomend this game, it is nothing like the original Wildlife Park, which has more of a roller coaster tycoon sort of feel."

I also noticed that I was getting a ton of pop ups when I went on the internet. I uninstalled the game because it was so bad I couldn't even use my internet. Uninstalled it and all the pop ups went away!
,Not Recommended,307930,11328681,"Posted: 19 July, 2014",all,Titanus the Dragon,"the first mission is broken, you can't even start the first step of the first mission to progress. that and many models, maps, and textures where Never completed. this is basicly your Zoo Tycoon Clone that is trying to hook you in with Dinosaurs. the only good thing it has is the freeplay or Sandbox mod. but even that shares some glitches and issues.If you want a park builder simulator game, get Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis for XBOX, PC, and PS2. it's way better then this, and it was made back in 2002!Wildlife Park 2 - Dino World, Just pass it"

It gets kinda boring after a while. It starts to feel repetitive, and eventually you just get bored with it. If your a building person, go for it, go nuts, but this isn't something that holds my interest for an extended period of time. Usually I play for an hour at a time at most before quitting."
