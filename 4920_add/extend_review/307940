,Recommended,307940,28092569,"Posted: 29 November, 2016",all,Snoopa,"Well, this game is a diamond in the rough. As a huge fan of survival games, you just can't beat something like this. Especially at it's price point. It is a freaking steal.I went into the game with very low expectations. Survival games have been becoming very cliched. This game, also, is your typical survival, but what makes this different is there's an end game. What's the reward when you complete the game? Multiplayer! That is pretty cool for its genre.The game does have a story. Very small so far that I have seen. You come in on a ship and happened upon an island where experiments were or is being ran. The mission is to make it to the center and turn off teslas so your life can go back to normal. But you must survive, grind, and craft so you can prepare for the threats that lie towards the center. Wolves, bears, zombies, and others I'm sure. When they hit you, it hurts. I had to run back to camp after every melee fight so far. I've learned to fight from a distance. The threats in the game are very much real and resources seem to be very hard to come by. But that brings me to another of why I enjoy this game. To proceed, you must hunt down these creatures that want to kill you. You may need the bear fur or bones, wolf's pelt, zombie may have a weapon. You do what you must to proceed.Now the cons.-There are a few bugs. But they are more nitpicky bugs to me. Nothing to where it is game ruining.-Time in the day. It's hard to tell how much time you have until it gets dark. From the story in the game, it's dangerous when night falls and I've never been stuck out there to find out how dangerous it is. But when night comes, you have about 20 secs from the moment you realize its dusk til it is completely dark. But it was mention in-game that the island is messing with the day and night cycle so it could be part of the game.-The map. There's two different maps. One full view of the island then one map that is more zoomed in. I can't move the map in any direction to see when way I need to go. Sense of direction is all messed up for me because the sun seems to be running North and South according to the map.  There's no compass, So i tend to get turned around here and there and have to open my map every 10 seconds. I know I could run straight but the island is full of mountain terrain and threats of the creatures always stop me.-Melee. It's impossible to melee attack and not get hit back. In other words, no way of dodging theirs. When they hit you, it hurts.From those cons, they are more nitpicky cons than actual cons. I could actually say, I haven't experienced one bad moment.Pros-Price point. 3 dollars and you get an amazing game. This game is worth more and I appreciate the devs for making it this low to try to get attention.-Survival aspect. This is par with all the good survival games out there right now. Only difference is it being single player. But I love that.-The unknown. I can't help but just have the sense of not knowing what is just over that hill. For once, I am happy to fear the things in the woods than to fear a random player killing me for my stuff.-Last note, price point."

I'm like ""Oh dear how bad is this going to be"" but still watch the videos for it and think actually that doesn't look too bad. So I take a punt and am playing it in 30 minutes, my review....I've been playing alot of 7 Days To Die recently hence the recommendation for a similar genre game, Radiation Island is the best value for money on Steam atm in my humble opinion. It reminded me abit of ark (no dinosaurs) in looks, the crafting is so easy to get to grips with its almost idiot proof. It looks alright, zombies are abit Plants N Zombies but thats ok, the others certainly make up for it. Theres animals to go kill and harvest for their skins and meat, plenty of material grinding to be had, base building nice and simple, no messing. Its even got the Minecraft option to sleep at night so you don't get chewed up by the wild creatures that are bolder and nastier during dark hours.Seriously folks, if you've got £1.99 to spare and like your survival games get this you will not regret it.Co-op coming in the future apparently and active devs in the community, good to see."

,Recommended,307940,28561714,"Posted: 23 December, 2016",all,BaoDown,"The main selling point of the game is its price. The graphics are terrible, there are some bugs (doesn't affect gameplay), and the pathing of the hostiles are pretty crappy (zombies move in twitches is the main one). But for 3 bucks all these flaws are neglible.  The game offered me a good 9 hours of gameplay and then the rest was pretty repetitive. The beginning when you're exploring and getting a hang of the game is the best part. Towards the middle when you have armor and find a gun, it's fun to explore dangerous territory and actually make progress in the story. The ending of the game is awfully boring though.The best equipment will be found in the middle game and in abundance, which makes the game pretty unbalanced in the end. I can't remember how many times I died in the first half of the game, and then all of a sudden I never died again. The ending was also a big disappointment. A big disappointment... But again, it's only 3 dollars for 9 hours of fun which is a pretty good ratio for a surivial game. I don't regret buying the game at all, I only wish they'd work on the ending a lot more."

As soon as I saw this game I knew it would be good and this game packed over 9 hours. Since this take place in WW2 I loved it since I am an absolute history buff and it was cheap. Although enough praising I do wish this game had more activity by the developers but overall 9/10.

There is a lot to do here - base(s) building, resources gathering, island exploring, treasure finding, hunting, crafting. Enough for many and many hours of play, and when you get bored, you just progress through the main story and finish the game. If you focus on main objectives you can finish the game quite quickly, several hours I'd say (provided you have stocked up decent amount of ammo before). Downsides... The exploration aspect is quite fascinating at the beginning but after you aquire the best guns and craft enough ammo it stops being that interesing. Again, once I ran out of things to do, I just went through the story and finished the game. All in all - very nice game, especially considering the price. I'm glad I stumbled in it. Recommended for those who are interested in survival/crafting games and are not very demanding in terms of graphics (I like nice looking games, and this one is Ok in my book, nothing fancy but decent enough). Apparently it has multiplayer, but I didn't try it, and singleplayer was quite satisfying for me. P.S. Oh and it has 3rd person view, I found out it within couple of minutes before the end :), accidently pushed ""O"" button."

I've been playing the Mac version for a couple of years now and this looks to be a nice port.The game was originally designed for iOS, but it turns out to be one of those rare gems that makes mobile gaming look good. There's no DLC, no micro-transactions, none of that nonesense which gives contemporary gaming a foul taste in the mouth.For 3 bucks, you are getting a surpringsly deep and feature complete survival game.  (Thumbs up to Atypical Games for keeping the same price!)Here's the game - You find yourself on an island, now survive. This means:* You must disable towers on all the islands* Fight the irradiated inhabitents and the psychotic animals* Yes, there are zombies* Nightime can be very painful* You must explore ancient WWII ruinsThe game has crafting and base building as well as a story that actually ends vs playing it until you get bored.The game also has multiplayer but you have to beat the game in order to play it. It's just a simple deathmatch game which isn't that intriguing.If you are interested in seeing it in action, I made an entire Let's Play series on it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62EFxiz3aJE&t=7s"

Most of the time you're going to be crafting weapons, armor, and ammo. The rest of the time you're killing zombies. This is a cool game.With that being said, there is room for improvement. The controller controls suck, but you do have the option of customizing them. The game is tedious when you're starting out. It takes forever to get a foot hold in the game, but once you do the game is easy. I'm sure the developers will make improvements here and there. (They just added steam trading cards today.)Here's a few tips: Early on, stay on the beach and search the buildings for supplies. Make leather armor for yourself ASAP. You'll have to fight a few zombies before you get the good supplies. (Once you get the industrial pickaxe, or titanium pickaxe, go mine more titanium that way you'll be able to keep mining and build your ammo reserves.) Have fun."

,Recommended,307940,30502295,Posted: 13 March,all,GilmooDaddy,"Radiation Island is a true gem. For $3, you get a ridiculous amount of content: A full fledged open world survial crafting game with a loose story to tie it all in. It isn't as complicated or deep as a game like 7 Days to Die or The Forest, but this is what make it truly remarkable.The game is light on crafting, giving you all the options from the start, with most of your more powerful weapons being found in marked treasure chests on the map. There are base building options for the hardcore, but most will find it easier to fast travel to a home base as soon as night hits.The visuals aren't anything extraordinary, but Radiation Island makes up for it with a very daunting and creepy atmosphere. Day/Night cycles and constantly varying weather patterns keep things fresh, while random radiation clouds spring up at random to give the island a feeling of ""science and technology gone wrong."" Great sound effects compliment it all very well, more so when you play with a decent headset, and keep things spooky.It's hard to recommend Radiation Island because I find it hard to explain why I enjoy it so much myself. Keep your expectations low and realize this isn't aiming to be next gen by any means. It's great for what it's worth, and I can honestly say I've played similar yet terrible titles at 10 times the price."

If you think you're safe walking around during the day, think again. You may just come across a floating black mass that drains you of your radiation suit, chest armour, pants, boots and helmet and then your eventual death. My advice - when you see this black mass......RUN the other way amd keep running because there's next to no chance you can outrun it if you're too close.The music is appropriate for the situation you're in. When there's danger, music intensifies, when it's peaceful around you, the music is mellow. One of the nest attributes of this game is the weather pattens. It changes a lot from clear skies to rain to fog and adds to the gameplay nicely.The crafting system is simple and there's an ubudance of resources all over the island and you won't starve to death travelling on foot,I really hope the devs add more content to this game because it's a diamond in the rough and up there with the more expensive crafting games."

I own this on IOS, the mouse and keyboard work so much better here. It's a good survival game, with an actual story and there is a end, you can actually beat the game. As a matter of fact, you have to beat the game once on single player to unlock multiplayer. But it's still a survival game with bases and crafting and such. It you like survival games, I'd definately recommend this one. Especially at only $3. They are charging the same price as it is in the mobile stores, so kudos on them for that. The only way you can even tell that this is a mobile game is the menus are a little wonky, and there is no main menu, the game just starts but you get used to it. Key bindings seem to work well also."

I loved it on iOS, I'm sure it will be even better for PC. I will update this review when I put more gameplay time into it.After playing:So I beat the game and got all of the achievements. The game was great for the price. It only crashed three times in the amount of time it took me to play through the story (seven hours). The third crash set me back a bit (I was working on getting to the last tesla tower).I do not see much replay value, however, there is likely some fun to be had in continuing playing the open-world portion of the game. There is a multiplayer option with a scarce amount of people who actively play it. If there is anyone on, there is a high chance that they are a hacker. It is also kind of repetitive walking constantly to the radiation towers, it is probably something that takes up a quarter of play time.Positives:There is a cool base-building system that I used, but not much. It can probably introduce a lot of a playtime as it is fun to build and you can do a good amount with it. I may come back to this game just to use it more. It is similar to Rust's base-building.Graphics are incredible for a game that costs 2.99.I can run this game with >200 FPS on maxed out graphical settings.The game supports 144hz, you have to go into the configuration file yourself and set the VSync value to zero, however.Massive amount of content for it’s price.Cool animations, the “old rifle” (the bolt action rifle) has a nice satisfying reload animation.Interesting storyline, based off of a real life conspiracy theory (Philadelphia Experiment)Negatives:Looting is generally bland.Game seems to have been abandoned by the developers.In my seven hours of gameplay, I've had three crashes occur.The multiplayer is bland and I do not think there is a way to communicate with other players but it is better than getting nothing.Other things that should be mentioned:Not much variety of items (not a big deal.)Gameplay is somewhat repetitive (most survival games are like this.)The multiplayer is also potentially unoptimized. In the short while I played it I noticed that people shake around in place. This may not be the games fault as it could be a result of ping."

My computer had an i7, 16gb of ram and a nvidia 970 graphics card and this game is the slowest thing ive seen. i know this game is also on mobile and if my iphone can run this and my computer can then it needs to be fixed with a later update. I bought this game thinking it was going to be like the one on my phone but it runs like crap on my computer. I dont recommend buying this just yet. Wait till they fix alot of the issues as they say there going to be fixing them soon.In the mean time check out the app version on ios and android its amazing."

You can build houses, but as far as I can tell there's no point given that if you stop moving for a split second you die. I'm giving this a thumbs down for now, but I'm going to keep playing it. The developers seem nice and responsive so with some improvement I'll change it to a thumbs up.Here's how I spent 75 minutes.Left ""tutorial area"" and got attacked by 4 wolves.Got chased by a bear.Got chased by 4 mountain lions.Got chased by two wolves that were themselves being chased by a crocodile.Got attacked by 5 mountain lions.Got attacked by tiger.Got chased by zombies.Got chased by a pack of zombies being chased by a bear.Found houses on the water.Felt safe.Checked inside boat house.Boat house had mountain lion inside.Got chased by mountain lion.My advice to the developer:A) Dramatically scale back the number of things that can kill you.B) Add deadly birds and sharks so that I never have to stop being chased.There are multiple difficulty options, and the game should run well on even very old PCs. The price is perfect of not a bit generous so if you're curious it might be worth your time."

When I saw the price point my heart sank as I thought that this was just another one of those asset flip cash grabs. After reading some reviews I decided to give it a shot. I figured I would only be out $3.00.This game completely suprised me. It is a lot more polished than what I expected for an inexpensive early access game. The physics and gameplay are solid. The story is interesting (reminds me of Lost).Get this game. Support this good development behavior. We need more like this on Steam.

For £1.99 I was not expecting much but the video looked interesting and it had many positive reviews so I thought I would give it a go. I'm hooked on it. The simplicity of the interface works for me and I love the lack of starting inventory slots. Makes you plan ahead on what resources you are going to need. Anyway, inventory space can be expanded by ""upgrading"" your backpack.Must be played with headphones. When that claw turns red and the music kicks in it's panic and brown trousers time.Give it a go. For a survival horror it's dirt cheap and fun to play."

If you have never played a survival game but want to see what they are about then this is your game and if you have played alot then this can make a nice wind down game or a fun sunday morning disstraction just make sure you play on survival mode . I can only score this 10/10 the game is good the issues at the moment are just down to my own personal prefernce and its has to be one of the best value games ever made unless you play F2P without ever paying for anything .

How did I miss this at release? smh Love graphics, the movement, the controls. Gorgeous landscapes, unraveling story through discovery. There is a tutorial that is really good and crafting is with the best of them imoParts ive disliked:walking on the water floor is the same as walking on land. Water collide is mehZombies and animals are repetitive and redundant. Tigers, sheep, bears, and rabbits. wtf? I know its a created island but it needs some more.could use a real mix of people you would find on an island like this that are zombies. They dont match the environment as they were short changed by comparison graphically, i.e. 7Days horrible zombiesIm a zombie ♥♥♥♥♥ what can I say.Excellent game for the price. You would be foolish not to get it.BTW the biggest open world game. If you think this is a small map, its because you are looking down while you are sitting there typing."

,Recommended,307940,28924859,Posted: 1 January,all,DovahQuinn,This game is like rust legacy without multiplayer and with a bit of a story. You spawn in with nothing and have to gather and collect resources as in any other survival game and your objective is to disable the many electric towers scattered throughout the map. You collect journal entries around the island to help you with this and its pretty interesting to read through some of the entries you find. Enemies are a bit too easy in  my opinion but the game remains fun and performs well. In about 2 hours of playtime I have created myself a small hovel and disabled one of the many towers. The process of finding and crafting new gear feels satisfying and not too grindy and I hope to get many more hours out of this title. It should also be noted that at the price point I bought it at ($1.99) it was well worth the purchase and I have been told that multiplayer is unlocked once you complete the game (Disable all of the towers on the island).

,Recommended,307940,29580120,Posted: 29 January,all,Slofiend,"This is the first exploration/survival game I've tried, and I picked it up becuase it was only ~$3.  Wow, this may be the best purchase I've made in a while.  Super fun.  It took me a while to figure out how to sort of survivie and what I could craft, but I never felt lost or punished for exploring and the game makes it reallt clear where you can and should go as you're learning.  There is no level system, just better gear you can find/make.  After a little more than 7 hours in, I feel like I am well equipped to suruve and really begin to push out and explore without worrying about running away from things.  I am really enjoying this game.  I would say that the soundtrack, while wonderfully atmospheric only contains about 15 minutes of unique music, so prepare for it to loop, a lot.  Aside from that, this is simple to get into a slighlty more complex as you explore the world.  One note, you can click on the 'compass' looking icons on the map to fast travel, took me forever to fiure that out.  But I would recommend this game for sure.  Real fun and I keep coming back to it."
