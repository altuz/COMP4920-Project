,Not Recommended,307980,11611196,"Posted: 8 August, 2014",all,POON APE,I bought this game back when it first came out in the late 90's.Over 14 years they have left it largely untouched other than the player roster. Oh and they somehow found a way to add more bugs. It would be a good game if they bothered to update it. If you are looking for a cricket Football Manager you will left wanting. It looks and feels cheap and unloved.It was worth 20 dollars 14 years ago. Its worth $5 today.AVOID!!!!!!! Unless you are some type of cricket manager tragic and even then wait for a sale.

It has had fairly minor tweaks over the years as my original tactics used to dominate one dayers dont work anymore and of course 20/20s arent all that old.This game brings back memories...I played the first copy that I had to death and found a spreadsheet on an old usb that had stats for an England Captain game from 2000 to 2026 on it earlier today!  I've also bought a version that had Phil Hughes on the cover that I remember he averaged 65ish opening for Australia (might have been 2009?) as well as the 2011, 13 & 14 versions.  This is the best of the lot with the different game modes and a one-day engine that I haven't figured out yet (I'm only 30 odd hours in).There is a reason I keep spreadsheets with this game - it has 1 big bug....at the end of the season some players may disappear!  It's something that's happened since the first version and with Nathan Lyon magically disappearing and taking his 176 wickets @ 31 as Australia's only spinner with him in 2015 I certainly noticed (particularly as Ryan Harris just retired and I lost 1/2 my bowling attack in 1 off season)....it's a worry when Maxwell is your frontline spinner!It's sheer playability and the constant searching for that next great player helps to get over any quirks in the match engine as pretty much anything can be chalked up to it being cricket (still not sure how I got rolled for 50 in a T20 and then won the world cup only a couple of months later).Just like Football Manager you'll make attachments to players you've never heard of...I see from my original game Matthew Bulbeck played 176 tests scoring 6898 runs at 36.11 and took 754 wickets at 28.65 (I'm sure he wouldn't have minded that sort of career and I've tried with Butterworth and Faulkner in recent years to find a similarly performing left handed allrounder) while I had a regen, G Fuller play 207 tests, score 20155 runs @ 70.97 with a HS of 397 and 75 100s.In this years game I'm only up to 2016/17 with Australia but Chris Lynn 19 tests 1459 runs @  54.04, Ryan Carters 21 tests 1314 runs @ 50.54 and Glenn Maxwell 17 tests 808 runs @ 42.53, 35 wickets @ 35.23 would be pretty happy with their new careers!"

It's been 8 years....This game is a little bit of an upgrade from 2013 as it's got better shot play, more field settings etc but still not what I was really expecting in terms of progress made on the game.For example, Cricket Coach brings out a new game each year with loads of new features after lots of talk with the CC community....Cricket Captain very rarely communicate and take on decent ideas from the community ever.For next years game, they will need to improve massively as now with Steam, the players of 2014 will be wanting more."

A good cricket ""management"" sim, though there's no sacking, jobs offered and a few basic competitions missing. All in all, it's as good as you'll find for a cricket management sim, but lacking in a lot of areas."

So when I learnt that Cricket Captain was coming to Steam naturally I was excited. Playing the game brought back all those nostalgic feelings of my youth but after an hour or so something occured to me and made me realize just why I had that feelingIt's the same f***ing game.Don't get me wrong, I don't mean that as like ""oh it's nostalgic and a great throwback"" I mean the same game as in nothing's changing, sure the graphics have SLIGHTLY improved and there are a few new quirks like Hawkeye but it's the same animations, the same featureless blobs in what should be players and the same looking screeens between bits of footage.Not only that, the AI has somehow gotten WORSE in this iteration. For all the illusion of control you have your batsmen have all of two states of play, ""Two Runs an Over"" or ""Swing at everything like your 5 year old brother in the backyard"". Meanwhile the opposing AI has no trouble whatsoever going merrily at 4, 5, 6 runs an over regardless of what fields and what agression you have set on your bowling.The game engine is a mess, the Australian career mode is a joke and the same animations that were in the game in 1999 are here in 2014.Do NOT buy this game. For the love of god make Childish Things get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together. This game is an abomination on all mankind. If you want a good cricket management game buy Cricket Coach, it has no graphics or commentary to speak of but at least that has an excuse (It's made by a one man development team). There's no excuse for this.♥♥♥♥ this game. ♥♥♥♥ the developers and ♥♥♥♥ you Cricket Captain for making me love you in the first place"

Appart form updated player rosters and one or two more differnt options when it comes to what type of game you want to play, this game is exactlly like all the CC i have ever see. No new animations, no new commentry, the commentator is still an idiot and the the creators still do not understand the LBW rule.Over all not a bad game, but if you want something new you will be disapointed."

However, the new User Interface (UI) of the present edition is the worst I have played on. The UI is not intuitive at all. All the buttons have been put at the worst of places. Viewing information about a player has become a big task. The UI disappoints me beyond anger or grief. Putting on fancy pants does not assure you a win in the beauty contest.  Plus, the obivious criticism of the lack of game play still remains. A big let down!"
