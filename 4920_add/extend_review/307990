Wildlife Park 2 Fantasy is a small EP that is worth the $1 price (if your a fan of this game). this pack contains two types of animals, dragons and unicorns. This is where the pack becomes a little bit disapointing where there is simply a lack of other fantastical creatures such as; ogres, trolls, imps and other creatures based around mythology. Overall this pack will please fans of this game and delivers a new idea that is never before seen in zoo simulators."

I really appreciate the quick response from those high up. It means a lot to me and, Im sure the community as well. I would now recommend this game to anyone, this game is a lot of fun and is way better than ZT."

I didn't require a tutorial because I'd played all the other expansions, and I've gotten to tenth generation Fire Dragons so far. I guess I find this more interesting than other users because I've always been more focused on breeding than doing Missions."

This game was the only thing that kept me alive, and they tried to take it away from me.I've been in hiding for the past two years, and they still haven't found me yet.I'm at risk right now but I need to warn youThis game is the best game imaginable, and if you are safe from the government please play this game.Just know that you are at a high risk of being exposed to extremely good media.You have been warned"

NO me neither but you can experience it in WIldlife park 2 fantasy ... a worthy ''standalone'' from the popular wildlife park series. Lots of fun prob if you buy the full game ... =)

Sadly, with only this pack you really cant enjoy the game as a whole and i wasnt even able to figure out how it worked since i had so few creatures to use. Negative review because it should have been more clear about needing some larger product. as for what it would be like with that larger product? i can only guess."

,Not Recommended,307990,35483069,Posted: 4 October,all,Nyrva,"This game sucks. Nothing tells you how to play it, animals starve to death because you can't feed them. Everything is pictures with no mouseover descriptions of what things do. There aren't even any cheats for those of us who are noobs or who suck at this. Unless you're good at picture/icon games with no tutorials avoid this. You can't even get more money. I was playing the ""free play"" version and I'll bet that's half the problem, even though you buy this game it's probably pay-to-win."
