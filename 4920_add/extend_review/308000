,Recommended,308000,11655301,"Posted: 11 August, 2014",all,Drjones013,"This was one of the classic early Sierra adventure games, featuring random deaths, the ever-present threat of mining the wrong claim, and proof of Al Lowe's sacred mantra 'Save Early, Save Often.' If you can get past the parser interface (you'll have to actually type with correct spelling with the approved verbs) this version seems to have fixed some of the timing issues (particularly the 'normal is timestop') in previous DosBox versions. It's fairly historically accurate, it's more than entertaining for a really old game, and for an old Sierra fan like myself, it was an instabuy.The sound does seem to lag the game just a bit, which is odd.9/10"

It’s not like today’s point and click game where you click on a location and the character will move there.  You have to use your arrow keys to direct every step of the movement.  You also have to instruct the character what to do.  Encountering another character will not automatically trigger conversation.  You have to tell your character to ‘talk’ by typing this in.  If you don’t type in the correct series of words, this will also halt your progress.  And last but not least, there is potential to fall into a big hole in this game.  Let’s say you did not pick up a certain something on level one, well if you don’t have it at level 10, you can forget finishing this game …   Still, there is a lot of charm to this game with its graphics and story plot.  I recommend it on sale.  I would also like to play the updated anniversary edition."

Games such as Gold Rush! really put your mind to the test since you actually have no idea what to do once you're in the game. There are no pointers, almost no hints and there are timed events that you are not even aware of!Play this game and have a taste of how games were back in the eighties!"

Save often friends, you may live or you may die, but at least you can retry ;).  Gold Rush had to be one of the most entertaining games I played, I was a history buff and getting to somewhat live it in this game made it a true blast, and that is only part of the fun.  You also had to figure out what to say and how to say it correctly to get items, or get the correct information, or not die from scurvy going around the cape!  Everyone shoudl play this if nothing but for the history of adventure games.  Thank you for reading!"

It's one of the lesser-known Sierra games, and doesn't have a HUGE amount of puzzles or variability to it (despite the ""three routes"" claim).  It might take you just a couple of hours to grind through it all.  But I'd say it's worthwhile, if nothing else, for the underrepresented historical genre..."

I really wish the remake they were working on was a hand drawn remake instead of a 3d one, hopefully one day I'll be able to release my personal remake."

76561198128468087,Recommended,308000,29836922,Posted: 10 February,all,blu2rain,"Classic Sierra Adventure Games;So, that intro from the beginning makes me *sigh* from the inside.  These games (for me) are memories of growing up and sitting on my father's knee and learning about computers...(the next step involved constructing my own PC from scratch, but that's a different story for a different time)Sierra INVENTED the adventure genre as far as I'm concerned, and ""Gold Rush"" is not only an excellent example of a classic adventure game, it is also the benchmark for self-involved concepts as well as being true to life history.What I personally love about this game is remembering my youth (I was 8 when it came out) but what makes it spectacular for its development at the time is that not only is it an emotionally involved storyline (regarding the family story) it also sticks to factual history.  In addition it reminds me of the current housing crisis, in that if you don't sell your house before a certain set time in the game (always save, save, SAVE with these classics!) you lose a large amount of monies and can not proceed in the game as desired!!!*LOL* These games always frustrated me when I was younger due to the fact that you almost EVERY TIME (with Sierra...<3 Sierra <3) had to RESTART a game from scratch if you missed ONE...MINISCULE...ITEM!!But seriously, that's more realistic than ANY game I've seen or played up until now.  When else (In Real Life IRL) have you been able to rewind and make sure you did something in a specific way to ensure that things turned out the way you wanted?  In addition, when we played these games, if we were stuck, we couldn't just hop onto Google and figure out the answer, we had to call a hotline and pay REAL CASH to get a hint book that didn't always guarantee a correct answer, but still left us guessing...damn, love you Google, but seriously, you made life too easy!*Steps off of soap box*If you have a LITERAL dollar to spend, give Sierra adventuring a try.  King's Quest (which I KNOW you've heard of) Space Quest (in my opinion better than King's Quest) Quest For Glory (Best. Game. Series. EVER. end of story)  Leisure Suit Larry (good for all of persons out there as dirty in the mind as I am) and so many, many more!Gold Rush remains a classic to me, please enjoy it with me."
,Recommended,308000,21860900,"Posted: 15 March, 2016",all,codefenix,"This is an oft overlooked classic, and deserves a play.  Designed on Sierra's AGI platform, players familiar with the original King's Quest, Space Quest, and Leisure Suit Larry games from the 80s will feel right at home.  The game offers replayability, as there are three different paths from Brooklyn to Sacramento, each with its own unique challenges and puzzles to overcome.  The designers also painstakingly went to great lengths to include various points of historical detail about The United States as it was being formed, and the sacrifices made and hardships endured by those who risked the journey across... granted, it's a work of pure fiction, but it paints a believable picture, at least believable enough for an 80s adventure game to be immersive.Well worth a play for the price."

Gold Rush was a favorite of mine for many reasons. That being said this game is 100% authentic to the original. The command line typing, getting run over by wagons, falling off ladders, etc. The best thing is that is played flawlessly on my modern pc. If you want the original experience, and its a good one, get this game. If you find command line typing a bit tedious it may not be your cup of tea. I would buy any Sierra game that runs this smoothly and is so true to the original."

The game, however, hasn't aged well at all. The graphics are old but artfully done. It's really easy to die in this old school map, don't be fooled this game still has some spunk, You just use directional keys and type commands such as look or take, so this is a challenge for sure!I'm looking forward to playing the updated version, since this one was just too old and dated to enjoy.Maybe worth $1 for nostalgia sake.Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

So unless you have a fetish for eighties point and click adventures I would avoid. To give you an idea this is so old that it still uses the : Type what you want to do in the box that almost never works interface.It can be gotten for cheap however so give it a try for yourself if you are curious. It certainly failed to draw me in.
,Not Recommended,308000,31780565,Posted: 15 May,all,El Presdente,"You may want pass on Gold Rush for better games of the era if you have a choice. Sierra isn't known for Gold Rush and this adventure is on par with average adventure games of the day: needlessly difficult and unfair with few clues and punishment for trying your own solutions. I won't get into the many problems you'll encounter with this game design, but players will discover many of them within the first 15 minutes of starting the game.Aside from the average game design, the music is beyond minimal and the graphics are in low resolution EGA. To make matters worse, the artist has an unfortunate propensity for very bright color selection, and, as of the version being reviewed, the graphics are poorly rendered by Dosbox 0.74, a 7 year old emulator. This simply does not look good on modern displays and is unacceptable."

,Recommended,308000,34738923,Posted: 4 September,all,Dauntless3788,"TLDR: A true classic adventure game with replay value! If you haven't tried it, you are missing out.I played Gold Rush! years ago when it was on old floppy disks so I was thrilled to find it available for download on Steam. The puzzles are fun and the classic artwork is beautifully detailed and designed for its era. There are some confusing moments when its hard to figure out what to do next, specifically in the very start, but normally the game tells you the situation and as long as you pay attention to the conversations and text you should be able to tell what needs to be done. The music is a truly classic sound. The beeps playing 'Oh! Susanna' in the start hit me right in the nostalgia bone from days of EGA adventure games like Space Quest and Police Quest.One thing this game had over its contemporaries was replayability. Unlike most adventure games which give you a very linear method of completion, this game gives you three different methods to travel to California. You can choose the overland method which gives you a feeling like being on the Oregon Trail, the Panama method which is a jungle adventure, and the Cape Horn method which gives you an adventure on the sea. Each one has different challanges to overcome and each one is well designed and fun.The biggest issue with this game is that it has the one thing that made Sierra games frustrating, NO BACKTRACKING! Basically there are items in the game which are acquired early on which are required near the end. If you forget to grab them or didn't even know you needed that item then you are going to have to restore back to a save point when you could get the item and play through everything all over again.A more minor issue is that you need to type in all your commands. This could be spun as a motivator to learn how to properly spell and type but for some people I could see how they would find it more cumbersome.In finale, a truly nostalgic look at the beginnings of gaming which still holds its own today. This is a definite recommend to all adventure gamers."
