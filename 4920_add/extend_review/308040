76561198189155037,Recommended,308040,19436970,"Posted: 2 December, 2015",all,Susan,"Short and fun. The game makes use of its isometric graphics with its puzzles.Puzzles are fairly simple to solve. Even in nightmare mode, the puzzles don't feel frustrating. Most of the time, you won't be forced to restart puzzles.Story is minimal in this game. The goal is simply to lead Bob to his bed.Graphics look solid, appealing and unique in a way. The perspective sometimes look like they don't make sense, which isn't an issue since it's supposed to be a dream anyway.Music gets repetitive after a while. The most memorable thing for me is Bob's snoring. The voice actor sounds a bit creepy, in my opinion.If you're looking for something quick, fun and slightly different to pass the time with, this game is a good bet.If you're looking for something mind boggling and challenging, it might be better to give this a pass."
,Recommended,308040,19552162,"Posted: 7 December, 2015",all,Lin,"tl;dr: A too short puzzler with a striking visual theme that completely overshadows the conventional and mostly uninspired gameplay. Recommended with caveats.***The most interesting thing about Back To Bed is clearly the art style. The game's aesthetics are firmly rooted in iconic imagery from classic surrealist paintings: René Magritte's bowler hats, fishes, trains, odd mirrors and the prominently featured green apple from ""The Son of Man"" meet Salvador Dali's floating ""Eye"" and the dripping clocks from ""The Persistence of Memory"". The structures you're walking on echo Chirico, but they're obviously mainly inspired by the perspective bending optical illusions of Escher's ""Relativity"" and his ""Ascending and Descending"" staircases. Even the little creature you control seems plucked straight out of a Hieronymus Bosch nightmare. The result is a bright, clean, colourful and charming comic style that actually represents its impressive bucket of inspirations brilliantly well.The unfortunate thing is that these inspirations remain the backdrop and wrapping of the game, they never really leap onto the gameplay.I can count one or maybe, if I'm charitable, two puzzles that somewhat utilize odd perspectives and optical illusions; the rest of the game is a conventional, uninspired puzzler of rather low difficulty, with some real time elements. You are asked to escort the clockwise-only sleepwalking Bob back to bed, by placing apples as blocks and fishes as platforms, while avoiding leaps into the void, angry wolves and killer whale-trains. Despite the timing elements, the game rarely punishes you for failing (Bob mostly just respawns), and therefore there is no real sense of urgency - which will be a positive thing for some folks and a negative for others. There are 30 something levels to the game, some of which are very very short, and after finishing them (in about an hour) ""nightmare mode"" is unlocked: The same levels, with the extra objective of collecting a number of keys, an addition that forces you to rethink the level's pathfinding and makes the game more challenging. I may or may not revisit the game to finish the rest of these, but frankly, with no real new elements being introduced, game+ feels very much like it should have been the original game instead of an attempt to prolong its length, and therefore doesn't feel worth (re-)playing.This disconnect between gameplay and graphics makes the game feel somewhat of a disappointment. It is a pity that the developers would choose to tackle such a unique theme, only to then ignore it completely when designing the actual gameplay. It makes the whole experience feel sadly shallow.Thankfully the soundtrack and the minimal yet interesting and well placed audio cues from the creepy narrator (""The apple is a hat..."") enhance the game's dream-like atmosphere and reinforce the feeling of floating within a surreal dream. Another plus is the general feeling of polish: Technically I encountered no problems and all the expected player conveniences are there, including pause and fast-forward buttons and the ability to mute the game's music and/or sound effects. However I would advise anyone to play with a controller; playing with a mouse feels unintuitive and fiddly.So yes, I do recommend the game, with caveats. It is an interesting world to traverse, a beautiful art style to walk through and the smart sound design will allow you to transport yourself into a surrealist painting for the short time the game lasts. It is unfortunate that there are so few interesting things to do within that painting though, so maybe you'll wonna wait for a discount."

Stunning visuals, fun premise, good execution and — at times — surprisingly hectic for a ""casual"" (for lack of a better term) game. Some of the puzzles feel a bit short/simple, so if you're looking for a super challenging puzzler, this isn't it. However, it's a very enjoyable and somehow relaxing game (even if it does mess with your spatial perception on a regular basis) — and a very beautiful one at that. Go take a look at the trailer on the store page, it's very accurate, and see if it makes you tick."
76561198025902156,Not Recommended,308040,17422265,"Posted: 6 August, 2015",all,(AB) Slow Moth,"Back To Bed is an isometric puzzle game where you manipulate the enviorenment around a character (Bob) so you can help them get, well, back to bed. The art style is strong, emulates classic surrealism like Dali, Magritte and Escher, and fits the mood perfectly. The game is very good at introducing new puzzle element at a decent pace. The puzzles never get too tediuous, and the mechanics work with it's style.But with all this, I can't say I very much like this game. It's not very hard. There are only 30 levels, plus 30 extra levels of ""Nightmare Mode"", which are variations. Most of the levels usually consist of going and fetching objects which are out of the way, then placing them in some proper spot, which isn't very enticing puzzle design. It's not necessarily bad, but it didn't grab me. I felt as though not enough of them engaged other puzzle solving techniques. I can't recall many distinct or gratifying levels in the game. Maybe it's because none of these levels feel really inspired. In fact, very little in Back to Bed feels inspired. I guess that's the real issue I have with this game. It feels like a game I've already played a thousand times before."
76561198112866114,Recommended,308040,28094338,"Posted: 30 November, 2016",all,kyzka,"Back to Bed was originally developed by a number of Denmark students which can be found herehttp://www.bedtime.io/about. It's predominantly a casual puzzle game where you play as 'Subob' a subconscious version of Bob who for some reason is dressed as a condom/balloon animal with Bob's face plastered on it. Bob the main protagonist of the game suffers with both narcolepsy and sleep walking and your goal as Subob is to guide Bob back to his bedroom door by strategically placing giant apples in his pathway. In the long run this is pretty easy to master because Bob only sleepwalks in a clockwise direction every time he hits an object. It’s only made slightly more difficult by the fact that there are often various obstacles placed on each landscape which will wake Bob up if he ever hits one. This includes alarm clocks on wheels, manholes with teeth, ravaging dogs and a whale train which will run bob over if he ever walks onto the train tracks.The quirky art atmosphere is in homage to Salvador Dali and a few placed audio winks here and there to the TV show 'Twin Peaks'. There are a handful of cut scenes as you traverse the 30 maps and once completed you are rewarded by 'Nightmare Mode' which is the exact same 30 maps again with the added problem that you need to now collect from 1-3 door keys by having Bob walk into them before you guide him to his bedroom door. As you can imagine the keys are never placed in straight forward locations and might require you to stop and plan your routes a bit more.Bob always respawns if he ever walks off the map, so it’s easy to let Bob loop himself while you survey the landscape and its many pitfalls. An odd puzzle here and there made me stop and think a bit harder, but none ever got me to the point where I was scurrying for a walkthrough. The biggest downfall is that there really isn't any engaging story here, at first I thought maybe there would be some type of story about why Bob was required to remain asleep for the 30 levels due to some type of coma and any induced awakening might harm Bob due to severe brain trauma, but no I was way off course. In end Bob simply wakes up. Bob's subconscious latex pet smiles and still exists with Bob in the real world and you get to see that the 'Obstacles' in game were simply pictures that Bob has in bedroom which Bob must have subconsciously drew from. Since Bob wakes up in the end with no drama's, your left sitting there at the end wondering why didn't I just wake Bob back at level 1? What the hell was all that about? And other than the fact that you got to solve 60 fairly easy puzzles, the whole thing seemed rather pointless and more of a simple timewaster between other more meaningful games that you play.However its appeal for many is its simplicity, allowing another 100% completed game to your steam profile an easy endeavour. With that said, completionists should be aware that the speed runner achievement will ONLY activate if you log into game fresh and complete 1-30 in 45 minutes in 1 sitting. While you are doing this I would also recommend simply fast forwarding Bob to his death when it comes to the various obstacles as that also needs to be unlocked in 1 sitting. This means that the game will require more often than not for you to play through it twice, giving the total playtime of the game somewhere between 2-4 hrs.In the end a promising puzzle game which yawn fully stays lullaby in its difficulty and length. A game that is best suited for someone who likes to play games between power naps. Wait for a sale...Below is me playing a few of the first levels. It's enough of a sample. I wouldn't want to ruin everything for you...https://youtu.be/8So7r6RbNck"

,Recommended,308040,23508635,"Posted: 11 June, 2016",all,thainen,"A short brain-teaser that feels more like a demo-version than a complete game. It consists of 30 levels, all with the same mechanic: a guy sleepwalks through a surreal, Rene Magritte-inspired dreamscape, going straight until he hits an obstacle, which makes him turn clockwise, or encounters a hazard, which wakes him up. You play as his alter-ego, carrying around apples (portable obstacle) and fish (portable bridge), helping him to reach his bed safely.Once you get the trick, puzzles become trivial. Even the ""nightmare mode"", which requires you to collect keys before sending your sleepwalker to the bed, doesn't add much challenge. ""Back to Bed"" is one of these games that would earn a ""sideways thumb"" if Steam allowed it: somewhat fun, but nothing special to write home about, completely interchangeable with anything else in its genre.A mildly difficult, mildly enjoyable brain-teaser with a mildly pleasant visual style. It gives enough fun for its little price."

,Not Recommended,308040,25666900,"Posted: 24 September, 2016",all,pantra,"Back to Bed has pleasing art but lacks substance.The game starts out simple and stays that way for the most part. There's very little challenge involved. Most puzzles are too simple and unsatisfying to solve. The first well thought out levels start appearing in the second set, which is after the first 15. But even then it's more tedium than fun. There's little fun in picking up and aggregating all the apples and fish distributed around a level before you can place them, just busywork to arrange a solution that's usually obvious.Also the logic as to what constitutes a failstate feels unfair and inconsistent: You can let Bob walk off edges all you want, he'll just respawn and you can continue with your puzzle progress. That's fine and motivating. But should he walk into an enemy or just a hole on a tile, then all your level progress gets reset and you have to retry from the beginning. In some stages like 2-12, where you can arrange multiple bridges, this gets annoying fast.There's some occasional nice challenge later in nightmare mode, like in level 3-8, but that's just too little too late."

It plays casually but also provides good brain bending puzzle elements later in the game.  The music that accompanies each level is varied enough to keep it fresh and awesome.  The graphics are simple, yet clear to make it easier to recognize the puzzles.  The basic concept of what to do is simple, get him out of his dream/nightmare but don't wake him up.  There are a good amount of levels, and trying them on different difficulties - DEFINATELY makes a huge difference.  This game on the hardest difficulty is one tough cookie.  It's definately worth around 10 hours of game play if you can and want to replay it on higher difficulties (which are insanely challenging)."

The gameplay is interesting in that you still can move stuff around while Bob is walking, permitting different strategies to solve the levels.It's not a very long or hard puzzle game if you're an hardcore solver, i got near the end of my first run in an hour without ever spending 5 minutes on a level yet.

The original art direction keeps it fresh and it all sounds good.  There is enough guidance for anything new which is encountered and it loads quickly.  If you are after a not-too-difficult puzzler in casual doses this game does the trick.  Be warned, it is a very short game.  7/10"

Esher would feel right at home in, all with the purpose of guiding a helpless narcoleptic to his bedroom. The levels aren’t particularly challenging, even in nightmare mode where you need to collect keys to unlock the bedroom door. Since this game goes for about $2 (or less on sales) I’m willing to give it a free pass just because of the trippy art style and voiceovers. Just don’t expect something that will last you more than an hour or two."

Great fun game, but its replay value came in about a year when you just want a fun small game to breeze through while you wait for a meating. Kind of hard for you Mac people that don't have a mouse. My mac book handle this just fine but the fine tuneing moves get a little hared with WASD. Awsome game and great experianse for anyone that likes puzzles."

But most of it can also be solved by trial & error. Puzzles are fair, not too hard and you can try them as often as you want and need.I kinda like the lovely, butveryweird style, even for a dreamworld. All the optical illusions and that strange voice with rearranged words from sentences are giving me a unsettling feeling, but still relaxing and enjoyable at the same time. It's hard to describe how exactly it feels, but hey, if i would have dreams like that in real, then i wouldn't even try to describe it and rather take my medications before sleeping.Overall, it's good entertainment for about 2-3 hours and i would really recommend it."
