,Recommended,308060,11080110,"Posted: 4 July, 2014",all,sotheysayy,The game reminds me a lot of Limbo which is a great thing because Limbo was an amazing indie game! This game really has the potential at being a really good game. So far I have played 4 levels and I am enjoying it. I have come across quite a few different bugs that made playing a couple of time a bit annoying. But I wasn't expecting this to be perfect in the first place due to this being an early access game. If you like side scrollers and solving puzzles then I would say give the game a try and show the developers some support!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe0p14HABcI&list=UUUI5L-pyfuGa2l_IlG1d7_Q
76561198017548020,Recommended,308060,33616803,Posted: 17 July,all,Blahu,"1st of all I'll start by saying that I'm Romanian, so I'm biased about the feeling and atmosphere of the game. I've bought the game because I loved Inside and Limbo and wanted to support our fellow devs. What I got was a good sidescroller puzzle if you're not familiar with comunist history of Romania, and a piece of art if you were born and raised under the regime.Technical stuff is pretty straightforward, nice minimalistic graphics and very well done atmosphere, decent and ""opressive"" music and sounds, polished and good controls. The overall game is very good, especially if you liked abovementioned Limbo/Inside titles.Now, for the feeling, this is really something that will bring back memories. There are many references to our history and in the end of the game you'll have a nice surprise ( Spoiler alert:some real pictures from our history, past and more recent)The stores in the game are actual name of stores  from our comunist era, but written in reverse. The names are actual foods like Lapte = Milk or Carne = Meat, those were considered very high valuable commodities in the last years of communist regime, and very scarce and hard to find. Most of the people were real hungy and I remember dreaming of a chicken steak sometimes.There's a silhouette of a fairy wheel at some point which reminds me of the one of the few entertainments we had as kids, back in the days.The workers looking at a VCR in the underground, the crowded bus, the ""Export"" labeled boxes ...all are part of our painful history, and most of the people playing the game, won't get it. :)And those are just several of the many many references across all chapters. It brings back memories, melancoly and sadness, but I guess we, romanians, are well versed in living with those feelings.10/10 from me, probably an 6-7-8/10 for a foreigner.#rezist ma bucur pentru joc, ma bucur ca apar si eu undeva la final fiind unul din piata atat la revolutie in 89 cat si recent in 2017.

But what I can tell you is that this game has a lot of potential. I've been following this game since the very beginning, and I am pleased with how far this game has progressed. Right now, there's not much content (only 5 chapters), so don't expect too much when purchasing it right now. However, the price is affordable, and it's worth it, for me, to see this game constantly getting better and better. Are there bugs? You'd better believe it. No amount of bugspray can keep these pesky things away. But with each update, it's gotten better. Overall, I do recommend this game. In its current state, no, I wouldn't recommend it, but I genuinely believe this game will get better and finally end up becoming a great game. Please support the developer and buy it as early as possible. Right now, you are making a long-term investment in a game that could someday be amazing. So please, support this developer. Buy this game. It'll be worth it."

When I first saw the Steam page, it reminded me of LIMBO. It has the same visual style about it and it is a side-scroller. I like that it has guns and a hide mechanic. Though, you can choose to sneak your way through or go guns blazing. You can see my video of me playing the first 2 levels with commentary:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gc9EtKEwbQ"

Black has a lot of small, but lovingly crafted moments that are metaphors of what life under communism was like. It's almost poetic in its rendition of this very dark subject matter. The bleak landscapes you'll be navigating are beautiful and atmospheric. Definitely a game to experience!As a Romanian, the material speaks to me more than it does to non-Romanians but it's worth playing regardless of where you're from. Black is a well designed game that looks and sounds great and that any fan of Inside & Co. will totally love."
,Recommended,308060,34118024,Posted: 8 August,all,wayneJK,"Cautiously recommend.Similar to INSIDE in many ways -- run left to right, solve puzzles to overcome obstacles, out-run and out-smart your oppressive captors -- but unfortunately the art direction and overall presentation come up a bit short by comparison.Like the game's protagonist, puzzles feel constrained, or just unclear, lacking those satifying ""aha!"" moments when you've solved them. Instead of thinking my way through some puzzles, I ""found"" solutions by pressing the ""use"" key every few steps just to see if I could interact with something. Drudgery rather than delight.The good does outweigh the bad though. At times, the character animation and art direction is reminiscent of the classic platformer Flashback. The puzzle mechanics unfold throughout the game to become more challanging and offer fresh ways to interact, thereby not allowing things to get too stale. (There's even a few clever puzzles to solve too!) All in all, being a runner-up to INSIDE is not a bad thing at all."

,Recommended,308060,33721544,Posted: 22 July,all,MAD,"Black The Fall is an amazing game from start to finish. It manages to paint a very grim environment in colors reminiscent of Half Life. The game picks up fast with several puzzles, guiding you through the levels a bit more that I would've wanted as a fan of the genre. The graphics are great and the camera movement made me feel like I was observing the character from the outside. Very fluid, very natural, with perspective changes, always tilting and panning, making every area a painting to admire. A lot of references to communism and communist Romania, many secrets hidden in plain sight and plenty more to discover. The achievement for the secrets is actually finding them, not the reward. Each secret area helps the dramatic imagery and has a direct connection to real life events. The dialogue and spoken lines can be both funny and sad (if you can understand Romanian it'll feel like a bonus!). An emotional rollercoaster as shown by the final minutes of the game displaying areas very well known from a historical point of view from Bucharest, combined with the prisoner number of our hero and the very powerful images moments before the credits.The game made me laugh, gave me goosebumps and made me cry and I'm not ashamed of admitting it.I want more."

,Recommended,308060,34045460,Posted: 5 August,all,Yuusou Amazing,"A nice atmosperic puzzle game about the communism era under the Soviets, although the game itself is set in an alternate reality of that era. The game has more depth to it if you talk with the devs (which I did back in 2016) or get some interviews with them, since the explanations about what you experience in the game will make a lot more sense. Many of these puzzles refer to living and working in the communist era. Sometimes you need patience or stay in line or go back and forth a lot to actually move forward and at all times you have to hide, even when you're exposed wide open to the threat.The visuals are good, the sounds are very industrial and the atmospheric background music fits well into each of the scenes. While some might complain the lack of details in the graphics between the puzzles, there are some scenes presenting you with some serious problems of that world. Many of these might be exaggerated, yet there's a little truth hidden in each of them.The gameplay is a bit of a mixed feeling: I like the evolution of having first nothing at hands, then the designator and later the little robotic critter. However the last one got me stuck in two riddles due to not knowing how to actually reach the solution (although I knew what the solution was). Then there was another puzzle that got me stuck due to the controls not being entirely clear in that scene (a ride with the bus). It's a tough game design decision to limit the control related hints and go without text entirely, so I have some respect for it, since it worked out for 95% of the puzzles without hints. All other puzzles were quite good although I usually don't play puzzle games anymore. I like the 2.5D setup of the scenes, as it reminds me of Pandemonium (a Jump'n'Run game from the mid 90's) and adds layers to the puzzles, allowing for more complex puzzle setups in certain scenes. Many puzzles are trial and error puzzles, where the character just gets killed if you do it wrong. It can be frustrating at times, if preparations for the solution takes a minute or two and you need to start over again. My gameplay time of 3 hours is average, yet I would've expected a bit more content after finishing the game.Nonetheless I liked the game despite the mixed experience regarding the gameplay. If you have been living in the Soviet Union, it might be worth just to experience the scenes and compare it with your own memories of that era."

76561198059342678,Not Recommended,308060,33487252,Posted: 12 July,all,Jake Mistake,"For an in-depth review, tune into the video below:https://youtu.be/Zho4nNUOix0Otherwise, here’s a summarized write up.StoryInspired by the Romanian’s Communist regime that ended in 1989, Black the Fall focuses solely on the tale of an unnamed machinist trying to escape the facility. The story is likely only going to appeal to a specific set of people. Whilst playing, we witness many scenes that play out as a form of symbolism to the real-life conditions during Romania’s Communist regime (eg. Poor working conditions and abusive authority) but that’s really the extent of the narrative.There are no memorable characters, no spoken dialogue and no distinct personalities. Essentially if you aren’t interested in how this parallels to Romania’s past, then you’ll likely find no compelling factor in the story.GameplayBTF is a slide scrolling puzzler where the objective of each puzzle is to get from the left to the right side of the screen. It’s easier to understand the puzzles if you separate between the ones inside the facility (section 1) to those outside of it (section 2).Both sections include simple platforming, avoiding getting seen by enemies and interacting with brightly lit switches that do things like opening doors. At times, you’ll platform your way to the objective but very early in the game puzzles start to focus on a laser pointer you come across that allows you to control nearby workers to activate switches you can’t reach. You can also manually control the pointer to point toward light-sensitive panels to activate things in the environment.Section 1 puzzles for the most part are pretty simple, since most of them take place in a small area with very few items to interact with and therefore very little experimentation. There are some puzzles in section 1 that are bigger in scale but these are few and far between. Besides the simple straightforward puzzles using the laser pointer, you also have a few interesting ones that surprise you now and again with how ‘neat’ they are. I say that because you’re not going to think it was anything more than mildly clever in terms of its difficulty.Even the interesting puzzles in section 1 can still be seen as rather simple. An example is a puzzle that requires you to listen for nearby environmental hazards and move forward in the dark using you sense of hearing. Not particularly difficult but a ‘neat’ addition nonetheless.In section 2, puzzles change because you also get a new robot companion. This time, you can use your laser pointer to direct him to specific areas, effectively giving you 2 players to control. Puzzles here are more complex by comparison because of the increased scale allowing for more interactable items per puzzle and, with it, more experimentation.Also, this is where the game introduces puzzles that require the robot’s help and since the robot’s moveset is more diverse than just moving left and right (it can swim while you cannot), it makes for more creative puzzle design. It’s clear that section 2 has the more challenging puzzles but even then, they were never difficult enough for me to feel stumped or to force me to pause for minutes on end.Ultimately when looking at all the puzzles as a whole I would say most of them are simple to decent in difficulty. From that category, only about 25 percent of them are ‘neat’ or an interesting twist to make you go ‘huh, never thought of that’. The rest are either just really easy which is a problem in terms of value since the game already doesn’t have a lot of puzzles to begin with.Pros1) decent presentation – nice minimalistic visuals for character designs and nice sound effects. BGM takes a more ambient role.2) some puzzles are genuinely an interesting execution of mechanicsCons1) most puzzles are simple – gets better in section 2 but they still don’t pose a significant enough challenge2) the story is likely only to be appreciated by a small set of people – no conventional narrative to enjoy.ConclusionBlack the fall is a short game, but above all else, it is a puzzler that doesn’t sport a lot of difficult challenges. Most are simple to decent at best with about a quarter of that portion being interesting in a unexpected manner. Taking that into consideration with the fact that most people aren’t going to be invested in the Communist setting, it’s difficult to justify the value proposition. As such, I’m going to recommend that you wait for a sale on this one, probably till it’s about 10 dollars. And that’s pretty much it for the review."

I bought this game as an early access title kinda expecting a cheap limbo knockoff, and when i first played it... it was. it was bad, it was clunky, and ugly, and i just kind of forgot about it. But when it was officially released I saw all these trailers and I thought ""ok, this looks nothing like what i remember"", so I gave it another shot (and another 15$), and i'm glad i did. First off, don't go expecting a Playdead game, cuz it's not. While it's 2D, side-scrolling and full of atmosphere, it feels nothing like the wonderful Playdead games, it has its own thing going on, and while it's not nearly as perfectly polished as those games, it is definitely worth your time if this kind of game at all works for you. It's interesting, clever, good-looking and for people like me who remember how it started, a VAST improvement. Hats off."
