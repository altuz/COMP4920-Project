,Recommended,308330,13011919,"Posted: 19 November, 2014",all,ros,"'Zerzura' is a traditional point and click adventure. On seeing its logo you might suspect it to be a hidden object game. But is a point and click adventure with a reasonable plot and length of playtime.The game is based around two young men around 20 years old in Spain during the time of the Inquisition. One of them fancies himself as a competitior to Leonardo Da Vinci. Lots of the puzzles are centered around him inventing things. His brother is early on sought out by the Inquisition and the rest of the game is centered around the younger brother  finding him and then discovering why he was so persecuted.The game mechanics are very much old adventure game style. You can talk with people to advance the plot, use objects together to create new devices and use things in your inventory with objects in the environment to help your character.Best points:The graphics are really quite pretty.Useful highlighting of hot spots.The soundtrack is nothing exceptional but decent.The voice acting for the English version is really very good.The plot is engaging until just before the end. The ending itself is a bit dull.Worst points:The main character thinks he's some kind of genius of invention but the puzzle solutions involve some bad, bad ideas. People that understand Physics and Engineering need to prepare themselves for covering their eyes and forgiving the writers.The main character needs an injection of personality.The main character develops a disturbing case of Stockholm syndrome which makes a small chunk of the game just feel weird.In summary: The game's main flaws are the about main character but he isn't too annoying to stop the game being worth buying. It's an above mediocre point and click with good production but occasionally mad puzzle design."

The art, puzzles, and atmosphere are all top notch. I am not super into point & click adventure games, but this one stands out for me. The setting is simply great, and all the little details are really amazing. I highly recommend this game to any adventure game enthusiast, or even causual gamers who like a good story with some challenging, but solvable puzzles.Its tone is a little like lost Horizon (similar title with no relation), but the production value and art style of Zerzura is far more evolved.Overall, this is a great game that is well worth your time, even at full price, which is $10 cheaper then the boxed version."

It doesn't look too bad. Initially I noticed a bit of contrast between the the 3D and 2D but these usually seemed to blend together most of the time. The game nice peaceful music playing at all times.It's a point and click adventure problem solving game. You inspect objects, pick stuff up, use objects together to find solutions to problems. It is typical sort of stuff you in the genre.It is not a fast game. You spend a lot of time listening to the protagonist's monologue about everything you try to do or look at. There is a lot trial an error finding solutions to objectives. Some of the dialogue is amusing; the protagonist is an inventor and does not speak kindly of Da Vinci who is a rival inventor for him. I kind of liked the part where you actually 'design' inventions by sitting down in the workshop and drawing sketches by combining ideas together. Some of them look pretty funny.The game isn't too bad. I wouldn't of it's kind but I couldn't find any major problems with it. I would recommend is looking for games like this.Clickherefor more let’s play videos =)"

I bought this game more on a whim, because my first impression was it was a hidden object game. Very bad advertising work, nothing really charmed me into buying other than the fact that i am a hardcore adventure gamer and one of the trailers looked promising.The game turned out to be a lot better than expected, a very enjoyable experience. The strongest point of the game are the puzzles, logical and entertaining. The story is not bad either, fitted with a nice historical angle, althoughcould have been a little more developed. Still, very entertaining and a must buy for all adventure lovers."

76561198010489984,Recommended,308330,30144902,Posted: 24 February,all,jennyene,This is excellent point and click adventure and should be enjoyable to those who love these kind of games.The puzzles mostly involve manipuation of object and various combinations between them.They fall a bit on the hard side but they are very rewarding.The graphics are excellent and the locations that you visit are variable with only the animations of the characters lacking but that is not a significant problem.For those of us not having english as our native language there are a few words (technical terms and objects ) that you may have to look up.I also want to praise the voice over (for the most part ) and especiallly the protagonist.Last but not least for my is the sense of calm and dreamy atmosphere that you acquire by playing this game (excellent after a hard day at the work.Very highly recommended for the absurdly low price (0.99) that i got it
,Recommended,308330,20654849,"Posted: 20 January, 2016",all,aaronwc,"Traditional point and click game with all of the pros and cons usually inherent in the style.  The game has beautiful 2d art with a surprisingly varied number of sets in many different locales. An enticing story placed just close enough to believable to preserve immersion while being whimsical enough to keep some air of mystery and curiousity.The puzzles are pretty good in my opinion.  I'm sure the case could be made that some are too easy compared to other point and clicks but I found it refreshing that most of them actually made sense. Logic is usually enough to get though each scenario and only a couple of times did I need to resort to the ""ol' rub everything I am currently carrying against everything in the environment 'till something happens"" routine.The mechanics are basically what you might expect and are solid.  My one very minor ""gripe"" in this regard may be the inventory which ""auto-hides"" a bit too quicly for my taste.The character animations are fairly clunky at times with jarring walk/run animations and some oddly paced cut-scenes (ex. two characters having a sword fight loses some excitment when the swords clearly phase through eachother at odd movement speeds)  The voice acting is pretty good with a surprising amount of decently written dialog.  My only complaint here is the accents which don't always fit the character or the setting.If you can grab it on sale like I did, there is quite a lot of value here.  My complaints are pretty minor and if you appreciate a good point and click which is ""true to form""  you will enjoy Lost Chronicles of Zerzura.  I know I certainly did!"
76561198217803220,Recommended,308330,18238660,"Posted: 28 September, 2015",all,Slightly Sleeping,"If you like classic point & click adventures this game is not a bad purchase, especially if it's on sale.Not among the best, but far from the worst of the genre, it's good for somewhere around 15 leisurely paced hours of entertainment.Most of the puzzles are fairly easy, and some bordering on trivial, but a few may cause some headscratching and the dreaded try everything with everything else syndrome common to the genre. I only found one of them nonsensical enough to be really frustrating however, as for the most part things made plausible sense.Another common problem with this type of game is pixelhunting, when some utterly insignificant part of the screen happens to contain an important hot-spot that is almost indistinguishable from it's surroundings. There a a couple of those in this game, likea small nail in a wallanda slightly irregular spot in the sand.This is not a big deal though, because there is a hot-spot indicator in the game that you can turn on or off as you please.Graphically I'd say it's atmospheric and nice looking, but nothing to write home about. Some animations look a little silly or jerky from time to time, but there really isn't much movement going on aside from your charachter running around anyway, so no biggie.As for audio, there is sound, and there is also music, none of it terrible or out of place and none of it particularly good.The voice acting is mostly low key and imo mediocre, but not bad.The story and writing is ok if you don't expect too much from it. The greatest weakness, I think, is that the characters are flat, predictable and uninteresting. Also, the ending is ridiculously underwhelming.Now, looking at this review, one might think this game is mediocre at best. Well, it may not be a masterpiece, but I found my playthrough enjoyable despite a few shortcomings. There are better games, yes, but there is also a ton of much worse ones. All in all it beats watching TV and if you get it on sale i'ts well worth the money."
,Recommended,308330,13992464,"Posted: 15 January, 2015",all,killuallnow198019801980,"A VERY worthy TRY in adventure games.The games plot is really adventurous. You're an inventor that his brother is interested by Inquisition. The brother studies the artifacts that an uncle sends all the time as presents. Because of those the brother is arrested by the Inquisition and the story begins. In the start of the game you try to build the first flying machine ever and you finally do to escape the Inquisition. You try to save your brother. You travel to South Spain where you come across a girl, a pirate Captain's daughter. You travel with them and their ship was sunk by the Inquisition. The only survivors is you and the girl. You escape nearly to the pirates hide out and from there to Africa to save the brother, in the legendary ""Tripoli"" city and from there to the desert and Zerzura,the Lost White City, where they have the secret of immortality.In your journey, you make inventions of the time trying to bypass things. The game is NOT difficult. For someone that has logic and played some adventures it will be incredibly easy. I finished it in 12 ours with the hotspots on. Someone that will NOT use the feature he'll may finish it in 14 hours. The game is really easy. Like many adventures of our time the game's target is to travel us and entertain us, not to stuck us on a riddle.A really minus is when the inquisition tries to arrest you several times and there you have time limit, as much the one move that you have to think of. In any other case the character is murdered in front of your eyes and the game exits in the menus. Before every scene of that kind there is an autosave and you just can press the Continue game option. So , don't bother. But the fact that you'll die many times before you find the solution is really irritating.The graphics are 3D from every perspective. A modern game. Though ,you'll not find the best textures, the picture quality is really good and it even supports HD. There are NO cinematics in the cutscenes. That's a minus. Just the story teller that says some words and hand drawn sketches but no complete pictures. Like a cutscene but no cutscene at all. Let's say they didn't want to make the background just black in those few words that the storry teller says. Anyway, from  every other perspective the graphics are fine. When you take things or combine them , the style is like the older games. You just see the hands to move in most cases.The sounds are not the best but are really good. The quality is of the voices fair as much as the speaking. Ok with the music,too.One thing that I liked much is the saves speed. You really could NOT say that you really were saving a game. You pressed ok and it was instant. The computer never slowed down.With an interesting story line and plot, good graphics, modern game features. I would say that we have to do with a very good game. Some could take it aside ""Lost Horizon"" because of the plot. But the last one is really MORE... As much is older the game promises more. ""Lost Chronicles of Zerzura"" in the other hand is made by people that make a good entry at this market.But in any case you have to try it! It's really entertaining and the story line is sand box like,thing that make it really interesting!HAVE FUN!"

,Not Recommended,308330,17620282,"Posted: 19 August, 2015",all,paul,"Like a lot of point & click games Zerzura suffers from frustratingly unintuitive gameplay that has you clicking everything onto everything in the hope of progression. As such it ends up being a stop often to consult the walkthrough simulator.That would be O.K. if the story was good. But, there's not a lot to recommend that either. You have two orphaned brothers. One of whom, the main character, is an inventor. The other is trying to find their people's lost city. What's so important about this lost city? You know, magic, the falback choice for lazy writers everywhere.There's the usual cartoonish villain who wants to get to the city also. And, there's a corsair woman who exists to be the main character's love interest, I guess, and to seek revenge for her father's death. I write ""I guess"" about the love interest thing because the game lets us know by giving you the option to have the main character give her some flowers, and, later, they receive a magical amulet, that neither of them asked for, that binds them together. So yeah, that's the game."

The grapchis are okay but the interface isn't great, even how to save/load a game too me a bit of time to figure out. Also, although it seems like a very minor point, I didn't like the appearance of the text that is used to indentiy items, it seemed very ""computerish"", which lessened the immersion factor.If you have a less than positive initial impression of the game, I would recommend that you try and work past that and continue playing. It does become enjoyable once you get use to everything. After a couple of hours of gameplay I started to really enjoy the game."

Of all such adventure games I've played, there are more puzzles in this one that make sense than most.

Good for passing the time.The puzzles are either easy, or... odd, but this fits well with the main character, who is an inventor. Using items in a 'non-standard' way.
