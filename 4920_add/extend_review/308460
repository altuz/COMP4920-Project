,Not Recommended,308460,11080882,"Posted: 5 July, 2014",all,banzaimonkey,"War in a Box is a basic tower defense game. The graphical style is pretty inspired -- everything looks like it's made out of cardboard and paper and the levels look like a child's playset. You can move the camera just about anywhere and there's also an option to see the game from a tower's perspective (watching it fire at enemy units). The art is definitely top notch.On the flip side, the gameplay mechanics are not very sophisticated. The tower defense genre has dozens of titles that have innovative twists and interesting mechanics. This game is a bit lacking in that department. Towers are placed in a few fixed positions and have 3 levels of upgrades. Towers and upgrades are instant and there aren't any extra buttons to press. There are no end of level stats or bonuses for leftover money, and while upgraded towers do more damage I couldn't see numbers anywhere.One mechanic of the game that is somewhat interesting is that each unit, tower, and bullet fired is modelled in the physics engine. This means that trees and destroyed units can block the trajectory of your tower's bullets, and sometimes units go flying off the screen when they are destroyed. It also adds some randomness, since some tower shots may be blocked and this throws off the timing for a wave.All in all, though, the game is too simplistic for my taste. The art style is cool. But tower defense as a genre is a bit played out and this game adds nothing innovative to keep me interested."

It's absurdly addictive :)Really wasn't expecting much of anything from this title at all.I bought it on sale figuring it'd make a nice mindless game for my 6 year old son.  As it turned out, it made a nice mindless game for Dad - LOL.  No kidding, I love it!Waves and waves of progressively harder enemy armored cars, tanks, and planes attempt to navigate the maze of defensive measures you place to stop them.  You start off each battle with a set amount of cash to buy pre-positioned guns.  As you kill the enemy tanks and planes, you get more cash to buy new guns or upgrade existing ones.There is nothing to the manning of the emplacements (they fire by themselves)... the skill comes with what type of gun to buy, when to get it, where to put it, and in what sequence.  A sole gun in the right (or wrong)  place at the right (or wrong) time can make the difference between plastering the enemy before he gets his steam up, or getting overrun by the hun.The music is a blend of cheesy bravado-style muscle pumping arcade noise - that somehow meshes perfectly with the action (I wouldn't change it).  The interface is remarkably easy (took me all of 10 seconds to figure it out - with no manual), and the entertainment value is undeniable.  For those who would complain about the graphics, I say they are perfect for what it is.  For those who would call the game too repetitive, I would guess they were not around decades ago to enjoy the genre of arcade games like Pacman, Asteroids, or Space Invaders.1 out of 10 if you're looking for Company of Heroes or Men at War; 10 out of 10 if you're looking for a few hours to kill (""just one more turn"" anyone? - LOL)"

For a simplistic idea of a cardboard box kids play area they sure put a lot into making this game look really really stunning. If this had more more to it, less retrictive placement of guns, control of route of tanks, Build AA along side cannons. There would be a little replay value. But there is not. Once you figure out the map win placemt there's no point in playing it again.  Worth getting for the $2 sale but not full price unless they add some content."

Something they did wrong is give you the option to look troug hthe eyes of a turret, does it allow you to controll it? No, you can just look trough it. Which is a big dissapointment. It feld like watching a friend play your favorite game and you were not allowed to join in.A typical game to pass the time. Artstyle is enjoyable, the paper and cardboard cutouts.Overal i find this game a like or hate it. Fun to play for a few minutes but nothing fancy.If i may recomend a tower defence game that is similair to this but a bit better, try Toy Soldiers. It is set in a WW1 theme and is hilarious to play and see."

Lets break it down.Graphics-Awesome for this type of game, the paper idea is spot on, and also 3d, what more could you ask for?  Everything from the turrets to enemies look great.  The maps are well laid out as well.Music-Skip the music not the best.Levels-First 10 were fairly easy, but by 11 things got really tough, had to really think about my tatics.  You are looking at about 5-10 hours of game time.  Not bad for a budget title.Turrets-5 to chose from, machine gun nest, anti-tank gun, flak gun, arty, telsa coil.  3 upgrades avaible as well.  Cool thing with these, you can look through the turret in a first person view.Gameplay-Some of the best in tower-def i've had so far.  Can have some really intense moments that come down to seconds, had me on the edge of my seat many times.

There is a good selection of uprgradable towers, but not so many that the amount of choice is overwhelming.  You've got all the tools you need: machine guns, mortars, cannons, flak guns, etc.  The maps are interesting (and challenging as you get further into the game).  Limited tower placement sites, as well as limited line-of-sight, adds to the challenge on many of the maps.  The game speed can be controlled as well -- speed up when you're mowing down your enemies, slow down when you need to re-think your strategies.I had tons of fun playing this.  It's entertaining, and it's only $5.  Win-win!  Highly recommened."

The best thing that can be said about it are the graphics. I don't know why every month or so I go back and try to beat it on expert to get all the stars. Everytime I do, I play level 12 and remember that there are 4 towers, the enemies vs towers balancing is bad, the number of places you can put towers quickly maxes out, there are 3 upgrades maximum for each tower, and there is no reason for me to ever play this game again. By writing this I am absolving myself of ever trying again because apparently the developers did not bother playtesting the game themselves. Apparently no one wanted to be a beta tester for this junk.Don't be fooled by the positive reviews into buying this. I have wasted hundreds of hours on TD games and War in a Box belongs in my bottom 5 list. Not only is it mediocre, it quickly becomes unfun due to its limited and poor design as though it were someone's senior project for a video game design class and/or a quick cash grab. In fact, I can only think of one TD game I have disliked more than this, but then again I'm more of a dumpster diver than living full time in the trash."

If you can't tell from the screenshots, it is a Tower Defense game made from cardboard. I bought this game when it was -80% (CDN$ 1.09) just as an impulse buy to kill an afternoon. I can say it is an ok game.PROS:- Turret First Person View. Clicking on a turret and selecting the button lets you see from the turrets view. Really cool, but you can't do anything other than watch. (Would have been cool if you could control the turret.)- Interesting level design, with great graphical design. The cannons look ok, and the enemies look great!- Obstacles like tree and dead enemies can block your attacks, or even the terrain.- Short, only 24 missions with Normal and Hard difficulty.- Simple AchievementsNow here is where I nick-pick.CONS:- Towers can ONLY be placed in designated areas. Because of this, if you don't place the CORRECT tower that is needed to beat the level, you will lose. There is basically only 1 way to win each level. Some are super easy to figure out, others not so much. Very ""Trial and Error"".- Only 5 towers. Certain levels will take away towers as a challenge, making certain levels even harder.- Game feels very slow. I've kept the game running at x2 most of the time, and x3 when there is nothing else for me to do other than wait for the map to finish.- There isn't really an Options menu besides the Unity options menu that pops up when you boot the game up.- Only 2 music tracks. One for the Menu, the other in game. It gets very repetitive and annoying fast. No options to turn off music, so I had to mute the entire application just so I can have my own music.- No Steam Cards (for the people that care about it, like me xD)In the end it's an ok game, and only spending $1 as a time killer was great. If you like TD games, it's a great game to add to your collection.  I'm not very good at TD games, and did not feel like spending the time to figure out the exact way I was supposed to win each level. Still fun though! ^_^"
76561198073648775,Recommended,308460,12036455,"Posted: 9 September, 2014",all,Suma,"War in a Box: Paper Tanks is a plain vanilla TD game that feels rushed.  It's like the developer had some good ideas that were hard to implement and when he got them working, he didn't do much with them.  Like the tower views.  That is all it is…  One view from a chosen turret.  No shooting or even turning the turret.  It's just a camera view.The game is okay, but it's basic to the point of not really wanting to play it again once you get the 3 stars and 100%.  There are only 5 towers with 3 upgrade levels and 24 small maps.  You can only build towers on predesignated platforms and there are not very many of them scattered throughout the small maps, so you must choose your towers wisely!  Like only 5 - 7!  Once you figure out the correct combonation of towers to use and placement, there is no challenge anymore.  Also, once you place all of your towers and upgrade them, you just sit and watch the battle.  There's nothing left to do...It's also got one bad design choice IMO.  The enemies don't explode or disappear from the track fast enough and this can cause unpredictable problems. Sometimes shots get blocked, making you lose the level and have to restart the mission over from the beginning.  If you are going for 3 stars, you'll need to start over sometimes.  It's not that bad and doesn't happen all the time, but when it does, it's frustrating.Animations are stiff, but the enemy are supposed to be made out of paper, so it fits the game style I guess.  The sounds are okay and fit the game well.  It's not a bad or broken game.  It's just very basic and at times, unpredictable.  Hey it runs in the highest settings on both of my Mac's so I give it a huge plus for that alone! :-)I ""only"" recommend this game to diehard TD fans looking for something new!!!

If you survive that mission there's another different challenge on the next map with 24 total levels in the campaign.On the good side:+ I quite liked the graphics and the style.+ The expected / nice variety of towers, enemies, etc.+ It was entertaining+ Just what I was looking for in a 'toy box' Tower Defense (TD) gameOn the OK side:~ Music / Sound could have been better.~ Nothing outstanding / unique about the game.  More-or-less standard-fare for a TD game~ No benefit to saving your cash (earned by destroying enemies) either in a score at the end of the game, or in ""interest"" of earning cash during the mission by using better placement of the right type of gun.On the down side:- Later missions are fairly ridiculous in their layouts such as very few locations to place a turret, and another where the path is straight across the screen.- Turrets are annoyingly stupid, shooting trees/obstacles repeatedly- The devs have designed the paths to take advantage of this poor turret AI the player must deal with- Few places to put your turrets, so the devs have given you very little choice/variety to still get you a 3-Star victory.Overall:  I really enjoyed my 5.5 hours to complete the campaign against the paper army, but it could have been much better with better maps and a little more polish.  7.5 / 10"

But the levels are balanced for the towers as they are, and you can somewhat compensate by tower placement.There's nothing really original here, just your basic tower defense game, and I wouldn't pay full price for it, but I still liked it, and if you're not totally burned out on tower defense it's worth $5 IMO.  It hasn't crashed once on me, no bugs or gliches that I've seen, and for the most part  the levels are balanced well (level 9 has issues).[Note: this is the same game as Tabletop Defense, apparantly some issue between the devs and the first publisher, but the devs claim they get money when you buy this one and they don't from that one, for whatever that's worth.]"

Sometimes, you are simply not given enough tower spaces. This makes gameplay more difficult as you are forced to shuffle turrets, depending on which enemy is incoming next wave. Contorls are ok, but sometimes tricky. It's definitely easier on tablet with 2 hands, rather than mouse with single pointer. But, it is ok with mouse too.Also, I just have to mention that I found the music very repetitive and kinda annoying. It is a consequence of this being a budget game...Overall, I can only recommend it on sale, due to low replayability. It has no endless modes either, just 24 levels.For a few hours of fun, though, it is ok!"

It gets boring fast though.In summary, do not expect a great challenge or fast paced TD. A good enough time killer."

Getting through the levels is one thing, getting through with a perfect score is another, but can be done after tweaking and many attempts. Graphics are great; overall a fun little game that is addictive as hell. Well worth the full price, a no-brainer on sale."

,Not Recommended,308460,34161291,Posted: 10 August,all,› Happy Camper [NOTACON],"From limited tower placement to limited amount of towers, the only way to win some levels is to figure out the one combination of towers and upgrades that will enable a win condition.  There isn't as much creativity required that other, better, tower defense games need.Not recommended."
