If you're into the pokemon formula then you've got a pretty good idea about what Minimon is trying to accomplish.Except don't bother. This game is terrible.""But the game is early access! You should expect some bumps!"" you might say, and you'd be absolutely right. I've played many early access games and greatly enjoyed them. This one, however, is shockingly bad. The graphics are terrible, the animations are worse, the controls are awkward and disjointed, the sound comes and goes as it pleases, the dialogue reads as if it's been run through google translate, there's no documentation readily available, menus haphazarldy transition or dissappear all together at random, scripted NPC behavior often sends them running to walls or vanishing mid-sentence, there's intense lag (even in single player!), and so on.The whole thing feels like a first attempt at making a game- the sort of thing you'd expect from a high school senior who's still learning the finer points of javascript. Instead it's tucked among other actual games, boasting positive reviews from people I can only assume are friends of the developer. It's a train wreck and everyone's on fire.But really, this should all be excusable. After all, it's early access. Except it's not. It's awful. The game would have to be scrapped and rebuilt from the ground up to be salvagable. The developed expects this game to be finished in roughly 5 months (as of this review) which includes ""player suggestions."" This is basically the game you're getting.Even were it free it wouldn't be worth your time. If you want the pokemon experience on your computer try Pokemon Zeta Omicron, PokeMMO, or even Pokemon Legends. This game doesn't deliver."

I understand it is early access, but the bugs I ran into are just too big. Idk if it is a problem with my own pc, or the servers are recently down, but i can only get into ""Local Server"" and not the ones that should have other people in them.Now the real bugs.1) cannot feed my pets treats2) cannot level up properly. Each time I do, it does not show on my team list, yet does on the monster's, or my info. To fix this I have to exit the game and relog.3) Whenever I try assigning points, either i have ntot enough points because i need 93 points, then it suddenly changes to 200+ points needed, or they do not go up at all.There are more, but these are the major ones. The minor ones I do not mind as they were to be expected. Until these bugs can somehow be fixed, I just cannot play this game, despite really wanting to.."

But the released product is not at all what I had hoped it would be. Like an idiot, I was won over by the mere idea of a Pokemon-esque game on PC, but now I kind of wish I could get a refund. I actually have a personal policy against buying Early Access games, HOWEVER, this one was different because the developer claims that this is the finished product. He released it under Early Access because he said he plans to add more features, but essentially the game as it is now, is what it will always be at its core.And what is it now? A horrid, buggy, laggy mess. I don't even know where to start. The animations are gross, the graphics arenot good, the actual gameplay is pretty bugged, and the UI system is nonintuitive.I really hope thise game does receive an overhaul, but seeing as how this is supposed to be the end product, I wouldn't hold my breath."

The updates seem to be to few and fix even less. I really want this game to be successful and become I decent alternative to Pokemon but at this rate I do not know that it will.

,Recommended,308520,19793963,"Posted: 19 December, 2015",all,Lance,"*Most Recent Review from this is October 24, 2015.Hello to everyone who wish to purchase this game, but have difficulty if they want to. This is the review that you SHOULD read instead of the past reviews. Let's begin...Storyline:Minimon's storyline is very unique from other games that are an innovation of Pokemon because it involves your family, criminals, and the urge to become the best! monster hunter (trainer). The theme can clearly be seen as a mix of good and evil and the importance of family.Rate: 8/10Gameplay Time:Next, the game's storyline is much more time consuming compared to other games. I recently discovered an article stating that for every hour of gameplay there is in a game is $1.00. I currently have at this time 62.3 hours of gameplay, and have not completed the storyline yet (including leveling monsters). It appears that this game produces a large amount of content considering it being in early development.Rate: 10/10Creativity:Surely most of you have seen at least one Pokemon game that was not produced by Game Freak, one of Nintendo's subsidary corperation. It also enables the customer to purchase the game for free. However, this game does not because of it's originality, to a certain extent. The regions are orginal, the 'gym leaders' are orginal, the monsters are orginal, etc...Rate: 5/10Reason: Reminds me of PokemonMinor Details:Too many to explain.Rate: 10/10Bugs:KEEP IN MIND THIS SHOULD NOT INHIBIT YOU FROM BUYING THIS GAME, NOW OR LATER IN THE FUTURE.Yes, I agree there are minor bugs to this game. However, the game is still playable.Rate: Can't rate bugs...ladybug is pretty hot thoughComplaints:More animationsRate: 9/10Personal Experience:I recently stated I have currently played this game for 62.3 hours. I have been playing since June/July and have not regreted purchasing this game. You are capable of playing online or offline, which is the beuty of this game. I have encountered countless bugs, but most, if not all, have been fixed.Rate: 10/10Developer(s):The developer of this game is known as Sushi. He responds to problems or questions that members of the community posts within 24 hours. He is very helpful and wishes the best for the game. If the game contains minor bugs/glitches, he will fix it within that week. If he does not respond, then the co-developer(?) responds helping in any way he can. It appears he wants the best for the game, including Sushi.Rate: 10/10Average Rate: 8.86/10Should you purchase the game? Yes; make sure you limit yourself from playing too much."

,Recommended,308520,20312614,"Posted: 4 January, 2016",all,XADaemonic,"I see-saw on recomending this game:The game is buggy, but has improved immensely since I first bought it. The devs are actively trying to improve on it. It's fun if you like monster catching, and is slowly drifting away from the pokemon clone roots.However, what you pay right now in early access is to beta-test these builds, large feedback for better information for improvements and unless you're wanting to deal with some issues, the game is not worth 10$ right now. I don't really regret buying the game as I get to watch it develop, but that's not for everyone.Things I would like that I haven't discovered and may not exist:An ability to hide my helm so I can have my pretty hair backNicknaming monstersBeing able to register my fishing pole again. that option vanished =("
,Not Recommended,308520,26279015,"Posted: 28 October, 2016",all,ZapTundra,"This game is still unfortunately the same way it was like a year ago.. The developers no matter how much profit they have possibly made off of this from people who were/are loyal players and from others who tried to remain loyal players they really haven't done much updating for it and the last update they did they took away the whole class system for your trainer it was pretty cool but I feel like the developer didn't think that they could hack it, gave up on it, and reverted back to just normal tamers with no special set of skills or anything and ever since then the game has been more jacked up than it has ever really been and has since then not been fixed or patched or anything. Basically if you pay for this game you are getting what you paid for.  I was hoping for it to be more update on the PC and be more up to date but I was dead wrong on that one.   Save your money and look for something else."

I could move my guy on the upper left map, however I couldn't see anything on the main gameboard. The entire screen is bright pink and renders the game completely unplayable. I tried restarting the game and creating new profiles under ""new game"" offline. Nothing fixed the problem. I tried deleting the game and downloading it again.So basically 10 dollars wasted."
