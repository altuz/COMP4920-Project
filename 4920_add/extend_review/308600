76561198038340115,Recommended,308600,31921036,Posted: 23 May,all,caringtadpole,"This is the best top-down shooter I have ever played.I have been playing this game since 2009 in the beta and have over 100 hours logged, and am so glad the dev finally released it on Steam. Ignore the Early Access warning, this game has been polished for years. I personally have suggested many of the features in the game right now, and have been very heavily involved in the balancing discussions as well. If you kill someone with Plasma Ball you can thank ME for asking the dev to buff it! Anyway go get this game.Perfect 5/7 with rice."
,Recommended,308600,31923054,Posted: 23 May,all,Bangerz,Great game. Extremely dedicated developer.
,Recommended,308600,31928248,Posted: 23 May,all,STM1993,"I played back in July 2009 when it was called Subvein/Mutant Factions, and I'm a forum moderator.If you're looking for atopdown shooter inspired by GTA2 with a variety of weapons/spells/skills to pick & make a build for, then I would highly recommend this game. While the game has singleplayer (which is really a glorified tutorial, but worth playing nevertheless), multiplayer is the main focus of the game. Multiplayer combat is quick & decisive, though one-shot kills are pretty rare & situational, and so its more focused on clever positioning & skill usage rather than raw run & gun ability. Multiplayer matches generally last anywhere between 30min to 1 hour, while the singleplayer can last about 4 hours for your first playthrough, with replay value in unlocking higher difficulties & getting a better speedrun record.Speaking from my experience as a player in Singapore connecting to USA or Europe, the game remains veryplayable even in 300 ping lag.I find that themain learning curve is knowing what skills to use or pick in a given situation- once you get past that you can pretty much do anything, and its fortunately pretty easy to figure out with the in-game descriptions. Don't worry about permanently screwing up your character's build - servers are usually set to Quickmatch (all players are reset to level 5). If you bought the game, you do have permanent mutants you can use on Permanent servers, but you can easily reset your build at no cost as long as you're under level 20 (max level is 50 for context), and even past that it only costs you an hour of gameplay for every skillpoint you wish to put elsewhere.Seeing as the game is in early access, I can assure you that thesole developerhas put his heart & soul into polishing the game for the past 8 years and won't be abandoning it anytime soon. He is very receptive to community feedback; in fact the idea of zombies and a singleplayer campaign came from the regular player community. There won't be any pay to win nonsense and he would recommend that you try to free demo to make sure it clicks for you before you buy the game.Overall, a fun indie game with a dedicated developer and plenty of decent content & solid gameplay!"
76561198076460549,Recommended,308600,31924288,Posted: 23 May,all,Grinsford,Played the demo and loved it and now I'm loving the full version! Top-down shooter meets zombies meets skill-tree upgrades. Great multiplayer!
,Recommended,308600,31927274,Posted: 23 May,all,aLt,"Pretty cool. I have played most top-down shooters on steam, the fact the developer went through so much to make his game over 8 years kinda gives a special plus. I haven't even touched the multiplayer but still had lots of fun."
,Recommended,308600,31925847,Posted: 23 May,all,The Gelatinous Overlord,"Because this game is still considered early access (Although it's a solid game), I'm going to preface this by saying that I've been following the development of this game for a little over 6 years and the progress that has happened in the past few years has been enormous, the sole developer tries his best to be active in the community and actually listens to the players. As a matter of fact, the Zombie Survival gamemode and Stealth gamemodes were actually suggested by normal players on the forums, and the developer worked his hardest to get those gamemodes into the game. He put his heart and soul into this fantastic indie game and wont be abandoning it anytime soon.If you're looking for a fast paced top down multiplayer shooter, then Geneshift is the game for you. There's such a wide variety of weapons and skills so every playstyle has a way of expressing itself.Want to be a sneaky assassin?Use Invisibility to sneak up behind someone before blinding them with Smoke Bomb and slicing them up with Blade Fury.Want to be rambo?Rev up your minigun with Frenzy Fire and your foes will cower behind cover in fear. With Bloody gains, you'll get stronger with each kill!Want to be a sniper?With long ranged Plasmaballs you'll blow the enemy apart, and pick the runners off with your Energized rifle.The actual gameplay is fantastic. Allies and Enemies casting skills and doing drivebys with vehicles makes multiplayer hectic fun. It's got a nice playgroundy feel to it, as you can expirement various combinations of weapons and skills, or even just drive around and jump ramps.It's got a wide selection of gamemodes, such as:The standard Deathmatch where you run and gun everything that moves.The classic Extraction where you you have to escort Flags, Radios, and even Bomb trucks to their destination.The fast paced Checkpoint gamemode where you do drivebys in an attempt to stop the enemy racer while your own driver tries to speed to the finish line.The exciting Conquest gamemode where you work with your team to capture chemical points and prevent your foes from doing the same.The stressful Zombie Survival gamemode where you activate bombs and stop an outbreak as zombies pour in on you from all sides.Overall, it's a solid indie game with a fantastic community and developer. It's got plenty of fun content, and minimal bugs."
76561198051084556,Recommended,308600,31924366,Posted: 23 May,all,HardPenguin,"I played Geneshift back in the days, when it had a different name: Subvein (and then, Mutant Factions), since it was in development for few years already. Nonetheless, even then it was a lot of fun! Imagine the good old GTA2, Counter Strike 2D and Diablo skill tree system combined together. As crazy as it sounds, it's a recipe for an action packed multiplayer gameplay, that requires skill and teamwork in order to win! Top-down shootings, explosions, driving and spellcasting is an extremely entertaining mix! The game features various multiplayer combat gamemodes as well as a singleplayer or coop campaign. Definitely give it a go!"

,Recommended,308600,31926155,Posted: 23 May,all,Sophos,"This is an amazing game made by an amazing developer. A friendly guy with a good heart and a real passion for making quality games. He genuinely cares about the community that formed around this game since it's initial release in 2009, and has never stopped engaging positively with everyone involved. His passion has really shone through in how he interacts with his dedicated players and in the artistry of his game. Please give this breakout work of art a chance and please support this awesome developer!-Avid player since 2009"
,Recommended,308600,31924039,Posted: 23 May,all,niet3sche77,"As an early-access game, this is solidly-impressive. Even as a 1.0, this is solidly-impressive.The only immediate faults I find come in the form of feature-requests: joystick support, and local multiplayer.As a technical accomplishment, the game appears absolutely solid in what I've seen (feature-request aside). Insofar as story-arc, it's a good one and can lead down a lot of roads, all of which make for good shooter-with-moral-elements-lurking-in-the-shadows gameplay.I enjoyed the hour that I've spent thus far, and will spend many more hours here--especially if I can un-tether from my PC and move to a television via joystick control / Steam Big Screen support.TL;DR: pick this one up. It's a solid buy at the $9.99 mark.I am looking forward to 1.0 and the success of Nik Nak Studios!"

I have not played much yet, but it is a great title so far.  I like the style and what looks like the heart that has gone into it."
,Recommended,308600,32042450,Posted: 29 May,all,Sesser,"So I haven't played too much yet as the multiplayer runs off of direct connections (understandably!) for the campaign, and my buddy and I want to coop the campaign. However, I did solo the first level and my impressions are that this is a very smooth and competently put together game. A good bit of time was put into it to make it run well and run predictably. I enjoy the gunplay, and the humor that is in the game. I was on a normal difficulty and I did die a couple of times, which bodes well for the game. Furthermore, the price is appropriate for what it is doing.Overall, recommended!"
,Recommended,308600,31931149,Posted: 24 May,all,Eterno,Quite decent top down shooter for an early access game. Reminds of good old days when played GTA 1; GTA 2 games. IT also has RPG elements implemented in and working multiplayer with coop and few extra game modes. Best of all its really cheap game. You can't go wrong with this bargain.I made first impressions of Geneshift.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW873ECF9Hk&t
76561197960756061,Recommended,308600,31923423,Posted: 23 May,all,Pleks,Cool top down shooter with a lot of content! Brings back the good old days playing GTA at LAN even though this is more of a shooter then a car game.
,Recommended,308600,31941780,Posted: 24 May,all,CPT ERECTILE,"With great gameplay mechanics and a truly uniqe skill tree that allows you to truly be your own unique lethal weapon.  Without a doubt this game brings some nice fast paced tactical fun!My favorite highlights:Topdown viewing perspective isnt limited to just your box, snipers for example allow you to look further onward unlike games like CS2D!Cars! you can drive around with some friends doing drive bys! my personal favorite is the pick-up truck where someone can be in the bed and shoot in any direction!Skills, the combinations are endless when it comes to this games skill trees! you can stay dedicated to one, or mix it up for a personally unique playing stylesBuilt in editor allows for plenty of user generated content!Low sys requirments, High amount of fun!Friendly community, aswell as a dev that actually listens to players and is dedicated!I would for sure recommend this game to a friend! 10/10 in my book for an amazing top down shooter"

A really neat little game.Just did a few multiplayer games and had tons of fun. You can even create your own maps, but I haven't gotten to that yet.I'll be playing the campaign now, to see how that goes - but multiplayer will be my main outlet anyway. Superb!"
,Recommended,308600,31942345,Posted: 24 May,all,dяαкz ;3,"This is an amazing game which can make top-down games better by giving the infinite amount of things to do - like giving us the jumping ability, the explosions, the powers, the cars and other experiences, rather than having a completely 2D slim game. It's a good mixing of GTA1/2 and shooting games.I recommend it."

Top-down shooter with some great combat mechanics. Even if I won't play the game much, I'm glad I bought it to support the developer."

,Recommended,308600,31982579,Posted: 26 May,all,Morally Bankrupt,"I'll be honest, after reading the reviews, I thought ""Sure, why not, it's $7"" and when I first started I had a thought that I wouldn't like it.  Well after playing 3 hours straight I realized that I really enjoy this game.  I actually found myself wanting to come back and play.There are enough mechanics to keep it interesting and varied.  The multiplayer seems to go in waves, sometimes it's full of people and other times it's dead...and it depends on the time of day from what I noticed.This will be the first weekend coming up for it, so I hope a lot of people jump on - I will.It's got the driving mechanics of old school GTA or 'Zombie Driver HD' + twin stick shooterness of 'Running w/ Rifles'."

,Recommended,308600,32052144,Posted: 29 May,all,Robvinsky,"I haven't played this game very much but I like it quite a bit already. The multiplayer gets pretty intesnse with a lot of pretty cool weapons. Where yo point your cursor also plays a role in aiming,  so if you're trying to shoot a guy on top of a building you can't just point at the groung in front of it. The driving is pretty smooth. The mutant abilities are really useful, withouth them this game would be like Hotline Miami. The campaign is fun, it has a sense of humor and it's a good way to figure out how to play the game. If you don't want to learn the game through a campaign there's newbie servers that do a great job with explaining the game too."
,Recommended,308600,31990210,Posted: 27 May,all,sagman101,"I love this game, I know a lot of people are comparing this to GTA 2 or Counter Strike however there is enough new ideas in this game to call it unique. 4-5 houir story campaign plus multiple multiplayer modes.Would definitely recommended."

It can a similar feel to the good old GTA days when you could run people over with cars and run around shooting that bad guys... Except this one is a multi-player, which I always prefer. With mutant-zombies! I also really like the wide variety of weapons, and how you can unlock new abilities. I definitely recommend!"

Generally, I don't recommend most games in early access. However, this game has more than enough content to justify the price at this point.VERY CRISP"
,Recommended,308600,31925942,Posted: 23 May,all,lockk,"I will update this review over time.I like it, i like the premise, but there is some issues.I was kind of surprised when there wasnt controller support, this would make something like co-op a lot more fun if you had friends over. The graphics, oh god, it looks like this game was made from roblox models, not a HUGE issue but something that should be addressed. So far though, so good, its pretty fun. The controls with KB+M are surprisingly tight and fun to use, the moderatly fast paced combat is pretty fun and I could see this game getting pretty big if continuely updated."

Mental.Could use some improvements - like perhaps a ""Crouch"" perspective view gives you a better sight ability. Also the UI/UX could use some polishing.Other than that though, hell of a lot of fun!!! Highly bloody recommend."
