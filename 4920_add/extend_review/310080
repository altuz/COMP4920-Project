This has ruffled a lot of feathers, and with good reason, as there are some real birdbrains making videogames nowadays. But I'm talon you, this isn't one of those, this game is eggcellent. You might fink people just buy it for ironic purposes, but it's eggshelly a very good game. The premise may make you worried that the game's a bit of an odd duck - a human gull going to a school for birds? To call that ""realistic"" would be ostrich, so a lot of peeps might wonder how the flock that can make for a fun game. But if you give it a chance and carrion with it, you'll discover that it is well written, with a migrate cast of characters. You're bound to have a pheasant time with this, and even if you're still hesitant, you should swallow your pride and buy the game on a lark (it's not that expensive, so don't worry about the bill), and you'll discover an impeckable game with hours of replay value. So just spend some cash from your nest egg, and from heron out you won't egret your perchase. You'll have a hoot, guaranteed."

I wasn't expecting anything more than a joke game that would be good for a few laughs but, Hatoful Boyfriend is so much more than that.

,Recommended,310080,15994503,"Posted: 25 May, 2015",all,Welokay,"I share a similar story with many other reviewers here. I bought this game for the laughs. I mean, a pigeon dating sim? I assumed I'd have fun with it for a couple of hours and then be done. I was not expecting what happened next.ConsI must admit that there are negatives, and I will point them out before I praise the game. To start off, I'm not sure if this can be considered a negative (I think it's a positive), but a few of the story lines seem to be created merely for amusement and humour. They make no sense, and are there as a joke. However, If you are looking for something that is 100% serious, you're in the wrong place, and I have absolutely no clue why you would be here in the first place. Anyway, the interface and skill point system is simple, but they do the job. There are a few spelling and grammar errors scattered throughout, which may be distracting, but they are far and few between. As well, the starting routes are short and perhaps shallow. I recommend you try to complete all of the endings in order to see the ""Bad Boys Love"" bonus ending and the epilogue.ProsDespite all of that, this game sets you on an emotional roller coaster if you put in the time to explore the different routes, and carry through with the finale. With various endings, each path provides a unique narrative. If the final ending is achieved, all of the stories tie together quite well, leaving you with an unexpectedly profound story, a group of memorable characters, and a collection of bird puns.I came for the laughs. What I got was comedy, romance, horror, mystery, and tears.I didn't ask for this.But I'm glad it happened."
,Recommended,310080,18172026,"Posted: 24 September, 2015",all,Faudraline,"What does ""Hatoful"" even mean?...WARNING: CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!Hatoful -hatofuru- is a word pun between the Japanese wordhato- which means either dove, or pigeon - and the English adjectives of eitherHeartfulorHurtful. On these terms, the title of the game is self-explanatory.Hatoful Boyfriendis a humorous otome/visual novel in which you get to date birds. Aside the humorous, or even strikingly unconventional nature of the game, this joke veils a deeper truth.The story is set in the fictional future of 2188. A century ago starting with rock pigeons, birds all over the world started to take the next step in evolution and challenged the omnipotence of mankind. After a long period of conflict and even open war, the mankind survived only as a minority. Now, the majority of the world's conscient population consists of birds. In this particular dystopia, we take the role of the only human student invited to attend St. Pigeonation, the most prestigious high school for birds of the world.At first, the display of the story keeps us oblivious to the grim face of our setting. Nothing indicates thatHatoful Boyfriendwould be more than an unimaginably crazy joke. We keep playing the game in this meaningless context, as a silly joke, flirting with different kinds of birds and all. We laugh our hearts out for the absurdity of given situations, the reactions and portrayals of characters, and logical flaws of the setting are unbearably funny. It is like watching one of the most absurd anime series, like ever!But as the stories progress, and we accomplish different kinds of romances, we learn a bit more about different characters each time. As we play, they become more than silly depictions of birds. We learn their stories, their backgrounds, their aspirations and their wounds... just like real people. I tell you, the narrative of this game, and the narrative's ability to conceal the most shocking fictional events in silly jokes are totally scary. As we play, bits and pieces roll up to their proper places to paint an incredibly political and ethical discussion with suspense and immense tragedy!Gameplay wise, nothing is extraordinary. There are some pretty background pictures, and an incredible amount of bird photos flying around. Each character has their own separate background music. You start reading, and make some dialogue or event choices now and then. Finally, it wraps up to become a romance path for a bird of your choice. When you complete all endings, and start a new game; you face with the question whether you'd like to keep a long forgotten promise. If you say yes, things take an incredible turn, to reveal all past mysteries. Annoying or peculiar occurrences that you've been witnessing in your prior games now form a painful meaning. This final storyline reveals a darker side to our fictional setting, and brings question to concepts such as war, peace, misinformation, discrimination, racial and ethnic differences, and even biological war! Now, that was certainly unexpected, wasn't it?Hatoful Boyfriendstarts as an absurd joke for you to kill some meaningless time, yet if you bear with its lame display and take a moment to look deeper, it rewards you with a most thrilling and disturbingly realistic story. Take your time, get bored by the joke. You'll end up picking a glass of water to wash the bitter feeling in your throat towards the end.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

You can identify a parakeet's gender by their little nose above their beak. If it is dark blue or purple, it is a boy and if it is light tan or pink, it is a girl.

,Not Recommended,310080,12812827,"Posted: 5 November, 2014",all,sammwich,"I appear to be the first negative reviewer to have completed the game in its entirety.  This game has two distinct parts, the dating sim and the Bad Boys Love secret route unlocked by romancing every bird possible.The first part is simply too short to be entertaining.  Any route can be read in about an hour going at a relaxed pace, but there is significant overlap between routes, including sections that have no effect on the particular route you're playing, so I found myself skipping more and more as I replayed.  This also caused me to inadvertantly skip content I hadn't read before, because some sections have multiple outcomes but start out the same way regardless of route.  There is no way to go back to content accidentally skipped without reloading or starting a new game and it simply wasn't interesting enough to worth bothering to find out why I was faced with the choice of telling Okosan ""convenience store"" or ""grocery store"" and I could infer it had something to do with pudding anyway.Consequently, there just isn't enough time to give any character depth and there's no challenge to complete a route.  By the time you finish a route, you feel like you were merely introduced to the character.  Picking routes are also very obvious and there is never any difficulty in seducing the various birds, unless you can't figure out that picking every opportunity to spend time with your desired bird is necessary to romance them.  The routes I enjoyed most, Okosan, Shuu, and Anghel, stood out because they were simply the most oddball.  For a game that is billed as a comedy, most routes utilize stereotypical melodrama.  Bird puns and pop culture references abound, but there's really nothing laugh out loud funny in Hatoful Boyfriend and at best you'll smirk a lot.There is a very simple stat system, raised by choosing between three elective classes at regular intervals and in a couple of events that likewise present three choices which raise a stat.  The stats serve one purpose, which is to determine whether you get a normal ending or an extended ending.  Extended endings require you to raise one stat to maximum and reward you with an extra scene that was implied in the normal ending anyway.  Each ending has a separate achievement and you can't get both the normal ending and extended ending achievements in one go, so you have to play the same route twice in order to get all the achievements and unlock the Bad Boys Love extended ending.  I wasted part of my life to get the BBL extended ending and it was just as disappointing as the other extended endings.The second part of the game, the Bad Boys Love secret route is much more interesting, but by the time I unlocked it I was already tired of the game.  I trudged on in hopes that it would be good and it was, kind of.  The game suddenly takes a much darker tone, reveals how the world came to be dominated by talking birds, and becomes a mystery story.  It seems interesting for a while, but as all the threads come together it becomes a soap opera for the ages.  Characters are revealed to be secret brothers, secret childhood friends, secret enemies, secret agents, secret terrorists, secret weapons, secretly superpowered, secretly alive, but, alas, there are no secret comas to complete the cliche pantheon.  I got the distinct impression that the first half of the game was written primarily to introduce the characters so that the meandering mysteries wouldn't simply baffle readers.All in all, Hatoful Boyfriend wasn't an altogether terrible game, but it just wasn't worth the money and I got it in a 50% off sale.  I will likely never read it again and would forget about it entirely if Steam didn't keep it in my library forever.  As some consolation, the trading cards were surprisingly valuable and I was able to quickly sell them for about $1.50.If you don't mind a lot of repetition, love every visual novel no matter what, and really love silly gimmicks, then buy this game.  Otherwise, pick up just about any other visual novel on Steam.  Even some of the free ones are more entertaining than Hatoful Boyfriend.4/10"

Just listen, I'm going somewhere with this okay? *sigh* Okay, without further ado, I present to you...LASTING IMPRESSIONSHatoful BoyfriendGENREDating Simulator/Visual NovelSTORYIn Hatoful Boyfriend you take the role of Hiyoko Tosaka, a human going to a prestigious highschool for birds. The school in question is St. Pigeonation’s, and it's known mostly for being the world's greatest gathering place for birds. You're a sophomore now, but you haven't done much to adjust to the atmosphere of Pigeonation's just yet. You're not entirely lost though, as you also have one of the several woo-able birds with you, your hardworking best friend Ryouta Kawara. Along with him you can also bond with narcoleptic math teacher Nanaki Kazuaki, bashful aristocrat Sakuya Le Bel Shirogane, distant bookworm Fujishiro Nageki, suave ladies' man Sakazaki Yuuya, enigmatic doctor Iwamine Shuu, and hyperactive track star Okosan. With so much romance in the air, it's hard to believe the school holds so many dark secrets...GAMEPLAYEver read a book online? It's like that except every once in a while the books asks which choice you want to make. The choices you make will determine which bird you end up with, along with which ending you get for them. [Provided you don't get indesicive and go the way of the dodo, of course.] Each day you will be asked which class you want to take; this decides which trait will be leveled for that day. As previously mentioned, this will affect which ending you get for your desired bird.VISUALSNot much to say. It's pictures of birds with various backgrounds. The backgrounds look very nice, and there's quite a large amount of them. You also get a little end card pictures for your gallery after the end of each route. They're gosh darned cute.SOUNDTRACKThe soundtrack is a delightful mix of royalty-free, classics, and original [I think?] tracks. All of them fit perfectly with any of the situations at hand. [Except maybe when Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy plays, that's always just plain silly.] There's many tracks from Kevin MacLoed and SENTIVE; the sexy, suave Dispersion Relation, Simply Blue, Daybreak [Personal favorite.], and tons of ones with gibberish for names. The collector's edition is worth is just for the beautiful OST.SEQUELS [SPOILERS]Hatoful Boyfriend is the quintessential example of an idea that I've had for a while now; some games should never get sequels. While it's obvious that a bad game shouldn't deserve a sequel; I'm of the opinion that if a game is GOOD enough it shouldn't HAVE a sequel. If a game does all that it wishes, if a game provides a fulfilling, complete experience; it would be insulting to continue where the game left off. You may be thinking 'How does a game about dating birds provide a fulfilling experience?' I'll tell you; it's because the entire dating sim portion of the game is a mere facade. Once you've completed all possible routes at least once, you have the option to unlock BBL; a grim narrative that reveals the lore behind this game's world, the motivations and sins of characters, and completes all story arcs. The dating sim part of Hatoful Boyfriend is there simply to set up characters so that you know who this story is centered around. You know how they act by then, what their situations are, and this only helps to greatly strengthen the story. It's a fantastic conclusion, and it's one that left me speechless. Which brings us back to sequels. As I've said, a sequel to this game woud be a downright insult; a direct sequel that is. A direct sequel would be insulting, as the game would have nowhere to go with the current story; all arcs are completed. However, an indirect sequel would be a very, very smart idea if done correctly. By merely taking the characters we know and love and putting them in a different kind of story; the game has somewhere to go. Oh, and it did go somwhere, as an indirect sequel exists. [Holiday Star is its name if you were wondering. Not yet on steam though.]FINAL THOUGHTSI dove this game. To say that this was a pheasant experience would be the understatement of the century. While at first glance, it may look like quite the bad egg, it's surely a narrative you'll never forget. I'm talon you, it's all here! Great soundtrack, amazing characters, bird puns; it's just a quail of a time! The price ain't nothin to go squawkin' about neither, no need to worry about some ludicrous bill. This is the defenition of the phrase 'more than meets the eye' and you'd have to be some hard boiled individual not to enjoy the humor at the least. I know I'm gushing, but I just can't recommend this enough! While you're at it, make sure to kill two birds with one stone and buy the collector's edition with it. The soundtrack alone makes it worth it. Alright, I've egged you on for far too much now, I'll sparrow you of any more. Hatoful Boyfriend has left a resounding lasting impression; it's not what the source material is, it's what you do with it that makes it a golden goose egg. You've got your ducks in a row MediaTonic, keep it up.And now, in Japanese tradition, a haiku.Hatoful Boyfriend,A dating sim about birds.I was not prepared."

The characters are ACTUALLY birds, and you are ACTUALLY a human going to a Japanese bird school. This isn't played for laughs in the writing, even during the normal routes.There's no ""good end bad end"" endings but ""non-canon"" endings where, quite simply, you survive and successfully romance a bird (Except a few endings but you'll find those if you play).The BBL (Bad Boys Love): Hurtful Boyfriend ending unlocks when you've received all fourteen endings. BBL tells the canon story of the Hatoful world, explaining WHY you, Hiyoko Tosaka, are a human coexisting with highly evolved birds.It's a long convoluted story, taking approximately four hours to complete. The BBL ending plays like a normal route until about halfway through the school year, when Hiyoko is murdered.Sh*t hits the fan, and you don't have choices like a normal route. The game turns into a visual novel, only requiring you to click along to continue the dialogue and reveal the story.I think Hatoful's only real flaw (besides some typos, notably in Nageki's BBL ending) is the monotony if you're trying to unlock all the endings at once. Luckily there's a fast forward button.This is a good story. The Planet of the Apes scenario works well, and you become less concerned that this school is for birds, and more interested in the characters and why things have been a little weird this whole time. It takes dating game tropes and turns them into its own.Hatoful completely flips the direction of typical dating games, to tell a good story, and remains self-aware the whole time.I really like this game and encourage people who enjoy strong writing to play it. 10/10.

It's a treasure with a surprising amount of (dark) meat hidden beneath its little avian heart.You will get attached to the pidgeons. Even if they are popular otome game stereotypes, each one ends up having tons of heart.

Still, there's something for everyone, with some of the routes becoming surprisingy poignant.The translation, despite a few typos, is delightful, and the writing was very clearly done with love. Even if the art is quite literally stock photos of birds, don't let that dissaude you: It's actually a very well-made game.The special route, the ""Bad Boys' Love"" Route, also deserves a mention, as it elevates the game from ""fun gimmick"" to ""wow this is actually really well-done"".And for those who want more of the fun (and pain), the Christmas sequel, ""Holiday Star"", is a nice addition to the franchise.

This game is seriously by far one of the most rollercoaster-y experiences I've ever had.I'll admit, I bought this game because I thought it was a joke of a game; you start off by dating a menagerie of birds, all with differing personalities and different endings. Some are pure humor, others are tinged with sadness, and still others will make you question what the hell you just played (and even then, there's two ways you could go with this). I had some knowledge of the backstory beforehand, but I wasn't prepared for what came next.The endgame takes the main game's rollercoaster of feels and turns it up to 11. Once a happy, satirical dating simulator, the game shifts to a murder mystery with one simple stroke. Over three hours worth of dialogue to digest, and over three hours of sheer emotional WTF; springboarding from utter despair to stifling a giggle at Okosan's antics is a bit jarring, but the game pulls it off rather well.And the true ending?If people take this review seriously and get the game, I just gotta say that it is by far one of the most touching endings I've experienced.If nothing else, this game should be playedJUSTbecause of the endgame. The main game is a comedic and incredibly well-constructed setup to a tragic, emotionally charged ending that's satisfying in its own way. I completely, 100 percent recommend Hatoful Boyfriend as a game that everyone should experience in their life, as soon as possible.ps yuuya best birb"

Like how Birdemic has 10/10 ratings on imdb saying the film brought family members back to life.Buy holy crap, what to say about this game? I've never played anything like it. This flips the genre of dating sims on its head and makes the player expect it to be one thing, then turn out to be the exact opposite. What begins as a silly dating sim featuring birds to mix up the formula becomes a horror mystery visual novel in later playthroughs. The first ten endings you get serve to build up the world and characters while introducing small bits of a greater theme, but it is once you get ten endings that the game decides to give the player a new option for how to play the game. Do yourself a favor and choose that option.Thi is a legitimately great experience. It's humorous, insane, and in some character's routes, absolutely grand. Who is the political traitor? Are there murders or simply devious tricks all meant to confuse certain characters? And why are you, a human, attending a school for birds?The only possible complaints I can think of are that it can get incredibly text-heavy with little player input for decently long stretches at a time, and there are the occasional terrible grammatical or spelling errors that can confuse an entire sentence. You can save whenever at the click of a button, so time shouldn't discourage you from playing this. Please play this so long as you have any interest at all. It honestly won't disappoint....Seriously, how many dating sims have RPG combat? That's telling of this game's creativity.

76561198112059304,Recommended,310080,12019170,"Posted: 7 September, 2014",all,Pannacone,"Let's be honest: we all buy Hatoful Boyfriend for the sheer absurdity of what is, at its core, a visual novel pigeon dating game. And, on its surface at least, Hatoful Boyfriend is a shallow dating sim where the human main character is enrolled at St. PigeoNation's, a school for pigeons. She takes classes, she goes to festivals, and she romances and falls in love with various species of birds. However, Hatoful Boyfriend's stereotypical high school romance exterior is only an entertaining and light-hearted charade that covers up a plot full of politics, intrigue, mystery, and sorrow.The first half of Hatoful Boyfriend is quirky and humorous, filled with various pop culture jokes and absurd situations. Players find themselves romancing one of several standard character archetypes: the childhood best friend, the lazy professor, the haughty aristocrat, the womanizing jock, the bullied library nerd, and so on. The scenarios are cute and heart-warming, with each character having their own separate little storyline. Every short playthrough of the game—which frequently take under an hour even if you read all of the text—ends with a primarily sappy romantic ending.As players go through multiple playthroughs of Hatoful Boyfriend, however, a more insidious underlying plot is slowly revealed. Every romantic plot line will unveil more pieces of St. PigeoNation's dark history and the tragic cast of characters that attend classes there. These pieces on their own add spice to an otherwise bland dating sim that seems to cash in on its unique and somewhat ridiculous premise of a human girl dating pigeons. And, if one were to stop playing Hatoful Boyfriend after only a couple of playthroughs, that would be the feeling that one would be left with: Hatoful Boyfriend is an amusing dating game to spend an afternoon on, but nothing remarkable.However, players that choose to stop playing Hatoful Boyfriend after only a few short playthroughs are missing out on the part of Hatoful Boyfriend that makes it an excellent game. If the first thirteen playthroughs of Hatoful Boyfriend are an amusing way to pass an afternoon, then the last playthrough is a gut-wrenching ride through a twisting plot that ties together everything the player has done up to that point. The short of it is this: this isn't just a game that you should play, it's a game that you should strive to complete 100% of the way."

And if you don't think you're up to it, you haven't played this masterpiece yet. This isn't just a game. It's a journey. A life-changing experience. Prepare to have your eyes opened to the truth.Hatoful Boyfriend actually falls under the category of visual novel, as it's a Japanese otome game. Otome is Japanese for sausage fest. You're playing a girl getting aggressively humped by every guy in the immediate vicinity. Which, in this case, are all birds. And you get to make the exciting choices that will determine not only who's eggs you'll be laying, but the fate of the world as we know it.Hatoful Boyfriend was originally developed for the PC in 2011, later seeing multiple rereleases and upgrades before getting an HD remaster that released on Steam, PS4, and PS Vita.Hatoful Boyfriend is, simply by existing, worth checking out. No where else can you experience the excitement of being the only human girl at an all-birds high school. It's the only of its kind, and simply the premise itself should warrant at least a single playthrough.Not only is it relevant simply because of its premise, but it also works rather well simply on its premise alone. If you're picking it up simply because ""LOOK, BIRDS"" you'll get exactly what you're looking for. It's wacky, zany, kooky bird fun. Good stuff.But underneath that simple premise, a surprising amount of depth is layered. Spoiler alert, dating birds at an all-birds school is not something people usually do. Usually. It's not quite a mainstream way of life yet, but we're rallying for our lifestyle to be recognized by the masses. Someday, human-bird relationships might be accepted. Birds don't even have access to public schooling yet, so we have a ways to go.Shockingly, Hatoful Boyfriend is a parody dating sim. A joke game of sorts, satirizing the otome genre. All of the cliches, all of the character stereotypes, they're all here. You can expect all of basics to be here. Maid costumes and all. It's tasteful satire, not in an overbearing ""LOOK GUYS WE'RE MAKING JOKES HERE"" kind of way. The writing is hilarious, and carries a sort of ironic whimsy to it. It's fully aware of its nature, but runs with it regardless. It is a visual novel, which means reading, which means no this is not an action game or anything vigorous like that. Unless you wanna dip your little parakeet perch in honey and bird seed so you can stick it through the bars of grandma's lovebird cage while you play. Those HD character portraits are pretty feathery.It's not only poking fun at otome visual novels, it's in fact written well enough to be a competent example of the genre that it's making a mockery of. The characters are interesting and compelling in their own right, even if they are just caricatures of otome stereotypes given bird form. They're fleshed out with a surprising amount of detail, given that the nature of the game didn't require much to begin with. Just ""look, they're birds that you can date, this one is the jock bird and this one is the nerd bird"" would have sold just as well.If you happen to fall in love with the excellently written birds and words, a lot is in store for you. They've done a beyond fantastic job of rewarding the player for dedication. As a dating sim should, there are multiple endings. At least one for each character, and sometimes two. One ""true ending"" should you flawlessly woo them, and the just okay ending. Where you confess your love and they say ""thanks"". Going the extra mile for more endings will reward you by unlocking even more endings. Better endings.And should you stick around long enough for every single ending, you will be generously rewarded with the best part of the game. There's a lot of tough choices to make, but if you make them all it will be so worth it.Fantastic writing, characters, atmosphere, and a stunning amount of depth and meaning really make Hatoful stand out among other visual novel games. But it's not without issues, though they're more to blame of the genre itself than anything else.After you've played through the game for the first time, regardless of which bird you hope to woo, much of the game remains the same. You'll be going to the same classes, seeing a lot of similar dialogue, and riding the fast-forward text button a ton. That's the biggest flaw with the game.The other being, as I mentioned, the game rewarding people that stick through the game until the very end. Because it's a really big reward. Like, possibly the size of the rest of the game itself in its entirety. I can totally understand why they did it, because the reward itself doesn't carry quite the same impact and meaning until you've played through every ending. It's a steep hill to climb, with a pay-off to match.To go any further would spoil just how perfect the ending is, but it stays true to its absurdity all the way to the end. It honestly blew me away how much depth they put into it. It's really not a one-trick pigeon, as it might lead you to believe.People might dismiss it as ""that weird bird game"" or ""creepy Japanese♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; or ""memes"". They might play it purely for the ""look at me lol I'm so random"" factor, or the jack off to those luscious, feathery bodies. But you realize you're dismissing, stereotyping, and fetishizing a way of life. There's more to it than that. There's depth here. We're more than a stereotype, and I'm tired of needing to hide who I am.Educate yourself, open your mind, and accept that some people have a different lifestyle than you. Some people want to have a nice family with kids in a suburban house. They want that white picket fence life. And some people, they really like birds. Not that there's anything wrong with that. And if you think there is, I think you need to check your privilege. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥."

I've played a couple other dating sims before, but I've definitely enjoyed this one most of all. The routes aren't cliche, and present items to the story rather than gooey love plots. I reccommend playing all of the routes, and then playing the extra route (also play all the routes first, or else you'll have to play bbl again to get the special ending, and bbl is rather lengthy.)

In fact, it has surpassed, to me, the likes of Undertale, Borderlands, and my previous favourite game in existence (Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky, which I would absolutely recommend you try via emulator if you haven't played it already), to reign supreme above them all, now sitting in my second-favourite spot overall as of August 2017.Why?Well, I'm glad you asked. That's what this ""Review"" feature on Steam is for. It's a really handy little thing.TL;DR ReviewSo, first off, the short version for all of you who'd like to get a general consensus on my feelings about this game and why you should have bought it already, and then bought it for a friend or seven immediately afterwards, and for those who want to avoid knowing much about it. Trust me, you really do want to go into this game knowing as little as possible.Hatoful Boyfriend is a dating simulation game about birds. Pigeons, to be exact. It has you play the only human girl in a school full of the things, and it's your job to get one of them to like you enough to have beautiful, mutated half-bird/half-human hybrid children a couple years down the line with.Of course, you've got a wide selection to choose from. You have your typical tropes that can be found in most of these sort of visual novel-style games, such as the ""best friend"" character and the character who thinks they're above everyone else, but there's also some more varied personalities, including a creepy doctor and someone who thinks they live in a JRPG.If you're a fan of these sorts of point-and-click narrative-driven experiences, then you'll adore Hatoful Boyfriend, as it both combines a legitimately enthralling narrative with a grand amount of humour, wit, and a tendency to subvert the tropes the genre is based on.It plays great, it looks great, and if you find that you like the characters' personalities, which are the driving force of the experience, then there is not a doubt in my mind that you will find yourself having fun when going through, even if it's just for the first couple of routes you decide on. Which, by the way, there are a total of sixteen of spread out amongst the game. It's honestly pretty impressive.Alright, now that that's out of the way, please play the game before reading any further. I'm dead serious. I do not spoil anything directly other than the personalities of each individual character and a couple other minor things, but I assure you that the experience is much better suited to play absolutely on your own. Go buy it right now, sit down, get a couple endings, and come back if you so choose.Or just ignore me and keep reading. Whatever's your cup of tea.The Actual ReviewTake this as a secondary line of caution even if you don't need one, but I cannot quite fit the full review on here. Instead, I've made a Google Document containing the rest of it.If you really want to slog through all of my detailed opinions, you can do so here:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O9psrhGKXXMgyj4W_GMLPY_5jq0LQl8koUbumt1PyM0Long story short, though, buy this game. Just do it."

I had a friend pestering me to play this for four years, and I always put it off because I didn't see the appeal of a pigeon dating sim.The game was fun, and I chuckled at some of the jokes, but nothing too much happened.  But as I played through more of the branches, more of the underlying story and world started catching my attention, and things started to come up that I wanted explanations for.I won't spoil anything, but I will say this - give this game a chance.  Play through all the main bird endings, and the real story will reveal itself to you.  It'll take this game from ""okay"" to ""great."""

76561198219030272,Recommended,310080,28231162,"Posted: 6 December, 2016",all,WhitewoodPhantom,"Initially, Hatoful Boyfriend struck me as a purely comedic otome game. Like many who chose to play it, I decided to go through it for kicks. Eventually, I learned that it is not what it seems at all. The more I progressed through the game the more immersed I became in it. I forgot all about the fact that it was meant to be a dating simulator where you court birds. I learned that it possesses all the trappings of classic visual novels. It is rife with plot twists and angst. The story is surprisingly deep, something I found to be a relief. As you go through the routes you obtain more and more pieces of the proverbial puzzle. They fit together pretty nicely at the end. I was glad to know that it is more than just some silly thing.Although it has many elements and troupes that are common in such games it presented them in a unique way, I think. However, my taste for it was admittedly acquired. After having went through a route in its entirety I became bored of many of the jokes and scenarios which had been scattered throughout it. For a time it was a bit of a chore to go through. Thankfully, the skip button helps you rush through the things you have already read, cutting out unnecessary game-time. You definitely need to be patient when going through Hatoful Boyfriend. I personally feel that in order to get the most enjoyment out of it you should go through one route at a time. That way you will have plenty of time to reflect on what happened as well as keep your interest in the plot fresh.PROS:> Overall, Hatoful Boyfriend is short and sweet. A basic route can be finished in an hour even if you are a slow reader. This makes it a great thing to play before going to bed or when you just need to kill some time for a while.> The art is soft, and the scenery colorful, making the backdrops pleasant. It is simple, but is still able to add to the mood.> While many of the characters and their stories are tried-and-true they are still ones you can get attached to (for the most part, anyway).> There is more than one unlockable route.> The story becomes more advanced as you progress through the game.CONS:> The protagonist is simple and impressionable.> During the main routes you do not get a lot of route-exclusive content. A lot of the scenarios are the ones you go through during the main story, so you end up having to read through much of what you already have.> The running gags get old fast.> You are unable to save at decision screens and must do so just before you are about to make a choice.> There are very few CGs.> Sometimes your saves will bring you to a backdrop and you cannot do anything at all so you have to exit and re-open the game (save your game in multiple slots just in case!).All in all, I think that Hatoful Boyfriend is enjoyable. I feel that it rewards you well for your diligence. The final, true story that is Hatoful Boyfriend is great. I absolutely love the BBL ending, and think that it was worth all the time I spent working to get it. I believe that it is a fairly solid purchase."

Compassionate, dramatic, this is writing that always knows when to take a moment for humor AND pathos. Let the deep and highly metaphoric story sink in over multiple playthroughs or you will be missing out on some of the best divergent storytelling of the generation.As you click through interaction after interaction just know that others are out there are taking time to do the same. Slowly begin to realize that some people can be trusted. It was people that made this game, after all, people finally aware of the  consumer fatigue of space marines and dragons. You may never fully rehabilitate into a properly functioning member of human society by their standards but you understand, just as I understand, that it is people that we do NOT understand. Remember, birds can be trusted, birds always come back. Some people are meant to be with people, and others, like us, are just different. We may not have the shiniest of neck feathers and our ultimate failing is to be aware that we are not aware. But we have finally found somewhere we can live in peace.Let us never forget the healing power of columbidae society but let us always try to remember to wash our berries before we eat them. Our digestive and respiratory systems may be different but blood is pumped into the heart from the body through the veins, the blood then enters the right atrium, then gets transported through the right ventricle and then is moved to into the lungs and oxygenated just the same.""In some things they shame us, by and large. Once mated, they are wed for life, unless forcibly separated. When set to the task, such as a long race, they will persevere and endure through measures of hell that only the best of men will willingly undertake. It might be argued that they are simply, dumbly, following the programming of instinct, that they can do nothing differently.Perhaps that can be said of us as well.""- Where Pigeons Go to Die."

Then fire it up again, and get ready for a ride......(I realize I haven't reviewed the actual game here.

You may even be moved to tears or scared s***less during your very first playthrough if you choose one of a few birds, a sharp wake-up call that this game is something more. By the second or third time you restart the game and court someone else, you begin to have your belief entirely suspended and forget that the characters aren't human.

This game is awesome.If you're curious about visual novels, but aren't really into the idea of playing a potentially NSFW dating sim (a.k.a. you're in the same boat as me), I recommend this highly to you. The concept of talking birds may be offputting to many, but I'm sure there have been cartoons and anime with stranger concepts. After a while, you'll likely stop caring that they're birds, and the script gently reminds you that you're a weird, freaky human through references to your hunter-gatherer instincts that you've honed through living in the wilderness.Each of the characters is a wonderful spoof of typical dating sim tropes (the senpai, the foreign exchange snob, the best friend, the nerd, the athlete, etc.), and the routes vary from sad to whimsical to just plain EPIC. And once you're finished with the routes... well, you've only hit the tip of the iceberg. This is a game that rewards the faithful, and your reward is a story you'll never forget as everything you thought you knew gets thrown out the window and reassembled in a whole new light.Trust me when I say you'll never look at pigeons the same way again."

I love almost everything about their writing, the nature of the narrative slowly unfolding non-linearly with each replay, and the exploration of character and testing the player's understanding of character.I love also how it critically looks at various staples of love-interests in romance in a way that romance novels rarely do. We have more than just the standard alpha-male.What I don't like about dating sims is that I have yet to find one which lets me just skip (not fast-forward - SKIP) scenes I've seen before and the sheer amount of grinding involved in stat building. Sometimes I want to do-away with stat-building completely and take a page out of Moacube's book where you have other types of decisions which advance plot define your character's character and ""stats"".Hatoful tries to make stat building more connected to plot by actually providing you with a unique scene along with each stat building time point. However, I still found the stat building unecessary. I also found the needing to romance a character in two different ways in order to unlock the epilogue really...arduously boring.That said, Hatoful Boyfriend improves on a lot of other dating sim mechanics and really invests in taking the player's preconceptions of whimsy and istead offers a genuinely good science fiction story. There is a lot of depth in this game should you commit to seeking it and a lot of heart.I still await the day where we work towards dating sims that remove grinding, whether that's re-doing vast stretches of story to get to new scenes or improve (or do away with) the stat building. Sadly, Hatoful Boyfriend still suffers from both, though to a lesser extent than the average dating sim. This detracted from my experience. I still heartily recommend this game as amongst one of the top games you can play in its genre. (Seriously.)"

The images and art used is high quality as standard, although a couple of birds do seem a bit blurry and pixelated.

Going into it you might think its just a weird Japanese visual novel about dating birds. And, well, it sort of is. But what you wouldn't know without playing it is just how much more there is to this game.The vast amount of diversity speaks volumes of the effort put into making this game the experience that it is. Although it is classed as a dating sim, this is one of the few games that tackles many other genres, and actually does it well. Basically, each of the different characters' story lines you can follow are unique to one another. Each character has a very different personality and backstory, as well as their routes have their own uniqe themes and plots that other characters routes don't necessarily have a focus on. This is what makes this such a great game, because it makes you WANT to complete every route so you can learn the whole story, rather than making you feel like you have to suffer through several playthroughs of the same thing to get the end result. Each of the different characters stories are enjoyable and entertaing in their own unique way, be it a sweet romance, or a bone-chilling mystery, they are all very different.Then of course, there is the secret ""true ending"" story route, wheather it can be called that or not, it is one of the most fantastic works of story telling I have ever experienced in a visual novel. I'm not going to spoil anything, as it really should be played without any prior knowledge or spoilers, but I strongly encourage players to play through every possible story route even if some may be silly at times, as that's what gives this game its charm. Each one of the stories you can play through will entertain you with silly jokes, emotion evoking plots, or even suspensful and horrorific secrets. Then after all those memorable events, you will be able to enjoy yet another very unique, very interesting, and very well written and played out ""true ending"" scenario. I could talk for hours about how great all the individual routes and the overarching plots are, but it is truely something that is best left for you, the player, to discover by playing the game for yourselves.If you havn't yet bought Hatoful Boyfriend, or are maybe considering the purchase but are unsure if you will enjoy it, then you have my reccomendation to buy and play this game, and  that it will be something that you'll be able to enjoy playing, and re-playing, for a very long time to come. For the amount of content this game has, it is definately worth buying. Through all of its silly laughs, its shocking secrets, and its heartbreaking emotional moments, Hatoful Boyfriend has become a personal favourite, and hopefully you will enjoy it too."

It touches upon the existance of the supernatural, and the consequences of mingling with fate and the higher order. The juxtaposition between the birds and the humans is highlighted as you interact with key characters. You will have to face with and debate against (or for) political issues that will directly affect your well-being.

It's difficult to classify this game as something other than a dating sim, because it can become more than that depending on your choices. It's also very difficult to discuss this game without resorting to ""omg look at this wacky game! It's soooooooo random! XD"" Don't let the Pewdiepie hype portrayed by many streamers deter you from even glancing at this due to your disgust. Those people are the same idiots that also scream, ""Dark Souls is too hard! Golly, this is so epic!""I can say, first and foremost, that this is a visual novel. Regardless of sub-genre, that's what this boils down to.It's a very intriguing visual novel. It performs under the guise of a classic Japanese high school dating sim while donning the peculiar gimmick of having birds for the school's students. While this may sound extremely gimmicky, and I won't lie, it is. That is not necessarily a bad thing though! This allows for a different kind of exploration into one's feelings.Can you get emotionally attatched to a bird to some degree?You would not think so, but these birds are essentially people-type characters. They talk, have inner/outter conflicts, and even run in marathons. I can also imagine the same could happen if it was a high school ofSuper Robots, but it's not. That would be an awesome game. We need that to be on Steam right now.If you're still interested at this point you'd might as well start reading further into this. Let's face it; if you're interested in a dating sim with birds, then you probably have few other things to entertain you at this point in terms of modern gaming.Would I even like a dating sim with birds where I would not be able to even date females?That's how I felt, but I was tired of the typical tropes of AAA games and decided that I would instead let myself fall victim to the cliches of standardized Japanese gaming this time around. I was absolutely correct in the aspect of dating sim cliches remaining intact, but I was not prepared for the fact that there are routes that rip the afforementioned apart. If you're reading through Fate/Stay Night, then of course you'd expect things to become intense and heavy. When you play an average dating sim you're just expecting two people to get together and happy things ensue with a nice ending, save for School Days. That was just depressing on about every level.You won't expect things once they hit you in Hatoful Boyfriend, and that is the true glory of the writing in this game. It just happens to be covered in a feathery layer topped with a beak.I fully recommend this title to visual novel enthusiasts, or anyone who just wants to dive into the visual novel genre for their first time.

There's an interesting, hidden underlying story that gradually gets revealed as you play through different birds' stories and endings.In summary, I didn't know what to expect from Hatoful Boyfriend, but it surprised and delighted me.

Based on forums, this game may trigger high level of depression called ""Avatar Effect"" play it on your own risk!You think that birds are dumb primitive creatures? Not true! For example, pigeons are learning and teaching matematics and music, they have complex relationships with each other. I had problems with japanese names. As a mid-European kid, i fell far from the manga genre, grew up on american comics and though i have my own manga favourites, i was not able to get too close enough to the genre. I remember the great battles of Yu Yu Hakusho with Yusuke Urameshi and Kazuma Kuwabara, the midriff tearing brilliant humorous moments of Slayers with Lina Inverse and Gourry Gabriev, or DBZ's Shongoku, before it was banned from my country. But that's it.I read about Hatoful Boyfriend on hungarian gaming sites, there are no animal pornography, and too much foolish detailed conversations bout it, as they told. The protagonist is a human girl, the other actors are mostly male pigeons, they have been introduced themselves early at the story. Many lives, many fates, player deciding what will happen next, there are silly and realistic, serious topics too, it depends on us what kind of ending we get. There are a lot, so the re-playability of the game is high, it is like visiting parallel dimensions. The characters are very well personalized and all different lovely fellas, i don't want to spolier anything so i better stop here.The music is very great, reminding me for the music of early Sims games, relaxing, there are 1-2 rock tracks too, reflecting for the current topic's mood.Locations are drawn, with bird photos, and some drawn manga characters if we enable them at start.This product is not that i've imagined based on the media, it is much, much more!

""A dating sim, but all the boys are pigeons?"" I thought, ""Sounds incredible, I have to play."" And sure enough, it was incredible. Just not in the way I expected.Hatoful Boyfriend is funny, it's true, it has a very funny and quirky sense of humor that will be incredibly enjoyable for anyone who enjoys puns or jokes that almost slip under your radar, but when you catch them make you snort with amusment. Oh, and the fact that your character, as the only human in a school full of pigeons, is treated in the same stereotypical way that a singular intellegent bird would probably be treated if the situation was reversed (""stereotypical"" human/primate behavior, constant references to her species in both jokes and regular conversation, she literally lives in a cave), is very funny as well. However, the real charm of Hatoful Boyfriend is when it is not being funny. This game, at times, is much more serious than you would think possible, even heartwrenching and disturbing. This game will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will constantly shock you (assuming you manage to avoid spoilers before playing, which is very recommended as the shock is part of the game's charm) and keep you interested and wanting to play all the way to the end.I pirated this game years ago expecting a joke game and now I've bought the $15 special edition on steam because I believe that this game absolutely deserves every penny. This game has made such a big impact on me, it is easily one of the best visual novel-type games that I have ever played and I would absolutely reccommend it to anyone and everyone with the attention span for visual novels. Even if you don't think you have the attention span, watch a playthrough or try it out somehow because this is one game that really should not be missed.

Most people will look at this game, play through maybe one or two routes, write it off as ""jokey birb game"", and, unfortunately, never touch it again. Which sucks, considering the real meat of this game lies in the epilogue, where the genre does a complete 180.This game goes from animu-like dating sim with some hilarious parodies of a lot of visual novel tropes (with the exception of the Nageki route, which deals with some very heavy subjects), to a murder mystery full of twists and turns, with some surprisingly disturbing horror elements thrown in. There were at least three different points where I thought the game was about to end, but it just kept throwing more and more curveballs at me.The core game is full of wonderful silliness and knows what it is. The characters and their personalities are memorable and hilarious.Definitely a must-complete kind of game. Took me around 10 hours to go through every route and get the true ending. :)"

I played the demo on the original site and boy was I wrong. Yes the game can indeed be very sweet but it can also be very dark. The game had a depth and was so well written that I had never expected. Now I will say I have played LOADS of visual novel games and am very finicky about which ones I buy. The moment this game came to Steam I bought it the first moment I noticed it was there.Its well written, the characters are well developed and believeable (with the exception of Okasan and Aghel but that's how they are supposed to be), the music is lovely and well fitted to the areas they are used, it had multiple endings which depended on your stats in some cases, you actually LEARN the birds names which were chosen to represent the men you can be with in this game and its just engrossing. The game itself is a definite recommend.Now I will look at the extra you get with Hatoful Boyfriend Collectors Edition:It comes with the soundtrack which as I said its a lovely soundtrack and it seems to include all of the songs.The wallpapers was disappointing. It just came with two wallpapers featuring the purple heart background and fantail pigeons.The comic is short but sweet. Each character has two mini comics (4 frames) after them. It doesn't add to the story in any way its just quite sweet. Though there was only one that made me laugh.The yearbook. I will say this now its not a yearbook. Its actually just a virtual artbook made to look like a yearbook which disappointed me greatly. I hoped it would be Tosaka's year book with pictures of her class inside and signed with a message from each of the main characters but no such luck. The art work is quite nice but not what I was expecting.The actual game is definitely worth a buy but the collector's edition I'd advise you only get if it was on offer for a £1 or two (three if you really want it) Its not worth its £5 price tag."

My favorite birdie is Yuuya, but I don't think I have a least favorite. They're all super fun and creatively designed.-This game keeps surprising me.Low Points:-There probably won't be a lot of replayability :/-Yuuya's romance was hard to figure out; I got the Bad Ending just trying the first go around, and Ryouta fell in love with me the second time. I ended up looking up the first couple steps to get myself on the right track. I also have no idea how to romance Azumi. This game gives you goals and no instruction manual!-The soundtrack kind of bothers me. It doesn't fade or change evenly, but stops abruptly when scenes shift or ends when a scene times out (I left my computer for a while and came back and the game was absolutely silent).

Events barely change based on your choices, if at all.- While the characters are interesting, they are given no time to be fleshed out in their routes because scenes start and end so quickly. You get maybe ten lines of text, often times less, in scenes like the festival or sports event. The difference between a good endign and a bad ending for the routes that have multiple ones is a small bit of extra text at the very end.- A lot of the jokes fall flat, referencing anime tropes, etc. which was probably intentional given that the game is meant for the shock value. I can give this a pass because it is trying to recreate a stereotypical date sim.- The stat-raising element is pointless and makes an otherwise mind-numbingly simple game frustrating to solve without a walkthrough. Example: for some reason, not hinted at anywhere, you can only getShuu's good endingif youpick ""math"" for your elective every time.- Some of the character portraits are blurry on larger resolutions. The audio is pretty good aside from some low quality sound effects and at least one music track I recognize as most likely stock music.I really like the over-the-top personalities and I think they really could've hit it out of the park if they were given more time to develop. Once you've gone through the game one time you can skip through every bit of in-between dialogue that isn't character specific, leaving around 20 minutes of actual gameplay per route.It's times like these where I wish you could select an option between ""no"" and ""yes"" in steam reviews because, for what the game is, it's very cute. When it's shocking, it's shocking. when it's funny, it's funny. Perhaps the game improves in the final route (I already feel things bubbling under the surface) but the lack of comforts of a typical visual novel and general lack of functionality make it REALLY uncomfortable to drudge through the game several times over, despite how short it really is."

But here's the thing: if you like the idea, you're going to like the game more than that. While all the characters are recognizable tropes, they're executed in engaging ways. The main character herself is weird and enthusiastic and charming. The writing (and translation) is light and humorous until the moments where suddenly it's *not*, and the transitions there are nimble. came for the lols, stayed for the surprising quality.And then there's the BBL route, the one you unlock after you've gotten an ending with each major character. Do yourself a favor and clear all the other endings first, both so you'll have as much character background as possible and so you can unlock the epilogue right away. Then clear a few hours to play through the whole thing -- it probably took almost half my total play time -- make the ""fulfill a promise from long ago"" choice at the start of a new game, and let your hunter-gatherer instincts lead the way.Pigeon dating sim: why so great."

The first part was definitely what you expect it to be: an otome game with pigeons. But after you unlock the BBL route...it all gets more sinister, bloody, somehow violent. The story of the BBL ending is definitely surprising, I definitely didn't expect it to be SO good. My poor heart aches, it's so beautiful. Unexpected. The characters are much more complex than it seems. They're not just birds in a dating sim game.This game was surprisingly good, I hope many other people will play it and complete it. The BBL route is amazing. Please, play this game. You won't regret this.I highly recommend to play the Shuu Iwamine's and Anghel's endings right before unlocking the BBL ending, expecially the doctor's ones, which are the most ""dark"" endings among the others."

And I'll not forget all the memorable lines my character did during the playthrough, she was quite funny, and that helped me to not get bored in some routes (Ninja doctor, seriously?).Believe me, if you are looking for something funny to waste 20 minutes on a day, here is the perfect game, but warning, there's a plot here, and a pretty good one, with really memorable characters, fun dialogue and an ending that will leave you really satisfied, even if it has nothing to do with your character.So I'll say 8/10. It's not perfect because it can get boring trying to get all the endings, but it's a really simple game to amuse you (Get Azami's and Okosan's full ending and you'll understand why) for a little while before making you cry with some really good twists."

I did in 2012 when it first came out on another website. I bought the game and decided to go for the most familiar bird to me. The Mourning Dove, Nageki.A young boy who died too young. He was put in a medical centre because of his weak immune system. He had a disease, the H5N1 virus. It was able to kill the humans that killed Nageki's family. However, he didn't want to kill the humans. He said he couldn't live anymore, so he threw himself into the fire he lit in the centre's basement.This game turned sad when I reached his ending. I decided to replay it, this time going for the fluffball of a partridge, Shuu, or shall I sayIsa Souma.His ending made this game much darker. I decided to play the rest of the game. After I played Ryouta's ending, a new choice popped up.I could fulfill a promise. I didn't know it at the time, but I wasn't Hiyoko when I made the choice. I was the Doctor. Shuu wanted to fulfill the promise he made to someone he loved. The game switched genres before my eyes. It went from a supposedly silly dating simulator to a horrifying murder mystery with pigeons.This game, while being amazing, has a few flaws, but they are quite small compared to the pros. The grammar isn't very good compared to some games, but what do you expect from a game translated into English from Japanese. There are also numerous plot holes that aren't solved unless you buy the sequel, Holiday Star. Likewhy Hitori bleached his feathers. Most believe that it was to hide his true identity to get revenge on Shuu. While that is true, there is a second reason.Overall, this game is fantastic. It gets you hooked on the eerie and sad twists and then just makes a 360 turn into pigeon hell. There is no escaping now.Rating8 running Okosan's out of 10."

Don't let the pigeons fool you, it's not simply a gimmick, the author honest to god loves birds and it really shows! When I played the original version a few years back, I initially was grinning like an idiot to sobbing uncontrollably and this game gave me feelings I never asked for or expected at all. It's definitely more than what it appears to be on the surface, so if you love visual novels or don't mind text heavy stuff I'd highly recommend this. Plus, proceeds do contribute to the purchase of toys and food for the real life version of some of these birds. You wouldn't want to leave Okosan hungry, would you?If you've already played the game, this adds an Azami route and polishes up backgrounds and for me, the text was much easier on the eyes. If you haven't played before, prepare for a wild ride and an intense urge to hold hands with fluffy pigeons.

It also helps that Hatoful Boyfriend is very replayable.Gameplay: Just like any visual novel, the gameplay boils down to reading text boxes and occasionally making a decision. Which isn't a bad thing as long as your prepared for it and know what you're getting into.Presentation: The game has a very cute art style that goes for more cartoonish than realistic and the fact that the character models are cut out from actual pictures of birds is a nice touch. Unfortunately a lot of areas get reused do to the setting of the game.Verdict: Hatoful Boyfriend is a charming game with some slight problems that fortunately aren't that bad or game breaking. So in conclusion Hatoful Boyfriend gets a 9/10. It is a must buy. It has great quality for a ten dollar game."

Well, my soul was somewhat consumed for about 10 hours of gameplay because I couldn't stop playing. I was frustrated the first day and ready to quit and wah about what a waste of money it was but after I picked up some of the birds' personalities it got a lot easier to navigate. The only thing I DON'T like about this game is there are a few ""normal"" vs ""true"" endings to some of the storylines (which are annoyingly similar but a PIA to figure out), and you need to get all of them to unlock the last chapter which is honestly very worth all the time you may or may not throw into the game. I think it does make a diference that these are birds and they're not really animated looking which spruces up the whole visual novel thing...and makes the entire story, characters, and interactions that much goofier and entertaining. There is more darker content than you'd expect, but that's not a bad thing at all. Though I've gone through the main storylines a hundred times now to unlock all the endings I would play the BBL ending again because it has high replay/story value. Hope if you get it you enjoy!"

But there are many giggles.This game is as cute as it gets. You've got all these birds and they're all so different. At first glance you might think they're stereotypes come to life, but as it is with most people, there's more than meets the eye. Everybirdie has something special about them.I didn't even think I'd want to complete every single path, but sure enough I did. The BBL ending definitely gives you the most intriguing ending with lots of mystery and lots of Sakuya (eeeeee excuse me while I fangirl). I must admit my favourite endings were the more lighthearted ones though, the ones that were sweet and fluffy. And carve it into your soul, kid! There were many great endings. It's hard to pick a favourite.Also I thought Ryouta's path would be a bit more boring because he's the typical childhood-friend-turned-true-love kind of story everyone seems to love, but I think it was the most rewarding end.I really appreciate how the writer(s) approached topics like disability, status and even teacher crushes. There was never a point where I thought ""Hmm, this seems inappropriate and harmful"". Especially in a ""dating sim"" I even expected problematic moments, but there weren't any. I was overjoyed by that.WARNING: If you plan to do all the endings, this game does have its share of the violent and the gruesome. While you're not going to see blood and guts, trust me, some of the content in this game is very disturbing. There's murder (which I thought would give me nightmares nearly), suicide (which is dealt with quite respectfully) and probably other stuff I can't think of right now.For a so-called dating sim, this game isn't overly romantic. It feels more like a friendship sim than dating, to be perfectly honest. I loved that about this game. It surpassed every expectation.One complaint is the typos, specifically in the BBL ending. Way too many, and it made otherwise hard-hitting lines come off a little...underwhelming. But seriously, don't let that deter you. Just know that it's there, but that's one of my only real complaints.Lastly, I just want to mention the characters, who are all extremely rich and satisfying to learn about. I had a soft spot for Nageki, Ryouya, Sakuya and Yuuya. But surprisingly, the playable character is also super interesting as well! As you go through the endings, you learn about the bird of the hour but also quite a bit on who you're playing as too.Get. This. Game. Do yourself a service."

An April Fool's day joke gone way too far in the best way possible.""Quirky"" is an excellent way to describe this game. At first glance, it's easily overlooked and labelled as 'too weird' and 'odd', but rest assured the game itself is much more fantastic than that. (Although, to be fair, the oddity is a part of its charm.) Go in with an open mind and it isn't hard to be sucked into this world and all its shenanigans.The re-release has updated the graphics beautifully and any fan of otome games with a good sense of humor is bound to love this game. The save option in the bottom right-hand corner makes it incredibly easy pause the game whenever necessary and pick up exactly where you left off without having to wait for a check-point or anything of the sort.The routes and birds are all very entertaining and lovable in their own ways. Nageki is my personal favorite and I fell in LOVE as soon as I saw him (possibly loved him even more after I found out about his tragic backstory). They'll make you cry, laugh, scream, coo, and give you a reason to see each one of their endings. Luckily, it's not hard to achieve these endings either seeing as a mistake or two will still typically allow you to complete the route (with the exception of a few birds if you choose to get their ""Best end"" or ""full end"" routes).Another note worth mentioning is that the protagonist of this game is very well done! For most otome games, I personally find the protagonists to lack a little bit of personality and tend to be quite generic (this is usually due to the fact that the player's choices determine what the protagonist's personality is like) but with this game, there is no worry. Hiyoko (if you choose to maintain the default name) is as amusing as she is quirky, and her cheerful hunter-gatherer demeanor will work its way into your heart just as well as any of the other birds in the game while maintaining the ability to make personalized choices.If you enjoyed Hatoful Boyfriend and have not bought the DLC, then I suggest you go do so. The same goes for the holiday sequel, Hatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star (which has extra content) and is a must-buy if you fell in love with the characters and their stories like I did.10/10 Would buy again.

What originally started out as a visual novel about dating pigeons, eventually becomes a visual novel about dating pigeons with deep and complex personalities.The game (or should I say the visual novel) itself is nothing complex, the closest thing to gameplay here is making a decision. Though your decision will ultimately decide who you choose to get close with and how the game ends.Speaking of the story, it is quite entertaining. The writing is fantastic, and all of the characters have their own lovable quirks, in fact the route you take can vastly affect the mood of the story. After going on a certain route, you can do the hidden route which unless you've gotten all the ending (which includes both the normal and true ending for every character) you won't see the epilogue. Getting all of the ending means you have to read through a lot of the things you've read before, there is a fast forward button; but sometimes new dialogues could appear in a scene that you expected to play as usual.Overall Hatoful Boyfriend is an entertaining visual novel about dating pigeons...That was anti-climatic."

,Recommended,310080,12918739,"Posted: 12 November, 2014",all,JakkelR4psc4llion,"Hatoful Boyfriend is a visual novel video game about a high-school age Japanese human girl who lives in a cave and attends a very prestigious prep school for pigeons. Very early on, the game offers you the option to see ""human portrait"" versions of every male pigeon when you meet them and from there on, you must decide which pigeon to date. With that all in mind, believe me when I say that this game will suprise you with just how insane it is, and I love it all the more for that reason (among others).My first introduction to the genre of Japanese visual novels was with Sakura Spirit, and that really only had tons of fan-service and an adorable story about cute yet desperately horny furries and their friends. While I enjoyed the fan-service, I felt Sakura Spirit was pretty hollow as a visual novel as it only gave the player one choice to make in the entire game. So when it came time for me to give Hatoful Boyfriend a try, I was hooked immediately by the web of choices waiting to be discovered in the game. Where Sakura Spirit had a single choice that would only partially change the game, Hatoful Boyfriend has a string of multiple reactions that will end up in different endings. Where Sakura Spirit had badly translated sensuality and fanservice, Hatoful Boyfriend has full blown insanity with extremely well-written plot twists. The only other game I've played where I was this desperate to replay the game in hopes of seeking out different endings was the Stanley Parable, and believe me when I say that this game is so much more worthy of a multiple ending gag game.While the premise and initial setting for the game is pretty absurd and quirky, you are given several indications through gameplay of what type of world you live in that condones human-pigeon relationships and are given several possible endings, depending on which male bird you choose and HOW you choose them (i.e. submissively, dominantly, romantically, accidentally, etc.). Some of these endings range from the sad, to the silly, to the absurd, to the horrific, to the gut-wrenchingly insane (the ""Fallen Anghel"" ending blew my mind), to the downright non-canon. Like so many other visual novels and multi-ending video games, Hatoful Boyfriend's appeal lies in discovering each new ending and all the options hidden away in the game. Overall, the music is fitting, the translation is superb and the risk of actually dying all give the game that much more appeal.If you like insane Japanese exports, visual novels, bizarre stories of interspecies love and the support/shame it gives rise to  or a combination of all three of these things than you should definitely check out Hatoful Boyfriend!100% COMPLETION EDIT: I just finished playing the final ending. The game definitely gets deeper and darker the more endings you uncover. It make start out silly, cute and quirky, but it gets pretty grim. Very well-written, though.YEARS LATER EDIT: Yep, still a great game."

On first look, it's just a regular dating simulation. How wrong I was. As you gradually take time to understand each character, you start learning about the secrets that were harboured in the school itself. Ultimately, you confront yourself with a sinister plot that would not have been expected at first.Characters and storyline are well developed enough to leave an impression on you. The music works well in relation to the story and happenings at the point they're played, although sound effects in certain parts of the game seems a little overdone. They still work, since it fits the storyline and has to be in place for the experience of players.Frankly speaking, I am still amazed by the tension and humour the joke of a bird dating simulation has given me.

However this game should be the No. 1 priority for Steam users if they are looking into immersing themselves in visual novels for the first time. Of course, users can play visual novels that are not on Steam such as Katawa Shoujo (which is exceptionally good by the way), but we should seize the opportunity Lord GabeN has given us, allowing us to play dating simulators on the legendary platform known as Steam. So don't lose this opportunity!Hatoful Boyfriend is a visual novel game in which the player dates pigeons. Although this may sound like an unusual concept, we gamers are always looking out on the market for the latest innovative games which bring new concepts and ideas to the congested video game market. Although the visual novel genre isn't especially innovative, the idea of having a romantic relationship between the protagonist, you, and various male pigeons is certainly innovative. Therefore I am giving this game a thumbs up.This may seem like a review just to laud the game's innovation and creativity. However, the gameplay and graphics are also up to par with the other releases which have come out at around the same time as this game. Even though this game is a visual novel, it provides immersive gameplay which will keep players like myself hooked on for hours at a time. The soundtrack for the game is one of the best in the market, which is why I purchased the Digital Deluxe version of the game, which includes the song's soundtrack!PositivesExceptional graphics (Can be considered a benchmarking tool similar to what Ryse: Son of Rome was on PC).Exceptional storyline (Not as good as Barbie Dreamhouse Party but still better than The Last of Us).Exceptional optimization (Runs better than Assassin's Creed: Unity).Exceptional gameplay (Combine Flappy Bird and Angry Birds).Exceptional characters (Especially Okosan).MixedNo nudity (Depends whether you like nude pigeons or not. If you do, I do not know if there is an uncensored version out there...).NegativeNo anti-aliasing (I feel like the graphics could be even more amazing if there was some anti-aliasing).Not enough pigeons (I need more to suppress my desires...).Even though this game has some negatives about it, I would still consider it to be GOTY. We all know there is no such thing as a perfect video game. The positives heavily outweigh the negatives and that is all that matters. So therefore, I hope that you have carefully read this review and will pick this game up as soon as possible. If you are not overly convinced that this game is amazing yet, I suggest reading the other 1,500 or so reviews on the store page!8/8(I hope you didn't expect this review to be legitimate XD)"

It's well animated, if a little generic; the soundtrack fits well with every scene; the pigeons are all different, personality and voice wise, and they put a lot of effort into the game.

And to some degree, I agree with them.  A great deal of this was only mildly entertaining and I did not understand why people (especially close friends of mine) loved this game.  The game begins with the main character (a female...  yes, you play a female in a dating sim...) starting her sophomore year [unsure if right or not] and during the next year dates several bird-boy-people-things...  NOW, you must be wondering, ""Why is a girl dating birds!?  How can she develop intimate feelings for these avian creatures!?  HOW CAN THE BIRDS FRICKIN' ACT LIKE HUMAN BEINGS!?!?!?""  Put those questions aside when you play the story, but just don't forget about them entirely.Each character's dating route got progressively more funny and interesting the more I played it, EXCEPT FOR ONE which made me feel like I was mashing my head against a wall for doing something so inanely stupid as it was not a good route to take...  If you play the game, you will know the one because you will think the main character is dumb.  After playing through just about every route at least once, I unlocked a new route that was only available to begin in the beginning.  THIS FINAL ROUTE, HOO BOY IT WAS A DOOZY!This final route made the entire game so much more worth it, and answered soooooooo maaaaaannyyyyyy quuueeestions!  OH, and if you want to do the epilogue, you need to get all endings before doing the Final Route (There are some characters with TWO endings, one being a normal ending and the other being a TRUE ending...).I am not really going to talk about the final route too much, but let me just say that this game was a rollercoaster of funny moments and intense plots.I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME, but it sometimes felt annoying to play through a route again JUST for the epilogue...  Good thing this game has a skip function to speed through text...  Saved me MUCH MORE TIME than I would have done, if that function wasn't in the game.In short, if you love games with fantastic stories, GET THIS GAME NOW!"

Surely those who've dipped their toes in the water may know that, yes, indeed this water is very wet, but only those who've dived in can describe the tresures hidden beneath the surface.This game surely isn't for everyone.All in all, it IS a visual novel. The largest amount of ""gameplay"" you'll ever run into would happen to be a few faux RPG fight sequences that could hardly be taken seriously. This whole game took a lot of effort to sell me on. I'd been prowling the marketplace for months debating the price and eventually settled during a sale.Actually, I consider this game to be split into two segments that differ drastically: The dating segment and theHurtfulsegment.The first segment happened to be the more tedious portion. Our main goal is to pick a bird you are aiming to participate in a little fowl play with and pick all the moves necessary to cater to their interests. A typical visual novel in terms of dating. However, the stats tend to play a large role in HOW you progress and what endings you achieve. Certain characters have certain endings that are achieved by simply honing all your extra classes into upgrading one stat.Dating happens to be the brightest, stereo-typical, schmaltzy part of the game hence why I originally dived in this game as a joke. The blame of why dating happens to be so teeth grindingly annoying when you play this game is placed on the factTHE SAVE MECHANIC IS FAULTY.Nine times out of ten, your save will not load properly forcing you to exit the entire game and restart from the beginning.Having to restart entirely becomes moreso apparent when you have certain characters with multiple endings. Going through the entire game again.Ain't. Fun.This makes getting all the endings and unlocking the second portion of the game a test on patience. The novelty wears out quick after seeing Okosan introduce himself typical juggernaut style for the fifteenth freaking time in two hours.It's not a wonder most people wouldn't make it past the first segment, but with a little perserverence, ibuprophen and a nice guide, you unlock the meat and all it's fixins.The second portion is where this game honestly shines in story. The gameplaysags terribly here,but it wasn't something you'd miss after the trek to this point anyway. Trust me when I say that this portion of the game is wherethat entire kawaii, ha-ha nice joke facade is crumbled into little pieces then obliterated into dust. This portion is dark both atmospherically and aesthetically. The pallet dims to a much creepier violet tone and you know things get serious when this game brings out the worst.The second portion is what really reeled me in. It was this game's saving grace for me.I remember the moment everything clicked in my head, I drew back in shock. And I loved every second of it.However, in the end, things turned outbetter than I thought they would.I misjudged a lot of characters, a lot of things changed and I felt satisfied with a majority of it.I wasn't happy on their dark horse they decided to needed some phoenix down for kicks, though. I was not a happy camper.Will I ever play this game again? Not on my own time.For a stream, there is potential, but the replayability is fleeting.Overall I give this a 7/10, 3.5/5"

Never have I been so drawn into pigeons.Like everyone else here, I was drawn in by the promise of a silly dating SIM involving birds. I didn't expect this game to be anything intensely amazing. So, when I began, though I had read plenty of reviews, I did not take too many of them that seriously. At first I wasn't overly impressed. The storyline itself seemed solid, though a bit vauge, and the choices that you are allowed in the game are relatively few. It's more a reading adventure than anything, and I quickly learned how to make each bird like me. However, the storyline wasn't nearly so well made as the reviews had spoken of. I had my favorites, of course, but the game seemed a little flat and lacking even at the deepest stories (my personal favorites are Nageki's and Sakuya's), and I disliked the lack of ability to interact with other birds while trying to woo a specific fowl.And then, though tenacity and determination, I got through all 14 endings, and everything changed.I won't say anything about the BBL ending. It needs to be played to be appreciated. But this story? This entire game is a work of art. I sat for three hours straight, playing the ending alone, just gaping at how well and perfectly everything fit together, with all the character interaction I had been missing and the complex storylines and depth that the game has been lauded for.This game is worth every penny.There are some technical difficulties I'm not impressed with. The save feature, for me, was a joke. Half the time the game would glitch and freeze when a save point was loaded, and made me have to go through and replay the game again. I saw the intro at least 12 times, which is more times than anyone needs to be introduced to each bird and can get sickeningly boring. The game also had a tendancy to freeze at important decisions, making me have to replay yet again, so it became a real effort in patience trying to deal with these glitches without throwing it out. All through the three hour ending, I was on the edge of my seat half expecting to have to go through most of it again because it might decide to freeze on me. Thankfully, it did not do any such thing, and I was able to enjoy myself through the massive and bright storyline *ehehe*.I also don't reccomend this game for those who are sensitive to gore and murder. Not because it shows any, because it doesn't, but some of these storylines get rather... descriptive of these things. I wouldn't say it's anything for kids, for sure.Even with these issues, if you're on the fence, tip over and fly. You won't regret it.~Kero"

I believe that was over 3 years ago now? When I originally heard of this game, I of course reacted like everyone else. ""Wow, absurd crazy Japanese dating sim about... birds??? This is so ridiculous that I have to play it.""A big thing that completely goes over peoples' heads, a conclusion they never seem to come to when they see this game in the Steam store, or when they saw it online wherever for the first time is... could this possibly be tongue-in-cheek? You know, a parody of generic Dating Sim/Visual Novel tropes? Which is kind of crazy to be honest, considering that's what immediately should be coming to their mind - that yes, this game parodies a lot of silly Visual Novels that take themselves far too seriously.The first portion of this game, the ""normal high school life"" routes, a lot of them use very cliché anime/RPG/Dating Sim tropes, particularly Okosan's slice-of-life, non-serious route, Shuu's sort of yandere true ending, and Anghel's downright crazy and completely non-canon route (is it technically non-canon, considering the effect Anghel causes upon those around him?), but they're written in such a self-aware way, a lot of these storylines know fully well how ridiculous they are and they're not ashamed to be so.A lot of the routes do give a bit of insight into each of the characters and you can start to piece things together, but the bulk of the actual plot comes in final route, the Bad Boys Love ending. Hatoful Boyfriend is not a dating sim. The Dating Sim section, in my opinion, was simply a very clever selling point of the game. It is essentially used as such because the devlopers KNEW people would buy something so out there, and for shock value. When you start to realise truly how dark this game is, it's genuinely shocking.If this game was depicted as a serious visual novel about a political faction with extreme racist views, and their goal to rid Earth of the opposing race through means of biological weaponry, even if that requires unethical treatment of their own kind, this game would have been critically acclaimed. Which is funny, because that's EXACTLY what this game is about. There's a lot more to it than that, but that's the basic plot.Albeit the writing is a bit goofy at times, even in serious parts, and there's a lot of unnecessary gore, this game is extremely cleverly written. Despite disguising itself as a dating sim at first glance, and being a mockery to those who haven't played it, this game has pretty interesting politIcal undertones and social commentary, and honestly? I'm awfully more attached to talking birds than I was to any of the characters in westerm, artsy, ""plot heavy"" (but not really) indie games on Steam such as Thomas Was Alone.But yeah, I'd love to give Hatoful Boyfriend a 10/10 for how well marketed and well put together this game is, along with its amazingly witty writing, but I have to give it a 9.5 for being unnecessarily, I guess, ""edgy"" and fanfiction-esque at times.P.S. I've very tempted to figure out a way of rewriting the entire script of this game to be... well, not about birds, and sending it to my friends not telling them what it is.

I'm trying to keep spoilers to a minimum for this, but there's gonna be some.This game is about dating fictional birds. Fictional. Birds. The setting may be ridiculous and silly, and the gameisridiculous and silly, but it has a surprising amount of depth. Being a new student at St. Pidgeonation's high school, you have the option of dating a total of 9 birds. The first few routes (Ryouta, Sakuya, Nageki, etc.) are fairly easy to complete and find, but there are a few well hidden ones that grant a deeper (or more silly) look at the world that Mediatronic and co. built.Speaking of the world, it has very little consistency. While the majority of it is explained away inYuuya's routeandBBL routethe story just doesn't hold for a lot of what we see. That is kind of expected - it isn't easy or even necessary to build a wholly consistent world for what is a mostly comedic game. But, strangely, there is a surprising amount of lore that is explained throughout the game, especially in the de-facto true ending.That lore involves a rollercoaster of emotions. What is essentially a comedic game devolves into a tragedy by the end, if you're willing to stick through it. Mind you, good luck keeping that will. Some parts do drag on for too long (which is very annoying in a visual novel) and the bright and happy UI impairs the immersion when the situation is dire. If you like your story with twists, though, this game will not dissapoint. Just be prepared to sit through a few hours of glorious bird dating first. On the other hand, if you only want to date those birds, don't pick to complete the promise when you get the chance. It's a major change in tone and there's really no bird dating involved in that route.Gameplay-wise, it's a visual novel with RPG elements. While the RPG elements are only useful in a couple of routes, they are important to getting some of the good endings for some characters as well as finishing them altogether. I suggest using a guide because things can get messy very quickly and you WILL miss some routes without one. The visual novel aspect, on the other hand... it's a ren'py game, and it is hard to say much beyond that. There are some minor bugs here and there, but they aren't game breaking.It's a solid visual novel / dating sim with a surprising amount of depth and plot on the inside. As a bird dating sim, it's a 7/10. With all the twists and world involved, I'm willing to give it an 8 for the effort, even if it isn't executed perfectly.8/10."

,Recommended,310080,33112109,Posted: 1 July,all,Zeta_Riemann,"This is probably one of my favourite games of all time.. Wait no scratch that. It's definitely one of my favourite games of all time. Hatoful Boyfriend is the epic tale of a hunter-gatherer girl who must go on the adventure of a life time.At first glance, most people have assumed this game is just a silly game about dating pigeons, but if you've actually finished the whole thing you know it's so much more than that. Not only is it filled with a rich history, wonderfully refreshing characters, and a compelling original story, but it knows how to have fun.  I've played quite a few visual novels and dating sims, and I can say that even after you've only played two or three, they can get repetitive fast. No matter how much you like them, it's easy to notice how similar they all are with most characters only existing to fullfill their specific trope. Stories are made as a background for what the game is really about: dating. Hatoful Boyfriend isn't like that. Hatoful Boyfriend takes all the tropes from your average Otome Games and flips them of their heads making a refreshing change in the genre. Have you ever wondered why you'll fail in so many games if you don't date any of the guys? Hatoful Boyfriend explains it. All the characters have strong personalities and they don't feel so stale and one-dimensional. Sure, there's the shy quiet one and the obnoxious popular type, but there's so much more to it than that and every replay doesn't feel like a waste of time as you're actually learning more and more about the world they live in.Every tiny detail with each of the endings makes you more and more curious as to what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on. The humour and absolute strangeness will bring you in, but the complex storytelling and interesting characters will keep you playing until the end. These pigeons aren't here just to be weird and make sales. They exist for a reason. They exist for a fully devoloped and well thought out reason and it's absolutely worth buying and playing to find out what that reason is first hand. I promise you'll be pleasantly surprised."

Not a thing that I'm particularly proud of but I became quite good at it. I was taking zinc supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. first, you need to find an isolated spot so you don't become a sex offender. I found a short kind of channel area where I saw the pigeons would congregate. Next, you arouse yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a♥♥♥♥♥♥on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if you're not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go.  After you're good an horny, you get some bread. My pigeons preferred white bread but healthier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain. Fat, unhealthy birds are slower and easier to hit so remember that. Once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed, whip your roosevelt out and scatter bread out within a few feet of you. use your judgement based on how far you know you can♥♥♥♥♥ I was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a thimble at distances up to 4 feet.

Radical political parties, genocide, experimentation, biological warfare, murder, pudding--just to name a few--are all themes you'll encounter in this game.You are a human transfer student in a school specifically for birds. Unbeknownst to you, your mission is to woo every bird in the school, albeit one at a time in separate playthroughs. Each bird has different interests, personalities, and backstories, but the more you play, the more you'll realize that they're all intertwined, and that there's something terribly sinister going on at your school behind the scenes. Once you've seduced every bird and achieved every ending, you are rewarded with a chance to ""fulfill the promise,"" and solve a mystery that will leave you on the edge of your seat for hours.Hatoful Boyfriend is beyond deceptive in its marketing as a joke, and I hadn't expected that it would tell a wonderfully written story that would leave me in tears at its end.--My only gripe about Hatoful Boyfriend is the spotty save system, as so many others seem to have issues with, too. I would occasionally need to load a save only to find that it would load a background without characters, text, or interface, forcing me to Alt+F4 to leave the game. The save file was forever corrupted, and I would have to restart that particular storyline. The dating playthroughs are short enough to finish in single sittings, but the finale can take hours to finish. I would recommend playing the finale only if you know you have a lot of free time ahead of you, at least until the save issues are fixed. I will amend this review should they be resolved.Oh, and the occasional typo or missing word, but that's not a big deal.--Have fun, everybirdie!"

Click. Click. Some come with complications and conspiracies which add to the entertainment value. This visual novel breaks the 4th wall in humorous satirey way. But it also deals with some pretty adult/heavy issues that were pretty unexpected.  It takes about an hour to playthrough and has replay value as you pursue all available birds. And if you playthrough all possible endings you can play a rather dark bonus level. No longer a dating simulation, but now a in depth look at the world in which this visual novel takes place.

,Recommended,310080,12003446,"Posted: 6 September, 2014",all,Epsilon,"Hatoful Boyfriend is the visual novel that got me to start reading visual novels a few years ago, and along with Katawa Shoujo, showed me how genuinely well written they can be. With the absurd premise of dating talking, oversized birds in a high school called St. Pigeonation's, you'd be forgiven for assuming that game was entirely parodical. Yet the stories of characters such as Nageki and Ryouta become genuine tearjerkers towards their conclusions, and the game gradually unlocks more sinister stories as you go, with Iwamine Shuu's being the darkest of all normal routes by far, with some very creepy overtones and disturbing implications.Then you complete enough routes to unlock the ""Bad Boys Love"" (I have no idea why it was called this) mode, which is incredibly difficult to discuss without massive spoilers, but what I can tell you is that not only does its own story go to very dark places, but it gives every other route far darker implications in retrospect.Hatoful Boyfriend's sequel, ""Holiday Star"", was released awhile back on DLSite, and is not a dating sim in any respect. Its main story is almost entirely linear, but it is hilarious and absurd, featuring such nonsense as fangirl powered cannons. Like the original game, its story gets much darker later on. It also dials back the dating sim elements to unlockable extra scenes that are accessed through the main menu.If you can enjoy, or even just get past, the premise of this game, then I wholeheartedly recommend it, because the worst it can be is a cheap laugh. If you give it a chance, you'll find that it's far more than that.In addition, the Steam release upgrades the game to 1080p with some very nice, crisp artwork - although the bird pictures look even more out of place now - and adds some additional content in the form of a route for the awesome Azami. Its Collector's Edition is also a good deal with 2 silly wallpapers, the soundtrack, a copy of the original DLSite version of the game, a Hatoful Boyfriend manga and a ""yearbook"" artbook of the game."

,Recommended,310080,30249950,Posted: 28 February,all,Selenography,"Bought it expecting lame puns and not much else. Seven hours later and I'm contemplating getting the DLC. How did this happen to me? How do you even review this game? Even without the bizarre premise, it isn't exactly your ordinary dating VN. Hatoful Boyfriend honestly deserves plaudits just for skirting the blender of meme-game shovelware with a setting like this, let alone producing a convincingly authentic VN with a twist.Let's get it out of the way. Yes, you are a human at a school for birds. The only human. You'd expect this to be handwaved and rarely referred to, right? Bzzzt, wrong. The plot is actually far deeper than anticipated; the real cherry atop this game is the BBL route at the end, which radically alters the tone and veers in a far darker direction than the main game. Themes include: murder, suicide, rejection, dystopia, genocide and human experimentation. Yeah. Seriously grim at times, it manages to combine Sherlock and Under the Dome in fleshing out the main cast far beyond where the main game takes them.Before all that, the main game is actually pretty pleasant. The...birds...are characterised surprisingly deftly, and avoiding the common VN pitfall of nailing one identifiable trait to a character and bludgeoning you over the head with it at every opportunity. These guys are genuinely sympathetic, and each route generally avoids too much repetition beyond the first semester. Your avatar is pretty funny, and seems to channeling her inner Mongol about half the time, as she studies in class and makes choices regarding the secret lives of birds. The foreshadowing for the final route is subtly done.Even if the Bad Boys Love route didn't exist, I'd still be rating this positively...it's a solid VN, funny and polished. The end route only elevates Hatoful Boyfriend considerably above most peers, and was a refreshing departure from the usual themes in dating sims. A murder-mystery whodunnit tacked onto a game about romancing pigeons - why not?"

,Recommended,310080,18564856,"Posted: 19 October, 2015",all,Bakeneko,"TL;DR: My favorite visual novel game, period. I consider it a must-play for VN/otome fans.---Overall Impression: It took me awhile to get past, ""Oh, Japan... dating birds?"" to try it out. I had resolved I'd heard enough to give it a go, but it took watching Dodger's (presshearttocontinue) Let's Play to actually buy it. It made me laugh and it made me genuinely cry. It's probably best if you are familiar with otome game tropes, but a good background in anime/manga might do to pick up on all the jokes. Even if you only come at the game for the ""weirdness"", I hope you stay to see its real charm.Content: Don't get me wrong - Hatoful Boyfriend may be silly and weird and cute on the surface and once you dig past it, well, it'sstillsilly and weird... But it also brushes along some really dark and heavy stuff. The list that follows will contain content spoilers, though if you have issues, it's better to have mild spoilers than be upset.SPOILERS: There is violence. Death - lots of death. War. Genocide. Murder (including of children). Suicide.Translation: I think the translation is fantastic.Editing: A few very minor issues, but overall, I had no complaints. I can't even remember any specific issues.Art: Let's get real here... there's really not a lot of ""art"" here! Unlike many VNs, there are no ""event"" CGs. Each character really gets one sprite with no changes of expression and the human portrait you see onceifyou turn on the human portrait option. In the end, it honestly adds to the absurdity, so I have no complaints. The backgrounds are pretty gorgeous, though. And the ending slates are really cute. The artist has done comics with the gang and sometimes does artwork of the characters, which she posts to her Tumblr and Deviantart accounts. If you want art, check those things out, because they're great!Story: On the surface, you're sold on, ""Oh, Japan!"" - just the absurd premise of a human girl going to a school for intelligent birds and falling in love with one of the birdie boyfriends available in typical ""school romance"" style.You dig a little deeper and you see the tropes being made fun of (gently, and with love).Then you start caring about these ""dumb birds"".Then you're hit with something heavy. If you get to the point of caring, it's pretty much guaranteed it'll hurt. The author skillfully manipulates you to this point and I admire her greatly for it.I honestly find myself at a loss to describe the story in any other way. I don't really see the birds as ""bachelors to be wooed"", though technically they are. They are, however, characters to fall in love with, and I do. I love every one of them, faults and all.The Heroine: She's kind of a meathead, honestly! (The creator also uses a cartoon piece of meat to represent her in the comics.) She's weird and maybe not entirely bright on the surface - but she's probably much smarter than she lets on. She definitely has a personality of her own! (She just has no official character design!) There's something subversive about her that the more I get to know her, the more I appreciate her.In closing...I really, really hope you pick it up. I enjoyed it enough I own the Collector's Edition (something I wouldn't necessarily recommend at full price unless you're already a fan - the comic and yearbook aren't that many pages). I also own all the comics and the sequel game, Holiday Star, from purchasing them from the creator's homepage. I'll also be purchasing a new copy of Holiday Star when it it comes to Steam. I'm a super fan! Complete with fanart! It's often on discount, but even at full price is cheap for such a great game.EDIT: Just adding that Holiday Star is out on Steam and I hope you pick it up too!"

Sure the whole ""I'm a human going after birds, what the ♥♥♥♥ is up with this beastiality?"" thing might come over you. But put that aside.  I was the same way when i first heard about the game a few years back. Then I decided to play one route and then put it down. With this steam release, I actually went through and decided to see all the endings. And the stories are amazing. The writing is funny, and had me laughing through my first few playthroughs. But down certain routes, when things got serious, the writing was well done (aside from the occasional typo, which there aren't too many of) and had me sucked into the scene, while I clung to my seat thighter with every word I read.  The soundtrack is amazing, and it makes me wish I had've gotten the collector's edition so I could've gotten it.  Overall, it's a great story with a weird twist to it in the form of birds, but if you can put that aside, there's a great time to be had going through Hatoful Boyfriend."

It started out that way. Then sh*t got real. It was not fun. It was not light-hearted. Your boyfriends turn out to be dead, or pudding-deities, or too old, or mad scientists. A lot of them leave you in the end, or decide to keep your brain in a jar. Yet I still found it oddly intriguing, and found dating fictional pigeons to be much more enjoyable than dating fictional humans.My only real problem with the game is that they never tell you if the pigeons you're dating are normal sized pigeons, or giant human sized pigeons. That mystery really hindered my ability to properly visualize many parts of the story."

,Recommended,310080,33362181,Posted: 7 July,all,bird on skateboard,"My wife passed away in 2013. It was a very difficult time for me and my wife's son. I was working long hours and trying to raise my baby daughter. My wife's son was just entering high school. Life was hitting both of us hard. He was depressed most of the time. His grades started falling that year. I couldn't spend all too much time with him because of work. I had to stay at the office late most nights to pay for the nanny for my baby daughter. I bought him a playstation earlier that year. I was always into games, and I got the feeling he liked games too. He had a ds which he liked to play Kirby on. While I could never find the time to game, my coworker Jeff would always tell me about the current gems. He got me to buy my wife's son Little Big Planet. Jeff would always talk to me about Japanese visual novels. He told me about the brilliant dialogue and character choices. I thought about buying one for my wife's son, but he was still only 14 and he was still performing poorly in school. One day, Jeff started chatting me up about a new visual novel that had come out- Hatoful Boyfriend. Right before Christmas (my wife's son is 15 now) I decided to buy it for my wife's son. He was thrilled and surprised. He had never had an VN. He told me he had played one once at a friends house but that was it. He rarely went to friends' houses anymore. That Christmas I got a raise at work. I spent the holiday relaxed with my kids. I was initially concerned when I saw all the racism, crude language, violence, and sexual content in the game. The game even opened to a scene of the player being late to school, which I certainly didn't want my wife's son to emulate! On top of that, the game was very difficult. My wife's son often made me trade off with him, but I did not do much better. The Iwamine romance route was a deathwish! I had a little get-together on New Years and had some friends over and I used it as an opportunity for Jeff to help my wife's son and I in the game. I had to get back to work, but mywife's  son's break from school hadn't ended yet. He stayed home and gamed while I sat at work and day-dreamed about St. Pigeonation's Institute. I managed to find most of the songs from the game and I would listen to them on my computer at work. 静寂の海, 散り逝くなら、いっそ残酷に, and 過ぎ去りし日々 were and still are my favorites. At night when I would get home, we would eat dinner as a family and he would give me updates. We would smile and laugh and talk about some more adult themes. I found this game to be a great way to bond with my wife's son. The week ended and my wife's son went back to school. I told the nanny to try to help him manage his time with the game and homework. She made me pay her extra for that. At the end of the year, my wife's son brought home his report card. All A's second semester! I was so proud of him. I would later buy him Hatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star, and I would find more time to spend with my wife's son and daughter. My wife's son continued to do good in school. In Senior Year, he got a job. I would help him buy new games, but he made his own money. He would have friends over and they would all play the new Nekopara. I gave him my car in 2016. He said it was the happiest day of his life. My wife's son is in college now. He calls me regularly. I help to pay for his needs, but he still has his old high school job. Now I try to spend quality time with my daughter. She is very smart and pretty. I've never missed one of her soccer games. She is very popular so she is always saying the night at her friends house. I eat dinner by myself, but I smile as I sit at our dinner table and I remember feeding my daughter, sitting on my lap, while my wife's son talks to be about the Bad Boy's Love ending. After dinner, I sit at my computer and play Hatoful Boyfriend. It is the best game ever made. Maybe if PigeoNation makes another Hatoful Boyfriend game, I can have my wife's son over again."

You get attached to the characters with their stories so deep with emotions it's like The Walking Dead (game) + The Last of Us + Okami + Okamiden + Every Other Game That Gives You The Feels. I'm very glad that this game has been remastered and put on Steam, I was oringally going to buy the orinigal version, but then I heard of the remastered version and I was like ""Here's my money!""I'd give this game a 9.5/10:Pros: great story, heartwarming characters, beautiful soundtrack, birdy puns, rememerable characters, the idea that Okosan is awesome everytime you Hear ""pudding"", plus there's manga sidestories (that are on Amazon!)Cons: too short, text misspellings and grammar issues here and there, and too many people say ""Ugh! Weird Japenese dating sim!""Either way, this game is awesome, I recommend everyone to buy the collectors edition for $15, trust me, you won't regret it."

You date all the birds, get all the endings. Pretty run of the mill for a dating sim. But then the game comes out and asks you to fulfill a promise. This is the BBL ending, or Bad Boy's Love. This is when the game switches from Otome dating sim to murder mystery psycological horror. I won't spoil it, but if thought some of the normal endings were dark, this blows them right out of the water. The characters develop greatly during the course of BBL and many questions are answered, so its worth playing however.I would greatly recommend this to any visual novel fan and also would be a great starting point to people wanting to get into the series. It has a suprising amount of depth for a game like this and shouldn't be taken at face value. So yeah. Buy it."

Its embrace of the absurd was a refreshing break from standard dating sim fare.Storywise, underneath the lighthearted, ridiculous exterior, there's a lot more to the plot and the world of Hatoful Boyfriend than meets the eye. My first playthrough was amusing, but as I played again to get more endings, more details about the game's overarching story were revealed. Making new discoveries about the plot became genuinely rewarding, and by the time I got all the endings it felt like a whole different game.As far as gameplay goes there's not much to say; it's purely a dating sim. The best part of the interface was the skip button, which makes replays take 5-10 minutes max instead of 30 minutes. Overall a fun game with great replay value, would recommend to anyone who likes dating sims, visual novels, and surreal games."

,Recommended,310080,29683198,Posted: 3 February,all,ʄǟռƈɦʏ ɮօɨ,"I had originally written this review on my page over a year ago. I had not beaten the game, yet I wrote a review on how it was cute and charming. After 100% completion, I MUST update it. While on the outside, Hatoful Boyfriend is just a game where you date birds, it is SO MUCH MORE! The core mechanics are those of a dating game, but every single storyline is so complete and emotion-jerking, it's insane. There are 15 endings to this game. The first 14 require you to complete the game by romancing each bird, some have true endings, where their story is given a proper conclusion, and you understand a little more about them. If you pick up this game, I do not highly recommend completing all of these 14 endings, I URGE YOU TO COMPLETE THEM. If you must look up a guide to beat them, then so be it, but they are all so incredibly amazing, and not one is a waste of time. Once you have completed these 14 endings, you will be able to complete the 15th, and final ending. Highlight over this area if you would like a semi-spoilery explanation, I won't say the story, and what happens, but I will say why you should complete all the stories in this game, here goes :Once you have completed the stories for all the characters, you are able to progress and complete the final story. This story will take the longest amount of time, as it is separated into 10 or so chapters. You will uncover every birds proper backstory through playing all the stories, you will be able to feel like you have just watched the most intense movie of your life. You will be plagued with mystery and anxiety, wonder and curiousity, and most of all, awe. It is absolutely incredible how JPEG images of birds with text boxes can make you feel such intense emotion. So once you're done with the first 14 stories of Hatoful Boyfriend, why not delve into the 15th story, and experience BBL. You won't regret it.This is one of the only games I have ever 100% completed, and with valid reason. This game was so compelling. Even if you're doing 1 story a night, or binge playing through the whole thing (average completion time maybe around 10 hours), you won't regret playing this game, and through it's stories. If you start it, I must request that you properly finish it. Please. You will not regret it."

It's hard to explain to people who haven't got a clue about it what makes it just so magical. Yes, you are dating pigeons. Yes, that sounds very crazy. But it's so much more than that! The thing that really gets me about this game is how each playthrough with each character allows you to learn more and more about how the situation you're in came to be, both personally and on a global scale. Hato Moa really carefully planned every detail out, put love and care into this whole thing and it shows. There are so many emotions in this game; I laughed, was confused, touched, felt the love and cried. Boy did I cry. This game is a journey and one I can't recommend highly enough.

Of course, that much is obvious from the very premise of the game: a dating sim involving pigeons! What really made Hatoful for me was how weird and/or creepy a lot of the endings were, especially the ""true ending"" in the form of the ""Bad Boys' Love""/Hurtful Boyfriend path that you unlock after achieving certain normal endings. I never expected to get this freaked-out by a game about dating pigeons! And on the happier side, Okosan's and Anghel's routes are amusingly weird, each in their own way. Still, some of the standard routes - including Ryouta's, Kazuaki's and Sakuya's, ones you need to achieve the BBL ending - are typical otome game stuff and don't have much to offer beyond that. But they're worth suffering through to get to the quality routes and to learn more about Hatoful's distinctive post-apocalyptic world. Give it a whirl even if you're not a VN fan."

Yet, Hatoful Boyfriend seemed like it was going to really appeal to the masses through a bit of satire, parody and commentary. I guess it does do that in a way, if not much, which is probably why it's had a radiating but mild success in other demographics. But I expected more, like some more gameplay, or branching interactions to really throw the competitors of the genre in the mud since they rely only on horrible anime pseudo porn. If it were to be a great parody AND to also include some legit gameplay, animations or more story depth and length, to really show others how to really make an interesting 'dating' sim at the same time would have elevated it to a great GAME, not some cheap feeling visual novella with around 10 input screens.Hatoful Boyfriend on the surface seems to only jest at the dialog of the genre in a very absurd  'lol dating games amirite?!' sort of way. Sure, some of the writing is silly, a bit fun, sometimes humorous and sometimes dark. But that's all you get, it still feels like i'm just playing an odd dating simulator after a few playthroughs.  Call me crazy but if there was a hint of a descent into madness, I would have liked to have seen a glimpse of it within the first hour of playing so I would be enticed to keep on digging deeper.Maybe I was expecting something along the lines of The Stanley Parable or (more hoping) Frog Fractions from what I heard from other people. But alas it doesn't. If it does, however, devolve into an exciting madness, I did not get that impression during my time playing.As a side note: It would have been nice to remember your username each time you played through but this is just nitpicking.Anyway, maybe I'm wrong about the whole thing and everything I said actually exists and things get crazy and engaging or even quite long. But it never seems to, and it never did.It's a shame really, I hope someone does revisit this type of game again and really make it into something odd, slick and compelling."

I was excited to prove my friend, having declined my offer of gifting this game, wrong, because I thought this would be a game on par with others with a unique and funny background. Unfortunately, it really has no poetic language, no charm, and no depth to the writing style. It is simply indicative in all instances, stating what happens and who does something. The main character is a typical girl and writes typically. There's no philosophical dialogue, and barely even character insight.It gets the job done, but I don't like the job it is doing. The task of quickly showing 2 minute scenes, switching between random choices and introducing a too-large amount of birds so quickly innundates any reader which is attempting to read at a normal or fast pace.I really want to iterate this. Each scene lasts a matter of minutes.Five minutes would be a very long event in this game.The scenery is okay. No places seem to be visited enough to be memorable past the Cafe and the main character's home.

,Not Recommended,310080,16591081,"Posted: 21 June, 2015",all,Soundwave MD,"This game resonated with me about as much as RoboGeisha and Vampire Girl vs. Frankenstein Girl. To be blunt, it's a bit too weird to have a human character romance birds. That was the first issue.The real problem, though, in my opinion, is that this game is not interesting enough to play through the countless endings. Not only do you have to click through reams of text that you have already read several times, but you get to listen to the same handful of music loops, enjoy only the occasional choice, and see the same image for every character, regardless of where they are or what they are doing.I would be able to look past all of this if I found the jokes, plot, or characters worth the extra clicks. Heck, I used to enjoy playing flash RPGs several times in a row to both try new choices and enjoy the experience. I was hoping for a game that was chock-full of hilarious bird puns with maybe some nonsensical mischief and breaking of the fourth wall. In short, I expected this game to keep me in stitches.However (and I know this is strange to say about a bird dating simulator), the writing in this game is just not very memorable. Most of the jokes fall flat, the characters are unrelatable, and the overall story is lackluster. Perhaps if I got this game when I was younger I would have been able to enjoy it; as it is, this experience has reminded me that just because so many others have enjoyed a game does not mean I would.If you are into manga or want another joke game to give to/play with your friends, then buy Hatoful Boyfriend on sale. Otherwise, save the money."

,Recommended,310080,13857189,"Posted: 5 January, 2015",all,Phoenix,"I'll admit, I bought Hatoful Boyfriend because it's a game with birds, and Phoenix likes pretty much anything bird-related.  I kept reading snippets about how it's a really great game, and I caught it on sale and decided to get it on a lark (ha ha).  On the outside, you play the only human female at the world's most prestigious school for gifted birds.  Why you're a human female trying to find romance with birds is explained in the game if you play through all the various endings.  There are several possible story arcs in the game, and depending on which path you take you'll end up either falling in love with a specific bird, or have a completely unexpected turn of events.  Some endings are completely off the wall, others might be bittersweet.  That's just the surface though.  After completing enough of the correct story arcs, you'll unlock a much different story arc that provides backstory to all the characters and goes in a completely unexpected direction.  The story telling at that point is absolutely superb.As for how the game is played, it's basically in the format of a click-through novel with various choices.  The visuals are static backgrounds with static character graphics, and due to the nature of the game needing to be replayed, a lot of the narrative can become redundant.  There is a ""fast forward"" button that allows you to skip ahead between decision points.  There's a ""stat"" system that keeps track of your wisdom, vitality, and charisma based on what classes you choose and how you interact in certain situations.  These may look meaningless at first, but depending on which story path you choose they DO matter.The pros:It has birds.  You like birds right?There's a lot of obvious parody and downright silliness.It's simple to play.  No fancy controls, no real learning curve.The music is fantastic.The characters are unique and interesting.This is NOT a ""dating"" sim.  Romance plays an element, but there's a much deeper story line.It's not very expensive.There's no sexual content.  It's clean.The extended storyline is extremely well thought through and intricate.The cons:Playing through each storyline can get a little tedious.Some endings require you to have certain stats either high or low, and it's not obvious as to which.The lack of animation and static nature of the graphics will be a turn-off to some.There are some spelling and grammar errors that should have been caught.The simplistic nature of the interface and the fact that it's more of a ""choose your own adventure""-style novel and completely lacks any real skill element will be unattractive to people with short attention spans.There are some much darker elements that, if you're expecting just a light-hearted silly game, might catch you off-guard.Obiously this is not a game for everyone, but Phoenix likes it, so take a look and decide for yourself.One last note:  A lot of males will wonder, ""Ok, I'm a dude, why should I play this when it looks so girly?""  If you're of a mature intellect and you're comfortable with your gender identity, that should not scare you away.  This is not a ""girly"" game.  That's part of the parody aspect.  In addition, your character - not you - is the one the events happen to.  This character has her own thoughts and actions in the narrative.  You're just guiding her decisions.  Keep that in mind if you're on the fence."

I simply did not understand what was going on here and I needed to know more.There are a few different things going on here, and I'm not entirely compelled by any of them. There's the joke on date simulators - this is entertaining for a brief period of time. There's some wacky and unexpectedly great writing - this is interesting for a few hours. Then the story really gets going... and going... and going. While it was interesting to explore the full potential of the cast of characters and the setting I left the game feeling a bit like the joke was on me - my time had been wasted.I suppose part of my frustration comes to the Save Game feature intermittently working, causing my final run of the story get tiresome as I was unable to really leave it for another day. Perhaps I lost track of the different Japanese names that, at times, chop and change? Perhaps it's the lack of any actual branching choices in the last segment of the game that left it feeling shallow (from a 'game' point of view)?Hatoful Boyfriend is an interesting exercise but definitely not a game I'd recommend. Perhaps it's a game for a certain type of person - and not me."

,Recommended,310080,12070516,"Posted: 12 September, 2014",all,rosemask22,"A great game for those who love the dating sim genre and a good game for those who don't.Hatoful Boyfriend is a parody dating sim where instead of romancing other people, you romance birds. The routes for each of the birds are fairly short compared to other dating sims out there but they are all funny and enjoyable (and some downright bizarre). However, if you're looking for a lot of romance, then I wouldn't say this game is for you. While there is romance in some routes, it is mainly left to the readers imagination after the route is finished. I would say though, that if you are a fan of dating sims and otome games, you will probably get more out of the game as it parodies stereotype characters found in a lot of typical dating sims.Even if you aren't a huge fan of dating sims, I would recommend the game alone for the alternative story which contrasts greatly to the main game (and is a lot longer than the average route). The alternative story answers all the mysteries hinted at in the main game and gives a explanation to why you are the only human in a school for birds. Let me just say, if you're a fan of mysteries and thrillers you will probably like this part.I actually bought the deluxe edition, which features: the soundtrack (36 tracks), the original game (in english), a ten page manga with 4koma strips and some illustrations (in both Japanese and English), two Okosan wallpapers and a 35 page yearbook, featuring pictures of the backgrounds and characters. While the extra stuff is great, I don't think I would pay full price for the deluxe pack. However, if you are a big fan of the series and the original game it might be worth it."

That's literally the most apt description I can give this game. You start out as a lovely young sophomore enrolling in the prestigious St. Pigeonation high school, and then you get to hit on a bunch of birds. I haven't played through to get all of the endings yet, but the two (three counting the time I died) I have gotten...Wow. Just wow. This...This game really knows how to do a comical game. And then suddenlythe guy (pigeon? I don't know the term for a male pigeon) you've been dating's mother just dies. And also there are beans and pigeons in dresses and it's just generally very silly.

Either way, I expected nothing more than a dumb, silly, lighthearted bird-dating sim. Oh jeez, this game was more than that.Following the routes of each bird is pretty short and nothing too special. The dialogue gets silly, and it appears to be exactly what I expected, aside from two very entertaining dating paths (Oko-San's and Anghel's).However, wooing enough of the birds unlocks the ""BBL ending"" which provides an entertaining story that has nothing to do with flirting, and everything to do with character development - and with content that is dark, twisted, and answers some of the questions left by playing through the dating paths. I finished this plot somewhere between two / two and a half hours, and it was worth it. Unlike the individual dating paths, which tend to gloss over the characters and sometimes leave unsatisfying endings, the BBL plot throws a ton of additional background story into each character, a bunch of twists, and is written well enough to make you want to finish playing through it. The BBL plot plays more as an interactive story than a sim, but for a few bucks I'd say it's worth it.Overall, the 'preliminary game' is alright but nothing too special, and each path is quite short. The BBL plotline is great and makes it worth playing through to unlock."
,Not Recommended,310080,18173811,"Posted: 24 September, 2015",all,Allthegoodnamestaken,"It has its momements, but there aren't enough of them to justify $10. Some of the main endings are funny, but you have to trudge through the same year 7 times to see them all, with *many* events repeating each time and a skip function that doesn't stop for unread text. They take 15-30 minutes each depending on your use of said skip button, and several are obnoxiously set up so that you have to go back and do everything again (but only veeeery slightly differently) in order to get a second version of the ending that's exactly the same except that it cuts to the credits earlier.And doing that is actually necessary to see everything - the final ending doesn't unlock until you've seen the other 13. That ending has the most to offer in terms of storytelling, but it drags on for far, far, longer than it ever needed to because of an obsession with repeatedly retelling the same events from perspectives that are minimally different. I started out thinking it was the highlight of the game and really should've been there from the start, but by the end I was just mashing space to make it end. There weren't any repurcussions to that approach, because this part of the game is also completely impossible to lose and provides zero choices with any impact over the course of two hours. That branch desperately needed an editor, and not just because of length - there's one part that has a sentence so badly mistranslated that it's completely meaningless.I really wish I could recommend this - I normally love dumb things that wear their stupidity as a badge of honor - but HB ruins itself by simultaneously being too short to feel meaningful and too long for the joke to stay funny. On sale, it's probably worthwhile to see an ending or two, (again, a few of the main ones are legitimately funny) but there's just not enough here for $10. It isn't bad, but I was much more entertained by reading about the original version years ago than I was actually playing the remake. Oh well."

Its narrative is not to be taken seriously, however there is a story path that takes it to a whole new level. Hurtful Boyfriend is a route, unlocked by playing other routes, and its story is so different compared to the rest of the game. It explains why Shuu is such a creeper. It explains why Yuuya wants to connect with Sakuya. It explains why Nageki lives in the library. It goes deep into Kazuaki's quirky persona and the secrets inside. Although I wouldnt reccomend it if ur just looking for laughs. Its a serious sub-plot (even a bit scary at times) and might ruin the way u see this game.But Im honestly so glad its on steam for everyone to play.

The game is aThe art and music have their own flaws. Some of the art isn't super great (the backgrounds can be a little blotchy) and the music is just classic cheesy dating sim stuff, but it's all pretty decent anyway. You can play without the music and not miss anything, as there are no voice actors for the birds.Hatoful Boyfriend offers a unique amount of replayability. You can die, you can get two endings with some of the birds, and as you progress through the game through each bird's uniquely charming story, you essentially unlock an entirely different game. But keep in mind that after your second or third ending, it gets a bit tedious going through the dialogue. The fast forward button in the top right is your friend for that, but even that will get tedious if you're going for 14 endings. Be patient.This game is a slice of life wrapped up in an outlandish plot and humanistic birds that you can fall in love with. It's fun and it's charming and it's worth spending time and money on."

The obvious quirk to this game doesn't cause the game to get lost in that - the story is still cohesive, the characters are rich, and the world is filled with backstory to be discovered, and content to be explored outside of the game through ""real"" blogs by characters from that world.This game isn't for anyone who can't stand dating sims. On the surface it looks like it's a quirky little game about dating birds, and it is, but if you're not into reading lines and lines of dialogue, having long stretches of time where your only interaction is one line of dialogue, or what class to go to, or replaying over and over, this should be avoided. However, if you're a dating sim fan, or even someone who wants to get into them, this is worth picking up. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and it's a very light experience that's as powerful as you want it to be.10/10 I want to date these birds."

I then played it until I got every ending, and I laughed, and I cried, and I was terrified for my life, all in the same game. I highly reccommend this game because once you get through all of the endings, and you unlock the endgame, it gets really freaking real really freaking fast. For two days (I had classes to go to so I had to turn the game off) I tried getting through all of the endgame, my emotions running rampant and my fear even getting to me.

Don't let the fact you're going through the standard intro yet again bore you into quitting- the story diverges greatly from what you've played, and actually gets very interesting (assuming you can suspend you disbelief at the level the novel asks you to). Yeah, there are a few misspellings and instances of poor grammar (just as with the rest of the game). But, if you're willing to do that, and don't mind linearity, then yes, this is worth the full price. If not...The normal game does a good job deconstructing the high school dating visual novel cliches, and the fact you're a human girl vying for the affections of a bird only adds a bit more humor to it. There's a fast-forward feature that skips to the next day or decision, so replays aren't that painful. My favorite endings in the standard game are the ones for the Fallen Angel, best Track Star, and best Doctor. If you're not willing to go through all the endings and don't want to go through the bonus story, then I'd wait for it to go on sale. If you're more of a completionist, I'll say it again- I was very impressed by the bonus story, and completely taken by surprise that the writers could craft some junkfood for the mind that good. The bonus epilogue isn't that good, so it's up to how much of a completionist you are if you shoot for that as well. But the bonus story is worth the money and the effort of unlocking it."

They also have their own unique backgrounds and you can adore them easily (with the exception of the doctor- I had the unfortunate luck to play Yuuya's before Shuu's and god frick I couldn't -stomach- Shuu's route at all, Yuuya was my second conquest after all :( )-The options are pretty blunt. The protagonist would always say which characters goes with what option, although it might be pretty hard for you first time to actually organize your options for one exact route-The routes are very short (in my opinion, I -am- accustomed to games like hakuouki, whose routes are v e r y long) so this game can easily become a past time if you find yourself doing nothing during a lazy day-The endings are realistic- or as realistic an otome game can get, there's a dash of cliche tucked in there but the ending's can at least satisfy the player (or if not- the calming end credits music always helps, man I love that ost)cons:-The routes are too short for my liking. (Weird, this is -both- a pro and a con? huh) Short routes don't usually immerse the player too much into the story, and I sometimes just find myself playing this game for the achievements alone-There's no compatibility/likeability/love gauge (or whatever you call that) for the characters you're aiming for. You're only going to realize that you've done the right thing if his dialogue is different from the other options, and sometimes not at all. Love gauges are v e r y important in otome games, especially if it's just at the start of the game, so you can know if you're going through the right path, so the player can easily be killed by the hawk's party if without a guide at their first try-It kind of gets repetitive over time until you finally get near the end, when both of you and your conquest are really bonded. I found myself skipping dialogue a lot, making this already short game even shorter-The stats system is very vague, like sure, you'll find yourself passing if you go to math class a lot and meet your conquests a lot more if you take classes associated with them, but suddenly you're faced with a turn based battle with your damage and hp depending on your stats and you wouldn't even realize how important that one class was to this route until you're hit with it with a loud smack, heck, even some endings require attending only one specific class for the whole year, and if you stray even one time from that class, in hopes of balancing your stats, you can say bye to your true endingthat's all I can say for now, but this is a fun game nonetheless, this game is worth the money, although I still recommend waiting for sales if you're tight on the money (this game was just on sale a week ago, and I was so angry because right after I bought it for its full price does steam decide to put it on a 75% sale, I was raging over twt so much)"

As it turns out, this game is actually pretty well-written! There are some corny jokes and puns here and there, but most of the jokes are pretty good! Even when the game is getting more serious, it still manages to be pretty good. There are moments in this game that will actually make you cry, at which point you will notice that you are crying at a pigeon dating sim, and will probably start to question your life choices up until now. This game is THAT good.There are six main love interests (three of which have secret complete endings that can only be achieved after clearing their routes at least once), two extra secret love interests, and a final secret route: BBL.""Bad Boys' Love"", also known as ""Hateful Boyfriend"" or ""Hurtful Boyfriend"", is pretty much the ""endgame"" of this game. You can enter this route before getting all other endings, but i would not recommend doing so. If you clear all other endings beforehand, you get an extra post-credits scene.Now, about BBL's plot itself. I can't tell you much, because of spoilers, but i can say this: it's a murder mystery.Now, you might be thinking ""oh, okay, it's a murder mystery parody, right?""To which i will reply: ""NO.""For, you see, this is actually taken completely serious. And you might think that this is when the game gets sucky, but no, this is THE BEST PART OF THE ENTIRE GAME. It's full of expertly done plot twists, that will make you play through the game again and go ""oh my god, the devs of this pigeon dating sim had planned it all out, ALL ALONG!"".By all means, you MUST get this game if you like VNs.

And so, this date - the afterward of the events that occured - is where we begin, upon a fateful evening where the sunlight is still nigh and I am attempting to write a script for Drama class.I'm looking on Steam with curiosity - could Hatoful Boyfriend be featured on the Summer Sale? A loud gasp escapes my throat and echoes into the distance of the obstacle course-like living room, startling my mother. Indeed, the beloved game in which you can date different species of birds is on sale: for £1.74? This is my chance. It is normally £6.99 and my mother would doubt purchasing such a game. But a dating game about pigeons for £1.74...She requests something before granting me the game and her honest endless respect. My mother looks at me with disrespect, wondering why her fourteen-year-old daughter is playing a dating game - about birds, nonetheless? Ah, she must think that I am insane! It is my goal now to become connected to these birds, draw myself closer to them, bring my life towards them. My mother was correct. This game is the game of an insane man and she is as correct as the daylight's honestly scolding sunlight. We are insane. As our feelings for birds develop all that we desire is indeed the fact that we are human, much like our fated protagonist of HB (inc. Hurtful Boyfriend) and will eventually fall in love with birds, the dominant species when bird flu overtakes. Pray that we will be the few who are immune to the bird flu and we remain as human as possible. It may seem bizarre, but it is simply humane, in our eyes. We do not love humans any more. It is birds all around for each other, one another, and that is how it will remain.We will woo the birds until we are exhausted and our wings will form. Our wings of freedom. Our wings of responisibility. Our wings that defeat all other love unless it regards birds."

,Recommended,310080,17918723,"Posted: 6 September, 2015",all,Merlin the Tuna,"Hatoful Boyfriend takes a fun one-note gag of dating birds and executes it flawlessly, then executes half a dozen other things flawlessly while it's at it. It constantly mixes up its approach, and the result is a story that manages to be hilarious, goofy as all hell, but also legitimately touching.Ultimately, playing Hatoful is something of a question of sincerity. Yes, the world and story are totally bananas. But the game's willingness to change tone on a dime and play things completely straight leads to no small number of poignant moments. The world of St. Pigeonation's is absurd, but is it really any more absurd than the latest tale of heroic space marines, robo-Nazis, or godlike gangsters? Not really, and at some point, after dealing with characters that act, talk, hope, and fear just like people, you're going to stop caring that their portrait is a ridiculous looking bird. And then, just when you start to get a little emotional, it's going to hit you in the face with another pie.If there's a downside, it's that the actual gameplay can get a little tedious. A huge chunk of the game doesn't open up until you've romanced all of the birds, and a few of the birds have ""normal"" vs. ""perfect"" endings that make for two near-identical playthroughs. So after a few times through, you'll want to pull up a guide (and thankfully there are some good ones) and make judicious use of the fast-forward button to breeze through repeat content. I promise it's worth it, though."

,Recommended,310080,16887163,"Posted: 4 July, 2015",all,Frozen Fireball,"All that can be said about how bizarre the premise is has already been brought up in other reviews, so I'm just going to skip right to the real question; is this game worth buying?Pros:-The story is surprisingly deep.  Once you get over how strange it is, it's a fascinating world, and even though you only see part of it, it feels like there's a lot more going on out there.-The characters all have their own unique personalities; it's difficult to find yourself bored by them.  My least favorite route was still interesting enough for me to enjoy.-Lots of replay value.  Each route that you take reveals a little more about the world, which, as I mentioned above, is quite fascinating.  Be sure to play again after getting all the endings.  It's definitely worth it.-This story has both a great sense of humor, and a surprisingly good sense of drama.  Stick with it to the end, and I can almost guarantee that you will have shed at least a single tear over these characters.-This is the only game of its kind, so I can say in no uncertain terms that this is the best pigeon dating simulation on the market.Cons:-The save feature is totally broken.  You're going to want to play through an entire route in one sitting, because loading a game won't actually work about half the time.  The game itself doesn't take THAT long, so it isn't a total deal-breaker, but it's probably one of the most frustrating things about the game.-Despite the replay value, you're going to find yourself sitting through the same dialogue over and over again.  Each route has its own unique dialogue, too, but there are scenes that happen in every single playthrough regardless of your choices.  Mitigated somewhat by the fast forward button, but then you might end up missing some new dialogue by mistake.  That, and the fast forward still isn't that fast when you're sitting through the intro for the umpteenth time.-If I remember correctly, three characters have both a normal and a true ending, and - unless by some incredibly stroke of luck, the save feature is actually working correctly for you - you're going to have to play through the exact same route making only slight alterations to your stat choices to get both.  I ended up getting the true ending for two out of the three the first time I played, so I ended up spending two entire, tedious games fast-forwarding through dialogue I'd already seen.  It would be a little forgivable if the endings were actually different, but the ""true"" ending is just the same exact ending with a single short, extra scene tacked on.  This is unnecessary padding; I wish they'd just count it as both endings if you got the true ending the first time.Conclusion: This game has a fantastic story told through bits and pieces in various playthroughs, and a great sense of humor.  Endings range from predictable to totally out of left field.  You'll probably have a favorite pigeon by the end of it all.  Mine is Shuu.  :D  Still, fun as it is, it isn't without its flaws.  There IS content you can only unlock by getting all of the endings, and as I said, that can be a tedious process.  This content is well, WELL worth the effort, though; I can promise you that much.  Just make sure to use all the save slots in your final playthrough, since it's rather long, and if you have to quit in the middle of it, you don't want to put all your eggs in one basket.  In my experience, a save is more likely to work if a bird portrait isn't on screen behind it at the time, but that could just be a fluke.  Good luck with that.  ^^'  Anyway, I have to recommend this game, but do keep those issues in mind.  If you can, get the normal endings before the perfect ones so you'll at least have some new content to look forward to at the end of the second run."

The positives of this game cannot be over-stated, and though it may start a little rough, it will quickly fly its way into your heart.Positives+Engaging and distinctive characters with branching story paths that encourage multiple playthroughs.+Tremendous writing that gradually sets up the strange, comedic, and dark world that you (the protagonist) is residing in.+Multiple endings and characters, including some secret ones!+Puns... So many puns...+Great music selection that excellently promotes the tense, calm, and (most importantly) romantic moments that you'll be experiencing with the birds.Negatives-During the ""courting"" section of the game, you'll be asked to pick from a variety of seeds to give to your feathered lover. While you'll eventually learn the different preferences, the game offers no clear explanation of which bird likes what, and it often will turn into a guessing game.-A similar complaint appears with the ""skill raising"" portions that occur during regular parts of the game. It's not really made clear (except in obvious cases) what skills will help most with a specific bird. As with the first negative, this turns the game into ""trial and error"", something I don't enjoy in any game.Taken as a complete package, Hatoful Boyfriend is an amazing game, even if you're not a fan of the typical ""Japanese dating sim"" genre. A memorable and diverse cast of characters, deep storylines filled with comedy, tragedy, and romance, and the environment that the game creates are good enough reasons to overlook the ""trial and error"" portions that initially slow it down. All in all, Hatoful Boyfriend is a tremendous game, and deserves to be given a chance, if only for its sheer creativity and the opportunity to drown the world in pudding."

I started off not expecting too much, since visual novels aren't my thing and I figured it was pretty much a just dating sim parody filled with bird puns. It is a dating sim parody filled with bird puns, but it's also much more.See, visual novels aren't my type because I'd rather have storyline mixed with more effort on my part than just clicking, but I think this was done really well. Your choices throughout the game are quite obvious as to whatever bird the decision would earn you favor with. However, the storyline is fleshed out. Like, really fleshed out. I don't have experience with dating sims but I can tell this one has a lot more going on than usual, despite the obvious fact that they're birds.So the storyline seems pretty out there at first. You're an unquestioned human girl at a school for birds, in a city of birds. You can date the birds. Or, if you don't court a bird properly, you'llbe murdered in your home in the middle of the night. Anyway, as you date these birds, you get a story out of each of them. Your sickly best friend, the stand-offish french transfer student, the eccentric track captain, the narcoleptic teacher, the quiet freshman, the flirty upperclassman, the bone-chilling school doctor, and the bizarre fallen angel are all choices where you can find love. However, once you've gone through the game a few times, the start screen informs you that instead of playing the regular game, you can choose to fulfill a promise from long ago... which pulls you into the ending that ties all their stories togetherinto a tale of how the world is post apocalyptic after scientists tried to wipe out birds that had deadly bird flu and had it backfire, mutating the birds which then gained the intelligence to retaliate against humankind. If you want to know more than that, seriously, just buy it. It should be noted that I started the endgame expecting it to be 15 minutes long then found myself finishing it at 3 AM that night.The mechanics are simple, gameplay surprisingly isn't too slow for my tastes, and even though parts can feel slow after you've played dating a few birds, you can fast forward through parts.If you have the time and the patience for something slow going but interesting, please do yourself a favor and buy this game. Do it for the birds."

I mean, on the surface all you see is a Visual Novel and Dating Sim where almost all the characters are birds.  The normal reaction to that is to say ""...uh, wait.  What?""  But after you spend some time in the game, getting to know the characters and the world the whole bird thing just kind of shifts off to the side.  Your brain starts to think of it as normal.  I'm not really sure why, if it is because of the clever writing, the wonderfully crafted characters, or if I'm  just weird.  The most interesting thing about Hatoful Boyfriend however is that it manages to scratch every single itch a player would have when it comes to a Visual Novel type experience.  Did you want something light hearted and funny?  There is a path for that.  Did you want something super creepy?  Hey, we got a path for that too.  How about something epic and grand complete with a throw back reference to old school JRPGs and some rocking tunes?  You know what?  It actually has that too.  That just scratches the surface.But most importantly, after you go through and finish each of the characters endings something magical happens: You get to fulfill a promise from long ago.  Not only do you have a shift in the game once more but you actually get the real meat of the experience and all the details that make up the world the game is set in.  And it is glorious.

Depending on your choices, you ultimately get to an ending; getting certain endings unlocks other options for other stories. Simple. The real attraction, therefore, is in the story. The premise is frankly insane; you are the only human attending a school for intelligent birds. And yet...And yet the premise is developed in a consistent and plausible way. All the characters are fully realized, and it's easy to get emotionally invested. If you go through every storyline, little bits that seemed filler will suddenly take on a larger context, and you'll realize that a *lot* of work went into the story. But even in the most emotional storylines, there are bits that will come out of nowhere and make you go ""WTF!"". That's the thing that really impresses me, that the game is consistently surprising.

However, in the eleven hours that I have played, issues I experienced were: script lines overflowing, saves not loading properly, overlapping texts, multiple option textboxes overriding the default layout, subtle music track changeover issue and the dreaded blank screens. However most of these issues were resolved by reloading the game and/or rebooting the game- At the time of this review, the trading cards go for approximately 20 cents per pieceTLDR: Overall, I started this game with very unrealistic negative bias towards the game as I thought it would be a dating sim and just like every other dating sim that I HAVE READ ABOUT, its about a protagonist who ends up with ALL the NPCs. However six hours in, I was proven right...AND wrong as there is much more to THIS avian/human dating sim that meets the eye.I would say if you love to immerse yourself in story and like reading a lot then this is a game for you.

I've put far more hours into this game than most.It sounds like a bizarre combination at first- a dating game with pigeons. No doubt, Hatoful Boyfriend creates a world where a healthy dose of belief-suspension is in order. But beneath that silly exterior is a tale that's sweet, funny, dramatic, endearing, and very cute.If you're a bird lover like I am, you'll find the world and its characters particularly charming, but you don't have to be one to connect with the cast. It's easy to forget the species of your schoolmates when you want to see how each of their stories unfold. Only the most shallow will let the fact they're pigeons get in the way of their emotional tales, which are spun to make the player laugh, love, and maybe even shed a tear here and there (anyone who watched me stream this game knows I sure did). It leans on the short side of duration, including all potential paths, but just like how it takes itself just seriously enough, the game gives you just enough to accomplish its goal without overstaying its welcome. It's succinct, hitting all the key points necessary to develop a world, tell a story, and make you interested in the characters, which is really all one can ask of it.Hatoful Boyfriend is a quirky little game that was made with love and is worth checking out, even if just to explore a dating sim from a different angle.

Each story was delightfully absurd and successful endings were easy to obtain.However, while this game initially seems like a silly, light-hearted parody, it does contain quite a few dark moments that, I imagine, are uncharacteristic of typical dating sims.(Note: Bonus storyline (BBL) is quite long and does not match the tone of the main game. It is quite serious, to the point of being surreal when paired with images of bird characters.)"

You could potentially unlock all the paths and complete the entire game in a few hours.However, in that short time, the game packs an intricately dark plot, as each successive romance you complete reveals a surprising depth to each and every bird you meet. The true ending is the longest, and the darkest part of the game, and is well worth the time.Overall, an excellent storyline coupled with the absurdity of bird romance, but you'll burn through it in only a few hours. 9/10"
,Recommended,310080,15071312,"Posted: 26 March, 2015",all,Pijon,"Hatoful Boyfriend starts out as a straight-out parody of many visual novel tropes, letting the reader get to know and enjoy the personalities of each bird. The reader gets various clues throughout the main game that there's a lot more happening behind the scenes. By the end, the story turns into a psychological horror, turning each character on his head- making the reader question everything they have learned about the birds so far. Yes, this game is quite awesome- both in the original and the HD remake.Is it worth $10? I would say ""Yes, of course it is! BBL is worth $10 alone."" However, I have noticed a few things about this new polished version that make me miss the older, typo-ridden $5 version. These are certainly nitpicks. For one, I don't like the new desktop icon (pink heart with 2 feathers sticking out) It is the most Otome looking thing on my boyish desktop and it sticks out like a sore thumb. I much prefer the green nicobar logo. Secondly, while I am thankful this game has a fullscreen mode (which makes recording footage a breeze) I believe the original has a tiny window for a reason- mainly, the bird portraits are of varying quality. In fullscreen, I get to see all the choppy pixels I wasn't aware of before. Back to the tiny window I suppose. Azami's route, newly added in this version, was lackluster. This has been built up by fans for a while now and of course, its ""safe"" nature has nothing to do with the team that polished this game up. However, when I played it, I was a bit confused as to why Azami had a one-sided mad rant to herself when cleary, Hiyoko was supposed to say at least half of the lines. Maybe that issue has been sorted by now? My biggest issue is the Save feature in BBL! I am serious about this, it ruins the mood. While there is no real way to fail BBL, it was quite a shock to readers when they first play it. It was made even scarier when the box shows up saying that save states are disabled for this portion of the game. The survival instict kicks in for a lot of readers at that point.  Players would then be cautious about their surroundings and return to HQ repeatedly to make their alotted save. In this newer, sparklier version... the player can save whenever they well please- taking away that intense atmosphere. The ""battle"" at the end? No problem, they can just save and not have to worry about potential failure. Eh, I don't like that. But the backgrounds are absolutely gorgeous in this version, and I'm very glad that Nageki has lost his awkward clutching side-foot. Also, having the option to switch from English to Japanese with the click of a button is really nice. I am glad I bought this verion of the game.A few unrelated things I noticed while playing this game again... Some of our stud birdies appear to be female! Leone JB and Rabu both have pink ceres. Also... pigeon genders are hard to identify by appearance alone, but I will say that our OkoSan has a Very feminine skull. And Ryouta's portrait... well, look at those pupils! That is one miffed bird. Anghel and Shuu are puffed out like they're absolutely freezing, the poor birds. And... that fight music? While I know it is public domain- it is also the title menu music to a gory horror BL visual novel called Cage -open-. Imagine my shock as I see Anghel on one side of the screen, Shuu on the other side of the screen, and my auditory cue for shiver-inducing psychological torture♥♥♥♥♥♥triggers. ""My god Shuu, don't!  Oh wait, you have a harmless cloaka... Do what you must, then."""

That being said, its a wonderful concept that I've be curious about forever and I'm glad I picked it up on sale.

,Recommended,310080,12822500,"Posted: 6 November, 2014",all,ApocaLiz,"So far this game has been one the strangest gaming experiences of my life, but also one of the most intriguing. I have only uncovered 4 of 12 possible endings, so I am nowwhere near done (as I definitely plan to uncover them all), but already it has transpired that the story is a lot more complex and nuanced than I was led to believe in my first playthrough.I have never played any dating sims, so I can't compare it to any other games in the genre, but I imagine it is already vastly different from the bulk of the genre by virtue of being about human-bird relationships. Which isn't nearly as creepy as it sounds, believe it or not. The characterizations of the different birds (and thus romance options) are surprisingly complex and   feature well put-together twists. I can't wait to find out what the next one has in store.I am also beginning to believe that one has to play all of the different paths in the game to fully understand the story. Each playthrough takes only about 30-40 minutes, so this is completely doable. Some endings appear to only be available after a couple of PTs, which further increases replayability.The music is also worth mentioning. Each character has their own theme that usually plays while the main character is having any interaction with them, and it consists of a wide variety of tunes, some known, some, I presume, specifically written for the game. Given the game's complete lack of voice acting, the music is a great way to give the characters some ""audible personality"".To sum it up, even if you are not a fan of visual novels or dating sims, this game is worth it for the incredibly strange setting and the great charactererization alone."

Maybe that is what makes it all the more amazing.The story is extremely entertaining, dark, and ties things up really well. If you only play through one or two of the romances you won't get to see the really nitty gritty this game has to offer. For example: Though Okosan may make you  laugh, it really isn't as great as romancing Shuu.It took me 6 hours to get to the very end (which is unlocked after getting all 14 other endings, so it's quite long. If you do plan to beat the whole thing I would suggest doing Sukuya and Okosan first as they are, arguably, the least interesting. There is one other that isn't interesting but I'm worried it's a spoiler so I won't say it.I feel those that rate this poorly didn't take it seriously, which is a real shame. If you've every played 999 or the follow up Zero Escape for the story, not the puzzles, you will like this! Those games are rated very well because people actually took them seriously.It may have pigeons you date, but that really isn't what this game is at its core.

You play as the only human in a school of birds and the object of the game is to form meaningful relationships with them. Yep, that's right, you're gonna pull yourself some sweet pigeon booty. Coo Coo. It seriously feels like a parody on the dating sim genre at best.The writing is mediocre at best with most of the birds being just as much as an oddball as the main character. The birds personalities do fall flat at time, but what really ties the game together is the 'true ending' which can only be obtained by playing through every bird's route. The true ending manages to effortlessly weave the links between all of the birds and Hiyko together leading to a story that has twists, surprises and tearjerking moments. The conclusion is satisying and enough to convince me that although this is a game with a ridiculous concept, it's meant to be taken seriously and not as the joke as it seems.Overall, Hatoful Boyfriend is a quirky game with a colourful cast of birds to romance and with enough twists and turns to remain fresh for every playful.

Even though his endings were a gruesome result, the way it's portrayed made it enjoyable to go through! Similar to a haunted house that gives you a tingly delight of scares. I read both romance and horror vn's so having them both in one game was the best thing ever for me. If you like sci-fi, romance, horror, & dark plots, then you'll love this game!That being said, I honestly would've preferred a happier ending then the one we got, but at the same time, I wouldn't want it to end any other way. Romance wise I'd say there are really only two I would call ""romance routes"". The others were kind of like ""oh yeah I like you but you'll have to wait"" sort of stories. If I counted correctly, there are four total horror endings, including The True Ending.

But, the difference between a purely joke game and this game, is that hatoful boyfriend has actual substance and worth behind it.I had known about this game for a while, and picked it up believing it would just be funny and silly and filled with bird puns, until I found myself legitimately crying at one of the endings. Then I laughed out loud because I was crying over a game about giant, sentient pigeons. Hatoful never forgets how really ridiculous it is at heart, but it is not afraid to still give you a memorable story and lovable, dynamic characters, even if they are just photos of a bird. Soon enough you start rooting for and yearing for the happiness of your favorite pidge and you wonder what the hell happened"

Some strange things may pique your interest, but it all seems part of the fun. Then you get to the second half of the story (only unlocked once you have played through dating all the birds, except San) and everything, EVERYTHING gets turned on its head.I have no words to describe the mind-bending experience that is the second half. Not so much a game as an extremely gripping visual novel that's a wild ride from start to finish. Everything is explained, all loose ends tied, a game that must be played twice - nay, three times to fully comprehend the utter brilliance of its story.

I had heard there was quite a bit of hidden depth to this game... But I was not expecting as much of it as there was. Of the various routes in the game, some were more emotional than others, and some were downright silly. By chance, I started off with what seemed to be among the most emotional of them all, so several of the other routes were a little disappointing by comparison. There were references to Pokemon and Gurren Lagann and other popular culture littered throughout the visual novel, which was entertaining for a time, but they're not so overused as to come off as trying too hard to be funny. Honestly, for the most part, you should just treat 90% of those routes as a basic introduction to the characters.Then I started the final route. It starts out almost the same... And then takes a huge left turn. It is basically a totally different game, and pretty much my primary reason for recommending the game. It answers all the questions brought up and never answered in the other routes (and some you might not even have thought of). It's *very* emotional at times, and just generally intense. So if you play a few routes and aren't too impressed, hang in there. It is worth it.It's almost certainly worth $10, and you should definitely get it if it's on sale. The soundtrack is comprised of a bunch of short, looping songs, but the writing/translation is surprisingly good (barring a few occasional mistakes like missing words), and the story turned out to be really compelling. You'll laugh, you might cry, you'll definitely say ""holy♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; a few times.Buy it. You will not regret it."

The gameplay is easy: Choose the right options in the dialogs to get to get the path you are aiming for. I am impressed that this game has an actual plot and many paths and endings to choose from. This game is really to be taken serious, and not as some game made out of boredom.I can spend hours playing this game and just playing the same routes over and over again without getting bored of it. It is a good game to spend time on, and it is for sure lovely made and genre-twisting.What appears to be a normal bird-dating simulation turns out to be to something romantic and entertaining, and it has even it's emotional points which are not overly dramatic in any way.Out of the many characters to choose, each of them have their own backstory and it sure is fun to explore each. This game really took me by surprise, since at first I thought of it as a joke, and now it is one of my favorite ones.

There is no gameplay apart from clicking and reading and making choices. No quicktime-events like in The Walking Dead or The Wolf Among Us. If that does not suit you, do not buy this game. If, however, you are a fan of stories and twisted narrative, you should definitely get it. The protagonist is a human, attending a bird-school and the main goal is to flirt and date the various characters that can be met. This sounds crazy and boring, but it is not. This game is just f*cked up. The graphics are not worth mentioning, the soundtrack however suits the game pretty nicely. The writing can get you hooked, if you are ready to ignore the typos that occur from time to time. The first playthrough should take about 2 hours, but there is replay-value, as there are several different endings. It is not for everybody, but if you want something new and crazy, this is probably a game for you."

I mean sure there are games that appeal to the sensitive side of us through illness or death, but what makes this in my mind so much more human in its emotion? It's simple: it's the lack of humans, in a world where you play as the last of the human race it is so much more touching to see compassion and true emotion. Would I play it again?

It has a silly premise, but it's a really enjoyable game.What really makes this game so great (besides finally making your dream of having a bird boyfriend come true) is the true ending. I wouldn't want to spoil too much because the less you know the better it will be, just prepare for the game to take a turn.The game goes cheap in the sales so you can force all of your friends to love birds as much as you do. I mean, who wouldn't want to spend hours arguing over who is the best bird husbando?tl;dr Moa is a genius. Get out there and date pigeons. Make all your friends date pigeons.

Boy was I surprised when it turned into a semi-serious love parody with so many different and eclectic storylines. If your looking for a serious dating sim then this isn't the game for you but if you are the type to try something different then yes this definitely somethng to try out. Even get your friends over and play a bit of the game because it will cause mental breakdown and hilarity! Especially if your having a drinking night ;)So to sum up: Enjoyable game, with good graphics and characters, plenty of storylines that range from unpredictable to hilarious. So if you do like a good laugh that comes as a visual game and the chance to date birds then this is definitely the game to go for."

However, the more you play, the more serious things get. Some of the routes leave you feeling a little ""wtf""? Even though going through 14 endings seems daunting, and skipping through the common story parts so many times is repetetive, the new parts were always fresh and interesting.By the time you get to the true ending, it's all worth it.

This bloody game.Never before had I thought a game where the main objective is to date a bird would be so engrossing.The characters are a likeable blend of personalities, from flamboyant to caring, to silly and dramatic, and everything in between. The story, which at first seemed simple, became very interesting, and even pretty dark in some places, with a great mix of absurdity and humour mixed in, as if Boris Johnson on every drug imaginable decided to contribute to the game after playing too much Final Fantasy and ate too much pudding. The music was nice and charming, and the multiple endings definately added quite a bit of replay value. The game WAS rather short, but, in all honesty, I feel like it was the right amount of short. It didn't drag on, and something usually interesting was going on in St. Pigeonations.And the final storyline, oh god, the final storyline... It was something else, let me tell ya.There's a pretty big spoiler for the final- and main, might I add- storyline of the game here, so skip if you don't want your virgin eyeballs assaulted by spoilers and such.The ""Hurtful Boyfriend"" chapter was very enjoyable, with many story twists that present themselves within this portion of the game, such as the real identity of Sakuya, the secret of what the main protagionist's role was, the tragic backstory of Nageki and Kazuyaki, the true role of Shuu, and so much more. And the whole Danganronpa vibe it gave off was so nostalgic to me, as I have played both Trigger Happy Havoc and Goodbye Despair before. I smiled the whole way through, just enjoying the feel and the story of that final story.In short, if you have the cash, buy this game. that's all I can say, really. This game is one of those examples where you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover."

76561198049207950,Recommended,310080,16659386,"Posted: 23 June, 2015",all,Undying,"This game.  What more is there to say about this game beyond what has been said already?  It purports to be a bird dating sim, but under the zany surface, it is so much more.  There are multiple routes through the story, each matching you with a different avian.  Every route is some combination of hilarious, sad, and disturbing.  The writing is entertaining, and the game is very self-aware.  You'll think you're laughing at the game, and then you'll realize you've been laughing with it the entire game.But after you get your laughs (and maybe a few tears) from the dating routes, a new option will open up.  The ""Bad Boys Love"" route is the true heart of this game.  It is a well-written, fascinating, suspenseful tale that ditches the veneer of ""wacky bird dating sim"" completely.  All of the little details from each of the dating routes come together in unexpected ways.  I hesitate to say more, for fear of spoiling it, but rest assured, it's worth it.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll encounter unexpected nightmare fuel, and you'll definitely never look at pigeons the same way again.So, really, to enjoy this game, you need to be a certain kind of person.  If you appreciate good writing, hold humor and serious (even disturbing) content in equally high esteem, and can get over the fact that all the characters are birds, give this game a go.  You might just fall in love."

I was wrong, and in away I am glad I was.  It's a simple game, many choices, I hear many outcomes.  I have decided to write this though now after only beating it once even if I plan to go back and play it many times again.I see people question why others like this.  My reason is, the characters even though they are basic you can feel and see a deeper meaning behind them.  Not being able to see them besides pictures of birds make you focus on their personalities even more.  It touches you more in that way, you're not just going for the one you like the looks of best.  In my eyes this is good for a game like this to have.  Allows you to open your eyes and realize what you may end up with just by feelings alone."

Your world is centered on cherishing the only thing you have left: education.Perhaps one day they will eventually find a way to merge human and bird DNA but until then, you are second to a superior, majestic species.What do you eat and drink? How truly cold is the stone bed you sleep upon at night, when you dream restlessly of the Utopia our Earth had once been - a damaged, often brutal Utopia, but a world in which humans bowed to no one but themselves. You toss and turn and wake with a sore neck, wondering why you can't simply end it all.However, you cannot possibly do that to your only pigeon friend. Truly, as an outcast amongst many, you gravitate towards one another. Rules be damned! You need to talk to someone when you feel alone.The game unfolds, adhering to a strict timetable of work or conversation with your plumed peers. At home, as you scavenge fruitlessly in a barren cave, you start to miss the time spent with others, if only to avoid the gut-wrenching hunger that is merely temporarily assuaged with nuts, berries and seeds.The ending surprises you but you've given up now. It might as well be, laws of Nature aside. You have no idea how you'll survive, and you're sure that you are unlikely to procreate. At this point, life has worn you down to a shadow of the person you once were. Sometimes you entertain the idea of gluing feathers yourself in order to fit in....Oh God.

You quickly become wrapped up in stories that actually evoke feelings, stories as well written as any dating sim I have played. This ends up being better than some of the things it is supposed to be a parody of.I recommend this highly if you enjoy dating sims, but want a bit of humor too.

She is actually quite transparent but not in a dull way that you expect from most otome games.Most routes can be completed within an hour, but rather than actually seducing the pigeons it's more like you get to know them better. All in preparation for the BBL route which you get once you've unlocked every boy's ending.Hatoful Boyfriend seems just like a random silly game you'd play so you can comment 'Pigeons lulz!!"" and make crappy bird puns on the internet, but the story turns out to be dark enough to keep you coming back for more. The way every character is woven into the big scheme of things here was really well done. Also there are no ero-scenes, which doesn't impact the game in the slightest. Nevertheless the endings (There are 16 in total) are very rewarding.I thought it would just be a silly game, but I found myself really enjoying the narrative and trying to piece things together. Also I got a few laughs out of this and have a crush on a few characters. The soundtrack isn't bad either and the dialogue is quite funny.Overall, a lot better than anyone would expect."

But when my character mentionedbeing a hunter-gathererwithin the first few minutes, I knew that there had to be more to it than that.As I continued through the game, I found that it was not only much more amusing than I'd expected, but that the characters were genuinely engaging--particularly Okosan (tiny brain, big heart), Sakuya (imagine if Draco Malfoy were a) likeable and b) a fantail pigeon), and Yuuya (a mysterious ladies' man). The first time I played, I got the bad ending because I liked all of the birds so much that I couldn't decide which one to focus on!After that, I felt like I had to stick around and get all of the characters' endings. It helped that after the first run-through, there was a fast forward button that allowed me to skip sequences I'd seen before. Following most endings, I'd find a new entry in the ""Archive"" section of the game that hinted at a convoluted backstory. And once I'd finished with all that, I found a new option available in the beginning of the game that unlocked therealstory, which was unexpectedly dark and twisted.This is honestly one of the most entertaining games I've ever played and I would recommend it to just about anyone.

Overall, worth buying on sale, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't already a fan of visual novels."

I will never look at birds the same way ever again.But seriously.Word of advice: stick with the game, finish all the main birds' routes and the epilogue and you will be glad you did!This isn't your typical otome game (assuming you saw the birds in the screenshots) and maybe you were wondering maybe they would turn into humans? DO NOT BE DECIEVED BY THE FIRST OPTION WITH THE ADVANCED GRAPHICS TECHNOLOGY. I thought it was funny how the game offers it but it doesn't affect the visuals at all. It focuses more on the plot rather than gameplay. At first you might think when you finish a route, ""Wow, is that it? I was expecting more."" or ""What were they on when they were making this?!"".

You pursue them for the sake of game completion, knowing full well that your character's getting into something unappealing and possibly even dangerous.

I loved it so much that when it came out on Steam, I made sure to buy it (because achievements).  Rinse, repeat for Android.  This was the start of my downward spiral into otome games, a fandom I am so deeply entangled with now, there is simply no return for me.Hatoful Boyfriend wasn't supposed to be serious.  It wasn't supposed to make me FEEL.  But it did.  At first, you're so taken with the ""Haha I'm dating birds"" aspect, but then the game tricks you into seeing the characters, each nuanced in their own multilayered backstories, for more than what they are.  You start wanting to know more about them, wanting them to be happy, hurting when they hurt.  It's ridiculous.And don't even get me started on the BBL stuff.  My face had melted by that point.I would encourage basically everyone to play this game, especially since it goes on sale often enough, and the whole experience is worth the small amount of money for it.

But this game is far more than bird dating!At first i said ""Hihihi, stupid visual novel with pigeons, hihihi"". There are 9 birds who are dateable, each has one unique story and each story concludes in an ending. 3 endings can be extended to 'true endings' by visiting certain classes and gaining points (you are a student). These endings are somewhat surprising and often either expectedly funny or exceptionally emotional.After you romanced each bird once, you gain the ability to play the 'Bad Boys Love'-Story. This story is heartwrecking! It concludes every other storyline by answering any leftover questions. It plays maybe 5 times as long as a normal storyline and it can be quite difficult to follow at times, but in the end (and inbetween), at least i found myself near tears ;_;At the very latest then (like midway through the BBL-story) you realize, this game has not only bird-dating. It hasreligious themes, political themes, a James Bond equivalent, nazis, acurate scientific explanations, though describing inexplicable actions (birds dont have hands), zombie-robots, RPG-fights, and MORE!And bird-dating.10/10 would date again"

Boy was I wrong.This game may seem humorous at first, but it is far more than that. The complete story is deep and sad, and I found myself crying my heart out over the bbl portion, and I'm fairly certain a lot of other people did so as well. I'm going to try to avoid revealing too many spoilers, because the game is best played blind.There are a couple of spelling errors in translation--a letter missing here, some letters switched around when they shouldn't be, there. I didn't find them too bothersome, but some might.There is also a single swear word in the game, but it's during Shuu's route, and that isn't the most enjoyable route, anyway. I don't want to reveal too much, so I'll leave that there.But overall, I recommend this game. It's a unique game with a beautiful story, and I would recommend it to anybody who likes games, stories, birds, anything.The overall game isn't even that much focused on the actual dating anyways, if you don't like dating sims that much, and in what I consider the true ending, the main character doesn't even hook up with anybody.I also went ahead and bought the sequel game, or whatever it is, but I think I'll take a little break before I go into that.

As I watched however my opinion changed to the point I decided to buy and play the game for myself.It's really more interactive novel than game, and the premise IS odd and just slightly silly, but the game is deliberately tongue in cheek and playfully makes fun of it's own insanity. That said don't play this expecting complete lightheartedness , humour and pure parody (although that side is definitely part of it), if you follow certain routes and get into the back-story of the world and characters it can get surprisingly dark, and the story is better and surprisingly has more depth than you'd think at first glance, it even manages to be sad in places.

I'm a big fan of VN's and SimDates so I figured I had to play this jokey seeming game to at least try it out.A lot of the reviewers will say it better than me, but this game is just heartwrenching and beautiful. I definitely recommend it, but more than anything I recommend it all the way through. Theres a special ending you get if you do everyones path and it is phenominal and ties a lot of loose ends up."

There's nothing special about the graphics that would really need a screen larger that the 3ds. This game is definitely all about the stories.I'm saying yes because of the additional storyline that unlocks after all the dating sim stuff, totally unexpected."

76561198004737917,Recommended,310080,33733728,Posted: 22 July,all,bluejedi81,I'm echoing probably every other review of this game. I bought it thinking it was a joke and something fun I could play for cheap from the Steam Summer Sale.  As I romanced my first bird everything seemed silly and fun - and honestly if you play it and just romance one bird and forget it... you will still enjoy it. But I encourage you to play through every romance and ending. The story was amazing. I thought I was going to laugh my way through most of this but instead I got my heart broken by a moving story and some birds.

The bad news ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................He's a pigeon.""=====================================================================================Not for the serious Otome Game Players and people who feel uneasy to date birds.But if you're curious about a life of the only human girl who attends a school for birds, congrats! Go buy this game!You will experience  a few chuckles here and there, esp. with some scenes, plus some moans and groans with the bird puns. (As told by the reviewers before me...)This game may fall under a Romantic-Comedy genre but you thought wrong, looks can be deceiving.Anyway, like most games, this game has a few bugs.(1) The part where you choose the extracurricular activites (i.e.) Student Council, Track Team, etc. When you save on that said part and decided to load on that same save slot, (if you made a mistake later in the game or fed up having clicking the new game option, after you have finished any of the bird's route). The choice for the Infirmary Staff is not available.So you have to go back to the beginning, wait, and save on the previous dialogue box, before the extra-curricular options are given to you by the teacher.(2) Sometimes the skip button doesn't work. (As like most Otome Games, the urge to click the skip button is strong, especially when you finished a route and have to start all over again)(3) Some choice buttons are needed to be click a few times, in order for you to proceed.Those are the bugs that I have encountered, so far.The storyline is kind of unique especially at the end, (I REALLY did not expected that). The heroine's personality is somewhat bland,though she has more common sense than the heroine from the previous Otome Game I played with. The characters' relationship with each other are well-written,esp. with the brothers.While, the character development is so-so,except for Nageki, Sakuya, his older brother, Yuuya and the teacher, Kuzuaki.Grammar can be easily overlooked (unless you are as severe as an English Teacher). There are no voices on this game, neither are the chirps. Some of the background music can be found quite catchy.Overall, Hatoful Boyfriend is one of the Otome Games that I found it memorable and enjoyable.====================================================================================If you want to buy the bundle,( the DLC, and it's sequel), but found yourself unsure, i.e. if the price is worth it. I suggest to wait for the sale season."

It might feel a bit sluggish around 30-60% through, but sticking with the dating sim part of the game is well worth it for the second half. The dating sim endings are all some shade of sad and then there's Okosan, but the Hurtful Boyfriend story is worth getting killed twice. And having to woo Sakuya twice. Anyway, it's a wild ride. No, you don't get to do any X rated stuff with birds, but you might solve some murders."

,Recommended,310080,34137784,Posted: 9 August,all,Mooch,"Hatoful Boyfriend means ""Heartfull boyfriend"" but could also be a play on words of the word hateful. And this game is certainly one that can tug on your heartstrings. Ok, it's a weird premise (you play a human girl attending a school for pigeons), but the characters discuss themese like love, mortality, acting against parental wishes and isolation. You have multiple save slots and take turns playing out the storyline in ways to romance each of the characters. The dialogue is very funny and the artwork is cute. There are achievements to unlock by playing out each character's storyline. It's not a game you get swept up in but it's very funny and strangely thought-provoking at times."

I decided to download it and I guess I just completed my first playthrough. I say 'I guess' because it ended in a way that I found really abrupt and unsatisfying, which I'm not sure what I did to trigger. I only played the game very briefly, but I did not dislike it. I thought the characters were interesting, the story seemed quite intriguing and although I wouldn't call Hatoful Boyfriend realistic and the level of interaction was pretty limited, it was surprisingly immersive. The dialogue was, at times, cringe-worthy and my personal experience was disappointing, but the devotion of the game's fans has me intending to attempt a second playthrough sometime in the near future."

But when he stopped playing the game it really sucked. So a year or so later I ended up buying the game for myself. And it was well worth the money I spent.
