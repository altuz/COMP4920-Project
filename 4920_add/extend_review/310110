76561197974363278,Not Recommended,310110,12797398,"Posted: 4 November, 2014",all,Avengernaut,"An overpriced mod with currently not enough content... uses all the NS2 assets, so its a mod - there's no denying it. It is not the old Combat from NS1 that we all know and loved. I bought this game on a gamble becuase I figured, ""how bad could it be?"" Turns out I bought this just so I could tell the rest of you it's not worth it right now for this price. If it goes on sale for a noticable amount, then it might be worth something.The only MOBA element is the fact that each team has their main HQ building and the objective is to destroy it. There are no creep waves, no item shops or items to buy. Sure you get your upgrades, but it just feels kinda shallow, like there just isnt enough variation or something in the upgrade paths you can pick.In terms of relating this to the old NS1 combat, it simply just doesn't have the progression and variety that it had. It doesn't have the HMG, Heavy Armor, and it doesn't have the extensive amount of upgrades that Extra Levels plugin offered in the old NS1, which is what everyone used to play with. Everyone seems to forget that nobody liked the vanilla NS1 combat that came with the game, it was the Extra Levels plugin that made it more enjoyable.And right now, nobody plays this game. Why? Probably either becuase it just isn't fun enough to keep people interested and/or is way too pricey for the kind of game it is. Thus it probably isn't worth the price."
,Not Recommended,310110,12751101,"Posted: 2 November, 2014",all,Satertek,"First off, I'm going to write about the game, not the price tag.  Personally I don't have a problem with them charging extra for it, but that doesn't affect my review.So here's where I'm coming from:  I've played Natural Selection since the release of the original mod for Half-Life, Combat for Natural Selection, and NS2, but not the Combat Mod for NS2.  I'll be comparing this to both NS1:Combat and NS2.Main Differences from NS2 and/or NS1:Combat:Good:1) No commanders.  Also in NS1:Combat, this is one of the main draws of the gametype.  You don't have to rely on anyone to get the weapons and upgrades you want.  You don't instantly lose because a first time commander is in the chair.  It sets up a more casual game that focuses on kills instead of a big strategic plan of attack.2) Buildings.  Yes, you can build stuff, unlike NS1:Combat.  A huge change.  Phase gates and Gorge tunnels help you control the map like you're playing a vanilla style NS2 game.  I like it.Bad:1) XP Gain.  Another huge change from NS1:Combat is how hard it is to gain XP.  Leveling is much slower and gone is the ""area xp"" where everyone gets XP in the vicinity of the kill.  You get XP from kills, assists, and captures.  Also making XP gain difficult is that with such a small player base, 90% of the players are already very skilled NS2 players.  If you've never played NS, you will die alot and you will never get XP.One of the things I really liked about NS1:Combat is it's more casual gameplay style.  Level gains were quick, if you fell behind, you'd get XP anyway.  Here, if you fall behind, you're done.  You can't really compete when you're low level against a bunch of people with armor, and the game doesn't help you out any.I've read the upgrade progression is very limiting as well, but I haven't been able to level up enough to run into that problem.It's hard to recommend this game to anyone.  If you already have NS2, it's pretty much the same game.  If you don't have NS2, you're going to die a lot, get stuck at the bottom of the scoreboard, and never given any upgrades to help you compete.  A new player would actually have an easier time in standard NS2, as personal performance doesn't matter as much."

As it stands, here are the biggest issues:* Not enough differentiation from NS2 base game. New weapons and abilities are present, but what would have been really great is new game modes.* Loading times are still abysmal. One of the few games worth installing on a SSD.* Only 1 active server, with tons of experienced players which results in ridiculously stacked games. Matchmaking is useless, so its pretty disheartening to have new players get chomped through. Much less voice chat which made the original NS2 more of a community / kept new players engaged.All in all, worth <$5. At $15, it's overpriced for what it is. Know that you are paying to basically play against 40-50 regulars."

The playerbase is abysmal compared to NS2 regular and being newly launched as well. Pricing is a bit too much as it is more than the NS2 regular with features removed and added a few new items. I noticed alot of veteran players stomping in combat leading to onesided games. Balancing in skill is horrendous, some lifeofrms are just not worth evovling into. I felt ripped off and cheated.

It's a vain cash grab at monetizing a previously free mod for NS2, with the forced breakage of the natural NS2 mod (and refusal to update it to fix it) coinciding with the release of this game. Segregating this portion of the community behind a paywall has only fractured the remaining players.Although it has potential, the developer's hard-fisted approach to balance quickly brought even the most dedicated players into reluctance for a quick match. The low population of players (often only one server is populated) quickly declined from double, to single digits after reckless developer patches that implimented more frustration and ruined balance.In the last two weeks, those single digit numbers can be summed up as one digit.""0"" players. RIP in pieces."

My thoughts on this release as of 11/1/2014. They've sucked the fun out of combat. Anything of actual fun in the game is gated behind ""level requirements"". Nevermind the fact you have the skillpoints to use these abilities, nope. Aliens are heavily affected by this basically rendering all their upper tier abilities a joke. Xenocide is a joke, by the time you get the ability you might as well go onos because you won't be getting those nice 6+ kills from the ns1 3.0 days. Even stuff like bile bomb, or spore are stuck behind level requirements even if you have the lifeform and points.NS2: Combat suffers from the same issue that NS2 did. It's a pretty looking, but poorly executed, boring conversion of a great half life 1 mod."

It is fairly well balanced, and includes some fun upgrades from extra levels.To those who never played NS1:This is a team FPS game. Sorta moba style were the point is to push into the enemy base and kill there CC/Hive. You must work as a team to complete this task. But, unlike NS2 (vanilla) you dont have a commander that chooses your upgrades and dictates the path your team takes, each idividual player gets to pick there own upgrades as they level up during the round.

I like to know whether I'm getting ripped off or not as it's happened more than once lately. Steam has been letting piles of crap be sold on their service the last several months.It seems most of the negative reviews stem from people who already played NS2: Combat as a mod. I have the pleasure of not ever even hearing about this game until I saw it on the steam store. A lot of the negative reviewers seem to complain about miniscule changes to gameplay compared to the mod as well as the extremely low population right now. These are my thoughts ten hours in (yes I know not nearly as many as people would like, but I intend to continue to play this.Gameplay: Having not played the mod, I enjoy the gameplay very much. It's a nice change of pace from the generic FPS flooding the market today. It's very assymetrical teamplay and I've seen it where skilled marines dominate the map, and where skilled aliens dominate the map. It just takes knowing how to play. That being said, the learning curve is *extremely* steep for newcomers.I can definitely understand the reviews about veterans making it difficult to jump into. However I can somewhat expect this from a game that was just released that most people have not heard of after being a mod. I've been frustrated several times because of how squishy I seemed. It literally seemed like no matter what side I was playing, I was being instagibbed just from a marine or alien looking at me the wrong way. I severely underestimated the power of armor in this game. Tip for newcomers: if you want to survive more than .5 seconds in sight of a group of marines, stack up that armor buff.Low population: This game is a relatively unknown game in the world of games. It has no advertising to speak of, was a mod of yet another little known game, and just released less than a week ago. The low population is still a valid statement for reviewers to be making right now. Playing Sunday there were really only 3, maybe 4 populated servers. Couldn't have been more than 70-80 folks at any given time?  Maybe it wasn't the games peak time. Hopefully more people purchase this game.It took getting used to the game mechanics, and I'm still relatively noobish but at least I'm getting instagibbed less now. The gameplay is *extremely* fast paced in terms of movement around the environment, whether an alien or marine with a jetpack be-boppin all over the place. It takes getting used to. The game definitely favors those who work/stick together, most lone wolves will die. Often times the games go longer as each side fights the other trying to level up to get a powerful enough force to decimate the enemies base.There are only 5 maps in the game, used twice for either control point (not well suited for this game) or what they call deathmatch but you're actually trying to destroy the enemies base. Most of the maps are though out well enough to accomodate both sides. I think there was one where one of the teams could easily trap you in your base and farm, which wasn't fun.Hopefully they do expand the core content with some sort of update (maybe fix jumping so you don't become an invincible marine). More maps would be nice. The current lineup of playable lifeforms and marine upgrades is great. More would always be nice.TL:DR (""Too Long: Didn't Read"" for the new folk): Negative reviews are based on prior biases of players who played the mod forever. The learning curve is very steep and the gameplay is fun and a great change of pace from traditional FPSs. Techncial performance is overall solid with only a couple of minor clipping issues and occasional lag hiccup, neither of which occur often. Bought this game on sale, and can safely say there are much worse games I've spent more money on than this, so I'm happy with my purchase."

I like this game/mod just as much as i like NS2, but i'm starting to think that i made a mistake in buying it. Not because i think it wasn't worth it! Far from it! But because the community is so small. It needs more players or it'll die before it even gets off the ground.As far as i'm concerned, it's fun. It's no more a waste of money than buying CS:GO when you have CS:Source, as i know MANY people did and still do. But at the moment there is at least one server with players on it. That's right! One! So what i propose is that people buy it if you're curious and can splurge a little. If enough people do that then the community will grow and the game/mod will pay for itself easy. But if people don't buy it and play it, the small community it has will eventually die out.So, all-in-all, yes, i recommend the game. It's fun, i enjoy it. I'd like to keep enjoying it. But it just needs more people. I'll update this review if the game every COMPLETELY dies out so you get a heads up. But, beyond that, this game gets a recommendation for people that don't mind the high learning curve or for people that liked Natural Selection 2 but would rather have a simpler experience (as in no commander).Also, if the high learning curve is off-putting, you can probably ask someone to help you out. After all, it's in their best interests to keep a newbie from feeding exp to the enemy team.EDIT 1 DAY AFTER WRITING REVIEWI already can't recommend this game anymore. Just got on playing a 3v3 match and now i realize the REALLY big problem with these low population matches. THEY. ARE. SO. BORING! Ugh, i want my money back! Basically the whole game was just the marines hiding in their base with turrets up with my teammates and i running in, getting hurt, and getting healed to give the gorge exp. The only way we could push in was via Onos. That's it! With marines camping their♥♥♥♥♥♥♥spawn with turrets it took FOREVER for me to go from skulk to onos! That's a fundamental problem with the game that they really should do something about.If only they advertized the game better and sold it at a wiser price, maybe it could have stood a chance. I see about 60 positive reviews about this game. so people need to GET ON AND PLAY IT.

It is still asymetrical but throws the RTS-part out the window. It also incorporates some light RPG elements where you get XP for killing or hurting enemies which you can invest in new equipment and skills. It's a lot of fun when you have even teams and the learning curve isn't as high as in the original Natural Selection games. The devs are dedicated and trying to do what they can but sadly the servers are mostly empty. The game had a pretty hard start and got a lot of hate because many people expected to get this for free which is kinda stupid since the devs put a lot of work into this and deserve to get paid for their work if you enjoy it.

I hope it will have more active players in the future and maybe therefore the necessery bug fixes/ balancing. Playing as Alien or Marien can cause a lot of thrill and adrenaline.

,Not Recommended,310110,12933666,"Posted: 13 November, 2014",all,Fen,"This game is literally a stand alone version of Faultline Games' mod to Natural Selection 2.  If you like Natural Selection 2 and enjoy playing it then you will enjoy this game.If you have not played Natural Selection 2 then do not buy this game until the developers add a demo of some sort.  This is a multiplayer game akin to Team Fortress or tribes, there is no single player content aside from playing against extremely rudimentary bots.This game is built on the premise of being a competitive asymmetrical pvp game that is fought between two factions: Marines and aliens called the Khara.  Marines are similar to playing an older FPS with contemporary mechanics.  The Khara are similar to playing a handful of different games.There is a player leveling system based on experience points gained in game.  There is a character progression system in play sessions that levels up the player character to unlock things in the game.  On the Marine side this in-session leveling system is used to unlock guns and exosuits.  On the Khara side this system is used to unlock abilities and new classes.A general description of the game paints it as intruiging, which is true: the concept is interesting.  The execution is where most of the game's shortcoming come from.  There isn't enough to differentiate this game from Natural Selection 2, but instead it feels like the in-session progression system is a half-baked mechanic.This game's success is dependent on it being different enough from Natural Selection 2 to draw players away from it, and yet it is not.  It is so similar to Natural Selection 2's mod called Combat that many players who like the series are staying there or boycotting this game.On average there are 30 players playing this game, and those are mostly the holdouts who want the game to succeed.  On Octorber 30th the game had a large spike in players going up to 116, then increasing to 128 players by Nov 1st.  However, these numbers droped to 56 by Nov 4th, and have more or less been on a slow and steady decline.  It appears that new players join the game and then quit shortly after.This should tell you the kind of game you are getting here.  If new players are joining and then quitting within a week then there are massive problems with the game itself.This game's biggest problem is that it does nothing to retain new players.  The players who are already playing and have hundreds of hours in the game and love it will continue playing—they are the holdouts—but new players will play for a week or so and then quit to play something more accessable.  New players are pitted against experienced players and there are no mechanics to help new players win.  There are no first optimal strategies that have low skill and reward ceilings such as CoD's noob-tube, Street Fighter's thousand hand slap, or Unreal Tournament 99's rocket launcher.New players are thrown into a meat grinder, and they quickly decide they do not want to play this game.  People who are enjoying it will tell them that it takes 50 - 200 hours to properly enjoy the game, but the problem is that there is nothing to ease new players into enjoying the game.  No lower skill strategies that evolve into higher skill strategies whereby noobs become pros.The other primary problem with this game is the community.  The developers will ban people from the forums for ""trolling"" and then cite their rules instead of actually trying to find out what is wrong and why the player feels negatively about the game.  The community itself can be extremely toxic, and that just leads into negativity going all around.If you live in the E.U. you can more or less try this game without risk since you can return it after playing it if you do not enjoy it.  If you live outside the E.U. where that law does not apply then buy at your own risk.If you speak negatively about this game the developers will, instead of working towards making their product better, pursue you onto whatever social media they can find that you use and harass you there.  True professionals, though it is good for a laugh from time to time.This will tell you how many people are playing the game before you buy it.http://steamcharts.com/app/310110I regret this purchase.  A great many other people also regret buying this.  Many of the posititve reviews are either from developers or people who absolutely loved the mod before it became a standalone.  The negative reviews come from people who are not pros at Natural Selection 2."

(Because it is their  own separate game, so they do deserve to be paid for it. Beware of misinformation about UWE simply being greedy and chopping up NS2.) There are some advantages to it being a standalone, too, chief among them being more creative freedom for mechanics and content, as well as increased performance due to being able to cut out a lot of the unused systems from the engine.I am very much looking forward to additional content, balancing, and other features, both from the Faultline team and the modding community at large. The sky is the limit when you have Steam Workshop support, full toolkits available, and a LUA-script based game.P.S. I don't view complaints about competitor skill as valid grounds for judging a game, but for those who are curious, I've seen an even distribution of marine and alien victories thus far. People love to QQ, but the fact is Natural Selection has always been a heavily skill-based game. Especially combat mode, where most strategic over-layers are stripped away. Instead of trying to bash the game with your shallow negative review and scare people away from trying it, why don't you check your ego and give an objective opinion? Because more players will result in what you want: a more even distribution of skill throughout servers/matches."

However, I also expected there to be a combat mode on NS2 when it first came out, I was disappointed with that.  Paying for this one does feel negative, but the game has played well for me and I have enjoyed it.I am still getting my feet... claws? under me again but even with getting completely destroyed a few times, I am enjoying it.  I get acknowledged for assisting which for someone who plays gorge/lerk, this is really good.  That said, it does feel a little off late game, but I am content to wait and see how things go because I am having fun.Personally, I would recommend this over NS2 normal to friends who like online shooters.  In that sense, the game is just right, I do wish they would have given those who owned NS2 a discount like most other people, but you know what, it is fun enough for the price I have paid.  I definitely doesnt feel anywhere near as much of a rip off as Borderland Pre Sequel."
,Recommended,310110,12808905,"Posted: 5 November, 2014",all,Quintox,"What is going on..Let me start with this: NS2:Combat is anexcellentgame. And I don't really understand why people are complaining about the price, 15,- bucks is hardly worth mentioning. Give the developers some slack, they've put time and effort into creating this game and it has turned out much better then the mod could ever be. I remember paying money on CS:GO, arguably it's the exact same thing.Don't try to compare it with NS2 just because it uses the same assets, see the game as a combination of NS2/Quake/Ut/Dota. It's extremely fast paced, very hard to master but it's incredibly rewarding once you top the charts.I don't agree with people saying it's unbalanced, I've seen aliens and marines win in both rush games and long, tense turtle fights. Just today we lost the game as marines simply because we made 1 little mistake in our defense and the alien team was smart enough to exploit that weakness, we lost that game against all odds ( we were far superior the entire match ). Saying it is unbalanced just because you have a hard time catching up with the speed of the aliens, or because you're not used to the gameplay aliens have to offer isn't fair to the game.Quake3, Painkiller, UT99 were all hard games and you did get dominated and humiliated ALOT. It was simple ""Get better, or simply die"" and that was OK. Why is it a bad thing to have a steep learning curve and to actually see yourself grow ( and lose at first)? Isn't it that much more rewarding once you actually get better?About the community:People on the forums are saying the community is bad and elitism roams freely ( imo that is as usual the very vocal minority ). To those guys I say: Please, enlighten me, show me these unpleasant encounters. I've been playing on ""The thirsty Onos"" for a couple of days now, and I haven't seen a single negative comment or elitist punk hammer on others. What I do hear is laughter, people having fun,  voice communications, instructions, jokes and frankly people are having a blast on that server. Where do I find this terrible community you mention? I honestly can't share your experience. Check out the numerous Twitch streams ( MaxxPlays for example ) and decide for yourself what the community is like.The game:As I said before, I love it, it's excellent! Well balanced, extremely fast paced and highly rewarding. You would expect a huge cluster♥♥♥♥ and bottleneck, which at times does occur yes, but the perks and upgrades have been well thought out to counter this and to move the game forward. If you're not that good of a shooter, please go ahead and pick one of the support/heal/build upgrades to support your team and still get XP for doing so. If you do know how to hit your target, you will definitely have a blast at this game. I mentioned before that it reminds me a lot of twitch arena shooters like Quake/UT with elements from MOBA/RPG games. If you're a fan of arena shooters with a certain RPG element, you're seeking a challenging FPS and don't want to get nurtured ( like CoD does ), then you'll most likely enjoy NS2:Combat.Con:It still has a very tiny and fragile playerbase, it might not even survive and die fairly soon. Which would be a huge bummer because it's a great game. There are plenty of servers in the list, but only like 2, maybe 3 are populated. Those servers do have quite a few very skilled players, which for me isn't a bad thing ( I love it ), but I can imagine new players might get overwhelmed. Then again, there's no better motivation then wanting to beat skilled players right?General thought:People saying elitism and flames are what destroying MP games. I disagree.. e.g. Counter-Strike lasted for 10 years and is still one of the best MP games ever produced. It had one of the worst and disrespectful communities out there, but still lasted a VERY long time. I think the complaining vocal minority that floods every forum ( not just NS2's or Combat's ) is the reason for games to expire prematurely these days. The non-stop complaining about everything. If only people wouldn't get upset or offended so easily, the world would've been a better place.."

NS2 Combat should have optimized your settings to allow the games loading times to be a bit quicker. Not saying there a VAST improvement but they're much better then NS2.
