Im not a big fan of theses types of games,but when i saw this game in the store page i though, ""I'll give it a try"".  I was wrong. This game has so much detail in it. It made me sad,but it taught me things, so i highly recomend this game :3. 10/10 5 starts or whatever the maxium is.(Ps) Make the game free and complete and then see how you can make money. :) :3"

Like the game describes, three points of view. The view of the child is true and glorious, in which:In the ""#?!"" in the child's POV, it has an emotional feel to it, because it's true that no kid likes it when their parents argue, so the kid goes to his book and his own little world, which I loved.I have nothing to say about the middle-aged man, but the old man is amazing.The old man is amazing because he's slow physically and mentally, but regardless, he still has feelings for others and his deceased wife, which is played in the happy dreams door. His sickness plays a role in every door, and takes a big hit in the nightmare door. Plus, the dream door just really made me happy personally,because he dreamt of his wife and he always comments how beautiful she was, and how happy they were.In the nightmare door, his sickness is the gateway to this feeling of hopelessness as Death himself pursues you and destroys your world as you run away from him.Final verdict: Buy this game. It's different and it definitely will show you your real feelings about life."

76561198060743195,Not Recommended,310370,29983172,Posted: 17 February,all,RayRemnant,"A really simple and single-minded explorative game. It fails to deliver any meaningful experience rather focusing on the quantity of content than on his quality.The graphics are very unoriginal and have the typical touch of low-end Unity games. I've already seen them many times before, it just fails to impress in any way and exposes the lack of a real effort.Sounds are minimal and awful.The mechanics of the game are very primitive, again, like the graphics, don't have anything unique. Just clicking around until you find the relevant content that you are supposed to find. It's not bad, it's just average, but I don't think ""average"" is worth investing your time into.Now, the ""best"" part of the game is its narrative. Here we can see a collection of different stories about the many perspectives of life. But, sorry to say, even here I can perceive its lack of deep structuring. The stories, like the gameplay, are very generic, but in this case they try to bring a meaningful message that just fails to impress me.There are many games out there that can have an emotional impact even on the most cold-hearted people. Every aspect of the game contributes to this experience, that's why The Way of Life, with its complete average content, falls into the category of games that you will not remember.I appreciate the time the developers spent on this game, but they didn't go in the right direction. It simply can't compete with other really emotional and meaningful games."

Anyways game is little,simple,easy to play, relaxing but the main thing is like its a bit of out-of-box thinking, educative game. I really suggest mostly 'young' guys to play it. Mostly takes an hour.The only down side is yes game is free, but most of the things(levels) are just locked. I dunno if we can buy it, where to buy it, how to buy it. But its locked..."

Relies on cliches that we've seen a million times before. Has really clunky dialogue.It just generally sucksIt relies on just about every cliche you can think of.This game is just garbage"
,Not Recommended,310370,29718011,Posted: 5 February,all,teoska,"Actually I'm not sure whether I recommend the game or not. It deserves a chance to play at least once with respect to the way-out and successful main theme of the game, but my opinions are not so close to absolutely recommending it.Too many things are locked in the free edition, and I can easily claim the core form within the free edition is not so impressive, even it gets more and more boring during gameplay.By the way, old people walk slowly for sure, but the slowness of the aged man here rushes up the boringness I have touched upon."
