All sectors have control points you need to capture in order to advance and eventually make your way to enemy base. During combat you can freely fly in the battlefield, warp into sectors where the combat is currently going on and warp back to base to regroup or to run away with your nearly destroyed ship for repairs.There's currently 15 different ship types in game, 3 of them unlocked right at the start. Ship types fit for many roles: long range, hard hitting sniper boat, heavily armored flagship for more close range combat, sneaky & stealthy assassin ship, fast moving frigate etc. As the game is currently in it's early stages, it understandably might have some balance issues between various ship designs - though I personally feel like every ship has their own use and an organized group will easily take down those solo snipers or assassins who think they can/should be able to kill everything themselves.PROs:Awesome ship designWell made levelGraphics, sfxCONs1(one) levelVery low playerbase (seen max of 54)Level Matching system(isn't one)No real training/tutorialsFor an EARLY ACCESS game, its good, Its not super great, but its really entertaining. Graphics are great, has a solid gameplay. People here are giving it negative reviews because they want a finished product but its no where near that stage yet. The game is great at its current stage and it can only get better from here. I'd definitely recommend this game for anyone who loves space sci-fi."

There isn't any sort of ""pay to win"" aspect of this game. All of the crew packs can be obtained through premium currency (Platinum) or standard currency that you earn in game (Credits). Other purchases are merely cosmetic, they are reskins of the ships. Different paint jobs and the like. Ships can be purchased with Platinum or Credits.The game is fair, and a lot of fun. The AI is actually really good in my opinion and at times can be rather challenging.I highly recommend this game, and I hope the developers keep working on it, adding more ships and *maps* and different crews."

I like that the keyboard commands are not overwhelming (tiny hands!) which allows me to reroute all concentration into the battle itself. Oh and nearly forgot! I love the fact that each ship has its own role/personality!The game aesthetic has improved a lot in the space of a year (Video -not mine- for comparison:https://youtu.be/zQF9q0I-exU) and I know it will just get better.Also, its amazing the level of detail given to the ships, even with the tools they have available, it requires a lot of patience/commitment.Not very often I support an Early Access game because its like gambling but I don't have any disappointments over Fractured Space, was worth the risk and money well spent.I'm looking forward to the future.Best wishes,Rita"

But I saw multiple reviews saying those were from a previous generation of the game, and sure enough, all negative reviews stop around 10 months ago. Since then apparently there have been major updates and improvements, and you can check the updates, the Devs are still very active. That said, this may be an early access game, but it doesn't much feel like it. There are at least 2 or 3 dozen ships to choose from, and the games runs at a minimum of 60 fps for me, more often at around 70 or 80.If you want a legitimate, space battlecruiser fighting game, give it a shot. After just 3 days I have completely fallen in love with this game, and there is enough depth and variation between each game that I don't see it getting old any time soon. If you like LoL, Smite, or any other Mobas (I don't really care for them, but I love this game), then bite the bullet and give it a try. But make sure to do the tutorials."

These are all very basic and I will assume what you spend will be expanded in the future, like upgrading just your engines  or buying stronger lasers etc. Right now thats all stat based.Loadouts are very basic at the moment with only a few options for weapons and abilites.There are 6 ships out as of now, but all have a unique playstyle and can counter each other, for example assassins have a inital advantage vs flagships due to there long range weapons, but up close a flagship will be able to do much more damage.The performance sadly is were this game falls short, I have a GTX 760 and 8GB of ram and im struggling, but im sure this will be patched out in time.TL;DR Very interesting MOBA style space game, wait for more patches before you buy."

[deaf],"Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of HearingOverall Rating: 4/10Gameplay Rating: 6/10 - simple, fun gameplay; no real explanation for essential aspects of the gameAccessibility Rating: 2/10 - no captions/subtitlesNotesOverall rating is a combination of the gameplay (mechanics and story) and accessibility (how the game includes deaf/hoh gamers).If you disagree with my take on the game or if something is factually incorrect, please leave a comment below!General GameplayThis game is in ALPHA build, early access.  This review covers the game as it was on April 17, 2015 and includes feedback from developers regarding a temporary fix for rebinding keys for gameplay.  I FULLY suspect this rating will improve drastically over time.So far, this appears to be a Control Points type game where you and your team of 4 other players try to capture stations in different quadrants to gain resources for ship upgrades that ultimately help you capture the enemy station.  Both teams fight for control of these stations and team members must work together to simultaneously capture points for your team and prevent the opponent from capturing for theirs.Some Alpha stage problems do exist.- First, it is difficult to get into a server - I often experience a failed join with no explanation as to why that is.- Second, the basics of the game are in place, such as an initial set of ships and crew, but more are to be added, and there are some aspects of crew arrangement that seem to be placeholders for future functionality only.- Third, as it is now, I have not seen any real tutorial for out-of-play experience (such as crew, ship selection and upgrading, and tech tree) to explain the details of what is what.- Finally, the control schema for the game is only accessible outside of gameplay via the Hub interface rather than through game options.On the plus side, the gameplay itself is fluid when you get into it and the currently available game mode is relatively easy to grasp without a steep learning curve.  Further, there is currently a rudimentary technology tree that offers different ships (and different styles of gameplay) based on an in-game credit system that currently requires no micro payments.In its early stages, players seem to still be developing tactics for successful team play and I can see this game improving into something both challenging and fun to play with friends over time.General AccessibilityAccessibility Options+ You CAN edit options before playing the game.+ HOH gamers CAN adjust audio controls separately for master volume, music, effects, and voice.+/- Players with mobility issues can NOT currently rebind keys from inside the game, but the developers will add this feature soon.

It's very exciting as the player base has increased dramatically. While the influx of new blood can be frustrating when new players are grouped with veterans, let us not forget we need a large player base for the game to survive.For the live release the UI has seen significant improvements and the addition of Co-op play vs. AI bots will help to curb the learning curve. Fractured Space has always suffered from a steep learning curve, but that's the price you pay for a game with this level of tactical depth. This isn't ""chess in space"", it's more like ""Axis and Allies in space"". You can enjoy on a casual level, but if you wish to plumb the depths of optimal attack angles and diversionary tactics, that's all there too.Be sure to check out the official Discord server for a community of active players and free voice chat channels. It's remarkable how well a coordinated team can perform over a random assortment of players.Yup, still awesome. Check it out.---------------------------------------------------------------UPDATED: 5 July 2016Well the Alpha 18 release is here and daaaaaamn is it cool. Everything looks better, the game runs smoother, and most importantly MORE SKINS!This release sees the introduction of a super sweet TDS attack ship, the Executioner. If this missile spamming, gauss cannon firing, backwards time blinking, Overdrive blasting sex machine does NOT get you uncomfortably excited, I don't think we can be friends. Sorry.The game seems to run much better now too. During the previous release I would have to wait about 30 seconds staring at a frozen screen before a match would load. That stutter has been completely eliminated in this release, thank the optimization gods.Anyway, the game is still awesome. Give it a try, and be sure to check out the developers stream on Twitch to witness their...uh....""skills"" :p.---------------------------------------------------------------Do you like:- Giant captial ship combat?- Super pretty explosions?- Super super pretty ship skins?- And seriously tactical combat?Then you'll probably like Fractured Space! It's a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) wherein two teams of 5 ships each compete for resources, and attempt to capture each other's home base. A lot of things explode, and it looks gorgeous.Be warned, the current learning curve is pretty steep. There is a tutorial in the game, but it doesn't conver the sheer chaos that can ensure in an actual match. I STRONGLY recommend you check out some guides here on Steam and on Youtube. There are some very good Youtubers out there that break down an entire match step by step.Please keep in mind that this game is still a work in progress. Things will change; sometimes it feels like a step backwards, but invariably the product has increased in quality. Especially the explosions."

Nothing feels quite like seeing a enemy use his missile barrage and than blinking to him and unleashing a full broadside of rockets in his face as his wasted missiles fly out into space. What they have in game now is fun all in itself and I for one am looking forward to the future updates. I have been wnating a game where can fight in capital ships for a long time now. The little details that they have in here is awesome too. When your ship is moving up or strafing left or right little thrusters along the hull can be seen firing. I like the ships style as well. The ships are something that looks like it belongs a hundred years in our future and not like slabs of metal that can shoot from wherever. Your turrets are mounted and can be seen turning and take time to rotate around. A match that I recently played I was flying the Assassin ship, which I believe is a cruiser or a destroyer class vessel. This thing is quite fast and hits pretty hard. Strafing runs are nice in this vessel. I could zoom by enemy capitals faster than thier turrents could track. To the dev's if you see this. Keep up the great work and I cannot wait to see what else you have in store for us."

,Recommended,310380,15287149,"Posted: 9 April, 2015",all,Noriko117,"From what I have picked up so far, it is a Moba of sorts. There are three classes. Support, Defense, and full on assault. Now the pros of the game: Well made so far (sorta).Pros: Supports can defend themselves (unlike other Mobas Ive played) Warps (Teleport) are changed with your class (I think thats Balenced) for example, the supports can warp out in 3 seconds, and the flagships can warp out in 10. Multitude of strains for your ships. Some ships CANNOT take on other ships alone. For Example a support versus a hunter. Support is screwed right? well not exactly, due to the supports superior warping in and out time (3 seconds) they can leave the scene before they come back and finish you off. If you are attcked while warping in or out, you take 500% more damage. So warping out in combat isnt always an option (Tried it ten times at least, got away 2 times total).Cons: Some ships are obviously over powered. For example, the ""Hunter"" (or whatever it is called) can go invisble and are undetectable unless a certain ship is there with the detect ability. Heal beams can heal your enemy too... so thats good if a teammate wont hold still I end of healing the enemy... then we are both dead. It also opens up a portal to troll land. Where all the trolls play supports and heal the enemy (I know right perfect). I was disapointed to hear that I cannot ram my enemy as a last ditch effort for damage. You can ram them sure, but it doesnt do anything. Also hitting astroids at very high speeds... well... you bounce off like a ball on a wall. No damage done to you. On to some other rather important missing feautres. You CANNOT change your key binds (like seriously? WTF). Final Con: No playable tutorial, they provide you with a short video that is not totaly clear, they give objectives nad the main goal, but no real play advice. Long story short: Tutorial almost non-existant.In the end I would have to make my statement and say: This game is not finished (or anywhere near it), it needs serious user support (friends list, keybinds, ect). I did enjoy this game though, and I will be playing more. I do recommend this game to users who like the moba genre. I would give this game at its current state a 6.5/10 (as of 4-10-15)"

I'm a Forerunner from the alpha days and I have to say the FS is nowhere near as enjoyable to play as it was back then. I loved FS for that feeling of captaining a gigantic lumbering capital ship and using its awesome firepower to wipe out my foes, but now after Conquest 2.0 the scale of FS has been completely ruined for me. Maps now feel extremely cramped and there is no sense of strategy anymore thanks to the modified respawn times. Positioning and setting up your attacks are much more of a non-concern now since battles for mines always end up in a huge cluster♥♥♥♥ within minutes of jumping in and penalty for death has been greatly reduced. I think EdgeCase definately achieved their goal of making the game ""faster paced and more action-packed"" but at the cost of the strategic space battle experience.I enjoyed Fractured Space more when each ship had its role and the playing field was equal. I could choose my favorite ship and play skillfuly against other similarly skilled players. Now I have to worry about having to setup the proper crew implants to give me and edge in battle, wich greatly detracts from the overall gameplay experience for me. Implants are just another thing to keep me in the menues reading guides and trying to choose the right ones.Overall, the visuals and sound are amazing and I love the art design. But theres no sense of scale or strategy anymore and it's starting to feel like your typical free-to-play grindfest. For me fractured Space is now in the same boat as Dreadnought from Six Foot and Yager, promising in the early stages but now a huge dissapointment."

The previous size of the map was perfect,  time and room to prepare your advance/attacks, even makes you consider diff. options/routes according to the distance your teamates are from you, now we respawn to close to the action to be given any other choice but to push/rush in. Ok games could last for more than 30 minutes sometimes up to 45 min. But I don't think making less room to play in is the solution. (Starting with making us facing the right way after a jump would have save precious seconds).  Dev. team prefers New Players Retention to making the faithful players happy.  I am affraid the game shall turn out to be like any other Call of Duty. A game without a soul. I could play Fractured space for hours before getting bored. Now with the patch I can barely play 2 games and I am fed up...lost is soul...strategy is gone. You spawn directly where you die, you got no room to create deployment strategies.Just a big Bang-a-rang.  Making such a huge change in the way the game is being approached can only lead to more tweaks required on the ships/class...we all know what happens from there..balance is very hard to maintain in this type of game...Lets hope we dont witness Fractured Space's Downfall this week.What a destructive move...Game' soul was traded for money!With the new patch its a no go for me.At least you don't have to spend a dime to enjoy the whole contnent.

The quickest I've ever found a game is about 3 minutes. Usually the more common scenario is that you'll sit in line to play for 3 minutes and then someone leaves the queue and it causes you to start all over. 10 minutes to find a game seems more realistic. And if your 10th player can't be found the game will occasionally start at 4vs5 which is completely unfair.The game itself has everything I wanted from Eve Online without any of the nonsense like griefing and grinding to get resources. There's 3 base ships they give you to start out and they're all great, I find myself going back and using them after unlocking more advanced ones. Sure there's definitely balance issues but it's still in early access.Now, in my opinion I think the way the devs have focused so much on microtransactions, skins, and premium packages and not on things that are debilitating to the game such as the matchmaking and disconnects that will eventually ruin the game.I sure hope that doesn't happen and that matchmaking will be more streamlined in the future.

So here goes:Fractured Space is a space-MOBA game where you are given command of captial ships, some of which measure more than 2 kilometers in length. In a team of 5 players, you have to defend your home base and your mining stations from the 5 enemy ships in the ensuing massive and sometimes quite frame-costy skirmishes. Teamplay is everything here, unlike your average shooter you can't just say: ""Oh, i got killed there, let's go into the other sector."". This might cost you a match, so if you are looking for a lone wolf style of gameplay, i have to warn you that Fractured Space will not often allow you to play like that. On the other side, if you like to have a team around you that you can (most of the time) count on, this is a game for you.For a while, Fractured Space included 2 different game modes, a ""Conquest"" mode with a map divided into 2 Sectors, your base, the enemy base and the famous Gamma Sector, which will activate in intervalls, granting the team that conquers it a massive boost, and, with the 4th Gamma, access to the opponent's Home Base. Such access can also be gained by opening one of the enemy's froward stations, one in each sector. When the Home Base is fully capped, you win. Or lose depending on which base it was. Your average Conquest game takes about 30 minutes, so be sure to calculate a bit of time for it.The other game mode that is currently locked was called ""Frontline"". It dropped the idea of a Gamma Station and different lanes, and instead went for a more FPS-style approach. An open map with lots of asteroids as cover, 3 mines to cap, jump points distributed all around the map allowing for quick surprise attacks, and a permanent death after 12 minutes of game time. The mode is locked right now and there is no info on when it will be reintroduced, if ever, we will have to wait for a longer time. The Devs are working on it though.Not long ago, the game became free to play, which will hopefully increase the playerbase quite a bit. Although there are lots of buyable assets, it is not necessarily a pay to win game. In the coming updates, the game will move to Unreal Engine 4.1.1, which will drastically increase the stability of the game. Crashes are currently quite common for me, but there is an option to reconnect to the server. Also, expect lengthy waiting times while Matchmaking is looking for a server for you, but you have a small 2D game called ""Fracturoid Extreme"" that will help you make time pass. Or show you how horrible reflexes you have. Sounds hilarious? Maybe...But it is currently the only possible solution, as the playerbase is just too small, and it is just temporary I think.So, what else to say? I would recommend the game to any fan of Battlestar Galactica instantly. The depth of the gameplay and big picture thinking is something unique, and the only comparable game named ""Dreadnought"" doesn't offer you this.See you on the battlefield!"

Previously you could just buy the crewmembers you liked with normal ingame currency. Now you have to draft them from 'drop pods', which give you a random crewmember of varying rarity and power. Or sometimes no crewmember at all, instead pitifully small credit bonuses or DNA...what's DNA? Well! In order to use a crewmember after you drafted them, you still have to use DNA to actually unlock them. How do you get DNA? Why, only through openeing yet more drop pods, of course!And how do you get droppods? Well, they come in 3 rarities. Each one exceedingly more costly in ingame currency. Or you could just spend a hundred bucks and buy 110 drop pods. Which won't even get you all the crewmembers. Bargain, right?"

If you're into pure space sims, of which there aren't that many of, then you might be a little surprised by Fractured Space.Fractured Space, at its core, is a MOBA. It has more in common with LoL or DoTA than space combat sims. In fact, I'd hesitate to call this a space sim. I simply say that because, while yes, you do control huge starships with a variety of weapons and 'abilities', and yes the armour on each side of your starship is tracked, other than that the game doesn't really try to go into any deeper 'simulation'. Movement is entirely free, but it's not realistic in terms of space physics. Your health is tracked by a simple number.In many ways you'll find traditional LoL/DoTA mechanics 'translated' so that they make sense on a sci fi starship theme. If you've played Beyond Earth, you'll probably understand that already.I bought into the game not really sure what to expect, and I'm not a MOBA fan. I don't enjoy LoL or DoTA. At first I was disappointed at what appeared to be fairly shallow sim mechanics, but the deeper and more interesting parts of the game lie in teamwork and co-ordination, as well as pulling off a successful move or combo that sends your opponent up in flames.TLDR; from my perspective, even though it's a bit disappointing for someone who was expecting an in-depth multiplayer starship sim game, it can still be incredibly fun as a space themed MOBA and will be a totally viable alternative in the MOBA market when it releases.I would recommend, though, that unless you wish to directly support the developers, avoid 'buying' the game before it releases. Simply my opinion on F2P games that require purchase to access early-access. It's early, it's not finished and is a little content light at the moment."

Don't take my thumb's down as a commentary on the gameplay.The F2P model has been wearing on me recently and though I might be incorrect it seems as if players can purchase methods that have an impact on gameplay and the mechanics of conflict. Things that affect more than just aesthetics. If that premise holds true than I really couldn't be bothered to devote a lot of hours to this game to try and figure out if that makes a meaningful difference or not. I feel bad saying that but I have just been a little burned out on F2P models lately.----------Original hasty review published after a slight frustration:I am so tired of free-to-play games, logging into servers, trying to dissect the monetary model, and slow-burn progression systems.Those ideas are just ruining and spoiling what otherwise would be fun games.Sigh."

I've always loved space shooters, but I got tired of saving the galaxy in a starfighter. Capital ship combat is where my heart is.The game at this point consists of 5v5 rounds that generally last from 10-25 minutes. There is a decent variety of ships to choose, but they must be unlocked with experience. Despite other reviews, I don't think it takes overly long to unlock the various ships (I'm up to 10 or so at 30hrs). Subjectively, I'm unlocking ships on here faster than I'm unlocking tanks of WoT. I'm having fun unlocking ships, and it doesn't feel like a grind to me. There are multiple classes of ships to support multiple playstyles, and the dev's seem good about balancing and re-balancing during this stage. Despite the fact that the ships don't maneuver as fast as in starfighter type games, the game still has a speedy pace. The direction of battle can shift wildly at a moments notice. You can be on the verge of losing one moment, then snatch victory from the jaws of death with great teamwork.I love it. Sure, there are problems, but this game is still in testing. I like the direction that the game devs are taking it, and they are constantly working on it.Pros:Beautiful graphics.Fun 5v5 combat.Variety of ships.Game is well optimized for online play. I rarely experience lag issues at server end.Cons: **remember, this is early access**Small playerbase means you generally wait 3 minutes for a matchMatchmaker needs work.Currently no provision to join a match in progress.

Those are actually good things, considering it's still in early access stages. It's almost like playing a complete game already. The lack of content and instruction isn't as noticable after you jump in and play for a bit. The general pacing of matches seems quite on par with what you'd expect with 'capital ship' combat. Ships are very slow to turn, and can take a bit of a beating before going down, depending on which class you play. Depending on whether battles get much larger in the future, the potential for even more mayhem is welcome. For now, it's restricted to smaller, more tactical matches. I'm liking the classes as well, they seem fairly balanced at this point, at least until upgrades come out. I'm really hoping this one avoids the 'pay 2 win' stigma that haunts so many other class based team games out there now."

Content in menu is so far very limited, but game is capable of being played and provides excellent audiovisual experience.Also, I have to say, that guns do have sound effects according to their nature, strong canon shows ""recoil"" sound efffect. I know, there is the vacuum in the space, but it is very important for players to feel the power of the weapon and this is present here. Strategy is a key for winning  and community is good so far.There has been a wipe to set everyone equal starting conditions after bringing economics to the game. You have to earn reputations with manufacturers and unlock new ships and loadouts, I rate this as positive feature, which is still being evaluated and getting better.Free weekend had a great impact on community grow and new players are seeking for new stratiegies with a help of veteran players. Also in-game shop emerged, content will be released soon. These changes increased requirements for the servers, so you can expect some engine glitches and a need of lower resolution, but this is only a temporary issue. Also be preparde for increased effort to play together, because servers are filling fast and team matchmaking is to be implemented soon.Also, teamplay is now crucial for the victory and even with basic loadout you can do pretty messy things. But forget about one single overpowered ship. Good combination can beat anything, solo ships are sentenced to be easily neutralized.I recommend this for everyone, who had ever desired to command his own ship and lead it to a furious battle.Note, that this is an Early Access Game. Be ready for bugs and features in development, creators are eager to discuss and implement it in patches. If you are not willing to contribute in developing the game, better wait for full release."

The starter ships are also pretty decent and I still use them on occasion.Not being able to party up with all your friends kinda sucks, but I understand the reasoning of not wanting 5 man slamdowns of 5 people paired up who can communicate and such.The game is fun in and of itself, I wish the ships felt bigger though. They move too fast and just seem like oversized toys to me, which is no fault of the models, they're gorgeous, it just seems like toys fighting each other sometimes. More small stuff for scale would be nice I suppose (more visible machineguns for point defense, more fighters, etc).But really, when you're in a full team battle to the end for gamma or a home base and all the ships are close together slogging it out, it's a damn fun game and I highly recommend it, especially now that it's free.I've only encountered one or two squeakers and most of the time everyone is nice and happy to help, so the community, while a bit small at the moment (although I've never had the egregious match finding time problems others report, perhaps it's because I'm in the US East?

One kill benefits all of you equally, and as a result you must make smarter decisions if your team is behind in levels.Matchmaking is relatively slow and occasionally you'll have one or two outclassed members on a team, but this is likely to improve with more players in the matchmaking system.At the very least, it's free.

I love capital ships in games, and this game doesn't disappoint.  Some have compared it to a MOBA, but its more like a team-based shooter like TF in space.  Once I got the controls down, gameplay was pretty smooth, and the strategies and tactics started becoming apparent.Pros:  Gameplay is very fun, there's a TON of potential here.  With care, it could become a real hit.   Battlefield ""terrain"" (asteroids) was actually very useful for me for the first time in a space game, ducking and rushing from cover to cover.  Good teamwork leads to victory; smaller ships are useful too (I just helped win a game in a frigate because I could run and hide, eventually rushing in to cap the enemy base.)  Doesn't seem pay-to-win...yet.  Games are relatively quick but deep, they seem to have hit a sweet spot as far as game length goes.Cons: Only 5v5?  C'mon, lets have 10v10 or more - the EPIC space battles that would result would be amazing.  Really small ships like the corvette are useless; they're so fragile that in a 5v5 game, even though they have some healing powers and team buffers, they die so fast that they're not worth taking.  But in bigger games, smaller ships like the corvette could become a real asset, as the more targets increase their chances of survivability.  With so few ships on a side, it seems like ships like the Hunter and Sniper are especially powerful.In the end, it boils down to the question - ""Am I having fun?""  In short, yes.  I'm an older gamer and have played a lot of space games over the years.  Some were great, some were frustrating and some were just awful.  This one is a very fun game that I hope will get better as they move on to beta and beyond."

Sadly lacking currently in the player population department as well but I haven't had too much difficulty finding a game.Gameplay is fairly slow and methodical, but in my opinion manages to capture this certain 'visceral' feel with impressive visuals and sound design. Ships feel very hefty and powerful.In it's current state (as of the time of writing), there are 6 ships (with a small amount of customisation) and one map/game mode (the aforementioned standard MOBA type game mode). It's a small start, but the things that are already there are promising.I've heard of others complaining about poor optimisation and sudden framerate drops but I have yet to experience anything of the sort. It may be worth looking into though if you are on a lower end system.For the $10 asking price, I'm happy with the product, especially considering the prospect of more maps, game modes and features in the future.

I love how every ship looks and feels very unique so far and how they all have unique weapons and abilities. There is also a nice tech tree for abilities that allows for players with the same model ship to still be different in that they have upgraded there ship differently or have different crew members operating it. I think allowing players to feel unique is crucial to the success of any game, so i'm glad to see it present in Fractured Space.I would like to see more ships developed as well as more crew options, there are really only 2 options per position atm. I would also like to see map variations, i think it would be refreshing and would also add an element of planning strategy according to the map. The the strategy in combat is somewhat simplistic and i think this game would greatly benefit if it were 10 v 10 instead. then combat would be more exciting and you would really start to see the benefits of having a combination of ""healers"", ""tanks"" and dps ships. The ships move so slowly that once you realize you can't win a fight you're pretty much screwed as those decisions need to be made before even engaging, unless you have blink - which needs to be nerfed, the cooldown is too low. Also, you would have to weigh a much higher risk to pursue a fleeing target if the teams were larger. Currently, most skirmishes are only between 2 and 3 ships because you need to split up to capture and defend sectors so devs please consider increasing the team size.Anyway i really see alot of potential for this game to be successful.

You'll find yourself enjoying the simple space combat, timing your shields between cover and the anticipation of that desperately needed missle barage. It's quite a spectacular game to take in: beautiful graphics, the perfect sounds, you can even see the detail of individual turrets and thrusters working as you command your vessel. The issues however, that despite the enjoyable gameplay, its repetitive with little motivation to play frequently.To the dev: so far my experience has been a pleasant one, however more often than not, if one side starts to lose everyone jumps ship and leaves just a few players to fend for themselves. If there were credits to spend on customization of say crew or appearance, or maybe even equipment (keep it balanced please) then players might actually stick around. Or perhaps when one side starts to win there could be some sort of balancing feature like faster respawns for the losing team. As it is when one team starts to dominate the field, they're the winners. Also I hope to see more done with the crew slot aspect of the ship other than voices. Perhaps a slow combat regen, faster jumps, faster captures. It would be nice if your tactical leader have more purpose besides base cap as well, capturing an enemy ship perhaps using boarding pods ? Also it would be nice to gear up your ship how you like but they have a 1-2 locked abilities/ weapons + stats including what already exists, but perhaps add in targeting systems that allow for faster turret turning and accuracy increases. Finnally some sort of engine overdrive that isnt the ftl, would greatly increase the gameplay speed and skill involved, not saying make it a fighter jet, but some sort of depletable bar."

Games can get hectic and you can win or lose a close match by a fraction. You also don't need to worry about unlocking ships right away if you're a new player, as the other ships aren't better or more powerful than the ones you start with, merely different. The Venturer is particularly good in the right hands.This isn't a FPS. You don't join a game and just fly around shooting the enemy (even though some new players think that's what you do). No, you use your ship's strengths to help your team capture the mines, gamma and eventually the enemy base. Kills and combat are ultimately secondary to those goals and theoretically a game can be won without anyone ever firing a shot at the enemy ships.Combat is fun though, and you will be fighting often.

Allow that to bare some weight on this, my one of few reviews.  I write it because I want Fractured Space to be successful, I feel it deserves to be.  You should too.8 out of 10.  Thats what I would honestly rate Fractured Space at this point.  It has a lot of replayability in the 30+ starships available and each one of them that I have tried (about 15 or so) feels and plays differently than the last.  That is one of the strengths and source of appeal to me; the fact that there doesn't feel to be cookie cutter mechanics and easy-way-outs in the ship design.  Some ships are better at specific roles than others, but each ship has an effective part to play.The MOBA style gameplay found on 1 of the 2 game modes (with a unique twist in the ""Gamma Sector"") works for it pretty well, it adds sufficient depth to strategy while the maps themself make positioning and team work a very important factor.  With that said, winning a match against an otherwise stacked team is very possible if they let their guard down.  A single ship has the potential of pulling off a victory if timing and a little luck is on its side.  I think this adds to the games sense of hope when situations seem dire.This game has been in development since 2014. I got involved in late 2015 as a founder after watching its development and seeing sufficient progress towards solid gameplay.  Since I have got involved, the progress has evolved into something that is fun to play and very much invokes the ""easy to learn, hard to master"" feeling with a pretty high skill-cap on some roles in specific ships, especially with a team that works together.Be all that as it may, it is a work in progress and it isn't perfect.  But it is my opinion that its got a lot of potential to be that game everybody has heard of, a lot have played, and many have enjoyed.  It's going to take exposure and player-base to do that and that is why I reccomend that you download and play Fractured Space.  It's free-to-play and there is no pay-to-win."
76561198006573232,Not Recommended,310380,14414549,"Posted: 10 February, 2015",all,Warhawke,"Overall a very mediocre game. Graphics are decent, sounds boring, simplistic gameplay, painful control scheme.Gameplay is overly simplistic with far less options than typical fps or moba style games. This is primarily left-click or right-click on a target to shoot and like 1 or 2 very uninspired special attacks. Capturing stations is simply a matter of flying near them as they are all completely undefended. The level up system is also rather simplistic and yields little more than bonus hps and damage. Loadouts are also uninspired with weapon options having little more variety than for example average laser, laser that shoots fast and does lless damage and big laser that shoots slow and does extra damage; nothing that really affects your gameplay in an substantial way.Ships are surprisingly weak for a game that bills itself on capital ship duels which tends to make the game feel very fps-ish. Many battles are over in just a few shots. Many movie/tv battle sequences last longer and they are paying like $1M a minute for cgi. This might be ok for if it was a fighter sim but feels totally wrong in a capital ship context. Also, the respawn timers are far too long making for too much idling. Ship balance is also very poor for an early access game that has been out this long. The support type ships seem generally unplayed and unuseful.Immersion is very poor due to virtually no consistency in the styling of the various ships. They all look decent but there is little stylistic consistancy like they were just ripped at random fromcoolspaceships.comor someting. Many of the battles take place at ranges where its difficult to even make out the appearance of the ships so you feel like you are mostly just attacking hitboxes.Currently, in Early Access there is only 1 map and once again it is a very uninspired symetrical 2-lane map.The only victory condition is to cap your opponents home base. Unfortunately, they made a very dubious design decision in that there is no way to decap your home base meaning that rushing the enemy base is a pretty easy win especially with the short cap time needed and really long respawn timers. Its not unusual to see matches end after simply 1 or 2 clashes not much room for strategy or comebacks.Hopefully the game gets better - there is certainly some potential here."

It's been in my library for quite some time since I initially played it for an hour.I'm glad I gave it a second try now. It's rapidly becoming one of my favourite games at present.I am not going to go into all the gameplay and mechanics that make it good. There's plenty of reviews that do that. Read them. What makes this game great, is the tactical element. The way the maps are designed requires teamwork and coordination. The different types of ship require you to make a balanced well rounded team if you want to prevail. Also each ship requires it's own tactics and play style.  Battles can be quick and brutal or protracted drawn out affairs. They are often intense and require constant monitoring of the ebb and flow of battle. If you think you are going to be able to jump into a ship and charge into battle, think again. That's the thing, the game requires you to think.So far a good community. Nearly all the players I meet are friendly. One or two ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s as usual but that's to be expected. The Dev team seem active and attentive. Always a huge plus.  You have no reason not to get this game, it's free. Sure you can spend real money on it, but you don't have to. Grab it and join in. You likely won't regret it."

It may take a few minutes to get started, but that's even true of player-count juggernauts like Call of Duty.Fractured Space has interesting and fairly balanced gameplay. Every ship is relevant in some way, but choosing the right ship for the task always matters. Ping is almost irrelevant in matches - I've experienced no difference in gameplay between 40 and 350 ping. It's in early alpha, so there are a few problems that are typical of that sort of thing, but they're mostly addressed quickly and effectively.There's one final progression wipe coming on the 21st of January, so playing before then might suck a bit if you don't want the exclusive skins they give as a reward for high-levels prior to the wipe.

However in this game the grind is more enjoyable. It's basically an Arena MOBA without minion laning, instead it's a 5v5 match with taking objectives and preparing to meet in the middle for an all out clash every few minutes to gain a powerful buff.This can be a fun pick up and play type of game, I did find it a bit of a letdown there is only 1 actively played map, and the playerbase appears to be dwindling slowly once you get into the higher ratings, but there is still plenty of action in the lower ELO levels."

,Recommended,310380,23343664,"Posted: 2 June, 2016",all,N0ps,"This review is being made after the April update that rendered the game Free to Play and introduced the case system. i should also put a disclaimer saying that I bout into the Alpha and bought the highest priced package at the time, so there might be some bias.First of, I would like to respond to some of the more vocal fans of the game that are complaining about the case system and claiming it's now a pay to win game. No. Some try to mislead you by saying that all but the starter crew are locked off and that this is causing a huge imbalance as people who pay unlock different crew. They are correct, you can only get the starter crew and do need to grind or pay to get other crew, but this does not affect game balance in any significant way. All crew are side-grades from each other, and while ships work better with crew that compliment their abilities, the affect is minimal and any specialized ship will lose something for it's upgrades. Any specialized ship can still be taken down by a starter crewed ship easily if that ship is used right.Now that I got that out of the way, onto the review. Fractured Space is a unique game, taking elements from MOBAs and vehicle battle games like World of Warships, and for the sake of adding it in, Hero Shooter like Overwatch and Battleborn with the latter having a higher resemblance. The game relies heavily on team work, the correct ship composition and very heavily on how good yo are with your ship. The game can be a grind as you need EXP and DNA to earn ships and crew, but the starter ships give you everything you need for a fair and balanced team that can hold of most teams. Ships can be earned with EXP, which you get by playing games in ships of the same tech tree, and crew are acquired as random drops that you get in crates that also require DNA to craft. While the crew system is abhorrent, it doesn't affect the game that much and is the only major downside and is not as bad as others will have you think.For an Alpha game, Fractured space shows a lot of promise and already lives up a lot of praise it gets. The gameplay is solid, although the UI needs some tweaks before release, and it looks amazing with the Unreal Engine. If you're into it, you could easily lose weeks to this game, and it hasn't even come out yet! Of the games flaws, other than the crate system, many of them are not the games fault. There still appear to be a massive amount of new players that don't know much about the game mechanics and the tutorial is still in need of touching up so that player will also learn how to synergize with their team mates. The two game modes are fun, although I have not played any Frontline and am basing that opinion on what I have seen, and it is always fun to ram your colossus into a disabled enemy Ghost. Overall, I recommend you get this game."

Having played a few hours now I can say with confidence it's a brilliant game. The ships are all unique from what I have tried and every match brings intense battles.There seems to be something for everyone like any MOBA. You can go full on assault, support, sniper, tank and even assassin (Which is my fave at the minute)I have actually gone ahead and bought the extra DLC I enjoyed it that much.Cons:The only real con I see at the minute is the servers are not very populated, it doesn't effect anything as matches start easily within a couple of minutes of joining a lobby but I just hope more people give this brilliant game a chance.^ Fixed now the game is out"

Me still playing the game should give credit to my positive review of it, so instead  of talking about the game, I'll talk about some reviews I'm seeing from people with under 10 hours. From my own experience, this game is in no way pay to win. Sure, it takes time to unlock those high tier ships, but trust me, it's for your own benifit. I've never once felt the urge to pay for a ship in this game, so don't let those people make you think it's something it's not. It's more of a warframe like grind, though nowhere close to as grindy as that game. Everything is unlockable in game. The only other major problem right now(besides drones still being under developement) is the lack of playerbase. The matchmaking system is great, but there aren't enough people playing right now. I hope that it going free to play helps newcomers come in, and for those longtime players in there(you know who you are and what you say in chat) how about you try being a little nicer to people getting into the game?

NOTE THAT ABOUT THIS REVIEW!!This game need ALOT of fixing and adding if its going to be worth anything.However.. I will give an easy setup of good and bad parts of this so far.Positive:- Good space mechanics: It feels like you are flying a massive ship in space. Which is good cause its a space combat sim.- Ships and critical points: There are ship classes that are somewhat ballanced. Some unfair (looking at the cloak and short range 1 hit kill switch one) , but it all makes it better when you can damage parts of ships and take even MOAR damage!- Combat: Combat is slow, yet fast. Its like I have said.. It feeeeels like a space game that you see in Homeworld and typical space games/sci fi games. Cannons takes time to turn and same does the ships. Its like Star Conflict done more realistic.NEGATIVE PARTS!!!- Cloak and short range weapons: Probably the most broken ship in the game. Dont remember the name of the ship (assault I think), BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE!! It is stupid. Compare to the Sniper class, this ship is broken and either needs a huge nerf or be terminated.- The game outside graphics and game mechanics: Apparently from what I see, its going to be a MMO PVP MOBA ish game. It also has a cheap version of Star Conflict with the lobby. From what I see, there will be only online gaming with this game and no PVE.- Gamemodes: Capture the enemy headquarters... oooooooooh thats boring... that is the only gamemode at this point. OOOOOOH THAT IS BORING!There is really not much to say about this game, cause there is almost nothing in this.Its not a bad game, just feel the DEVS are holding it back. ALOT. They could have added Deathmatch, team deathmatch or anything else to make it more fun, or even have more variants that are not so ""straight out of the class system book of any mmo / RPG game"".Owell.

76561198007947984,Not Recommended,310380,32034795,Posted: 28 May,all,Varivox,"A decent to good game ruined by some annoying mechanics and a small, rather hostile, playerbase with limited variety.Good:Gameplay (overall) is really good. The ships are slow and require some patience. They are supposed to be big hulking capital ships. The combat is pretty good as well.Bad:Variety. 2 modes, conquest and frontline. Conquest has 2 lanes towards the enemy base with a middle lane for a bonus fight every few minutes. Frontline is... basically the same thing, but with only one lane and no middle bonus fight mechanic. So, you have 2 modes that both have the same/similar mechanics and objectives. If you don't like one mode, you won't like the other.Ships (stealth). Some ships have stealth, which, in and of itself, isn't a ""bad"" thing. The problem is that they drag the game down and are just unfun to play against. Games like Dota2 do ""stealth"" right, where you have some heroes who counter stealth in and of themselves (which this game has) but they also have items you can buy and deploy to reveal those heroes (which this game doesn't have). So, if the enemy team drafts a team (you can't switch ships mid match and you can't see what the enemy is bringing) and you don't have one of the few ships that have a reveal skill, you are SoL. Double (or tripple) the frustration when compared to Dota2 because you also have a 3 dimensional space your stealthed enemy could be. It's just not a good game setup as it has locked in ships where you can't see the enemy's draft but no option to counter if you don't draft one of those few counter ships yourself.Sound. Game audio is mediocre. Ship fire sounds rather lackluster.Playerbase. It's no secret that the game suffers from a lack of players. The problem is that in the few recent pvp matches I've played, people are rather hostile. That might not be an issue if the game had a decent playerbase, but if you run into someone you don't like, be prepared to see them in the next 20 matches because odds are you'll fight them again and again. Beyond that, finding a match, for me, has taken everything between 1 minute and 10.Grind. Unlocking ships doesn't seem so ""bad"" but I also bought into the game's early access and so had a lot of credits stored up. However, ships range between 300k credits and ~1mil credits while you earn about 10-15k each match. It just feels like too much of a grind for me, and that's before you buy the sidegrades for the weapons and abilities the ship might have.Menu. OMG I HATE THE MENU SYSTEM IN HERE!!!! Such a pain to visit the ""hanger"" and find a ship as you have to scroll through a small little menu window to find it. There are some filters, but they don't help as much as you'd think. Overall, the menues are all convoluted and fill up way too much of the screen offering too little information and still managing to feel overwhelming.Overall, the gameplay is good, but it feels like half a game with some rather unfortunate design decisions."

76561197998698242,Recommended,310380,16538848,"Posted: 19 June, 2015",all,Tigerfish,"Fractured Space: An Early Access Review - 20th June 2015I don't usually buy Early Access games. In fact, I've been burned several times before and swore to never buy another, yet Fractured Space looked so beautiful in the videos and screenshots I saw, that I couldn't resist picking it up in the Steam Summer Sale. Because this review is Early Access, please bear in mind it's likely to become obsolete as the devs continue to work on the title.Fractured Space is a 5v5 multiplayer game, in which two teams start at opposing sides of a 'map' set in space. There are two routes down the map (Alpha and Beta), and the goal of the game is to control the various fixed outposts down these routes to gain access to the Enemy base. Once the enemy base is captured, the game is won. As both teams have the same objective, clashes within Alpha and Beta force players to think carefully; playing offensively or defensively depending on the enemy's position.When your ship dies, you respawn back in your base and so need to weigh up which side is strategically best; whether to move down an already dominated side, or defend the other from approaching enemy ships. Quite often I've seen badly coordinated teams all move down one side and miss the enemy capturing all the points down the other; a move which usually results in the main base losing some capture points.The visuals are beautiful and the ship models are very nicely rendered. Plasma fires ripple down your hull as a barrage of laser shots, from some unseen foe, strikes you suddenly, catching you unawares. The audio is impressive too, with the occasional comment from your AI crew, the immersive thudding of flak fire from the Flagship, or even lightning fast laser fire from a Brawler class.Now on to the bad points (which, as the title is Early Access, will possibly/probably be ironed out in future updates). Firstly, in running an EVE Online group, I have several players that want to play Fractured Space with me. Although we can join the game together, there is no guarantee that you'll be on the same side. You can elect to switch sides at the beginning, but this often fails to work as the game auto-balances the teams before the action begins. Whilst I can appreciate the reason behind this, it often results in frustration as friends go up against each other, instead of being able to work together.Each ship has a role, and the roles are all varied. There are snipers, brawlers, destroyers, carriers, corvettes, etc. As you earn experience from each fight, you can unlock more advanced ships and better equipment to install on them. At present there are three tiers of ships, from three different factions, but the upgrade options are a little sparse on the tier two and three ships. Some are just stock loadouts, with no further upgrade possibilities. I suspect, however, that the game devs are working to implement further ships and fittings in future updates, so I wouldn't be too concerned about this for the moment. That said, even without an update to this, it takes little away from the base gameplay, which can often be very intense. The grind for these tier two and three ships isn't too bad either, and I've managed to unlock most in just 16 hours of play.The game lasts until the enemy base is captured, as previously stated, be that 5 minutes, 10, 15, 20... Getting a quick game in before bed isn't always a wise move, as leaving a game before the end results in a reward of negative 'honorable conduct' - a move, I dare say, introduced to prevent people leaving games once one team has a distinct advantage over another. In the last two days, I've occasionally found myself on a team fighting 4v5 because someone left the game early. With the teams only consisiting of 5 players per side, the loss of a 5th player makes a great deal of difference to the dynamic of a team - especially with sometimes lengthy respawn timers.In conclusion, my friends and I have had a great deal of fun from this game thus far. There are naturally things that the game devs could work on to further improve the game, but as it remains Early Access, it gives the devs the opportunity to do just that.Should the devs read this review, I would suggest that allowing players the opportunity to work on the same team should be something they spend time investigating as a matter of priority. I would also consider the merits of allowing players to change out their ship choice once a battle has started, as often an enemy team consisting of a Brawler and Sniper combination is often hard to counter, and if you pick your ship class poorly, any battle is just an inevitable waste of time as you slog towards the foregone conclusion of defeat."
,Recommended,310380,19065524,"Posted: 13 November, 2015",all,Stare's Sex Slave,"Lovely game, and it's barely in freaking alpha. I would really recommend the developers just embrace the MOBA theme just as they do the space theme, it would make for a pleasureable experience and also attract an already humongous MOBA community.The sectors idea is very nice and creative, but adding more of a lane feature like constant influx of computer NPC's that the capital ships can farm can generate a better ""farming"" instance besides the capturing of mines. The lanes could kind of interfere with how the mines are placed in the map, but a good way to counter this is maybe just having the lanes go straight through the middle of the three mines in the sector, therefore creating the ""NPC lane"" of a traditional MOBA.  The lanes would consist of small fighters and the occasional sisge-like small patrol cruiser. In most MOBA's they would be the creeps and the occasional siege catapult or engine. These NPC units would serve to finally give the player capital ships their real scale of masiveness. The capital ships are supposed to be impending flying space fortresses. This is definetely nailed in the Star Wars game Empire at War which has amazing space battles that ended up with me looking for something similar in Fractured Space. The varying types of ships serve to give the Mon Calamari and Star Destroyers the scale they deserve. This might be an excellent example since I know this studio was partially inspired on their previous game, Zero Suit, by the tremendous universe that is Star Wars. The varying scales of the ships fighting in Empire at War space battles added a way more epic feeling not only for the scale, but also the complexity of the conflict, the firepower and chaos.The Gamma sector is definetely very cool, serves in what in LoL would be the Baron and in Dota Roshan to gain extra bonuses for your team.Upgrades could be diversified a lot, maybe creating a sort of shopping list in forward and main bases to upgrade a ship better. For instance, upgrades that you want to choose to adapt to a situation. Armor agaisnt sniper-like overseer ships would be interesting for a Heavy class capital ship and therefore serve in balancing out any problems their might be with balancing ship classes in game. This would definetely be an area to do a lot of work and thinking on, there exist many possibilities which the developers should definetely take advantage on and expand.Overall, great game, would gladly play waaaaaaay more from now on, and I love the dedication it is recieving.

(Think LoL in space.) It is however, a very unique MOBA; it is very different from say, LoL or DOTA, and it's not just because it's in space.Right now, there are not very many ships to choose from, but this is likely to change as the game develops. ""Creeps"" or ""minions"" are replaced by stations that have to be captured and ""towers"" are replaced by simple damage taken when you're in range of the enemy base. Upgrades, as of now, consist only of gathering resources from captured stations and gaining a universal upgrade every level gained. This will probably be changed to specific upgrades later. The middle fuel station buff is extremely helpful, so get that when you can. Warping in a fight is dangerous as it leaves you extremely vulnurable to damage. Choose the right time to warp. Teamwork is essential to victory, and this is tied to having a team with balanced ship types. A well coordinated attack can completely turn the tide of a game and to that end, use the warp paths wisely. Controls may seem sluggish or sticky, but this is mostly due to ship stats. This brings up the important point, know your ship! The strengths and weaknesses of each ship are made very clear after a few games. Knowing the capabilities of each ship during a fight can make the difference between wiping the enemy team and a 60 second respawn.The game asks a lot from your computer on the performance end. Lag is also a pretty big problem right now. Connecting to the servers is always a gamble and crashes happen quite frequently. These things are likely to be fixed in timeThe game is still in alpha, so don't expect this to be anything close to the final product. A lot of what I consider cons will likely change later on.TL;DR Pros-ConsPros:+Solid gameplay+Clear strengths and weaknesses between ships and loadouts+Teamwork a must+Great, detailed ship graphics(Alpha)+/- No way to cancel warp jumps (Alpha?)Cons:-High computer performance demand-Crashes 1/5 times (Alpha)-Few ship choices (Alpha)-Disconnect/can't connect to server 1/5 times (Alpha)"

,Recommended,310380,14301393,"Posted: 2 February, 2015",all,RealSpooky22,"From what I've played so far, I am quite impressed. it's worth pointing out that this is in Alpha, so a lot of features are missing, but I'll update my review as the game evolves. For now, let's focus on what is actually there.Pros:+ Capitol ships are huge, and insanely fun to pilot+ Great effects for a game at this stage+ Great core gameplay+ The reward; nothing beats the feeling of single handedly anihilating a Flagship closing on your base in your teeny-tiny little Frigate+ Each ship works differently, and has very clear strengths and weaknesses+ The fact that you can use 3 dimensions in each sector (similar to lanes) makes tactical manouvres far mor rewarding.+ SpaaaaaaaaceCons:- Servers range from ""tolerable"" to ""how did I get here, exactly?"" levels of lag- Only one map/skybox- Some issues with mouse tracking, especially in Sniper Mode- Hiding behind asteroids at the far end of a sector you just jumped to because the opposite end has two Snipers decimating your team way out of range of your weaponry- Some movement controls seem to get lost, like when turning right I sometimes stop accelerating deespite holding W down firmly- Textures are a bit... ""conservative"" as of now. Everything looks kinda like Lego- Some ships/upgrades are locked (assumed to be added in updates)- Level/XP/Credits mean nothing/have no use as of yet- Minimap takes a bit of getting used to- No description of weapons/abilities (I moved my Frigate from Kingfisher Missles to a SKUA Torpedo and had literally no clue what it did. Still don't. Moved back to KF's since I could actually see those.)- Snipers. A well-placed pair of Snipers will wreck you. The damage:range ratio is through the roof, and they still have more health than some other close range attack craft- The Assassin follows the issue I said above, with lower health than the Sniper and a lower damage output. Surely the point of an assassin would be to get in ASAP,hit a ship in it's weakspot for MASSIVE DAMAGE, and jump to a safe distance?- No smaller AI enemies (not sure if this is planned or not)- Fleet ""upgrades"" are poorly explained in game (I saw my health go up once, but I have no idea about other parameters/buffs)That's everything so far.Don't let the cons put you off, I'm just trying to be honest.Yes, there are issues, but what you get as of this moment is a well put-together, fairly barebones 5v5 experience where you fly giant capitol ships through space and into other ships, where you shoot them with your cool weapons, with one of you inevitably being reduced to a really cool heap of smoldering wreckage.

You are in charge of a large spaceship where you have to decide where to postition yourself and when you fire to get the most out of your weapons/abilities.

Graphics, effects and models are fantastic with improvements to quality and performance every major update. Having more local servers would be nice (to reduce ping) but its quite easy to find a game. With each update the game gets better and better.Overall a great game, essentialy a moba in space with large spaceships with flashy battles. Love to see how this develops.

This game is in a infant state.Thanks.Early Access Thoughts:I must say that I have participated in a few Early Access games. For the amount of content that is available, at this very moment, is already worth my 10$.1: DetailAlready in its early state, Fractured Space has some good eye candy. There is some things that are placeholders, Im sure. But, so far, it is very nice looking. The ship explosions are some of the best I have seen for a space game. It looks just as I would think a explosion in space would look like. The asteroids look quite well done. (I am hoping that the ""Main Base"" doest stay like it is. Looks more like a fighting ring, than a ""main Base""..lol)2: ShipsThey are going for more of a team play mechanic. So you have your Heavy, Med, and Light crafts. Then you have some different ""Roles"" tied into the ships as well. From a sniper, to a close up ""run and gunner"". Plus there is support class ships. Like a healer, and one that can disable a enemy. Very versitile, and logical, how the dev's have planed so far.3: Game PlayYou have two teams. Fighting for control of Five ""Sectors"". (Which is quite large) Two ""Home Bases"", that are the ""Primary"" capture point.The ships fly by using w/a/s/d/q/e.(sitting still will get you killed..lol) Space bar will raise you, while CTRL will lower you. You aim, zoom in(like ADS), and scroll in and out to zoom, with your mouse. There is a health bar on the Hud, around the cursor/reticle. Your abilites are on the numbers. You hold shift to pick a near jumpoint. (The animation for the jump does need some work. Which Im sure that they will) Some ships cature points quicker than others. So finding the right balance for your play still shouldn't be too hard.Now, In these five sectors of the map;There are ""mines"" to capture in the two lanes of alpha and beta sectors, which in turn will add ""resources "" for your team. These resources  will compile, and add the ability to upgrade your ships damage/defence/mobility/and capture rate. The more resources a team has, the more upgrades to the teams ships. (So capture those points!!)There are four main points of capture, in alpha and beta secors.(On each side of the map) With three mines in both sectors. One large ""Gas Plant"" in the very middle. It is ""Gamma"" Sector. (But on the map, it is C, not G..bugs me..lol)The gas plant does not come online untill 10 min of the match has past. And two main bases at the very top and bottom.I'll be honest, I don't know if it's possible to win by resources, or points. But, I do know that capture the enemies base will win the match.UI: Can be a pain a little. But seeing how ""new"" this is, I did expect worse. It isnt that it is placed in a wrong spot. But, for instance; When fighting, my abilites are on the numbers 1-7(I think..lol could be 8) Anyway, I want to keep flying, to make myself a harder target, and trying to do that, aim and shoot, then hit an ability without letting off the throttle, can be a pain..lol (To be fair, I cant think of it being much different. Untill we can set buttons to what we want.)There is very little else I can say, as there isn't much in it at the moment.But, if you like sci-fi, and space shooters. Then, this one is going to be good when finished. And, if you like to ""alpha test"", then you should go ahead and spend the 10. Either way, you can get 10$ worth of fun out of it, in its alpha state. In my oppinion, of couse.[EDIT] I have reinstalled this again..SO much better! I might be willing to throw a few more dollars at it now..:)"

Kirk keeps giving suggestions to the new Captain about how to rescue the stranded vessels, but major components won't be installed until Tuesday......this is a lot like that. Still, I've enjoyed the game enough I thought I should write a short review of what you can expect so far.The combat is great! Each ship varies in its armament, capabilities and how it's most effective. You can hop in a quick and agile frigate and dart in between asteroids and make quick hit runs against a slow moving Flagship or man a giant rail gun and smash ships all the way across the map. There is enough variety between the ships, that each offers its own experience.Remember the 2009 Star Trek? When the Enterprise first encounters the mining vessel and♥♥♥♥♥♥really goes down? Phasers and torpedoes flying everywhere, pieces of hull flying off into space. That's what this game feels like. When you execute your strategy perfectly and unleash hell on your enemy, chewing away a good portion of his hull....Sweet Baby Jesus it's awesome.The game play is great. I've not played DOTA, but I understand it's similar in objectives. There are a few key points you should try to cap, with the ultimate objective being the capture of your enemy's gate that leads to their home base. It's set up in a way that forces you to think tactically and you'll have to work as a team to push in strategic areas. As you collects key resource points, your ships get stronger and stronger, as they tier up.Of course, there is a lot missing, but that comes with the territory of an Early Access game."

First off in general i felt it  was too fast, from combat itself to the speed and destruction of the larger capital ships. And second the larger capital ship seemed really undergunned for such a large ship. Frigates, corvettes, and destroyer style ships should be quick and manueverable with limited options for weapons sacrificing heavy weapons and armor for manueverability and speed. Where as the larger cruiser, battleship, and carrier options should be much harder to kill and have an assortment of heavy weaponry at the severe cost to speed and manueverability. Of course i only played about an hour, so i may be missing some of what the game has to offer, this is just first impressions."
,Recommended,310380,13032894,"Posted: 21 November, 2014",all,Falnore,"Let me start off by saying that this game needs a LOT of polish.  Let me also say that it is currently day two of alpha early access, and we've already seen SUBSTANTIAL polish with a patch.I first heard about Fractured Space by watching a video on Youtube from The Mighty Jingles.  If you haven't already seen it, it's definitely worth a watch.  The dev team behind this game is a hard working machine.  I've been a part of several different alpha tests/early accesses, and I've never seen a dev team put together a patch on day two.  To drive my point home, the newest expansion for Warcraft just dropped, and they're STILL having problems, and Blizzard has an almost infinite number of resources throw at its problems.All of that being said, if you're a fan of DOTA-types or World of Tanks/War Thunder, then this game will be a definite download.However...There are still currently a lot of bugs.  A LOT OF THEM.  I have been playing off-and-on since official early access release last night, and I've only been able to fully complete one match.  This is the nature of the beast when signing on not only to any early access game, but especially one that is this young.  I knew it was going to be like this going in, so please don't take this as a complaint.  The game is MAGNIFICENT.  The gameplay is fantastic, and tactics and patience are well rewarded.So, should you buy into the early access?  Only if you want to support the dev team as they continue development.  If you are easily frustrated by constant game crashes and unbalanced powersets, then please wait until the game has been developed further.  Also, if you just want to pay to be able to play the game early, you should probably rethink your decision.  I would, at this time, only recommend this game to people who genuinely enjoy testing games in early alpha and having their voices heard by the dev team in order to enhance further development."

Of course its a whole lot more fun than I just made it sound. Starting out with the Assassin, I was happy the ship played more or less as its name implies; cloak and ambushing.To describe one of the few rounds I played, I jumped to a nearby area in conflict. Near the opposite end on their side, they had a sniper picking at us from afar. I started to flank, weaving in and out of the asteroids while trying to maintain my cloak until I snuck up on the occupied sniper, point jumped to him while cloaked, lasered him with the ambush skill, and unleashed havoc on him. Up to this point, allied ships were able to break through the enemy and we continued to assault their base.Overall, I'd recommend supporting these devs, they're doing some great work and I hope to see more."

,Recommended,310380,13033757,"Posted: 21 November, 2014",all,King Deer-Bird,"PSA ABOUT P2W: I have seen many people complain about how p2w the game is in the reviews here but this is simply not true, this game follows the world of tanks model but is even better than it. First off the ships you get when you go up the tiers are not all around better than others, just more specialized. I see people complaining about how you can buy overpowered ships but in realty only 2 actually exists that you can, and they would be premium tanks going by the world of tanks analogy. here; however, they are exact copies of normal ships off of the main tech tree except they are        un-upgradeable, and if a noob tries to play them they fail, hard. you can also buy normal ships with platinum (gold/money bought currency etc) however you have to unlock them with xp just like everything else and as the experience is locked in a tech tree you normally have the money you want to buy them far before you have the xp.I have seen some people talk about how the grind is only bearable if you use money but this Is completely false, you can buy boosts with platinum that when applied after a game will increase what you got in the game, but it still relies on what your skill is and the base rewards. these are also single use, unlike world of tanks premium time.You can also get purely cosmetic skins with it.why I say it is less so than wot is you cannot make ""free xp"" with it, as anyone who plays it would know. now on to the review (this was written after I finished)While some of the ships are designed to defeat others as well as long respawn times and no changing class, it makes it kind of annoying when playing but other than that it is a fantastic game.EDIT: wow its been a long time since I first made this, time for some more detail.Fractured space is very fun, while the matches last a long time its gameplay is superb leading towards very fun encounters. There are issues with this game that seem almost impossible for the devs to fix, however. their option to lock the ships into what you originally pick is still a problem, but less so as there are a great deal of them now so the counters that I spoke of in the first review do not really stick as hard. however there are new problems as you cannot connect to a game in progress if someone else disconnects which causes a lot of unbalanced gameplay, framerate is also a problem with your game freezing for a few seconds every minute or so in some lobbies.The balance in the game also needs a lot of work, you will have those people yell that everything is perfectly balanced and you just don't know how to use it correctly (which is disproven by the fact that 1. the devs aren't gods and 2. every time there is a balance patch it proves that they weren't balanced before.) and the ones who go full retard that say teamwork beats any op ship ignoring the fact that two balanced teams playerwise would be affected. In reality due to the massive update awhile ago balance isn't close to perfect, with some ships suffering immensely as they rely entirely on missiles for damaged that are blocked 100% of the time when someone activates point defense, which can now be on practically forever until you run out of energy which has never even gotten close to happening to me. others such as the protector can completely heal ships much faster than multiple people can put out damage. this may not seem like a big deal at the start as healers are a common theme in these games but due to the fact that they're healing ability is massive and they have a shield that absorbs almost all damage, they are impossible to deal with unless multiple people all attack at once, and if the enemy ships are even semi competent, because you are going after the support they will rip you to shreds. combine this with the fact you cannot change classes and no one can come in once it starts and you have a huge disadvantage if one team has one and the other does not, and while not having a medic should be a bad thing, when there are only a few people every bit of unlockable xp is precious it makes it much more difficult than it should be.Im sure you have heard this from every review and that is the grind. due to the problems with the number of ships the majority are locked behind a number of games that while they would be quick for most games suffer due to the time of the match, this leads to playing the same ships over and over until you can get ones that you like, however unlike what most say this is not a huge pain as the starter ships are very well rounded and teach you the game.

I have been here since there were 6 ships (on a side note please change the name of the ""ghost"" back to assassin devs, I mean I can understand changing things generic as flagship and sniper but assassin sounds so much better) and what kept me hooked this entire time was this game is fun as hell, from the unique experience of the objectives and jumping, to the intense feeling behind the fights and the thrill of out maneuvering an enemy, this game kicks♥♥♥♥♥ the issues I said above are problems and do take away, but not nearly enough to make me regret buying this and the fun I have had, sure it has problems and due to the nature of the game they are difficult to fix, but seeing how far this game has come I am confident that they will find a way through them, and make it even better."

You can't change class during a battle, and respawns will see you sitting on the benches for a minute or more. The biggest holes though are in the gameplay; backdooring is far too easy, it being possible to storm and then capture the enemy base before they can even warp back to give any fight. That's fine in an organised match, but in pub games it's a deal breaker. I hope Edge Case doesn't fall into the trap of thinking that doesn't matter. This should all change though with some jump option tweaking and once base AI defences are working.The magic is there.

Der Anfang wirkt chaotisch und unfair. Das liegt mehr oder minder daran, dass die meisten Schiffe spezielle Rollen erfüllen. Fast noch spezieller als in jedem anderen MOBA. Beginnt man mit dem Spiel, denkt man anfangs von seiner Brücke aus, später fängt man (wenn man die anderen Schiffe kennenlernt) an im Teamrahmen zu denken. Dann wird es richtig interessant, aber streckenweise auch etwas frustrierend (wenn das eigene Teamplay nicht so wirklich funktionieren will).Für Solospieler und lonely wolves ist das Spiel nicht geeignet. Für Casualplayer die ihr eigenes Killbedürfnis auch mal hinter Teaminteressen zurückstellen können schon eher.Spielst du mit Freunden? Umso besser! Da es noch keine Ingamevoice-Möglichkeit gibt, bleibt nur der 90iger-Jahre Chat. Das ist definitv nicht zeitgemäß, aber sofern ich die Devs richtig einschätze - und ich habe das Spiel schon eine ganze Ecke - wird das auch noch kommen. Dann eben Curse, oder TS oder wie sie nicht alle heißen :)Fractured Space hat eine steile Lernkurve, sofern man denn will. Auch ist es eines von wenigen Spielen heutzutage, bei dem es Sinn macht Guides und Tipps von erfahrenen Spielern zu lesen. Es ist ein kleines Microuniversum. Genauso wie Schach. Nur eben bunter und bombastischer.Grafik wird durch die aktuelle Unreal Engine auf die Monitore gezaubert. Auch wenn ich kein Fan der UE4 mit ihrem fürchterlichen AntiAliasing bin, so knallt und explodiert es überall ziemlich farbenfroh. Da gibt es kaum etwas zu beanstanden.Der Sound ist ein eigenes Kaliber. Jede Waffe, jede Fähigkeit, jede Tätigkeit hat ihren eigenen einzigartigen Sound und erhöht deutlich die Athmospähre. Es besteht für mich kein Zweifel, dass (wenn die Spieler so wollen) FS ein ordentliches Zeichen im E-Sport setzen kann.Thema Pay2Win:Sofern man Echtgeldkäufe für Schiffe (die nicht besser oder schlechter sind als die Starterships), die man problemlos (4-6 Spiele für die ersten) auch für Ingamewährung kaufen kann als p2w bezeichnen möchte, dann ist es das. Einen Vorteil erhält man dadurch nicht. Fractured Space lebt vor allem von der richtigen Einschätzung der Situation. Wer meint ein teures Schiff kaufen zu können und damit newbs wegzubocken, findet sich schneller auf dem Respawnscreen wieder als einem lieb sein mag.ES GIBT KEIN P2W in Fractured Space.TL:DRDownloaden und ein paar Tage spielen. Nicht von der steilen Lernkurve abschrecken lassen. Es lohnt sich! So etwas gibt es nämlich nicht noch einmal."

The ships feel suitably massive and take time to turn. This adds a tactical element, using asteroids for cover as you try to blind-side the enemy. I really like the three dimensional aspect of this: feels like I'm battling Khan, hiding in the nebula.The ships feel imposing and as their arsenal rains down fiery death from all angles, it gives a satisfying feeling of might.There's an extensive range of ships to choose from, each with their own playstyle. They all capture the feeling of being in charge of a large capital ship, rather than a zippy fighter. There is, however, some variation in speed and agility: you can expect larger ships to be slower but heavier armored and more nimble craft to be weaker. There are no fighter craft to control; some ships launch waves of fighters or bombers but you don't control these directly.The specialised abilities of the various ships (stealth, recon, close combat etc.) in game require team based game play in order to succeed: the focus is on multi player with the only single player play available being the tutorial. Personally, I'd like to see either a story mode or more bot based play in order to further explore the game before facing down live players.Fractured Space is a new take on a team based shooter: the slower pace and larger scale lends itself to a more strategic and thoughtful play style, like home world but with direct control over your units."

They all have their prefered way of playing so once you are in you will find the ships that suit your playstyle.The bad:*Pricing feels high on the micro transaction they are boarderline macro in my opinion and this is not a problem unique to this game.*Lacks a quick communicate option like a command tree where you can with 2-3 button presses ask for support, order an attack etc etc etc. Such a system would be helpful in public matches and specially give new players and idea of what to do.*Bit more feedback on what just nuked you would be nice, sometimes you can really go from being just fine to death in seconds a bit of a what happened would be ideaal to help you learn, again quality of life.The ugly:*Match making is unsure of itself it feels, 1 match is very quick and the next one just will not show up. This makes it quite annoying to play because there is also no indication of why things take longer.

People need to hold and push down (space)lanes acordingly, capture resource points to then acuire upgrades for their ships.

Shame the only people I come across seem to be incapable of understanding this. Bunch up and rush down one lane seems to be the only play most seem to know. If both blobs pick oposite lanes, whoever reaches the end base first wins only after doing this twice. If both blobs meet they fight, the blobs will then reform and repeat. The most excruciating part though, is waiting for a game.I recomend this though, in the hopes that one day enough tacticly minded people will play this beautiful game and I'll start having some really good edge of the command seat capital battles."

Like the Collosus, it's a tank with several damage skills but moves super slow, it's good for taking all the damage and breaking through, or the Sniper, which I don't need to explain anything else, low health, long range, high damage.Graphics 8/10: Everything is just beautiful, you can either play it to see a lot of graphics and particle effects or you can play it with low resolution for a not-so-good computer.In short words: If you like epic space battles, buy the game, if you expect other stuff on gameplay, then look for another game or wait for it."

Though the current 5v5 is alright it would be cool to see more players per a match to get real fleet vs fleet combat going. The action of deep space combat is really brought to life in this game where the capital ships actually have weight behind them, either your crusing down the center of a lane in a flagship, or darting around the astroids in a frigate all of it feels very realistic.

Definately recommend this game to anyone who likes space.I do think there needs to be some changes to HP for some ships, especially the cloaked ships and sniper.  A ship that has devestating alpha, can cloak, has decent speed, and 2000 more base HP than the fast ships that would be hunting them seems slightly unbalanced to me.  Don't get me wrong, I love playing them but they are just don't have enough weaknesses for the role they are filling.Sniper ship also needs less HP and its guns should have slower movement(not too much slower but a sniper shouldnt be able to follow a frigate 5km away(and to the side) and hit every time.  Think a tank destroyer in world of tanks vs a fast medium or light.  They can hit but it's much harder.I think the Carrier damage rating should be reduced 1 point as well.  It really is more of a support/defensive ship and even in close range with max upgrades(vs a max upgrade opponent) it doesnt seem to match the offensive output indicated by its rating.  Just to be clear, I think the damage is fine(but I wouldn't complain if there were a few more bombers per wing) but that it doesn't seem to meet the current offensive rating from what I've found.These current specs are not game breaking by any means and pilot skill usually always wins but I do feel these are relatively easy fixes that would help game balance."

I actually disagree. Each category of ship has a very distinct feel and great strategic potential. The problem is that most people playing this game right now are just like you - intrigued gamers just trying it out a bit. Because of this, no one's coordinating and no one's really trying to win.

Unlike other games, you can't buy one ship and overpower everyone by just buying the most expensive ship. They all have their strengths and weaknesses, and your play style must adapt to what ship you have and what situation you are in.They all have distinctive weapons, sounds, looks, and abilities.There's no many good space combat games out there, so I believe it would be safe to say that this is the best in it's category.Now, that's not to say that it's absolutely perfect.While they have had patches and updates, the matchmaking is flawed. Because of the slim amount of players, they can't quite match everyone up by rank. This somtimes ends up pitting newer players into more skilled people. Another issue from the lack of players is that it can be a pain to find a match, god forbid its late at night.But if you're looking for a space combat game that isnt pay to win, has good graphics and gameplay, this is the game  you want. It's a bit of a learning curve to get used to having to position and maneuver your ship to keep your armor between you and the other ship as well as your guns, but once you get past that and learn how the enemy ships work, this game can be a blast.Out of all the games i've played, i'd have to recommend this the strongest."

Now I'm not going to beat about the bush here, but if you, like me, have never played a MOBA before, then there is a bit of a learning process.  However, I urge you strongly to stick with this one, because it's better than a Sunday roast and at free to play, significantly cheaper.There's spaceships, and then there's Fractured Space spaceships.  It's like comparing a one man kayak to a supertanker, but take that supertanker and load it with a multitude of weaponry and cunning utility features such as ""Chrono Blink"", and you have a fearsome weapon of war.  Then take said behemoth of a spaceship and throw it into a multi-route arena with 9 other behemoth spaceships with the aim of the game being to smash the oppositions base.  If you happen to take down a Leviathan or two en route to victory, then all the better.A balanced team can make a big difference in this game, you need to be aiming for meat, veg and roast potatoes, rather than beans, beans and more beans.  All out sniper teams will not win.  Period.  The next essential ingredient is teamwork, a team that communicates strongly will fare better than a team of skillful lone wolves.  And then you need to understand not only your ship, but every other ship type that you may encounter.  Fractured Space is very much of a rock, paper, scissors mechanic, and understanding which ships you are strong against vs. those that you should tuck your tail between your legs and run, is a key element.Fractured Space initially seems a bit basic and daunting all at the same time, my early multiplayer games resulted in me demonstrating an unhealthy skill in respawning and failing to deal with ship classes that I should by all rights, be able to pummel into bean soup.  Was it due to the fact that they had paid hard cash to get better ships than me?  No.  Fractured Space offers premium ships and skins, but the upgrade is purely aesthetic.  It was simply a lack of understanding on my part of what goes into making a good roast dinner that was my downfall.  After several hours at learning a ship, I suddenly found that I was calling out tactics to my teammates, knowing when to push and when to warp back to base, heal up and defend.The community on the large is very friendly and willing to help, if you don't know how to do something, someone, whether it be in game, or on the forums, will point you in the right direction.  My suggestion to new players is to run the tutorial missions, play a few games against the AI, and then when you do go into a multiplayer game, stick with your teammates and watch out for the call-outs, but beyond everything, have fun.See you on the battlefield, you bring the meat, I'll dish the roasties."

I have bought 3 copies of the game, one Vanguard for myself and 2 Forerunner packs for friends. I've been a living, breathing advertisement for Fractured space and so far everyone I have recommended it to have agreed with me. Fractured Space is addicting.Gameplay - 9/10I want to give the gameplay 10/10 but I feel like some of the cooldowns are a little long when compared to others. For example the Phantom Ghost (And by extension the Ghost) has such a long cooldown on it's primary missles, which means after Ambush -> Missles you have to wait much longer than everyone else to start firing again. There are of course a few minor issues with balance with some ships but as for an Alpha game the game is amazing.The gameplay revolves around huge Space Battleships BLOWING EACH OTHER UP. What's not to like?Graphics - n/aI will give it n/a because there isn't many textures in the game. There are the asteroids, ships, mining/base ships and an endless expanse of space. Yeah. Exactly. With what we have, the graphics are great so there is no problem but I can't really review it.Matchmaking - 8/10I like the matchmaking, not sure why there is an MMR system with no ranks but oh well. The queues can take a while and I can't seem to stop the queue if I want to invite someone or search for Frontline/Conquest instead of vice versa. The games seem balanced usually but there needs to be a penalty for Disconnecting. In too many games does someone disconnect and there is only a 30% faster respawn time. We should get a damage buff for the loss of manpower too. If not then at least add a bot. It's better than nothing.Progression - 8/10The progression seems rather slow. I can't seem to discern how your performance changes your exp/credits earned because it seems about the same whether you win or lose (the only difference being you earn massively less when you lose). Then the exp for each faction takes forever to earn. I know you don't want people running around in the best ships right off the bat but it feels like I have been grinding for ages to earn my Watchmann.Overall score 9/10I REALLY want to give the game 11/9 but with the few problems that I mentioned above (as well as some FPS issues and PING which doesn't make sense. I get 200ping on London servers and 100ping on further away servers. I don't understand myself) however the game is a definite must buy. If they add a campaign it would only make the game better but I feel like they are going to go the Counter Strike route and not add a story, and just focus on the ships and gameplay which is already pretty polished. I've seen games in beta run less smooth.."

,Recommended,310380,25694679,"Posted: 25 September, 2016",all,Setsuna,"Fractured Space is a game of giant spaceships, stately and graceful motion, and ruthlessly low TTKs coupled with strategic and defensive play that can go on for 30m or more. It's a remarkable example of how you can take the MOBA archetype as a starting point and end up at something that not only looks totally different and plays totally different, but actuallybuildson the good parts of the genre.Many reviews for this game go into the strategic depth (they're right), the tactical depth (they're right) or the mechanical level of complexity (they're mostly right). The game plays well, for the most part, and can easily support thousands of hours of play. But I won't say much more on that.I would like to point out the community management for Fractured Space istop notch. The community managers know that having a CoC and banning people based of it will draw a lot of fire on Steam from trolls. But they've stuck to their guns. I have never seen CM's more proactive on banning racists, transphobes, homophobes and even misogynists! It's incredible, and you have to know it comes at the cost of a lot of ill will from troll collectives of Steam.Even the game devs can get punished for bad behavior. While it's rare to see them cross the line, it has happened and the CMs have not handed out special treatment.They do this while still being tolerant of the normal outbursts and rigorous debate we all expect in competitive gaming communities. You can disagree with a dev and call them out on it, even in game or on the forums, and they will listen. They may not AGREE with you or ACT on what you say, but for such a well-policed community the actual level of debate is ""very spirited.""That's something special and rare all on its own, and ECG deserves a lot of credit for this. It's a real accomplishment all on its own.Finally, Fractured Space's deep gameplay is not marred by monetization mechanics. In general, ECG knows that people want to unlock their content and they collect money for cosmetic modifications and ""boosters"" (much like any f2p game). But there is no mechanical advantage afforded as of 09/2016 from any store option. It's a fair game, with a lot of depth. You can play it knowing that while enemies may be better than you, or more coordinated than you, they still have the same tools in their toolkit as you do.And they have stuck to their guns on that stance even though it has caused a lot of short-term problems for them."

Matchmaking now takes significantly less time to find a round thanks to a slowly but noticably expanding player base.  New and awesome ships are being added on a very regular basis by the devs (every month or so).  Visuals are even more beautiful and powerful than before.  A lot of recent reviews are ripping on the new crew drop system, but it's really not that bad.  It's just heavily focused on grinding.  But the devs are active and listening, so I would not be surprised if we see suble tweaks to this system in the coming months.  I would like to also comment on a complaint I've heard a lot:  No, this game is NOT pay-to-win!  Lots of people are complaining that the 'platinum' currency is pay-to-win, but all it's used for is exclusive ship skins that ONLY change aesthetics.  Now that this game has entered free-to-play, you can pick it up and eventually own every ship and weapon available without spending a dime -- though you, myself, and most others, have a significant grind to look forward to before such a goal can be achieved.  Challenge accepted!  Now go play Fractured Space!- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Original review below:Only had the chance to play one round so far but from what I can tell I'm really going to like this game.  There is definitely an initial learning curve, since I didn't get a single kill in that round...and my team lost...terribly, but that was the most fun I've ever had losing!  The ship textures are beautiful!  The weapons are tacticle, diverse, and just awesome!  I'd definitely recommend watching some youtube tutorials before jumping straight into a game, otherwise you might be a bit lost, as there is no starting tutorial at this time (though devs say they're working on it).  My only complaint is some pretty severe, albeit intermittent, lag spikes.  I have a network meter on my 2nd monitor and when my ship would freeze, I'd see the network connection tank.  Would last about 5-10 seconds, then when it regained connection my ship would snap across the map to where it had aparently been going.  Died a couple times because of that.  (Not a problem with my network btw.  It handles all other online games including BF4 flawlessly).  I'm hoping that sorts itself out through development (or that I was just playing on a bad server).  All in all, this is a REALLY fun game.  The sort of game I've been looking for for a long time.  It's like battleships meets league of legends meets starwars.  I'm really excited to see how this game progresses as the devs work on it.  I would definitely recommend it!"

At its core, it's a lane-based capital ship MOBA, with a combination of great graphics and interesting ships. Each ship is very different in how it plays, and (right now) it doesn't take much work to get a new one. The devs add new ships with every update, along with other features, helping keep the game fresh.Coming from Counterstrike, I was impressed at the amount of teamplay already necessary to win, even if everyone only uses the text chat. Teamwork makes the difference between victory and defeat, and as the community is pretty small still, you will often run into the same players multiple times in a playsession.As an alpha, the gameplay is very well done, but other parts of the overall experience are lacking. It is difficult to play with a group of friends, as there is no party or matchmaking (yet), and the main menu buttons are sometimes clunky. This is certainly made up for by the quality of the gameplay, which is the most important aspect of a game anyways.Overall, Fractured Space is a game I would suggest to people who enjoy MOBAs or space sims, but it's a good enough game anyone can try it out."

I would pay $60 to buy this game, but I will not feed a ""pay to win"" scandel.In addition to the above problem, getting credits in game is incredibly grindy. A player may get 15,000 credits from a match, but it takes upwards form 300,000 to buy a ship. Combine that with the 5+ minute que time, and the player is looking at a wasted day.I personally have had one last issue with this game. I do not know if this happend to any other players, but I had all my ships reset a long time ago, Shortly after they added the black widow I believe. I had owned all of the ships currently in the game and then, I had to grind all the credits to buy new ones. It was dissapointing to say the least."

When I got into a match I learned it was fun, very, very fun. Because it is a 3D map and you can ravel up and down you will find yourself getting ambushed from above and then doing the youself. The ships look amazing and some of there abilitys look epic. There are some ships witch are just point and click but the ones that requir more thinking of what you are going to do and some expirience will realy turn the tide of battle. The tech tree and reaserching isn't implemented yet so everything is instantly unlocked but that doesn't won't realy play a role in gameplay because no one weapon is any better than another.Pros- Very fun, many kinds of capital ships to fly, and gameplay never gets old.-Easy to learn, you may feel like a noob at first but you will et the hang of it.-Well ballanced, No one ship can single handedly win a battle.-Well optimized, I don't often have lag even on my slower laptop.-Wonderfull graphics, the ships are very detailed and you know they put in a lo of effort.Cons- Small commmuntiy, at the moment there will only be a few servers with people on them and you will find youself with the same people game after game.-Same map, there is currently only one map to play on and I hope they ad more.Overall this game 9/10, I realy recomend it."

There is alot to love about this game.But it does have one big problem: it is a Pay-or-Grind, and all changes to the game, all nerfs and buffs, every new feature, OOZES of ""Pay"". If only I could buy it once and be allowed to enjoy it like it should.You start off with 3 basic ships, one of each company. Hopefully you will like at least 2 of them, since in order to unlock new ships, you must play enough games by earning Company-XP, and generic Credits. And it can take a loooong time to get a ship you might like: 30 hours of gameplay got me 3 new ships using up to 4 starting boosters. Of course, to shorten the time-consumming process, you may purchase more 'boosters', one for XP, another for Credits. Since the last patch, XP and Credits are now gained at the same relative rate. So if you buy a booster, might as well buy the other. And again, these are not cheap.If only this game could be purchased, a one-package deal as Smite does, I would still be playing and having a blast. But I simply cant take it on myself to spend so much time playing games with one ship just to play with a different ship in 10 hours, and repeating the process forever."

,Not Recommended,310380,13222731,"Posted: 3 December, 2014",all,IMPLeroyJenkins,"***WILL UPDATE SOON***Be aware, regardless of how this game is advertised - IT IS A MOBA. It has potential, but they need to do a few balance passes, fine-tune the system for upgrading your ship during a match (it's really vague at the moment, and automatic - you don't choose a specific upgrade it jsut slightly boosts everything), and tweak the capture mechanics.My initial feelings after lmy first few games are these:1. Nobody plays this. I sat in a lobby for over 10 minutes at one point and saw at most three other players.  They need a queue system as opposed to the current lobby system which allows for uneven teams. The games I DID manage to play felt pretty empty since the map encompasses about 10 times the volume it needs to. That being said, celestial objects and the stations are very detailed and fun to look at.2. Balance is nonexistent. If you're not in a Flagship or a Sniper, you're kinda useless. Flagships are supposed to be tanks, but they have just as much firepower as the attack vessels, with the exception of the sniper. The problem is that flagships have around 30-50% more health than other ships while dealing a comparable amount of damage. The Sniper is fairly balanced, although as opposed to nerfing accuracy while rotating the main cannon, cut the rate of fire to about 40% of its present state. It's squishy as hell and pretty slow, which is fine.3. Capture mechanics are kinda stupid. Basically it uses a slightly modified version of Battlefield's Domination point capture mechanic where each ship has a different capture rate (not the best idea IMO).They say in the tutorials that you can't just sneak into the enemy base right away, but my team got backdoored by a lone flaghsip suiciding in our home base twice. This was after about fifteen minutes, and it was really kinda disapponiting. You shouldn't be able to warp into the enemy's home base unless you've captured either Alpha or Beta sector in its entirety.4. The ""skill system"" is a bit of a misnomer. You have a skill bar with 1-7...but there are some pretty major problems with this. Firstly is that three of these abilities are common to every vessel. Pressing [2] fires missiles at your current target if you're in range, holding [4] brings up the jump menu to move around the map, and [5] will warp you to your home base.[1] and [3] are your two unique active abilities, and then they stuck LMB and RMB in the middle of this for your primary and secondary weapons (which are unique to each ship, but aren't always weapons - sometimes it's a mark to increase damage or a scout drone to reveal enemies).5. Only your [2] (missile volley) and sometimes your [3] home in on their targets. Everything else is drected via your mouse, but what they don't explain at any point during the tutorials is that every ship's weapons have different tracking speeds (the rate at which they rotate). Your targeting reticle is comprised of laser pointers emanating from the barrel of each weapon on your ship (on ships that actually have cannons), a circle that denotes the current direction your turrets are aiming (follows the mouse), and a small x that denotes the center of the screen. Movement is clunky and slow (granted, you're flying ""capital"" ships so that's to be expected), but all ships move quickly enough that if you're moving and firing at a moving target, your turrets probably can't track them.All in all, I enjoy this game aesthetically but the lack of balance and blatant gap in some mechanics (namely the base capture mechanics) leave much to be desired. Also the chat has cut out on me midgame.11/10 would get backdoored again."

Very pretty, solid fundamentals, great ship design. I can't recommend it yet though- it's an alpha and it shows. In my first hour of play I had two crashes, one of which rebooted my PC. The game runs poorly and suffers a lack of players (right now 100 are online of which maybe ~10 are in an open game) and features. If it was just an open beta  I would recommend without reservations but, since they're charging, I'd say stay away unless the game sounds REALLY appealing. Check back in a few months."

With no way to see server ping before joining i couldnt find one suitable to my specific area (""U.S. east"" is not helpful at all). Made hitting anything a guessing game.-The play area is tiny. For being a game with apparently infinite amounts of space, the actually space used by players (including snipers) wasnt very much, making mid-range ships that much more effective.-As a level 6 sniper i was taking twice as much damage from a level 7 sniper even as he was under fire from another ship. There are clear balancing issues that need to be addressed.-There is some system by which parts of your ship become damaged and either retreating or turning your ship becomes necessary, but how this works and in what way is beyond me. There is no explination in-game.-The crew members ramblings became a burden and i quickly jettisoned them.-Their bodies did NOT slow the enemy.-half the abilites seemed to do nothing. In cases where i used a weapon and it did little to no damage, maybe a message explaining the effective range of the weapon is in order?-You cant change your ship mid-game. So once you get into a game and realize the ship you picked is a floating crap-pile, you are stuck with it the entire game. Have fun being a burden to the rest of your team.-hate to bring this up but THERE IS NO AIR IN SPACE. having the ships slow to a stop once i cease using thrusters is not realistic nor fun. Too many space games do this and i find it annoying even if they have a plot device for it. (at least have it as an option you can deactivate or a ""full stop"" button you can key bind)-warping is a mess. you can WARP! (yay!) but only to this square foot or this square foot. (boo!) (you are forced to warp into a specific area, meaning enemies know where to look to ambush you.) you are also locked out of certain destinations if you dont own the arrival base, making coming up behind your enemy impossible.Things to improve:-The large shields attached to the A1/A2/B1/B2 stations should be destructable. In fact, everything should have HP and could potentially be destroyed given enough firepower.-allow free ship movement. having ""up"" as always ""up"" isnt what space is about and limits the creativity of the player.-put rams on the damn ships already. i want to penetrate things.-maybe a mode by which multiple players control one ship (pilot, gunner, etc.)-at least a couple of the weapons didnt have a form of targeting. for a game set really far in the future, i find it silly that anyone would go into combat with ""fire and forget"" weapons willingly.-fix warping. maybe make a ship type (scout?) that can warp anywhere? or just remove the current limitations.-give the smaller bases some kind of defenses, even if its basic guns. its too easy to flood a side.-limit the number of each ship type per team until the balancing issues are addressed-increase overall ship shields by 20-40% until connection issues are fixed. the buffer will help players survive those nasty lag spikes.tl;dr: skip it and revisit once its release."

It's just sad.________________________________________________I cannot recommend this game any more.Originally ECG were intending to develope a strategic MOBA in space in which skill mattered. With the phase 2 update they watered it down and now they completely burried that idea with phase 3. Fractured space has become a space shooter.- They shrunk sectors without rebalancing the ships which means ship balance is completely out of the window- They introduced a ""mini game"" by allowing shooting down mining ships to gain resources (this was intended to be a skill based game, remember?) which makes capping mines undesirable. A capped mine produces a lot less resources and it allows the opponent's team to destroy ""your"" mining vessels - so people just sit outside the cap bubble and farm the mining ships that spawn every couple of seconds (which give resources even though they never reached an asteriod! True story!)- Respawn times have been lowered severely which makes takedowns almost pointless. It used to be crucial to not die before gamma, to take out healers first, to position yourself in a way to avoid being shot at. All of that is out of the window. You can die a couple of seconds before gamma and still jump in before it gets capped.- They introduces a LOT of bug. You would think they learned from the desaster that was phase 2 but this really makes you think if they even test their builds at.EGC is trying to cater to the COD audience. I get it, they need to make money and by targetting  a bigger audience more people will stick. But they never got around fixing the glaringly obvious issues that were present from the moment it entered beta (and the core players very very vocal about). Instead they added feature after feature and alienated they core player base more and more.I am convinced that if they had fixed the core problems (which are still not fixed, btw) they'd be just as successfull.If you wanna give this game a try because you think a space shooter might be ""your thing"", at least wait a couple of weeks for them to fix the bugs before giving it a try.Original (positive) Review:______________________________________________I feel compelled to write a review to offest all of the recent negative reviews by people who obviously didn't understand the game.A few points I'd like to adress from these negative reviews:1)""The game is pay2win!!1""It's not. No, really, it isn't! It's pay to unlock - ships unlocked with real world currency are in no way better or worse than any other ship. Higher tier ships are just more specialized, notbetter, even though the way the shipe are arranged in the tech tree might give you that impression. And you can still unlock them with ingame currency.If you got killed by a higher tier ship it's likely because this player is just more experienced. Fractured space is a game that's easy to get into, yet is hard to master.2)""WTF, I payed for that game, now it's F2P?""You didn'tbuythe game. You paid for the priviledge of getting into the game earlier than others. You also paid for exclusive content and a lifetime boost to XP and credits after every match. You also supported the developers so they were able to even reached this point.And yes, the game is free to play now - as wasalways intendedand communicated by the devs in douzens of different places. Yes, even thesteam storestated that from day one! You just didn't read - not the games fault. Now suck it up, get in your ship and join the queue already!2)""I can't even start the game, what is this garbage?!""This ""garbage"" is an eraly access game inalpha phase. Yes, there are technical problems every now and then. The game was released as f2p to increase player size and get more feedback on things like this. By leaving a negative review you are not helping - just report the issue and come back later to a better game - it's worth it!And to be totally honest here:Yes. The game has issues - it's far from being perfect. There are some issues which are well descibed in other (serious) reviews, even positive ones. But I did mention it's early access, right?Do you rember the line ""has potential"" in the reviews of other early acces games? Fractured space is alreaedy there, despite of it's little problems. It's playable, fun, challenging and engaging even in it's current alpha state.Just give it a serious try. It deserves it."

Performance of this game has been greatly increased and optimizations have removed the lags and clunkiness of the first time I tried it. The visual fidelity has been somewhat lowered but it's worth it since game still looks great and better performance/gameplay is always preferred to make a game more accessible for newcomers. Gameplay wise I this time around enjoyed it a lot more, Ships are faster and more classes of ships etc. Have been introduced. Everything is much more polished and in my opinion so is gameplay. This is a double edged sword however and this game has been losing players due to the fans of the original early access game being used to that gameplay, now felt enraged about the new changes. However I argue that if you are a newcomer and never tried the old gameplay, it will not cause trouble for you. This game has been streamlined to appeal more for the masses while still trying to maintain the tactical skill aspects, albeit making it less so to broaden the appeal. The original early access game was catering to very niche market IMHO. Of hardcore players whose skill in the game would quickly alienate newcomers and the game mechanics just taking too much patience to master. Also the devs have been experimenting quite randomly with ideas and the core game has been almost overhauled so many times that alot of the original community has moved on due to frustration. Again this is not an issue to the newcomers who don't know what revisions of game have been in the past. In the past player numbers were dropped so low it would take 10-15 minutes to get into a match. This has been remedied by devs by introducing bots to fill the gaps caused by fewer people populating servers. Now I can get into a match in about 30 seconds. Of course playing mixed battles with bots and humans is not ideal for this type of game but it is the only solution now in an effort to save this game from dying out while trying to increse player numbers. In my opinion they have succeeded as now the game is not a murder fest of extreme players who were born with this game at hand and are like mutant freaks with superpowers and annihilate every poor newcomer in seconds. I too can now score satisfying kills and help me get engaged in this game more. Like I said, this time I enjoyed it. To the HC gamer this is an abomination because they are allergic to casual gamers who wander to a new game to try it out. They want to stick to their niche and in their uber clans and don't want noobs to rain on their competetive superiority. I understand that HC gamers do need games for themselves where they can feel at the top of the foodchain but also there needs to be accessibility for noobs or the game will die out. If you are a fan of the early access game, this is propably not for you. But if you are a newcomer, this is a fine alternative to dreadnought since the gameplay is completely different and instead of competing with dreadnought, they complement each other in capital ship battle market. We don't have many of those as you know. There are few concerns about the future of this game though, and that is the low player numbers caused by the devs releasing this game in a too unfinished state to begin with. The long dev cycle and many iterations and changes this game has had, has caused many to move on thus leading to decline in player numbers. Like said before, the added bots to fill the loss of human players has smoothed it out a bit and made the game easier to get into. But it's not a perfect solution of course.You can see my original review below if you are interested to compare my experience with this game now.My old review a year ago:Man I really, really want to dig this game, but alas, as it is now, I can't. I got this on early access because I can't wait for Dreadnought to be finished. I'm a sucker for space combat but especially for Capital class combat. Sadly, this is a game that  has wonderful pontential graphically, cool looking ships etc. But fails in my experience utterly to convey a Capital class battle. Your ship, no matter how many miles/kilometers long behemoth your'e riding with, moves slow as a Capital ship but takes hits like a small scout class ship. I mean literally not even like a fighter, but rather a scout. The lifespan of these ships once engaged in battle are less than a minute. Or then I'm just such a bad player in this game which is totally possible. The thing for me is, there's potential in game mechanics, such as turning your ship around to present the enemy with fresh hull plating and shields, but because the ships are so slow, I never lived long enough to use that mechanic effectively. If there was TIME for a player to actually learn to get used to the nuances of gameplay mechanics here, it would make for a lot better experience plus make the battles actually feel like Capital Class ships dueling it out. The other problem I think is the scale of battles. There's no way to hide behind objects or use the aforementioned tactics when 5 other capital ships are missiling and lasering your ship from every angle like a sitting duck. There's simply too many capital class ships allowed in the same map causing mayhem rather than cool and balanced gameplay. Maybe this game needs introduction of bot fighter jets and bombers to balance things out, I don't know but for me the game is insanely poorly balanced at it's current state.The other thing to mention is atmosphere. This is a game that has the elements for great atmosphere, but I found it all lacking in a big way. The game felt like it has no soul to me. I could not care for my crew one bit. And they are not that different balance wise to even take notice. So Capital class whimper battle combined with lots of dying and respawning, having to move all that way back to battle like a sloth only to be executed to pieces upon arrival in 30 seconds, combined with soulles atmosphere killed the experience for me. I'm not a hardcore player but rather a casual one and that's possibly why I could'nt enjoy the game even when I wanted to. However there are games out there that give a sense of rewarding to both n00bs and elitists alike, so it should'nt be impossible to achieve. I hope this game will evolve into a serious contender for Dreadnought. Consider waiting a while before getting into t,his game unless you're a completely fanatic and hardcore player. Perhaps not the best game for people with real lives on the side, takes too much learning to become effective for a total casual gamer like myself. Now that does not mean it's a bad game, just wasn't for me."

The Maps are relatively small and divided into two separate areas of space. In which a ship will have to warp to a destination and attempt to capture the other team’s resources and base. Once a team has direct access them one can warp to the opponent’s base. Teams consist of five vs. five, and have a selection of ships to utilize. Ships are somewhat upgradeable within an upgrade tree and points can be gained to purchase other ships that have different abilities.So far the game play is fun and gameplay seems to be balanced.

A lot has changed, and since you are browsing the reviews, I assume that you have seen that several members of the community dislike the changes. Although I don’t like everything that has changed, I can say that I am actually enjoying the game more than I was before.So what happened since my last review?-Implants added in, allows you to specialize crew for each ship similar to Runes in LoL. You can have up to 5 of a type of implant, and 15 total. They range from base hull strength to utility cooldowns to attack damage, ect... When these first game in, defense implants were incredibly overpowered. Since then, they have been brought down to a more balanced state.-Crew leveling. You can now level crew members up to legendary status, which only really lets you use whatever type of implant you feel like in their slots. (Normally they are tied to attack/defense/utility.) They also get small animations. Used to be the only way to get them was from RNG drop pods.-3 new ships added. All of them were pretty strong at first, then they were brought down balance wise. (The Paragon “carrier” did get a few buffs, if you read my previous review.)-Lots of improvement on the art and optimization side. There is now a “low performance” mode for those of you who don’t have the time or money to build a supercomputer. I don’t have experience using this mode, but apparently it’s helped a lot.-Quite a bit of balancing, bug fixes, and other stuff that I have probably forgotten about.-And last and least according to who you ask, the map changes to Conquest mode:As per usual, the devs introduce radical changes then scale them back. (Like the implant example above) At first, we had significantly reduced lane sizes and respawn durations. These changes have since been partially reverted, but their impact on the game is still there.That being said, I have not had as much fun as I am currently since they reverted some of their previous changes. The matches are faster paced, yet still retain their strategic side from before the changes.Don’t get me wrong, there are still many things that I feel need to be changed and/or improved upon (like the tutorial, which is forced by the way, you have been warned XD), but I actually like where the lane sizes are now.Before I wrap this up, I just wanted to say the tutorial forces you to play a game type called Frontline. Most people play Conquest, so the queue times will probably be longer. Have patience. No, the game is not ""dead"".So in conclusion, did the recent patches change the game? Yes.Is this game now “Call of Duty in space” like some of the reviews say? No.Since the game is free to play, I suggest you try it. Not everyone likes space games, and not everyone likes MOBAs. I happen to really like both.If you have any questions or just want to hang out, feel free to drop into the Official Fractured Space Discord here:https://discord.gg/MZtZCNqHope to see you in game/in Discord,o7Previous Review from September 21st, 2016So I am updating my review after just over a year for the upcoming Phase 1 launch. (Original is below if you are interested)Here’s my attempt at a TL; DNR:Fractured Space is a 5v5 team based space ship MOBA with two game modes. Both require objective control (and coordination) to win. (Conquest is the main mode though) There are currently 31 ships in game, each fitting loosely into tank, dps and support roles. Each ship comes with a primary weapon and 4 other abilities. (EG: Missiles, fighters/drones/bombers, teleports, cloak, shields, heals, ect…) These abilities vary greatly depending on what the ship is designed to do. (EG: a Brawler can use a harpoon torpedo to grab enemies and pull them into its close ranged weaponry.) Ships have 6 sides of armor (front, left, bottom, ect) that reduce damage taken from that direction, and can be broken to remove this damage reduction.Ships can only rotate on a 2d plane (Left and right), but can move in a 3d plane. Some people hate this, but the lack of 3d rotation adds a great deal of importance on positioning and playstyle variation depending on both your target and your ship. (For instance, some ships have powerful frontal weaponry, but are vulnerable to top/bottom/side attacks as a result.)I recommend Fractured Space because:-It’s free to play.-It’s not pay to win. (No, not at all. Everything can be obtained in game for free save for skins.)-It’s actually pretty balanced. (With some ships hard countering others.) As a newer player, you may run into teams filled with cloaking, heavy or even sniping ships, but you will learn how to deal with them eventually if you stick with it. To expand upon this, the starter ships are great at their intended roles if you take the time to learn them! (They are less specialized than their more expensive counterparts.)-It is a deep game with a high skill cap that requires both knowledge of your ship’s capabilities as well as your enemy’s. (It’s good to note the game is generally balanced around mid-high skill level, so some ships will feel underpowered until you learn how to use them.)-It has 31 ships each with separate abilities and unique playstyles. Some ships overlap others, but still play very different from each other thanks to their ability kits. (EG there are 3 sniper ships in the game that play fairly different from each other.)-It can get pretty competitive.-It doesn’t have a skill tree, meaning you can unlock any ship once you have the credits with no exponentially growing “ship tree” like Star Conflict. Additionally, more expensive ships are generally more specialized and harder to play, but not always better depending on the situation. (Good for new players)-It has a neat little crew system. Crew members will give status notifications (Jumping, armor destroyed on x face, ect), enemy spotted notifications, and even taunt players that you kill. You can have a max of 5 crew members, each with slightly varying stats. (And none being outright better than others)-Pretty good graphics.Cons:-I’ve heard some people have trouble running the game on lower end rigs. I don’t have any issues with a 980TI/i7-6700k. (I have crashed 0 times within the last 30 hours of gameplay.) If you have a low end rig, you may not be able to play this game very well even with the graphics turned down.-Heavily skill reliant? Some people may find this frustrating, especially after they win a few games and get put up against more experienced players.-The recently reintroduced Paragon (A heavy carrier ship) feels fairly useless, especially in higher skill games. It’s a polarizing ship that if over buffed could be overpowered, so it is a difficult ship to balance.Neutral/Misc facts:-Pick/Ban phase is currently in the works. Will be nice for higher level play.-Voice Communication is also in the works.-Not too grindy. Just enough playtime required in order to unlock new ships IMO.-Legendary skins for ships provide slightly more credit income, and look pretty cool/have different animations. (These are purchased with real money.)-A basic competitive league.-Some ships have loadouts with slightly varying modules to choose from. These choices aren’t always impactful/meaningful. Newer ships generally don’t have loadouts yet. I’m assuming this will improve with time.-Some PVE, though I haven’t played it since they’ve added it, and as a result cannot review that feature.Conclusion:All in all, as of last week this game is now my most played game on Steam. I have thoroughly enjoyed it thus far, and I am glad that I have been able to watch this game develop over the last year and a half.If you like space games, or you like competitive games, I think you should at least try this game.Edit: Unfortunately, I've run out of characters for my third and original review, but it was also positive."

,Recommended,310380,21536394,"Posted: 28 February, 2016",all,potasium56,My Current Thoughs are its a Great Team Based Game!The things that needs to be patched in conquest mode are the time per rounds a game can litterally be to long espeically if you having a horrible time aka dieing reapeatly or your team sucking. This basically forces players to rage quit before anyone wins or loses. There needs to be a time limit where onces the time is reached the game just automatically calculates which team wins or losses based on resources and ship level or somthing along the lines of that....because where it stands you can basically have an unlimited game  if  no one captues the main station.So imagine having a game where it last 1 plus hours because no one can capture either station...imagine how much rage you build up when you die everytime you see another enemy spaceship and your teaming not doing there job...now how many of you would rage quit once this happends... I can't stand playing a match for 1 plus hours and dieing evertime i encounter an enemy or you team not knowing what to do or using team work...When this happends i rage quit the match and rejoin to find better players...Now untill this time issue is fixed in conquest mode.... the work around is finding a team that either have a  voice communitcation program...so you can communicate and straticially plan attacks...because solo queing is like rolling the dice if your going to have a bad team or good team...If you do solo que don't be surprized if you encounter the issue above..Besides that mayjor issue the game its really interesting and excited to see what they do in the future...

Of course, it has many faults, but come on, it's still in early access. Even so the combat is great, the graphics are beautiful, the ships powerful and imposing. It's a game to play with friends, not being able to communicate via voice with your teamates is troublesome sometimes, keeping in mind it's a team based game, where teamwork really is everything. The community is small right now, 360 players is the most I've seen online, so the queues are a bit long, (5 mins tops) but if you're patient you'll have a really good game. The developers still need to implement a better team making system to be able to play with your friends, currently you either make a custom game or are limited to 1 friend in your squad, but as I said, it's still in development, so who knows. It would be good however if they made it an option to play single or coop against AI, in order to be able to train (without xp or credits rewards) without having to wait for so long on queues. Not a wave based combat or anything, just a normal game (point capture) but with AIs.Other than that it's a really enjoyable game, however don't buy it now if you don't like to play games in development as it still has some issues."

I understand this game had a lot of time in early access/Alpha testing, whatever you want to call it, and so there are players out there who know a lot about the gameplay mechanics already.  This has translated into a pretty toxic newbro experience for me.I do realise this is just my experience and that it could well just be bad luck, but I have never entered a game as a new player and had so much grief about my ship choice before the match has even started.  Being told we will lose because I chose X ship out of the few available at the start is the kind of crap that puts people off.  This has happened to me repeatedly over the course of my small number of hours played.It may sound like I have a thin skin, but the fact is this.  I play games to have fun.

Not even ""For an alpha"" or ""Taking into consideration how early it is in development."" It is a hell of a lot of fun for a game, period. Having said that, it IS an alpha. There are some balance issues, missing features, and it is a bit rough around the edges......but it's an alpha....that is the point. Updates are frequent, issues get addressed quickly, and engagement with the community is high. This game is quite clearly going to turn into something very special, and to be able to jump in on the fun now, for under 8 bucks, is an absolute steal.Some meat: The ship types are varied and interesting, with distinct roles, functions, and designs. The designs are bit more realistic than what people are typically used to, so they will look weird at first...but they grow on you. The combat is smooth and the game mechanics are solid. Essentially you fight via 2 side lanes to lock down a jumppoint at the end of the lane that enables you to jump to the enemy base and cap it. Along the way in the lane there are 3 cappable points that give resources, which are used to level up. The third middle ""lane"" is a capturable station that gives your team a buff when capped, but only becomes cappable every so often. Other game modes are being worked on, as are other maps.Combat is insanely fun, wheather you play as a railgun toting Sniper, a cloaking and ambushing Assassin, a floating fortress Flagship, a run and gun Frigate, a bullying Enforcer, or one of the other classes (8 in all, lots more coming). Snipers can see and shoot clear across the lane, but the lane is literred with asteriods that allow ships to approach via cover.....unless they want to cap one of the points, in which case they must skirt across the open for a bit. But while they are doing that, an Assassin is inevitably making his way to the Sniper, using a combination of cloaking and asteriod cover. Some classes have the ability to blink (teleport) , others can speed up cap speeds, others can snare/immobilize enemies, others can heal, others can detect cloacked enemies....to name just a few. It all unfolds with surprisingly good rock-paper-scissor balance....except way more complicated. Each of the 8 classes bring a unique feel and purpose.Anyways, I wanted this to be short, but I see I could not do that. Too many good things to say about this game. In short, if you love space combat, get this game."

I do like the fact that this title is very much a team-oriented game like League of Legends, DOTA, Demigod, etc. but still has the feel of space combat to it."

,Recommended,310380,14247780,"Posted: 30 January, 2015",all,maryisdead,"Basically a slow-paced capture-the-flag with big space ships.Currently there are a few ships to choose from (I think 8 or so), each with its own characteristics and weapons. You can further customize them with different loadouts, changing or rather adjusting abilities and weaponry. More ships seem to be unlockable (through in-game currency?) but that doesn't seem to be implemented right now.It's 5 vs 5 on a map divided into five sectors: Your base, the enemy's base, two side-sectors and a special sector in the middle where a gas mining facility is located. You reach each sector by jumping, making only adjacent sectors available as jump destinations. Initiating a jump makes you very vulnerable and needs a few seconds to complete. Both side-sectors have minor objects to capture and also two larger ones (where you can also repair). The more objects are captured by your team, the more resources you gain. From what I can tell, this helps faster respawning, faster repairs etc. While in-game your ship will be able to level up at certain points (indicated in the upper right corner of the HUD) and you'll either have to get to one of the larger stations or your home base to aquire that upgrade. Basically this means more shield power and that is important as capturing the enemy home base will drain your health a lot. The capture level for both home bases can't be reset or decreased and you'll have to watch out for rogue enemies that might try to (partially) capture your home base while your team is busy counting the stars.The main goal obviously is to capture the enemy's home base. Combat is rather slow-paced as those ships' movement is really ponderous. This makes you think twice before going anywhere; considered movement is a must and you really have to take into account what ship you're maneuvering and how to best use its abilities and weapons. I really like that. Also, going alone is almost always a bad idea. Taking on two enemies at the same time will have you respawning at your base in most cases. But there's always the possibility to flee a lost battle by jumping home or to another sector and try to get repairs.Ship movement and controls seem awkward at first but you'll get the hang of it after having played a few rounds and eventually you're going to like it. You'll feel like a boss when you've spotted an enemy,slide-turnbehind an asteroid to hide, let them pass and then ascend to attack. Capturing the enemy's home base in a suicide run scratching on my last bars of health with my repair drones fixing stuff up and a lot of enemy fire hitting my rear also felt epic.Unfortunately key bindings seem to be fixed right now and I don't quite like them (abilities mapped to 1-5, R and F unmapped in combat). I hope being able to customize them will be implemented later on.What I didn't like on my first impressions is that it seems that the game isn't balanced so well right now. Hitting ships with your weapons isn't so easy as they spread fire quite a bit (most will fire rockets or plasma beams or whatever that is) and then there are some that'll hit you from far away and there's little you can do besides taking cover or leaving the scene. Though I haven't fully explored each ship type and its abilities yet and that might be due to that, inexperience and plain incompetence.Also, besides some tutorial on YouTube you pretty much are on your own to figure out what's going on. Weapons and abilities have no descriptions at the moment and you just have to try everything out.All in all a rather refreshing experience for me and a welcome break from all the hectic twitch shooting that's around everywhere.Finally, considering its current form (already very playable, a few crashes and minor bugs here and there), this makes me think there's still hope in Early Access. Well done and done right.Some tips:When initiating a jump, already start rotating your ship in the direction you want to look at when arriving. The ships turn slow like a dead whale and you don't wanna get shot in your back or side when you get there.When it's clear to you that a fight is lost, try to escape (jump) and get repairs, if necessary. The respawn timer will increase drastically while the game proceeds (up to around one minute) and that way you'll be back in combat far sooner.Pressing O while in-game will give you a help overlay that explains the HUD. I found that useful in the beginning."

Not so much on the maps but I'm sure they will be improved as the game progresses through development.There are quite a few ships you can play as, however they must be unlocked by playing.The map is similar to that of a moba, however not like one you have ever played."

Just like those space battles we loved in Star Wars.Everything about Fractured space makes it clear that this is something special. The UI looks good, but is easy to navigate. The tutorial is very good. The graphics are beautiful, and the gameplay is engaging and challenging. Easy to pick up, and yet hard to master. It's just so polished and yet it's only just gone on beta release!This is a fantastic game and with a responsive and talented team of devs behind it has the potential to become a PC gaming classic.I highly recommend this game. Free to play, and don't pay any attention to the ""bads"" who played for 20 minutes and got wrecked then cry about it in bad reviews.THERE IS NO PAY TO WINTHERE IS NO PAY TO WINTHERE IS NO PAY TO WIN"
,Recommended,310380,26473166,"Posted: 7 November, 2016",all,me hat 'n' me Ghandi,"A great game with an emphasis on teamwork and knowledge of game mechanics.Fractured Space is a a beautiful game, with great visual and sound design. It has a very heavy focus on teamwork, so being polite, cooperating and reading your allies and your enemies behaviour is key. You WILL need to learn and fast. Each ship, similar to hero's in other MOBA and MOBA-esk games, has is strengths, weakness' and purpose. Understanding how to play each ship is key.Most games follow a fairly similar pattern, cap mines, fight for Gamma, attack enemy base. Don't let that fool you though, just because the game has a mould, doesn't mean you have to follow it. Each match will have it's different fights, and in each fight you might have to play slighly differently. And if you emerge victorious from a fight, you do feel a sense of pirde.However, it is not without it's flaws. The first and most important one is balance. With so many ships and so many factors to take into account, the game could be said to be unbalanced, and that wouldn't be wrong. It would however be a very narrow view. As a player with over 500 hours playing spread over around  2 years, I've seen unbalanced in FS, and it's done nothing but improve and the Devs have done nothing but learn (if slowly at times), but the game isn't perfect when it comes to balance, dare I say it will never be perfect, but which game is?The single biggest issue however is the Match Maker, or MM. It uses a system called MMR, which is based on win victories and defeats, to ""balance matches"". Needless to say it's not the best system. It's been endlessly debated, moaned about, changed, tweaked and is a constant work in progress. If I were you, dont get angry about it, others will, but just try to play the game, help others and carry harder.The second is to do with ECG themselves. Having talked to the Devs, I know they are a great bunch of guys and girls that only want to make the game be fun and enjoyable for everyone, they just have a funny way of showing it sometimes. From random experimental patches, suprise launches or lack of communication, ECG definitely have their own way of doing things.Overall, Fractured Space is a great game with fun and varied gameplay, but not always balanced and with a WIP MM. ECG can seem to be a bit random at times, but they mean well."

Besides skins you can also unlock ships outright with money or speed up the unlocking process, but honestly, by doing that you are shooting yourself in the foot. You need to at least try every ship and understand how it works to have a chance at properly countering it, so the process of unlocking ships felt rewarding and meaningful.The only complaint I might have over this game is its poor promotion and advertisement. I can respect that the developers chose to spend the resources on improving the game rather than advertisements, but the game does have a rather small community, so you might be waiting roughly 2 to 3 minutes to get a match, but each match does take roughly 20 minutes to complete, so it’s not that bad.The game is constantly updated, the ships are being balanced, new modes are being added and it all feels fresh whenever I log in.I've heard players complaining that the game crashes, but I've never had it happen to me, so I can't really say much on the matter.Overall, I’d highly recommend this game."

Longest I've had to wait was 2 minutes which isn't bad at all.Short Version:+ve The core of this game is good and fun to play-ve The rewards based drop system aspect of it is seriously lacking* Overall I would recommend the game and I look forward to see how it develops; and that is coming from someone who payed £8 for the game before it became F2P.Longer Version:The game is a sort of mix between a 3rd person aspect space ship combat on a MOBA lane battle map. There are no 'creeps' or capture point defences except at the home base area. You can change ships and crew, of which there are many, depending on your playstyle. Regarding the latter of these unlocks - they won't have an effect on new players because they are so hard to come by (a mistake on the developers part I think).There is a grinding aspect to the unlocks, especially the crew variable. And this is the issue I have with the game: You could play six games taking about 3 hours and unlock a Gold (6games), Silver (4games) and Bronze (2games) set of drops and having nothing useful to show for it (you only get one item per drop). I understand the principal of random drop and the fact you might not always get something you want; but the pencentage proportions are way out and the way they are obtained are also not ideal. Even Mass Effect 3 had a better system of drops than this game - it's just too structured and minimal, something which could have been changed if they increased the amount of items you get each drop. As a new player I definitely felt there was very little outside of the actual ship v ship combat to tinker with, which in a semi-MOBA style lanes game is a mistake. The diversity of ships is there for the MOBA style, the rest is not. Personally I felt the lanes could use AI defencepoints areas prior to the main base as is common with games like DOTA etc.(+)+ Good gameplay with tactical and strategic depth+ Looks GREAT+ Lots of customisation options are there (but see bad drop system)(-)- Grinding mixed with a bad drop system- Lack of different maps / solar backgrounds- No quicker game mode at present (20-30 min games) This is set to change though.- The game really doesn't do much to hook new players"

Game is really screaming for more content, the real beef, not just new ships. At the moment it's way too much grind and the ships and especially crew and prices are way too high compared to basic f2p credit gain through playing. Works best with premade group, as the difference in ship and player quality fluctuates a lot. Bought Armada Pack myself, which gives a lot of variation and playing time with totally different kind of ships. I doubt I would've played it this long without the pack, with just the starter ships. Download it, try it, it's free. If you like the game mechanics, you have option to invest some money or just grind away. Overall enjoyable game with its flaws, but with plenty of potential, worth a try."

Or even better - you wait 10 minutes, then somebody disconnects when game is starting and you need to wait again...- the game system is vulnerable to disconnects.

A quick 3 point capture brawl, which is a pretty quick struggle for resources and leveling and lots of action.  The other mode is a 2 lane tactical fight for domination, with a periodic center point that provides the whole team with an increasing boost every cycle.  It's this last mode that you get the longer battles that strongly benefit from team composition and cohesion.I originally picked this up a year or so back think it was Dreadnoughts, but was delightfully surprised how much better it was after playing the Dreadnought closed beta.I akin the second mode to a MOBA like enviroment, but no creeps, and the pace is a bit more strung out, allowing teams to recover from small mistakes.It's a fantastic game that suffers from a lack of press, and thus a smaller player base.One of my favorite F2Ps around.  Jump on in.  PvBots, Co-Op, and PVP are all options.And the ships are gorgeous.[UPDATE]  5/1/2017I've recently jumped back into this after a hiatus and really found myself enjoying myself.  I'll have to admit I'm a bit perpexed about the mixed reviews.The game has only gotten better overtime, and I say this as a founder who remember when there were just 10 British servers up, and maybe 5 guys playing at any given moment.Cues can be a struggle at times, and it'd be nice to have player count on EACH game mode.  Co-Op and PvP.  PvP queues can take a bit longer but, I've been queueing up with a mate the last few days and they don't take much longer than a typical MOBA ranked match might take.I suppose there is a segment of the playerbase that doesn't like the latest update.  I get it.  Change is hard.  Sometimes things change in ways we don't like.Matches DO engage quicker.  And if you're team is not coordinating... yeah... you'll get caught with your pants around your ankles.  Ping the map and make sure you have your Buddy System engaged.But the core experience is still there.Do I still recommend this?  YES.  Get yer♥♥♥♥♥♥in here.  It's fun.  Snag a mate, because Teamwork is OP, and everything is more fun with a buddy.As a F2P experience, you're not going to lose much but a bit of time, and you'll gain that much more experience about what is going on in the industry for it.Find your ship, discover your playstyle, and blow up some bad guys.  Whatcha got to lose?I'll see you in The Void."

,Recommended,310380,16946538,"Posted: 8 July, 2015",all,CoolStory,"Essentially, the game's concept is MOBA + FPS session game + spaceships.Combat is 3-dimensional. Your ship has armor on 6 sides, and it can be damaged or destroyed. Your firing arc varies from ship to ship. Some ships have more turrets on the sides, some have strong frontal missiles etc. You must understand which ship can do what to win.The ship classes are all nice. Some, in my opinion, still need balancing and polishing, but they're all unqiue and have strengths and weaknesses. Massive Destroyer has long-range broadside batteries that tear smaller ships apart, and can take a beating, but its turrets are re-e-eally slow at tracking, so if somebody is attacking from behind it's going to die in 5 seconds. Hunter is one of the smallest ships, and its armor is lacking, but it can use short-range teleportation, and its frontal cannons, if aimed properly, can hit hard. Assassin can use stealth mode, Carrier can launch swarms of fighters, Sniper can deal massive damage at long range etc.There's no ""pay 2 win"" ships or options. ""Premium"" ships are just variants of existing ships with different subsystems and look. Whatever you fly, it's impossible to win without teamwork and coordination.The game is still in alpha, though it's already interesting to play. 80% of battles I played were back-and-forth, with all-out base attacks, last stands that turn the tide of the game, and sudden flanking maneuvers. I never regretted paying for it, as it has already earned its 10$.If you don't want to pay for an Early Access game (which is a common sentiment), it's going to be free-to-play when it's out of alpha state, and people who purchased it will get some exclusive stuff - a win-win situation in my book."

There aren't many balancing issues for the few people who I have seen online.I have a few complaints. There aren't enough people playing this game. I think the cause of this is from it being released in EA. People buy it and then either play a few matches and let it collect dust, or buy it and wait for it todevelope, but either way, the most people I have seen on is 22 so far.

Yes there's a grind for the higher tier ships but it literally states in the game that all ships are balanced (It's hard to not believe this when I go 22-4 in a starter ship). I also don't see the problem with the crates for crew as all crew have similar boosts in stats. They change 1-2% in each section but they're pretty similar. The wait times are a little long atm (about 2 mins-ish) but I dont mind that as when you get into a game with two teams that both know what they're doing a game can easily last upwards of half an hour. It is a tactical game with your ships, you have to learn how to use them properly and if you go blindly firing into a group of even 2 or more ships you are going to die. If you're smart with your attacks you can win a 1-1 but this is a team game and you need to work as a team to win.I enjoy this game and I'm also glad I supported it before it became F2P (albeit by complete accident!) and want it to grow into a nice game with a decent community.

That is all you will need to fight.-This game forces players to control themselves, judiciously push, dive and kill target, hold, retreat, think team, maximize your ship capabilities, and regroup if necessary for no ship is 1 man army while every ship strength do have its own non-apparent downside.-The community is pretty much great, although frustration can lead many  to go haywire. Taking a moment to help concide each others and atune a strategy is key to victory.-This game welcomes both, casual and deepest hardcore for any ship can help to victory or to a loss and there are NO ship better than others but again the group and the group composition will help to step on that sweet victory for extra XP and in game Cash!The developers work hard and pull maintenance every so often.

Doesn't mean its bad, just means that you will have to expect a bit of roughness starting out.It does require grind to get more than the starter ships.  Its not all that bad though.  The starter and lower tier ships are all plenty usable and balanced against the higher tier ships when flown well.  A higher tier ship does not mean better, contrary to what a first impression may give you.  What it means is that the higher tier ships are more specialized and difficult to fly well.  The monetization overall is fair, money can accelerate your progress slightly.  The variety of cosmetics is alright, this is a developing thing of course.  While I wish more customization was possible (custom pain jobs, logos, ship 'bling' would all be neat to see someday) there are some really nice looking skins available for ships.The game is a moba style game, capture mines, aquire resources, gain levels, win the game by pushing some sort of advantage all the way to the end.  The learning curve is steep, the tutorial is alright but there is far more to learn.  It is not a game where you can expect to do amazing the first few hours or days, but its very rewarding to get to this point.The game has a dedicated playerbase, if a bit on the smaller side.  Poke around the forums a bit and show yourself to the community.  To get the best experience for anything more than a short playthrough this is where the most fun can be.  The veterans of this game are passionate and want to share what they know to newer players, they want to keep the fresh blood flowing into it.  Flying solo can be extrodinarilly frustrating but with friends can be amazing once you all have the basics down or have a helpful vet with you.Overall, its a great game once you get past the larger and normal learning curve.  Its not all that gentle for a new player either.  The veterans want to share their love of the game and it makes it much better to play if you can put yourself in this.

For  this game (WITH MY WHOPPING 7 HRS) I am making an exception. Fractured Space is by far from perfect but the mix of MOBA with Spaceships is pretty awesome. I do feel however its missing something but I can't quite put my finger on it atm. Whether it be the additive of some npc or make it destruction of the objectives with the additive of turrets or some form of objective def.? Whatever the case may be this game does have some really good potential. The graphics are amazing the gameplay and controls are pretty well put and my only quarrel is that it does seem a bit grindy to be able to afford some of the ships but that makes it somewhat rewarding when you do fire up that new shiney spaceboat.So in my conclusion I def recomend this game and am hoping that the devolpement takes it further. Another downfall of FS, allbeit no fault of the devs is the community seems to be small and we the players of fractured space neeed to make sure that we don't push out the players that are just trying this game out because they are exactly what this game needs to continue being as good if not better then it is for me today."

It takes about a week to get approx. 500k credits, and by the time that happens you'll already get bored of the game, because you already just did the whole thing over and over again so many times and none of it changed ever at all. And oh boy, I don't even want to imagine how long it would take me to set up a full crew of characters I wanted to have in it, since they drop randomly in ""capsules"" that are about as expensive as ships.Also, multiplayer MM takes ages to get through due to the game being dead. But why is it dead? Oh, right, it's repetitive and not too replayable.Look at Warframe, that game is grindy as hell, yet it keeps itself replayable because it offers you so many ways to approach each mission in every sense of saying it, while keeping the whole thing intense and never letting you easily predict every single thing that would happen the next... entire match? All you have to do here is see whether your ship can take on the other ship or not and the rest of it is just point & click action with some 1/2/3/4 hotkey presses here and there. Basically, just like in any MOBA game ever, except more intense and smoother.So, all in all, the game will keep you playing it for some time, but it'll get boring way too soon, despite being epic and all that. If you really want space battles, find yourself something else instead, like EVE Online(subscription) or Battlestar Galactica(f2p), I guess."

I've watched the game evolve and grow into what it is today, and with the New Year approaching I'm going to knock off my resolution early and get my Review of Fractured Space done. At the time of writing this, I have 847 hours played. I can tell you as a veteran player this game has the stuff of greatness. The game plays in a similar but very different way every time you hit that ""Play"" button, every battle is unique. Edgecase Games are so accessible with their amazing Community Department, as well as the Forum Moderators, you can ask any question you like to them in the official Discord, the Steam forums, or on their frequent Q/A livestreams on Twitch and they'll get back to you within a day or two for the first two and a few minutes in the third. Other players are also more than happy to answer any questions you have about the way ships work, or strategies in the official Discord.At the moment, Fractured Space is a small game made by a small developer. There are certain realities of such that all players will have to deal with, i.e. low player numbers, 5-10 minute search times, a matchmaker that is designed for a large playerbase and so won't give you a perfect game (it'll come as close as it can), and a need to keep the lights on. You can, comfortably, play the game, never spend a penny, and have loads of fun. The grind is not bad, seriously. There are no ""better"" ships, in fact two of the strongest ships in the game are given to you right at the start. My biggest regret was not purchasing more of the founder edition packs at the end of the Early Access to support these great developers and this great game. Stick with it and encourage others to do the same and this game will go on for many years yet. I'll see you on the battlefield!July 14th 2017 review update: Still going strong, developers are still slaving away trying to make this game as good as it can be. There's a few large changes inbound, so the next few months might be a bit rocky with balance tweaks and new and interesting bugs, but on the whole the game is still going in a good direction and I'm proud to recommend it (just be prepared to deal with a work in progress game, the last of the Alpha placeholders are being removed and addressed)."

76561198124688371,Recommended,310380,32089748,Posted: 31 May,all,Rex,"This game has come such a long way.You begin with three ships, and they are all excellent at their job. This is not like other vehicle games where you crawl up a tree to ever more powerful vessels. The Pioneer is, bar none, the most balanced general purpose vessel in the game, and gets serious work done. The Sentinel is a swift interceptor, able to quickly engage other small ships or lance in to a brawl to provide fire support, but most importantly, it is your first fast ship, and succeeds not just as an interceptor but as a scout as well. Them finally we have the Venturer. An industrial mining vessel which requires clever thought to use. Not easy to immediately make effective, because she is a support vessel. Her mining lasers are great at carving weakened foe for fire support. Her rock breaker, meant to punch open asteroids for those lasers, is good for weakening enemy armor, and couples well with her lasers, and her healing pulse technique keeps her in the fight and allies as well, if they're close.General Purpose Combat VesselRecon / Rapid ResponseSupport Fire / HealerThese are your choices when you first begin. You will continue to see these ships employed through out your career in this game, but if none of them quit fit your fancy, there is a whole wide range of vessels to pick from. From the dreadnought-like Destroyer, to the Paragon-class carrier. Turret deployers, long range ""sniper"" vessels that are just a single huge gun with a few boosters strapped to it, cloaking hit and run vessels, and even the mighty Gladiator, if you want to fight with a full broadside like a Tall Ship of old.. just mind the shorter ranges that come with that when facing off against more modern designs.Because everything is balanced.Or, in the process of being balanced.Ships which have been around longer and are properly balanced, with little likelihood of being changed, are cheap and easy to pick up, no matter their size, speed, fire power, or number of team support utility options. Newer ships have prohibitive costs, relegating them to less use, in order for their combat numbers to be analyzed and to better assess how to balance them with future patches. You can expect changes to be made to your shiny expensive ship if you opt to get one, so be careful.Play style wise, we're looking at what qualifies as a MOBA, but plays like a third person space shooter with capital ships as your only available vessels. The littler boats can swing around more like a heavy bomber, but the big 'uns move as you expect, more or less. Fighters, bombers, and drones exist, but all as deployable pets which function to wipe out other pets, tie up point defenses, crack heavy ship armor, slow down or sap an opponent's engne power, or any number of other things to deal more damage or ruin their combat strategy.Off the battle field, you have a handful of weapon or gear options for each ship, and crew which you can assign. The crew is a bit strange in how you obtain them, but they all come with interesting art, excellent voice acting, and interestig back stories. Expect them to talk to you a lot in combat, letting you know what's going on with your ship. They also will trash talk at other ships occasionally, which is funny.Be mindful not to let your ship get sunk, or they'll yell at you too, by the way!That sums up the most important bits. Money ship for some skins does exist, you can use real money to quickly get what you otherwise have to grind money for. Some expected basics of a free to play game, but no gold ammo, no gold-only ships. There's a few seasonal skins, such as the Olympics skins, or seasonal crew, like the dead man's ghost you can get during Halloween, but really I think that's it as far as restrictions.It's fun, and it's free now, so there's no reason not to try it out if you like big space ship games. Give it a whirl, you have nothing to lose except for potentially dozens if not hundreds of hours of your life to highly addictive game play set alongside stunning visuals employing some of the most ""real feeling"" space ships I've ever seen in a video game."

,Recommended,310380,33482854,Posted: 12 July,all,Nemesismax,"This game filled one of the gaps that I was trying to fill in gaming; Fluid space battle with semi-fast pace.Fractured Space gives you a nice gameplay in its own category. To be honest I was scared at first since I do not have too much good experience with F2P games (in regards to most of them being P2W). But after giving it a try, I'm glad.When it comes to ships, you can literally buy any ships that the game is offering (without spending a penny, tho you can still buy them with money but that won't create a huge impact between players)Starting ships are quite decent and depending on the situation, quite balanced as well. You can simply play with your starting ship for days to farm and get one of those heavy defense ships.There are 2 ways to earn credits, the safe way or the hard way. Safe way is against bots (co-op/qickplay) where your team mostly consists of human players and you fight against AI, slightly boring but a sure win at the end. But since you're playing against AI, the payment is rather on the lower side.Then there is the hard way when you play against players. Rewards are plenty and you get some real joy. Don't get scared by those heavy 900.000 credit ships. Like I've said before, starter ships are balanced in a way that with the right strategy, you can still take those down.As for the maps, I'm not too fond of small maps and there are only 2 types of game modes at the moment. But I'm sure that they'll implement new game modes as the game gets populated.Even if this review seems lacking, try to give Fractured Space a try and you be the judge."
76561198240650022,Not Recommended,310380,29886901,Posted: 12 February,all,hiall2147,"I'll make it short and sweet. FS is a F2P spaceship game, and all game-changing items can be bought without spending a penny. You will, however, require a grind to get some desired items, requiring about a week of daily playing to get the expensive stuff. Unless you want money wasted, be very cautious of buying DLC for this game, and if you are, buy something related to crew/implants, or ask others. Gameplay is typical of a MOBA: Capture bases, capture the enemy's home base, defend, etc, but with no minions. 5 ships on 2 teams ""Jump"" onto 2 lanes to capture bases that grant access to a home base. A third lane, known as gamma, has only one capture point. This point is activated every few minutes to grant buffs to whoever captures it. PVP, PVE, training, and a firing range for all ships is included. This game's combat/defense system is based on cooldown-based abilites. The game's vareity is in its ships and crew/implants.The pros of this game are in style and potential. To me at least, the genre of capital-spaceship games are quite few, let alone a F2P one. Depending on some players, this game can be fun to play sometimes. But since I can't speak for all players, deciciding whenever or not the game is fun depends on you. The F2P model is acceptable and does not discriminate game-wise between a paying and an expierenced player. And that's all of the pros I can find.The cons are rather blatant in this game. First off, matchmaking timing is a well known issue. Expect some occasional disconnects from lobbies, usually due to some players leaving before a game has begun. Second, there is only very basic game balance, with some ships being insanely overused and with others being insanely underused. If you hate metas, this game may not be for you. Third, the in-game community can be quite toxic. Forth, it is very easy to have ""snowball"" games - games of which are just lost from early on or are clearly doomed to be lost by an often meta setup of the enemy team. Fith, gamma is too short and too game-impacting in my opinion, as games can be won by an event lasting only a mere minute or two in a 20-30 minute game. Sixth, capping is extremely ""encouraged"" to win games. The saying is that if you can't cap, you suck. Even if you are ranking number 1 for damage ratios and around number 15 for K/D ratios, you're still crap if you can't cap - according to the communinty (See point ""Third"".) As a matter of fact, I hold those leaderboard positions.I keep playing the game just for the leaderboards, and occasionally I have to focous on my goals rather than my dissolving team in order to have a reason to keep on playing. I play a rarely used ship, and I'm very good at it, but it tends to feel underpowered (*cough* USR destroyer is OP  *cough*.)Overall, try and see if you would like it, but for now, I won't recommend it for the average gamer.

It's a MOBA structured similarly to other MOBA's like League of Legends but you command massive ships on your way to glory. It's currently in Open Development meaning the gameplay is changing constantly and the proposed update with Phase 3 is very exciting. There are around 50 playable ships and each one has a place on the team. Even better, the community is suprisingly docile and it takes a lot for players to be upset. If you love other MOBA's but feel like they may be too fast paced or you struggle to stay ""competitive"" then Fractured Space will give you a welcome break.Why shouldn't you play it?It is a Free to Play game, but in game purchases make your life a whole lot better. It takes a long while to gain enough credits to buy any ship that isn't 110,000. Additionally, gameplay can change dramatically with new updates. Lastly, the playerbase is pretty low, which constitutes fairly long wait times when loading a match.Overall:This is a phenomenal game plagued by issues that are common with new and underrecognized developers.

Combat feels a bit slow and clunky, situational awareness is tricky at times, specially in Frontline where enemies can jump to the same point you just hopped to and spawn behind you. TTK is sort of drawn out, and escapes are tricky if you're in close. I'm sure the combat and game style might appeal to some people, but not me.On top of that, I didn't have much luck finding ANY matches, vs AI or otherwise, and in order to get more crews, you have to slog through their own version of gambling boxes where you could feasibly spend tons of money and never get what you want.TL;DR: Slow clunky combat, little luck with matchmaking, Gatcha Boxes and everyone who employ them need to be kicked in the teeth, and not much variety to gameplay.

If you're a new player then I recommend jumping right in. The visuals are spectacular and the gameplay is incredibly addictive. Clearly I'm an optimist about this game but I won't deny some faults, namely that you can jump into a match where the players are toxic or refuse to strategise.For a F2P game, this one is very good. If you haven't been enjoying it after a match or two once you get the hang of the strategy then uninstall it. Period. I don't understand this ""bad matchmaking"" criticism I've been hearing. I play from europe and I've never had to wait more than 2 mintutes to find a match. And after that I've never been dropped from one.This game really shines when you have 2 teams with good humour and spirit who will listen to each other. But it also involves some very satisfying tactics depending on the different ships and you will find yourself either using your abilities to turn the tide of a battle or a dogfight or making a narrow escape to heal or regroup.People complain about this game being a grind. But unlike war thunder or world of tanks, you aren't grinding to get always better ships, you're grinding to get different ones. After I had rounded out my collection a little bit I was just playing to have fun. Sometimes I'd have the massive surfboard and lumber up to a control point and absorb fire while fighting off up to 3 enemies while my team could offer me help, other times I used the artillery cruiser to snipe, or in frontline mode I'd use it to quickly flank and deliver a massive shot to the enemy team's healer killing him outright or making him move out from cover. So yeah, I had a ton of fun even when losing and I would say that if you play this game to grind out all the ships then you're doing it wrong."

They just saw the one chage and lost their minds over something so small.The game gives you a crew for your ships, the starter crew is fine for ~90% of the ships. By the time you unlock the higher tier ships you will have unlocked the few different crew members that will give you the stats you're looking for.To say it again, Fractured Space is an amazing game that has only gotten better over time. Please don't listen to these short sightted people about the recent patch."

You pick your ship, crew loadout and jump into battle. Pretty simple. Once there, you have yourself a map with grand total of 5 sectors you can jump between. Top and bottom sectors are respectevely enemy's and yours bases, 2 sector on left and right are where the actions usually is and center one is something that makes this game unique and not just ""DotA in space"". In the moddle of the sector there is a big capture point that is inactive most of the time. Once in awhile this point activates and anyone can cap it. Whoever caps it gets team wide buff that increases cap rate, damage and resistance. This buff can turn around whole game if played right. The leveling mechanic is also different from most MOBAs. On the map you have mining outposts that give resources to whichever team has the outpost. Your level depend on ammount of resources your team has so everyone on the team has the same level.That seems a lot for a short explanation of the game. But all those mechanics are easy to follow once you play couple of matches.For the ships there aren't that many ships right now but more is coming surely and even what is already there has a lot of variety in gameplay and strategy plus you have loadouts that change gameplay. Ships besides guns have 4 abilities. For example, some ships have blink (there are 2 different kinds of blinks), some have boosts, some shields etc. etc. Some ships are good against some ships and not so against other. Overall the game is balanced quite well so far.A few words about looks: this game looks pretty darn good, especially for an early acces game. Most textures are very detailed, models are too, especially ships. Lighting is very good. Overall the graphics remind me of E:D.The game looks very promising and if you are a fan of either Smite (or MOBAs in general) or WoT\WT (and likes) or you are just like space as much as me, I would recomend you to get this game. Not only you'll get some good and unique expirience, you'll help the game grow. Right now there is around 50-100 players online at all times and it's not a problem to find a match.That's my 2 cents."
,Recommended,310380,29451185,Posted: 23 January,all,A Tree™,"tldr ; 9/10 game, balanced well, paid services are no issue at all.I don't know how I don't have more hours in this game, it sure seems like I do.The game: I absolutely love it. It feels polished,  its nice to play, its smooth, it looks brilliant.Updates: It gets updated regularly, I came back after a week or so to see new graphics and tutorials, teaching new guys to play the game.Balancing: All of the ships are balanced towards each other, in the right scenario any ship will beat another (with the odd execption, e.g. light support craft vs heavy defensive). There are a few tweaks which need to be made here and there, but do notice the devs making these changes.IMPORTANT NOTE: People have complained about the paid services for ships, however, this is not an issue. This is because although you can pay for 'better' ships, they are not actually better, I still believe the Pioneer (the first ship I EVER played with), is one of the best in the game. But, I didn't like the way it felt, I prefered heavier ships, ones which felt like space tanks. These new ships cost in game money - and I played a few games and got enough to buy them. Now I have a few ships (7 or so - might be wrong on that figure) but I don't really need many more. Out of the ships i have I do not play with them all, I have found what gameplay style I like and I stick with it. Although a ship may cost more money, doesn't mean its better. One of the support ships in the game costs twice as much as many more. There are pros and cons to every ship, but I will reiterate what I've said before: every ships is balanced. I've been in a Glad (heavy armour with broad sides) and been killed by two smart supports who simply out manuevered me.I love this game. Its free. Why haven't you already downloaded it and tried it yet?PS. There are a few mechanics which need to be learnt, and having a test with each of the ships is helpful - you don't know how to avoid an enemy if you don't know they're about to stop you in your tracks whilst another pulls you in!"

Original review:I am not going to review the game itself here, but I want to give some info that I feel was not clear enough. The game in itself is fun, period. I like the graphics, the gameplay and the feel of the game and I think it is easy enough to find info on the gameplay itself. Steam forces me to chose wether I recommend it or not, though, so I have to chose to not recommend it. Here is why:What you have to know is that upon release the game is going to be __Free to Play__. Admittedly this is written in the Early Access Statement here on the store page that I did not read, cause I did not expect a paid  game that will later become free. Is this bad? Not necessarily, but it is unexpected.According to their forums [1] their plans include non-exclusive ships that have bonus boosts and ""an exclusive crew member"". Is this Pay2Win? Not necessarily, but it could be.The extra copies (Scavenger Keys) bought with the Fleet packs are only Game-Access-Keys. Once the game is released your gifted friends have nothing more than everybody else using the Free2Play-Version. Add to that stats-wipes could happen (if anybody knows a clear statement from the Devs about this, I would be glad for a hint in the comments) and I kind of feel some regret for having bought the game now to gift the extra copies to friends.I do not blame myself for having been under the impression of buying a normal early access game with extra copies, but neither do I blame the developers, it was just unexpected and it happens. I take them by their word that the money spent will be worth it, not doubting that, but I cannot be sure at this point either.What I complain about though is that the necessary information is not easy to find or emphasized. It is there, but scattered and hidden in the early access description, as well as their own forums (which were not working this evening when I wanted to read up on their plans and what the packs actually mean). It takes a bit of reading to understand what you are buying for real.My opinion is: As long as it is not 100% clear how the boosts and paid extras will work and affect the game it may be better to wait for clarity. Especially, because of one of their statements found at [2] is:""There are a few other things we’re currently discussing (i.e. possibly making soft currency purchasable, and the potential for a subscription model)""[1]https://www.fracturedspace.com/forums/index.php?p=/discussion/142/founder-packs-the-great-debate[2]https://www.fracturedspace.com/fractured-space-and-f2p-mechanics/"

It's slow, tactical, and can be REALLY punishing for new players.  Make no mistake, reaction speed plays almost no part in this game.  Instead, you'll need to plan ahead and stay aware of where everything sits in the 3D space.  Knowing your own ship, your allies' and your opponents' will take some time and until you do the nasty surprises will keep on coming.But if you're looking for a good space combat multiplayer, this really brings the fantasy to life.  Everything feels heavy and meaningful,  and your crew jabbering in your ear about how badly you're getting pounded really gives you that sense of commanding a big space submarine.  Do take advantage of the in-game tutorial videos, as they cover all the key points that will help you win.As a closing note, a lot of recent reviews have been slamming the devs for the new implant system, and I have to agree.  It's a system that rewards long term (or big spending) players (like myself) with potentially huge advantages which is only going to make it harder few new players to succeed.  That said, I still don't think it's any substitute for a good team, and you'll find that when your team works together well, the stats mean a lot less.Solo grandstanding will get you nothing here, regardless of how many stat boosts you have."

Armor is a tricky thing to track because there really is no way to tell how much armor you have unless you don't have any in that one spot.

You can see how the ships will be upgradable to a certain point which lets players play ships as they like.  Probably the most frustrating thing as a new player is that it takes time to become good at this game, if you can give it some time you will enjoy it.Pros:* Different ships and they play differently (not just different skins)* Every ship can be countered* Every ship is a viable choice to play* Solid gameplay* Devs are doing a good job of relasing patches regularly.Cons:* Wish for more diverse victory option then capture the base (may be comming in future release)"

76561198123242224,Not Recommended,310380,26075902,"Posted: 16 October, 2016",all,Prophet,"Pro:- It`s free to play.- You can command big ships with big guns- It takes time to learn the ships vulnerabilities and strengths- Teamwork is essential for Winning...you can't do it alone- Gorgeous spaceships- Great number of shipsCon:- No in game voice- for a game that puts so much accent on teamwork the lack of easy communication with your teammates is annoying....yeah you have a chat...try to tell the healer to support you in the middle of a batle, and most of the time nobody watches the massages. OK you have Quick commands if you hit TAB...but realy....how the heck should a team make any tactical plan or change that on the fly in the middle of the battle? Well for the time being you can't. You die and tipe a massage that will or will not be seen by your team mates....and i can tell you most of the time it makes the game frustrating.- Every upgrade is the same (loadouts) - different name, different damage or cooldown but at the end it will make the same damage or the same healing or less. The Base weapons that you get with the ships are more then sufficient there is no need to buy upgrades, it`s just a waste of credits.Just to give you an example:- Destroyer:- Main weapon default stats: 25000Km max 15000Km optimal range - Volley 6 - 100ppd(ppd?) reload 1.5s- that is 400dps (damage/second) - free- Main weapon upgrade one: 25000Km max 15000Km optimal range Volley 6 - 73ppd relpoad 1.095s - that is 400dps (damage/second) - 46200 Credit- Main weapon upgrade two: 25000Km max 15000Km optimal range - Volley 6 - 130ppd(ppd?) reload 2s- that is 390dps (damage/second) - 46200 CreditAnd they all have same projetile speed and life time 3.571s x 7000m/s wich in turn is the max distans the projectile can travel.- Destroyer Jamming abbility:- Default: Range 10000km duration 10s Cooldown 45s - that means in 3min time i can use it 4 times totaling a 40s gamming of enemy ships.- Upgrade one: Range 8000km duration 6s Cooldown 32s - that means in 3 min time i can use it 5.625 times totaling 33.75s enemy jamming- Upgrade two: Range 12000km duration 15s Cooldown 77s -  that means in 3 min time i can use it 2.34 times totaling 35.06s enemy jammingIn my opinion if you have upgrades or loadouts that u can buy for credits at least they should be giving you an advantage even if a little one. But as it seems they give you a disadvantage instead plus taking large sums of credits. So for me buying loadouts is just waisting credits.- No sense of progress - Yes you get experience and you have a progress bar that fills up and you get ranks and such LVLs that you can reach...but...i could not see any benefit. Now i`m lvl 20 and i`m a Group Marshal... dont know what it means did not get any special ability with it just a title i guess. Ships are not locked and loadouts aren't either so leveling besides the sense of progression has no meaning in game. Oh buy the way other players wont see all of this in game (just at the leader board) or in the lobby so whats the point?- Goals - every game needs to offer a goal to players otherwise you will loose interest in that game fast. Now in Fractured Space your main goal is to get credits to unlock the ships, there is no need to upgrade them because most ships dont have upgrades, and the ones that have are with no benefit to you,it's just a waste of credits. It`s better to spend it on ships. So what other goals you have in game....none.If you paid for the pack that unlocks most of the ships in game...well....you managed to eliminate the single gol that you could have...but you still can have a good time with friends or solo i guess.- Lack of maps. There are 2 different types of maps Conquest and Frontline. Conquest is basically a capture the enemy base and the Frontline is a deathmatch. Conquest has two types of maps Frontline only one. Most of the time you will play Conquest (80-90%).- I can`t see other players lvl - it`is not visible in the lobby or in game. So i dont know if Tom is a lvl 10 or 30 which would give me some idea what can i expect from him.In general the game is unforgiving to solo (lone wolf) players. Teamwork is required to win. And it's frustrating when everyone stack`s in one sector unwilling to jump to the other one. Your medic goes way in front and kill`s himself, your team mates ar still capturing mines when the enemy is at your home base capturing it. And not to mention team mates trying to jump away while under attack resulting in their death, leaving you alone against overwhelming numbers..it's among the first things that you learn not do in the Tutorial...sowhy...why???. So yes it can be frustrating at times..but it`s free to play so there is that. With limited communications you are left to put you faith in the team mates awareness and experience. And prey that they will look at the map not just go blindly an fight.But there are some occasions when experienced players come toughader...players who know to watch the messages and use quick commands to let there team know what to do or warn them....then....then glorious battles take place...some time you will have the rare opportunity to turn the tide, or even get your team the advantage it needs to win.. So it`s not all bad...but it needs conviction...patience..and cooperation. But most of all patience for not having the means to communicate simple but important things during intense battle like on wich ship to focus fire. Its seams puny...not important...but when you are outnumbered focusing fire on one ship or telling your team mate not to rush ahead alone could turn the tide.Maybe with time all the above will change and my review will change to a positive one, until then i will have patience :)."

I really enjoy the way each ship handles differenlty and how some are more flexible than others at the cost of having as much of a strength in another area. The ships are mathmatically balanced with a variety of factors. say one ship fires a homing projectile as its main guns. as a result the projectile will do less damage or travel more slowly or something to balance the fact that it will follow and hit the target regardless of its movments. Some ships have all the guns pointing forwards. meing keeping the forward part of your boat can be the difference between 50 % damage and 100 % damage.all the ships have a different play style even if they do have some similar but not identical tricks. I wish more people played this game so that it could be played more rapidly . only downside is that MM can take a while .games last about 15-30 mins

There is nothing you can buy that will make you good or give you any advantage at all (some minor stuff, % based, all of which you can get from just playing.  I have been playing is almost the beggining and I consider it a complete waste of money to 'buy' anything to be better). I will even challenge anyone who thinks otherwise...you 'buy' and upgrade anything you want and I will fly any starter ship with no crew or upgrades and smoke ya... What this games needs is a sustained marketing campaign which I believe is coming once some more bugs are iorned out.BTW, it seems there are some children with no paitence making reviews.

They could put down a real stinker of a game with crappy graphics and worse gameplay and it would still be OK since its free!.But.The graphics are nice, well rounded no nosence fluid graphics.Gameplay is fun, the divesity of the ships and the effects they can have on fights make the game actually fun to play.It is fast pased without feeling rushed, the game has room for tactical players rushers and relaxed layabouts because of the ships in game. It does require you to play it a bit to unlock ships. witch you can shortcut by dishing out your money. But 1-2 days of playing will see you sporting 1 or 2 new ships with the specs that you prefer. or close enoug to it to save for the whopper you want.No single ship is to overpowerd or underpowered in general, as long as you read about the ships role and strong and weak points.Only negatives about the game:Small player base. Sadly dispite that its a good free tactical shooter there are none to many players (my reason for review) so it takes a little bit to find games, esp without bots.The AI is stuuuuuuuuuuupid. I mean lobotomized cockroach stupid. Granted I have seen worse (even from players) but it is bad.And lastly, Few game modes. There is one good game mode (conquest, basicly king of the hill meets capture the flag) it could use a few more. allthough honestly I cant realy think of .. oh wait. just did.  Team Battle royal.My reason for making a review:I make few reviews.. actualy.. I might have only done 1 before. Usualy the games I play are not good enough for me to waste time to review.This game is good: If you like shooters, tactical play, low gameplay requirement games and space/sci fi inspired fighting.

All are very much brilliant, anyone who enjoys not only a challenge, but internet spaceships, this game is definitively recommended. I would ask anyone and everyone i could reach to at the very least TRY this game, they might enjoy it, they might actively support it.HOWEVER.I can truthfully say that after just 6 hours of play i have found a substitute for my hatred of MMO games. From World of Tanks to Fractured space, this game has more than earned my hate. I have had enough.Price. Prices and costs on ships, crew, equipment and supplies are absolutely ludicrously extortionately high. For a PVE ONLY player like myself, the ridiculous grind of spending up to 30 minutes PER GAME against an AI that is ridiculously hard, ITS JUST NOT WORTH IT. Ships start at 150 000 credits, but each battle nets me on average LESS THAN 20K. Prices for ships can go into the millions. Prices for crew can go into the millions. The game is perfectly, brilliantly balanced, but your corporate greed destroys it. DEAR GAME DEVELOPERS. WE HATED THE GRIND THEN. WE HATE THE GRIND NOW. WE WILL HATE THE GRIND FOREVER. Prices for platinum (premium currency) are standard fare for any MMO game, but if youre an F2P, avoid this game unless you have a very high tolerance for failure, and a LOT of spare time.But aside from the mindbending grind, the game is damn beautiful.

YOu are flying capital ships, not zippy little fighters like in other space combat games. its a very unique take and very well done. tehre are diferent roles you can play on the team and with over 30 ships there is a lot of different combinations for success and endless matchups and counter matchups to learn.positioning is always important because of how long it takes to turn around or change direction, if you over-extend you are done for and could cost your team gamma. Honestly, ive played since alpha, and even then it wasnt very buggy, but it is even better now. they optimzed the engine a lot so it doesnt take 2 minutes to launch, and the FINALLY got rid of that terrible ship select screen and replaced it with a more tradition moba character select.this game is legit, and its free, the only things that you have to pay to unlock are skins and cosmetic changes, or you can pay to unlock ships.

This is by no means a deal breaker personally but your milage may vary. Once they actually start advertising this game for full release that should be fixed anyway.My favourite ship is one of the underpowered ones :(Overall this game is well worth your time if you're looking for a team game which is a little deeper than usual.I give this game 4.5 Scrundles out of 5."

76561198028788330,Recommended,310380,32780132,Posted: 25 June,all,XeroMan,"Warning: The game doesn't have a large player base (yet) so teams are usually terribly mismatched in experience and skill. New players can be greeted by rage from vets when they start losing. A small toxic part of the community can ruin this game.  I feel bad for the dev's - they can't generate a player base out of thin air, and can't change the one they have. Maybe the devs could enable a mute feature like World of Tanks so you can play in peace.That being said, the game is dynamic with a wide range of ships that are truly unique. A lot of effort has gone into this game, and it shows. It's a great game. Strategic choices to choose grouping up on either alpha or beta lanes, or splitting between the two. Tactical decisions on who to target first, to stick around for a fight, which flank to turn to which enemy. The fact that there is armor to front, back, sides, top and bottom really adds complexity to the game more than you'd think. While not as in depth as world of tanks with their hit boxes, it is very effective at injecting planning into battles. Each ship has a role that when learned can be very effective. So really there is something for everyone:- cloaked assasins hiding, waiting for someone to jump (very vulerable) then decloaking and wiping them out- in close brawlers who can deal tremendous punishment- heavy armor that soaks up punishment and deals it out- healers- utilities that vary widely from dropping automated turrets, fighters/bombers, bouys that can detect, heal or reduce damage in an areaAgain, each ship is unique with a combination of different attacks, attack arcs, utilities and defences. One ship might have limited arcs but be very strong in that arc (ie broadside or forward firing) while another ship might have fast firing, low damage homing weapons that can fire in any direction. All of this adds up to a tremendous variety in play styles.I initally did not recommend this game due to some of the people who play it, but that was grossly unfair to the dev's who have done so much for this game. I apologize to the devs for that."

,Not Recommended,310380,26608765,"Posted: 14 November, 2016",all,Zazzmatazz,"Fractured Space is a MOBA lane-driven capital ship shoot-em-up where your objective is to destroy the enemy's base.  That is, if you could ever land a sufficiently skilled team.I don't really have a problem with most aspects of the game.  All ships can be purchased with ingame currency that you can earn,  the combat is comprehensive and unique for each ship.  The Solo vs. AI mode is very fun, albeit slow, given the challenging nature of using your own ship.However, this is all blatantly killed by the multiplayer.  Multiplayer is based around MMR, like most MOBAs.  This is all fine and dandy if you don't consider that there aren't enough players simultaneously playing to make that matter.  Matchmaking takes forever, and usually you are left with a team of new players vs. a team of professionals.  I have played 50 matches, and won a total of 3, and two of those were due to players on the enemy team disconnecting.  My MMR has plummeted to 18, but that doesn't mean anything with the matchmaking system.Another nitpicky thing is the maps.  For close range ships, they are fine.  For long range ships, there is simply WAY too much cover for enemy vessels.  In certain lane types, such as Pillars, this renders ships like the Destroyer or the Watchman entirely useless.  This is doubly bad when you consider that you have no insight on this when selecting your ship, and that you may not change your ship after you have joined.  Wouldn't an advanced, capital ship wielding faction have knowledge about the area they are going to attack before they send their ships in?I would not recommend this game to my friends, or anyone, unless they only play solo, or are masochists.

(knock-on-wood)cons:-Long wait times to join a lobby (5-20 minutes)-On some level it's pay-to-play, though I've never spent a dime over my founders pack when the game was not free to play, you gain credits in game which you can spend on implants, crew packs, and ships.  It just takes a long time.-Patch 3 introduced really REALLY R-E-A-L-L-Y small lanes for conquest mode which has removed almost all strategy from the game turning it into a fight pit, jump in a shoot.  This also has caused all the ships to become unbalanced, being able to basically blink jump between mining stations, making certain ships useless, etc.  If you want a fast space shooter then that is what Fractured Space has become, if you want a strategy space shooter like it was, it's no longer here."

But game is too bugged to be recommendable currently.There are some minor bugs, which is fine in a beta, but I have yet to play a match without someone disconnecting. And in a 5v5 match where new players can't join, a single disconnect will determine the outcome of the game. People also don't want to surrender, because the match making is bugged (constantly finds a match, someone can't connect, so you're thrown back into the queue), and they don't want to wait to find a new match.The game have a very loud ""match is ready"" sound, which you'll hear several times before you actually gets into a match. And it can't be disabled other than muting master volume.The servers are also either overloaded or have a horrible connection. I'm used to getting 50ms ping in most games, in Fractured Space I get 200-300ms and the game doesn't handle it very well. So you will slow down to a full stop for a second or two, and then everyone rubberbands all over the place. The game claims to have European servers, but maybe that it just a lie, and US players will get a better experience.The keybindings can be remapped, but the interface for that is also full of bugs, including one where certain actions will disapear until you revert to default.

I get frustrated when it feels like everyone on the battlefield hits you like freight train and no matter how you outmanuever or fire at what might be a weakspot you seem to do minimal damage. If the progression rate for your ship happened at a decent rate I could accept that BUT since it's so grindy you'll find yourself asking, why? Why should I continue to play and get my bell rung continuously feeling like it's not because of my skill but it's because the person I'm fighting has more time to play the game? So I can grind up to the next gun and THEN I can finally feel competitive? It's the Call Of Duty kicking puppies MM and it's something that I think definitely won't make this game accessible to players that don't have a lot of time on their hands.If they had a tiered matchmaker or skill based matchmaker to even things out I would be happy to continue to grind and fight to get to higher levels but as it stands I just don't like being abused because devs don't want to balance their game.The game is objective based which is something I like and there is a constant sense of urgency to protect certain points and strategize to capture the enemy base. Unfortunately this also leads to problems in terms of teams not having a single ioda of map awareness which will more than likely get worse as the F2P crowd comes in looking for a space shootem up and find that they may actually have to switch on their brain. This leads to another point about the game that ultimately discourages me from playing. The matches ARE NOT reasonable in length. 30 minute matches are just way too long and take a lot of investment to play. IF they were balanced matches it might not be so bad BUT when you couple it with poor progression and no matchmaker, it results in a game that's just all around frustrating and sometimes just downright draining.It's a shame because the actual game play aspects are really fun. The firing and accuracy feel pretty smooth, movement takes some getting used to but it works well enough, the abilities of each ship brings a different dynamic to each match and lets you find which playstyle works best for you. It's got a lot of really great elements that unfortunately are overshadowed.Keep in mind it is still in alpha so things may change and I hope they do BUT as for now I'd rather move on to something fun to play.Edit: After some discussion in the comments from the devs I think I've been able to come to a much better conclusion here than how my original viewpoints stand. While my original opinion of the game still stands in a lot of ways the comments from the devs have given me hope for this game's future. It is apparent to them as well that the matchmaking system needs work and I think that's ultimately the biggest underlying issue here. They have assured me that there will be a solution in the future to alleviate problems for new players.They've also sort of tackled the issue of progression, upgradeables and balance but I'm still not entirely satisfied with the answers given yet, we'll see in future updates and as the game progresses how big of an advantage these ""side"" upgrades are comparatively. They have taken the time to talk to just one consumer and that shows an immense level of care very few companies have and that alone almost warrants a purchase of this game. Keep up the good work Edgecase and while my feedback is negative right now that is likely to change in the future given your attention and care to the game."

Better than Dreadnought, after that one went all Wargaming on us with its tier system. Ship customisation isnt that deep, but on the other hand you have 30-odd ships with different mechanics - too much customisation would make it hard to work out what a ship is and what it does.The grind is actually pretty forgiving, with lots of daily login rewards and even more rewards if you play a certain number of matches in a day.Most of the other reviews on here seem to read like:Oh no! I can start a game and not worry whether or not I can finish before the next ice age!Oh noes! Implants offer tiny bonuses like +0.8 percent damage and take a little while to grind for!Queue times are a little long - 1-3 minutes normally, sometimes up to 6. I alt-tab and play Faeria single player in the meantime because I'm impatient - there's an audio notification when you get into a game, so it works quite well."

They form a significant part of how potential players evaluate new games. Sticking a great big red thumb against a game has a hugely negative effect on its reputation, it’s potential player base and the dev team themselves.So, before you cry into your keyboard about how credit rewards have been reduced somewhat and therefore the game is now unplayable tosh, please have a little more respect.  You have had what? Two hundred hours of almost entirely free, engrossing, beautiful, space-based MOBA action unlike anything else on the market, and now you hate it? Please, grow up. If you disagree with an aspect of the game's development, then surely the way to express that is through constructive criticism on the discussion pages? Not a big red brand on the store page.This game is so clearly a labour of love and the result of amazing dedication from the dev team. I have been playing on and off since last February and no other game has had the same draw on me as this in the past year. I have paid again and again for cosmetic items I do not need, simply out of a desire to support the (ever continuing) work of the team behind it. I long ago unlocked most of the ships and crew, but I continue to play simply for the experience.I realise that this little rant in no way constitutes a review.

SKINS, CARL, FOR 250 HOURS, WHICH I CAN JUST BUY FOR IN-GAME CURRENCY IN SOME R6:SIEGE. NICE SLAP IN THE FACE, DEVS.Disadvantages:- Severe grind- Starter ships are very bad, except the sentinel. Especially the pioneer, but you still have to grind on it if you want to open new ships.- Unfriendly Community- Developers wiped all the progress, made the grind really miserable and gave no equal compensation to their supporters.- Players are not actually interested in teamwork, since you need to get as much kills as you can to open new ships, Hello grind.- The only thing developers make is Adding Grind, In-game Real Money Purchases and Banning People who don't like their game.- Small Aircraft is still not Balanced, after a year.- Developers Encourage Fanboys and Trolls- Broken Balance and Development trees.- Matchmaking often puts you on a moon server with 200-400 ping against Some nerd-donaters on Tier 5 ships, while your team consists of noobs on starter suckships.________________________________________________________________Убогое:- Суровый и Беспощадный Гринд.- Все стартовые корабли испоганили, кроме сентинеля, в особенности пионера, но на нем все равно придется гриндить, если вы хотите продвинуться в ветке кораблей USR- Необъективное и Агрессивное Коммьюнити- Разработчики Сбросили весь прогресс, Отобрали все вещи, а взамен не удосужились предложить абсолютно ничего эквивалентного.- Игроки теперь не заботятся о командной работе, ведь игра стала симулятором гринда. Убивать врагов, получать экспу, все дела.- Баланс у малых космолетов все еще не запилен, спустя год.- Все, чем занимаются разработчики: Добавляют в игру гринд, донат и бан пользователей, выступающих против последних нововведений.- Разработчики Поощряют фанбоев и троллей.- Сломанный Баланс и Последовательность открытия кораблей в ветках.- Игра в 99% случаев кидает тебя на лунный сервер с пингом под 200-400. Против З.адротов-Фанбоев, уже открывших самые дорогие корабли. А кто же находится в вашей команде?

The lack of counter-play used is astounding. Snipers are somehow a ship, and yes, they will in fact shoot you from across the map. Repeatedly. In fact, they'll be so far out there that the game won't even identify them as enemy or ally.The pacing is schizophrenic, and the lack of a ship change mid-game can leave you joining a team that really could use a different ship then the one you are using.Finally, the community is surprisingly toxic for such a new dev team.

I didn´t had these problems in the beginning, but since they just keep adding new Ships so you have something to grind its just getting worse. You have to wait about 5-10 min for a most likely inbalanced game.About the Ship-Balancing itself: There is an insane amout of variaties its impossible to propaly balance them. They have cool mechanics but the hard combos arent really rewarding and you are better of playing an easy ship.Try it if its free , but dont spent money on it until they fix their stuff"

There's no single player content, matches take a long time to get started, and since the gameplay is so slow, they take up to an hour each. Normally a long match means the teams are evenly matched, or that the objectives take time but with this game, the matches take so long because all your ship can do is crawl through space.The playerbase is small, and so far it has been mostly negative - other players are often caustic and immediately resort to childish or abusive behavior if you're not playing exactly the want they want you to.

I've been a supporter of this game since November of 2014 when it was released on steam. I was one of the first players on it and I stayed through the lowest periods in the games history (♥♥♥♥♥ing about 53 players on a low point? Please). I saw the introduction of every single ship in the game, all of the wipes, the grind system, and now the new crew system (more grind).This game has lost its focus. I'm not complaining about development time, I'm complaining about the direction. I bought into it knowing it was a space game with moba elements. It has those. I bought knowing it would become a competitive title. I bought knowing it would eventually transition into a f2p game.  What they're doing is completely underminining the posibility of a competitive and fair game. I will explain in more detail later.The introduction of the crew system has been the final straw for me. This system is one of the worst I've seen in a game? You got angry at tripwire for introducing crates into the game for cosmetic items? Well guess what? ECG incorporated a drop system with a 1% chance(https://www.fracturedspace.com/forums/index.php?p=/discussion/11409/drop-system-rates-for-individual-items/p1)of getting a crew member. I should point out that these crew members also alter stats. Yes, that's right. They alter and improve certain stats (3 per crew and you have 5 crew) in a positive manner (absolutely no negatives). This is in a random drop every 2 games for a max of 3 drops a day. That link contains more information. You can purchase a better chance at obtaining crew in the store for roughly 100,000 credits which is about 5 games if you do incredibly well. Or you could spend platinum, the premium currency of Fractured Space.The other aspects of the store: Skins. Here are the prices for platinum and the prices for skins in the store. I'm going to use 'P' to stand for Platinum as it's their currency.1000P - $54400P - $2011500P - $5025000 - $100Regular skin (color change, like a paint job) - 990PLegendary skin (new jump animation, model, and weapon effects. Doesn't improve stats) - 2990PPremium ship (new model, animations, weapon effects, and a 10% xp and credit increase) - 5990PCredit Booster (doubles credits earned at end of a match) - 60PXP booster (doubled xp earned at end of a match) - 120PDrop ships (the better way to get those stat altering crew members) - 345P for one or 135,000 credits.You can read the following forum posts for more information regarding the rest of the crew system. I'm not going to cover that here.https://www.fracturedspace.com/forums/index.php?p=/discussion/11409/drop-system-rates-for-individual-items#latesthttps://www.fracturedspace.com/forums/index.php?p=/discussion/11413/so-how-does-this-new-crew-acquisition-work#latesthttps://www.fracturedspace.com/fractured-space-drop-system-overview/GameplayIt's actually rather enjoyable to a degree. There's going to be 33 ships on transition to the f2p model. Almost all of them are ingame. All of them have unique looks. All of the models are incredibly well detailed.Games take roughly 30 minutes to complete and are objective based rather than TDM. It's split into 5 sectors with 2 bases, 1 central sector that can be captured to provide a team buff, and 2 lanes on the sides where you'll do most of your combat. Each of those side lanes has 3 mining stations which provide resources. As you gather resources (it's an automatic process) you'll level up and gain flat stat increases across your ship. Gamma (the middle sector) comes online once every several minutes and serves as a way to break of the pace of the game. The team that wins gamma and captures it gains a buff that allows them to push down the lane and help capture the enemy home base.It plays like a submarine game so you don't have 6-dof and you will never have 6-dof so don't ♥♥♥♥ing ask.Balance between the ships is a joke. There are a few ships that are just better than others. While you're thinking it might be because they're higher on the tech tree I'll say that's wrong. Higher on the tree means more specialized and harder to play, not better. Regardless there are better ships and that's unfortunate. They have failed to balance these out as they are were introduced rather letting them sit in a broken state sometimes for months.Have I mentioned the grind? For a competitive game there should be no grind. You need to grind out ships that act as counters to others. Makes sense right? Those are often further down the tech tree so it requires even more time to unlock the ships prior to give you access.ConclusionFrankly the game had potential. I say had because the last few updates have really been nothing but grind increases. There have been little improvements to the core gameplay experience and it really shows. The introduction of a RNG progressions system has just about done it for me and that's why I'm writing this review in hopes that you'll take a second look at this game before buying or spending your money.Right now it's a grind fest and full of bugs that were reported multiple times. 4 months ago I would've recommended it without a second thought. I can't recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun competitive experience with capital ships."

Back when the game was first released everyone was complaining about the Assassin class with plasma cannons being OP because it could almost destroy a flagship in a single run, but people didn't realize that it was really hard to move across the entire map with the cloak on, and then back away once the cloak was gone and you were taking hits.But now they have a 'sniper' type ship that fires a steady beam and rips through any ships health in seconds. And ontop of that, the weapon has almost no cooldown period and stupid insane range. So basically you can hit someone from across the map and never have to really move...There are a lot of balance issues that need to be worked out with the ships and their respective loadsout/damages/speeds/etc. Once those are done I have no doubt that the game will be as fun as it used to be, but until then I won't recommend the game to anyone.

With that said, I would honestly like to see the control system redone. In space, there is no down and no up. The ships in game are strictly anchored to the X,Y, and Z planes with no ability to move otherwise. A good example of this is the game Star Conflict. Instead of playing chase-me-around-the-capture-point, Star Conflict allows players to take cover behind physical structures and move without restriction in any direction and greatly increases maneuvering abilities. Another game which can also exemplify this is Air Brawl. (keep in mind both of the forementioned games are still in alpha and beta stages, and can be downloaded and played for free.)Again, I understand the game is still in early alpha, and I realize that new features can and will be emplimented, but the control format and limitations are my biggest concerns. At this point, I wouldn't really reccommend the game to anyone with a lot of experience in dynamic motion games. I have faith that it can improve."

It's awful, it's just awful to say the very least. It doesn't run at all. Combat ♥♥♥♥s the fps, usually drops to around 5 when I ""play''. The movement is clumsy and slow, and it doesn't feel satisfying. I believe there's some teamplay involved but more in a sense that multiple units>few units. No actual real time supporting one another(which is usually an aspect of moba games).All by all, I can't réally tell if this game is potent. Seeing the effort put into it i'd say yes, but seeing how HORRIBLY optimzied it is it almost looks like they aren't even trying. This is literally the worst optimized game I ever played.

Everything about capitol ship battling is just awesome, and the dev-team did a great job in creating a vast array of ships to choose from that made gameplay interesting and not boring. The capture the flag, mixed with teamwork, and PvP ship to ship always kept me coming back; and as a founder I was proud to have helped monetarily.But, unfortunately, that's where the pros end...With the last reset (final?) I lost everything I'd acquired. Now to diehard gamers that's a given. There's an Alpha then a Beta, and that's that - what's the big deal? Well, the big deal for me is I can't grind through the game again to reacquire  what I already painstakingly put time into getting. I don't have the 100+ hours to put into this game so I'd be on an even footing again, and that's not right in my book. Don't punish the casual player, and especially not someone who paid for the original access - helping this game develop more. I'd be fine if my experience and money was set to zero, I'd totally have no problem with that. But taking every single ship I EARNED, every upgrade I EARNED, and resetting it... that's just unacceptable. Also, with the reset the game has become completely unplayable. There's no longer a server screen to select matches from, now it's just your name, some slots, and the ""to join"" button. Then the waiting, and waiting, and waiting. Everytime! I've waited for ten minutes once, and nothing, yet there are 144 people in game - how's that work? And on the odd chance I did connect to a game/server I'd never get to the actual match; just a countdown and noises of being at the starting portal.It's been a couple of months since the reset and I have yet to join a match, and it's infuriating to have a computer that works properly, and a fine internet connection, but a game that's totally gone to pot. And it's ashame it has, because it was my go-to for the good part of a year.But now I know not to buy a game that's in Alpha, unless I'm willing to grind everytime it's reset.

Here's why.Back around may 13th, the game looked barebones, and it appeared the devs were gonna cash out and let this game die.But oh was I wrong.The devs came back full force, and implemented a new combat system, and pulled the game out of early access.Here are some of the pro's and con'sPros:Teamwork is AWESOME in this game, and its VERY fun to play with friendsIts no longer impossible to progress in terms of cash, and the early funders (me included) of the game have gotten small thank you packs from the developers!They have balanced the newer assault ships VERY well, instead of leaving them OP as ♥♥♥♥.They added a Solo/Co-Op gamemode!Cons:Wether you think this is a Con or not, the game DID become free-to-play, and this upset A LOT of the community, as the game costed about $20 when people got it.Bugs are frequent in the new system for getting into games, and its very annoyingFighters seem to be over armored, and under armed. They deal VERY little damage, and have little purpose other than shooting down bombers.Overall, I think this is a good game. I bought it for about $30, and now that its Free-To-Play, Its a HELL of a bargain.Combat: 9/10Menu/Interface: 6/10 (Old interface was MUCH better)Graphics: 8/10 (Great, but not optimized very well."

They never stop trying to add to the game for all of the players and they keep balancing the game to be a great experience every time. I am most impressed with their dedication, constant patches, and updates that aim to achieve a bigger and better game. It's amazing how much they do really. Only Empyrion's devs are on their level as far I have seen in my library.The gameplay is what I would say is tanks in space which is good considering you are flying capital class vessels. It's slow and tactical but when you meet, it's a brawl that will give you a serious adrenaline rush. I really wanted to try out the PVE they added but more players need to play this game and support it because it is a great game that deserves it. I seriously encourage any of you space junkie gamers out there to give this game a chance. You won't regret it when you finally queue up. The game is great, it just needs more players to really reach its full potential."

Its an AMD build so not sure why my computer would need anything by intel. Anyone know how to disable the extenstion? Maybe a settings reset would help but ive reinstalled several times with no difference in the result...(Edit) fixed the issue and gotta say its an interesting twist to classical moba games.

But the new MMR system also deluted the players MMR to a level where it´s just not funny anymore. You get players with up to 1.4k MMR that don´t even get the basic principle´s of the game, and that makes you wonder how such players can get so high MMR, when its currently capped at 2k.....As a High MMR playing Vet, you will have to carry. Alot. But factor in that your 1k+ MMR teammates act like they just finished the tutorial, well.....let´s just say the frustration grew on me. I wont touch this game until there is a decent MMR system that is working correctly. And that includes protection for the lower players, as well as the higher players (preventing them to be teamed up with low skill players and constantly having to carry till their back´s break).Review in June:This game is addictive and fun. It´s a Space ship team orientated ""moba-ish"" game, that requires tactics, thinking ahead, as well as reflexes and good aim.It does have it´s downsides, as it´s currently in Aplha stage. So expect a few bugs now and then, and a matchmaking system that isn´t the best at the moment (just lacks the playerbase for the most part).The community is pretty good, and the devs do listen to feedback. Of course not everything the playerbase wants, will be implemented or changed, but show me a game where that is the case ;)I can only recommend this title, as it will only get better and better."

I love that there are more players now, it was just what the game needed. But even among free-to-play grinders this game is a little on the tedious side. I'm talking long play sessions, many games just to unlock a single ship, then repeat to a lesser extent to unlock each of the many modules for each ship. But I thought I wouldn't have to worry about this. I was a founder! I paid money to support the game, then I put in the time to unlock all the ships and many of the modules back in early access. I thought ""man I can't wait to play this game with all the work I've put in with a new big player base.""Then I log back in after months away to find my progress wiped. What the FUQK? Just to be clear, the later ships don't really confer an advantage, really just a different play style. So why then did the developers insist on resetting progress? Because they don't care about rewarding loyalty or rewarding devotion or rewarding people who contributed money in the past. All they care about is how much more money they can get out of the players in the future.$$$Be sure to go purchase the Armada DLC that unlocks all the ships for 40 friggin bucks (when its on sale)!!!!!!!!!$$$"

Maybe they thought the maps back then were too big and slow paced but if they wanted to make the maps smaller to make the game feel faster - downscaling it to the current level is way too overkill.Nonetheless I still love this game tbh. And it's still fun despite the smaller maps. The larger maps were funner though.But basically:Old FS with larger maps - 9/10Current - 6.5/10
