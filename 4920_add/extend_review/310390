Great and simple mechanics, Wonderful random scenario Generator. The best and most elegant production system for this type of wargame. The UI is a little outdated but the depth of strategy is enough to overlook it. At first the some the interface can be annoying and confusing but after a while you begin to understand why it is designed that way and it actually makes for a much more flexible gameplay. I put hours in on this game before the steam release and i just hope this release opens up more players and mods!!!!"

Supplies for units. ore for production of various units you can use in divisions. oil for motorized units, carefull tho once you run out of oil your war machine stops to a grinding halt, tanks and motorized units can barely move, any aircraft is grounded.It has a small learning curve but once you know what every button does its fairly easy. It also has a random map generator with quite alot of settings. you can even have a civilization alike game. you start with 1 city and HQ with a few unitsCities and factories produce units, wich you can mix and match in self cuztomized divisions. Different terrains with different stats. And thats not even all of it, It would be too many to name.However all this fun stuff comes pared with a rather funky outdated UI, Alot of time consuming gameplay and tons of micromanagement.Overall a 8/10 - would run out of oil during an operation again."

The way the AI plays you'd assume it was cheating, but it isn't. Instead, the AI is exploiting you as much as it can; taking advantage of obvious mistakes. Unlike many other games in the genre, the AI is *actually* trying to outsmart you, outflank you, out-produce you, and generally stomp all over you (within reason, depending on the difficulty settings).Also... As others have pointed out, the user interface *is clunky*, but honestly it is a lot of fun regardless once you get the hang of the keyboard shortcut schema."

The editor is also ingame, and on the main menu!Custom ScenariosThere are base scenarios to choose from, but many of them are the classic version of the game, Advanced Tactics, however some have the rules and SFT's of Advanced Tactics Gold. The scenario bank though, atVRdesighns.net, allows much more ability to choose a specific scenario of your choice, also there are mods that change the graphics, the Units, and the timeline of the gameNew Dawn-New Dawn allows much more in the singleplayer and multiplayer experience. Generals adds a personilization feel of the game, with the ability to change the name of them and name them Bob, for example. The Tables of Orginization and Equipment (TOE) system allows much less micro and allows you to have a specific template for units. The SFT designer, in New Dawn allows you to make Armor/Armour of your own.Flaws-Of course, every game has its flaws.Interface is crowded (Hardcore Strategy fans will most likely deal with that)Bad AI- The AI can't even handle supply well!Bad Graphics- of course, the game has outdated graphics, but cut it some slack, the most recent graphics update was in 2011 when ATG came out! Compare the graphics to HOI3 if you want a somewhat realistic graphics comparisonBad tutorial- The game lacks an ingame tutorial, of course DasTactic, and the strategy guide will help a lot with that.Overall, the game is very good, after the begining stages of learning, you will like this game, and with a helpful community on MatrixGames forums, and the Editor and scenarios, this game is really great"

I was searching for something like this for a very long time, a wargame that I can wrap my head around (100+ pages of manual might look daunting for someone not used to tabletop wargames, but trust me, this is on the light side) with a random map generator! That plus many parameters for random generator and many premade scenarios can get you an unlimited replayability and incredible variety: want to play WWII scenario? You can! Want to have almost 4x stile game with exploration and research (minus diplomacy)? You can! Want a huge war with thousands of units or a small cousy war? It is up to you to choose. AI is challenging enough, and that is not granted in contemporary strategy games. And there even is a RPG element where your officers gain levels and feats. It is a well designed and elegant game that will make you brain burn some sugar.Now if only someone would make a Space Opera scenario to work with AI, that would be the only strategy game I need!"

I played through a few random matches before giving the multiplayer a shot, now that is something. You can sit there and play a scenario of just about whatever you can create with a friend and it will be the most grueling strategic battling ever. With all of the appropriate and expected infantry casualties and supply interdiction runs. A glorious depth to the gameplay and a very entertaining random skirmish mode."

The side that has a developed railway supplying and reinforcing their troops have a serious edge- and cutting off the enemy's supply corridor is the only way to ensure victory.The 'New Dawn' update added the Table of Equipment and Organization which allows you to create self-reinforcing units that are composed exactly the way you want them, which cuts down on micro-management without taking away control- making this one of my favourite strategy games."

GET THIS GAME.This game's gimmick is that it sets up random map procedurally generated map, per your specifications.  You want 1 AI or 11?  You want to play allied with AI, teams, or free for all?Think of this game as RTS that is turnbased.Especially with ""1 city start"" (my favorite), you start owning 1 city/base (cities are production centers) and have to build up units to explore the map, take over other cities and land, and meanwhile tech up and build up your army to be ready for the AI which is doing the same thing.I am a grognard, I immediately disliked the idea of this game as I usually play historical WW2 games, monsters like War in the East by Gary Grigsby, and I can tell you that I WAS WRONG about this gem.  This game is awesome!  And the procedurally generated maps work very well, also!Highly, highly recommended.I might even write a steam guide to help new players in.This game is SUPER CHEAP - just get it if you're interested at all in board wargaming with a VERY GOOD AI.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.PSThere are a few scenarios included in the game, build by people/fans, on 1941 WW2 Barbarossa campaign.

With two different play styles, either the New Dawn settings with more diversity and more points to control or the original style. Singleplayer or multiplayer. However multiplayer is not server based, you have to send the game file one way or another to the other player. With the level editor there's great replayability. Overall I would say this game is superbly fun and the only downsides is playing with others and waiting for the game to get back to you."
,Recommended,310390,21449943,"Posted: 25 February, 2016",all,Mr.,"Includes tutorial files and detailed scenarios of various conflicts from WWII. This review is somewhat downvoted because previously it was a very short review. AT:G is like Sid Meier's Civilization V for wargamers because this game features endless replayability, random map generator, and a level editor. You can create your own scenarios as well. The multiplayer is designed for PBEM (Play-by-E-mail), however, this is hardly a problem thanks to Google Drive (Thanks Google !)Gameplay-wise, AT:G is a semi-realistic World War II simulator in that resource stockpiles and unit types are accounted for. Not to mention, you can craft every unit into divisions and HQs, which is tedious but fun and flexible. Some people complain about the UI but if it were designed any other way managing every division would be difficult. For example, the UI allows you to maximize the control over the movement of each and every unit. You even have to use the UI to move your units, you don't click on a division and right click to move in the traditional sense of PC strategy games. You click on the division, then the move button on the UI, and then prompt where you want the unit to move. It may be meticulous at first, but the game is a lot deeper than speed play.What I love about this game is the fact you can play nations based on WWII on a personalized, random generated, map of varying size and quality. You'll fight for control of enemy cities and capitals to further your cause to victory, facing stockpile and supply issues along the way.I highly recommend this game, try to look past the simple graphics and notice there is no other gameplay offered in any other game besides Advanced Tactics: Gold Edition."

Probably fun if you have the time to study up on the manual. The mechanics are so damn opaque and non-intuitive that I had to look up how to launch an attack. Once I researched all the basics, I got a game started and was (seemingly) doing well. Then all my units started to be mysteriously sapped. No warning. No battle. Just, strength going away every turn.Enemy attacks? Nope.Attrition? It was in my own territory.Out of supply? After spending quite a while figuring out how to check supply levels, I determined that my supply was fine.That's right about where I threw in the towel. I'm sure there is a rational explaination for the mechanic. I just don't have the time to figure out what it is.I like games like this, but I don't have time to throw into the undergrad prereq course to play.

It has random generated maps and you can edit a random map before the game starts, creating small land bridges etc. The supply system is fun and realistic, ...the formation never dies!There is also a HQ system; Generals gain experience and keep your troops supplied and increase their effectiveness. Combat is well thought-out, well defended/entrenched hexes cannot be broken by simply spamming units and raiding them over and again, and (with default rules) you cannot build one massive invincible unit; rather you have to have the right combined arms, the right placement and the right strategy.I learned the game quite quickly, from 'dastactic' on youtube and the 20 page strategy guide.I like it a lot."

The main goal of this review is to help those who are on the fence while the sale is on. I'm telling you, if you are a strategist you will love this gameA Few Warnings-Bit of a steep learning curve-There is no faction picker. The game is randomized and so is the factions-Graphics and Interface will take some getting used to. I am not one to complain about graphics, but here is a prime example of when better graphics would help understand what's going on. Once I read the tutorial, the graphics didn't bother me as much-Tutorial is not built-in, you load a scenario and read a guide to that scenario on a website.The Amazing Stuff+The type of complex I've been looking for. Spamming gets you nowhere. You got to build sensible formations.+Awesome transport system. Trucks, Horses, Trains+Arty, Planes, Infrantry, Supply etc....everything in war is in this game+Random map generator. Keeps the game going with different options and rule sets.+All units have a specific purpose. It's not like Hearts of Iron where the units are broken down into Soft/Hard attack and organization. Every unit has its role in a formationStuff I don't know yetSince I only have a few hours into the game, this is the section I will update as I go. This is so you can research further if you are curious about something I can't cover.?How navy works?Installing custom scenarios and mods?Multiplayer (I have no friends that have this game to test it with)?Research.

,Recommended,310390,22189384,"Posted: 1 April, 2016",all,Gamerofthegame,"Good news; this game is the Advanced Wars of grognard, detailed hex based games. It's not just a rehash of WW2 over and over, the base game actually gives way to a random, balanced environment each time, with map generation settings for your flavor. And this is good! The game itself is actively developed and extremely moddable, pretty much being a sandbox of possible relatively easily accessible, hex-based nitty gritty strategey. And that's good! Some reviews will probably mention a lot of nit picking details, like having to hand make your units - those are old reviews, with development allowing for ""templates"" of units you can set, which those units automatically requesting reinforcements to meet those templates instead of YOU doing it. Unit interaction makes sense, almost all details you can understand and go ""Yeah, alright, I get this.""Now the bad. For one, the AI is kind of a miserable experience, this is very much a multiplayer game. You're gonna want friends to play with or a community to join. It's also probably going to be play be email, which is a pretty slow going time. The documentation of the game is pretty bad, with unit descriptions being typo riddled, for one, and tutorials and other manual-likes being pretty shoddy. True, once you understand how to do something it's very easy to do it and to get the information needed quickly, but to actually get to that point you're probably going to need out of game help. And honestly? At a price tag of thirty bucks that might be a bit high.Still, if you have people you can play it with and are interested in the whole niche genre, it makes for an outstanding entry point."

I was initially put off by the graphics but this game was on sale at the time so i thought -to hell with it i'll give it a go and im glad i did. Ok so the game isn't going to win any awards for it's looks but underneath it's exterior there lurks a very good strategy game with a huge amount of detail. As the player you don't just move your armies around the map conquering territory you also have to manage your production of raw materials and oil to fuel your war machine as well as your supply lines. Units can be equipped with trucks, trains, transport planes and even horses to make sure your armies stay mobile and that supplies keep flowing and engineers are needed to construct railways and factories to help in this endevour. You also have complete control over things like unit production, research and the size and composition of your armies as well as your command structure. As you play the game, things like terrain and weather come into effect which gets you really thinking about how to plan an attack - mechanized units will struggle to move through mountainous terrain, tanks will get bogged down in the mud after heavy rain or melting snow and planes are rendered ineffective by fog. Armies can get flanked, surrounded or cut off from supply and things like morale, unit experience, entrenchment and suppression all come into play when the results of battles are being calculated. The game features a random map generator which is able to produce enormous maps made up of literally thousands of hexes and allows the player complete customization over the type of world they wish to play on giving the game almost unlimited replayability. I think the best thing about the game is starting out with just one hq unit and finding later that you are commanding a vast army of ground, air and naval units and fighting a war against your opponent where all sorts of tactics come into play - bombing their cities to reduce production, attacking supply ships with submarines, carrying out air recon and interception etc. If i had to pick faults with the game i would say the graphics aren't very good, the ai puts up a fair challenge (for a beginner like me) but would probably be too easy for more experienced players, alot of micromanagement which isn't for everyone and lastly the price of these games are usually very high (due to them being a very niche genre i guess). I would recommend buying this game but try and get it on sale. Overall a very accessible game for players new to the genre not to difficult to learn but enough attention to detail to keep you thinking and interested, alot easier to play than say the 'Hearts of Iron' games but with less detail and features."

A hands-on, nitty gritty no hand holding strategy game. To be able to play it successfully I would recommend to read the PDF-manual (140 pages) at least once or, even better, several times. To learn by playing is probably doable but very, very frustrating. It took me roughly five minutes to figure out how to order an attack, since I didn't take the time to read the manual. The learning curve for the game is pretty much straight up.The game puts you in charge of everything. What to produce (supply, research or troops), where to produce it, how to distribute it, command over troops, creation of armies, where to attack, with whom and how. The list of what you have to manage is long and it's really easy to get lost by all the details you have to manage. Having its roots in the strategy boardgaming tradition I can see how a single turn easily can be upwards of 30 minutes in the larger scenarios.It's not pretty. Being a computer strategy board game it eschews fancy graphics, instead showing the typical square markers for your troops on a functional but quite drab map.These kind of games are really hard to rate. For a casual gamer, I can't recommend it but for a hardcore strategy fan it's really good (especially since this sub-group usually don't care about graphics at all).So, no score this time, but it's really not for everyone....﻿"

You can play everything from a basic infantry to capital ships.  Tons of scenerios (free to download) to play but the real gem is playing a random generated map.  One of the great aspects of the game is the concrete engine and how it handles supply.  To fight you need supply and bleed to death if you're forces are cut off.  Create your own divisions, rename them (if you want) and assign them to a HQ.  Heck you can even create your Div model and use that to create and supply new units.  To get a handle on this game and see how it plays check out YouTube as there are some great YouTubers that cover this game and it's mechanics in detail.The AI is actually pretty good in this game too.  It will use & exploit openings to turn your smile to a frown.  You can chose how bad or brutal the AI is in each game.Again the life of your forces are supply.  Unlike other games that simulate supply, this game will actually show how supply is reaching (or not) your troops to you can plan rather you need to hold the cross roads or build another one.  If you cut off and surround a powerful unit you can just sit back and let them bleed dry.  Unless they can mount air supply drops to that unit it will starve and become unless.  But then again if they use their cargo planes to resupply they'll have to fight through your air intercepters.  Use engineers to build roads or bridges across streams and rivers for better movement and supply.  Chose exactly use each of your cities produce and supply your HQs to wage war or to pepper up defense.  All your choice!Really the only downside to this game is it's clunky UI (feels like it's from the 90's) which could use a huge overhaul.  If they did that I'd probably buy it again just on that alone.  This game does have a bit of a learning curve but like I said watch some YouTubers on this game and the rest is up to you.Battle on!"

You have to register on their site to get mods.  Registration requires a serial number.2) For reasons outlined below, I have a major issue with Slitherine and Matrix with their anti-consumer behavior for games you purchase directly from their site:a) Matrix and Slitherine as companies do NOT honor a download policy when games are lost.   You can  reinstall on Steam but you are out of luck if you bought the game(s) through their site.  They require you to register, provide a receipt, and provide a serial number.  All of this is ofcourse is on the hard drive you lost.b) Matrix and Slitherine do not provide credible help support for issues with games.c) You can not get updates without joining the site as a member and providing a serial number.I stupidly purchase this game without realizing any of this and regret the purchase."

Even Hearts of iron 3, which is less hardcore, has a much deeper level of science management and unit composition detail."

Then game after game my overwhelming forces were routinely beaten by out of supply and woefully inferior enemy units. Some say they like the game…good for them…I say rubbish."

I also have a lot of patience to  figure out games that are poorly built and hard to play.  This is game is not worth it.  It looks and feels like a 20 year old game, but not a good 20 year old game."

I love the graphics and visual information, its basic but spot on.  however the UI is a bit lacking when you start out; intuitive it is not!  But the tutorials easily found in the steam discussions will soon get you finding your feet and it comes together.If you are prepared to be a little patient when starting, you will be rewarded.  I fear I will be losing alot of sleep to this game."

Funny thing is, it reminds me a lot of the classic UNIX Empire game (seewolfpackempire.com)which was awesome,  and very time consuming.This game definitely gets a thumbs up and I hope I'm up to the challenge of being able to play it successfully."
