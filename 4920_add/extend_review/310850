Only 1 or 2 weapons have anything to upgrade on right now.  The upgrade ""station"" seems in hap hazard location, i prefer the upgrade anytime instead of wondering when the next shine is.Pickups: (50% working, maybe)  Orbs from enemies do not actually fill your health back up, not sure if this is just GUI issue or if it is not impleneted as i randomly got health back.  Also, the coins/dragons blood locations were well thought out and not too bad to get to, but they were just after... a check point so you had to pick up each time. interesting GLITCH / oversight if you died and went back to the checkpoint you could pick up the item again and you will notice that you STILL have the number after you picked it up the first time and it just keeps adding.Checkpoints:  These are pretty well set, but thought i was going to be stuck in a few places just the way you have to try the options and fight the controls sometimes on (grappling hook / air glide) or chased by vines that you have to do 'dodge' dash all the way across the screen since running isn't fast enough."

Would you look at that.http://youtu.be/gmPwxocTZL0The main mechanics of the game are here, and the beatem up still specifically with the variety of weapons is fun. It feels like a 2D form of devil may cry (with the combo letter meter thrown in), but the combat can get really engaging and make s a good core game. Is the game perfect, heck no. There's a bunch of bugs, but that's the thing, it's still fun while playing it.The mixup of the early level introducing mechanics while playing is good, like running from fire or using them to your advantage is cool.And the price decrease for early access is appreciated, because it shows good faith on the developers as they seem that they want your feedback.I'm willing to support it, as the core game is fun."

As a fan of Ninja Gaiden, Devil May Cry and other combo based Hack and Slash styled games, I can say that I fully recommend this game. It's dark and beautiful.The game's gameplay is smooth. Each hit I land feeling satisfying. Dashing around and swiftly taking out each demon that stands before me. My combo meter rises to show that I have done a good job. Like poetry with a sword... orrrr some haiku crap like that...The graphics are stunning. The beautiful artwork and menacing demons make the game pleasing to look at. Combine the smooth gameplay and you have yourself some eye candy.The music fits the tones of each scene and fight. Very well done and it's something I'd listen to even on my free time. So good~There are a couple weird things with the game however. Very VERY few times so far, I've had a stutter, character was out of place when reloading a checkpoint and some audio cut out too early. Nothing major. The graphics options are bare bones. Resolution, Anti-Aliasing, V-Sync. The very simple stuff. No advanced graphics optons which can be weird for others with less powerful systems.Overall, This game is great. I love it so far and will play it a lot more."

Firstly, because it's awesome and, secondly, so they'll finish it. :DIt's early access right now, but the levels you get access to seem, for the most part, fairly complete.It's pretty much Onimusha 1 meets Mark of the Ninja, with less metroidvania than Mark of the Ninja. Gorgeous artwork, responsive controls, challenging encounters. It's looking to promise upward of 10+ levels with unlockable/obtainable weapons, skills, etc. It's a steal at $13 and you get a free copy to hook a friend up with [despite the lack of multiplayer] and the soundtrack - which, I'm guessing, is being released track-by-track as the levels are released - for purchasing the Contributer's pack, which is pretty awesome. :D"

I had in the mind that it was risky for me about the feelings I'd have about it and I was right. The trailer and design look great but the pleasure of gameplay is still far to be there while I can confirm its presence in a similar game that is Bloodrayne betrayal. I hope this game will continue to evolve in good improvement direction to become worth the promesses that this very stylish trailer's look gives.

Anything with Samurai... I'm in. No questions asked. At first I didn't recommend this game because of some bugs I found. One of the most annoying was this crackling noise that accompanied the whole game. But after a little tinkering aka reinstalling the game and verifying the game cache the problem seems to be fixed so if you have that problem that's what I would recommend doing.The levels are quite lengthy, you have to finish the level before quitting or you'll restart it, though which is nice seeing as there are only seven. The game itself runs very well and looks great. Combat is nice. tight and clean. Nice amount of moves/weapons to unlock. Basically a game that isn't over the top or complicated. Its just a solid game with a few bugs here and there. One of the main bugs has to be in the arena mode. I forget which one it is, I believe it has to do with getting a 100 hit combo but it loads so many enemies at once it crashes. Other than that though, it was 10.49 well spent.Also the Devs are very active in making the game as best as it can be. You'll see a comment from one below asking which sound card I used in an effort to fix the crackling and will also see many comments from them in the discussions. I take my hat off to Digital Furnace Games on that. That's not something you see a lot now. :HanzosShadow:"
,Not Recommended,310850,14306272,"Posted: 2 February, 2015",all,[OG] Tragedy15,"Onikira - Demon Killerlooks like a pretty cool game. That's because it is a cool game. However, that alone is not enough for me to recommend this game to anyone. Yes, it does look promising, and I'm looking forward to playing the final product, but as it stands, it is still very clearly in the very early stages of development. If you're looking for an addictive 2D action game, I'd suggest checking out eitherShankorStriderinstead. Now then, let's get on with my Pros and Cons of this game.TL;DR - Cons far outweigh the Pros. Highly suggest waiting on this purchase.ProsBeautiful ArtworkDecent SoundtrackFull Controller SupportSteam LeaderboardsConsMenu Has a Very Minimal Amount of Options. You can adjust the resolution, check fullscreen on/off, set anti-aliasing level, and that's pretty much all. Would be nice to at least have an option to adjust video quality, brightness, difficulty, V-Sync, and of course some advanced graphics and gameplay options as well. I also feel that button mapping would be extremely useful for a game such as this.Frequent Frame Drops. The game is nearly unplayable due to this. A major con thatneedsto be worked on. Greatly impacts gameplay and fluidity.Combat Feels Strange. I'm not sure what word to use here, but I always found myself checking my FPS during combat because of how jumpy everything is. Could use a lot of improvement to make it more fluid. I feel a large part of this problem is the animation for certain moves and abilities more so than the actual controls. Both could honestly use quite a fair bit of work though.Menu Glitches and Crashes. This is pretty self-explanatory. Jiro will sometimes glitch into an infinite fall after you return to the main menu from seemingly any point in a level. This will also cause the sound to start glitching and doing weird things such as making morse code out of random in-game sound effects.No Difficulty Levels. This isn't really much of a complaint for me as I don't usually change the difficulty in games from the default difficulty anyway, but I know there are definitely people who would like to have the ability to at least change between an Easy and Hard mode if nothing else. Also, I know this sort of goes back to the Lackluster Menu con, but I felt it deserved its own point.Not Always Easy to Find Your Character. This became an issue particularly in the boss fight. I found myself lost in the myriad of enemies numerous times throughout the fight and even died a couple times because of it. I would either blend into the background too much, or I would just get swarmed and not be able to distinguish myself from the enemies.No Button Remapping. Again, self-explanatory point that goes back to the Lackluster Menu. I played this with my DualShock 4, but even then the controls felt a bit off. You can never go wrong with including remapping in your game. Just make sure it isn't presets instead of full remapping.No MP or CO-OP. Not a big deal to me, but I know some people would be turned off by the lack of this feature."

If the game was half the price of what it's currently listed at(£10.59), then it might be worth it. The combat in this game is very clunky and slow so it takes away from the entire point in being a samurai. The enemies spawn in waves which gets very repetitive... it's not exactly a thrilling experience. One main issue for me that I can't get past is the on-screen text at the beginning of the game which is meant to explain the story after you start a new game; it changes to the next section of text way too fast and doesn't give you the option to skip to the next bit of text yourself due to it being a cut-scene rather than it using in-game mechanics, but they give you the option to skip text with the A button in-game so it really doesn't make any sense as to why they chose a cutscene over in-game options. Games will capture me straight away if they are actually good, but sadly this game doesn't because of the slow, clunky combat and repetitive nature. If you want a very good samurai/ninja game then buy 'Mark of the Ninja' as it won't disappoint. I expected way more from this game."

Amazingly, Steam still sells this abandonware and even puts it on sale.Original ReviewThis game looks amazing.  It even played amazing...at one point.  For me, ever since this game came out of Early Access, it just crashes.  Sometimes it crashes on a menu, sometimes at the level select, and then crashes randomly during gameplay.  Now, I can't even play the first level without it crashing and an error message of program has stopped working.  When I played during Early Access, I made it past the second level and decided to stop playing and come back when the game was finished since the devs were adding some enemies and tweaking the gameplay to make it more fluid and responsive.I installed the game when I heard it came out of Early Access and really wanted to play.  Well, I can't play because it crashes every time I load the game.  I've validated files, tweaked game settings, and did fresh installs of the game.  Nothing worked for me.  I posted on the pinned forum that was setup specifically to report errors and get support from the dev team.  Months have gone by and I have heard nothing from the devs except that they are ""busy porting the game to the Fuze Console"".  Apparently too busy to fix a broken game and essentially ignoring their customers.I really enjoyed this game back when I was able to play it.  The art style is great, the music and sound are amazing, and its a 2D side-scrolling beat'em up (a genre which I love).  If the game works for you, then enjoy it.  All I can say is save your money and buy something else.  Even if this game were offered at 90% off, it still would not be worth it due to the state at which the game is in.Edit: Notice how most of the positive reviews are from Early Access.

I had it installed since the 6th of June and since then I already needed to start a new game twice, because the saved-game would crash over and over again. Besides that it should have stated in the store that the minimum requirements are a controller. Because you can't actually play it that well with Keyboard. And adjusting things in the menu is a pain in the you-know-what. Besides that it's hard to get passed the first level. A tutorial level would be nice. Yaiba Ninja Gaiden Z is far better ! (And in semi-3D).The style/idear is good tough.P.S.: 2nd refund from my Summer Sale 2016 buying. (The first one being This War of Mine)."

It is true, I didn't give it much time for it to develop, but I couldn't help but notice some design attributes to this game that really set me off.  First, there is no health potion in the first level, and it is understood for the most part, considering it is your first time playing the game, to die, and then respawn with full health at a check point.  I was concerned this would be the way things are done.  Second, I found the restricted area of fighting to be quite annoying.  And I get that maybe the ideal distance to fight, then I would argue put less stuff on the map at the same time.  I get it that the game is trying to be more challenging, and this comes to my other point, it wasn't challenging, it was annoying.  It wasn't fun.  There are these head guys that float in the air while you fight on the ground, and it just takes away from the experience.  I would rather fight without some head thing dangling above my head forcing me to dash and sometimes take damage, even if that means it is easier.  Third, on the first boss, these head things use a red laser to tell you the trajectory that they are going to fire.  Well, the background is a fire, and you can't really see where they are going to fire.  This I think is poor design, and they should of had that laser be blue or something.I also understand that it is the beginning of the game, and maybe there is a level up system, but the combos were insanely easy to pull off.  I feel like what would of been a better alternative, is get rid of the heads, and force people to kill opponents quicker by using the combos given to the player at that time.Not to mention the environment progression, albeit it is the first level, is just left to right.  There's no secrets, no multiple levels, annoying as hell fighting, and no health potions, it just isn't a game for me.  Oh yeah, insanely easy combos.  Usually what games do if they have easy combos, is they introduce a fatality sequence.  This wasn't presented to me when I played it.I make quick decisions when it comes to my game selection, simply because there are so many games to play."

I never get problem like this before on any other games with my controller (X1 pad). And the bad point is sometime i have to replay latest mission far from last get crash problem.The slow motion everytime i repel enemy's bullet with my weapon is useless and very annoying. So fix this asap, dev! Not recommend until dev fix this problem.----------------2D version of Devil May Cry or Onimusa.  The graphic look colorfull and very good for 2D with red colour so dominan some mission.Another good point : You can upgrade your weapon technique, shoot bazoka, no loading time when character died (only black screen for 1s), and fight Huge Bosses...so much fun.This is the game that can bring back my mood after got frustated some hardest achievement (so annoying) on several games."

Max Fightmaster,"This is the gaming equivalent of a sophist argument, it looks cool, and the controls feel good at first, but the flaws are evident when examined under a watchful eyeWell, some flaws are evident even if you aren't a beat em up enthusiast like i am, there are many bugs that have been around since day one, and persist to this day after various patches, for example, your character randomly dashes after certain attacks even if you don't input a dashI've seen some other negative reviews that talk about those issues, but miss(and even praise!) the biggest one, that is in fact the core of the game, the combatTLDR-it's a bad copy of DmC, the Ninja Theory one, the shakespearean, redheaded stepson of the familyThere are many attacks that were blatantly ripped off Dmc:DmC, the Scythe air to ground launcher makes an appearance, the Scythe's ground spinning launcher(i think it was called Shredder or something) also makes an appearance, the grappling hook is also thereAnd these aren't even well executed, the Shredder launcher can be held to do some extra hits, but the first hit launches the enemy higher than the additional hits, so you have to until the enemy falls, which is really annoyingWhich ties into another of the game's problems, there is little move diversity, there are 2 attack buttons, 4 weapons, and 2 sets of moves(ground and air), that's around 20 moves in total, since there aren't many command moves, that's not bad in itself, but the game makes very bad use of its movesetThere are about 4 hit effects, simple stagger, Upward launches, Downward launches, and horizontal launches, so a lot of moves cover the same usesAll weapons have a simple attack chain(on the air too), and a ground launcher, as far as i've noticed, both of these moves do the same thing with each weapon, the attack chain sends the enemy flying on a 45 degree angle, and the launcher sends them straight upThis raises several questions, why aren't there simply command moves, like up +attack, down + attack, etc, this way, the game wouldn't waste a button on a launcher, and that button could be used for different movesWhat is the point of weapon switching?, if the 4 weapons dont do different thingsIf the weapon switch is so quick, why don't the other moves cover options the sword doesn't already cover?I could go on, but just trust me when i say this game is badly designed"

I guess devs love DMC5 but, I think they should love DMC3. If these games are easy and simple, there is no point in playing.Old Review(Which is still valid):It's pretty much 2D DMC 5. Controls are same, you start with katana and fight like you always do, as you progress in level 1, you get 3 more weapons, I don't know why you get them so quickly though, maybe for testing purposes.Weapons are very similar to DMC's, like pressing LT to choose light but fast weapon like Aquila, there is even spining launch move, press RT for long weapon similar to Osiris, you can even pull enemies below when you're mid-air, and LT+RT at once for very heavy powerful big mace very similar to Arbiter.No music btw, I don't know why, and sounds effects are lacking too, I don't feel like I'm slaughtering bunch of poor creatures.No health bar, no HUD. I couldn't finish the first lvl though, but this game doesn't look like it's gonna show something new, it's just repeats the past."
