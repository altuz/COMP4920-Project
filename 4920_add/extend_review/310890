I tried to power through  it, but the further i got into the game, the buggier it became.This is not a finished product, DO NOT BUY IT UNTIL IT IS!!!27/08/15 EDIT: This review was placed a few hours after release. There have been several patches since, and the developers seemed genuinelly interested in cleaning up the day 1 mess. While i have not played the game since and can't attest to it being fixed, i suggest you check more recent reviews before you take this one to heart.I'll leave this review up -a red mark for a rushed released if you will- but do check more recent ones for confirmation on the current state of the game."

This led to widespread performance and reliability enhancements as the code’s dependence on the servers and the need to be ready for drop-in/drop-out multiplayer at any moment was removed. The improvements outlined below are just some of the ways the game has been made better by the removal of Co-op. ""So over a year after the games release the ""dev"" team decides to REMOVE the main feature of this game. Instead of actually fixing bugs and issues with coop, they decided to remove it.This is blatant false advertising as the product was sold with this as a listed feature. At the time of this post, this feature is STILL listed on the steam page.I will NEVER support these devs again, and neither should you."
,Not Recommended,310890,17173350,"Posted: 22 July, 2015",all,Hippyshake,"[TL;DR at last paragraph]I've supported and defended this game for quite a while now. I tried to accentuate the positive in my original review, but I have to change my rating to Not Recommended.DEADLine (in which, you control a 4-man squad fighting off hordes of zombies) is not a great game, but it's not a bad one either. The problem, though, is that I know I would have liked it more had it not been prefaced with the B&C title. Because of that title, instead of treating it as its own experience, I resent it for setting me up with certain expectations and then failing to deliver on any of them. Consider the following basic game play elements of both games:B&C: Players can select a path for each squad member, allowing them to set their viewing direction at the end point.DL: Implemented.B&C: Players can adjust their view at any point along the path chosen, allowing them to fire behind them and to the sides as they move.DL: Not implemented (although you can pause the game and change direction, but this isnotthe same thing).B&C: Players assign squad members to multiple doors, breaching with a variety of methods.DL: Doors are rarely used (and so far, I've only come across single entrances); method of breaching the few you'll find isn't really important.B&C: Players are visibly timed in each area, allowing them to set target times.DL: Not implemented.B&C: Players earn stars and coins for clearing areas within a specific number of turns, making actions used in each turn important.DL: Stars are not implemented; action can be frozen tosimulateturn-based play, but it's not vital, and not important.B&C: Stars unlock new weapons and gear; players use earned coins to purchase equipment.DL: Stars are not implemented. Players use randomly dropped (not earned) ""scrap"" for upgrades, and finds the rest in chests (à la Diablo.)B&C: Gear and squad members areextremelycustomizable; everything from the trigger used (weapons) to reaction time (stats), to perks (skills) can be tweaked.DL: Weapons can have up to three, swappable, ""attachments""; members each have a basic skill tree (à la Diablo). Individual stats can no longer be customized.B&C: Five levels of difficulty; areas can be replayed to try new tactics at any time, keeping any upgrades.DL: One difficulty, areas can't be replayed (unless you save at the start of each one, but then you'll lose your upgrades).B&C: Three different modes of play (""Terrorist Hunt,"" ""Bomb Defusal,"" and ""Escape Plan"").DL: Two ""Challenge Modes"" (one competing with other players) and the Campaign, which has typical RPG-styled quests (à la Diablo).Multiplayer has been added.EDIT 11/18/16 - Multiplayer has been removed from the game.[TL;DR] Only basic movement is the same;everything elseabout the game has changed. After playing for several hours now, I'm still not quite sure what DEADLine is (I think ""Diabloesque sorta-kinda-RTS"" comes closest, although it's also very similar to X-Com). However, I know what it isn't: It isn't a Breach & Clear game. Those expecting anything similar to the original game will likely feel confused and disappointed so, for this reason, I have to change my rating to Not Recommended."

It was for the honor of original Breach & Clear.What I liked in B&C: Deadline:+ For some reason I spent 14 hours with this.Whad I did not like:- There is no real need for tactics, this is just RTS.- And not very good RTS.- Lots of wandering around, in the un-inspired maps.- All UI controls are made with console conventions. Navigating in menus with PC is a mess.- Sometimes the control written on screen help is not the actual control to use.- Sometimes the squad follows your commands. Sometimes they just follow you. There are some controls for that, but either they are unintuitive or they just don't work.Overall, this game lacks finalization and inspiration."

They could've done something interesting here, like cast you as the CDC or a similar biological disaster unit. They coud've kept it close quarters, putting a strong empthasis on sight lines and room to react against fast moving lethal enemies. Where you could lose a character in an instant, where every death results in another enemy. Kind of like Space Hulk.Instead, they just went ahead and made Breach & Clear, but real time, in big outdoor maps, replacing lethal human enemies with slow moving cardboard targets and tasking you to do fetch quests for bland NPC's.Zombies. Literally the most cliche, worn-out, unoriginal theme available, and it has been for some years now. They didn't even spice it up, it's just generic zombies here.I only played two hours of Deadline, because that's all I could stomach. I tried to make the most of the strategy elements on offer, but honestly the only viable strategy was to form a firing line and slowly retreat. Zombies don't use cover or flank, so why bother doing anything fancy? Just stand and shoot forward. Oh, and if you have a shotgun guy, get used to him wasting ammo as shotguns have a range of about two feet apparently. Even human enemies weren't interesting to fight.It's.. astounding. I'm struggling to find ways to explain it other than just.. abysmal. Where did this come from? Did all of the original designers leave? Did they let the intern design the game?I usually try to be more objective and factual in my reviews but Deadline really just wound me up. They didn't just make one mis-step here, they made every mis-step at once.Another interesting title bent out of shape and plunged into the creative abyss that is ""zombie apocalypse""."

It's a top-down shooter that you can toggle between ""twin stick"" mode and tactical pause based mode. In twin stick mode your teammates follow you around and shoot on their own(you can freely control any team member at any time, and the rest will follow). Once you switch to tactical mode, you are able to give movement and shooting orders to each teammate individually.There are six classes with skill trees to move through. You get to make and customize your own 4 man team(choose appearance and rename team members). All the gear is changeable and upgradable. Slots are: Head, Body, Clothing, Primary, and secondary weapon. All inventory items and ammo are shared with the whole group at all times. So if you have 4 grenades, any of the members can access the grenades and throw them at any time(but some classes are better with them).The beginning of the campaign is a tutorial, and the beginning of the first mission is on rails for about 20 min, then the game opens up to being fairly free roam with objectives to choose from. Along with the zombies, there are humans with guns to fight against, which keeps the tactical feel of a Breach & Clear type game. You breach, suppress, and flank while using items and skills to overcome your opponents.Its RPG elements come with the classes, levels and gear management. Collect, switch out, and upgrade your armor and weapons.If this is the type of game you enjoy, then you should love this isometric tactical shooter/zombie survival game(it's not a survival game, but something like that on this engine would be super cool).There are a few kinks that need to be worked out. rebinding controls is convoluted(you can't unbind keys) and sometimes you can see enemys spawn in front of you, but overall I love the feel of the game.Oh, and it's co-op. Why is it that so many games in this age of extreme high speed internet can't add such a simple concept into their games? Especially when they already have multiplayer built in... Looking at you XCOM."

At first I was sceptical about this hybrid Tactical/RTS controlls and how it would work in a zombie game. Mark my words it WORKS and is super fun. Play it like an arcade game or be tactical. Believe me, being tactical will save your life many times.About game:You are playing in open world (city) where you will explore and search for weapon, ammo and medic crates. You will encounter zombies walking the streets that will do whatever they can to kill you. You will uncover fast travel locations that you can use later for traveling to specific locations. Me myself rarely use the traveling stations because I have so much fun killing the zombies and collecting scrap on my way to the npc missions.You will meet people ingame that will give you missions. After beating the missions you will earn exp to level up your soldiers. You get exp for killing on the streets but the big boost comes from the missions. Some missions also give rewards such as scrap or weapons.Gameplay:Pressing SPACE will let you go into tactical mode. You can easier cordinate your attack with all characters invidually. Example: Soldier1 cover our rear, Soldier2 cover left flank, Soldier3 cover right flank and Soldier4 cover front assault. And when pressing space you can move timeframe forward slowly so you can see how it works out and change tactics when needed.Weapons and special moves:Weapons ingame will have status effects common and rare. So if you are familiar with RPG games you will understand and enjoy this as well. All your soldiers have a special move wich they can use in battle so when you are choosing your squad, think forward what will you benefit from having in battles. You can customize all your soldiers to your liking. Even give name to your upgraded weapons lol.Scrap and Crafting:To upgrade your armor, equipment and guns you must craft them in safehouses, this will need scrap wich can be found in loot cheests out in the city. You will also get scrap by killing zombies and soldiers.Zombies is a blast to kill and there are alot of variations of them as well. Gfx of the zombies are well made.GFx 8,5-10SFx 7,0-10Gameplay 10-10 (Never had this much fun in a zombie game)Story 6,0-10 (Dont let this fool you.)I recommend this game. I havent had any issues with the game and the Devs keep patches comming so this game is still supported."

In the wake of a zombie infection you control a four man military team against masses of zombies and other survivors trying to achieve your mission. You can do this by issuing orders to you team and micromanaging their every move or taking control of one and having the rest follow. You can swap between these seamlessly as the situation dictates and this system works nicely in the game, allowing it to keep a good pace. The game includes a character levelling system, varied equipment, and a difficulty that scales nicely as the game progresses.I enjoy playing this game. I enjoy playing this game A LOT.But it is painfully bugged, and feels unfinished. There are parts of it that are poliished to perfection and I get the feeling these were the parts that the Developers found interesting and enjoyed working on. The rest is in need of a lot of work.Positives:A well thought out character and equipment levelling system.A nicely realised World environment, with the city in ruins.'Dungeons' for when you don't feel like following a story, and just want a blast.Achievements that are fair and feel rewarding to accomplish.Negatives:The bugs and glitches. There are plenty...The story feels disjointed and needs cleaning up. It loses track easily, and you often feel like you missed something.Lots of uneccessary 'filler' in the game. A cover system where 99% of your enemies use melee, for example.Conclusion:I really feel like this is a missed opportunity for a great game. It needs a lot of work to make this happen, but it is well within the realms of possibility. It is receiving regular updates, and I hope these will help polish out these problems, but until then I cannot recommend this game, even though I really want to. When this happens, I will gladly change to a thumbs up."

,Not Recommended,310890,14275038,"Posted: 1 February, 2015",all,Vriz,"TLDR: Early Access Alpha, come back again later this year.Gameplay:If you played the original BnC, this game's tactical mechanics is very streamlined because the map is absolutely massive. What you get is a topdown shooter with decent controls WASD format. Use of skills fromclasses will certainly take a backseat as the medic and weapon sergeant are all the main skills to use for the first hour. You WILL have teammates die and you'll definitely need them to be revived which is the first default skill for the medic. Weapon Sergeants (heavy gunners) can suppress an entire hoard down, dedicate two of your squad mates to be Weapon Sergeants. They'll make this into EZ mode.Sounds:Decent for what they are as of this build. Don't expect too much yet.Graphics:They don't make my eyes bleed so they're decent.Cons as of Alpha:-The city is still very unfinished-Tactical overlook while in the map/ can lead to buildings disappearing when looking into other parts of the city. Heavily advise limiting/avoid using the the camera to see farther for now-AI is not yet perfect, while your teammates are competent as of Alpha, the enemy humans: Mercs and whatnot, will stand there as their comrades die shot by shot. The movement of your team is also pretty haphazard, you will lose a man just leaving the area trying to get into his squad position because you're too close to the wall.-Bugged ammo, will sometimes net you a 9999 ammo (in my case, the Assault Rifle) and in turn, will lead to a eventual crash.Summary:Do I suggest you buying this game? Yes, it fills a very niche roll and buying it now will not have you pay the full game price when it does fully release. Does it mean you should play it in this Alpha build? Answer is two-fold.1. As a casual gamer, no.2. As an interested customer, yes. Help sort out the bugs for the versions to come and lead the way for other gamers to enjoy this game."

The problem is that the tactical component is weak and the game gets repetitive very quickly. The RPG component is quite generic, generic zombie infestation, generic characters, generic skills. Basically this game fails to stand out in either of its targeted genres. Ultimately the developers tried to mix the original Breach & Clear (which is quite good by the way) with How To Survive. The end product, especially given developers capabilities judging by the original Breach & Clear, is disappointing.To add to this unexplained FPS drops and occasional bugs with control and you get few hours of interesting gameplay before you get bored.One Grumpy Russian score - 5/10 only entertaining when flow of vodka in your blood is at a constant speed of a bottle and a half per hour.For more reviews join:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ogrreview/"

Buying it when it was in the early stages of development and constantly weaving through squads of characters to kill everything in my path was so satisfying.  The gameplay is simple & tactical.  Point & Click and issue commands in command mode or go knee deep just using your mouse and keyboard to travel around with your squad. Mind you, you can alternate between command and normal mode at anytime.  Different classes with different skills that you can use to your advantage in combat.  Different weapons you can use as well (SMG, Shotgun, AR, Grenades) to your liking and style of your squad.  What really impresses me is how the devs actually work with the community to help with updates and bugs.  A dedicated group for an underhyped game.  Overall Deadline is a great buy if you like tatical, military, zombie, strategy, top-down combat style games.  Especially if you liked the original Breach & Clear."

It's actually alot more active, so you can change unit orders on the fly if needed. Rather than being short ops against set enemies it's an open world with semi random encounters. Deadline also uses this to add a more RPG aspect to the game, even going so far as to have side quest. As usual with any zombie games the bigger threat seems to be other humans so get ready for that. All in all I've enjoyed this game, and fans of the original probably would too."

Sadly when I first got it, the game had a lot of issues with the coop aspect such as crashes, glitches (if your coop partner dies then your game just doesn't progress sometimes) and a lot of network issues such as desync. Instead of trying to fix the coop they completely removed it which destroys the reason why I got the game in the first place.======The Good======1. RPG like - Rather enjoyed the rpg style where you can level and customize your character. Being able to create a 4 man squad with elements suits your play style such as having an all sniper team or mix and match. On top of that your coop friend can use 2 of their own members to join your team however it takes 2 members from your team out of the game which is still fine.2. Coop - Even though broken I enjoyed the aspect of being able to control 2 units while a friend controls the other 2. When it did work we enjoyed the experience but sadly it came to an end when the game broke and when the developers removed the coop aspect.========The 50/50========1. Story - The story is basic for the whole zombie and very linear. The enemies  you face are pretty much the same thing over and over with the odd random creature appearing to spice  the game up but sadly it doesn't help move the story on and most times your just hoping the game will end soon so you can check it off your list of beating it. The story leaves a lot missing and confusing by the end.======The Bad======1. Removal of coop - Instead of attempting to fix the issue, the developers sadly removed the feature. It would of been nice for more communications and having the community vote to have more effort put into fixing the coop vs content update/fixes. A simple solution could be to add steamwork and allow players to try fixing the problem themselves, there are many talented individuals that have proven they can solve some of  the issues or make mods that completely revamp the system improving it for more enjoyment...Hell just look at Xcom2, someone is doing a Online Coop mod which has it's problems but works from a game that never designed the game to have such a system in the first place.2. Bugs - The game is sadly filled with bugs such as glitching through the map, quests breaking, getting stuck in mission areas which prevents you from progressing unless you completely kill all the enemies which can't be done because the enemies you need to kill either didn't spawn or glitched somewhere you can't reach them. There are also bugs with the U.i and controls such as trying to use your abilities with not always work or trying to order your units to stay and hold a location ends up having them run head on into the enemies to get devoured or shot to death.3. A.i - This has been fixed a bit but there are times where the a.i can be rather broken. For example they can easily get stuck on a box,car or even on a sidewalk and there are other times they can be extremely aggressive taking out your team with a massive force that even with top end gear you find yourself fustrated on the situation.( A prime example is in the mines where you have to find some objective, near the objective level you will bump into an area filled with terrorists that just have a better position and able to burn you down before you take one of them out...on top of that if you do manage to kill a few of them...zombies will start appearing behind you making it a sandwich with you being the in the middle.)======Overall======Sadly with the coop gone and the reminders (achievements, 2 pack purchase option) slapping a lot of us in the face that wanted the coop experience, this game is rather hard to recommend. The game is okay but with large amount of bugs still in the game I would rather recommend their Breach and Clear standard game which is more turn based focus but a good singleplayer experience with most of the same features as Deadline just without zombies (you can customize and you have a 4 man team). I know the developers have updated the game with a huge patch after removing the coop but sadly there are still problems with the game, a lot were fixed I have to admit and credit the developers for but there are still a bunch there.I would recommend buying it on sale or getting Breach & Clear (the standard game) for your singleplayer experience."

Oh well, done to death, but worth looking at if you view them as 'The Infected' instead (again, sadly, done to death but what the hey!). If you've played the original prepare for the next evolution of the CQB title.I was not impressed at first with the new re-design choices made from the start, as this was touted as being a PC-focused release, and not a mobile port as with the original title (a brilliant port I might add). The focus on controllers threw me though (not very PC at all), and the locked WASD format (something I've never used) irked me no end. BUT...but! All has been adressed since I bought the game instantly in EA. There is now mouse control for movement as well as remappable keys. With so much work being done by the Devs, something many others might take note of, endless updates, tweaks and patches are being implemented. The evs particulalrly listen to what is said on the Forums, no matter how heated the debate sometimes gets (yep, my hand is raised!).The graphics are top notch, and the behaviours of all units (controllable or otherwise) are improving with each new patch. The gameplay is squad-based CQB, in closed and open areas as with the first, and instantly changes to pause-plan-battle when going into 'set pieces'.If you haven't bought into this franchise yet, and are a fan of squad-based tactics and story-driven strategy, then read no further. Look at a Youtube video if you must, but buy and enjoy the game(s) please.This is Indie Development at it's finest, folks."

They are 'tactically' placed in the best cover in all the areas and can consistantly see further through the fog of war than your characters. meaning you usually get shot before you CAN see that there are enemies.Even during ""raiders are attacking our base! defend!"" events you're required to run all over the map finishing off all the raiders who never assaulted your base in the first place. they enter the map, find the best place to camp against you and then wait for gravity to eventually pull all matter in the universe back into another big bang event.Your troops have ammo in this game and so they need to reload. This game handily has them reload after every combat when they are standing stillExcept they only do it about half the time and there is no way you can manually make them reload, so you are constantly entering combat with at least one character who has hardly any ammo and will need to immediately reload.Most things that look like cover are not.Pushed over table? Not cover.Hide behind a counter? Not cover.Peek around a book case? Not cover.I have no idea why it would have been designed like this.Bad Form.Player characters consistantly fail to follow the objectives you give them, stopping randomly in the middle of tasks. the worst part being that they will do NOTHING until you cancel thier last order, often leaving them standing out in the open or allowing zombies to walk up and kill them as they wont respond.The map IS INCREDIBLY WRONG! about 20% the walls on the minimap are not actually there. There are countless hallways and door ways that are shown as walls on the minimapIn this game there are 3 forms of time passage:-There's an out of combat mode where the camera is locked to one of your characers and you can walk around (still third person) with the WASD keys.this mode in no way makes controlling your characters or traversing the map any easier as the point and click of the other modes makes serveying the landscape much easier (your camera isnt locked)Your characters are unable to do anything whatsoever in this mode such as take cover, and combat enemies making it       completely useless.Unfortunately the game will force your into 'RP mode?' at random times, causing the controls for your character (the actual buttons you push!) to change.-Theres a pause mode that allows you to tell your forces to do very specific tasks such as moving to locations of looting items and firing at specific targets.The pause mode is where you will spend most of your time in combat as traversing encounters in real time isnt feasible due to the fast pace nature of combat...sort of...Enemies will camp until the eventual heat death of the universe and you're locked in with invisible walls when encounters start so you have no choice but to charge forward into the enemies carefully planned kill box.-Real time mode! iIs only usefull for having your characters follow through with the orders you've given them.unfortunately unlike the first game which had 5 second intervals for turns, this game will not inform you when any of your characters have completed anything such as moving to locations or taking out a specific targets.This leaves you constantly pausing and unpausing the game as your characters can be too far away from each other to see inside the horribly zoomed in camera.I legitimately love this game!There's so much that is really cool abou this game.I am constantly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off playing this game as I don't feel that i have any actual control of my charactersMost things that go wrong feel like they were caused by the TERRIBLE UII want to recomend this game but they need to make this less of a chore to play."

I usually like this kind of mix, but Breach & Clear: Deadline was a disappointment. The developers has made a brave attempt to revive it with the Rebirth patch, but the core gameplay is simply not fun enough.It's too shallow for an RPG, too fast-paced for a tactical game, too simple for a strategy game, and has too poor AI for an action game. The skill-trees of your soldiers are more like the stem of a tree, instead of branching out in different viable ways, and the quest system is simply talk to NPC, get quest, with no dialogue options at all. You can't even reject quests. The zombies are quite straightforward, as you'd expect them to be, while hostile NPCs will retreat to cover and possibly return fire. Strategic choises are very limited, once you have picked your squad you are pretty much set. What's left is to pick which gear to use, as in what brand of assault rifle for your assault rifle guy.So no, I can not recommend this game. It's not all bad, but the things that are bad are so big that I can't disregard them. And most importantly, the game just isn't fun."

,Recommended,310890,14651490,"Posted: 25 February, 2015",all,Scapegoat,"While departing from the turn based strategy style gameplay of the original Breach & Clear Mighty Rabbit Studios has managed to not only improve upon their original title but to also breath new life into the tactical shooter genera. Ok so its not your typical tactical shooter in the sense that is not another FPS trying to  fill in the gap left by the original Rainbow Six that was released in 1998 but Breach & Clear: Deadline might be the first title I would consider as being a worth successor to the crown.Unlike most modern day tactical shooters employ the standard issue run and gun gameplay we could expect from any FPS on the market with the added benefit of being able to target enemies or issue orders to other members of your team. This doesn’t make a tactical shooter. Breach & Clear: Deadline attempts to recapture the tactical control feeling (which is a staple of the genera) that has been missing from other games. It does this by allowing the player to not only issue orders to units like the standard go there and shoot that options you would expect, in Breach & Clear: Deadline the player is able to  issue move commands, move units behind cover, highlight targets, assign arcs of fire, all while gameplay is frozen eliminating the cumbersome feeling of fiddling with controls on the fly. This doesn’t mean you can't just try and run-n-gun your way through the game because that’s also an option, it just wont get you very far.Along side the tactical shooter elements of the game there is also a good bit of a nostalgia due to the open world RPG style gameplay of the original Fallout series that will have you completing quests and looking for gear all while leveling up your squad and selecting different skills from the skill tree to upgrade each character and make your squad fit your play style.Now don't get me wrong Breach & Clear: Deadline isn’t perfect and it's still in development, but so far it has shown to be the model of what an Early Access title should be. First off I think pitting the player against zombies is a little dated at this point and the over all story could use some work. Luckily the developers are actively improving the game based on user comments and bug reports, patches come out to fix major issues fairly promptly, and their very responsive and appreciative of the online community."

Fighting against the human fanatics is one of the most rage-inducing things I've ever done. Your soldiers are guaranteed to miss 80% of their shots, and high cover is bugged so that the enemies' bullets completely ignore it.

I hope they can build those into a more satisfying game where I care more about the scenario and my squad members.  Maybe it's the zombies.  It's hard to get very excited anymore about a game whose sole purpose is shooting zombies. (snore)"

HOWEVER, there are bugs on some of the levels. The coop gameplay is horrible, each players need to press the button together in order to trigger action phase, Each players can only just pick up 2 characters in coop mode! It is not cooperative and it makes you die faster than playing solo. I wish that the dev team would optimise the coop gameplay (and add more friendly AI) in order to give a better experience for the players. Anyway, I would give a 50:50 to this game."

Having said that, Deadline Rebirth is a major step backwards. Many of things that worked well in the original seem horribly broken in this game. The pathing, which is a complete necessity in this type of game to get your soldiers to the proper positions and do their job, only works about 30% of the time. Any time they need to path around objects they get stuck, run in circles, then give up trying, which often leaves your other soldiers unprotected, and the soldier you were trying to move exposed and out of cover. Being able to “stack” commands that will be executed in order ends up feeling clunky, because if you try to quickly adapt to the situation as it develops, if the soldier hasn’t executed their first command, you have to select each one and cancel that command to give them a new one.In general, I feel like most of the strategy available in the first game, which was true turn-based strategy, has been lost in this game by trying to make it more fluid using the time control system. The fact that the pathing is so bad makes you want to avoid the command view altogether and just control your soldier in the top-down shooter mode. I do not recommend this game."

Game can be played in real time and in time-control where you coordinate what the whole team is doing. Quests, Fast-Travel, Multi-level ""Dungeons"", And a color coded loot system are all great additions. Fighting against zombies and enemy humans is likewise a great feature, as they behave differently and pose differnt threats. Zombies are very diverse enemies even in the early-game and promise to become more so. All in all a great game -- and has grown tremendously since early access. Recommended."

The vertical parts of levels are often times hard to recognize from one another.  Inventory system is at times unclear.  This is an early access game currently and needs work - but the framework in place has all the great markers of a great game to come.  Weapons and tactics vary widely enough to provide plenty of options of approach.  The class based squad selection reminds me a lot of the old Rainbow Six games.  The seperate abilities available to each class are varied and provide a useful balance.  The enemy AI is unintelligent, but they are zombies what do you expect them to be, ...smart?  Overall I can recommend getting into this early access if helping this game become a a reality in the tactical top down genre is a good thing to you.  While I have already experienced some bugs within an  hour of gameplay, you can tell this is building up to be a good game.

It is a great squad-based tactical with a satisfying amount of character development options that are not overly complex. It is easy to quickly decide how to assign skill points and customize weapons/gear. You don't feel like you have to obsess over char dev as much as Wasteland 2 (for example).  The musical score is awesome - really helps develop the post-apoc theme and suspense without being a repetitive distraction. The layout of the world feels a little linear rather than sandbox, but I'm only 6 hours in. Thats ok for me because I like having some guidance/direction while still being able to make my own choices on where to explore and what quests to accept. I wish I could customize the controls to my own personal preferences, but at least they assigned all the game functions to keys on the left side of the keyboard, so you don't have to constantly jump from one side to the other. The AI seems a little on the easy side...most of the time my squad kills all enemies before they even get close enough to do any damage. My team just hit level 4, so I am looking for the threat of actually dying to increase as I progress through the campaign. If a difficulty setting exists, I have not found it. The game is great in small doses, but I think I could easily spend a whole day on it without getting bored.

It can still be improved, but otherwise is a good, fun game.  I advise caution early on, as you should not assume your men will naturally move to where they're told 100% of the time.It comes off as a more strategic, and more detailed version of Infested Planet, but focused on four people rather than the constant struggle over an expanding map.  There's some deep strategy here, such as when you're on floor 15 of a building and wondering if you have enough ammo to make it to the top... should you search rooms looking for ammo, switch weapons, or keep the fight limited to the hallway?  Also, the skills and personalized teams help to make the strategy more adjustable.  I've focused on strictly an efficient firing team, complete with sniper and explosives experts, only to curse when I could really use a medic and suddenly have to tiptoe to preserve health.Otherwise, maybe I should have had more medics, or equip a sniper rifle to someone rather than have a trained 'sniper skills.'  These open up the door to future playthrus.My one recommendation would be for the developers to look into more difficulty settings.  I would like to switch up the team and put them in a greater challenge, as some points in this game feel like repetative mowing down, but exciting in searching for better supplies."

First of all it's really interesting, I don't think I've seen many squad based tactical shooters based around the zombie apocalypse. Sure there are games like Trapped Dead but personally I feel Trapped Dead is more like the old game Commandos. On the opposite side of the spectrum there are quite a lot of games like Breach & Clear, all with their own styles and most of them are enjoyable in their own way.The uniqueness of this game lends a lot to the patience and good will I hold for the studio. I know the zombie genre is really over saturated with games and movies (and books and costumes and... well you get the idea) but I feel this does have something to offer. Having played it in it's really early days I did notice a fair amount of issues but generally the theme was there, the game itself was interesting and fun, for me at least.Still, it all comes down to this:Subjectiveness and that is why I'm trying to be positive about this game, simply because I feel like it could be *something* but I can't even play the game.tl;dr 2/5 - I can't play the game, no dev help after contacting them, I have played previously and had fun, buy at your own risk but if you have enjoyed Breach & Clear this might be worth getting but I'd wait for a sale.Suggestions:Try Survivor Squad.

It's full of glitches (the most annoying one being when I beat the game on one save file, started another [it has the option to use your previously saved squad to begin again, this time more challenging, which I like the idea of, but didn't choose] and the game suddenly became five times harder. More enemies of a harder class with higher health than the first time I had played it, as if I HAD chosen to restart with my previously saved squad, even though I didn't). Also what makes it worse is that your friendly AI is just plain god-awful. Your allies get caught up on walls should easily just walk around. If there they are behind cover that is taller than waist-high, instead of leaning out or maneuvering around it they just waste ammo by shooting at the wall/truck/whatever cover they are behind. The shotgun is pretty much useless unless you're within kissing rage of the enemies, and the AI will use it at sniper range which, again, wastes your ammo. When you enter new rooms that require a short loading screen (such as in dungeons) you character begins firing for no reason, waisting ammo and alerting anything within earshot that HEY FOUR ARMY RANGERS ARE HERE COME EAT US!!! The maps are extremely poorly designed and the minimap is just barely useable. I spent 70% of my gameplay just wandering around lost. The game never teaches you how to use fast travel, so THAT took me about 5 hours to figure out I even HAD it available (but maybe I'm just stupid). Oh, and you can't delete old saved games. I've looked up on Steam forums how to actually do it and the process is so complicated it's seriously making me think about just deleting Steam and going back to consols like a plebe.All in all, I know I have just totally trashed this game, but honestly, I'd play it again.

It takes the classic mechanics from the previous game and expands on them in some very interesting ways. Being an early access, it definitely has some problems, but I wouldn't say that stops it from being entertaining.A complaint I have is how limited the tutorial is when it comes to basic controls. It explains most everything pretty well, but it forgets to mention how to target enemies. For example, after completing the tutorial I begin to take out infected. Eventually, a mob comes towards me and I'm confused as to why my squad is just sitting there, even after telling them to hold position and aiming the cone at the enemy. It wasn't until later that I found out you had to queue enemies, which makes the game more challenging and fun.The main menu makes my computer lag, which isn't fun. Even after turning the graphics down it's still slow to navigate the menu. I'm hoping in the future they can fix this, but honestly it's not a huge deal to me.There was also an odd bug I had with the options and trying to lower the settings. The screen came up to configure the shadows and stuff, but nothing was there. Pressing the arrow keys, I heard the cursor moving in the background and eventually changed the settings. It was annoying, but nothing major.I also heard of another problem regarding ammo, which I haven't had enough time to experience yet.

But sadly i kept noticing negative comments about many structural game issues that made me want to hang back and wait for the patch team to sort things out.Well, i cant comment on things before the recent patch but i just finished the game and i really enjoyed it! again its a simple (yet more complex than the original) concept, kill zombies, finish quests, get new guns, upgrade guns... find shiney gold guns that take agaes to upgrade fully!! lol.The game also features two options of play, i.e the original top down command from B & C and the new player controled mode. I found this to be confusing at the start but steadily stared to love positioning my men with ""command"" then taking control of my shotgun character and blasting away myself.Overall, very enjoyable and worth the money in its current state. There are still a few path finding bugs and little things for the devs to streamline but i dont personally believe it affected my enjoyement of the game overall.Appreciate the work guys, thanks for the game."

However it just doesn't feel very easy to play with and I haven't enjoyed it so far. Alternatively a Jagged Alliance type real time with pause style might have done well too.Can't see anything ever changing however due to the games age and the devs not seeming fan orientated.Perhaps have a look for something similar but better, especially at this price."

I do like the concept and I hope the mix of game types will work. I think they have something, combining a twin stick shooter with tactical layer, but that something is still not developed sufficiently to give a final verdict. It needs work. I've been playing with a x360 controller and although sufficient, it is a bit clunky. It needs to be smoother to be a nice twin stick. The tactical layer also needs to be more fluid with the controls. The AI is still pretty basic, so again to early to tell.But I am willing to support the project and I hope they pull this off."

I can't really identify with most of them..half of them look like developers..). The bearded delta and athletic guys are ok though.- no drag&drop to assign weapons, gear etc- no hit zones, headshots, crippling shots are missing- target coning (especially on corners) a bit confusing, much better in B&C- a few bugs- light engine a bit weird, buggy or by design?- very repetitive..no puzzles, no surprises except new mobs sometimes- world map is ugly and seems to contain discrepancies to real world- fast travel is weird (bus stops..really?)"

With the new real-time command mode, you really feel that you are in control over the squad. To the movements, which enemy to attack, what to do at that certain time, the flexibility is fantastic. It's easy to familiarize yourself with the mechanics of the game, but the game itself isn't quite a walk in the park. Even though you are facing melee zombies (for the most part, but you will encounter armed bandits), the game doesn't let you take it easy. You still have to think your actions through, and make sure you don't make unforced errors, as at times, it can turn the tides to their favor. The mix of RTS, top-down shooter, and an RPG-esque campaign feels something really fresh.Deadline's gameplay is certainly fun. With a mix of different classes, all with their respective specialties, the gameplay becomes very satisfying when they get used properly, and the plans comes together. Story-wise, the plot isn't anything that special, but not horrible to the point that it ruins the game. On terms of replayability, although you can only control a 4-man squad (there are 6 classes overall), you can replay the game and try using different combinations of classes as the gameplay can greatly change, however the downside is that the plot isn't really something that much replayable. However, you can play dungeons, which is great if you're more on gameplay than going for the plot.Overall, Deadline is a great sucessor to the original Breach and Clear (which was great as well) although there were ocassional bugs, most of have been dealt with on the recent patches. As much as I recommend it, I suggest that you buy it on sale because it is a bit overpriced.I give the game an 7.8/10. Even though the game has some downsides, I think it makes up for it with its awesome gameplay.+Excellent gameplay+Very rewarding*graphics isn't bad, but isn't that great either.-Plot isn't anything that special-low replayability (you can play on dungeons though)-a 'lil bit expensive"

This game has great RPG elements and some loot collection that I love and keep me interested in exploration and replay. I will say that the game can be buggy, my first play I had a game breaking glitch, after that it was pretty smooth until recently but most of the bugs are easy to fix with a quick restart. That said the developers seem to be constantly working on fixes and updating the game with patches that actually make the game experience better as a whole and not just minor fixes.

This is a whole different twist, kind of Tactically played like Dragon Age Origins (with Pauses/planning), but in a Left 4 Dead world, without the T&A chicks.  Kind of a knockoff, but not as repetitive as L4D, single player.  Love the flares attracting hords, while tossing cocktail right into them, or laying down claymore mines for the Rushers trying to hit from behind.  My favorite Suppressing Fire is still effective, but eats up the limited ammo.From what I'm hearing, it's not a full game.  I hardly noticed that, with less bugs than majority of games out there, still addictive to play!  The issues are the story is predictable, slightly dry, and NPCs don't have audio dialogue like the player's team already has a bit of, nor do they move or do anything on their own.  Not a whole lot of action other than shooting everything that moves, unlike original B&C that had Bomb Disarming, Terrorist hunt, and Escape modes that kept it fun.Gameplay is still great, with sometimes being overwhelmed by zombies from behind, while being shot at by Mercs, and no where to run.  A lot of customizing perks tree is available when leveling up your team, but no individual stats.

It reminded me a lot of the old school Xbox games like Conflict Desert Storm and others. As much as I enjoyed it though, its not a game I can recommend. Simply put the game-play is rather repetive, couple with the full price of being $20; just not worth it.Pros:-Character-development: You can choose between a variety of classes each with unique perks. This adds some flavor to the game. Additionally characters can be cross trained between classes enabling you to do that demolitionist sniper or whathave you.-Audio: Audio is pleasant on the ears. Nothing you'll remember, but it wasnt bad.-Loot-This is both a good and bad component for the game. There was a variety of loot offered, however it was laregely hit and miss. I ended up using the same gun for almost the entire game just because I happened to find a powerful one early one. Also the entire game I found maybe 4 snipers total, including the one I started with; which sucked given that one of my characters was a sniper. Only found 6 shotguns, 4 of which were the exact same thing, and the other 2 the exact same thing.-Devs: I've seen the Developers making efforts to respond to people's posts. They actively seem concerend and are making an effort, so this is a big win for me, but still not enough to recommend the game.Cons:-Loot-Could've been done much better as seen above.-Repetiveness-I found a dungeon that was 20-floors. I literally went through room by room, clearing out all 20 floors. It got extremely old, very fast. I would play a few floors for an hour or so before getting bored.-Story-You're in a lab! Now back to me again! You're shot down! Go here kill this, grab these supplies. Rinse and repeat ad-nausem. No explanation of the zombie origin, how far the infection has spreaded, etc... Its borderline non-existent. Like Destiny non-existent.-Price-Game is NOT worth $20. Max I woulda payed for this is like $5-$10. Just not worth it.-Co-Op: Does it Work? No."

,Recommended,310890,26723684,"Posted: 20 November, 2016",all,TurboLento,"I feel like the recent reviews have been very unfair and incomplete, or we've been playing a different game.This game mixes missions in ""real time with pause"" squad tactics with an open world with loot RPG (where you explore the world, finding new gear or materials to upgrade your current gear). The open world and RPG factors gives this new approach an interesting flow of exploration, loot gathering, and then entering missions where tactics become very important. You get 4 soldiers in your squad which feels more than enough.As your soldiers level up, they gain skill points that you can use to upgrade their skills. Even though they start with pre defined classes, you're allowed to pick skills from any other class if you wish, effectively allowing multi-classing and many options of customizing your soldiers.It's very streamlined, the amount of interaction options is simple but allows for good tactics (run to spot ignoring fire, strafe to spot firing in assigned direction, auto fire or hold fire, switch to side weapon, reload, use skill or use inventory item). I played with gamepad, to which it has full support, and it's very comfortable doing so (in a genre which rarely pays attention to gamepad play, as you'll well know if you've bought other games of the genre).The introduction of zombies brings a new avenue of tactics, where it becomes mostly about quick repositioning, controlling your troop spacing, keeping obstacles between you and them, keeping your distance to the fast incoming waves of enemies, and ammo/reload management, instead of the more cover/flanking approach to the enemy human encounters. The zombie scenario also allows for the story of a small squad roaming a dangerous open world, needing to scavenge to upgrade your gear, etc.Beside zombies, you'll also face human enemies with guns, and they are very accurate and lethal, demanding good tactics management from you. You'll have to frequently pull back your soldiers and spend some time looking at your inventory, considering your options of flashbangs, smoke grenades, etc, and also consider your soldier specific skills to figure out how to approach each scenario.The real time with pause makes missions have a fun quick pace, especially with the zombie missions, a nice mix of action and strategy.During my 3 hours of play, I came across absolutely ZERO bugs.A solid and refreshing entry in the strategy tactics games scene."

As long as you consider it a single player title (coop was taken out) and buy it at a budget price (5-10 bucks max) it's pretty decent value. It's still a bit different from the original (it actually reminds me somewhat of the old Shadow Company game), but still enjoyable.My main gripes:-Still a few annoying (though not gamebreaking) bugs and issues; swapping firearms doesn't change them, unable to breakdown ammo for scrap, ammo limits too low on some weapons (can't run 2 assault rifles). Small stuff like that which is noticable, but not the end of hte world.-The Dungeon's can get quite repetitive. Twenty floors of Jupiter start to feel more like work than play at some point.-Loot lists are a bit off; I got about 20 useless breaching shotguns before getting one that was actually better than the starting gun, same with the sniper rifles; no upgrades there. There's no design to prevent random lists from screwing you over.-More city would have been nicer. Now it feels like the designers just tossed in extra repetitive copy/paste dungeons to make up for it so it wouldn't be too short.-Actual voice-acting and more missions would have been nice. Right now it's not very immersive.But all in all I think it's still a fairly enjoyable title if you can get it at a nice price. 20 bucks is too much, but on the cheap it's nice.

As far as I have gotten the mechanics in game are decent and well made, IMO. The story so far, including the proluge, is decent so far but a little underhwelming but that may only be beacuse I haven't gotten very far into the game yet.I have completed 3 primary objectives and no secondary objectives in my current playthrough, which isn't my first but is my best.

You will either enjoy it or you won\'t.With that said lets jump inYoure basically a squad of special forces trying to get stuff did.You fight zombies, special zombies MUTANT ZOMBIES I DERSAY.You command a squad of four people, there are five classes (6?) I believe. Each class has its own signature weapon, Assault Rifles, LMG\'s, Shotguns, Snipers and submachine guns.Each class has roughly 3-5 active abilitites that let them do stuff.A lot of times when dealing with enemies its pretty rock paper spock lizard demon, I.E there are multiple ways to deal with them. BUT that doesn't stop you from branching into other classes skill tree's or their weapons. Infact you can build your team however you want, Example: Four demolitionst with LMG's, suppression and medic skills.There is real time that lets you run and gun and a tactical mode. Tactical mode lets you pause, issue orders, move your squad e.t.c Just a piece of advice, you can change it from holding down the key to keep it running to a toggle, just learned this five minutes ago.In addition, while the storyline is somewhat linear, espically the begining, they have multiple procedural generated dungeons for funsies.Also, if you do get this game, make sure to right click on the .exe in the steamfiles and make sure you are using your dedicated graphics card not your integrated. My biggest turn off was for a while I couldn\'t play this as it would run at 5fps, I know its horrible. I learned my Nividia card didn\'t always activate thanks to Mordheim, and now I sit at a steady 30-45, again not the best but its an improvement.Overall I love this game, its quaint, its unique, its a specific niche game that I enjoy because its simplistic nature. I also love it cause not many games give you the real time/pause tactical squad based gameplay, Red Solstice single player being my other favorite of this genre.Just to summarize, watch lets plays, know that this is a specific niche game, it is not for everyone, bugs and issues do exist, and a few can be personally fixed."

Usually you can get lucky and solve this with upgraded demo skills or a sniper but occasionally you get the flimsy enemy that decides ""hey I like this giant rock. Let me stand behind it"" and you get indefinitely locked in combat which makes it impossible to pass on. Again. Not a BIG issue but some fights are so annoying or painful that this AO issue makes you just go ""I'm done"""

There are very few hints on how things work, what distinguishes the weapon types, what are the particularities of the zombie classes.And I could forget all of the above if the combat would be interesting, but it's not. The original Breach and Clear had a much more interesting combat system where setting up firing lines, crossfire, flanking maneuvers and getting into cover actually mattered. Here, it feels as if you just move your squad a bit, meet a bunch of enemies, stand still and kill them, then repeat. Someone compared this to XCOM in another review... this has nothing on XCOM in terms of tactical depth, as all enemies behave pretty much the same and squad positioning seems to be perfectly unimportant.I won't recommend this. It is a pity, though, it feels like this is a good base on which to build a good squad-based tactical strategy game, but there's just not enough depth."

Nothing wrong with that in itself, if it weren't for the game not showing/telling you so and potentially leaving you confused/looking for help. I got stuck going from one area to the next for a good 15 minutes before finding out there's an invisible area you could click on to progress, or hit the enter key.The biggest disappointment for me was that I finished the game with a level 11 squad using green and blue weapons and equipment, none of which was upgraded fully and did not have to use strategy at any point in the game. I could move my squad together at all times and just move through zombies or walk around and flank human enemies.I suppose you can use each member individually and assign orders and have fun with it, but it's simply not needed.All in all I had fun with it, but being able to roflstomp through the entire game start to finish without needing strategy was not what I had in mind buying a... strategy game."

SO, they decide to revamp the game and remove co-op since most problems with the game stemmed from that bad code, lack of ability to MP code correctly on the Devs part, whatever.

At least the revamp is more than man other hit and run Devs do. I've had no problem, and the game now is at least fun and playable.

At leats the game now looks and plays better even if it is just SP. So to any new people looking at the reviews, check for the words ""Co-op"", if seen, stop reading and skip on to the next one. As the review is just whining about them removing co-op = nothing about the SP game itself which is , for now, all this is. And it's a good/fun game , especially for the sale price.

Lots of confusion around this fact.   From deep reads most peeps who have played it thru really enjoy it for what it is; military themed, tactical action game.   Setting is great!  It's not XCOM, but few games are.  Definite recommend!"
,Not Recommended,310890,17013315,"Posted: 12 July, 2015",all,CTi flauxhawk,"Deadline plays in two major modes: an 'Action' mode which bears similiarities to twin-stick shooters - and a 'Tactical' mode (a pause, issue orders, then go system) which allows you to precisely positions your troopers and issue them commands. These commands include using special abilities, directing their fire and utilizing equipment such as grenades and medkits. You have four troopers in your squad recruited from various classes, each replete with their own special abilities (suppression, explosives, etc.) Your characters gain experience and level up from completing missions and slaying enemies such as zombies and mercenaries. They can then expend skill points to unlock new abilities. Characters can even 'cross-class' if they save up the skill points, allowing you to develop more versatile characters. Aside from some of the active abilities the passives include 5% increased chance to crit, 5% increased damage with a particular weapon category or 5% increased health. They aren't spectacular on their own but if you cross-class the right classes you can find some abilities and upgrades that properly complement each other.Weapons, equipment and weapon modifications can be looted from crates and dead mercenaries. These weapons can also be modded provided they have the slots (up to 3). The weapon mods aren't terribly exciting though - they typically include items such as scopes, gas systems and triggers that either up the fire rate, improve accuracy or improve damage (while typically lowering accuracy). You can also spend scrap (in-game currency) to upgrade armor and weapons. However this just ups DPS or armor value by a set amount and the cost increases with each upgrade. Again, nothing too exciting there.The zombies come in a few flavors include shamblers, runners, acid spitters and some big hulking brutes. If you get swarmed your characters will easily be cut down. Luckily if you have a medic you can revive on the spot. Barring that your dead teammates will rejoin you when you visit a safehouse. Safehouses include workbenches for modding and upgrading weapons as well as storage for excess items.Mercenaries are distinguished by the weapons they wield - sniper rifles, assault rifles, shotguns, etc. They too can cut you down pretty quickly if you're exposed.There are 'dungeons' of a sort in-game. Certain areas have multiple floors that you can explore for loot and experience. Each level of the dungeon has an exit that takes you back to the starting point regardless of how deep you've made it. In addition they are interspersed with safehouse-like floors that refill health and allow you access to a workbench and locker. I'm not sure how 'deep' these dungeons go (the furthest I could stomach was about 8 floors in the Jupiter Building). Each floor or level isn't particularly different from the previous ones in layout so you do feel like you're exploring the same layout over and over after a few floors.Overall the game is enjoyable and fun, providing a mix of isometric-style shooting with some tactical direction. There is some character progression and development and while not as deep or exciting as I would like it works, especially with cross-classing. The missions and storyline have you backtracking quite a bit but the devs were kind enough to add in a fast-travel system so you aren't constantly walking back and forth.TL;DR: Military dudes shoot zambies in action or tactical mode. Level up, find equipment, customize characters.Post-release and patches edit: It seems that the developers have decided to throw in randomized zombie spawns during tactical gun battles with bandits, raiders, etc. While I could understand this as 'sound drawing the zombies to your location' the way it is currently handled is atrocious. I've had zombies spawn directly on top of my soldiers, directly behind with no warning. Previously zombies spawned outside of the combat zone and closed in on your location. Now they seem to spawn on top of you or behind you. This one change requires me to change my review to not recommended. This issue needs to be addressed for enjoyable, balanced gameplay.In addition human enemies with firearms can easily sit behind cover and almost never be hit while your own soldiers - behind comparable cover - easily get shot over and over again. There's really no point in trying to do anything other than tossing explosives in these situations as even the slightest attempt at suppression and flanking will see your men shredded within seconds."

If your into RTS zombie games this is for you. Took me till the end of the game to figure out that the middle mouse button rotates the screen. Hopefully they keep adding content to this game because its a really good game

I´m going to ask for my money back, and maybe, in the future, if and when they fix the game and co-op run smoothly I´ll buy it again, as I said, it´s an OK game, but don´t buy it if your intention is to play with your friends.PORTUGUÊSCertamente tem potencial e é um bom game para se jogar sozinho, mas no meu caso, que praticamente só jogo co-op, e comprei este jogo para jogar co-op especificamente, é puro desperdício de tempo e dinheiro, Eu joguei por 13h basicamente tentantdo conectar com meu amigo.

After months of complaining last year, and many, many patches from the devs, I was able to play most of what I'm guessing is the first level the game before it fatally crashed. Unbeknownst to me (and, judging from the reviews, most of the previous purchasers), the devs were hard at work trying to *fix* the game. So, lo and behold, I log on to Steam today and see that there is a NEW UPDATE!Say what?!Hell yeah there is. Apparently, it's enough of an update to warrant adding a new word to the title (and 2016, lest you confuse it for the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that they released previously).So, what am I to do? I swore off the game and this company after getting royally ♥♥♥♥ed out of my hard-earned money last year, but I am a forgiving man. Tis the season and all that, so I forgave and downloaded the ""new"" game, not expecting much, but willing to give it a chance. So, how does this one stack up to the previous one?I have no ♥♥♥♥ing idea, because they've made it 64-bit ONLY and I'm hobbling along on a 32-bit system. They don't tell you that in the specs, either, so future buyers beware.In keeping with the spirit of giving that is in the air this holiday season, I've got to give a big  ♥♥♥♥ YOU to the company that made and released this absolutely garbage game. After all, it's the least I could do, considering all the shafting they game me and others last year.P.S. - I hope Santa takes a giant♥♥♥♥♥♥in your stocking.Merry Christmas!"

A military combat zombie apocolypse game.Pros so far:- Cool switching between tactical gameplay and command mode.- Interesting and in depth skill trees- Co-op tactical game? Awesome...- The content so far is great, hope they keep adding.Cons so far:- Combat is buggy at times- Co-op is pretty buggy- I know its alpha, but visual character movement could be improved.Fun game so far. Look forward to playing it a hell of a lot more when co-op is tweaked to perfection.Worth it."
