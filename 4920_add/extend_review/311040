Nothing is explained past a couple of examples of how to introduce a piece of legislation into the parliament and how to order a military operation against a terrorist cell. Budgetary information is poorly presented, making it cryptically difficult to know what measures are affecting the bottom line and by how much. The UI is attrocious.After a couple of hours poking around, I feel like I've made no progress whatsoever. I have no idea what to do, what I'm doing or what in the world is affecting what. It's a complete mess.Although I have a degree of interest in politics and world affairs, I'm completely lost. I find that without a sufficiently solid understanding of economics, the player is going to miss out on a whole chunk of this games appeal.Unless you're a student of economics and/politics, and can put up with a clunky interface, and occasional buggy elements that don't make much sense, steer clear of this one.3/10"

Rulers of Nations is a mixed bag. Not as bad as some are saying.I expected a total mess of clutter and illogical AI. To my pleasure, the game is neither impossible to learn nor enjoy. There's actually quite a comprehensive and well thought-out simulation of running a modern state lurking under the poor graphics, cheap UI, uneven difficulty and mountains of stats. You'll certainly be kept busy with tons of decisions to make about laws, budgeting, trade, diplomacy etc.I've seen reviews comparing this unfavourably to games like Superpower 2 and Supreme Ruler. I disagree - this game is definitely superior to either of those.If the price were lower, I'd recommend it strongly to anyone interested in the subject matter. As it is, I'd say buy it only if you're really curious and have some cash to spare."

This isvery muchnot a wargame, although there is war in it. In fact, you would be better off playing Civ than this if you prefer a good war element. With that out of the way, I can understand one other major frustration: the bugs. The most annoying one (and the only one I have really noticed so far) is the building glitch. Don't expect that to get fixed, as the new version Masters of the World has already been released.Now for why I recommended this. Quite simply, this game is addictive. Once you get the hang of it, you find youself so concerned for what happens to your country next that you find yourself thinking about it all the time. How will I finish this war? What am I going to do with my new-found funds? Should I subsidize my X industry or Y industry, if I can't subsidize both? Lots of decisions to be made. The spying is one of the best made systems I have seen from any game in a long time. It isn't 'wait X turns to have an 80% chance of stealing a technology.' It has much more to do with infiltrating terrorist organizations, assassinating others, political espianage, and more. There will sometimes be moles in your organization that will mess up everything, and you should have a decent amount of spies keeping an eye out for others trying to spy on you. The accounting/economics is a bit over my head, but they do a good enough job of explaining it for me to have half a clue what I am doing.Overall, fun game. Looking forward to Masters of the World eventually."

THIS GAME CRASHES IF YOU TRY TO RUN IT ON A 32-BIT.Now, on to the actual review.Pros:-Unique game design-You can literally pick any country you want, and play as that country for virtually all of time-Huge variety of things to do (i.e. managing immigration policy, gun laws, family laws, race laws, religious laws, military laws, and foreign policy)-Realistic government set-up-Congressional votes-Presidential Campaigns for re-election-Wide variety of espionage options (i.e. assassinations, government moles)-Ability to make any country into any government type (i.e. making the United States a totalitarian state, ruled by a ruthless dictator, banning free religion and speech. This cannot be done rapidly unless you want to put down civil revolts.)-Wars are somewhat fun, but can get a tad repetitive if you like conquering the world.-NukesCons:-One of the glitchiest games I have ever played.-Absolutely NOT compatible Windows 32-bit of any kind.-The Voices can get annoying.-Some features may not work like they're supposed to.-The face animation needs some work.-The company that designed this game, Eversim, doesn't update it whatsoever.Final Verdict: 7/10If you can overlook the ocassional glitch, and you love Geo-political Simulators, then I definitely recommend this."

And since the last time I've played it, they have made significant improvements. However there are some functional problems with the game. Certain features, including ordering the construction of military bases, refugee camps and power facilities has some sort of error which will not allow you to select the place to build it. I've noticed some scrambled code gibberish pop up in place of people's names in the newspaper articles. I also always have problems with uncontrollable crime rates, despite increasing police forces and budget and increased focus on education and reducing unemployment. Regardless of this, the game eventually sends the country into anarchy and civil war due to excessive crime rates. I don't know why this keeps happening. There is also the lunacy of random celebrities getting in trouble which for some bizarre reason damages your approval rating (comparable with if Lindsay Lohan landed in rehab and then everyone blamed Obama for it). Overall decent game. Still needs more work. Buy it when it's on sale."

I have to say that I love this game and it was exactly what I was looking for at the time. I think a key here is to try not to take things to seriously and think the game is going to match real life.However there is so much going on and everything you do seems to affect something so your decisions feel important.There are some bugs in the game though I can't specifically think of any off hand and the graphics are not the greatest but it's not a shooter.It does take some time to grasp the economy which I must admit I am still trying to do...Wars are not just walk in and take over, there are many things to think about and many repercussions for actions. Those could come from Allies of the country you attacked, from the UN, from your own people or cabinet members. You could have problems with refugees during Wars which I did as Israel I ran into a problem where I had refugees from a city in the far North which Syria took from me. I think maybe because of the small size of the country I was unable to find a suitable location for the camp (maybe a bug). In the end the refugees left for Jordan. Maybe someday they'll come back.  I did eventually take the city back and the War ended with Syria with no gains for either side. Now much like real life we both have troops around the borders and tensions are high. This is why this game is great.If you are looking for a game where you control a country, and where your moves can really affect what is going on around you then check this out. I am trying to decide if it's worth throwing down the $50 for GPS3."

,Not Recommended,311040,15826487,"Posted: 14 May, 2015",all,Gaffnp,"I actually DO recommend this game. I've been playing since 2010. It's enormous fun, especially if you're into politics. Sadly it also plays so very badly on anything that isn't a good gaming PC - even though it's now five years old. In a nutshell, the company that made this game had a fantastic idea but apparently outsourced the coding to a team of below-average intelligence monkeys. It is a MASSIVE drain on resources despite being an almost completely menu-based game; many of the bugs people report aren't bugs at all, but serious memory problems that hit lower-end machines. I have a brand new gaming PC that runs this thing like a charm - it can get through a term (4 -5 years) of gameplay in an hour, rarely crashes and handles reasonably smoothly. My older PC, which was good at the time this was released, takes an hour to get through one year, crashes completely at random (anywhere from 12 times in 20 minutes to once in 2 hours) due to memory problems and is unbearably laggy. Furthermore, the game is still incredibly buggy - EverSim opted to release new editions of the game rather than seriously fix old ones, with each new installment being more messed up than the last.Having said all of that, the game is still enormously fun, and has improved from launch in 2010. Most countries are now realistically playable. If you're really enthusiastic about politics, this game can be very enjoyable - it has much more depth to it than any other geopolitical sim, and the emphasis here really is on managing a country's domestic politics and economy. It has some bizarre quirks in its model - inflation for instance will always track economic growth (have 8% growth and eventually inflation will hit 8%), meaning some innovative and gamey solutions are needed to avoid stagnation. But it is still easily the most thorough and rewarding political simulator out there, despite its problems. Some countries are more flawed than others, but there are usually workarounds to make every one playable. If you have a high-end PC and a love of politics, get it. Otherwise, this game is not worth your money or frustration."

Also, it can be very buggy for some, me, I never encountered any bugs or glitches yet, and I do not expect to. Wars are hard to declare with most countries because organizations, public opinions and finances are very hard to fight off.Pros: I like the realism of the game and fine detail, as statistics and organization of everything in the country you rule is present. You really are in control of almost every aspect of a country, and this game does a fantastic job of displaying that. I like the government systems and political parties, they determine the style of your country and what policies it restricts you or limits you to hold. You can learn a lot from what this game gives you about the world, and it can get pretty fun and straightforward if you know what you are doing.I recommend this game if you want to rule any country of the world and see how to run a country."

Sadly the reason why it is so crap is because no matter what you do you will end up voted out in the first 30 days! You can do anything sit there and do nothing or pass through lots of laws that really sort out the country. It doesn't matter there will still be huge protests calling you xenophobic or a dictator and then you'll either be killed at some random event that you didn't even plan in your diary to attend or you'll be deposed. This game could be brilliant but its the imposibility of the popularity system in this game that makes it not worth buying!
