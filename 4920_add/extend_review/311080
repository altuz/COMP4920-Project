,Recommended,311080,11136994,"Posted: 8 July, 2014",all,c2oxycodone,"There might be some nastalgia playing into my review of this game. It's recalls my favorite time in gaming, when titles like Terminal Velocity and Descent Dominated PC gaming. The tourtorial is a bit lacking so taking some time learning the controls from the options menu first will go a long way, the instant action option is a nice touch and multiplayer (with some system tweaking) is workable and entertaining at lans.To address the Negative reviews:There seems to be a trend of people assuming that this new wave of old games getting re-released on steam are similar to 'remakes' available on consoles. These are more like diving in the bargin bin at a local retailer. They aren't repolished with new fixes for modern machines, most will require a few extra steps to get running and this should be expected if you are buying anything before 2009. This one is no exception, luckily there aren't as many issues as with some other titles. I was able to get it up and running by right clicking on the gamelauncher.bat in the install folder and running as administrator. After  running it once this way it launches fine from steam. Just so you don't think I have some odd setup that might be old enough to be compatible:i7 3770k16 gigs of ddr3Geforce 780Win7 x64240gig SSD"

The graphics have not aged particularly well, and the menus are sometimes a pain to navigate, but overall it remains a solid arcade-ish ""action sim"", with neat gameplay and a bit of originality, some of which has remained to this day even. There aren't a whole lot of these ""futuristic VTOL gunship"" sims on PC nowadays for some reason.In regards to the Steam release: Well, the English localization is an interesting contrast to the Russian I remember. And the game did not launch for me the first time around. It took me theunimaginably difficulteffort of going to the game's install directory and running the game's launch script as an administrator to set up the necessary registry and be able to play. (:P)No, I didn't notice the line in the system requirements telling me to run the game as an administrator at first either.Not needing a CD in the drive (which this tablet doesn't have anyway) is a definite plus over the times I played it in the past though. :P"

This release, however, is broken. It runs, but requires a lot of work to get running. Buy at your own risk. Also, for some reason they replaced the old menu music with something awful."

I don't have any delusions about it supporting 5.1, or modern resolutions, or my xbox controller. However, it should be sold in such a state that it launches and is playable.

,Recommended,311080,26136952,"Posted: 20 October, 2016",all,Railer666,"I have had this game in my steam library for a while now. It was one of my favorite games that I used to play. But I could never get the Steam version to run. But today I came across a post by cyanic and he has made a patch to get this game to work. It was nothing less than awesome to get to play this game again. So thanks go out to cyanic for his help to Echelon gamers in the Steam Community. This game is just as good as I remember. The controls are unique and once you get used to them, very effective. Yes the graphics show a little age and the models a little dated as far as textures go. But some of the ships were and still are awesome looking ship designs. If this game could be modded with updated graphics.Maybe more detailed models or just a modern revamp of the whole game.I think it would be an instant success. With this game still being great and with the fact that you can now get the Steam version to play by running the patch that cyanic created. I couldn't imagine it not being in my collection. As of this review its only $3.99, Thats nice deal for a classic game.Be warned your going to have to run the patch to get the game to run. If your not comfortable doing this I suggest you pass on buying the game."

It's originally was made for Win 98 and XP patch not always worked. So setting BAT file launcher to admin permission is forgivable for me.Game is FREAKING AMAZING, both it good and bad sense. There is some parts that are outdated more than the poop of the dinosaur, but the gameplay is still AWESOME!Really complaining old good game for 1,3$ - you are insane!

The game still takes 30 seconds to open with a CMD window permanently open in the background while you play... Screenshots doesn't work and the Steam Community doesn't work in game.Now I haven't played this game before, I guess that's an old game that might have been good back then... But I don't even know what i'm looking at.I strongly do not recommend to buy this game if you haven't played it previously and if you did, keep in mind you will spend a good amount of time fixing the game. Don't even ask me how I did it, I don't remember, I've tried many fixes and reinstalled the game twice."

Activly check the games they wish to sell via Steam, and put appropriate warnings in place.And yeah i hear you, they do that already, but to such a lesser degree its laughable, and definitely not activly (enough)Way too many (older) games on Steam have issues with overlay, but Valve/Steam won't warn you about that, or that a game would, for a lot of players, not launch, or crash.You only get that information from the other gamers that already smacked against that wall.Getting so darn sick of companies only purely after money & power, abandoning decency whenever it suits em, and put a tiny freaking band-aid on gushing wounds as positive PR.Now for the full experience, and the very near-future Refund ticket:1) The game wouldn't launch, even after using admin + setting compatibility to win XP Service P32) after sifting through all guides and possible unofficial fixes and patches in the discussion section and online in general, I eventually got the game to launch to the main menu (sometimes), but that’s where it would crash again, or at other times I’d only have the option to ""Exit Game"".Constantly trying to rewrite / patch the ""GameLauncher.bat"" file, to force it to work as every guide / patch tries to do, yields varying results and error messages. But I never got to see or get to actually start the game from its main menu (if I even got to the main menu)3)I’ve checked the Product Website, which yields nothing but generic game info, the Developer website is actually the Product Website, and the (supposed) Publisher, via the “Customer Support Website” doesn’t even have the game in its list of (supported) games."
