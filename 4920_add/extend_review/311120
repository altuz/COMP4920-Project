Don Draper,"The Stalin Subway: Red Veil is an interesting game and if you want to waste $2.39 (it was on sale) like I did, then you should go ahead and get it.Know though, that it is a waste of money and there are better games. For instance, Deadly Premonition is $2.49 at the time of writing, and it is a hundred times better for only ten cents more.Pros:-Average FPS-Sound quality isn't terrible-Graphics get the job done-Unique-ish maps and levels-Has its funny moments which lighten up the mood-Main character sounds sexual when she dies, if you are into that kind of stuffCons:-Bad voice acting-Few weapon choices-All rifles share the same ammunition, but you can only collect the ammunition if you have that specific gun equiped. (EG: if you have an AK, and there are two SMGs on the ground, to collect the most ammo you should drop your AK and collect the ammo, then pick the AK back up.)-Non-intuitive level design - getting stuck is frequent-Enemies always know where you are at all times, and will fire immediately at you when you turn a corner-Too hard, even on easy-No health reset across levels-Resets your guns after the car mission for no reason-Russians carry an American Browning handgun (Why?)-Story is very difficult to follow"
,Recommended,311120,12682231,"Posted: 29 October, 2014",all,LoveJesusHateTheGovernment,"This game is kind of a guilty pleasure for me. I just completed it on normal difficulty and I honestly can't believe that it got released with all the problems the game mechanics have. Everything you can possibly imagine that could be wrong with a first person shooter is done in this game. There is a rail section where you are in the back seat of a vehicle being shot at with no way to dodge or duck. If you start the mission with anything below 100% health, (meaning you have to complete the previous mission with 100% health) than you might as well reload an older save file and start from a previous mission. There is a sewer level where the water rises, but if you stay underwater too long, you lose health. The problem is that the damage taken for lack of oxygen while being under water is accumulative, meaning that if you begin losing health after being underwater for 10 seconds, and you emerge for air after 9 seconds, going back under the water (which is required) will start to hurt you after being submerged for only 1 second. The game finally concludes with what I can only describe as one of the worst escort missions in FPS history. The only good thing I can think to say is that there were no timed missions.Well, the game's not all bad. Let's talk about what they did right. First, the game is short, (a good thing in this case). Second, there is a very convenient quick save and quick load feature, so no check point system. The down side to that is that you will be using the quick save/load feature constantly; sometimes over a dozen times just to get past one corner where soldiers are waiting to ambush you. There is absolutely no skill involved in this game what-so-ever. It is simply a matter of getting past an area, gaining a little bit of advancement, quicksaving, and repeating as you gradually progress little by little. The graphics, while terrible by today's standards and not very good for the standards of its release date, do a very effective job in recreating an oppressive, post-war soviet atmosphere. The game attempted to be accurate by implementing a critical hit system, which means that you can have 100% health, but one bullet in the right spot, (heart, head, ect.) can take it down to almost 0%. And trust me, there is an ocean of bullets flying at you. You'll find that this system works in your favor also as using your sniper weapon, (the most crucial firearm in the game) and zooming in for headshots is the most effective way to kill your enemies. It's a trial and error system that will have you dying A LOT!So why am I recommending this game? One reason: The price. I got this game for two dollars on sale. For that price it was worth it. Do not pay a dollar more for this game. Deep inside of me, there is a perverse, masochistic streak that takes some sick pleasure in an occasional bad game, much like many people find watching a campy, low-budget movie entertaining. Also, I promise you will enjoy the cutscenes. Trust me on this. They are the most poorly translated, horrendously voice-acted cutscenes you will ever see in your life time. I enjoyed them immensely. If you can find this game for a dollar or two on sale, and you have nothing better to do, give it a try."
76561198017975643,Not Recommended,311120,13843156,"Posted: 4 January, 2015",all,Ian Brandon Anderson,"(ignore time on file - this game isn't Steam integrated and I played it by launching its executable directly)This has to be one of the most infuriating games I've ever played. If it was less sadistic it'd just be a mediocre shooter. As it stands it's entertaining to play if you're a glutton for punishment and want the challenge of seeing the game to completion. I cannot say I recommend it, but it can be enjoyed in a weird way. There are certainly a lot worse games you can get on Steam for 74 cents (what this was on sale for).The main difficulty in this game comes from its damage model. On Normal difficulty, a headshot is an instant kill, a body shot takes about 2-5 hits depending on the weapon, then limbs and finally hands/feet do less. This also applies to you, so you will be killed within seconds or instantly if some of the enemies firing machine guns at you from far away get a lucky headshot. Something that's really neat is that there are ricochets, but in practice this just means the enemies mindlessly emptying their 72-round machine guns can kill you when you're behind cover near ricochet-able walls.Another challenge in the game is aiming. The enemies reflexes are amazing and they will start firing before you can get out of cover enough to aim. Occasionally you can angle yourself in such a way that you can fire at their limbs without being seen, and you need to take these opportunities when you can. You cannot use the iron sights on your weapons so long-range combat is difficult even with a rifle. You just have to aim your crosshair for center mass and hope for the best.The enemy AI is, well... non-existent. They run from their spawn positions, if scripted to do so, and then stand in place immediately firing at you when you come into sight, emptying their magazine. There is rarely the opportunity to sneak up on an enemy from the side or behind, so you will have to quickly duck out from cover as they reload and get a few shots off hoping you don't get hit. Defeated enemies will randomly drop first aid kits which restore 10 of your 100HP. Getting shot once can take anywhere from 5-25 so it's very difficult, but necessary to take down most enemies without taking damage. Quick save/load abuse is mandatory.Depending on how lucky you are with combat, the game is about 4-6 hours long. The levels mostly involve close-quarters combat with a bit of obstacles like rooftop ledges or vents (aka ricochet 'heaven'). The game is cruel, so it will sometimes spawn enemies behind you after passing certain points in the levels. There is one vehicle segment and the last two levels in the game are escort missions. These are by far the least enjoyable in the game.The vehicle level is buggy beyond beliefhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=370005033It starts off by you being driven in front of a vehicle with four machine-gun toting enemies. Half of the time they will kill you before you can even get your crosshair over them. The car then stops in a position where two of the enemies are outside of you aiming range, so you have to blow up their vehicle by emptying two AK clips into it. It is a matter of luck if you can do this before the two enemies kill you. Then comes the bugginess... all of the other vehicles in the level seem to have about a 25% chance of spawning correctly. You will then be chased by a rolling tire, which is invulnerable and will crash into your vehicle causing it to explode. If you quick-save and then quick-load multiple times, your game will either crash or sometimes a black car will spawn instead (albeit missing a tire) and you can kill the vehicle before it crashes into you. Thankfully the other invulnerable tires in the level will not cause your vehicle to explode and the level will end. If you should be unlucky enough for a further two vehicles to spawn correctly, there will be eight enemies which you cannot aim at firing at you and killing you. This time you will want to quick-save and quick-load to prevent those from spawning.Apart from the vehicle mission, the game is playable. The escort mission is like a normal level except you have a slow, wounded guy following you. The enemies ignore him and he stays out of the way of their fire, which is nice, BUT every few minutes the game spawns an enemy soldier close to him that runs up to him and empties his machine gun into him. So while you're worried about saving your own skin, cowardly ducking behind cover with an onslaught of four machine guns firing at you, you also have to babysit.On a lighter note, the voice acting is hilariously bad and you occasionally catch soldiers having conversations about you before you engage them. It's a bad game no doubt, but I came in with low expectations and got some enjoyment from it."

,Not Recommended,311120,13657285,"Posted: 27 December, 2014",all,Skops,"The Stalin Subway 2: Red Veil replaces not only protagonist, but also the fun with frustration. Previously in my adventures in the black hole of Orion Games, I enjoyed The Stalin Subway for its schlocky yet, classic approach to FPS games. While the Red Veil shares much in common, the sense of effort is clearly missing in this sequel.GRAPHICS:Exactly the same as its predecessor. Nearly everything here is reused from the original game apart from the HUD. That's not entirely a bad thing, The Stalin Subway/Red Veil isn't a bad looking game, but some new things to look at would have been nice.GAMEPLAY:While the controls and overall gameplay stay the same, Red Veil removes some features from its former glory for... what purpose I don't know. The armor meter is gone, though you think that wouldn't be a problem because SS1 almost never gave you any armor anyway. However, it is sorely missed here. Enemies seem to have extremely inconsistent damage output ranging from 2% of your health, to nearly 100% of your health at any given moment.  This makes each gun fight a roll of the dice, and can possibly leave you with a nearly impossible chance of surviving your next encounter.The enemy AI itself is heavily scripted. Upon spotting you or reaching it's scripted position, the enemies will stand still and unload entire magazines in your direction until they are forced to reload. This is both highly predictable and abusable. It also breaks the entire pace of the game as you spend 5-10 full seconds waiting around a corner listening to 2 men empty their 72 round drum mags at a wall.SOUND:All reused asset here again for gameplay sounds. Guns still sound weak, unfitting to their rugged and powerful real-life counter parts. The soundtrack in Red Veil is actually its brightest spot. There's several tunes in the game that I will put in my playlist shortly. The voice acting is.. Amazing. Really, this is undoubtly worse and just as legendary as the original Resident Evil. Do yourself a favor and find these cutscenes, they'll make your day!STORY:You play as the wife of the original protagonist of The Stalin Subway; Lana Survorova. As an ex-high ranking officer in the KGB, you and your husband are being hunted down by your former employers. Gleb, her husband, is captured and Lana must rescue him before they make their escape from Moscow... That is the entire story.The amount of levels in Red Veil pales in comparison to it's predecessor which had 32 levels. There are just eight, EIGHT missions in the game and it will take you barely over an hour to complete the entire adventure.OVERALL:The Stalin Subway 2: Red Veil isn't a sequel, its a single player expansion. Had I paid more than the $0.82 I did, I probably feel ripped off. Even For fans of the original; it's a short, frustrating, and disappointing experience."

I think this could be Dark Souls in FPS form.First of all, the voice acting, cutscenes, dialouge, and the PLOT are crap.  Absolutely not a buy if you want any of these in a game.  The level design?  It's a joke.  You will constantly find yourself lost in what SHOULD be an easy navigation, with some levels worse than others.  Then there are turret sections...  My GOD!  Yeah, lets make a game where the point is realism and lets make you stand still and have nearly every enemy shoot at you at ONCE.  You will probably die more often here than at any other point in the game (And you still die a lot regardless).However, even for 2006, the graphics and textures are pretty good (thoguh the grenade explosions NEED to change).  The physics are floaty for grenades, but all other weapons deal accurate damage.  The gameplay is difficult, sure, but it is this difficulty that makes it fun for some.  The gameplay is argueably this games saving grace.If you aren't a fan of turret sections, bouncy physics, crashing to desktop, or terrible story, then don't get this game.  If not, then buy it so you can play it for gameplay stuff."

I am pretty sure that this game is impossible to beat on normal or hard and it's one of the few games I would ever absolutely recommend playing it on easy.Wait. I don't recommend you play this at all.Player damage registry is a joke. Sometimes you survive a full machine gunning to the face, sometimes you don't. It's sometimes hard to tell when this game will allow you to survive a situation, and you never gauge how to survive any fire fight. On top of that, the level design makes no sense. One of the level exits is BLOCKED by a bike and you're meant to think you're not supposed to go there.A forced vehicle section is where I cut off and had to refund this piece of garbage. Your vision is locked into a tiny cone and you can barely do anything about the enemies surrounding you. Think that part from Call of Duty 1 but really terrible. At no point did skill feel like a factor and it felt more like I just needed to be lucky to survive - which I didn't.AND THIS IS ON EASYGarbage. Flat out garbage."

The AI however ruins the entire game. They are completely moronic and often just stands still at one spot waiting for you. Their line of sight is also messed up which makes the fire entire magazines into walls when you are on the other side of it. When you do show yourself they notice you and starts to fire at you with pin point accuracy in less than a seconds."

In other games you can sometimes fool AI into walking to a place that is advantageous to you, but this AI will not move and you are forced to face multiple at a time, which causes your health to drop way too fast.

I'm not kidding this game is really short (look at the hours I've played into this game). I'm pretty sure this game is beaten under an hour if someone tries to speedrun this game. Also this game is 95% fine except the game crashes everytime you press the enable music button. Luckily there is a patch to take care of the problem (Look it up on Google. I believe you just have to replace an audio file from the patch to the game and then the enable music button should not freeze/crash the game.).Anyways The Stalin Subway: Red Veil continues off from The Stalin Subway except this time we play as Lena instead of Gleb. We won't see much of Gleb till like the near end of the game. This game is actually not that bad to be honest. The only con(s) I have for this game is Lena doesn't wear body armor like Gleb does on The Stalin Subway, Lena dies too easily, and the voice acting on this game is not great..... I mean I've seen B-Rated movies and B-Rated Horror movies do better voice-over acting than this game.All in all, I recommend this game if you're really interested in The Stalin Subway video games."

And the ""dead pigeon"" model, as well.Second? This had soldiers doing exactly what really would happen in a rooftop chase: running out, going a little too far, windmilling in doomed panic, and falling off the roof. This is the sort of detail I want more of in my games: human error.So all in all, I liked it.

I actually managed to run it fine with the music on but this varies person to person.Again there exists animprovement modfor this game though I have not personally tried it.If the first game didn't win you over this won't either. Even if youdidfind some enjoyment in it (I did) this is an inferior sequel in a great many ways. While the first game made up for its low production values with heart and attention to detail in certain areas (level design, weapons etc) this is just low effort all around. Even treated as more of a standalone expansion or something akin to modern DLC than a sequel it's still poor.Most notably the game isexcessivelyshort. Two hours at most and that includes many, many deaths due to poorly designed difficulty spikes. You will likely not even get all three steam cards in a single playthrough. If you do feel the need to play this game put it on easy as it is unfairly difficult otherwise. Even on easy most of the game is significantly more difficult than hard mode in the first game and this is difficulty of the frustrating/unfair type rather than a test of skill. One rail-shooting segment in a car is essentially uncompletable on normal or hard and a level towards the end, while not overly difficult, involves escorting a massively slow NPC and bored me ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. In addition to the typical problems of forced escort missions the game will spawn enemy soldiers right next to the NPC if you try to move ahead even slightly too quickly.Another large annoyance is the sudden introduction of a weapon limit. Inexplicably the AK47 and PPSh-41 now share an ammo pool despite being different calibres and not doing so in the first game. I can only assume this is a result of cutting a bunch of guns from the first game though three new weapons are added: Molotov cocktails, a new handgun (almost immediately discarded for a better gun due to the aforementioned weapon limit) and a sniper rifle. The last of these is easily the best addition. A single-shot firemode was also added to the AK47 which is nice but still doesn't make up for the loss of the other guns. The game's soundtrack is somewhat of an improvement but that's about it on the positives.The level design is also a step down from the first game. A larger number of dead ends, confusing levels (the starting apartments and one flooded bunker part particularly are poor) and a lack of the destructible objects I enjoyed in the first combined with the limited environments  overall bring the experience down considerably. Enemy placement is worse too though thankfully the invincible path-blocking NPCs of the first game are absent.Finally the voice acting is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. Again compared to the first game this isn't 'so bad it's good' it's just indescribably bad. No effort was put into it and there is no excuse for such a drop in quality. The story in the first game was hardly stellar but at least it consisted of more than just 'lets run away from the antagonist of the last game'. In contrast a poorly explained internal power struggle in the USSR seems inspired.If you still feel the need to buy this game get itverycheap in a sale. Do try the first game out though as it isn't anywhere near as bad."

Unlike the first game, this one does work. And that's a good thing, right?Now with that, now for something completely different.Introduction:*Sigh*....What the flying-circus is this piece of sh!t? I mean, come on! Red Veil dose what it can, but fails at all the rest: Making a good game.Graphics: It dose it job. The Graphics here are dated, but decent...Except for one thing. I don't know either it's my computer or the game, but the textures here keep flickering, even showing some objects as well. Even worst, it kept on flickering and flickering every f***ing time when I move! Again, it dose it job, but it's shotty at best.Sound: Well...Somewhere in this world, Tomlinson Holman and James A. Moorer are sheding a tear with these sound design. Just play it to even believe it's majesty! In other words: It sucks. Also the voice acting...*Faceplams*Gameplay & Controls: Well, the good news is the controls are basic, but fuctional. And that's good. At least you can give all those cheap FPS games a break in the controls, their basic, but good. Well, most of the time. The Gameplay in the other hand...Dear lord. Someone might as well change the title from The Stalin Subway: Red Veil to Survive KGB Gunfire Simulator 2006; Because it is unfair! I mean, the first second of playing the game you're getting shot at by two men with FRIGGIN' PPHS-41s! And you going to die. A lot. In a unfair way. Outnumber. Outgun. Outhope. I know what you thinking, yes. I am fully aware that you are outgun, outnumber, etc. and you have to fight your way through the fire and the flames to win the game, but...At least make it fair. This...I was amused by the quality of the game to get angry at it's Gameplay. Dose that count as a good thing if you get stoned by the quality of the game, instead of it's gameplay? With everything else going wrong, the controls are berly supporting of what seems to be a promising game.Overall: I am glad I played this game. Because at least ONE game works in the The Stalin Subway series. But it fails miserably. I played an hours worth of this game, hoping for a game that's is so bad it's good kind of way, but jezz...Well, at least some good came from this: Controls are basic, but works. Graphics are decent, if isn't flickering. Everything else though, sucks. And, oh yeah. Before I forget, I got two trading cards from this game. One called: Urgent Call, and the other: Will be together again. I sell them both. Urgent call is now worh a penny. But the second one is SUPER, ULTRA,HYPER,UBER,GLORIES,STALINIST rare,and I price it at all-time high of...2 pennies. At least one thing: I got this for only 74 cents. Now I'll need 71 more cents to get my money back.Pros:-Controls are basic, but good-Decent graphicsCons:-Terrible Voice acting-Miserable Gameplay-Flickering graphicsScore: 2/5-Not Recommend"

This is one of these games you shouldn't expect much from, and you rather play them because they are as bad as they are. In this game, the first level is in an apartment building you are supposed to escape from, but I didn't even make it through 2 floors, because the level is too crowded and the health is too low. Then I had the fun experience of realizing that there is no automatic checkpoints, and that the entire intro cutscene plays  everytime you start again. Meaning, that you basically have to start the game from the Main Menu every single time you die.After utilizing the games console and a few commands, I managed to be unbeatable, yet, either none of the doors work, I was running in circles, or the level is just broken. After a while I eventually made it to the next section. After taking more hits than I expected to be tolerated, I realized that I didn't have godmode anymore, and upon my respawn I was back in level 1 because I forgot to create a save file when arriving Level 2. From that point on I never managed to reach Level 2 again.Truly an amazing experience. Only really worth it if you need trading cards to complete the games epic Stalin badge for your steam profile."

The enemy AI aimbots - a problem that existed in the last game, but in this one, it is even one bigger problem - the fact that you cannot lean in this game is what makes you die and die a lot of times, so the most important way to win the game is to Fast Save almost all the time after a firefight (F5 key). Also, why isn´t the music enabled when you play for the 1st time, forcing the player to enable it? Despite that, both the menu music and the in-game music are trash compared to the 1st game.When we look at both of this games, we see again the dialectics in motion, according to Marxist theory, which Stalin himself wrote about (""Dialectical and Historical Materialism""). Stalin Subway is the thesis and Stalin Subway: The Red Veil is the anthesis - but will we have a synthesis? Only time will tell, but me liking the 1st game, I think we need a ""Stalin Subway 3"" (or a remake) to restore greatness to the series and fix the problems from the 2 games.In conclusion: do not buy it, even on special sale period.

Even so, all you need to know is that the only good weapon is the PPSh. The second best weapon is crouching. All you need to do is close in on enemies, then crouch and spray. Bullet richochets are in the game, but unfortunately fairly useless... it just serves to get you killed if you decide to spray across a metal surface. But to be fair, that is why there are enemies with metallic body armour in the game (just like in the first game if I remember correctly), as historically used by some Soviet assault engineers. Other than that, it can be tedious to find the right door or objective to activate... just like in the first game.SOUNDThe voice acting is quite bad. Even now I am unsure if these are actually NA/UK actors hired to do the English voices while trying really hard to use a Russian accent, but failing...ORthat these are actually Russian actors hired to do English voices while trying really hard, but failing. Either way, I don't hate their attempts, but it should be pointed out that the quality of it is just... quite bad. The music, however, is quite good and fits the game well.BUGSNext, the elephant in the room. Elephant-sizedBUGS. To be fair the game itself runs great, it's just... getting it to run at all is the problem for most people. In my case, I can only run it windowed and it refuses to go above 640x480. That definitely made the game more challenging for me, sitting behind a 1920x1200 monitor. Likewise, some people can't play this at all because of their hardware, just getting a white screen at most. It's rather disappointing. There is a fix available on the official Russian site. It's not that hard to find, even if you do not speak Russian, but the problem is that the fix may not actually fix this problem for everyone. It did nothing for me. It's a bit like playing Russian Roulette... either this game will work for you in some way, or it does not.CONTENTRegardless, none of this matters if the content of the game offers excitement. Unfortunately, even I had a hard time to get excited, mostly because of annoying moments like the infuriating ""car chase"". You are supposed to destroy an enemy car or two, but soon two trucks spawn with a lot of enemies that dismount. It seems impossible to kill them before they shred your health. They can shoot you from long range, you cannot crouch; you take hits from enemies in cars, can only turn 90-135 degrees which means enemies can shoot you in the back and you can only shoot the truck soldiers if they are dismounted, which is right before your car turns your back to them. The only way I passed this segment was because I quick-saved and -loaded, which despawned the soldier trucks completely... except for the wheels. Nice.The escort missions near the end are also a pain in the rear. You must escort Glab, the heroine's lover, but if you stray too far from him enemies will spawn to attack him - a quick spree is enough for him to die. Your best bet is to stay nearby, but that means waiting for him to move and since he is wounded, he slowly limps forward. This slowed down a short mission by a lot of time. Glab is also with you in the next level and he now shoots back. The only problem is that if you move towards the end of the final station... you randomly die. This is because that area is final area, you die if you go there early because we can't have invisible walls. Instead, you must go around the train, but a guard covers it from sandbags. Try to shoot him and you will discover he is invincible. I assumed it was intentional, to force the player to wait for the guard to reload until you move up behind cover. As you do so and get behind him, two more guards spawn - allowing you to kill all three. Clever, maybe, but silly. As you make it past them and go inside you find: a window suitable for sniping. Yes, the last segment of the game is covering Glab with a sniper rifle. However, there is one problem... Glab can randomly die from one shot. My best guess is that the AI can randomly make a headshot which grants the same damage multiplier as your shots against enemy AI. Meaning his health bar is pointless. Meaning the end is one big save and load fest.CONCLUSIONThe game is terrible, there is no way around it. But somehow, I still recommend it. Games like this are badly developed, but it does one thing right. It captures the charm of old games, though not at the same level of quality. It doesn't pretend it's the world's most serious work of art. It's also not a shameless cash grab. The game is what it is: a poorly developed FPS that challenges you to beat it once. Unfortunately, this game can be completed under 3 hours or less, comes with a ton of bugs from the moment you try to start it up and is generally not all that great. In fact, when you take into account that you will do quite a bit of savegame loading for cheap deaths or looking for objectives, I'd say the game can be completed in an hour... perhaps less for speedrunners. Despite being older (2006), it is quite a bad apple... but one that can be enjoyed for what it is and be used to fill your lone hours. This supplied me with more joy than stupid copy-paste FPS games we have to deal with these days, despite it being terrible.That doesn't make this game good, this is still a pretty bad game... but it's the type of bad that can be loved. Taking the low price in consideration as well... I do not regret my purchase.I would recommend this game to you ifyou wish for a change of pace in terms of your FPS games and want a short game ""with an old appeal"" to complete.I would not recommend this game to you ifyou seek a game to invest more time in or at least offer you some replayability, or if you are afraid to gamble your money on a game that may not launch for you at all."

On my second attempt, I saw two soldiers fall upon noticing me along with a few other throwing grenades at me while killing themselves with their own grenades. If their was anything I learned while in Soviet Russia, it's that the soldiers are suicidal and strong."

While i give the developers some credit for increasing movement speed, reload speed and trying some new environments, i cannot recommend this game due to the ridicously short length of it. The first one took me several hours to beat, this one took me just over an hour, I was almost in disbelief when it finished, its the same length as a demo."

,Not Recommended,311120,35039635,Posted: 17 September,all,Verdantil,"Tags: 1PS - First Person ShooterAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library (2.2 Gigs)TLDR: TrashThis is the only Buka entertainment product I own that actually launches. The in-game cutscenes are framed oddly, and the voice acting is just insanely amateurish to the point where, in my humble opinion, it nearly crosses over to being good again, except the recording quality is muffled. You wont get to enjoy much of any of the game anyways. The hitboxes for headshots do not much in-game character models so occasionally I would headshot people and they would be unaffected, given the pistol's low rate of fire that is a problem. Especially since this game has no cover system, does not allow you to learn over corners to shoot or even look, and the moment you cross over into visible range, the A.I. auto-aimbots on you and starts firing at a robotic even pace. A.I. never moves at all and stays stationary so there is no way to outsmart their patrol patterns of try to get the jump on them. You can drop medkits randomly which in theory allows you to carve a path of carnage and be constantly healed. However the game also has a clunky inventory system which meant that soon after starting, I was getting constant inventory full messages, and seeing things like doctor bags not getting picked up. That should had been streamlined as it really hurts progression as well. There was no music whatsoever which made the game eerily silent. Altogether I have very little positive to say about The Stalin Subway: Red Veil. Avoid."
