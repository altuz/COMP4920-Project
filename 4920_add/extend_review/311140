,Not Recommended,311140,12208369,"Posted: 23 September, 2014",all,Ahravi the waff,"Make sure to read the whole review, I've changed/will be changing some things.Well, first I/everyone had issues witht he game not even appearing in their library. That's fixed, great? No. Trying to skip the splash screens will crash the game, and upon (kindof) loading into the first level, it's just a black screen, and alt tabbing doesn't work so you have to go to task manager, only to see ""game"" is not responding.Also alt tabbing out of the game and back in breaks it, as in there's a blank window on your screen, and closing said window will still leave a Metro 2 process open which continues playing the menu music until you close it too.Steam, if you want to be like GOG and sell older games, make sure they freaking work.Ok, now that I've finally got it working (by not running the highest resolution, and turning music OFF), it's not that bad of a game. The guns feel ok, despite lack of iron sights. Movement is meh but it works, though there's annoying head bob you can't change. The body physic when people die are ok, everything else is, well... I don't call it Nvidia Physux for nothing...Guns have some kind of ballistics simulation to them. Depending on the surface you shoot at, and the angle, your rounds will richochet, possibly injuring you as well as enemies, which is quite fun and even though I don't see myself using it for anything, it's nice to see.Level design seems kinda meh, I go through the whole level and it's empty, only to go back and find enemies in an area they weren't in before. It seems that you have to go through the semi-open levels in a specific order, so enemies will spawn and other areas will open up.My favorite weapons to use right now are actually the Makarov and the APS, the pistols feel really good to me ingame, though I wish they would shoot faster (yes, APS has automatic mode, but it's burst). And with my limited time on the PTRS41, I like that as well, rounded a corner and turned someone into little chunklets of meat.Overall I'd recommend the game, despite the issue I had, I did get it working, and for a 4 dollar game, it's not bad.I'm still keeping this as not recommended though, simply because of all the issues I had with it. Steam does need to have some quality control, and stop trying to beGOG.com, selling older games that are barely/not even supported, and/or not telling people workarounds to get it working.New additions: After some more time with the game, and replacing the outdated audiere.dll with the newest one, I'm having fun with this game actually. It's definitely worth the 4 dollars, though the trouble I had at the start still deserves a Not-Recommended status.I was spraying at some enemies with the PPSH and the richochets came into play, I killed 3 civvies around a corner with them, oops. Nice to see it effects gameplay somehow.Also be sure to save manually all the time, the autosave didn't save when I went to the next level so I had to redo the last one again. (also because it doesn't restore your health between levels, keep multiple saves so you don't screw yourself over in a bad spot)"

,Recommended,311140,23546678,"Posted: 13 June, 2016",all,Jrgl_Cuchallain,Warning: install the patchhereor the game will not work.Extract the files into the main game folder and overwrite when asked.There also exists animprovement modto tweak the firing sounds of the weapons and improve the translation but it's fairly obscure and I have not personally tried it. Notably it also changes some of the music used in game.The Stalin Subway is a slightly wonky mid-2000s shooter that still manages to be reasonably entertaining due to an under-represented setting and a fair bit of heart. The stereotype of the under-polished slavic game holds true with this one and the voice acting/translation is so bad it starts to get good.The soundtrack is mostly generic but occasionally somewhat catchy when it actually ♥♥♥♥ing plays. The menu theme and the first level theme (actually a modern version of a fairly well known Cold War era song) particularly stand out.There was a degree of thought put into the weapons used in the game. They both fit the time period and those of the same calibreactually share the same ammo poolwhich is a nice touch. The rifles did feel a little underpowered but the rest were fine. Additional features absent from modern AAA shooters like destructible objects and ricochets from missed shots (which can actually hit NPCs or even youself on occasion) were unexpected in such a budget title but also welcome.Probably worth the price asked and certainly worth picking up on sale it gives 6 hours or so of mildly confusing entertainment. Some degree of challenge can be had if you put it on hard though this will depend on player skill. Bunny-hopping is recommended due to the slow walking speed.Avoid the sequel (Red Veil) like the plague. You have been warned.

First off, there are a lots of technical problems about the game, but i am not sure what is causing this, perhaps my system is different, or not fully supported, i had black and too bright textures too, also there was long loading times if i wanted to go main menu, game has been stopped for 20-30 seconds, also had some adventures under the graphics, and for this, sys components are not an excuse.There was some atmosphere in a few maps, but usually they were repetitive and poor looking, game lacks of open areas, there is about 2 of them, one is near the story's start, one is at the Kreml, as far as i remember thats all. Character models also looks the same, there is about 5 total.The menu is so oldschool, no extra useless options, however, naturally the multi player is dead, but this isn't a problem.The menu's music is f*cking awesome, big cheers goes to Julia Lytkina for that, instant fav for me. Some maps have good tracks too, there are also cheap boring tracks, nevertheless the music is a big advantage in my scoring.I'd gladly recommend almost all the games that focusing for Singe player story, because we are lacking them these days. TSS's game time is around 7-8 hours in single player, which makes the game worth for a buy on a highly depressed price."
,Recommended,311140,13641098,"Posted: 27 December, 2014",all,Skops,"Stalin Subway comes to us from Orion Games, the same people who gave us the ""gem"" that was Dusk-12. And because of that, The Stalin Subway comes with all of the same technical issues of Dusk-12. Fortunately, this time around the games forums were very helpful in providing fixes and I could enjoy this game without too much hassle.Speaking of which, enjoy this game I did! The Stalin Subway is a great classic shooter.Graphics:Nothing too amazing here, but nothing awful either. In comparison to their other effort, Dusk-12, The Stalin Subway actually looks better. None of the models look too stiff and the game runs fine without too many hiccups. However, in some of the Metro levels the games engine has some... interesting ways of showing shiny reflective surfaces.Gameplay:Classic FPS like Quake/Doom etc. You got health/armor meters (though it seems armor drops are extremely rare) and a plethora of guns to use. You can't sprint in the game, but if you want to get across the level quickly you can just jump strafe to victory for a lightning quick way to get down long corridors.Sound:Re-used gun sounds from DUSK-12 so all the guns sound pretty weak and rather unsatisfying to shoot. With a new Audiere.dll file, I actually got to hear some music while I played this, and it wasn't bad at all.Story:You play as Gleb Suvorov, a KGB liutenant. On a routine shift in a secret base, KGB Officers begin an insurrectection against Stalin. The plan on blowing up Moscow with an atomic bomb. It's your job to track down the traitor of the Motherland and stop the bomb!Pretty simple, and enjoyably shlocky. Stalin himself appears in FMVs but, he doesn't seem to have any idea whats going on or even when he does, not all that concerned about it. The voice acting is pretty brutal here, and a lot of mistranslated lines which kind of adds some charm to it.Other Stuff:Back on the armor thing.. I find it weird that you have an armor meter and start the game 100 Armor, but I only once found any armor thoughout the game. It's like the devs just forgot about armor drops. Either way, it's not a hassle since most enemies drop health items and you shouldn't have too much trouble getting through the game.Overall:The Stalin Subway is a rootin' tootin' Soviet shootin' good time.. GET IT."
,Recommended,311140,16931677,"Posted: 7 July, 2015",all,KDD!^agof,"Old and rather junky FPS with some hardcore mechanics, like rhytm-jumping and ricocheting. Narrative is sketchy - it's nice that you are playing flashbacks but out of body experience and changes of protagonists rarely fit the FPS genre; story itself is weak. Graphics are rather good, while animations and voice-acting are trashy. But music is god-tier.The most mixed thing is level-design. First half of the game consists of same corridors, same underground stations (but unlike ones from Metro 2033 these are realistic and pretty ones, and not copypasted brown dumpsters full of hobos, so there is some local flavour there) and same train segments, which remind of similar level from unreal tournament. While they are really fitting thematically they are very linear and boring. Later levels are more complex, but still, overall game is full of unclear objectives and boring fetches in semi-linear and samey labyrinths. Though sometimes developers really tried to do everything right. Sheer dullness of these levels made me nostalgic for unreal, and i don't even like that game.Technically it's stable and works on modern systems, but resolution is capped, alt-tab freezes the game and it can't be played on surround.It's ok. At least not another console soapy movie. Still it drags on a little too long."

If you skip the opening credits to the game, it crashes. If you minimize the game, it crashes. If you try to bring up steam or xsplit overlay in the game, it crashes. When loading or starting a game, there is a 50-50 chance the game will crash. Same with when you die in the game.Modeling in the game is extremely lazy. All characters I have seen have been one of about 5 variants.The AI is awful as well. Enemies will be standing about 5 feet away from a firefight and not notice. Enemies will rush you for no real reason.The level design is also complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ After advancing to the second floor in the game, I was completely unable to figure out where to go next. There were a multitude of completely empty and useless rooms with no real apparent reason for them to be there at all. While the attempt to create an expansive map is appreciated, really it just adds to player confusion and doesn't improve the quality of the game. Not to mention the huge vent system, which, when I explored to see if it was the way to progress from the second floor, took me back to the start. Why such a pathway leading back in the game was included  to begin with eludes me.I bought this game with the knowledge that it would be awful, and played it because I knew it would be bad. I played for comedic purposes. Anyone seeking a different kind of experience should steer clear of this game."

If you can even run it, you'll be treated to a mess of a game that can be described as Half-Life: Cheeki Breeki. It's fun if you enjoy laughing at bad games, at least.What sets it apart from all the other junk on Steam is that it was apparently (apparently) made by professional developers, and that it was released on the platform in 2014, two years after Steam Greenlight made its debut but a little before it really started to stink up the storefront.The only consolations are that it has trading cards for some reason, there are patches available to make it run better than a turtle flipped on its shell - and that its sequel Red Veil, also on Steam, is even worse. Buy them if you're a masochist. You know, like me.Incidentally, this is yet another reason I'd like to see a ""mixed"" option for Steam reviews. Stalin Subway merits a thumbs up if you're a bad game connoisseur likemoi, but a thumbs down for almost anyone else who isn't chronically bored and/or addicted to the FPS genre."

I would say that designers job is really something to be recognized, top notch I'd say.The plot is somehow naive but at least acceptable (usually all stories about SU make me feel sick, but this one surprisingly didn't). Cutscenes are a little bit of 'meanwhile in Soviet Russia' but they didn't bring the whole thing too far to make it irritating. The idea behind is rather interesting but got mediocre when realized in the game.Physics is good except for some jumping / crouching issue of the protagonist, which you'll find much unusual should you've played more than a couple of FPS of last decade. And you can't run, even sprint a little.Also I had to download and install manually the patch to get the game stable and to make lots of textures finally visible (seems to be at least strange by today standards). I've seen the shadow only once despite all related features were enabled. Rather weird for final release I suppose.Sound is good but volumes are not balanced somehow: the alarm ringing will make you feeling like turning the sound off.Also I had to disable the music, otherwise the game crashed each time I press ESC.Gameplay is more or less OK, but action is not as intense as I'd like to have it.So, the best you have here is design and graphics, but the rest is so much generic or mediocre. May be more intense action could tilt the shift and considering great design you wouldn't care about the rest of features being so average, but it just didn't happen.What we see is the leader who didn't make it to the place it was meant to occupy.Consider the stuff above, check the price tag and make your mind. I don't regret about the price I paid, but I've abandoned the game on the 3rd level, since I've lost my interest to it completely."

For me, there's some sort of charm to this game, one that I can't really describe. Playing with friends made it better, since we enjoyed laughing at all the game's flaws and inaccuracies. In the end, it's a sort of guilty pleasure game.Yes, the textures are crappy at times, and the voice acting is pretty bad, but that's all part of the charm. It's a game to be made fun of, while blasting away rouge KGB and GRU forces.Please note: I understand that this game has problems when you first start it up, my suggestion (and the one that fixed the crashing glitch) is to disable music. After that it was smooth sailing..or rather subway riding for me.Would I recommend it? I suppose I do, but even for this low of a price, I'd say wait for the sales.However, for the love of god, don't bother with this game's sequel.

,Recommended,311140,14392868,"Posted: 8 February, 2015",all,Bony Boprano,"Yes, somehow, I do recommend this game.Do not buy it for 4 dollars - get it on sale, or do what I did and sell a lot of useless trading cards and pay for it that way.I really wanted to try this game because I have an affection for low-budget, early 2000's shooters.  There's just some sort of weird charm to them that makes them interesting to play.But enough of that: let's get the bad out of the way.The Bad- Crashes at random points.  Seriously: for absolutely no reason at all, the game will crash.  On the other hand, it only takes about 30 seconds to start the game and load your last save, so that's not too big an issue.- You either have to turn off the music, or replace the .dll file.  There's no way around it.  The cheaply produced, off-European tunes are actually somewhat catchy, so I recommend replacing the file.- You can't skip through the splash screens, or your game will crash.  Whatever.- No widescreen support.- Currently, I'm having some wonky texture glitches that make random parts of the floors and walls just completely black.  Not sure how to fix that.  There is also a plethora of other graphical bugs and glitches as well.- There's only about three or four enemy character models.- Not quite sure what the story is about (not that I care).  It appears to be some sort of insurrection inside the post-World War 2 KGB?  You're a KGB agent and you're killing other KGB agents.  Or Chekists.  I don't know.- Absurdly difficult, even on normal.  However, this is countered by the massive amount of ammo drops in crates everywhere, so you're never short on bullets.- Speaking of, it takes a lot of bullets to take down enemies.  It's fine, because the cheesy animations and decent physics sort of counteract the fact that you just sank an entire AK magazine into one guard.- There's probably more I could say, but this is what I dragged up.Now, the good.The Good- The voice acting is so terrible that it's hilarious.  Seriously - you'll have a good time listening to cutscenes and whatnot.- Guns are pretty satisfying.  Decent list of weapons at your disposal.  Sound effects are cheesy and low-budget, but what do you expect.  The Shpagin is probably my favorite: straight up spraying bullets everywhere is pretty fun in this game.- For an older low-budget game, the graphics aren't too shabby.  You get what you pay for.- I actually really dig the effects - destruction, physics, etc - in this game.  Sure, it's no Havok or Euphoria or whatever, but the setpieces are pretty nice.  Ricocheting bullets, shattering glass, blowing out portions of the floor and wall, etc.- Just a good time, Russian shoot 'em up.So, in short, yes, the game is plauged with technical errors and glitches.  But if you can pick it up for cheap, and you're looking for a straightforward shooter, then this isn't your worst bet."

In« The Stalin Subway»you play as KGB officer Gleb, who gets involved in a conspiratorial plan in Moscow of the early 1950's. Some regime enemies plan to kill Stalin by detonating a nuclear bomb in his personal bunker in Moscow. As heroic Gleb it's now up to you to save that mass-murderer's♥♥♥♥♥and the whole population of the city from getting pulverized.Of course you do so in blowing away « traitors» and other dubious henchmen.

I liked the assortment of weapons, the overall concept of the game, and also trading cards, however the cons outweighed the pros. Some levels are literally a copy-paste job, textures are bleak, and the enemies are ragdoll clones that sometimes fly around the room with only a few shots fired at them. The English translations were wrong multiple times and the voice acting was cheesy.

It's because the game isn’t fun to play. The gameplay is clunky and slow, the weapons are in some cases fine, and in other cases awful, and probably the biggest problem is the enemies do to much damage. This forces you to be what I like to call a corner creep (when you have dart back and forth from a corner) just to kill anyone. This makes an already slow game just really unbearble to play.
