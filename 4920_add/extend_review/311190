At first I was taken a back by the art style. It looked a little off to me. But I looked past it and started playing. The game controls and plays well. I never felt cheated by the controls. This game also has some amazing depth to it. It has different power up elements, funny diolog, and a unique gameplay style all its own.  I'm only an hour in but it has been fun."

It takes a tried-and-true formula and just does it right. It is *nearly* flawless in that regard. The controller support is good and everything is tight. It is very addictive. The place it falls short in my mind is with a very high difficulty spike with the boss battles. Honestly that is the only reason I never finished it.Pros:+DoesMetroidVaniaoh-so right!+Controls are tight and it just plays great overall.+Super addicting.+Too cheap.Cons:-Boss battle difficulty spikes were the reason I couldn't finish it.Totally worth full price, and should be in any indie game enthuisiasts library."

The controls feel smooth and tight, you jump nicely, movement is responsive.  Gameplay is a combination of questing, platforming and fighting.  You level up and spend skill points, get items, relics, power ups and unlock new skills.  The story line is great.  I love this game.  The only problem is when is the next one coming out?9.99/10"

It's nothing ground-breaking or hugely innovative, it's just a Generally Solid Video Game. The art and writing are both kind of adorably naff.The only actually bad thing I really have to say is that the bosses are pretty sharply harder than the rest of this otherwise easy game and not in a good way, they're all basically just flat DPS checks for if you've collected enough upgrades, it's kind of a lame flow-breaker but otherwise it's a pretty damn solid video game that costs absolutely nothing.Waaaaaaaay better than it looks.

My unversal generic control works brilliantly, and the controls have been perfect thus far.  This game has kept me entertained, the plot is just enough and there is an adventurous feel.  There are enough little secrets on the side to add a puzzle aspect without being overwhelming.  I usually have a problem when games seem to give me ""the runaround""  but things move rather quickly in this game.  My main complaint so far is that the combat is a little too easy and one dimensional.  I would almost prefer jumping on turtle heads rather than wielding a sword."

As a 2D RPG Platformer it excells. It has a very bright and childish feel but I still enjoyed it as a young adult. There's a feel of sarcasm and hinted adult humor. So suddle you may not even notice. Which I love to see. I do recommend for young children regardless. There are a lot of puzzles and it can be very challenging. It's all about getting Fu the best gear, items and leveling up his stats to ensure he can survive. Characters are cute and fun to engage yourself with. Though the plot is pretty traditional. With the hero who goes through a huge ordeal to save a damsal. But it makes it feel classy somehow. Don't know if it's because their Panda's or because Fu is so innocent and really just wants everyone to be happy.This is the kinda game where you unlock new abilites or items so you can gain access to new areas. So there is some back tracking involved. But I didn't really mind. It is simple but well built, I really do suggest you play this game. It is enjoyable and the hours roll on by when your playing. Go for it!"

,Recommended,311190,28353782,"Posted: 13 December, 2016",all,PandaFraHelvete,"Don’t be fooled by the looks and childish image of this game, for you will have a nice time due to the amount of fun and secrets it holds.Super Panda Adventures is one for those games that should be tagged as a “Hidden Gem”, while the story is not that original at all, its value is easily found on the mechanics, gameplay and partly RPG elements, the 2D and immature-like but intelligent design made of this game a total surprise to me.StoryWe play as Fu, a panda, trained to protect a princess, a princess that happens to be abducted by evil robots from outer space and whose evil plans of taking over earth and turn everything into mechanical beings are their final goal. So the young panda facing this threat looks for a way to rescue the princess, save his land and destroy this evil.Gameplay and mechanicsThe mechanics are quite simple and follow the classic 2D elements of gameplay, but what makes this game rich is the amount of well hidden secrets and powers we can have at hand to advance further in the storyline and into more difficult enemies to beat. During the game we should face a limited number of side quests that will lead us to gain more powers, abilities and weapons. In the beginning we are quite underpowered, but this changes shortly after doing some special side quests, enemies are quite tough to beat and we must level up fast, grinding is key to the mechanics for we must develop the many skills we have.Also, to add more fun to the gameplay, there are certain relics scattered all over the different levels, these relics will grant you individual abilities that are very helpful to achieve certain tasks, some of them are easy to find, some others are really difficult, adding more hours of gaming.What was a surprise on this game is the fact that we must come and go over and over again to different locations of the map, a reminder of the old school Zelda games, A Link to the Past to be precise.Soundtrack and soundIt is normal to expect midi elements and 8-bit music, the soundtrack is quite interesting, from high-tempo tunes to slow ones, fitting the atmosphere and aesthetics of the many places we visit.On the other hand the sounds are very old-school like, many of the sound and effects have this vibe that reminded me of Kirby, Super Mario, Zelda, etc. classic NES and Super NES titles. It also has some sort of Super Meat Boy atmosphere at times.The bad but not seriousI must say I encountered not a single bug or glitch and not even a crash, the game runs good, it is stable and smooth. But my complaint goes in the direction of the grinding, it is an important part of the game, enemies are hard to beat when you start, and it becomes easier once you gather enough powers and level up, while the grinding of enemies works this way, it tends to be repetitive and monotonous at times and it is also linked to the fact that every time the same enemies will re-spawn at the same place over and over again, this affected me at times in the beginning, not enough health, not enough manna or shields and many deaths were part of this re-spawning system.Another aspect that many players complained about is related to the boss fights, in my case I did not have any problems with them, but sometimes I felt that they were really hard to beat on normal difficulty, I learnt that some patches changed some aspects of this, but still, I can’t but feel some sort of drawback at some point. Nothing that serious though.Finally, my last complaint and maybe the most annoying is related to the many secrets, sometimes there is not a certain way to know if you visited x part of a level because nothing seems to indicate that you were already there, this happened to me many times. The levels tend to reset what you already did before while discovering new zones. I often found myself running around confused thinking or doubting if I already did x thing or not due to the fact that some locations must be visited many times.ConclusionSuper Panda Adventures is a game that has more pros than cons, evidently. The game highlights the many good things that 2D games have to offer, even more today with all the AAA titles and the masses demanding state-of-the-art graphics and effects, forgetting and proving that simple and classic looking games can deliver the same amount of fun or even more sometimes. I recommend this game to any fan of 2D style that likes games with simple and dumb humor; SPA is a great game that stands out by being original and fun.I urge the developer to deliver more games like this; you have potential, my friend. I can’t wait for a sequel!"

It's a cheap game but actually very addicting, with a nice leveling system, great powerups you need to reach places you couldn't reach before (a bit like Super Metroid).

It has tight controls a bit like Rogue Legacy or Ninja Gaiden (but without the knockback when hit).  You have story quests as well as optional quests to acquire valuable items.  Just beginning so the actual story is fairly new to me, but seems like your on a mission to save the Princess from terrible robots.  Nothing negative to report as of first two hours.  Definitely worth picking up."

The music is delicious, the art is clean and consistent, and the gameplay is quite diverse.You go into the game getting a bit of backstory and some nice visuals which clearly portray the world you've been dropped into. You have your base abilities presented to you immediately, aaaand then you see some blocks you can't yet interact with—a glowing orb floating only a foot beyond. The exciting thought creeps into your mind, ""Yep, this is a metroidvania.""Every new item you discover makes exploring and backtracking all the easier, whether the new item you've discovered required the former item in order to be obtained or not. You've got a level system, with experience pickups as well as experience gained based on your combo counter, not killing, which is definitely a quirky, fresh concept you don't really see nowadays. Leveling up is quite crucial, however collecting a certain collectible is all the more powerful. Basically what I'm boiling down to is that you are not required to collecteveryitem to beat the game—but the nature in which the items and their collection are presented will entice you to 100% it.There are multiple difficulties, the hardest of which,Ridonculous, doesn't really show its effects until you're fighting a boss, where it shines in hellish delight. There are some ever slight, ever rare bugs here and there, but overall it's an extremely stable game.In order to complete the game, getting all collectibles, on Ridonculous difficulty, it took me 11 hours in game time, 19 hours real time. For $4.49 CAD, I feel Super Panda Adventures exhibits a tremendous amount of value. I'd recommend this to any platformer-brawler-exploration-delicious gamers who like the idea of a little panda with a small sword and big dreams."

Many of the trademarks of the Metroidvania genre are missing from this exploration platformer: the game is divided into distinct levels connected on an overworld map rather than being one large area to explore and upgrades are obtained exclusively (unless my memory fails me) by progressing the plot and talking to characters. No finding items in the world naturally and, most unfortunately in my opinion, no easy sequence breaks in sight. Quite simply, Super Panda Adventures is a pretty bad Metroidvania game.But it's a pretty awesome exploration platformer.Don't let the (intentionally) ""bad"" graphics and cheesy storyline/writing fool you, this game has some serious quality to it. The controls are tight, the platforming is solid, and the combat is simple-yet-fun. There is an RPG-inspired level system that allows you to choose new traits to upgrade every time you level up and your equipment can also all be upgraded through the use of certain collectables hidden throughout the world. It's an absolute blast to play and I found myself returning to different areas again and again each time I got a new ability just to see if I had missed anything.I called the art ""bad"" up there, but the use of scare quotes was intentional. The art is very simple and, in all honesty, could have been made in MS Paint. There's a lot of character in the simple character sprites, though. Fu, the titular Super Panda, narrows his eyes when he attacks and smiles with glee when he jumps. The enemies all have very smooth animations and are all unique and varied. The NPCs, on the other hand, are literally never seen moving. It's a shame, but walk cycles can be a pain to animate. The art was done in this style on purpose and it achieves a very specific mood. Is it the highest quality art available? Not by any means. Is it good art? Absolutely insofar as it does precisely what it should.The plot and writing are of a similar quality as the art: seemingly bad, but done so on purpose. Super Panda Adventures plays out like a childrens' book or perhaps a Saturday morning cartoon. The world is simple, but it's supposed to be. And, honestly, if you want epic storytelling in your $4 video game about swordfighting pandas, I think you might have problems. It's cute and endearing and, after a while, I barely even noticed how simple the writing was. Much like the art, it serves a purpose and creates a mood because of its simplicity, not in spite of it.The music is bangin' awesome. There's a reason it's for sale as DLC.The ONLY negative thing I have to say about this game is in regards to its few boss fights. In short: they're bad. At the time of writing, I still haven't finished the game simply because the final boss fight is just too hard for all the wrong reasons. The game conditions you to make use of a semi-reckless run-n-swing fighting style, only stopping to bring up your shield briefly to block an attack before continuing to carve a swath of desctrution through the enemies in your path. The boss fights, on the other hand, are slow and methodical exercises in pattern recognition and patience. Don't expect the next Super Metroid Ridley or Symphony of the Night Dracula here. Hell, I'd take Mario 3 Bowser over some of these. Luckily, there are few boss fights in the game and they can be overcome eventually. I'm sure I won't need more than a couple more swings at the endgame before I finish up."

76561198014860773,Recommended,311190,14508125,"Posted: 16 February, 2015",all,Outside Out,"Super Panda Adventures was a surprisingly enjoyable throwback platformer that I couldn't put down once I'd started.  Anyone with a love of the genre, and particularly those who enjoyed early PC platformers, will find a lot to like here. Your objectives are laid out in a multi-quest fashion, and levels are not beaten but rather explored in parts to achieve these missions. The levels are not particularly numerous but they are vast, to the point that you will still find yourself on unknown paths on your 3rd or 4th visits. These replays are also enhanced by a Metroid-like collection of upgrades combined with a classic colored-key system that provides for a persisent sense of exploration alongside a growing feeling of power and mobility.There are no inconsequential collectibles, everything that doesn't fill a meter either directly makes Fu stronger or is money which can be used to  buy additional experience. After a semi-casual 8 hour playthrough I did not hit the level cap, and expect it would take a long time to do so. I think a normal player will likely only acquire about half of the skill points it would take to fill everything out, so your choices in this regard do matter (to the game's credit). They may matter more than you expect though, as there are a few boss fights which unexpectedly and dramatically shift into a much higher difficulty than the levels themselves. 3 different bosses each required several attempts from me and forced me to adapt to a more ""pro"" block-oriented combat style, and while I felt a satisfying sense of achievement after each, a more casual player might find these to be too much of a challenge to proceed.The plot and dialogue are kid-friendly but also dryly amusing for an adult, poking light fun at various game tropes and dashed with a touch of real warmth. The interface is almost perfect with tight controls (bolstered by a nice built-in joystick/gamepad mapping feature), an excellent all-in-one character inventory/menu, and a comfortably traditional HUD. My only interface complaint is that there is no way to tell from the overworld which keys or collectibles you already have in each level, leaving a bit too much to memory. The music is excellent throughout (though after repeat level visits may wear thin for some). The game's art is done in a simple but charming low-res hand-drawn style with a nice variety of theme and color. The levels are distinct and pretty, though the overworld maps are a bit crude and flat (perhaps also in homage to the oldies?).All told, Super Panda Adventures is a great little indie platformer at a great little price.

I personally don't think the graphics are bad but lets be honest here, they are not exactly 'modern' are they? They look like they were drawn in MSpaint and I have drawn assets in MSpaint for games, and they looked to be about this quality but if graphics are the only gripe then so be it because the game does so many thingsright!You play as a *spoiler alert* panda named Fu. Despite the seemingly obvious route this might take, no, he does not know kung fu. Instead he has a sword and you slash badguys. See? This game is tricky as it lures you in and then sucker punches you with a fist made of awesome.At its core the game is a platformer with plenty of combat thrown in but the combat engine isn't deep. Instead it serves to keep you entertained as you progress from point A to point B and it works really well. Killing numerous enemies in a row will perform a combo chain and the bigger the chain the more bonus exp you get which means you will oftenwantto blaze though areas as rapidly as possible, killing everything in your path, to maximize exp.It is a fantastic design decision because the game does feature backtracking but it never feels like a chore because killing things and making long combos is fun. Good game design at its finest.Gain enough exp and you can place them inside a skill tree. In some ways this game reminds me of Alex Kidd in monsterland, featuring stores, coins, secret areas, the ability to upgrade weapons and armor all that good stuff. You also have a shield which you activate by holding down and the shield will trigger your invincibility frames making it very useful to actually use it! Whilst the game doesn't enforce its roleplaying elements down your throat with complex and confusing trees, you will apprechiate the various options as they are all actually useful and you will look forward to leveling up.The music? Amazing. You can buy the soundtrack as additional DLC and while I leave that choice upto you, as you play through the game you will really apprechiate the music.Sound effects? Eeeeh, something ""borrowed"", something blue. Those are lines from an old wedding jingle but I found it appropiate because sadly you are going to reconize some of the games sound effects and like the graphics they are 'functional' but it detracts from the game instead of enhancing it. Yes the game has coins you collect, now what sound do they make? What is a suitable coin collecting sound, from say, a well known franchaise, like Mario?! So I do have to mention little niggles like that because while I do heap praise on this game, it is by no means perfect.Then their are the tangible things like the story, the game throws memes in and usually when someone does this it is because they lack any original humour but this game is genuinely funny and on rare occassions it even manages to make dead, overused memes actually funny again whih is a feat in itself I might add! Humour is subjective and it is rare for a game that is not a visual novel to feature writing that actually makes me laugh, so very well done for not only managing to fit great writing into a platform game but in also managing to be genuinely funny too.As for playlength, the game is deceptively long without overstaying its welcome. The game is clearly trying to tell a story and while it does pad out the gameplay length with backtracking the game is long enough on its own merits to be value for money despite the budget price.I don't have a youtube video link for this game as most of you who read reviews, actually hate links to youtube within them, but I recommend you watch a video or two and see if the graphics are a deal breaker or not for you. The gameplay the controls, the content, it is all there and it is really good! But you have to look at a game in order to play it and that may just be a deal breaker for some of you.If you prefer gameplay over graphics though then this game belongs in your steam library and you should be playing it!Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews"

You know the drill: puzzles often span multiple levels, and many zones cannot be accessed until later in the game when certain powers have been acquired, often from boss fights or completing quests for NPCs, resulting in lots of backtracking and exploration. Fortunately, every enemy encounter grants experience that can be used to deck out your kit the way you like (upgrade the shuriken ASAP. TRUST ME)Don't let the cartoonish presentation fool you; this is a very challenging ""metroid-vania"" style game. Challenging, but fair."

The different spells will help with is good because some games have extra abilities that do nothing. probably the worst things about Super Panda Adventures is the backtracking when playing and that you can't really play to long without getting bored.SoundI don't normally play with sound so I can't really give my thoughtsLengthIt's a pretty long game and that could be in part because you don't really know what missions you are meant to do if you just want to finish the game without 100% the game. 100% this game is something I haven't been able to do yet but I can tell it will be a whileConclusionIt's a fun game if you like the sound of this from the review, it's cheap $5 isn't asking much, and it's super fun, and something I forgot until now is that (besides the sound) it is made by one person!

I cannot recommend this game enough!Music: The soundtrack in this game is absolutely incredible. You will definitely remember many of these tunes well after you've finished playing the game. Most of the tunes fit their respective areas quite nicely and don't feel out of place.Story: Perhaps the weakest point, but by no means terrible. You are basically a panda trying to save his village and the princess. Along the way you will meet many friends with some funny dialogue, but ultimately you don't get any real attachment to the characters. That said, if you follow similar tastes to myself, this point does not bother you so much, and you are really here for the gameplay.Gameplay: This is the greatest aspect of game. The game follows what most call a Metroidvania style exploration, which because of this game I have grown to love. Movement feels extremely smooth and fast and becomes incredibly fun to master once you learn more skills. Learning how your foes will attack and adjusting your fighting style to the situation feels very rewarding (especially on the hardest difficulty, you can really get a bite taken out of your health if you don't adapt!).The game allows you to distribute stat points earned from level-ups, making it possible to do multiple runs of the game trying a different primary fighting style. You can go all out offensive, or try to be defensive, or a fine mix of both, it's all up to you! One thing to note is you cannot fill in every skill, so I definitely recommend focusing on a single style of fighting.There is also a weapon/armor upgrade system based on finding a certain item throughout the world. By collecting enough of this item, you may spend it to upgrade one of your two weapons or your armor. Again, this adds some replayability as you can choose to focus your level ups on damage and then focus your collectable upgrades on armor, or maybe go all out damage on the weapon.Difficulty: The game presents you with multiple difficulty options, which is fantastic for all types of players. If you want a decently hard game, this game delivers. If you want a nice casual run through the game to explore the mechanics, you can absolutely do that as well and not be so punished for taking a hit.Almost every run of this game (including my very first run) was done on the hardest difficulty. I absolutely recommend this, as being able to master this game feels so rewarding. Your decisions and quick reflexes make a huge difference in the outcome of your battles, ESPECIALLY the boss battles. These are some of the most intense fights that may make you want to slam your controller to the ground, but ultimately you realize that there is so much you can do to improve your chances next time you attempt. When you finally triumph, it feels so satisfying.Final thoughts: TL:DR I consider this game to be one of my favorite games of all time, and I abolutely recommend purchasing it. You have no reason not too, just look at this price! $3.00 for one of my favorite games of all time? Heck yes!"

76561198039070414,Recommended,311190,15481288,"Posted: 21 April, 2015",all,Milanimae,"The Short: A solid metroidvania with RPG elements and a decent number of collectibles. Good graphics & sound. Simple but meaningful upgrade system with several styles of play. Gameplay is generally unchallenging yet fun, but the few bosses in the game are substantially more difficult. Suggested buy at $5 or less.The Long:1) Gameplay: it's a 2d platformer with rpg elements, so you should have certain expectations going in. Levels are accessed from an overworld, and, in the mode of many games in this genre, you will find yourself returning to old levels with newly gained powers in order to access new areas and gain new items. There are a decent number of collectibles in the game, and it will probably take you 10-15 hours to find them all without use of a guide.The general gameplay is fairly unchallenging on normal, though I have yet to try harder difficulties. There are many abilities which increase survivablity to the point where you won't even worry much about getting killed from mid-game on. There are not very many enemies in the game, either, and you will have their attack patterns memorized fairly quickly.The very significant exceptions to the above statements are the boss battles. The bosses are few in number, but I had significant difficulty with all of them; they clearly represent a substantial increase in difficulty relative to the rest of the game. They were my main motivator for finding all of the extra powerups.2) Graphics and sound: I'm not much of a buff on either of these things, but I was happy with both. The music is very pleasing, and the graphics look clean and well-done. I am glad that this game, unlike so many other classic-style games, did not use classic-style graphics that looked like they were ripped from RPGMaker.3) RPG elements: I would classify this game as having ""soft"" RPG elements. While you do level up and it is important for progression, there is no pressure to pick the right skills to advance each time. You will get 2 points to spend after each level up on 1 or 2 skills of your choice. These skills can be roughly divided into melee, ranged, magic, and general, but I personally ended up using a little of each. As I said, you will not find the game becoming unbearably hard if you pick some skills before others. The bosses are going to be difficult regardless of the skills you choose, and while some some of them can make these fights easier, your reflexes and your ability to not get hit will matter a while lot more.Those are the major points I wanted to make. Overall, this is a fun little game that's defnitely worth at least a few bucks. My suggested buy price is $5 or less."

,Recommended,311190,15663902,"Posted: 2 May, 2015",all,Radioactive,"This game has surprised me. Despite what the graphics would suggest, it's a polished experience. The controls feel right and smacking down enemies for exp and the heck of it is fun.This game is also good at giving a feeling of progress. You gain more skills over the course of the story at a pretty steady pace. And you gain exp with which you get level ups and skill points to level up abilities of your choosing.I also find the level design in particular overall pretty great! The story requiring you to revisit almost every one of them multiple times never made me get bored of any of them. Apart from being simply very well designed, the maps also have goodies in them that you can grab once you got more skills from the story - so you have something to do on revisits. An old recipe, but it works well for this game.I also never had much problem navigating them despite the absence of a minimap. Every area in a level looks more or less unique and quite easily identifiable.I feel that there is one problem with this game, and that is that the bosses usually seemed pretty tough to me. They were often quite a bit harder than is actually enjoyable. They have so much health, and in my case, most of the skills that I had picked were are useless or really quite weak against them. I needed to grind level ups more than once to not have to play quite so perfect to win.I still liked practically everything else - this was a fun game to play through!"

The combat is very simple but enjoyable. The graphics have a wonderful cartoony style and the backgrounds have a number of layers, giving it a nice feeling of depth. The sound effects are pretty typical for this type of game and the music is decent enough. This game is very child friendly and the humar is kind of kids cartoony, but it's enjoyable. Adults shouldn't be turned off that this looks like a kids game though. I'm sure any adult who likes this type of game will find it thoroughly enjoyable. It kind of lost some points for me for mediocre level design in the last few levels and I wish it could have been longer, though the length was fine. I restarted the game once, after about 5 hours of play on a lower difficulty, after having a hard time with some of with some of the bosses. My play time was actually only about 14 or 15 hours on a single play though. Others may have a shorter run time than me. I did a lot of backtracking to make sure I had all the items I could possibly get. Definitely well worth the price though. Overall I would give this game a rating of 8/10.

At first your character as Fu, the panda bear, is unable to jump higher than two blocks. This is annoying because you can see many different collectables or items for you to obtain, but you're unable to. Eventually after playing the story mode, rather than attempting side quests first, you gather the ability to claw onto higher blocks, at this point you can collect everything you wasn't able to before. I hated playing this game before I could get everything I needed, but after progressing, the game is much more fun to play.Sometimes the game can be quite difficult, and you can get trapped in being hit over and over again to the point where you can't fight back, but other than this, the game is actually really good. I'm glad I purchased it. The dialogue is short and to the point, but still manages to entertain me. The graphics are quite cute, sort of like a child's colouring book. And especially, it's just a bit of fun when you can't really find anything to do! I recommend this as long as you have a voucher to bring down the price, I wouldn't pay full price for this game due to it's difficulty sometimes, but overall, it's worth the purchase."

Even with limited controls (and dimensions!) the game provides plenty of ways to incorporate your own battle style in combat. Story line is dull and can go on and on, but you just want to get to the next boss scene and power up your Panda abilities that its overlooked. Some of the conversations have some humor though. This game can also be frustrating on hard at some points. To my knowledge you cant switch difficulties in game so if you just want to mess around and not be challenged at certain points, stay on medium. 4/5 for side scrollers."

While I would say it was the best platformer out there, it was well worth what I paid for it.  Got an enormous amount of gameplay and it was mildly addicting.  Although it was engaging, there were times where I had to shut the game off due to monotony and too much backtracking.  However, I would say if you're looking for a slightly above average way to kill some time on a budget, I'd recommend picking up this game.  8/10"

Even though I was playing on hardest difficulty, I was having a nice relaxing play...awwwww... relaxing.... tranquil... at peace with ones inner being... everything is so cute and cuddly.Then you hit the boss fights and soon find yourself ENRAGED! SCREAMING MAD! AND DOWNRIGHT♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥OFF!.Why is soo much of the game so mellow then the boss fights so hard? I don't know. It took me numerous tries to beat some of the bosses and it definitely made me want to quit the game for good at times. I somehow pulled through and finished the game though.All n all, I still love the game, and am sad there isn't more of it.Very fun art, music, smooth controls, and fun gameplay. It really feels like something from the SNES era. Buy it! But play on easy if you hate dark souls level of difficulty on bosses."

Some of the bosses are tough as nails and require some actual strategizing, but otherwise the game isn't too hard. The levels are huge and have lots of upgrades and stuff hidden in them, and they aren't too hard to find. Yes, SPA doesn't look that pretty, but the music's good and the dialogue has charm. The game's certainly worth the four dollars."

,Recommended,311190,30112697,Posted: 22 February,all,ProfJimbo,"Look at the Panda, become the Panda. Swing your sword, shoot magic bullets and run errands. Super Panda is a fun game where you start platfoming game. You start out with a sword and shield (you can block by holding down).  Levels earn you points to assign to different stats and upgrade enhancements rpg style.  On normal you can plow through most enemies and stages have small hearts or coins hidden in blocks and out ine open, but you can only get them once picked up.I got lost and backtracked alot trying to find upgrades and hearts. Any heart or item you can not reach require an ability - bombs for instance , so be patient.I think Super Panda Adventures is a satisfactory game with nice ideas the shield takes some adjustment to work into combat. There is a upgrade to not use any magic to block but only if you put your level up points into it. The same goes to other items and magic and stats.Some of the enemies have the same design , only with different colors and toughness or movements. Some enemies shoot straight at you, others can shoot diagonally, while still others (a cowboy robot) shoot both directions.  Near last level robot enemies get tougher.In conclusion, this game is recommended for platform lovers. A controller will help alot. Buy on sale or find out more about it online."

Part Metroidvania, part Zelda 2, with a solid nod toward vintage PC games like Commander Keen.For the price of a can of soda you're getting a solid 12-15 hour retro adventure with modern elements like a skill tree (the self-healing skill is amazing).Can't recommend enough.

My biggest concern is that some of the intermediate bosses can be unbeatable if you are on the wrong branch of the skill tree or picked up the arena items earlier."

The soundtrack and the humor are pretty good as well.My only small gripe with this game is that when using a controller, you must use the analog stick for moving(for me, and probably many others, the d-pad feels much better for 2D platformers).EDIT: I recently learned that I could have changed the controls with Steam's controller configuration feature, making my small gripe irrelevant.Overall, for this price, it's a must-have for any fan of platformers."
