,Not Recommended,311210,22591585,"Posted: 23 April, 2016",all,Tom,"Call of Duty: Black Ops III is a game which I was actually thoroughly enjoying. The gun play and new mechanics added an interesting twist on the Call of Duty series.I am however not going to write this as a positive review, simply because the game has marked me as cheating. Firstly I haven't even touched the multiplayer mode of Black Ops III - anyone who reads my reviews or checks my profile will see I have absolutely no interest in the multiplayer side of this type of game.  I was playing the single player campaign, in offline mode.Secondly, I wouldn't even know HOW to cheat, even if I wanted to. But one matter which really irks me is, even if I was cheating in single-player mode, why would anyone get a ban for that in the first place? Surely bans from playing multiplayer games should come when you play multiplayer? People who know me will know I am not that sort of person, where as people who read this will probably think I am just throwing my toys out of the pram. Believe who you wish at the end of the day. Heed my warning though.Due to the lack of any support from Steam or Treyarch themselves, this will be the absolutely last Call of Duty game I ever buy, review, or even lay my eyes on.  After doing some research into the matter, many people have been experiencing this issue, even people who play online, who just happen to be on a server with a cheater have received a ban as well.I'm sorry Treyarch - take your game back to the consoles.Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

,Not Recommended,311210,19354100,"Posted: 28 November, 2015",all,Chimes,"Context: I've been playing Call of Duty since World at War, though I skipped Advanced Warfare for lack of a platform to play it on, I considered myself done with the franchise anyway after the games began to lost their spark. So, when I built my own PC I couldn't really resist the chance to play another Treyarch Zombies experience. So, here's a little on the game modes. My lack of experience with Advanced Warfare means this is my first installment with the new mobility options, bear that in mind.Campaign: Maybe it's because I'm getting older, but by god this was the worst story I've played so far. Black Ops 1 and 2 had a story that tied together classical war gameplay with sci fi elements in a subtle way that always made the big campaigns plot twist a surprise. This time, the ending is almost blatantly laid out in front of you from the moment you beat the third mission, assuming you're paying attention. I'm not sure what the message they're trying to get across in this game is, but it's a wholy unsatisfying experience, and by the 6th mission I was turning the difficulty down to recruit just so I could slog through the boring levels and make it to the end.You're not fighting a war, because it's never really explained who you're fighting for, the game is one big game of ""Chase Paul Taylor around the world"" and by World I mean Singapore and Egypt. Level diversity isn't present here, and level design, while obviously catered to the ""new"" movement mechanics, isn't fleshed out further than the occasional few balconies in a room to add faux verticality. The campaign crutches on the movement mechanics as its interesting gimmick to keep it fresh, but it doesn't really work as well as things such as vehicular combat in the previous games, no matter how linear. The weird robot superpowers you get are all somewhat useless too, as they're just ""Point at person, make them stop shooting you for a bit of time"" Which seems a bit useless when you can just shoot them instead, or use the only decent ability to release killer flaming bees to clear a room. The Campaign is needlessly padded with customisation to add this illusion of content, when it's easier to just use the preset loadouts for each level.A boring experience with no payoff, bland characters and far too linear shooting. Playing this made me want to play Black Ops 1. The main problem I find with these overly futuristic installments is that they're not believable enough to immerse yourself in, and atmosphere is completely non existant. I hope they finally ditch this future♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's been 4 years. Take me back to World War 2 already.Zombies: I played about 4 games of the new map before putting it down for good. The whole easter egg thing was nice at first, giving you an extra objective and a way to get a few extras, like maybe all the perks on the map, but this is ♥♥♥♥ing absurd. You have to jump through far too many hoops just to get basic features, and it's just a huge chore, honestly. You pretty much have to do it as well, unless you want all your guns to be worthless by round 15. Once again, they compromised level design in favour of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly complicated story♥♥♥♥♥♥ Not to mention the bland cast of literal whos voiced by expensive actors, throwing back to Call and Mob of the Dead, but I never liked those ones anyway. Kind of annoys me that this garbage is the only map available unless you own The Giant, which is still the best map, or unless you bought the season pass.It's pulled an Assassins Creed whereby they started tuning an overarching story into it but let it get too complicated and just ditched it, I've lost track of everything at this point.  The worst part, as mentioned, is that they ruin the actual gameplay to make way for boring scavenger hunts. Shadows of Evil is boring to play, tedious and poorly designed. I haven't played a map as bad as this since Shangri-La.The Giant, a reskin of Der Reise, still stands the test of time, however. The new visuals make this look absolutely gorgeous, and stands to remind me just how old this franchise is at this point. The map has not changed whatsoever, besides randomisation of perk locations and a few small easter eggs (That don't take forever to do!) The mechanic of Pack-A-Punching your weapon twice was introduced in the first Black Ops and added generic attatchments to your weapon, but now they add interesting mechanics to your guns, allowing zombies to explode into fireworks that damage other zombies in an AOE, for example. Finally, the Gobblegum machine is easily the best addition to the game mode since the introduction of the Pack a Punch in the original Der Reise. A fantastic way to add small power ups that are consumable. Extremely powerful ones, such as spawning an ammo box on command, are gated behind a drop system, which reeks of a microtransaction system that was probably removed at the last second. As usual, I'll be waiting for the rest of the maps to release before passing my final judgement, but if you're going to buy the base game and that alone for a taste of modern Zombies, then you'll be disappointed.Multiplayer: And I thought League of Legends had mobility creep, yet here we are. There are now about 1000 new ways to avoid getting shot, which is actually pretty nice, because it adds far more depth to the dueling aspect of meeting someone in the middle of an open area. Sliding, Jumping, Wall-running all add to a rather refreshing way to play the game. I'll stand by the statement that this mechanic was a fantastic addition to the game.In terms of balance, it feels like they've gone for the MW2 approach, whereby ""If everything is disgustingly OP, then nothing is!"" which isn't actually a bad thing. SMG's are still far too powerful, sniper rifles will always be the bane of my existence, and for once the shotguns aren't garbage. Melee has been replaced with weapon butting which is no longer an instant kill, which I feel makes sense with all the new ways to fly at your opponent at light speed. However, you can still equip a knife as a secondary which kills instantly, leading to a lot of knife only players. Maps are well designed around movement, but other than that they're pretty weak. None of them are fun or satisfying to play, and the classic spawn flipping is still as frustrating as ever. All the maps are medium sized, and there's no real diversity like back in MW2 where you had huge maps and tiny ones. Nothing is unique, it's all grey again and devoid of colour, which sorely disappointed me.However, as usual Multiplayer is ♥♥♥♥ing overflowing with content, and it's easy to justify the price tag on this game when you see what♥♥♥♥♥♥like Battlefront gets away with charging £40 for. There's loads to unlock, accomplish and use. Every game you get like 5 new shiny rewards to skinner box you into playing more, yet there's still no real reason to prestige. This amount of content makes the game feel ""worth it"" in the same way a £50 box of 50 sweets is worth it, but you'll get bored of the same sweet eventually.Conclusion: If you've never liked Call of Duty, this game won't do anything to change that. Couple the *complete* lack of innovation in this installment with the abysmally small PC playerbase and uninspired themes I feel like this is one of the weakest Call of Duty games ever. And I enjoyed Ghosts. In its current state, I find it hard to reccomend as what you get is a lot of content, but it's all frustrating and ultimately worthless. The running joke has always been that ""Call of Duty is always the same"" but this is no more obvious than in this installment. Feels like a mediocre side-grade of Advanced Warfare.If you're reading reviews for a COD game, you're not the primary market. Don't buy this.Also, do me a favour and don't comment below, my inbox is filling and I don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about what you have to say."

,Recommended,311210,31921154,Posted: 23 May,all,Prot3ctor |ZEC|,"Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 is the 12th CoD game to ever be released and 4th (after World at War in 2008, Black Ops 1 in 2010 & Black Ops 2 in 2012) of the 3arc cycle released in November 2015. Since it's the game developed by treyarch, Black Ops 3 is seperated into 3 different game modes - Campaign, Zombies & Multiplayer.Campaign is starting off rather cruelly - in the first mission you lose all of your limbs fighting a much stronger robots which straight into the year 2065 full of cybernetic abilities and upgrades. You and your team fight off some bad gays like always, get betrayed as always and win with some sacrifices in the end (as always).Multiplayer is as any usual multiplayer before, set all in maps in 2065, having to choose from up to 10 classes, each having different ability. These abilities are all class-specific (except for Blackjack), you level up as usual, sometimes get dropped cryptokeys, of which when you have enough, you can open supply drops in the Blackmarket which can drop you a certain camos and skins to customize your characters. It can also drop you a very rare (Legendary) weapons themselves, which are the ones you will want ;pZombies is as always mostly targeted for coop gameplay but solo is not restricted. There are 6 maps (with all DLCs so far up to 23.5.2017 on PC).- Shadows of Evil - it's set at the same time as Mob of the Dead from Black Ops 2 with futuristic weapons and first apperance of a new weapon - Apothicon Servant, a tactical - Lil' Arnies (same as monkey bombs but squid-ish) and boss called Margwa - it has three heads, only one opens at the time and you have 3-5 secs to shoot it, only after you kill its all 3 heads, the boss is going to die, there is also a secret bug with Civil protector but I won't spoil it too much.- The Giant - it's a remake of Der Riese from World at War and Black Ops 1 having futuristic weapons only with the return of Wunderwaffe DG-2 and hellhound rounds.- Der Eisendrache - it's a map situated in a castle set high in the mountains, returning hellhound rounds and Panzer Soldat - boss which first appeared in Origins in Black Ops 2. As in Origins, here you have 4 elemental weapons but this time they are Bows - Storm, Wolf, Void and Fire. They have their own strengths and weaknesses as staffs from Origins but over-all Storm and Wolf are the best. And also first appearance of a new special weapon ragnarok DG-4.- Zetsubou No Shima - it's a map situated on a stand-alone island near Japan with the first appearance of Spiders. they have their own special round as hellhounds and also like on The Giant, they spawn during the rounds 20+. here is also a first apperance of few specific guns but most importantly a weapon called KT-4 and a special weapon Skull which can make instakill zombies or temporary make zombies ignore you.- Gorod krovi - it's a map situated in destroyed Stalingrad by war & dragons (YUP, DRAGONS!) in Russia with an appearance of old-school guns like MG-42 or PPSH. And a first appearance of a weapon called Ray Gun Mark 3.- Revelations - it's map situated after a one bad guy destroy the worlds and splits the Eearth into tiny islands, most of the islands which are avaible to play on are remakes of older maps (for example: Shangri-La, Nacht Der Untoten or Verruckt) with a return of old weapon Thundergun.ALL OF THE ZOMBIE MAPS have some background to them, some easter eggs which joins them together and other maps and have a nice experience to play on.

,Recommended,311210,20076622,"Posted: 29 December, 2015",all,cat_toucher,"BO3 is a game that needs your attention. They are trying to show you how PC ports of COD aren't all bad and that they're trying to work on it. Treyarch really does try and make good ports of COD, all leading up to BO3, in my book, have been well made ports.With BO3, Treyarch is really stretching it. They're trying to make a new staple in PC CODs. With additions such as 2 player split-screen in every major gamemode and confirmation of mod tools coming out next year, this alone shows how serious they are with PC ports. Along side this we have full dedicated servers, an FOV slider that goes up to 120, a reasonable options menu, changable frame rates, and much more. They are even cracking down on hackers very well and swiftly. I haven't met a single hacker in any gamemode (as of writing this review).BO3 didn't have a perfect launch with many frame drops even on high end hardware. I didn't have any major problems during the launch but, after a decent amount of patches many players and me incuded can confirm that this game is polished up (compaired to the launch). As of writing this, I have no farther complaints to say about BO3 performance wise.Now lets stop talking about the PC port and start talking about BO3 as a whole. BO3 adds many new features to the COD formula. Such as specalists and a more fluid movement system. A specalist is someone you pick as your character for multiplayer that have abilities. These abilities must charge up in game and can only be used for a small amount of time. This changes up each match ever so slightly that it makes the game more refreshing to play. The new movement system isn't something to go to much in detail in, they mainly added wall running and sliding. This makes the game more fast paced and fun to play.TL;DRPros:- Split screen- Specalists- Alot of features for a PC port- New movement systemCons:- Some proformance problems still occur on lower end hardware (this isn't as bad as before though)Overall8.5/10REMEMBER, THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON THE ENJOYMENT I HAVE HAD WITH THE GAME. THIS IS ALL JUST MY OPINION."

I've only had a few close & enjoyable games where both teams had a chance.‣ Matchmaking is crap. Half the time you get placed in lobbies about to begin a match and the other half you're just joining a game thats about to end.‣ Weapon balance is just stupid. SMGs seemingly kill in less bullets than rifles and shotguns have the range of a rifle. A 6 burst LMG requires 2 bursts to sometimes kill your enemy. The addition of those supply drop weapons makes balancing even worse, one-shot kill pistol? Knife shooting side-arm one-shot that also can meelee one-shot?Pros:‣ Gamepad support is great, my 360 and One controllers both work fine with this game.‣ Solid FPS and graphics, this game definitely runs great in multiplayer if you have the minimum specs required.‣ Splitscreen support. Want to play with a buddy? You can surely play with keyboard & controller or 2 controllers. Seen countless lobbies with people using splitscreen.‣ Specialists abilities are fun to use. Seeing activision use Destiny's ability system is a great tool in the game, although the Purifier ability is a bit overpowered, each ability adds into the game to help each team and can give an edge in objective based gameplay.‣ Wall running is useful & exo boosting is limited.ZombiesCons:‣ Matchmaking for a multiplayer zombies lobby can take forever, and when you do get into a lobby, everyone one needs to 'ready up' which some players take forever to do.‣ Unless you have DLC you're limited to playingone map. Kind of a bummer, but if you do decide to buy the DLC for the zombies maps, it is well worth it. The DLC levels are well designed for the gameplay and puzzles that they offer.Pros:‣ Solo runs fine, I've had no issues. If you have minimum specs+ then the game looks and runs great.‣ Splitscreen support is great. Don't like playing zombies by yourself? Grab a controller and buddy, same as multiplayer, I've been in zombie lobbies with splitscreeners.Overall ReviewIf you can get over some of the cons the game has to offer then there is fun to be found in this game. I would not recommend this game to someone who has never touched a FPS PC game before and I recommend waiting until there is a sale for this game.I'm gonna give this game a solid6/10Buy it for the zombies and/or"

Upon first release, the game was poorly optimized even for people who had some very nice hardware for their gaming PC. However, developers saw this and eventually made the game nice and smooth. I originally played the Call of Duty series on a Playstation 3, but eventually moved on PC. When playing Black Ops 3 on here, the nostalgia hit me from all the fun times I've had with my friends from Black Ops 1 and Black Ops 2. The majority of my playtime from all of the Black Ops series (including this one) is playing Zombies mode. But I also really enjoyed the last two game's Campain and Multiplayer mode. I was highly disappointed with the Campain, seeing how it had NOTHING to do with the previous two games, but at the same time there wasn't really a way to continue the story and I'm actually a bit glad of that. The Multiplayer was a blast, it felt just like the other games. As for Zombies, it is one of the best experiences I've had in a video game. Especially, from the Workshop content. There are so many remakes and remasters of older maps that the Steam community has commited themselves to making and even new original creative maps. If you liked the last two games, you would probably enjoy this one as well."

If you wanna play this game, don't buy it at the moment.  It's literally un-f♠♠♠♠♠♠ playable! WHAT THE F♠♠♠ ACTIVISION!? AGAIN!? THIS WAS THE SAME F♠♠♠♠♠♠ ISSUE WITH ADVANCED WARFARE!!Edit 04/17/2016:This was definitely not a solid start for Black Ops 3 on PC. Overall bad optimization like its predecessor, Advanced Warfare. It was rather obvious that this game was rushed out a bit ahead of schedule before Treyarch could properly iron out as much of the issues as possible. Of course I blame the publisher, Activision, since they're the ones that set the deadlines for Treyarch. However though, I can say that it has improved since its release, but not as much as we would've liked as a community, so you're definitely gonna need a solid GPU to run this a a consistent 60 FPS, so a GTX 750 Ti won't cut it.This edit, however, will not focus on the optimization of the game, but more the changes that the developers have brought to the game (Spoiler Alert:This is still a negative review). I'd like to get this out of the way first; Black Ops 3 is a solid entry in the Call of Duty franchise with its staple muliplayer mode that actually managed to improve upon the boost jumping mechanics of Advanced Warfare, along with a somewhat lengthy campaign mode which reintroduced Co-Op mode (something I personally asked for myself), and its cult-status zombies mode. I could go in depth about each pillar of the game, but this review would draw on much longer than needed, so I'll simply say that there is fun to be had with each mode despite their flaws, especially when you have a few friends to join along.The s*** stain that destroyed Advanced Warfare has returned for Round 2 to destroy yet another entry in the Call of Duty franchise, and its name isSupply Drops. Once again, Activison takes advantage of its consumers and milks them dry of every penny possible. For those of you that have been living under a rock, supply drops are (as the name suggests) item drops that will give items of varying rarities ranging from common to epic, and they can be earned by either playing the game normally or actually spending your hard-earned money. The issue here is that the developers initially stated that all items earned from supply drops were purely cosmetic (camos, visual attachment variations, emblem pieces, etc.), and they could only be earned by playing the game. A few months later, COD points were introduced as an in-game currency that can bought with real money to buy supply drops, and further down the road, entirely new weapons with different stats were introduced such as the Shadowclaw (6 shot mini crossbow), so of course things got out of hand from there. Not only did the devs go back on their word (thanks to Activison), but they also introduced game breaking elements that are often only accessible through paying real money.For instance, the Shadowclaw has proven itself to be an extremely unbalanced weapon since each of its six shots instantly kills regardless of which body part is hit, and the dual wield option doubles the ammo capacity. A vast majority of the players that have taken to using this weapon have ranked in 1st place with a large sum of kills purely from the shadowclaw alone. To be fair, the other weapons aren't that great, but they still manage to be game breaking for their rarity alone. From my personal experience, many players in each match will drop whatever they were doing, and completely disregard the game objective the moment they see someone with one of these weapons. These players will often resort to waiting for someone to drop the weapons so they can pick them up and play around with them since they know they may not have another chance to play with them. I've once seen at least two of my team members completely disregard the objective the moment they picked up the fury's song sword from an enemy.To sum this up, the weapons have broken the balance of multiplayer, and the problem only worsens by the fact that these weapons only have a 0.8% chance of dropping. Thid in turn easily motivates many consumers to shamelessly drop hundreds of U.S. dollars for the potential chance of earning them, thus promoting a rigged gambling system that can easily be accessed by minors. Activision clearly saw dollar signs in the supply drop system since they managed to make millions alone from the Advanced Warfare version, which is why they forced Treyarch to implement this appalling system. It was obvious that adding game changing items was the only way to motivate the consumers to even buy these supply drops since camos and player skins are nowhere near as exciting.In short, Black Ops 3 is an absolute mess because of this appalling system, and it's only going to get worse since more weapons are planned for the future, showing how little Activision cares about the community."

However, the quality did need some modifications. For those with low specs, you might have a hard time running this game. While playing any of the Zombies Chronicles maps, the game does crash sometimes (for me) and so far I've found no solution to this. This does not happen often, but I've experienced crashes while playing Origins the most. For those with lower specs, you can avoid screen tearing (if you have this problem) by turning off ""Subsurface Scattering"" and ""Order Independent Transparency"". After changing these settings, you'll have a much better experience playing the game. You'll have a major fps boost, and the game should run smoothly without much of a quality difference.As for the actual review, BO3 is great if you only want it for ZOMBIES. Coming from someone who's grown up playing zombies, the nostalgia hit so hard after playing the new remastered maps...it's one of the best remasters I've ever seen from a game, therefore they did an excellent job bringing the experience back. The multiplayer is also meh. I do play it sometimes, but people only play TDM. The multi is mostly dead overall.7/10. For zombies, BO3 is probably the best COD atm for it. 8 remastered maps (9 if you include Der Riese) from WaW, BO1, and BO2.

Is it bad? No. Is it different? Yes, hence many people who have played previous FPSs and had become accustomed to a slower pace can't immediately adapt and thus think the mechanic itself is poor.- While some weapons overall outclass others, this is the case for almost any game where you can customize loadouts, even TF2. Some weapons are more well rounded than others, like the VMP, while some suit a niche playstyle, like the Razorback, which is useful by keeping distance outside of the effective range of the VMP. You connect the dots.- Black Market weapons are not broken. None of the weapons that come from them hold a pristine advantage over the default selection of weapons. The only gripe with a Black Market weapon I have is the Shadowclaw because of the Bayonet attachment. It has a larger lunge range than any other melee in the game and thus render melee weapons like the nunchucks obsolete. Something that needs to be fixed.- Contracts. Seriously, when these were added it gave new life to the game. There's an objective beyond reaching a max level and it rewards you pretty well. Recently they added a camo you can unlock via contract and it's dope.Campaign:- This campaign had the help of Jason Blundell, thus the story itself takes digging. Therein lies the problem; people who play CoD rarely have enough brain power or will to search for answers to comprehend a story. They prefer things presented directly to their face without any effort put in to dig deeper. So when a game like CoD does this, you can expect criticism from idiots to follow. That's pretty evident from a large majority of the negative reviews.Zombies:- Possibly the best zombies experience to date. Jason Blundell has outdone himself and while wirting this review Revelations is coming out in 3 days. Every map before it has been amazing in attention to detail and character dialogue. Any fan of the zombies canon and not strict gameplay will find this as an intriguing story while those who only play for gameplay might be confused but will have fun with the game nonetheless.The criticism I have for this game, despite all my praise, is how the game was released. Poorly optimized for PC, a plethora of bugs, etc. However, Treyarch stepped their game up and patched virtually every bug in Campaign, Multiplayer, and for the most part Zombies.If I was reviewing this game on release day after I had played through the Campaign, Multiplayer, and Shadows of Evil, I would probably have not recommended it. Now, it's one of the most polished Call of Dutys in recent years, despite how patchy it was on release.Also, official mod tools.

Nightmares is not having many issues anymore for some reason, so i played it a bit more)(UPDATE 2: I finished the Campaign last night. I updated it's review below)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So i bought this game back in December. I mainly wanted to play Zombies, and i liked it. However, let me break down the game a little. CAUTION: A real review incoming!Pros:+ Good Zombies mode. Shadows of Evil is actually a very detailed map. I like big city maps such as that. Unfortunately though, unless you have the Season Pass or whatever, that is the only map you can play on.+ Decent graphics. It's not better looking than Battlefront (EA), or Rainbow Six: Siege, but it's actually alright for a CoD game. Advanced Warfare honestly looks better than this, but then again this game uses the same engine like all the other CoD's out there besides AW.+ Multiplayer is alright as well. I haven't really had any connection issues or hit registration issues either. Everything seems quite stable for me in that regard. I also haven't met a hacker ONCE. Hell, i've been lucky not to meet any campers for once in a CoD game! Not to mention Exo abilities such as the jetpack are non-existant except for sliding and boost jumping. Wall running is also a thing!+ Nightmares. This idea, i actually like. I've been waiting for a Zombies campaign, and now we got one. Somehow this mode is working better than before for some reason, so i'll tell you what it basically is in a nutshell. Nightmares is pretty much the Campaign levels, but done with a different protagonist AND done in a slightly different order...with Zombies!+ Splitscreen! Yes, you heard me. There's splitscreen co-op campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies, and Nightmares! Not many devs nowadays actually give us local splitscreen in their games. And of all the devs out there to do so, it was a CoD dev! WUT?!+ Decent amount of Graphical options. You can change texture quality, texture filtering, mesh quality, shadow quality, dynamic shadows, subsurface scattering, volumetric lighting, ambient occlusion, anti-aliasing, and motion blur. Hell, they even gave us a Field of View slider, as well as Vsync, FPS limiter/slider, and pretty much almost every other video option that's in today's games.Cons:- My biggest gripe with this game right now, is the performance. The game doesn't perform as well as it should. I sometimes have a hard time pulling a consistent FPS at or above 60fps in Campaign and Nightmares. Even at high settings it still runs about the same. The only sure-fire way i could maintain a stable framerate sometimes at max settings in 1080p was by disabling Volumetric Lighting and Order Independant Transparency completely. However, i actually like those effects since this game manages to make some decent use of godrays and lighting in certain areas of the maps. But what can i do? Not to mention this game eats up WAY too much VRAM and RAM for what this game presents us in the graphics department. I can max out Battlefront, Rainbow Six: Siege, AND just about every other game in my library perfectly, but not this game unless i turn off said effects. I hope Treyarch optimizes this game a little more. However, here's where this game gets weird in terms of optimization. It's a hit or miss situation.Some people say that this game runs great for them, some say it doesn't. Unfortuantely, i am one of the people whom the game runs a bit poorly for me.Now, unlike most people here who will simply say this game performs like a child trying to shove a square into a round hole and never post their specs, i will. If Treyarch optimizes the game a bit more, i will change this review to a positive.Case: Cooler Master Elite 430GPU: Zotac GeForce GTX 970 4gb (No OC)CPU: AMD FX-8350 8-Core Black Edition (No OC)RAM: Corsair Vengeance 8gbDisk Drive: Samsung SH-224DB / BEBE DVD/CD WriterCooling Fan: Cooler Master JetFlo 95.0 CFM 120mm RedPSU: XFX TS 550W 80+ Bronze Certified ATX Power SupplyMotherboard: MSI 970A-G46Operating System: Windows 10 Home 64-Bit- Campaign isn't all that great. Ever since the start of the story, i have NO idea what the hell is even going on. I only made it to the Hypocenter level before i stopped. I just couldn't understand what it was going for honestly. One moment i'm fighting a bunch of baddies in a run down, terrorist controlled part of the city, and the next minute i'm suddenly in Singapore fighting more baddies along with robots and mechs. It doesn't help that the Campaign runs terribly for me either, but to add insult to injury, i don't even know how this is a continuation of Black Ops 2's story.UPDATE: Now that i finished the Campaign, i have to say it's still not that great. Some sequences were pretty neat. However, it didn't even feel like a Call of Duty game towards the end. It felt like it was trying to be something it was not at that point honestly. I just couldn't feel it to be honest. The whole DNI mind control thing was dragging on WAY too long.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SLIGHT SPOILER: The only thing ever mentioned about Black Ops 2 so far, was Raul Menendez. But that conversation was very short-lived. Also, they mentioned and showed Nova 6 from the first entry in the series during the last mission.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now granted i never finished the story yet, but i just cannot bring myself to do so. Maybe when they fix some of the game's issues and whatnot, i'll come back to it once more. For now, i'd just skip it.- Specialists. I only really like 3 of em honestly. Ruin, Spectre, and Outrider. The others, aren't really as interesting, but the whole specialist thing isn't really that great to me regardless. To me i think it'd be cooler if we could make our own MP character ya know? Or not make, but perhaps build our own.My final verdict thus far, is still a 6/10. I will change this to a positive, should Treyarch fix up the game a bit. I will still go on here from time to time to play a few matches of Multiplayer and Zombies. I will update review as necessary. I do wish there were a neutral or average option instead of a straight like or dislike.I am excited for the modding tools as well, but i hope that they deliver with that. If not, then i don't know honestly."

I like this game, but sorry, this cannot happen, unless you fix this optimization error my analysis will keep being negative.P.S: If you live in South America, with the lag, no matter how fast your connection is, you cannot be able to play multiplayer mode without some lag or even find a match. If you find a match, it will be probably lagged, and forget about the especials game mods like ""gun game"" you will probably not find a match. It's up to you guys, if you accept this terms, buy it. I did it.Update:IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL IN MY CASE. I know that. I'm not trying to make this game look bad. It's just that a lot of people are having real problems, a friend of mine bought the game, at the beta, he run it with no problem, and now, he can't even run it in ALL LOW SETTINGS.

Check geforce experience, check where ever you need to but there was a whole update to fix bo3 issues.If that doesn't work go into the nvidia control panel, manage 3D settings, click on the program settings tab, put bo3 as the program, and for the graphics processor select the one you run games with. For me it's the ""High-performance NVIDIA processor"". After that press save or whatever it is, and try bo3 again.If none of that works, it's either you have windows 10 (which is not optimized for nvidia right now) just can't run the game from your side.""-----------------------------------------------Spanish:Tengo una GTX 970 y un Intel Core i7, el juego me corre a 60FPS a la máxima calidad (con algunos bajones) pero no puedo jugarlo, ¡La RAM no lo soporta!

The workarounds are to drop your settings low enough to get a very high fps (>150 was good), which is unacceptable, use Vsync (which introduces input lag anyway, just no where near as much but enough to not play), or to lock your framerate to just below your monitors refresh rate, but that ended up introducing stuttering for some reason.For now, spend your money elsewhere.I'll update this if they fix it, but I'm guessing it's baked pretty heavily into the engine and will be no easy task to fix.Beyond that issue, there does look to be some interesting features and some nice, in depth gun customisation, but unfortunately that is all for naught until the game is in a playable state."

I've been a COD fan since the original release over 10 years ago.  However, the devs seem insanely insistent upon using the antiquated Quake engine and its inherently broken net code as the foundation for new COD releases.  Anyway, I don't need to rehash all of the well known engineering shortcomings of Treyarch et al.As far as BO3 goes, I will start with the campaign aspect.  I will sum it up in two words:  Not Good.  I don't know what they did with the mouse interface, but, its clumsy and somewhat laggy.  None of the mouse sensitivity settings, filtering or acceleration features have any impact on the problem,The graphics are ok and appear to be better optimized than AW.  However, they are still just a warmed over, repackaged offering of the previous COD releases.As far as the actual campaign play itself is concerned, its bad.  There are far too many cut scenes and despite having good actors, the acting is poor and the dialogue is worse.  It seems as thought they tried too hard to make this some sort of trippy mind sch♥♥♥♥.  Overall, the campaign lacked direction and was constantly interrupted by far too many cut scenes.The campaign story line itself is the same recycled story line that follows our fearless hero through a gauntlet of issues that have the same plot twist (the ally turned villain twist) as the last few releases.  Its tired and its time for something new.The multiplayer experience is somewhat improved with the elimination of the ridiculous exo-suit jumping.  Weapon usage is not as efficient as AW or the previous releases.  There are still OP'd weapons and the options for perks and attachments is somewhat the same.The inherent netcode latency is still ever present and a real downer.  Of course, that is to be expected since they are still using the antiquated Quake engine.  The lag compensation is horrible and once again, hobbles players with good systems and connections to the utter elimination of skill based kills.However, judging the game as a whole, its not worth the hype and is not worth the hefty $60 price tag.Call of Duty Black Ops III is just another stepping stone in the sad and tragic decline of a once great  franchise."

Bland characters and uninspired relationships between them made the story less interesting than it actually is.DISCLAIMER: Review willNOTcontain spoilers regarding the story.SingleplayerStarting off really strong, it seemed like for once, after a while, Black Ops 3 went on the right track regarding the story aspect of their games.  Unfortunately, albeit the game differs from the standard Call of Duty storytelling, lack of engaging characters and caring relationships left a sour taste in my mouth after I completed the storyline. Voice acting of the 'Player' was really subpar and felt rather tedious towards the end. Black Ops 3 goes for a Bioshock Infinite or Spec Ops - The Line storytelling with its numerous plot twists and somewhat mind-♥♥♥♥ ending.Player gets the ability to choose the gear they start with alongside the abilities they want to use during the game which, although shakes things up a bit, doesn't really bring any sort of special excitement while in combat.Overall, even tho the singleplayer tries something different and unexpected for Call of Duty franchise, it lacks some of the core forms in order to prevail and be memorable.Graphics and optimisationCurrently rocking GTX 970 with i5 4690k and 16 GB, and when it comes to performance, I had no issues, except for the first few days of the launch, which shows the dedication of the developers to constantly improve on all fronts.Graphically, I felt it was beautiful, nothing really astonishing, but it definitely moves the bar a notch higher than previous chapters.Multiplayer and zombiesAs most of you know, multiplayer is the part of the game that Call of Duty excells at. Considering this is Treyarch and how active and caring they are for the community, I felt like this game can strive for a very long time. Fluid movement, solid combat system, zombies, great maps and supportive community will guarantee this game a bright future.TL;DR - Black Ops 3 improves on almost every aspect compared to it's previous version, and brings even more to the table. If you're a looking for a great fast-paced first person shooter, look no further.Rating: 8.5/10"

The aiming felt off, it was too quick in hip fire, but when aiming down sights it slowed down way too much, I would think if you're going to make a fast paced shooter like this aiming down the sights shouldn't slow you down THAT much. I understand this game has a lot of content as far as customization goes, but my main problem with it all is that none of it feels genuine it all feels slapped together and completely random, unlocking stuff was just as confusing as the menu system I barely knew what was popping up half of the time. Regardless of all that a big part of me buying this game was to play zombies with my friends.... what the hell happened to zombies in this game? Just buy sniper elite it has a far better zombie mode than call of duty, and what the hell is nightmare? theres almost little to no explanation or easy to read description of anything in this entire game.

EVEN IF THEY ACTUALLY IMPRESS ME, IT WON'T BE ENOUGH TO MAKE UP FOR ALL THE BAD THINGS.ALSO, THE PART WHERE I RANT ABOUT HOW THE GAME DOESN'T OFFER ME ANY FUN AFTER 180 HOURS WILL BE CHANGED AS MY PLAYTIME GOES UP.I HAVE ALSO TAKEN THIS OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE MINOR CHANGES WHICH MAKE THE REVIEW EASIER TO READ.NOTE: I reference other Call of Duty titles which aren’t in my Steam library. I assure you I have played them on console and I have experience with every gamemode. And even though you might consider my personal opinion on this game unfair since it’s a bad PC port, the quality of what you get for giving the companies money for this game is still worse than in older titles.I gave this game a positive review before. I don’t know why. The game didn't deserve it in the first place, and now deserves it even less.I talked about how great I found the campaign. Unlike others, you get to hear your character talk throughout the gameplay and get to customize him/her fairly. Complicated story, not connected to BO1 or BO2, but set in the same universe. I had to look up a guide explaining it and I guess it makes sense, but either way, for the gameplay it offers, I really like it. However, God forbid your internet happens to go off, no connection to Treyarch Servers means getting kicked from a solo Campaign game. I had to replay one mission from the start twice, once because of losing connection to servers and once because of a random error (the game has a lot). I also had a bug where I couldn't continue my mission from the latest checkpoint after saving and quitting, and the bug was there ever since mission 2 and is still present after completing the game. You can make Paintjobs and gun variations like in Multiplayer, and you have a 4-player survival simulator which reminds me of the Survival against humans in Modern Warfare games. The story can be played in 5 different difficulty levels.I said I liked the multiplayer. I mentioned some unbalanced weapons, but said that doesn’t affect the overall experience. THINGS HAVE CHANGED. They just keep adding bad melee weapons which are just reskins of each other, with each one looking worse and less original than the first. They now add terrible ranged weapons too. However, every now and then there is an overpowered recreation of a fan-favorite weapon from older, much better COD Multiplayers. But, good luck even getting a weapon if it isn’t guaranteed in a supply drop. The chances are too slim, and drops are filled with crappy Legendaries and Epics (I’m even just talking about weapons! There are so many UGLY Camos for your guns or Specialist Outfits that don’t even deserve such a rarity!). The contracts were introduced to keep the community running and tell people that there are more gamemodes than just Team Deathmatch. All they can do is, if there is a Daily or a Weekly Contract for getting wins on a certain gamemode, split the community so that 85% of it STILL play TDM and maybe 15% play Safeguard or whatever you need for the Contract. I say ""maybe"" because there could still be 1% of it playing Search and Destroy, but not enough people want to for matchmaking. Speaking of how bad and desperate Contracts are, most of them are just “win 10 games of *somegamemode*”. Doing good in terms of kills/deaths rarely matters for a contract which led to a lot of people, including me, to stop bothering. My K/DR is maybe barely above average after their introduction, since all that matters is going in a match and hiding in a corner while your team gets the win. The whole Black Market classifies as “Pay to Win” but in reality, it’s just pay to get a crappy Reticle for your weapon's Sight, maybe an ugly Rare Specialist helmet and the most boring static Camo there is. Activision still wants your money without giving items of good enough value in exchange, and that makes multiplayer something to stay away from.Zombies. Ah, yes, after Extinction and Exo Zombies getting♥♥♥♥♥♥on just because they aren’t Treyarch Zombies, we get the equivalent of putting various chocolate bar chunks on top of a chocolate donut which makes the original sweet taste of the donut get lost in the extra chocolate goodness. Except chocolate is good and delicious. What everyone’s favorite gamemode has become isn’t. Firstly, the only map you get in a 60$/€ game (of course, on launch day and still to this day) is terribly optimized. I don’t want to make people explode into liters of blood just to Pack-a-Punch a gun. I don’t want to become an octopus to turn on a single perk machine. I don’t want three-headed monsters and goo-spitting oversized mosquitos to interrupt my zombie train. I am only covering Shadows of Evil since that’s all you get in the base game, and every other map just keeps ruining the gamemode. Except The Giant, of course, because it is a remake. I don’t mind Zombies growing and expanding upon iconic features like Perk-a-Colas (WHICH THIS GAME HASN’T YET, THERE IS ONLY ONE NEW PERK FROM SHADOWS OF EVIL) but I sure as hell do mind developers adding unnecessary overcomplicated mechanics that lead to an unnecessarily complicated Easter Egg which I would not bother to solve (again, you need to become an octopus to turn on electricity boxes which only provide power for a few things in a small area, and to PAP you need to do sacrificial rituals – masking the chocolate donut’s flavor by adding extra sweet chocolate). Pay to Win included.What made me change my review? I think the reason is:One day I just went into the game and it wasn’t inviting at all. I didn’t feel excited to play. Nothing really new has happened which made me want to stay and play, I just waited to get downed in a game of Zombies and move to a different game…Also, even though I mentioned that I needed to change the values in the game’s Config file just to make it playable (Note that this was about 4 MONTHS after its release... and I can handle it fine on the highest graphic settings) I still gave this AAA title a positive review and have finally decided to change it. I played this game for 180 hours and I do not expect to ever exceed 200. I will keep my review on The Giant positive, since I like the original and both of the remakes. My favorite Call of Duty shall continue to be Black Ops II, and I will consider every other COD that came before Black Ops III better in terms of value. Yes, even Ghosts wasn’t Pay to Win.Conclusion: If you really want the game, get it one of the frequent 50% off Sales. You won’t play it forever and fun in every gamemode isn’t guaranteed. The DLC packs are a rip-off, the content you get keeps dropping in both quality and quantity and the prices go up every 4 new games or so. Actually, there’s no point in mentioning it since you can no longer buy just the DLC you like for PC, only the Season Pass, which I will now refer to as $ea$on Pa$$. I’d rather have hope in Infinite Warfare to give me a reasonable Campaign experience than trust Treyarch and get an unrecognizable mess of a beloved gamemode."

I used to play on 60-90fps high-extra settings on AW when it first came out, after the patches on AW I went down to medium-high settings. BO3 beta was basically the same, but BO3 in it's current state gives me 60 fps with an occasional drop on low settings. Does BO3 look any better than AW? NOPE, but it requires more resources, It wouldn't suprise me if they're just adding code filling to make the game seem next-gen/graphically intensive.. especially since pirated AW could run on far lower specs than the legal version... I regret my purchase so much, playing this game is just depressing, but I feel like I have to get my money's worth and play it. I played since MW, on console, which was fun as hell. But the CODs after MW are just losing quality with each release. Maybe the COD formula just got boring to me, but B03 has features like paintshop that don't work 50% of the time.. The game itself crashes when I close it sometimes and it always has a lingering effect on my system's resources a couple minutes after closing it. Sure, they announced modding/mapping tools that MIGHT (It'll probably get delayed) come out March 2016 in CLOSED ALPHA. The final product will probably come out when BO4 or whatever the fudge they decide to call it comes out. This is my last COD, activison sucks, I bought this and didn't return it, since Treyarch usually makes great ports (look at BO and BO2) and allowed myself to play over 2 hours. You're paying 60$, not including DLC, for a reskin with slightly different movement and headaches, every gun is identical to some gun in a previous COD, gg activision, your cash cow is gonna die soon anyways, at least on PC."

First of all, the game randomly slows down to an unbearable stutter for no apparent reason just to be working completely fine in the same scenery, same settings after restart or death or just because ""f**k you, that's why"".The game feels glitchy with bits of game-engine based scenes flashing occasionally inbetween cutscenes or sometimes for no apparent reasons. AI is probably the worst I've seen in an FPS game in a long stretch. Computer opponents just stand still most of the cases. Friendlies sometimes stop and stare at walls... Textures look incredibly pixelated (or sometimes are just missing!) on any setting below ""Extra"" and explosions are sets of flat animated sprites that sometimes look funny when occuring on small surfaces where it just looks like taken straight from Doom 1 :). Sometimes you do see flickering, stretched polygons instead of textures or sprites. Story feels incredibly fragmented with vaguely associated episodes. The worst bit so far is the voice-over tho. Sounds absolutely fake and lacklustre, and is quite obiously recorded in fragments with VO actors not seeing the actual game during a session. Many times I was under an impression that the VO doesn't really match what I'm seeing on screen. Absolutely horrid.As a big and long-time fan I have to admit that it's probably the worst Call of Duty game I've played so far. What makes things even worse is the fact that in the main menu there's a button that blatantly says ""Coming Soon"" being almost a spit in the face from the Dev saying ""Yes we didn't finish the game for which you've paid the full price. Whaddya gonna do about it?""."

From what I understand, the VAC software constantly checks for any background programs you are running that are for cheating/hacking the game.  While it is a mostly fool-proof system, the latest thing I had downloaded was rainmeter -_-.  On top of wrongfully banning me (and conveniently ignoring the hackers that were present almost every game), all steam support would do when I support ticket was send me a bot message that all vac bans were final and blah blah blah.  While doing some digging I saw there may be an appeal process if you contact the developer, (in this case it was activision/treyarch).  Even worse, you can't even try to send a support ticket or talk to a real person.  All they have are forums that they MIGHT look at.This is less of  a bad review on the game itself, and more of a bad review on Valve and Activision.After years of not playing Call of Duty, they finally release a game that I legitimately enjoy, then after only a month, immediately snatch it from me with not even a reason why I was banned (because im pretty sure it wasnt even rainmeter).But yeah, pros: good story-ish, fun to play multiplayer, fun zombies (not as good as first black ops thoCons: hackers go unpunished (except for me and my ""hacking"" self apparently), and thats basically ithackers/aimboters can really ruin the multiplayer at times."

,Recommended,311210,19109742,"Posted: 15 November, 2015",all,euphoria. S> Gen Guardian Pin.,"This game brought back many great memories I have of black ops 2, both multiplayer and zombies. Although it has its hiccups with performance and optimisation due to being neglected on PC (console being Activision's and Treyarch's main audience.)The multiplayer is fluent and very black ops 2 esque, except it has the extra 'futuristic' features such as the jump-pack and wall-running (which I think is a great feature.) The maps have gone with the '3 path' approach (left side, right side and the middle) which is good when it comes to fighting in chokepoints, granting players to flank with ease. Overall, the weapon system is quite balanced and feels like Black Ops II, with the classic CoD tropes like smg run 'n' gun, bolt action snipers = best sniper etc.The zombies gamemode is by far my favourite. I remember playing transit and all of the other blops 2 zombie maps and they were really fun. The stock map 'Shadows of Evil' follows a similar storyline to the Black Ops II map 'Mob of the Dead.' Where the four playable characters have all committed a sin which needs to be settled with by an external force. The map layout might seem quite daunting at first but after playing it multiple times you'll get the hang of it. The classic perk machines are back and the new gobblegum feature adds a little extra to the mode also, with the ability to get extra perks like keeping your guns after downing, or the more rare gobblegums like the wall buy auto pack-a-punched (which in my opinion seems really overpowered.)Overall, zombies and multiplayer are my favourite parts of the game, they are both balanced and well-made in regards to keeping it fresh and fun.Also, the campaign sucks as always <|:^)"

From classic maps i definitely recommend ""Origins"", i've done the ester egg quite a lot of times, it's so addictive.With an amazing returning ofElena Siegman.Cons:-Multiplayer-  Some people might disagree with me but i can hardly recomend BO3 multiplayer, it's like a huge clown parade with people jumping around the map , wallrunning with hillarious weapon skins and boxing gloves.-Weapons from crates-  which are not only cosmetics, you can actually get weapons that are A LOT STRONGER than the stock guns you can unlock.-Microtransactions.Updated 09/05/2017Recommended for Campaign and Zombies, i recommend playing campaign solo first time if you are into the story!"

Black Ops 3 is just... good and thats all... nothing special- A huge step back comparing to Black Ops 2 (one ending, no moral choices, no extra missions etc.)- Only 11 missions (which is about 6-7hrs of gameplay and maybe 10-11hrs on realistic mode)- None of the characters are interesting- Character customization is a joke6/10... and 8/10 if You want to play with friends--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Multiplayer:+ Almost great balance+ Well designed maps (with a little exception for Breach... wtf is this map???)+ Specialists are awesome+ Swimming, thrust jumps and wall running equals smooth and fast paced action+ Paintjobs, gunsmith, black market, character/weapon customization, tons of skins, challenges and stuff+/- Some maps are not designed for a new movement system, but its not a problem when map looks awesome- Some ""special abilities"" are not as good as the others or they are too good (I'm looking at You Reaper)- Small amount of weapons (7x AR, 6x SMG, 4x LMG/Shotguns/Sniper rifles, 3 pistols, 2 launchers and a knife)... thats 31 in total comparing to 42 in Black Ops and 49 in MW39/10--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Zombies:+ 'Shadows of evil' is climatic as hell+ Easter eggs+ Interesting characters (especially in 'SoE')+ Quotable dialogues+ Gooblegums+ Dead Ops Arcade 2 is way better than the first one+ You can unlock extra weapon camos by playing zombies (same with campaign, but campaign skins are ugly as f*ck)+ New Pack-a-Punch mechanics that gives You extra perks for Your weapon when You are upgrading it many times+ Thank God we dont have 'thrust jumps' and wall runs in Zombies (well... we can wallrun on one spot in SoE but... its only one damn spot so its acceptable I think)- Ummm... where the hell is Grief Mode?- Only one map (three if we count 'the Giant' as expansion and 'Dead Ops Arcade' as mini-game)8/10 (well I would give 9 out of 10 but... its only one map and the rest will be in dlc so... we just need to wait)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------tl;dr? :PIn overall I rate this game8+/10with its great multiplayer, awesome zombies mode and cooperative campaign. The only one true downside is the 'Single Player' mode which is not satisfying as it should be with its mediocre plot and lack of things that Black Ops 2 gave to us 3 years ago.P.S. I didn't mention 'Free run' mode which is basically a time trail on 4 special maps. Its fun to check once in a while. Nothing special but its not bad.* I'm not a fanboy of Black Ops 2 but seriously... Menendez is a well crafted character with an interesting backstory... the problem is that most of the CoD players are rushing campaign (or didnt even touch it) just to beat it as fast as they can and they are not interested in characters. Menendez was ranked #1 on GameInformer's list of top 10 villain's of 2012."
,Recommended,311210,26468529,"Posted: 6 November, 2016",all,"Hyps,♥","Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 is my favourite game in the franchise (Yes, even better than the holy grail that is Call of Duty 4). Not only is the singleplayer a pleasant, fresh experience that is actually vastly different than the 'kill terrorist' storyline the others tend to go with, but the multiplayer is a good mix of old and new. The parkour elements aren't too overwhelming, and you get the hang of things like wallrunning and boosting quite easily. The range of weapons is already quite good, not to mention the massive amount of melee weapons you can find in crates.When people mention 'crates' in games, it's quite scary - microtransactions in a full-priced game is generally a no-no. But the only things you get from these crates are entirely cosmetic - camos, animations for the end game screen and melee weapons which are all one-hit kills anyway.EDIT: I forgot, there are several weapons you can get from crates but they're not more powerful than the normal weapons - things like a two-round burst pistol, or a little compact crossbow. I wouldn't make too much of a judgement on this though. :)Things like creating your own camo for your weapons to the new Workshop support are one of many reasons why I think Black Ops 3 is a diamond in the rough. I believe people just have to give the franchise a chance now and then rather than brushing it off as another mediocre game in a mediocre franchise milking money. I think Treyarch are the best developers of CoD, and if not Black Ops 3 being my favourite it would definitely be Black Ops 1.Optimization is on point, with 80+ FPS on Ultra graphics constantly. There is some lag on the community maps on the workshop now and then, but that isn't Treyarch."

And I honestly feel that the more sci-fi and futuristic COD goes, the more they jazz up the movement mechanics, the more they ruin sniping. Sure, sniping still works, but the dash, jet pack/boost mechanics make it so easy to evade snipers. I'm praying that 'Infinite Warfare' gets this right.Don't get me wrong, the jet pack/boost mechanics are awesome, and they work for this game, just not for sniping.I want to see more COD games with a historical theme.

NO! Its a rip off to mine some money from the players and even if you get a gun or sometihing, you would must likely have used 100 dollars, for an average SMG or stupid meele knife.Then there are people out there who only play one map and spam the heck out of it, like Nuketown for example. A lot of campers too and to many NOOBgun users.I have like 100 hours on this game. and that is mainly because I did enjoy at one point and I still do, if I am lucky and get into good match, with good player I can most likely play for about 3-4 rounds and then it gets boring. Even the zombies isn't that good or fun to play, Black ops 1 for me persoanlly had the best zombies after Black Ops 2. so honestly guys if you want a good Call of Duty game, buy Black Ops 2, because this is not a game worth your time and its certainly not worth the full price either, so if you are going to buy it, do it when there are sales.Overall score:If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumb up! :)Overall score:  4/10"

,Not Recommended,311210,21450369,"Posted: 25 February, 2016",all,Kitsunuki,"Ok. Now that I have thouroughly played the game. First of all, the game rewards players with lag. They slide around the map making them impossible to hit while players with excellent PING (mine averages in the 30's) are punished. When a sliding guy keeps disappearing and re-appearing across the map and has a ping of 300 is the top player, you have a problem. Next issue, shotguns. Yes I know Shotguns in real life have a greater range than in  this game, however, this is a game. Any noob can pick up the Haymaker and become a ""great player"" or almost any shotguns for that matter and it forces other players to do the same making the game full of shotgunners and no longer fun. Just have one as a special weapon or something. Someone across the map in sniping possition, with a shotgun, shouldn't be able to out gun an AR. Thats kinda BS. Next issue, the range of the combat knife...it's like 10 in game feet. It's rediculous. Next I wish they got rid of the ""classes"" in the game they are also unbalanced. Until they work on these things, which they won't, I cannot recommend this game to anyone. I will not be buying the next iteration of this game unless they make a huge improvement to it. The only reason I am, and will continue to play it, is because I bought it and the season pass. Since I spent almost $100, I dont feel like wasting my money. Don't be like me. Wait before buying it. If I knew they were going to do a $15 Multiplayer thing, I would have just bought that. 4/10 cannot recommend."

( Wrote 30.04.2017. 05.00 AM, yes, I know I'm crazy, now continue on reading this review.)GENERAL+ Best colors I've ever seen in a game ever. (That's just my opinion, don't get salty)+ The sliding feels smoother than ever, same with the thrust jump.+ Weapons feels smooth and nice.+ Specialists. Probably the best thing they added in the game.+ Just about everything is customizable.+ You can now shoot while swimming.+ Mod tools.+ The futuristic part works.+ The game used to have monthly updates util April 2017. (Adding new weapons and hotfixes)+ A lot of different modes, (Normal Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies, Dead Ops Arcade 2, ((Which is a spin - off third person zombies mode, first seen in Black ops 1)) Freerun ((Which is a parkour mode with leaderboards (take notes Infinity ward) and a campaign with zombies.)+ FOV scale actually works!The futuristic part can really put some people off.- The game is in fact published by Activision, which means microtransactions, A LOT OF MICROTRANSACTIONS.CAMPAIGNTL;DR: I really don't know, watch some gameplay videos off the campaign if you're interested. If you want something similar, buy Advanced warfare, that campaign is fantastic.+ Added a new difficulty mode, realistic, which is impossible.+ Co - op.- The campaign have no connection to its predecessors.- Enemy varierity. This is a problem in every call of duty game ever.- You have to do a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of research, get ready for metal gear 2.0.MULTIPLAYERTL;DR: Do not buy Call Of Duty: Black ops 3 for the multiplayer.+ Challenges are challenging, but rewarding.+ This game added a new camo. If you get gold on every non - dlc weapon you will get dark (dank) matter.+ Double XP on underplayed gamemodes, like capture the flag- Playing multiplayer is suicide. The game STILL have a lot off people in lv 1000, running around with broken weapons.- Community- Only gamemodes available are Team Deathmatch (TDM), Domination, FFA (Free for all) S&D ( Search and Destroy)- Weird exploit which ♥♥♥♥s up the whole multiplayer.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMTCa5-75k8ZOMBIESTL;DR: A must buy if you're a zombies fan.+ Zombies had some great maps like ""The Giant and Der EisenDrache"" and some more mediocre maps like Zetsubou no shima.+ Added a good level system, compared to black ops 2's level system which was horrible.CONCLUSION: This is by far one off my favorite Call Of Duty games, but I think you're too late to the party when it comes to the multiplayer. Wait for Call of duty WW2, or buy Black ops 2, if you want some COD games with active multiplayers. But when it comes to zombies and the game in general, it's never too late."
,Not Recommended,311210,19000016,"Posted: 10 November, 2015",all,Xpliciit,"W.I.P Review - (Work In Progress)EDIT: Treyarch implemented Micro-Transactions and therefore I no longer recommend this game unless they remove them, it is just pure greed from developers that is destroying their game, also they have capped graphics settings so you are now forced to play at low - mid range graphics settings unless you have a pro beastmode super mlg computer. There are literally no games in the world that im aware of where the developer has capped graphics purposefully seemingly to just♥♥♥♥♥♥off its playersFirstly since Black Ops 3 comes as 1 single game on your Steam Games List when you buy it but has 3 modes (Black Ops 3 Campaign, Black Ops 3 Multiplayer & Black Ops 3 Zombies) i will be reviewing them all here split into thier own sections to make it easier to see which part of the game i will be reviewing.Black Ops 3 - CampaignOver the past few CoD titles there have been all kinds of Campaign missions from blowing things up, stealthing your way through patrolling enemies, flying or controlling various vehicles of mass destruction and even venturing into space! So it should be expected of Treyarch to have a very similar style of missions.However, Treyarch are the big daddies when it comes to all things Call of Duty and generally have always had better content than Infinity Ward or the more recent Sledgehammer titles. Here in the Black Ops 3 Campaign they do not disappoint. Straight away you are dropped into a familiar CoD mission, which seems no different from any other previous CoD campaign mission but right after finishing the first mission you are thrown into the second mission where things start to get a little more interesting.Treyarch have done a fantastic job here, creating great tension and suspense moments throughout the campaign and it really shows that they have put a great deal of effort into creating something new and exciting that hasnt been done before in previous CoD campaigns. Campaign is also once again 4 player Co-Op if you play online which is the first time since World at War which brings the usual Singleplayer Campaigns into more of a multiplayer enviroment.Black Ops 3 now introduces Biometric and Cybernetic enhancements to your character. These enhancements are a completely new feature to the CoD franchise and allow your character to do so much more to the enemies such as releasing waves of 'fireflies' at them to eat away at their health and set them on fire, or taking control of enemy robotics or turrets to use against them. This does change how you can approach each mission and is a very welcome new feature to a dwindling CoD Campaigns that were starting to become a little stale and repetitive.Something else that is new to Black Ops 3 Campaign is a safehouse! This is somewhere you can relax a little inbetween missions. You are able to edit your loadout here and also use 'fabrication kits' that are aquired for completing missions or challenges in the campaign to unlock new weapons or Biometric/Cybernetic enhancements. You are also able to change your characters clothing and gender/appearance here too! Collectibles within Black Ops 3 has also had a complete overhaul from previous CoD titles. Now instead of collecting 50 or so computer intel or tablet intel, Treyarch have placed much more varied items into missions that can be collected then put onto display next to your bunk bed in the safehouse. These can be anything from minature models to various robot components or helmets/hats and some of them have glass display cases too!!Not only are there Biometric/Cybernetic enhancements and new collectibles but also there are now Medals that you can earn and display in your safehouse too. These are reletively difficult to get and will definitly require you to play through most if not all of the campaign multiple times.Lastly Treyarch have included with the Biometric/Cybernetic enhancements to your character, something called Tactical View. This shows you dangerzones in the area where you are likely to be shot or killed, it shows blast proximity of grenades or rpg's and also any enemies can be seen through walls when either you or one of your allies can see them. This Tactical View can be toned down or even turned off completely via the options menu when in the safehouse or during a mission so its not forced upon you.Also just to put the icing on the cake Treyarch show that they have gone all out this time by adding a nice surprise once you complete the campaign mode :PBlack Ops 3 - MultiplayerHaving played Multiplayer for around 5 hours, i have to say its definitely a fun experience! There are 9 Specialists that you can choose from to use and each has thier own special weapon/ability and seeing other players spraying fire and smashing to the ground with gravity spikes does give the game a more futuristic and slightly theatrical appearance as opposed to realistic, but i have thouroughly enjoyed playing this mode so far.A few things i have noticed while playing is that if you join a game while it is already in progress and your team loses or you lose, then it says at the end 'Loss stat prevented due to joining game in session' or something which means that your stats are not biased by joining a losing battle like previous CoD games.Also having read community forums for this game recently, there do appear to be alot of people struggling to join games, i have had no issues with this and joined every game and lobby so far in around 2 seconds which seems if anything faster than previous CoD titles that i have played.Black Ops 3 - ZombiesThere are two Zombies maps upon the games release (assuming you bought the Season Pass) and a new Perk-like feature called Dr Montys Factory in which you can use something called Liquid Divinium to brew up Gumballs. Liquid Divinium is aquired in either of the two zombies maps by purchasing weapons from the wall, opening doors, buying perks and using the mystery box. As for the Gumballs, they can drop power ups, give you faster aiming and running speed, allow you to teleport across the map and so on.There is also now a levelling and experience gaining feature for the zombies mode, you can prestige upto 10th zombies prestige and also level up weapons, earn camos and attachments for the weapons that you can then use in game straight off the wall or from the mystery box.The GiantThe Giant zombies map is a Der Reise remake from the World at War CoD title, playing this map after so many years just brought with it so much nostalgia! The map itself is pretty much unchanged, but there are the new Gumball machines that have been introduced to the zombies mode and new perk machines. Also the weapons are the Black Ops 3 weapons instead of the World at War weapons. Personally i feel like the weapons themselves are generally more overpowered than the World at War counterparts and getting to round 30 solo seems like no problem at all.Shadows of EvilThis zombies map is much larger than The Giant, while i have played this map, i haven't played it extensivly enough to review it just yet. Having said that, from what i have seen there are the usual several perk machines, summoning rituals, portals, new wonder weapons and so much more. The traditional Easter Egg steps for zombies mode seems far more complex and seems to take ideas from almost every previous zombies map all implemented into one. It is definitly a fun map to play and i cannot wait to play it more in depth!"

Black ops 3 is my first Call of duty in a while obviously and I will say I have mixed feelings about this game. I think this game does well at what it's trying to be and that is a Science fiction casual fast passed infantry focused arcade FPS game however it does have many drawbacks and game play flaws including a terrible single player story.[Pros]-Zombies!!-Character and weapon customization-Weapon variety-Solid and satisfying gun play-A bunch of different operators to choose from[Cons]-Single player-Graphics-Score Streaks*-Optimization**-Single zombie map without season pass***-Lousy and uncertain melee mechanics*I don't have a problem with kill/score streaks its just that some of these score streaks are insanely OP on certain modes such as domination and other objective modes.

I originally bought the game only for zombies.Overall is the game worth it? I would say so but try and snag it on sale like I did. This game can get you real mad at times but in the end if you persist you will love it. If you're just interested in zombies I would say the 60$ is worth it but that's me."

The dedis are fine, I havent experienced any lag whatsoever as far as that. It's a new release, there's gonna be bugs, there's gonna be issues, and it makes me sort of sad to see ALL these bad reviews about game performance, when the game itself is perfectly fine. No one understands developers have to be able to optimize the game for the millions of different hardware configurations out and it does take time most of the time. But I've noticed most people are complaining the game isnt optimized, and they're trying to run it on high settings with a 650 and other lower end cards, and 70% of those bad reviews are generally due to people not understand how textures work. I have a 4770k and a 980 STRIX. The game uses a little over 3gb for me with high textures, therefore anyone trying to do that on low end cards with less then 3GB of VRAM just arent going to get good performance, it simply wont work with ANY game. It's not the devs fault for that. The game is AMAZING, one of my fav cods so far. And I tend to only like treyarch games recently anyway as they're always the best optimized and fit my playstyle.

They stay true to the zombies storyline and experience, just as they have even when we were on the moon, in ww1 with robots, and in the factory that started it all.

I have not experienced any of this and my computer is not amazing. Solid 60fps on max graphics.I brought this game mainly for the zombies and the new map is really interesting. In that it feels different to every other zombies map and this makes it exiting. Can't wait for the other zombies maps to come out.Multiplayer is good as well. Prefer it to games like CSGO but I have never really liked the style of CSGO.

I was hoping it would continue from one of the endings in BO2 to clear up what looked like a cliffhanger: Raul Menendez grinning at the very end of one of the endings-> Evokes he still has something up his sleeve.Would I recommend this game?

Stale story-lines mixed with repeatable characters that we've seen again and again. Doom is the new standard on exciting single-player gameplay. Please learn from the example set by that standard.Wildly unbalanced and exploitable multiplayer. For once I'd like to play a game where teams are consistantly within 10% of each other. Don't look for that here. The first company to achieve this will likely be bathed in money.Packed full of erroneous content in the hopes that it makes up for the fundamentally flawed core of the game. Perhaps you like zombies and unlocking everything over and over but its old. Very old. The fundamental differences in skill between players juxtaposed against the boring repitition of leveling kills this game. It kills any desire to by the next Call of Duty as well.

You Eventually Get Specialists For Free In-Game (give garbage players cheap stuff, the result is aids)4.

,Recommended,311210,20110949,"Posted: 30 December, 2015",all,Aenoxys,"To start off: FrameratesFramerate issues are big in Campaign, Nightmare (Campaign mixed with zombies), and the zombies map Shadows of Evil. Campaign, during intense particle effects frames visibly dip below 60. It is the same with Nightmare mode. Shadows of Evil map freezes when moving from one section of the map to another. Shadows of Evil is virtually un-playable for most computers.Zombies:(Shadows of Evil):Zombies  has become tedious. It may take 30-80 minutes to get completely set up on this map. Shadows of Evil is very similar to Treyarch's previous map, Tranzit. Tranzit similar to Shadows of Evil is a large map comprised of zones which are all used in order to get all the items possible. The power however works by using a monster that can be used each round to turn on the power of specific areas and not covering the whole map.The map itself has frequent drops in fps when moving through zones of the map. The game tries to pull off the distinct style of the early 20th century and succeeds at it. Big Band Jazz plays before every round and sounds absolutely great! The architecture looks similar to the architecture in Bioshock Infinite. Tall skyscrapers and small shops.The enemies include: Zombies, Rolling Exploding Meatballs, The Margwa, Mosquitos, and The Gatekeepers. The enemies  are very original. The problem with the Margwa it spawns far too often. Every 3 rounds. The Margwa is hard to kill. It would be very fun to play against if only its spawn timers were longer.(The Giant):Comes with the Season Pass. An amazing map. The map is much better than Shadows of Evil. The map is simple and opening the Pack-A-Punch is far easier. There is no need to search anything up on this map to get it's full experience.The map is absolutely gorgeous. The lighting is superb and it blows away the previous renditions of the map. There are small differences in the map such as having a different timeline as all Nazi symbols have been removed and replaced with Germany's flag during World War I.Perks have been randomized and weapons from World at War are no longer in the game. The weapons have been replaced with guns with similar stats but more modern. The M1911 is no longer in the game as well. An iconic weapon marking Nazi Zombies now gone. The perks have also been changed. Their locations are now randomized making the game just a bit harder.Training on the map is also a lot harder than in previous games. Most players use the Catwalk to get to higher rounds.Multiplayer:The multiplayer has become more complicated every new installment. The movement makes the game for more complex than it's predecessors. The game allows characters to choose between certain classes. Classes change the playstyle. Some classes might be better at tanking, others might be better at sniping and so forth.The amount of guns is ridiculous. Most guns feel equally powerful which is good but makes them feel generic. What would make the guns better would be if each gun in each category made the playstyle completely different, similar to games like CS:GO where each gun has it's purpose.Perks are far less game changing than before. They give the player less power than before but with skill allow the player to make their class better than the enemy's.Killstreaks are similar to earlier Black Ops installments.NightmareNightmare mode is a very fun mode to play with friends or solo. It brings an original experience of mixing Campaign and Zombies. The Nightmare mode has frequent lag spikes due to the zombies and other enemies on screen and the complexity of the enviroments. The AI for the NPC's the player is forced to play with is absolutely horrible. One thing to be grateful for is that the AI is always in God-Mode.The difficulty of Nightmare Mode is minimal. Realistic is extremely easy and with friends is even easier. However reviving each other when one player goes down will restart the mission to the closest checkpoint which is very infuriating for players. The mode is an interesting concept but ends up feeling mediocre and forgettable.In Conclusion:The game has a lot of content. Multiplayer has a lot of content already in the game and will have you playing for hours. Zombies only has one map, which isn't very good.If you want Zombies to be fun and get the best experience possible, buy the Deluxe Edition or buy future DLC.Nightmare mode is fun but feels mediocre and forgettable. And if you're a big fan of campaign that will add even more hours to the game. So all in all I recommend this game."

There are weapons that kill enemies faster than they can possibly kill you and all you have to do is have them on your screen and hold down the fire button, provided they're close enough (Which they're nearly always going to be).

It is incredibly frustrating to look at the leaderboard and see that the people doing the best aren't people who are skilled at the game, but people who use exploits and ridiculously overpowered weapon combination.The developers should look into fixing these issues.

However Treyarch and/or Activision recently decided to introduce new weapons to Black Ops 3 through what is essentially a pay-to-win model. The only way to get these new weapons is through pure luck by unlocking ""supply drops"" (see: crates) using keys which are earned through a lengthy amount of grinding in-game OR by using real world currency.There is no other way to get these weapons legitimately. Either you play for ages and hope for the best or you spend even more money on Call of Duty. Even then the chances of getting these weapons are very slim.

,Recommended,311210,32356735,Posted: 11 June,all,나는 죽고 싶어,"With this game finally taking over as my most played game on Steam, I felt it was a good time to give it my review. Honestly, I think this is one of the best Call of Duty titles released in a long time. The developer support for Black Ops 3 is like nothing the PC CoD community has ever seen. With special 2xp MP weekends for gamemodes to help boost the pathetically low Multiplayer population (that really only play Team Deathmatch or Domination) which makes hopping into Multiplayer a real treat.Now with MP out of the way, I'll get to what 300+ of my currently 325 hours  has been spent on... Zombies. As a long time fan of the Zombies mode and story (I began playing right before Call of the Dead was released for Black Ops 1 in May 2011) this game has to be the most complete collection for your money. The soon releasing Zombies Chronicles (June 15th 2017 for PC) will add 3 classic maps from World at War (totaling to all 4 WaW Zombies maps being in BO3), 4 classic maps from Black Ops (4/6 of the maps from BO1, only leaving out the maps w/ celebrity characters), and 1 map from Black OPs II (Leaving out the maps w/out the original 4 Storyline characters). This brings this game to a total of 14/20 of the Official Zombies maps in this game.Now to discuss the original maps of this game. Without a doubt, this was the most solid season for DLC in Treyarch Zombies both gameplay and story-wise. With great maps that fleshed out the storyline and innovated the way you played zombies enough that didn't change the core mode where I can mindlessly run around and kill zombies w/out having to go out of my way if I didn't want to, but it would reward me if I chose to. On top of all of the great maps that Treyarch released offically, THERE'S MOD TOOL SUPPORT. Something CoD hasn't seen since World at War, we get the mod tools to create custom zombies maps. There are already a few good ones out (and plently mediocre ones too) and it allows you to keep coming back to the game if you ever got bored of the 14 maps provided to you by the developers.Overall, I'd say this is the most fun I've had in a Call of Duty since Black Ops 1 and can only assume when I install Zombies Chronicles on Thursday and play through all the maps I've been playing on different games for the past 6 years I'll have an even better time and probably double my playtime before the next Treyarch CoD title is released. And for that I'd say if you enjoyed any of the zombies from WaW, BO1 or BO2 it is 100% worth it to drop the $90 for BO3 + Season Pass and the extra $30 for Zombies Chronicles to get the complete collection + Custom Maps."

While the 3d movement makes this game feel refreshing compared to the old movement, the map design doesn't really take advantage of this, and are some of the worst maps in a Treyarch game despite the game's amazing gameplay.While the PC port is really good, the balance is really off since Treyarch only cares about balancing for the console versions, and as a result, there is one semi auto sniper that has no recoil, fires really fast, and kills in less than 3 shots.  While this may be balanced in the console version, on the PC version, this gun is really overpowered as you can imagine, and Treyarch refuses to create a PC specific patch to nerf it.  As a result, this leads to the balance problem every COD has, that everyone only uses like the same 3 guns, since the other guns are underpowered compared to it.  While I still love Call of Duty's multiplayer, it is starting to become really hard to recapture the second prime of Call of Duty (Modern Warfare to Modern Warfare 2)..."

,Not Recommended,311210,25646833,"Posted: 23 September, 2016",all,Golden Shart,"My first impressions on this game were initially how great it looked in comparison to the recent Call of Duty's. However, past the glamour the game is shallow and overall just another bland addition to the Call of Duty franchise. The campaign is bland. They literally copy and pasted elements from Advanced Warefare. Your celebrity friend turns out to be a bad guy. You are given compotent(s) that allow you to perform as a super soldier. There is some weapon that threatens to destroy the planet (in Advanced Warefare it's Manticore, in this game its Corvus.) The twist ending tries too hard and in the end leaves you feeling underwhelmed and like you've played this campaign before, which would be true.The multiplayer for this game is atrocious. It's your typical high latency combat in which you experience ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t deaths regularly despite how skilled and responsive you are. You have to remember that Call of Duty favors the noobs. Every element of this game is designed to allow unskilled players to have a leveled playing field with people who are better at the game. Even if you aren't getting kills you gain experience and milestones for stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥and hit markers incessantly feed your instant gratification with their ostentatiously satisfying noise, despite you doing nothing but hitting a player with a bullet. The guns in this game have absolutely no distinct characteristics that separate them from eachother. You can kill people across the map with submachine guns that have absolutely no recoil. You can play as several different heroes in multiplayer, each with their own unique ultimate ability. This isn't as cool as it sounds. Most of these classes just give you special guns and a few of them let you do AoE damage, plant mines, be invulnerable to everything except headshots for a short period of time..etc. Again, these are all things that allow you to dump on more skilled but unsuspecting players.Another thing is the maps. As per typical Call of Duty fashion, your favorite ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t maps from ten years ago are rehashed and liberally updated. Every inch of every map has two or more directions of unbroken line of sight, making it physically impossible for you have actual total situational awareness at any point. This allows people to kill you from behind at every moment, again giving unskilled players the oppurtunity to kill you if they are in the right place at the right time. But, let's get away from the typical Call of Duty franchise tropes.The skins are the most ridiculous part of this game. There are several classes of weapons. If you get a certain amount of kills or complete a certain challenge with a weapon you get a skin (a mechanic that has been apart of the Call of Duty franchise for a long time). Except the skins are the same for every gun. If you get 10 kills with one weapon, the skin you unlock for that is the same as the skin you get for getting 10 kills with another. If you get all the skins for one weapon you get a ""special"" skin thats the same for every other weapon. If you get gold skins for every weapon in a class you get a ""special"" skin that's the same for every other class. If you unlock every skin for every weapon in every class, you get the dark matter skin. The dark matter skin is considered a huge achievement, despite the fact that the least coolest skin you can buy through microtransactions is cooler than the dark matter skin. Also, there are skins purchasable through microtransactions that are almost identical, if not, virtually indistinguishable from the dark matter skin. If you were excited to showcase the astounding milestone of having unlocked every skin in multiplayer, guess what? Nobody gives a ♥♥♥♥. Or can even tell. Overall, the multiplayer experience is a facade that tricks you into believing there is actual content when in reality it is a slow, painful and unrewarding grind.The zombies are the only good thing that can be said about this game. In fact, it's the only reason that Treyarch is still involved in the franchise and the only redeeming quality of Call of Duty. That being said, it is not good enough to pay $60 for and it never will be.This game is a solid remind that this franchise is♥♥♥♥♥♥"

Of course it's very futuristic and I think that's one of the few thing that a dragging the game down.Since black ops 2 Went up to 2025 with it's story, the developers decided to continue the story but isn't that a little too far?At the end of BO2 everything was explained and pretty much the whole story was complete. This is just a little dragging, I can't argue that I liked the story in BO3 but seriously how far will Treyarch be dragging the same idea?To be fair BO2 was like the end now in BO3 the story sends us to 2065 what in my opinion is just a little too futuristic for the cod franchise. We need more COD games to become back to the World At War Standards and times and maybe the MW (1,2,3) franchises. Taking it back to the old days where the whole thing was a little more realistic.However to finish off I have to recommend the game to other COD Fans out there as it's simply another good game from Treyarch and Activision :)========================================UPDATE:Many improvements have been put in place. On PC the game is now much more Flawless and better optimised therefore, FPS drops in a gunfight or any random moments are very rare.==================================Multiplayer - What a great benefit in Black Ops 3 is that All 3: Campaign, zombies and multiplayer are in one place on the main screen and there is no need to download any extra content, like it was needed to in every single previous Call Of Duty game.

That sounds corny, I know, but itactually is.I've played every CoD game since MW3, every single one has disappointed me, until I got this. If you are looking at getting any Call of Duty game, this is the one to get.Pros-The campaign's story: It is surreal, it is visceral, it is disturbing, it is philosophical, it is easily one of the best I have ever played, and the game is worth buying for the story alone. There are scenes in this game that are going to stick with me for years to come. I have no idea how Treyarch will top this.-Campaign enemies: Lots of new enemies in this, including combat robots and walking tanks, all are actually unique in the way they act-Overall amount of content: You get a full co-op/solo campaign mode, a version of MW3's Survival mode in Campaign, a freerunning mode, classic zombie survival, a zombies campaign, something like Forza's livery editor, and, of course, multiplayer.-The weapons: A lot of the weapons feel very nice to shoot - personal favorites are the Man O' War, Gorgon and the Vesper-Freerunning: 3arc designed the freerunning mechanics around curves instead of straight lines like Advanced Warfare, and it feels great. Things just flow so nicely, and it's not blatantly unbalanced like Advanced Warfare, either. Also, you have complete control over your gun while freerunning, and it's so, so satisfying when you can rack up a killstreak going from wallrunning to powersliding to hovering to wallrunning.-The atmosphere of the campaign: It never feels as if you are fighting against some random terrorist group like it does in the other games, in fact, I forgot who the main groups in the game were becausethe hunt for Taylor and his group of 3 squadmates was all I could focus on.It feels personal, almost.-Multiplayer specialists: Each one is focused towards a specific style of play. Choose Sparrow if you like sniping, choose Spectre for CQB and stealth and Reaper for more of an assault character.-Gunsmith: This is a lot like Forza's livery creator. Take any weapon and create a paintjob for it using a large assortment of decals. You can also create variants of guns by mixing and matching attachments, these variants can be used in any mode you choose.-Mods: This is the first Call of Duty game to have mod support since World at War. Official mod tools, along with dedicated server browsers are expected sometime in mid-2016. Go figure.-It's addicting: I can't put my finger on it, but something about this game is really addicting.-Graphics: A lot of pieces of this game look incredibly good, definitely one of the better-looking games that I own. Faces were one of the things that really stood out to me.Controversial-Weapon balance: People say that this game has good weapon balance. Maybe I'm just♥♥♥♥♥♥at the game, but I feel like most of the weapons are balanced and then there's 3 that are just incredibly OP. See: Vesper, Drakon, and HVK30-Zombies: A lot of people say that Zombies was not very well done, but for what it's worth I think it's ok. They've treated it like an actual mode now, you have ranks and as I've mentioned, you can customize your weapons you get from the wall and mystery box.-Campaign ""superpowers"": This was supposed to be one of the big features of the campaign, but I never felt the need to actually use them at all. This is probably just dependent on how you play though.-Campaign characters: A few are very memorable, like Sarah Hall and John Taylor, but some of the others are just bland and forgettable-The community: I feel like the community has improved a bit, because I met a few people that were actually really nice to talk to, but then you also have a lot of trolls, wannabe dank meme quickscopers and people that are just toxic.-Only a few select modes are being played right now: As of right now, Domination, TDM and another mode are the only ones being played in multiplayer. It's not impossible to find a game that isn't on one of those modes, it'll just take longer. This might also change in the future.Cons-Nightmares: I know that this is the ""hidden"" zombies campaign, but I think it's utter♥♥♥♥♥♥and horribly done. It's just not fun, if you try to run/jump/fly away from the zombies, they just hit you once and slow you to a ♥♥♥♥ing crawl. And they tried to adapt a new story to the existing campaign levels, and it feels like you're in a ♥♥♥♥ing reeducation camp. It is miserable.-Sound: After listening to Advanced Warfare's sounds, the sound in this game is a pretty big letdown. It just has zero feel to it. The Gorgon, which is supposed to be a heavy machine gun, is actually so quiet I have to turn up my volume to hear the gunshots better.-The ""cinematic experience"" ♥♥♥♥s over the percieved power of the story a bit: The final level in this game is incredibly surreal, but I feel like to keep up with Activision's expectations, Treyarch was forced to put in an entire ♥♥♥♥ing army of people and explosions to make it ""look like a movie"". And then you have people shooting rockets at you, like, ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥ really?-Copy-pasted CSGO case system everyone is using now: Title. There was absolutely no need for this.Anyways, I do believe this sits inside my personal top 10 list at the 10th spot, behind Dying Light and Killing Floor 2. It's a great game overall and I say that you should pick it up."

You either die a tool, or you live long enough to accept the Dew and Doritos into your heart.I have experienced 0 crashes in dozens of hours. Occasional framerate drops, but nothing gamebreaking - maybe giving up a kill every now and then. Effects are great, screen clutter is great without performance hits, and Specialist and weapon balancing is on point. There is no dominant loadout or gun, as pistols can hold their own against semi-auto snipers.I absolutely recommend this game if you aren't psychotic about tick-rates, wall-banging, or serious competitive environments and just want a fast-paced arcadey FPS.Addendum: I've noticed the vast majority of the review for this game are negative because of people experiencing frame rate issues. These people then proceed to post their ""beastly"" computer builds, many of which run a GTX 970 GPU and some crazy $600 CPU. I have run this game flawlessly on both a 950 and a 970 with an i5, so I have no idea what weird♥♥♥♥♥♥those people are doing to their computers.

This game can be fun, but at the 60 dollar price point and the season pass being nearly a necessity it just isn't worth it for me.

,Not Recommended,311210,25091244,"Posted: 23 August, 2016",all,[ReAp]Veronica Vamps🦇,"Since this Game has 3 sections my review will also include 3 Sections.Let me just say the overall problem with this game many people have that it doesnt get passed the starting screen. I was troubleshooting for hours with PcDev and in the end my boyfriends files fixed it in just 5 minutes. Infact alot of NVIDIA users had by far more Problems then AMD Users.Singleplayer:The Singleplayer in Black Ops 3 has co-op up to 4 players which is a first in CoD Singleplayer History. However the Singleplayer Co-op experience used to be very bad optimised and buggy to it. Meaning that after each cutscene the FPS would drop down for both players to 15fps from 60. This got fixed later on.The Singleplayer itself is okay nothing out of the norm, if you have played the Singleplayer from Black Ops 2 you will be dissapointed with this one as this one does not give you choices. You simply watch a Story and fight with a friend or alone.For the First time in the Call of Duty Singleplayer you can choose whether you want to be male or female. But dont except the game to get it right since you might accidently turn male and your friend which picked male turns female.Another ""feature"" or singleplayer campaign that was supposed to change everything was the explanation of Zombies which we all know is a huge thing in the Black Ops Series. However it was very very lazy made and dissapointed me beyond believe.The Singleplayer you just played is now ""changed"" and muted with a completely different voice over. The Cutscenes are not actually cut out the Lipsync just doesn't sync up because it is just a last minute copy paste that they put in.The Campaign is not that great that I would like to repeat it again. I'd rather have a shorter Zombie Campaign then a lazy copy paste job.Zombies:This was probably one of the biggest Reasons why people actually purchased the game from the very beginning. But yet again this game mode was very unoptimised and buggy. This went from people getting stuck, falling through the map to 10fps for no Reason. Eventually this got fixed.The Zombie Mode itself is at first rather interesting and a bit harder then Blops2 Zombies. Most Zombie Fans enjoyed the Game alot. (can't count myself in as I suck on this mode) Eventually Treyarch decided to tune the difficulty down a bit so even more casual and newer Fans could start enjoying the mode (thanks I can play now).A new thing that got introduced to Zombies are the GobbleGums which have a pretty sweet animation once you eaten, sadly not for people that look at you, you just look a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. And with those GobbleGums came the perfect gambling system for Zombie Players. Why? Well you can get ultimate GobbleGums such as ""Wall Power"", ""On the House"" & ""Cache Back"". Infact there are 41 different gobblegums you can aqquire. You start of with 5 GobbleGums which you basically keep forever and ever disappear from your lets say inventory. However all the good and rare gobblegums are only avaible during gambling with liquid divinium. Which they made once again easier to acquire for new and old fans. Sadly some of the GobbleGums you can only get if you own the DLC.If you are to lazy or to bad to get Liquid Divinium say no more! Just buy some CoD Points and sit there all day waiting for your favourite perfect gobblegum. But be aware that next time you start up the Game, all your gobblegums might be gone because of a bug and nobody knows how to fix it. Whether PCDev nor activision will help you with this matter. Why? Because ""For Microtransaction Problems please contact Activision Support."" Good Luck with that.Also all the Gobblegums you win from the Liquid Divinium Machine you can only use once than you have to start the gambling all over again.Multiplayer:For the first time in Call of Duty Multiplayer History, you can Choose different Characters with each 1 Character Specific Weapon and 1 Character Specific Ability. You can also for the first time ever swim through water & make your own ""Camo"" which is not covering the whole gun just parts of it and mostly doesn't even load in the game.The Multiplayer used to be just as bad optimised as the Singleplayer and the Zombies Mode, with bad fps drops and mid match crashes or some PC's even were overheating.Very dissapointing was the fact that when this Game came out NOTHING had changed from the beta besides that there were more bugs then before and a few more maps.They advertised the swimming in the game alot but the maps hardly do have swimming parts or water at all. Why? Because Consoles can't handle it and have bad FPS Drops. Why do you we get the same Updates as Consoles? Because Activision.In this Multiplayer you can of course get Camos that cover the whole Gun by doing Challenges with each Gun and by opening Crates. Here we go again with the all ""new"" Gambling System that was at first for free and then got horribly changed.You could get at first only camos out of the crates and they come of course in different colours and raritys, orange being a legendary here. After a while you could start buying CoD Points. And this is where it started the greed. You only could acquire Legendary Skins from the Rare Crate which is 30 Cryptokeys. Cryptokeys you get after every Match for free. But it is also the only crate you can buy with CoD Points. 200 Cod Points for 1 Crate.But Camos are not good enough to buy Crates right? Right. So lets change this up and put weapons in the Crates which you can only get if you spend money on it. Perfect now set a few YouTubers on it inlucding Driftor (thanks for showing us you are a sell out) and people will spend their money.More and more Weapons got added all 1 hit kill, the more money you spend the more likely it is that you will get a weapon. Everything is just about these crates.Meanwhile the Multiplayer is overtaken by Cheaters and won't actually get banned unless the community sends in a video to PcDev and PcDevAssist but even then it takes up to 1 Week before somebody gets banned.And when you think it can't get any worse, they introduce the Multiplayer Starter Pack, you get all the stuff normal Game Owners get besides that you can't prestige.Many people buy this Game for the Multiplayer Experience including me and I feel ripped off if I could off just bought the Multiplayer Starter Pack 3 Months later for 15€. (Thanks I just spent 45€ for 2♥♥♥♥♥♥modes that are horrible made).There is a few weapons that might feel similiar to you. Why? because once again they are a copy paste job. They are copied and reskinned from Black Ops 2. Yes all of them, besides the Crates one. But lets be honest, you wont get them unless you are cheating and use an unlocker or spend more money then you did buying this Game + its season pass.As a little help they recently added Contracts. With these Contracts you are promised alot of Crypto Keys and even one crate with a guranteed weapon. Amazing isnt it? NO its isnt because you will just get a Meele Weapon, and thanks to the horrible Hitboxes online you wont hit anything, unless you download GTA V or something else that takes really long, for some reason then you can hit stuff.Another Big Annoying Point is although we got servers for this game they are only 20 Tick. This ruins the whole game because it is so laggy that you can honestly shoot the air behind somebody and get a headshot.We got promised to get an upgrade with Mod Tools and our Own Servers just like in Black Ops 1, once all the DLC's are released.DLC:This is a little extra section as it is a new Thing they added recently. You can't actually buy the DLC seperatly for 14,49€. No now you have to buy the Season Pass for 50€ (Originally 60€) to get all the DLC. Even though you might not want to buy them all or like them.All in all this Game is a big dissapointment.Its 2016 we still have no 60 tick Servers whilst Overwatch gets them after 3 Months.AVOID."

The previous 2 Black Ops were actually fairly decent gameplay and story wise, but I regard this third one as extremely weak in both those regards.From booting up the game for the very first time, I knew I probably wasn’t going to enjoy Black Ops 3. The menus are highly convoluted, and there are far too many things to click on, and customize, and points to spend, and news to read, and……………… Jesus Christ I just want to play the game. I remember the days when the Call of Duty games were more user friendly, with basic options to get you into the game fast and simple. Now you have to actually work just to navigate the menus.The best part is there are numerous stability issues with this PC version. Some of which have prevented me from even finishing the main campaign (not that I have much interest in doing so anyways). Frequent crashing, and infrequent graphical glitches just put me off trying to continue with the single player. The story also very little connection to the previous games, so I can’t really get into it because it feels like it’s missing a beginning.But the most disappointing aspect of Black Ops 3 (for me), was the multiplayer. The customization is too extreme, too complex, and just completely over the top. Gone are the days when you simply chose some attachments/perks and got into the gameplay. I really don’t want to choose a “character” with a “special ability” and somehow factor that into my gameplay. I don’t want cards or boosters, or any of that nonsense that ultimately just dilutes the core gameplay rather than enhance it.It feels as though Call of Duty has become more of a joke, and less of a gritty boots on the ground shooter that it’s done so well in the past. I feel Treyarch were overly ambitious with this game, and perhaps tried to change more than they should have changed. And added more than they should have added."

Every person I have talked to who plays this game hasn't even beaten the campaign, and it's not even that long, it's 6 hours at best. The actual concept is like Deus Ex Human Revolution, with the whole story of people protesting against human modifications and such, which is pretty good in the end. The soundtrack is also pretty nice but nothing to remember. I haven't play Black Ops 2 but compared to Black Ops 1 this story is like entirely different and just has the ""Black Ops"" title slapped on, this is basically its own thing.The Multiplayer is REALLY unbalanced. Seriously, how is this game an E-Sport when it's this heavily unbalanced? I'm not saying this because I'm bad at it or anything, I'm never really the one who's that bad at it, but I can't deny that this basically tests who has the most powerful gun and best internet connection.The Zombies is actually the reason I baught this game, and honestly the map you get is just stressful and overly complex. I have the season pass so I'm able to play The Giant which is really simple and fun, but I mean jesus christ, I've played this map 1,000 times back in 2009, and it's cool to see it with the amazing graphics and all but it's still the same old map with nothing different. Shadows of Evil (the map that comes with the game) requires you to do stupid, pointless, and irritating objectives just to have the abbility to upgrade your gun. Why does it have to be like this?So in conclusion, this is actually a fun game and I find enjoyment out of it, but it was not worth my money. There's things good about it, definetly, but I just wanted to focus on the negatives I felt were worth pointing out. So do I think this is terrible? No. It just didn't live up to my expectations.I WOULD recomend this game on a sale or something, at max $40 but knowing how greedy the company behind this game has been, I highly doubt you'd manage to get your hands on this any cheaper.Also this game runs fine on my computer, only times it lagged were when I was playing split screen campaign but that's understandable because it's basically rendering 2 games at once."

Fortunately when the CoD 4 remake drops the ""boots on ground"" people can go play that game and never have to worry about shifting their Y axis away from headshot height.

The co-op is a welcome addition, but with one of the series' most disappointing and uninteresting campaigns, it amounts to nothing. Most of everything that made Black Ops 2 remotely enjoyable even after the disaster that was Modern Warfare 3, and prior to the trainwreck that was Ghosts, is completely absent here.The branching and surprisingly well written story of BO2 is now a linear, half-baked, idiotic sci-fi plot with just about the dumbest endgame twist ever conceived in modern FPS. The gameplay is no better, with BioShock-esque superpowers hastily tossed in, but it amounts to nothing more than an extra grenade button with a recharge meter. There's not even a foot of depth anywhere to be found in this game.

The graphics to begin with look like absolute trash and why? To support the players who can't play on high end graphics. I find it ridiculous that Treyarch initially capped how we can play this game. After messing around with the config for around 30 minutes, I decided to play Multiplayer over the Campaign as I played BO3 quite a bit on Playstation. It's honestly the cancer of the COD community.To start with, the people in general are playing this game like absolute scumbags. Their idea of fun is pushing everything they can with a shotgun or hitting you around the head with their ""Knuckle Dusters."" Then I looked into the 'Gamepad' Settings of the menu and saw that for controllers only, there's aim assistance. How mad is that? If you use a controller to play this game you get advantages you just don't find when using Mouse and Keyboard.The one positive thing that I can bring up about BO3 is the Zombies mode (which I would've prefered to buy seperately). Shadows of Evil was a new and unique to the Zombies mode and although many serious players are very good at this concept of the game (Using the Beast etc.) many casual players suffer in this situation as there isn't a way to relax in this area of the game and do at all well. A negative within the Zombies mode is that you have to pay a considerable amount of money on the maps that may or may not be good in the future. Of course here I'm talking about the 'Season Pass.'I find that the season pass is an essential part of this game if you're buying it for the Zombies mode. If you decide not to fully invest into this game, you're stuck with the singular map that is Shadows of Evil. Now, although this map is good, it won't give you entertainment for anything over 30 hours and after that, what are you going to with the game? The maps that have been released thus far in Black Ops III have shown great promise. The Giant and Der Eisendrache are both amazing maps with extreme detail involved, but are they worth the £35 you have to pay? I guess that's up to the player.I personally believe that this game is a good buy, but I think you have to be dedicated in the game to fully enjoy it. My ratings go like this:Gameplay : 7/10Features: 8.5/10Community : 6/10Overall : 7.5/10"

,Recommended,311210,27057269,"Posted: 23 November, 2016",all,SFB,"Let me be clear, this game does have its issues, but if you are looking for a Call of Duty that will hold you over for a very long time, this is it. Treyarch have been known supporters to the PC community for years now and Black Ops 3 really did prove that. Behind Activision's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ practices, Treyarch truly did care for the PC community compared to the trainwreck that they now call Infinity Ward.Black Ops 3 isn't perfect by any means, but look past the flaws it has great things going for it.A good campaign, not as good as Black Ops 1 or 2, but carries the story on as more of a sub-plot in how the Black Ops series was turning toA zombies Campaign too! Who would had thought that would happen. It is nothing amazing, but it is a nice fun thing Treyarch added inExcellent customization for PC players. Multiple screen support, FOV slider up to 120, LAN support and splitscreen amazing support. Small features many may not use, but is power to the consumer and I think a huge win for trying to bring the PC to the living room arguement.Multiplayer can get old quick and most people play just TDM sadly, but it has some fun elements to it. While there are payed skins and garbage like that, at least weapons are unlockable through the game and not have microtransactions *looks at Infinite Warfare*Zombie maps get even crazier. You thought the last zombie maps were nuts in Black Ops 2? Well Black Ops 3 takes that to a new level.MODS! Seriously, when was the last time you saw COD get mod support that wasn't 3rd party? Treyarch did a great service to the fans and instead of letting the game die out, went with the sincere route of letting the community expand the longevity of the game.Does Black Ops 3 have flaws? Of course, but look past it and you have an excellent package. Just avoid the season pass for the multiplayer maps and just buy the pass if you want zombies, but why buy them if you got almost over 100+ high quality zombie maps too.Thumbs up from me, Thanks Treyarch even if this game had not been perfect."

I'm going to give as fair of a review as possible.Let's start with the multiplayer: I personally have always been a fan of CoD Multiplayer even it's had it's ups and it's downs... however I did not enjoy this MP one bit. The MP is extemely unbalanced and in general is just horrible. Between the specialist classes and most of the guns, I found it near impossible to play unless you bought the game day one and grinded up the ranks to get the weapons you needed for your classes. Some guns are extremely OP and just overall ridiculous to try and use. Most games I got into were just filled with campers or trolls. I spent the least of my time on the multiplayer as I don't have patience for CoD MP a lot of the time now.Campaign: The story for the campaign was pretty confusing and I lost all track of what was going on less than half way through. However, there were a few things I found pretty fun about the story itself such as the ranking up and gaining camos from just playing. I found myself playing the story just for the camos and gun levels but paying no mind to the story at all. So if you don't care about story I would say that you will enjoy the mindless shooting and grinding to get the camos and gun levels in the campaign mode.Zombies: Zombies has been another favorite of mine since I first played it back in WaW. Most of my time playing this game was in Zombies (about 100 hours.) The zombies for this game is my favorite so far. At first I was iffy about it and thought it was going to be just a confusing mess in each of the maps. I quickly started to enjoy it once I started doing the easter eggs and realized that there is actually a reason to play zombies, they added a level system and the story actually flows. The level system imo brought life to the zombies gamemode along with the ability to earn camos, reticles, levels and attachments for the guns. One of my favorite things is to customize the guns and actually be able to play with those customized guns. The easter eggs can be done Solo or with other players which is great because not everyone has someone/ a group to play with and most times randoms in a lobby have no clue what to do when it comes to the story easter eggs. The zombies gamemode is definitely the highlight of this game and I really hope that they don't actually end it with Revelations.With all of that said I want to leave one last note. I personally think that if you are hardcore into zombies then this is the game for you. The only thing that really gets to me is that they want too much money for the season pass and game combined so if you can get both discounted (which happens every now and then) then go for it. If you are looking to buy the game for MP/Story reasons I wouldn't even bother buying it as you most likely will NOT enjoy it.Ratings(If you were curious)Campaign: 6/10MP: 4/10Zombies: 10/10Hope this review helped :)"

The skill ceiling is very low, it is rediculously easy to get a kill and because of it.

But the thing is, how can it be a great game if you see screen tearing every 30 seconds? It is close to unplayable. I have an i7 4770k and a GTX 980 but I still get about 20-30 fps. It is horribly optimized for PC at the moment and do not buy it right now. Additionally, you will always be matched up with players of much higher skill (Max Level, Prestiege 3, etc.) and they always play against you. No matter what, you will always somehow get outgunned for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t reason. Not only that, the community is comparable to toxcicity of CS:GO. Lastly, I wanted to put in that players that use cheap or OP weapons are bountiful. I saw someone get a nuclear with the automatic shotgun, the Haymaker-12. What do you get if you put all this together? You get a cheap scam as a PC port from consoles. A lot of these points are on console as well, so watch out for that. In conclusion, do not buy this game at the moment. Wait for Treyarch to hopefully fix these issues, nerf weapons that need nerfing, buff weapons that need buffing, improve the stability, and make this game a worthy successor to Black Ops 2.UPDATE: The game is now even more unplayable with the fact that there are even more lag spikes that came with the so called ""patch""UPDATE 2: Treyarch does not know how to nerf weapons (*cough* Haymaker*cough*)UPDATE 3: Okay uninstalling works great, but I tried to simply close the game, and not even Task Manager closed it. Worse than a virus.UPDATE 4: This game is official trash. Treyarch had pleny of time to balance this game, but they simply can't. Matchmaking is worse than the BETA. You will always be outgunned by, well, everything. There is no balance, you just get the L-CARs, a VMP, shotgun, Vesper, or P-O6. Then you win.

Thats right 14.99 for 5 hours total of gameplay.

I'm in Kiev, Ukraine with a 100 up and 100 down connection.  These are, by far, the worst ""dedicated servers"" I have ever had the misfortune of playing on.  Furthermore, I don't want anybody to think these are dedicated servers.  If you want to know what dedicated servers look like - go and play Black Ops 1.The gameplay itself is fun and multiplayer is great - IF YOU FIND A SERVER THAT ISN'T LAGGING OUT.Double XP weekends are the biggest joke of them all as everybody is online and the servers are garbage literally 24/7.

And when it did come out, people were talking about the multiple bugs (lossing connection in a solo game of zombies...) and poor optimization. I thought the pc version would be shown some love and had time taken into it. Something that I did not expect was how small the community is. Good luck getting into any other game modes besides TDM or DOM. Its a shame that this game turned out the way it did on pc, however, with Call of Duty's new standalone multiplayer starter pack I have seen many people in game using it and it just may make the community even bigger. I am praying that that is the case and we can see people playing  Black Ops 3 and enjoying the game. Personally I love this game.

So, I love BO1, one of my favorite multiplayer COD experiences, next to MW1 and MW2, and I was hoping BO3 would give me that same satisfying, competitive feeling, once again. I was really turned off by the ""mobility"" mechanic in this game (wall running, jet pack jumps,) which was my main deterent from buying it in the first place, but I bit the bullet and caved in, and, to my surprise, it was kind of fun, it felt pretty natural running on walls, go figure. But, I found myself getting bored as I played more games. Firefights felt EXTREMELY inconsistent, I'd peek a corner, get shot at, take cover and then die, constantly, Specialists can get ridiculously annoying and frustrating to deal with, or not deal with, because most of the time you can't do anything about it, there still seem to be performance bugs because I get hickups on my 3770k GTX 780 system with all settings turned to low or off, and there's just so much ""fluff"" to every aspect of the game, perks, specialists, black market, skins, Crytokeys, COD points, etc....Probably my biggest complaint is the way everything FEELS. I don't know how to describe the aiming in this game, it feels very strange compared to other COD's (PC) and most PC shooters, in general, it's as if you can't compensate for recoil, it just presents the spray pattern where your crosshair is, like the bullets aren't from your GUN, but from your crosshair, I'm still confused about it and can't describe the feeling, but, I couldn't aim well, at all, and I've had no problems learning other multiplayer shooters gun recoils, such as COD MW1, 2, BO1, CSGO, and BF4. The guns aren't enjoyable to use and feel weak.Bottom line is, BO3 multiplayer doesn't seem to prioritize gameplay over features. Everything is over complicated and doesn't translate well, IMO, to a fluid competitive experience. All that being said, I haven't played Single Player Mode, or Zombies, and I hear Zombie Mode is really good, but that's not why I play COD, personally, so, I'm reviewing this game solely from the Mulitplayer perspective."

These will kill you alot regardless of how good of a player you are.streaks are underwhelming. all of them can be shot down in seconds.spawns dont make much sense.team balance is punishing. Do well in a game, expect to get all the downers on your team next match.match making is horrendous. can take a while to find a game. its not because of a smaller player base, black ops 2 has no problem putting me in a full lobby with an even smaller player pool.server disconnects are annoyingly frequent.the black market thing is a veiled cash grab attempt disguised as a RNG reward system for various types of pants.the game is colorful and can be fun until you run into a team of controller users or get all the downers on your team. its an exercise in frustration for mouse and keyboard players."

It's a good shooter and plenty of fun, although the game clearly hasn't been catered toward gamepad users (which is obvious, I know, but in this day and age.... seriously, come on).I would have given this a better review if it wasn't for all the damned pricey DLCs. DLCs are good, don't get me wrong, but I don't want to have to pay a third of the cost of the base game, for only an eighth of the extra content.I remember when Activision used to make quality games, but of the few Activision games I currently own, at least 2 that I can think of, are poorly executed and with little to no help in terms of troubleshooting."

You still can't invite friends to join FFA games as the system indicates that the lobby is 'closed'. Guess they don't understand what makes FFA fun. If you can't invite your friends to play against you, the whole point of FFA is mute.  Players that thrive in this game play are still playing older Treyarch games as the lobby system seems to work correctly in BO2 for example.  Treyarch should try to interview some of us to find out whats happening and why player numbers are dwindling on the PC platform.  The last update released on 2/9 seems to have broken a few things for quite a few players. I would recommend the game if you like Hardcore mode instead of Core as the game seems to play solidly in this mode."

Depending how you view the story, it's either a BO1 campaign rip off or is an insightful expirience questioning ethics and morals when it comes to technology integration with human life.The multiplayer is near perfect, the exo-suit movement is very fresh and smooth, unlike its predecessor. The heroes adds a fresh touch to the game, and are fairly balanced (Depending on your playstyle).The zombies is alright, very confusing at first, but it becomes a challenge once you understand it."

Unbalanced weapons. Some examples are the Vesper SMG and the 205 Brecci shotgun. People abused these guns to an EXTREME, and these 2 guns battled for possesion of loser's dream guns with the ASM1 SMG and the Bal-27 AR from Advanced warfare. What do you guys think is worst? The Bal/ASM1 or the Vesper/Brecci? I'm curious to know. The exo jumps also ruin this game to an extent. The exo jumps are a COD fan's worst nightmare, and AW's were terrible. But BO3's aren't as bad.

Now it is quite playable on highest settings (solid 80-100 fps) without any crashes or stutterings. Now I can finally enjoy it at its full potential._______________Old review (negative):I really enjoy playing this game, but it gives me cancer every time it crashes or freezes because of the amount of RAM is consumes. Today 8 gigs of RAM are enough to play any game at highest possible settings without sweating but not for this one. Even on medium settings it devours 5 to 6 GB of RAM and if you don't have an SSD to quickly store the other processes' data into the page file then you're in a deep trouble. RAM fills up to 95% in just 30 seconds after you launch it and if you're lucky enough your HDD will handle storing background processes into page file quick enough, then you can play it for few more minutes until RAM consumption will reach the point when your screen will turn black and you'll only hear a looping fragment of the background sound from the game and you'll have to call the task manager to kill the games's process. Memory leak problem with this game exists since it was released a one and a half a year ago and it wasn't fixed since then and most probably won't. This is just frustrating. Though, there are still situations when you can play it without a crash but while playing, you will have that feeling that it can crash at any moment and if you're playing multiplayer or zombies your progress will be lost and you'll quit playing this game for a couple hours and then you will come back to give it another try and again, a big disappointment and so over and over again.Pros:* Zombies* Zooombiiieeeezzz* ZOMBIES!!!1* Quite entertaining multiplayer* Bonus modes (I really liked the Nightmares, you should definitely try it if you didn't yet)Cons:* Single player a bit sh*ttier than in other CoDs (I didn't play it much though, so it might get more interesting at some moment, I basically just play zombies or mp sometimes), actually it's just a matter of taste. I personally didn't enjoy it as much as I did while playing BO2's single player or the good old but gold original Black Ops campaign.* The f*cking memory leak that will ruin your mood for hours.* Other cons? I don't know... Didn't really pay attention at other flaws this game definitely has but they're all dimmed by the problem from the previous con.The game itself is not as bad as the reviews says.

It may be too soon to tell, but I think Black Ops 3 is on track to be my favorite in the series.  Multiplayer is just as in depth as it has ever been and, minus a couple of weapons (*cough* Drakon *cough*),  the wepon balance is really good.Unlike Black Ops 2, the zombies offering is in depth and engaging right out of the box.  The new progression system in Zombie mode adds another layer of replayability to the already addicting gameplay.However, not all is good in Black Ops land.  The campaign is, in my opinion, the weakest in the series.  The voice acting for the main character is uninspired at best and kind of ruins any scenes that are supposed to have an impact, especially near the end of the game.  The campaign also feels far less polished then past Call of Duty campaigns.As for the port, I have not noticed any performance issues on my rig, but mileage may vary."

Treyarch has been patching the game quite frequently, unlike AW, they've been nerfing and buffing weapons etc. staying on top of problems that need to be fixed, aswell as staying in touch of the community although they still might need a tad bit more optimization as i have seen many people complaining about there GTX 980's, 32 gb, water cooled machine not being able to run it.

,Recommended,311210,19170140,"Posted: 19 November, 2015",all,"""Original Jokes""","I will say before I bought this game I had really pondered on buying it. After ghosts and advanced warfare I thought the COD franchise was going to go to crap completely and become something of the past (which honestly there has been way too many cod games). I thought BO3 was going to be like AW. But it really isn't, it is way better andis an overall good COD game. It has the specialist features that allow you to use different abilities which at first didn't seem like that did a game changer but in fact is. The guns are not very well balanced in actuality, Althogh if you can use them all efficiently it doesnt matter FOR YOU specifically, So bassically what im saying is, guns need to be balanced a lot. Being able to make your own weapon skins is a nice edition so you can personalize weapons a bit more. Supply drops are back in from AW luckily without weapon buffs... although i think i'd rather have that than there being DLC weapons. ThE game is overall good but there are some bad things as with all games.Supply Drops. They just need to be cosmetic only or gotten rid of (even though thats never going to happen now)The weapon paint shop skins can glitch out and not show up on the menu or in game but can be fixed by turning off user created content restarting the game and re enabling itThe RAM usage of this thing has got to be fixed big time. I have 16gb of RAM and this game hogs almost all of it using anywhere from 10 on the menu to up to 12.6 GB in game which causes micro stuttering when a lot is going on.The last con is for content creators if you make vids, it only happens periodically but if you use shadow play sometimes the saved video will be pixelated and make the video glitch out a lot.Overall this game is very fun and gives you a lot more situations to have gunfights in but does need some tweaking and bug fixes.

All in all, I'd recommend it if you enjoyed MW2 and MW3 (the last CoD games I played) - it doesn't stray very far from that style of gameplay. One thing that's better about this iteration is that Treyarch appears to take cheating seriously, and gives players the tools to easily record suspected cheaters from the cheater's point of view (the reporting part of the equation leaves something to be desired though, but better than nothing). From what I've seen in the forums, the obvious cheaters are banned pretty quickly, within 24 hours or so.Bottom line, if you enjoyed previous COD games, you'll likely enjoy this one. If you aren't a fan of small maps and jackrabbit-on-crack players bouncing and jumping around everywhere, you probably won't ;)(To be honest, there is also an issue with only being able to play TDM and DOM due to the matchmaking system, but that seems to be all anyone wants to play in ANY FPS that isn't CS:GO these days, so it's not a problem specific to CoD)"

I'll start by listing some issues with the game.-It's poorly optimized for PC and consoles (Very apparent framedrops in the campaign drop as low as the 40s and possibly lower). I have a GTX 960 and an Intel i5 4460 and I can't run this game at max settings without getting random framedrops on zombie mode, and I still get the same drops at lower settings.Speaking of optimization, the is plagued with issues for PC, more so than console, and unless you have a PC that is a bit stronger than a PS4 you're going to get a lower quality experience than console.-For some reason while loading up The Giant zombies map, the entire loading cutscene was playing at 2x that normal speed, and when it finally loaded I got into a solo match running at 2-4fps. Nothing could fix the issue except actually alt tabbing out of the game and closing it from task manager, but it was still running, not even as slow as a crawl, more like a man who got both his knee caps shot and could only use one arm to drag himself.-This game is also over 60gb, and I found out that you can uninstall certain parts of the game you don't play to lower that large amount (Say you play only zombies or multiplayer) you can go to the DLC section before starting the game and just untick the arrow under the section of the game you don't play and even if you only play one section of this game you still have around 24gb for something that should actually be around 12-14gb if they actually compressed this game. But that being said I lowered the download from 60+ gigs down to around 24, and even then 24 gigs is huge for a game with 2 damn maps installed in the zombie mode.-My dad purchased the game on console and I tried multiplayer there and it is one of the worst multiplayer experiences I've had with a call of duty game since ghosts and is almost as bad as advanced warfare, but I did enjoy the beta of this game, and some how they managed to screw up the beta and make the final release horrible.-Haven't played campaign because it's still the same universe as WaW, BO1/2 and it feels like they're trying to milk a story that should have finished in BO2, and call it a sequel, and as my friend said, it's hardly connected, there's just some names brought up from BO2 that you remember and that's about it.-They added microtransactions. To a call of duty game. Where they already plan 4-5 DLC packs before the game comes out to take your money.Now obviously there's positives but there are so little and they're just personal opinion at this point-Zombies is much better than BO2 zombies which was a horribly direction for the franchise, and they somehow made it have a better story and map layout than the previously annoying maps (Falling in die rise, lava everywhere in tranzit and annoying fog, the avagadro, denizens, Nuketown zombies making you feel horribly claustrophobic, etc) and it feels like zombies should.That's actually all the positives I can think of, the zombie mode is fun and even then the game itself has horrible issues with optimization and you have to buy 19$ CAD map packs to get one damn map. But at least it's getting modding tools which will add essentially endless zombie maps created by the community.I give it 5/10, too many issues, too expensive, and too annoying to deal with and the only good thing coming from it in the future is some maps and modding tools. Don't buy it at full price, buy it at half off or better yet somehow get it for cheaper because the only reason I bought it was because it was half off and I wanted to get it before modding tools came out.Edit for Mod Tools: Mod tools were recently implemented, obviously not perfect and still in beta.Plagued with issues, but I'm hoping these issues will be cleared up when the full release out.1) Sometimes mods don't install at all, so you have to verify game cache, which can be a long process considering the huge file size of the game and depending if your HDD is fast or not.2) Downloaded mods don't appear in the ""Mods"" menu some reason so the only way to know which mods are installed are loading up MP or Zombies and going to map selection ot possibly if it's a weapon create a class.3) Workshop isn't accessible easily. To access workshop you have to go to community, select BO3's community, go to workshop then hover over something and select items for them to appear. It's completely broken.4) Playing zombie maps with friends seems to be broken and doesn't work most of the time, it's in beta still yes, but it should at least be functioning and clear on what the issue is, because every time some new issue comes up, the reason is so vague you can't really tell what the issue is.Now for Positives1) dedicated fanbase to modding, already got a few cool zombie maps and MP maps available of pretty decent quality as well as new comers testing out how.2) Cool ideas in mods and slowly growing and are accessible to everyoneThat's about it for now. If they optimize this game a bit more I might be happy and recommend this but if you do buy this, please make sure it's under 40$ cause they're gonna scam you out of your money for the DLC anyway."

As the 1st DLC map has come out, the Giant, I would highly recommend buying the Season Pass, hence clearly this call of duty, will be the one to bring cod back into the big scene of things.All in all, I would give a solid 7/10, but zombies on the other hand, would get 9/10."

Somehow they managed to make it stretch 2560x1440 resolutions regardless of setting 1:1 scaling in the nvidia control panel. The FOV feels very wrong regardless of resolution and aspect ratio - everything is super narrow and tall even when stretched.I was excited for Ben Browder voice acting but like all the audio it seems very phoned in. Weapons and explosions sound very poorly done and in general the audio is a mess. Weapons lack of any sort of feeling of impact or weight and shooting just isn't very satisifying. Rag dolls and physics is about the worst I've seen in a shooter yet.The game also stutters like mad despite maintaining 60fps and the mouse movement is terrible. I wouldn't call it laggy so much as slow - even cranking the sensitivity up it felt like trying to aim with a gamepad it was so damn slow.TL;DR so bad it made advanced warfare feel good in comparison.

The game should have been able to run 55 to 60 on the highest anti-aliasing setting but, I didn't really care that much.Multiplayer - Multiplayer ran fine too, except sometimes for some reason I can't find any matches on game modes that would usually populated and sometimes I can't connect to the severs and for some strange reason, my black ops 3 goes blue-screen after any match for a few seconds which isn't that big of a deal, but it annoys me time to time. Something else that annoys me is that you can get aim assist on with a gamepad which should just stay on the console versions of the game, not the PC port.An issue with aiming - When I go aiming down sights and move my crosshair at the enemy and moving my character my character, the accuracy  goes all weird and I can't hit any thing and if I where to play a game like Quake, Counter Strike, and some other titles, my mouse was just fine.Problems that should be fixed:- Fluctuating framerate.- Aiming.So far the game is pretty good and I like the movement system alot and the new redisigns of the score sctreaks."

,Recommended,311210,25453838,"Posted: 10 September, 2016",all,Übermensch,"Before you think I am biased...My first FPS was Team Fortress 2 and I currently primarily play Overwatch, so no, I'm not a COD fanboy.Anyway...,My experience with Call of Duty: BO3 was rather pleasant. I played this game over a free weekend, and I look forward to buying it next time it is half off. Now let's get into what this game has to offer.GAMEPLAYDuring my free weekend, I was only able to play the multiplayer. Now being that that's my favorite part of any FPS, I had no problem with that! Though this game takes place in the future, I'd compare it more to the original Black Ops than Advanced Warfare. The gameplay, while extremely fast, isn't very complex, and only takes about an hour or two of playing to get a good understanding of everything. Like most COD games, it is easy to pick up, and hard to master. If there is any advice I could give to someone who's new to the COD franchise, I'd pick up an SMG and one of Ruin's specialistics, Gravity Spikes, or Overdrive. Oh yeah, I almost forgot! Specialistics are new to the COD world, and fairly easy to understand. Think of it kind of like different classes to choose from, each of them with two devastating ""abilities"" to choose from. In Ruin's Overdrive's case, you essentially wait until your meter fills up, click the magic button, and BAM! You're running sonic speed! It's a very unique and interesting addition to BO3, and as annoying it can be, I think it deserves a place in the COD universe. It's simple, efficient, and doesn't completely take away from the gameplay. In short, the gameplay is very fun, and my only complaint is how fast people die, but hey, that's a COD thing.GRAPHICSSo I run on a craptop at like 50% render scale so it's best I don't give my two cents on this one...COMMUNITYWell, it's a COD game. However, people were generally less rude than I've seen them be on console, but this could also just be me. Who knows? All I'm saying is, the community shouldn't be the deciding factor when you're buying a game, as muting is always an option.CONCLUSIONPlaying COD BO3 is a lot like masturbating. It's not too fun, and even sometimes uncomfortable when you first start, but if you keep going, it'll get better, and better, and better! Until it gets so much better and feels so great, and then you finish and feel guilty afterwards. Okay I apologize for that.RATING7/10; people die too fast."

But if you hope to be able to play against other people online in multiplayer or in zombies, I would advise you would buy the game on a console. This is not because the game looks better on console. The servers are so badly maintained that almost every week the servers will crash during a game and will not be back up for at least 30 minutes before it crashes again.There are many more people who play the game on consoles and the servers are usually full of whining players who like to scream hackusations whenever they get killed. There is usually only a few active games available in any playlist, so if you rage quit and expect to be put into a different match you will be getting really annoyed really quickly. Overall this plays like it would on the consoles except the servers are much less reliable and the community is small.P.S. don't buy the season pack as there are not enough people who have it to be able to even vote for a new map. I bought it when I bought the game and have not been in one game on a new map.Update:There is pretty much no one online in this game anymore.

I've been a fan since Call of Duty 2, and though I didn't play Ghosts or Advanced Warfare (lucky me?) there is almost no redeeming qualities for Black Ops 3 right now. Gun balance is nonexistent with rampant automatic/semi-auto shotguns--to which Treyarch buffed their range while leaving the other, balanced shotguns alone--owning every match that they're in. Player HP is so low that anyone NOT using one is probably killing you in 2 bullets with any SMG, AR, or one shotting you with burst fire anyway.Players move like everyone is on copious amounts of Olympic steroids and the game tries to make itself faster paced than any of its predecessors. This quickly becomes annoying when people zip right by you because Stalker was made into a gun attachment and not left as a perk with other great choices to compete. (Or better yet, scrapped because this game was not designed with it in mind.)The PC version of this game is almost entirely limited to Team Deathmatch and Domination. The other game modes have little to no people in them at all. Not even Gun Game, Search and Destroy, or Free For All can get enough people to ever get started most of the time. If there's other game modes you liked, then you might as well skip this title because you're not going to be playing them on PC.Maps are pretty looking, but you'll quickly realize that some of them lack good cover and sport poor layouts. There aren't very many maps to begin with and they're all homogenized to a ""3 corridor"" layout, rapidly making them even more boring. There's some side corridors that stretch along the most of the map for no reason at all and have no cover in themselves.If you like variety in your customization of loadout perks and weaponry, then also look elsewhere. There are so few guns in this game that you would think you would be forced to purchase additional ones through DLC, but there isn't even that... You have 4-7~ guns in each category, with some variations of attachments between each. That's it. With gun balance being so terrible most people just huddle around the ""good"" ones.I can't speak for performance issues as the game fired up and defaulted to Very High settings and runs at 60 FPS all of the time. I'm running on a MSI Z97 Gaming 5 MOBO, 8 gigs Corsair 1333 mhz RAM, i5-4690k (stock), and GTX 970 (stock) with no performance issues at all. There was some texture issue with the default high res rendering, but I lowered it down to my resolution to fix that. However, players look like polished tin soldiers at times, rather than grizzled warriors that have been fighting in grimy conditions all day long. It's quite jarring in the victory screens.Another mind blowing thing is the unbelievable porting of the absolutely RIDICULOUS controller aim assist. Do you like aimbotting? Well plug in your trusty Xbox/PS3 controller because the game's aim assist is roughly one quarter of your screen. I'm not joking. You can look this up. It's very often confused with aim bots (which I've encountered) and there is absolutely no embellishing how broken this is. There is nothing more unfair than facing a Brecci/Haymaker (semi-auto and auto shotguns, respectively) using a controller and running around at lightspeed just spraying rooms. Why even try when you're going to be killed before you have a chance to ADS?This game is an absolute trainwreck in gameplay forethought and I'm baffled at how far this series continues to fall from the Modern Warfare peak. They tried to copy Titanfall, but with substantially less finesse, and they made very limited efforts to balance the game in any way shape or form. This game does not ""feel"" like Call of Duty at all, much less any other FPS you might have enjoyed playing previously. This game is for the very few on PC, but some of these balancing issues have no doubt got to be ruining the console experience as well.Do NOT purchase this game for PC. It's a waste of $45-60 that could be better spent on one of its prime competitors, or the console version if you prefer. I have tried my hardest to enjoy this game because I bought it to play with some friends. It wants to be a fun game, it really does, but it falls flat by being terribly generic and unbalanced all over the place. I'm likely to just return to playing Black Ops 1-2/Modern Warfare 3 because those were substantially more enjoyable and balanced titles. I understand some will disagree, but definitely look up some videos and read through more reviews before deciding whether or not this game is for you (on PC or otherwise).But I cannot, in good conscious, ever recommend this game to anyone in its current state. Perhaps if balance was fixed I could see enjoying this even with the horrendously dull maps. (I'm so sick of Combine being the map 70% of the time across all lobbies.)"

I will describe each mode. I will describe the campaign, zombies and multiplayer.The Campaign : Storytechnical  it´s the typical Cod campaign with many explosions and bullets. The brutality has also increased a lot which you will find out when you play it.  The new campaign system is great in my opinion. You can now play the campaign in co-op with other players or your friends from now which I find really cool in my opinion. There is also a level up system in the campaign. The higher the diffuculty level of each mission is the higher will be your XP reward. For the guns you can unlock attatchments and cammos that are for the campaign than. You need to complete certain challenges for it. I think the campaign itself didn´t changed much in an gameplay technical view but it brings new features which is worth to try out as I would say. Also the storyline is quite good and rly playable :DMultiplayer: Yeah the multiplayer. Every year the same from Activision and their partner studio. It is really the typical Cod  multiplayer but still it´s much fun. They removed the booster packs which we had in AW which I found annoying as hell. There is only small boost jump but nothing to compare with in AW. A new movement feauture is that you can now wall run . There are again 10-11 prestiges levels. You unlock items, abillitys etc over unlock tockens which you unlock after every level. You can now unlock an item or abillity that is unlocked for the your level. It always requires an certain level and an unlock tocken to unlock the thing you want. That is basicly all I can say about the multiplayer. There are no reall new gameplay modes and yeah... same as every year with a few small changes :D .Zombie mode: The zombie mode is awesome, fun and totally woth to play with your friends, alone or with public players. Sadly there is only one map if you haven´t pre-orderd the game. I bought the season pass as well just because of the zombie maps. The map that everyone has playes in chicago in the early 1930s ( Al Capone time) which I really love the atmosphere of it. The zombie mode is again a endless zombie wave mode. You fight as long as you can and try to make as many points as possible to buy your weapons, perks, upgrades and so on .  On the chicago map you need to turn into "" The beast "" first to turn on the electricity. Also you level up here as well by killing zombies and your zombie rank increases with it. Dont ask me what advantage you have of it... I didn´t found it so far.Overall I really love the zombie mode and I can really recommend this even when there is only one map for normal players so far. I can recommend to get the season pass tbh.Overall I would say that Black Ops 3 isn´t a bad game and it offers a few changes in the Call of Duty franchise but on the other side it has the classic features like in every other one. I would say you guys should grab this game on sale for like 50% off and might get the season pass as well.Rating: 7.5/10 ( including all game modes )"

Its still a great game, but for a long time cod and shooter fan like myself, I did not like the direction they went. If I want to play Halo, I'll play HALO!!  AW had a great balance, with the boost being a minor convenience. In BO3 people zoom all over the place. Fun if YOU like it, I don't. Thats just my own personal taste. BO zombies is always a little secret heavy, so I was not a fan. Played most games on Giant, which seems like a waste. Its just the other maps ALL suck in public games with other people who don't know what to do. I don't even want to talk about the SP, got too bored and never finished it. COD IW seems more like bo3, so I am in no way sure about getting it. The crafting system looks cool, and the MW remaster might clinch it. Might. I just don't ave the time anymore to waste on games that I am not 100% sure of. Might be the first cod that I don't playold reviewWell, some old cod. fun while it lasted. cheaters, solo asshats in zombies, etc. No recourse for legit players, besides ♥♥♥♥♥ing about it the forums. the response from people, besides stfu? its somehow the fault of the programmers that make their cheating and exploiting possible. yeah.Do your part and call out those that ruin it for all. don't blame cod, but blame the cheaters. Quit every game with a cheater, report them and post about them. maybe it'll help. if cod fans don't stand for our community, who will?Update: possible MP cheaters. they be startin early!Played for a few days now. Some early thoughts:MP seems ok so far. No cheaters, little or no lag, and plenty of matches.  The weapons and general gravity of the game feels a little floaty, like things have less weight than they should. Similar to Ghosts.Zombies is good, but has very poor match making. its routine to have people with 300+ ping paired with less than 20 ping! The main zombies map is very complex, with tons of hidden features. Would take hours to solve all. Giant is pretty good too, just has very few people playing.Campaign is ok so far, Fun and fast paced. Audio seems a little thin."

I have played nearly all call of duties(WaW being my favorite) so I was excited to try this one out (I have always been a huge fan of zombies) but I think this will be my last COD game. The maps seem to be getting smaller and smaller. There used to be somewhat of a variety of maps some were massive then others that you could barely spawn in now they all just feel the same wich really makes this game hard to play for more than an hour at a time without getting bored. Maybe its just me but all the maps just start to feel the same.There really isnt the player base for me either. I really only enjoy hardcore mode, and unless you are going to play DOM or TDM you will be hard pressed to find a lobby. When I try and give regular mode a try its just a barrage of one hit kill snipers that fire too quickly and remove the need of having some skill to use them.The zombie mode isnt nearly as fun as the older games but it is somewhat enjoyable to break up the repition of multiplayer. I did not get the expansion for the zombies so I cant really comment on it.If you have never played a COD game I would recommend it because they truely are fun fps with some uniqe gameplay. They are all just to similar for me to continue with this franchise."

Everything about this game from the character movements to the unlocking system has been cut to a fine diamond, taking the right notes from previous installements. There will always be haters for blockbuster game titles, especially for games that revolve around precise mechanics of gameplay. If you can clear your head of the Call Of Duty rage community, it becomes apparent that they did almost everything right in this game. All of the maps are well made and easy to figure out once you get into the multiplayer gameplay. None really stand out like nuketown did but each map has there own charm and personality. They are not large maps, however this does not take away from the long range weapon experience. The gun leveling system may be a bit too fast but honestly, who wants to spend hours upon hours on one weapon when there are so many alternative weapons to prestige. The cryptokey system is slow but opening the drops are addicting and exciting. They took out the boost funciton in advanced  warfare except for the jump which I hoped satisfied some ragers. Overall, a game will never live up to everyone's expectations and this is important to keep in mind. However, regardless of what the critics will say in forums or how much someone may claim to hate this game, it doesnt stop them from continuing to play it. That in itself is proof enough that the good ouotwieghs the bad. The only bad thing I can say about this game is the price of the season pass. Ragers, continue raging.

The game modes are fun (we tried HC TDM, TDM, Capture the Flag, Domination, Kill Confirmed) and I want to keep playing it. All the modes that I want to have in a shooter are there.

76561198042714558,Recommended,311210,20232333,"Posted: 2 January, 2016",all,Shadow Feng,"Quick Multiplayer Summary:Pros:- Quick, accurate, fun and identifiable movement based abilites.- Blanced and unqiue weapons.- Freedom of playstle.- Fast, adrenaline action.- Specialist abilites are generally fun and well balanced.Cons:- One or two weapons overpowered. (Though do not dominate the usage.)- There is technically a Cash Shop. (Though CS items can still be earned just by playing.)For all the MW, MW2, MW3, BO, BO2 multiplayer junkies out there, this game is for you. I promise you will not be disappointed.After all of the negative reviews floating around, and the utter failures that were Ghosts and Advanced Warfare, I had given up any hope of playing any of the games once again. I have been wandering around the steam library, as well as the rest of the internet seeking a multiplayer shooter that's as fast pace and thrilling as some of the Call of Duty (Modern Warfare - Black Ops 2) games were. Simply to no avail. Craving that familiar rush I tried out BO3 when it was on a free weekend, and this is much better than expected.While this game brings back a lot of the tackey / gimmicky utilites of {Power Sliding}, {Wall Running}, and {Boosting / Jet Packing} about, they actually managed to capture these events perfectly this time around. While I will find myself accidently start wall running once in a blue moon, the vast majority of the time these actions are {Clean}, {Quick}, and {Percise}. While other games had us unable to fire our weapons while so much as climbing a ladder, or power slide, we can now freely gun down people while sliding, climbing, or even swimming (Silly I know, but hell it's fun.) Using any of these moves allows you to do what you want, when you want, where you want.The guns this time around feel well balanced, as well as unique. For once we do not have the simple repeats, using and AK-47 or TYPE once again, all guns are unique allowing for a more personalized custom class.Freedom of playstyle is capitalized though the variance of perks and Specialists (A unique ability earned over time and score in match, with about 20 abilites to chose from) All playstyles are more prevalent than before, you can use any class of weapon, just as well as run and knfie (Post unlock ;.;), stealth, akimbo pistol, or use perk enchanced specialist classes all with equal efficiency. As a bonus, quick scoping seems less prevelent, though still possible.One final major note on my behalf is to warn of my only real gripe with this system. That being balancing, mainly on the behalf of the Specialist: Flamethrower. While most of the other specialist weapon abilities can also be terrifying to fight, for example anyone who is accurate with the explosive bow is likely to snipe you out before you gun them down, this still requires the skill of aiming. The Flamethrower simply needs to be nerfed in it's current state, the weapons projectile travels seeminly instantly and a long distance with a wide spread. You do have a fraction of a second to shoot back at them, however you seem to always die to the fire reguardless of how few of frames you were in contact.Overall I would give the multiplayer a 8/10. No other FPS on the market currently gives me the same rush of adrenaline and challange. Hope this helps some of our compeditive playeys out there, and happy hunting!"

You guys did a wonderful job.  I would have to say BO3 tops Infinity Ward's all stars like COD4 and MW2.  For years, I stopped playing Call of Duty.  MW2 and BO2 was the last enjoyable Call of Duty in the series until BO3, in my opinion.Where do I even begin?  BO3 is like buying 3 games in one.  There is so much content, so many things to unlock, and so much FUN!  The campaign is fresh, I like how they inplemented an arcade feel to the mix.  Although I haven't beaten the game yet, only because I'm hooked on multiplayer and zombies.Multiplayer is a lot of fun, I am currently 2nd prestige.  The addition of adding characters and special powers to mix was a bold move, and it turned out to work out pretty well.  Tons of customization.  Endless replay value.I've never really played zombies before like I do now.  The new map Shadows of Evil has so much detail, and so many easter eggs to discover.  I am currently 8th prestige.I had some issues at first with match making, but it was on my end.  I didn't have my NAT settings set to OPEN, make sure you do that.  I really have no complaints, maybe some suggestions though.  Maybe you can add a lobby for zombies?  Where hosts can set lobby names and settings.  For example, ""high round run"", ""beginners welcome"" etc.Thank you Treyarch, you have a talented staff.  I can't wait for future DLC releases.  Take my money, all of it. lol"

The Multiplayer mode proves again that it is the king. And the Zombies mode gets the importance that fans were demanding.

The jump-packs are the most ridiculous thing ever (at least the stupid boost-croutch-slide is), and add an un-needed dimension to gunplay. That being said, the guns are mostly balanced. The side-arm pistols are actually useful again. Specialists are a horrible addition. Everyone now runs around as the same character. Two-faction specific outfits for each team is a much better way to go about this, like Black Ops vs CDP with NO SPECIALISTS - just soldiers, in uniform. However, if this all sounds interesting to you, then go ahead and purchase this game.But I can put all of those aside and still see the game as like a 6/10, but then there is the Black Market. Here you trade CryptoKeys or COD Points for a box containing 3 random items from weapon camos to emotes. CrytoKeys are earned through playing the game, not at a fast pace either. You will slowly be collecting these and trying to open crates. You can also pay real-world money for COD Points, which adds microtransactions to the game. This would all be fine if they didn't add actual weapons in the crates. Now, these weapons may not all be OP, but I will not support a game which adds weapons in randomized crates which you can purchase through microtransactions. This may not be ""P2W"", but it still bars people from obtaining certain weapons, which you either have to grind, grind grind, or pay until you finally get it in a box."
,Not Recommended,311210,24831238,"Posted: 11 August, 2016",all,styleee_,"This is not one of complete analysis reviews, just my personal experience of the game.I absolutely hate this game. They had 2 (or 3, not sure) years to make this, and yet they ♥♥♥♥ it up like they always do nowadays... I bought this mainly for zombies, and they manage to ♥♥♥♥ that part of the game aswellCAMPAIGNThe campaign was very confusing and therefore very unenjoyable for me atleast, but the only nice feature campaign has is that you can play with up to 4 people. I was only able to have fun when i was playing on Realistic difficulty with my friend, but it was all about the killing and dying, the story is just terribleMULTIPLAYERMultiplayer is also very boring for me, because I don't see any goal in MP anymore, im Prestige 4 and the game is just boring for me now, it's just farming levels now.. I could do Dark Matter but I think that's a lot of grinding and I'm able to play it for around an hour a day because after I play it too much I get bored and sick of it. Another annoying aspect of multiplayer is supply drops. There is a lot of reviews you can read or videos you can watch about this topic so again: I'm just going to describe how I see it. I think that supply drops are just stupid and shouldn't have been implemented into the game in first place. The problem in these Supply Drops are the weapons. In order to get them, you can buy Cryptokeys which you also get by playing, but by playing you're gonna get Cryptokeys that are gonna get you 1/2 weapons, it's kinda RNG but there is a small chance you're gonna get a weapon. As I said above, I'm Prestige 4 and only got 1 weapon that sucks♥♥♥♥♥(MX Garand) and got it from a supply drop I got for having a Season Pass (which is a money grab aswell) and the supply drop guarantees a weapon.. Yeah, they are pretty cool, but they have the same stats as normal weapons. This is good and also bad, because they can't be overpowered because that would be pay to win in a way, but when they have normal stats, you're basically paying for a normal weapon that would be free if Activision weren't such money ♥♥♥♥♥s... Of course you might not pay anything at all, or little to nothing, or spend thousands of Cryptokeys like some streamers and youtubers (obviously they get them for free). It would be perfect if the only way to obtain these weapons is just by playing, not paying, maybe make them a LITTLE stronger, or just completely remove the Supply Drops.ZOMBIESThe part of the game where I had the most fun, but again: I would have much more fun if you wouldn't have to pay for everything. The maps are okay I guess, but the thing I hate the most, is that I can't play with my friends. I can't play with them because the only map they have is the Shadows of Evil map, which by the way if you didnt figure out already: is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ The map just looks so bad in general and i don't enjoy it at all. And in order to get the other maps that I'd LOVE to play with my friends, they have to buy the stupid Season Pass for 50 euros, which is just another money grab. The maps are pretty cool, the new map Gorod Krovi looks epic but Zetsubou no Shima looks so terrible that i played it once and never played it again since then. The Giant and Der Eisendrache look epic as well, but honestly, the only map that I enjoyed is The Giant. It's because you don't have to spend an hour turning on power and unlocking Pack-a-Punch. I'd love for zombies to get back like they were in BO2. I really liked how zombies were instantly better after DLC packs came out and awesome maps like Mob of the Dead or Origins (which you just can't compare to Tranzit) came out. There's also gobblegums which I do not mind since they only make the game more enjoyable for you, and you can have some cool gobblegums just by playing, which are actually useful unlike the weapons in MP. I guess i just don't have luck to get any good one, im Prestige 2 in zombies and never got Perkaholic so i'm kinda salty about that but I don't really care that much.So that's my review, if you actually read through it (i doubt you did), i hope you can relate, maybe hit that thumbs up if you agree!"

(look at what i disliked)- the game is optimized enoughwhat i disliked about this game:- crap autobalance, you either get destroyed or you can't do a thing since your team is so overpowered- insta-kill weapons (the flame-thrower can kill you in 2 hits wtf!??)- multiplayer is pretty one-sided (only a few multiplayer modes have enough players)- black market- spray and pray moments (alot of them i promise)- the hitboxes aren't the best- graphics looks up to date but that is only because of the high-poly models and extra processsing effects that has been  added (look at the trees they are from older games)- the DLC is not the cheapest (actually rather expensive for my taste)is this game worth it in the summer sale?  meh.. but it is enough if you really want a next gen ''pew pew'' gameis this game worth it if you want to play it with a few friends? yeah!

Hardcore mode is definitely more tolerable.Zombies is where I've spent nearly all my hours in game. Its absolutely amazing and a great step from BO2 zombies (which i loved every single map). The Giant is also a great throwback and a great alternate version of Der Reise.Performance wise - this game runs very strange on older hardware. Once I upgraded my card (i was long overdue) I'm getting steady frames upwards of 190 with everything maxed out @ 150% resoluton 1080p. Locked to 60fps I've never seen it drop below that.Overall, I absolutely despise Call of Duty for their rinse and repeat nature. However, BO3 follows in suit with BO2 in providing outstanding content in a well made package and leaves it up to you to like or dislike it.

,Recommended,311210,19364221,"Posted: 29 November, 2015",all,Karis35,"It's good, does a lot of things better than Advanced Warfare and Ghosts combined.Multiplayer weapons are mostly balanced (drakon is way too spammy), specialists are fun to use and scorestreaks have more useful things than just the uav. There could be more secondary weapons though, 3 pistols and 2 launchers plus a knife is not enough. Black Ops 2 had more than that (5 pistols, 3 launchers plus a ballistic knife and a crossbow). It's fun to punch people though.The supply drop system is purely cosmetic, unlike Advanced Warfare that had kinda OP weapon variants. You earn Cryptokeys through playing which you use to buy supply drops, I think you get more from winning but if you do good you should at least get one.The campaign actually has a good story, it's not the most amazing thing ever but it's still good. Being able to customize loadouts and abilities that you can upgrade is a really fun thing to have. Also 4 player co-op that we haven't had since World at War is a really nice mechanic to have back. The new Realistic difficulty is a pain, but for me it was rewarding to finish the game with it.Zombies... Well, it's zombies."

MP gives me that mixed feeling of fun and challenging, and challenging games make themselves more fun, so when I tried playing the previous CoDs, especially the ones' before AW made me play even worse because I was too immersed in the BO3 gameplay that I forget that you can't thrust jump, slide, wall run, and swim, so it kinda gets me killed sometimes if not all the time.Sometimes I get queued with some players that have this hate on some weapons like the Drakon and the Haymaker, and some are kids rage over other kids that are camping and just won't enjoy the game as it is. Cmon guys it's a game, let other players do whatever they want to do, if you're just going to complain over something that won't be addressed by the developers then you really have to uninstall this game and other CoDs that you cried over on because you can't choose what other players' play style would be.For those of you having problems with running the game I guess you just have to accept reality and either buy a good gaming setup or just not play this game at all. Another thing is about the optimization of the game, so what if the textures aren't loading properly at least you can play it, if you really consider yourself as a gamer you won't need fancy graphics too appreciate the game, games weren't even invented to be criticized by their graphics, they were made for you to be entertained and have fun, so for those who are enjoying BO3 as it is right now ...  cheers!"

The experience is greatly improved if you have friends to play with as when playing public matches most players are either unskilled or very skilled. The problem with highly skilled players is when they get downed most immediately leave the game. Treyarch has consistently delivered interesting and innovative maps for zombies. There are sometimes issues where I cannot join my friends\' matches.In multiplayer if you don't like team deathmatch or domination you're pretty much out of luck because not enough people play the other gamemodes to consistently populate them.EDIT: Now that mods have been added I must say they are icing on the cake and I love them.

Pay to win weapons. Over powered weapons. Nothing equivalent in the shipped game. This is totally unacceptable. You can't buy the weapon. you can buy supply drops for a 0.001% chance to get the item you want. This is worse than gambling. This is totally money grabbing machine that activion has been relying on since the last COD.

Guns like the Argus, Kuda, Vesper, and others are not at all the same guns they were at launch. Weapons like the 48 Dredge and the Firebreak specialist remain untouched.The supply drop system that promotes gambling, and the over flooding of melee black market weapons. Lobbies are flooded with them and actual guns are literally becoming obsolete. I'm pretty sure there are more black market weapons now than there are in the base game.Skill based match making, which should not exist in a game where only 6,000-9,000 players are online at a time. Or really exist at all.Team balancing. I've actually been in lobbies where the final score is something ludicrous like 100-10. A close game is non existant.DLC being useless for multiplayer, as for some reason Treyarch decided to give them their own playlists instead of putting the maps in Core/Hardcore. The DLC playlists are deserted. I've never been on a single DLC map in public matchmaking.Weapons are simply weak as a general statement. 4 shots to kill on a gun that fires at ~750RPM, and still has high recoil? And combined with lag compensation, it's impossible to use some of these guns.Zombies maps being overly complicated to the point where you spend more time watching YouTube tutorials about them rather than actually playing and enjoying them.Dr. Monty's Factory promoting gambling.The campaign trying to be its own Matrix/Inception and failing badly.Train go boom.Has nothing to do with the WaW story arc despite being called ""Black Ops."" (and no, the fact that Khalil mentions Menendez once does not count)Some parts/aspects of the campaign being blatantly ripped off from other games.AS A GENERAL STATEMENTHorrible optimization. You need a beast PC to run this game well, or else you have to play on lower than low settings (720p, %90 render resolution). A bit ridiculous for a game with 2013 graphics.Safely launching/closing the game takes far too long.I don't remember how many GBs, but the game also takes a gigantic amount of storage.EDIT: Not a problem for me since I bought the Season Pass awhile ago with gift money, but why can't you buy the DLC packs individually? Forcing people to fork out $50 for DLC on a full price game? Are you guys serious? Do you want people to just stop buying your games? Because that's how you make people stop buying your games.------------------Wanting this game is like wanting to jump off a building and land on a bunch of homeless orphans, killing you and said orphans. This game is the epitome of a dirty scam that gets its way because its a name brand CoD game. The only good thing I got from it was the knowledge I should never trust Activision/Treyarch (no, Treyarch is not innocent.) if my life depended on it."

The graphics are good for COD but compared to other games it is nothing special and the sound design is ok making the guns sound like guns. The guns also feel different but this is because they shoot at different speeds and nothing else. Now the gameplay. It unbalanced and terrible; i have been in a game where you must use 2-3 guns or you are at a sever disadvantage. This game is inconsistent with burst guns sometimes taking 2 bursts to kill and othdr times taking 5 bursts and you can not say that it is because health because I have played this game for 64 hours and when you stumble or spawns change so you are in the enemys spawn then one guy takes 1 burst to kill and the other takes 4-5. The netcode is terrible with trading being common place. I thought that because this was the most popular shooter at this point would have something oter than being a game with guns but it is AND THERE AREN'T EVEN MANY GUNS WITH 4-5 IN MOST GUNS TYPES. To compare Battlefield 4 has 12-14 guns in each section.......IN EACH SECTION. The peformance on PC is really bad; I can play GTA 5 on highest settings with 120 frames but this game will make me drop frames if I get into a fire fight where the enemy is within arms reach. I may be a salty child but it is because this game is unbalanced, a slap in the face to the FPS gaming industry and is lacking in content............. also the campaign is short and bad......... and so is zombies.

The movements of black ops 3 feel good, you feel you are playing COD, even if it is somehow different.-Graphics are bad at low, but really good in high end pcNeither good or bad:-Dlcs can't be bought separatelly. That's bad cause season pass is obviously more expensive, but on the other side, it helps matchmaking being better.-Campaign is not really good, and the voice acting is medium, but it's not bad either.

That's not kind of a good right but it's the minimum for a good play quality.

,Recommended,311210,25575084,"Posted: 18 September, 2016",all,dm me horse pics,"Summary: Black Ops III is a smooth, balanced fps that suffers from a lack of players and a less-than-ideal supply drop system. (This mostly focuses on multiplayer, but the campaign is loads of fun and the zombies is probably the most replayable and enjoyable experience yet.)This game is really fun. I mean, really fun. The gunplay is smooth, the new wallrunning and boost jump mechanics are both intuitive and dynamic, and the specialists add a totally new aspect to COD that really spices up the gameplay. After numerous patches, the guns are well-balanced, offering all kinds of styles for all kinds of players, and the create-a-class system is very smooth, with the 10 point system returning from Black Ops II. The maps are all fairly good, with plenty of flanking and pushing opportunities, and all the gamemodes fit very well into the map. The only problem is - if one would consider this a problem - is that the maps are all very copy-paste in terms of layout: a three-lane system that can get old pretty fast, but is predicable enough so an experienced player can exploit the sometimes unfair spawn system.All of that is good, and if you've played other COD games, then you'll probably pick this one up pretty quickly. Although boots on the ground supporters will say that the new mechanics ruin gameplay, I personally think it encourages more movement as opposed to camping, and it opens up so many new ways to have fun. It's less aggressive and fast-paced than Advanced Warfare, but it strikes a great balance in my opinion between fluidity, speed, and control.The real problems are the players and the supply drop system. The players aren't caustic or anything, but there just aren't enough of them. I don't know if it's a popularity issue or the audience has died down, but it takes forever to join a lobby by yourself, and just forget about having a party. No one plays DLC maps two days after release, so the season pass is pretty much useless since Nuk3town is free for everyone. The supply drop system, whether it's Activision's or Treyarch's fault no one knows, but it just makes the game feel futile. No matter how good you get, you're never guaranteed a weapon. You'll mostly get duplicate common skins for that one gun you never use, and some humping taunt for that specialist you don't care about. It's demoralizing more than anything, and it makes you envious of other players when they run around with their cool stuff you just won't get.All that said, however, this game is worth it. It's a quality fps, and you'll have fun whether you're good or not. I'm not really that good to be honest, but there's so much there to work for that for a completionist like me, you'll easily spend hundreds of hours grinding for that camo or calling card.

For a light gamer, it is fresh and exciting for serval months before you need to buy DLCs to extend your fun with it. However, after the releasing of mod tool (still in open beta), many custom maps and modes became available free. More has yet to come especially those amazing ones that take more effort and time to make. If you search custom maps for Call of Duty World at War, you would be surprised how many of them have been created and played by players over the last 7 years. Unfortunately, Activision and Treyarch did not provide mod support for neither Black Ops 1 nor Black Ops 2 so rarely anyone still play these two games now. Nevertheless, with official mod tool support and steam workshop support for BO3, we can expect this game maintain a good level of popularity for another 5 years or more as its older predecessor (CODwaw)."

For the first time with three-years of development, the revered, award-winning studio has created its first title for next-gen hardware in the critically acclaimed Black Ops series. Welcome to Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, a dark, twisted future where a new breed of Black Ops soldier emerges and the lines are blurred between our own humanity and the technology we created to stay ahead, in a world where cutting-edge military robotics define warfare.Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 combines three unique game modes: Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies, providing fans with the deepest and most ambitious Call of Duty ever. The Campaign has been designed as a co-op game that can be played with up to 4 players online or as a solo cinematic thrill-ride. Multiplayer will be the franchise’s deepest, most rewarding and most engaging to date, with new ways to rank up, customize, and gear up for battle. And Zombies delivers an all-new mind-blowing experience with its own dedicated narrative. Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 can be played entirely online, and for the first time each of the offerings has its own unique player XP and progression systems. The title ushers in an unprecedented level of innovation, including jaw-dropping environments, never before experienced weaponry and abilities, and the introduction of a new, improved fluid movement system. All of this is brought to life by advanced technology custom crafted for this title, including new AI and animation systems, and graphics that redefine the standards Call of Duty fans have come to expect from the critically-acclaimed series, with cutting edge lighting systems and visual effects.INTRODUCING A NEW ERA OF BLACK OPS:Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 deploys its players into a future where bio-technology has enabled a new breed of Black Ops soldier. Players are now always on and always connected to the intelligence grid and their fellow operatives during battle. In a world more divided than ever, this elite squad consists of men and women who have enhanced their combat capabilities to fight faster, stronger, and smarter. Every soldier has to make difficult decisions and visit dark places in this engaging, gritty narrative.A CALL OF DUTY CAMPAIGN UNLIKE ANYTHING BEFORE IT:Treyarch elevates the Call of Duty social gaming experience by delivering a campaign with the ability to play cooperatively with up to four players online, using the same battle-tested network infrastructure and social systems that support its world-class Multiplayer and Zombies game modes. Designed for co-op and re-playability, players encounter all the epic cinematic gameplay moments Call of Duty is known for delivering as well as new open-area arena-style gameplay elements designed to allow players to approach the game with a different strategy each time they play. And now, every player is completely customizable: from weapons and loadouts, to abilities and outfits, all with full progression systems and a personalized armory to show off accomplishments, providing a constantly-evolving campaign experience.PREPARE FOR A LEVELED-UP MULTIPLAYER:With Black Ops 3, Treyarch premieres a new momentum-based chained-movement system, allowing players to fluidly move through the environment with finesse, using controlled thrust jumps, slides, and mantling abilities in a multitude of combinations, all while maintaining complete control over your weapon at all times. Maps are designed from the ground-up for the new movement system, allowing players to be successful with traditional movement, as well as advanced tactics and maneuvers.Black Ops 3 multiplayer also introduces the new Specialist character system, which allows players to rank up and master each specific character’s battle-hardened capabilities and weapons. With this addition to Traditional and Weapons XP progressions systems, Black Ops 3 multiplayer gives players three different ways to rank up.FIGHT THE UNDEAD IN AN ALL-NEW HORROR STORY:No Treyarch title would be complete without its signature Zombies offering – a full-game experience with its own distinct storyline right out of the box. Black Ops 3 Zombies is the most immersive and ambitious Call of Duty Zombies to date, with a full XP-based progression system for players that adds depth and re-playability to the engaging gameplay Zombies fans have come to expect.Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 delivers the ultimate 3-games-in-1 experience."

Firstly, supply drops, everybody's favourite topic. I think they were absolutley fine whe the game was first launch, hell even the melee weapons were fine. Then the scum that is Activision saw the decline in supply drop sales compared to advanced warfare and forced Treyarch to add in pay to win weapons to increase sales. Pay-to-win systems in a $100 game (where I live) with a $70 season pass is very unacceptable, those are only acceptable in very cheap games like cs:go or free-to-play games. The supply drops got me tired of multiplayer much quicker than if the game would have gone without them. Seeing people with guns that I don't have access to despite the fact that I have spent almost $200 is very annoying. Also, on console there are frame drop issues that only started occuring after the latest patch. Lastly for the bad things, the campaign was a little bad in my opinion, not because of the story but because some of the gameplay mechanics just didn't feel like it should be in a story mode and rather, an arcade game. On the other hand, multiplayer is still a decent amount of fun every once and a while and zombies is just absolutley increadable. Although the final map Revelations was disappointing because of its lack of innovation as a final map, it is still fun to play. All of the other maps are also amazing (Besides Zetsobou of course). The bonus modes are great too, freerun, nightmares mode and best of all, dead ops arcade 2. But by far the most exciting thing is the mod tools. With mod tools there are endless possiblities to what people can do in multipayer and zombies and it will increase the life of black ops 3 for atleast a few years like it did with world at war. Overall, there are some stupid and bad things in this game but the good things easily out-weigh the bad. 8.5/10"

I despised the series so much that i refused to ever play one of their games again. The last Cod I played was MW3, which I put hours into, but felt it was too much like BO1. It was at this point I stopped playing the series.Over time, I started to see more and more gameplay for this, and decided to give it a try. Let me just say Treyarch really outdid themselves here. This is definatly the best FPS i've played all year, and in my opinion, the best COD. Although it is showing more and more elements from other series like Destiny, Halo, etc... They balanced it extremly well altogether so it doesn't feel choppy. The leveling systems are incredably balanced and there is a clear motivation to keep playing. If you are on the fence about buying this, just get it."

The sliding, thrusters and all that add an element to multiplayer that boosts gameplay so much more than the other CoDs. Stuff like the Black Market, Specializations and such also bring something new to the table, and are all well made and balanced. Zombies is much more story-oriented this time, with the only downside for me being that only one map is available without DLC. Campaign is extensive and features a twisting and quite confusing plot, but interesting nonethless.I think I'm partly persuaded in favour of this game seeing as I skipped CoD: AW, and for me this game feels like a fresh addition to the series.All the negative reviews based solely on performance issues and bugs are redundant for me, I've not had any issues besides 2 bugs that have actually been beneficial, and my GTX 970 handles the game perfectly on highest settings (which looks amazing).Nonetheless, all CoDs are very much the same, and are good games to load up for a few hours, then move onto something else."

Shame on you Treyarch! I was anxious to see if the campaign revolved around the original four or maybe somehow intertwined the fates of Black Ops 2 four with original four, but nope! IT WAS A ♥♥♥♥ING COPY/ PASTE. ♥♥♥♥ YOU TREYARCH. THAT IS SUPREME ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T. I've loved Zombies mode since I first played Nacht der Untoten on World at War and spent endless hours going for the high round on Der Riese. Finding out that the Zombies campaign was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t afterthought made me extremely upset.Shadows of Evil was extremely well done in it's own respects. The characters are a fresh departure from the Black Ops 2 Zombie crew. The Giant map was a tear jerker for me because of so many fond memories it brought up. I have yet to play the other four maps but am anxiously awaiting the chance to when I can find the time to download and devote some real hours to it.Multiplayer was surprisingly easy for me to get into, considering I was going into it thinking that I was going to hate it.Campaign is really fun in it's own right and I really enjoy the customization thatit offers.Overall I give Black Ops III a strong 6/10. Enjoyable but still a few things keeping me from devoting more time into it. Only really enjoyable for me if I play with friends."

And hey this is Treyarch! They made World at War and BOII. Truly this will be a good one! RIGHT?!Meh.(This review is going to be focused on the campaign of the game)I will say I was surprised and impressed that this included character and weapon customization. I mean it's bare bones (other than weapon customization; it's okay). You pick pre set faces and choose from armor you unlock throughout the story.Oh the story. It was pretty bad, at least in the beginning. The game starts SO ♥♥♥♥ING SLOW. You fight this boring, hilariously named force called The Immortals. They all looked like angsty teens and wear the dumbest looking armor. Some of them have these fat♥♥♥♥♥goggles on their head. I chuckled every time I encountered them.Later on the campaign gets interesting (by later I mean 5 to 6 missions. Keep in mind these missions are LONG, like 40 minutes each at the least). The game builds tension fairly well between the player and their AI companion and it introduces an intriguing enemy that I did want to learn more about. Too bad it followed the most predictable conclusion.Microsoft Word gone rogue.Not to mention that the missions are boring and repetitive. Nothing sticks out. There's no charging tanks while your riding a horse (BOII) or crawling through a mass grave as a Russian soldier (World at War). The story heavily relies on its characters. Too bad they were never developed and you're just supposed to buy their friendship. Like that *best friend* from AW. There are also no choices that affect the outcome of the story. That was present in BOII, so why isn’t it here? It really could’ve helped the game.I will say the character deaths were cool and fun to watch.Really this one is a skip. I actually recommend Ghosts over this because that game is just ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious and entertaining. If you want a good COD game get World At War, 4, BOII, COD 1 or II. I can't recommend this one especially at its atrocious file size. Apparently the DLC files are downloaded whether you own them or not.Press F to pick a better game."

(im reviewing this 1st November 2016) This game has lots of good aspects that make the simply fun. In my opinion the game i poorly optimized for pc and poorly made but that is what makes it fun. One of the fun things in this game is Uplink. it is like American football but you run to the enemy goal with a ball and throw the ball into the goal or simply jump into it. Zombies was pretty good on here, not the best because the maps have poor replay value. My favorite map from black ops 3 has to be Gorod Krovi because it combines elements from World at War and other zombies games into the map. i got one word for the campaign : HORRIBLE. it has no relation at all to the other black ops games, except for ONE mention of Menendez.But Overall i do recommend this game"

,Recommended,311210,21719000,"Posted: 8 March, 2016",all,Actavis™,"My teammate's in game character congratulated me when I leveled up.He then killed me with a lightning strike a few minutes later.This game is poorly optimized, not all the time, but in certain parts of maps or when different events happen etc. When the game is not in one of these states, it runs very well. Now it runs well on high end gaming PCs. I can say that when I played the beta, I was running a GTX 570 and couldnt play the game at minimal settings. Now I have a 980 TI and it runs how any game ever should run on that kind of card.The playerbase isn't your average COD playerbase. The community is smaller because of the limitations on who can actually run the game and the fact that COD isn't as big on the PC (as CSGO or TF2 etc). This means not many squakers. The hardcore community is even more compact. I mainly stick to hardcore and will regularly see the same dedicated players and little relationships have formed over that. The guns feel solid with attachments and feel a little wonky without, which is great because the attachments actually drastically improve the performance of the gun with each level up. The attachments are pretty much the same as BO2 and all modern shooters but that is more because of what is acceptable and usable on modern day weapons so that isn't much of a gripe. There is noticibly more shake/movement on sights like the reflex. I enjoy this because most shooters put huge shake on snipers and then have a static sight on all other kinds of weapons. There are some new ideas here with guns. For instance, a three round burst laser sniper rifle (which has to be charged)  and a seven round burst LMG.The maps are more focused on player channeling rather than an open map. There are certain paths you can go which lead to a certain place and you cant really take shortcuts or get there by jumping over a wall or something. It is nice because you sort of know where the enimies will generally be and you dont have to worry about some dude perched in the trees somewhere random. But this limits snipers very greatly. There arent mant open areas where snipers can be effective. If you're playing hardcore, you're gonna need a fully automatic.The specialist system is great. Well the idea is great. There are nine specialists with two abilities each. This makes for eighteen different play styles. They are varied greatly and provide definite buffs which apply to different situations. You can level up your specialist for more armour and camos and eventually unlock sound bytes that tell you about their past. There are definetly some specialists that are more viable in certain game modes and in general, but some tweaking can fix that. I would like to see new specialists in the future though (like R6S).The Black Market system is really nice. You open up cases (which has become a gaming norm) and get three items varying in rarity. These items can be weapon skins, varients to weapon attachments (which are only cosmetic I think), calling cards and emblems, shapes or textures for custom skins or emblems, specialist armour camo, specialist taunts, and brand new weapons that are only available via random drop in the black market. This system is very balanced. For 10 cryptokeys, you can unbox a common crate with more of a chance to get common or uncommon items. For 30 cryptokeys, you can unbox a rare case that has more of a chance for rare items. Cryptokeys are only available by playing the game. You will get at least one or one and a half cryptokeys per match and if you do well, you may get three or more.Overall, I wish there were more maps and specialists but this game is one of the best, if not the best, Call of Duty games I have played."

,Not Recommended,311210,19026537,"Posted: 11 November, 2015",all,XTChrisTX,"Not for $79.99, anyway. Don't get me wrong, Black Ops III is a good game. But Black Ops II was a great game... and for $79.99 (Canadian launch price), Black Ops III better blow it out of the water.Let's start with the good. You can choose your character's gender! I never thought I'd see this in Call of Duty of all places, but here it is. I don't see her becoming as popular as FemShep, though, because while the voice acting is serviceable, it's not exceptional. The male voice is Ben Browder, so unless he phoned in his lines it's not going to be terrible like Mark Meer's Shepard.There are other women in the game, and female enemies as well, and they're realistic and not heavily sexualized. Of course, they get beat up and blown up like their male counterparts, too. As Trudeau would say, it's 2015. I'm not trying to damn by faint praise- sexism in video games is a big issue and I think Black Ops III took a big, bold step forward here.Gameplay. Probably the best in any Call of Duty game I've played (basically all except Advanced Warfare and some early console exclusives), with some minor issues here and there. You have various abilities now, kind of like Bioshock Infinite or Mass Effect. In fact, they're probably ripped straight out of those games, but I'll get to that later.You also have an advanced HUD that shows you where enemies are and what's shooting at you, which sounds like a bit of a cheat but doesn't feel like it in game. It's still pretty linear and pretty closed, but combat is fast paced and satisfying. Let's be clear- this is nothing groundbreaking, but there are some good additions to the formula.So what are the minor issues? There's a flying mission. It's even worse than the one in Black Ops II. You unlock new abilities, weapons, and attachments as the game progresses. While the sense of progression is nice, you start with very little compared to what was available in Black Ops II. And there are occasional points in the game where you'll have to hunt down something that's almost impossible to find, or make it through a ridiculous segment without dying because there aren't enough checkpoints, or just fight an obscene number of enemies. But these are pretty minor and rare.In other words, the best part of Black Ops III is gameplay. And it's got quite a bit- eight hours isn't long compared to, say, Fallout, but it's one of the longest Call of Duty campaigns to date.The story is... bad. It's not as bad as Ghosts (the worst in Call of Duty history in my opinion), but it's not good. Mostly, it's too ambitious. Modern Warfare didn't promise much and it didn't have trouble delivering. Black Ops always promised more- the first one was a mixed bag but the second one actually delivered.Black Ops III reaches far and falls hard. I don't want to spoil it, but the storyline of Black Ops III is incredibly cliched and quite poorly done. It tries to be a kind of cerebral sci-fi, but it doesn't actually bring up issues very often and when it does it just kind of glosses over them. It juggles themes, unsure of what it actually wants to say. It came across as really pretentious, to be honest, and more or less stopped making sense near the end. In other words, while Black Ops II was focused, Black Ops III is all over the place.But, maybe how a story is told matters more than the story itself. Too bad Black Ops III flubs that, too.There are a few big issues with storytelling. The first is atmosphere. Modern Warfare felt epic. Black Ops II felt personal. Black Ops III feels... well, kind of floundering. It's neither epic nor personal, just kind of flat.The second is investment. You don't really invest into any of the characters, because we know nothing about any of them. Black Ops II had two games to build this, but Black Ops III never really does.You don't really invest into the world, either, because we know exactly nothing about it. Your side is the Winslow Accord, which has something to do with bio-augmentation. On the other side is the NRC, which I'm assuming is not actually the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but it might as well be because I think the exapnsion of the abbreviation was stated only once and I missed it. This is a future where everyone's watched, bio-engineering is commonplace, and there have been cataclysmic events around the globe. But you only ever see tiny slices of it and there just isn't enough context given.Speaking generally, although it's added a lot of new stuff, Black Ops III is missing almost everything that made its predecessor so great. There are no decisions like you had in Black Ops II and the story isn't dynamic. While that's not necessarily a bad thing- there are plenty of great games that are entirely static- it feels like a step backwards. Story-wise, it doesn't have the focused personal narrative of BO2, the relevant near-future world of BO2, or the historical connections of the other two Black Ops games.Black Ops III doesn't really feel like it should be Black Ops III, or even Call of Duty at all. It doesn't connect with the other Black Ops games in any significant way, and if it wasn't for a single blatant mention you wouldn't even know it was in the same universe. The lack of continuity is really disappointing in particular, because Black Ops II did such a good job of following up on the first game.As for being a Call of Duty game, it's too sci-fi, not so much in setting but in theme, to be Call of Duty. It's too cerebral- or at least it tries to be- and it doesn't really fit the mold of Call of Duty games in terms of narrative structure. It's not pushing boundaries in the way Black Ops II did, it just... doesn't feel like Call of Duty.I haven't tried multiplayer at all. If it's good, and if multiplayer is your thing, then maybe Black Ops III is worth full price. But I don't know, and I don't play much.A quick word on technical aspects. Usually, I don't say much about these, because it's rarely in the forefront of my mind and that means it's at least good enough. Black Ops III looks pretty good, but you'll need a beefy system to crank the settings up- my 770 does a decent job at high (not ultra) at 1080p with the antialiasing backed off, but it does lag at times. The infamous stuttering seems to have been fixed- I didn't notice any of it. The sound design is still inferior to what Infinity Ward pulled off with Modern Warfare 3 in 2011- notably, suppressed weapons are often louder than non-suppressed ones. And the music... well, it unsurprisingly sounds like Mass Effect, and it's serviceable but not as good as previous Call of Duty games.Is it worth playing? I think it is. The gameplay is solid, and it does bring some interesting new stuff to the table. But wait for a sale. It may be the most expensive game in the series, but it's far from the best."

,Not Recommended,311210,19022944,"Posted: 11 November, 2015",all,BlackSoul,"It was a positive review since November 2015, but unfortunately I have to change to negative.I really enjoyed this game, and while most of players would blame this game for unoptimized graphics or lags, I was promoting it and personally didn't experience any such issues.It has amazing graphics, very nice and practic dynamics/mechanics, more or less balanced weapons, non trivial maps and many other lovely features I liked so much.There are two conditions however which are artificially generated by developers which simply ruin this game and bring it to a slow death:1) Manual game bans?First I want to say that it's true that this game has a good anticheat. For 770 hours of my gameplay I saw very little cheaters in this game, to be more precise I saw 3 cheaters, saved their steam profile links and after some period of time found out VAC bans on their profiles. It gave me a very big confidence that this game is fair, that cheaters will be banned and fair players will not be harmed.However a week ago I've created another steam profile and started BO3 from zero. Spent around 20 hours to get to first prestige. There's no wonder that a new player getting many kills or handling objectives (like S&D) will be suspected for cheating and there were many reports obviously.And a day ago I've found out that my profile recieved a ""game ban"" (not a VAC ban), obviously given by a human moderator. (Here is the profile:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198233855640/)Now I know from my personal experience that this game has moderators which punish new accounts for a good score.It's possible that the reason of ban was not related to cheats, but to the fact that it was a smurf account or a boosting attempt. But think about it, if tomorrow your steam account is stolen and you start BO3 on a new profile will it be fair to punish you for that?It should be a skill based game, not a ""look at my fancy weapon skin"" or ""look at my steam level"" or ""look how much money i spent on cryptokeys"" game.And if you have a good anti-cheat which automatically gives VAC bans why would you bother giving manual ""game ban""-s? Isn't it obvious that at least some of manual bans are doomed to be invalid?Just knowing that there's a manual ban and one day it may hit you makes many professional players to drop BO3.2) Dedicated Servers?Yeah, they were finally introduced. But the way they were implemented this system is simply dead. Other than one or two modded servers to check some new stuff there's nothing else.It's sad that BO3 developers and moderators act in this way, let's see how will it affect the community after some period of time..."

,Recommended,311210,32862113,Posted: 27 June,all,Fugliest of Socks | Commend,"TLDR; Overall it's actually a really solid game and I would recommend it.Pros:-Zombies, everything about it--> customisable guns that impact both visuals and performance in game--> gobblegum system throws in wildcards midgame (helps you clutch)--> incredible graphics, with neglibible lag (running GTX 970, getting 60FPS) even on max settings--> there is new content quite often--> prestige system for zombies!-Multiplayer--> games range from fast-paced to slower modes--> good server performance--> lots of aesthetics for weapons--> special unlockable weapons from previous black ops game (like the famas and galil!)-Campaign--> I haven't finished it yet, but I can already tell there is replayability because I've tried to 100% the first bloody mission like 10 times--> a really cool prestige system--> personally, I liked the ''cyber'' aspect of it with all the abilities you can choose from. From offensive and mitigation playstyles to stealth mode, these abilites cover it all and are really helpful/not broken--> the story so far is quite trippy, mentally, but definitely has some shape to it and a path-Miscellanious--> they brought back dead ops arcade--> ""Nightmares"" mode legitimately scared me a few times (playing at night with sound...ya know) and it was really cool to see the completely different graphics on the maps. Nightmares mode makes you play through some campaign maps with a twist- it's zombies. Mix multiplayer with zombies and you get this. Really cool.--> Free-running was a nice addition, definitely helped me maneuver my way through multiplayer games and the campaign. Nice maps with different skill levels...although in the end they were all fairly easy to beat.--> double exp weekends/events happen frequentlyCons-Zombies--> I purchased the ""season's pass"" expecting everything to be free...considering the game then cost me over $100, but DLC5 (with all the old remastered maps) will cost me an additional $30. Not too pleased about this.--> The timer for the lobbies for when the game starts is way too short (3 seconds). I understand the 10 second delay was tedious in black ops 1 and a lot of players would leave, but now because it's so short you will get games about 40% of the time where there is an AFK person who then leaves on round 5 thus ruining your game. My suggestion is to include a matchmaking penalty for players who leave within the first 2 minutes of the game starting.-Multiplayer--> OK, personal opinion here, but I think the prestige system is clunky here and not very rewarding. I don't see too many benefits to doing this and the option is rather hidden away beneath options and menus.--> Again, my opinion, did not feel like a traditional black ops style multiplayer. This is much more like ghosts or something weird.--> Some special agent skills are way too overpowered, some are way too underpowered. A lot of them don't get used as a result so there definitely needs to be some tweaking here.-Campaign--> not too much to say here, I haven't finished it yet. Perhaps a better storyline and intro would be beneficial, rather than throwing you into the game (that's what multiplayer is for)Miscellanious--> dead ops arcade is very unpopular and it's really rare for me to find anyone who wants to matchmake - contrary to black ops 1--> would like to see more compatability and customisation options with chroma keyboards and co.In the end, I bought it for zombies, played the sh*t out of it, moved onto multiplayer, raged the sh*t out of it, continued to the campaign, did not finish (this sh*t out of?) it, then went back to zombies to chill out for a bit.Solid game, buy it, 9/10."

The steam workshop community are making amazing maps, weapons and even gamemodes, that sometimes feel as if the developers actually made it. In the zombies mode without a doubt there is always something to do, high rounds challenges, quite intricate easter eggs and leveling up systems for everygame mode. Multiplayer wise, this is the first game that introduced the whole boosters/parkour mechanics, personally I pefer boots on the ground as it give fair opportunity and gameplay for any player. As for the mirco transactions (supply drops) It is optional, it doesn't make a difference in my experience if you got a dlc weapon, everyone can get them, it's up to the player to buy or grind if they wish. I highly recommend this game, as it gives a promising start to the next Call OF Dutys, if you love the series, give it a shot at least. :D"

I have to say from the graphics to the gameplay to the amount of content and customization this game delivers. It really is like having three games in one. I have not ran into any bugs or performance issues and the gunplay is buttery smooth. I have 8 hours of play time two days in and got to play splittscreen with my son. There is so much fun to be had here.

Multiplayer gets stale prety fast from my experience, and campaign fails to convey the messages it's going for (alongside other issues). Because of this, if you're a fan of the typical Treyarch CoD Zombies style then I'd say pick it up when the Digital Deluxe is down to at least $65, even then that's a pretty large price unless you really like zombies. However, if you're looking for a story or multiplayer experience I'd say to not bother with it."

The game plays well and feels like call of duty in the future. Zombies is the reason i got this game and the additon of mod tools makes it better with custom zombies coming back since the cod 5 days (WAW). The multiplayer is alright even though they added guns you haver to pay for if you want them at the moment they come out. But other than that the multiplayer is good and the one thing that sucks is not many people play mulitplayer but cod is more for console gamers anyways. If you were to buy this game wait till it goes on sale or find it for cheap on♥♥♥♥♥or some other site. I would rate this a 9.4/10 because the graphics and the style of the game make the game great.

For the first time with three-years of development, the revered, award-winning studio has created its first title for next-gen hardware in the critically acclaimed Black Ops series. Welcome to Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, a dark, twisted future where a new breed of Black Ops soldier emerges and the lines are blurred between our own humanity and the technology we created to stay ahead, in a world where cutting-edge military robotics define warfare.Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 combines three unique game modes: Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies, providing fans with the deepest and most ambitious Call of Duty ever. The Campaign has been designed as a co-op game that can be played with up to 4 players online or as a solo cinematic thrill-ride. Multiplayer will be the franchise’s deepest, most rewarding and most engaging to date, with new ways to rank up, customize, and gear up for battle. And Zombies delivers an all-new mind-blowing experience with its own dedicated narrative. Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 can be played entirely online, and for the first time each of the offerings has its own unique player XP and progression systems. The title ushers in an unprecedented level of innovation, including jaw-dropping environments, never before experienced weaponry and abilities, and the introduction of a new, improved fluid movement system. All of this is brought to life by advanced technology custom crafted for this title, including new AI and animation systems, and graphics that redefine the standards Call of Duty fans have come to expect from the critically-acclaimed series, with cutting edge lighting systems and visual effects.INTRODUCING A NEW ERA OF BLACK OPS:Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 deploys its players into a future where bio-technology has enabled a new breed of Black Ops soldier. Players are now always on and always connected to the intelligence grid and their fellow operatives during battle. In a world more divided than ever, this elite squad consists of men and women who have enhanced their combat capabilities to fight faster, stronger, and smarter. Every soldier has to make difficult decisions and visit dark places in this engaging, gritty narrative.A CALL OF DUTY CAMPAIGN UNLIKE ANYTHING BEFORE IT:Treyarch elevates the Call of Duty social gaming experience by delivering a campaign with the ability to play cooperatively with up to four players online, using the same battle-tested network infrastructure and social systems that support its world-class Multiplayer and Zombies game modes. Designed for co-op and re-playability, players encounter all the epic cinematic gameplay moments Call of Duty is known for delivering as well as new open-area arena-style gameplay elements designed to allow players to approach the game with a different strategy each time they play. And now, every player is completely customizable: from weapons and loadouts, to abilities and outfits, all with full progression systems and a personalized armory to show off accomplishments, providing a constantly-evolving campaign experience.PREPARE FOR A LEVELED-UP MULTIPLAYER:With Black Ops 3, Treyarch premieres a new momentum-based chained-movement system, allowing players to fluidly move through the environment with finesse, using controlled thrust jumps, slides, and mantling abilities in a multitude of combinations, all while maintaining complete control over your weapon at all times. Maps are designed from the ground-up for the new movement system, allowing players to be successful with traditional movement, as well as advanced tactics and maneuvers.Black Ops 3 multiplayer also introduces the new Specialist character system, which allows players to rank up and master each specific character’s battle-hardened capabilities and weapons. With this addition to Traditional and Weapons XP progressions systems, Black Ops 3 multiplayer gives players three different ways to rank up.FIGHT THE UNDEAD IN AN ALL-NEW HORROR STORY:No Treyarch title would be complete without its signature Zombies offering – a full-game experience with its own distinct storyline right out of the box. Black Ops 3 Zombies is the most immersive and ambitious Call of Duty Zombies to date, with a full XP-based progression system for players that adds depth and re-playability to the engaging gameplay Zombies fans have come to expect.Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 delivers the ultimate 3-games-in-1 experience.System RequirementsMINIMUM:OS: Windows 7 64-Bit / Windows 8 64-Bit / Windows 8.1 64-BitProcessor: Intel® Core™ i3-530 @ 2.93 GHz / AMD Phenom™ II X4 810 @ 2.60 GHzMemory: 6 GB RAMGraphics: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 470 @ 1GB / ATI® Radeon™ HD 6970 @ 1GBDirectX: Version 11Network: Broadband Internet connectionStorage: 60 GB available spaceSound Card: DirectX Compatible"

I had heard nothing but trouble from other people on the internet, so I felt like I was finally given something back, since my computer never seems to get things right the first time.Then I started playing through the campaign and I enjoyed it. I felt like the map design could of been more open, but the different ""power-ups"" provided some opportunity for variety. When I was on the final mission I was screaming in my head ""Make it stop"", because I just wanted the fighting to stop :PAnd once I made it through that, I went on to the multiplayer and that was cool too. Solid 0.4 K/D, but I don't mind. I don't expect to be better than anyone, so the kills I get still fill me with joy.And then they started updating the game, and thus removed my ability to play the game. It didn't start anymore. So I uninstalled it and came back a couple months later, only to find the following updates made no difference for me. But eventually I could play and enjoy it again.

My biggest reason for getting this game would be zombies.  I LOVE zombies, and playing any of the maps on solo is lots of fun.  However, playing this game online in any gamemode sucks but especially when it comes to zombies.  I would say 75% of the time everyone quits the game because of lag or the game itself doesn't even start before going back to main menu.  When you are lucky to get in game with some people, you usually will experience performance issues and or lag and you will want to try because the game is actually running and you found people to play with but the gameplay will be awful.  My next big issue is that no one plays this game.    PC is my main platform for gaming but this year I decided instead of playing COD on console I would try it on PC, what could go wrong.  Well it runs terrible (as discussed) but also NO ONE freaking plays the game it seems.  You can usually find people in TDM or Nuketown (when up) in multiplayer, and thats it.  So all those extra game modes on there, goodluck finding someone to play with to even try them out, unless your lucky and the Nuketown maps include it.  I loved all the other Black ops games and WAW, but this game I cannot recommend anyone spend any money on it unless on sale and even then it wouldn't be low enough of a price to recommend because there will be even less people playing it by then.  Overall, I am very dissapointed by this game as it had so much promise but never lived up to its full potential.  The early access feature for PS4 on the map packs is BULL, I shouldn't have to pay the same price as others for the season pass when I have to wait a month before getting it, but that has been an issue for awhile when Xbox was getting it before that.  I love FPS games, and sadly will continue playing this here and there, but if someone were to ask me if they should buy this, I would have to say NO."

Please consider all the other reviews confirming terrible unplayable servers, issues with certain graphics cards like my new gtx 980 @ 10 fps. Very happy with steam i was playing 2hrs 26mins and they refunded me within 30mins. So aside from my issues that i would safely say would be slowly ironed out after launch the base game £39.99 only has 1 zombie map?? But of course day one dlc for 74.99 so you can get a grand total of 2 zombie maps. I bought this game almost solely because i loved zombies, i feel slapped in the face but happy they have not got my money. Coz c'mon i'd only play this game until fallout came out and would prob never play it again. But in summary i'm glad this experience will finally have me out of the annual call of duty refresh, they have taken the dlc too far this time 39.99 only buys half a game if you liked zombies, almost twice the price if you want the other 50% spoon fed to you for the rest of the year.

One thing that really makes me furious is that progession is separate for offline and online modes, okay at first this sounds okay but when you play SINGLE PLAYER campaign and get disconnect, you lose all your checkpoint and have to start the level all over again.. but that is considered lucky as when the server is not ready, you have to change to offline modes and START FROM THE BEGINNING! maybe their decision can be justified if the campaign is easy for other player to hop in during the mission but no... You have to be in lobby prior that.Anyway rambling aside the campaign still sucks without the connection problem. Shallow story compared to previous black ops and no innovation aside from co op campaign (that fells like an aftertought)Multiplayer is fine, typical call of dutyAllthough zombies mode is good... try to imagine yourself when you get into the furthest wave you can and get disconnect..Maybe this is because I play in Asia, so I cannot speak to other people in other region.

Now in call of duty black ops three there is a way to turn off controller aim assist, but no way of disabling Target assist so every time my crosshairs go over an enemy it locks onto to them. I can aim by my self treyarch i don't need the game doing it for me!Okay that was kind of a rant but it does annoy me some times when games add aim assist and target assist and there is no way of disabling it. Let's talk about the game itself, The game is really good it has great graphics, and i don't know if the game is veary well optimized because i have a gtx 980 ti and a i7 4790k processor which runs the game a max settings locked at 60fps 1080p. What i can tell you about this game form my play time on the xbox one is that the story is somthing new based on any of the other call of duty's in it's franchise. Black ops three uses this concept of dni which stands for Driect neural interface. You and you team lead by taylor are connected to each other on a whole new level, But because of dni you can use it to controal simulations in your own mind and also to gather intel on your enemies. But having somthing so powerfull can go wrong in so many ways.The reason i got this game like most people was for the zombies and let me tell you they do impress. I did get the digital deluxe addition which came with the season pass and the giant dlc. Shadows of evil is veary fun with loads of easter eggs and including grate characters like the increadible jeff goldblum. and for the Giant which returns are beloved characters Nicholai, Dempsey, taukeiaho, and Edward Richtofen they go into the future form Origins to Der Riese to kill the original Edward Richtofen to chance history for a better future. The zombies game play is fun and also challenging i just wish they still had dolphin diving in the game for zombies only. Sliding in zombies feels like the garbage that was advanced war fare zombies. Thank you treyarch developers for not adding jump bosting to zombies, just keeping it simple is a good thing sometimes.So all you controller users do not buy this game in less you do not have a problem with the game aiming for you!"

Because for every release they make millions of $$$ in profit on the first week of release alone, and they laugh because the sheep just flock to their feet when they announce the next reskin.The last Call of Duty franchise I purchased was Black ops II, after that I gave up, I then seen a $60 price mark on BLack Ops III, I thought why not try it and see the new futuristic outake on video games, as I downloaded 47GB I played Singleplayerand found that it stuttered on every frame, it was as if I had 666 ping. So I gave multiplayer a shot, I found similar results but found poor map designs, the same weapons (SIngularity gun? A 1 shot 1 kill sniper rifle with a differnet skin) and the same gameplay.

I talk from the future where is MSMC and olympia in supply drops, and I want them so bad , but the fact that I will never get them (cuz  I will never spend money) hurts. Treyarch and Activision should ♥♥♥♥ off and better end the COD series or take the good direction, otherwise the entire community will be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Im sick of treyarch adding DLC weapons instead of nerfing the broken guns in this game, such as brecci, po6 or VMP. The only patch change they made was on some DLC guns I dont even own ( even though I opened 200+ supply drops). I ♥♥♥♥ing hate how they encourage the DLC weapons over the other weapons, and that is killing the vibe of the game.  In the past CODS there were no DLC weapons, and back then COD was perfectly balanced, cuz iw,and treyarch did numerous changes on the meta of the game by fixing multiple errors and nerfing or buffing certain guns. in cod bo3, it aint happen. Its been almost a year and no buffs or nerfs were applied to the original guns, but only to DLC guns. And talking about errors: There are so many glitches happening in zombies and multiplayer, more glitches than any of the other CODs. I gotta say, treyarch fixed a lot of them, but theres still more of them, and they take 5 months to fix about 10 bugs, because they are busy with adding DLC guns and applying buffs/nerfs to the old DLC guns.WAKE UP TREYARCH, this isnt the good approach of call of duty. Stop adding DLC guns for a while and take your time to fix most of the game issues and to buff/nerf the original guns ,so you can change the meta and add a new lair of variety to the game. cod BO3 will DIE if u dont do the things I listed earlier. At least cod WWII will be a good game and will make a change. I really loved bo3 in the past, when there were 4 DLC weapons and when u really buffed/nerfed the original guns. hope the hate from the community will make you wake the F** up and cut the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. We dont like DLC weapons and supply drops and The fact that only ppl with hundreeds of dollars can get them. The community has been so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off for almost 6 years now, and we, the simple players that dont buy COD points, are insignificant in your eyes. We have been supporting COD for so long and we are sick of tolerating your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You destroyed COD and we all hate that about yall at Activision, Treyarch and IW. (Except Jason Blundell, cuz zombies is the last good thing about black ops 3). Please stop being so greedy and listen to the COMMUNITY because COD is the only franchise that doesnt give a ♥♥♥♥ about the opinion of the players. First you ADD EXO JUMPS AGAIN,along with a huge amount of viewkick, and you dont even include the TOUGHNESS perk. Second of all, you CONTINUE the beef of advanced warfare with the supply drops. THEN, You add DLC weapons, that are impossible to get unless you pay HUNDREEDS of $ . And what you get from those money? A RESKIN OF THE COMBAT KNIFE?????? WTF TREYARCH. AND LAST, you patch the game from 5 to 5 months and the patches are directed to MICRO DLC AND SUPPLY DROPS? WHAT?if you have listened to your fans ,treyarch, none of this wouldve happened and COD wouldve been a great franchise. youve buried the traditional COD since ghosts, and , with the launch of cod WWII, a change will be made. only SLEDGEHAMMER realized theres a big problem with COD and launched this beautiful COD game: COD WWII.  you dont do♥♥♥♥♥♥treyarch, but instead, your plan is to let Vonderhaar swim in a pool of money, while we regret giving those money to him. ♥♥♥♥ off treyarch you suck♥♥♥♥♥♥and I hope you develop black ops remastered or black ops 4 so you can make it up to us. We dont want ANY supply drops, we want all DLC guns to be free ( If we have season pass), we want BOOTS ON THE GROUND, we want VIETNAM PERIOD, and on top of that, WE DONT WANT TO BE IN THE FUTURE. Please Treyarch read this comment and UNDERSTAND that if you listen to your fanbase, a good change will be made. Nowdays, if I compare COD with the video game history, id say that it started fairly well ( atari), then got improved ( nintendo, SEGA), and then got so ♥♥♥♥ing bad and ppl still play it ( Tiger portable consoles). And now COD will be good again, with introduction of wwII (gameboy portable consoles that killed the Tiger♥♥♥♥♥♥portables).Sorry if this comment is so long, and congrats if you get to read this last note.

I have had very little performance issues, no mouse lag, clipping textures or any such problems. THE 1 problem I have had is the matchmaking system it is broken and 60% of the time end up on overseas servers where the game becomes unplayable due to the difference in pings causing bad lag and in this game that is not on. Hurry up and bring back dedicated servers or this game will go dead like Advanced Warfare surely you developers have realised without dedicated servers the games have no actual lifespan. So resolve this issue and improve the matchmaking or at least include a max ping limiter to avoid ending up on servers overseas. Otherwise 5/5 for me."

Well, it was rather fun BEFORE the first horrendous Black Market update hit, but when it did, it basically gave birth to COD: AW 2... yes, yes, I do realise that the weapons added in the update(s) will not exalt your playing to a new level and make you obliterate every living thing, but it is just the core marketing strategy that I find dead wrong and is a major factor in the dilapidation of a lot of otherwise great games; If I have paid for both the game and the dlc I should definitely have all the guns readily available to me... I should not have to pray to the RNG Jesus in hopes that I get a new gun. When the game is a triple A game with a huge following, the generated revenue will always (well, almost always) be huge - why microtransactions THAT ADD NEW WEAPONS are preposterously out of place. I really could care less if the added microtransactions were purely aesthetic because then they would at least not tamper with the core gameplay of the game.

Neither are solutions.-There are a ton of software ""hacks"" available that go undetected. I have no idea how the developers feel about this, but they don't seem to mind. If you really want to play in this type of environment, expect a few thing:-If you call people out for unrealistic ability you will be deamed a ""complainer"", ""haxcuser"", etc...

I have to disagree, all nessacery items can be gotten legit and if you want to look BA then sure buy cod points, but honestly i dont give a s***. Three: not boots on the ground. Ok I get its not an OG style cod, but do you enjoy playing the game? yes: good stop b****ing and enjoy playing the game. No:then shut up and go play BO2 or MW2, heck maybe even ghosts. Sure this game would've been better received if it had been boots on the ground but i dont care i like paurkor. If I want boots on the gound I go play BO2. So I just disproved some major faults, so now i say why its good. One: zombies is fun, and you get a great starter map. Two: Multiplayer is fast paced, but not so much so that its just chaotic *cough AW cough*. Three: Haven't tried campaign just yet, but i""ve heard it's good and ITS FREAKING MULTIPLAYER. why it took treyarch this long to do this I will never know. Four: nightmares, if you don't know, it's a bonus game-mode that is free that is basically zombie story mode, and its a blast. Five: dead-ops arcade. Its a zombie top down shooter thats fun if you start to rage at MP. Six: speaking of MP contrary to popular belief its actually pretty fun and balanced.

A lowly made horror movie like experience where things suddenly pop up and try to scare you. And ""zombie"" robots, then fake human soilders that suddenly appear on the battleground out of nowhere. And then actual zombies! I'm not a big fan of zombie stuff but if I wanted to kill zombies I'd go play left for dead. Maybe the style suites someone, but I was looking for a military like experience, like those previous releases.This game was so bad I had to go back and play MW to wash off the bad experience."

And then it boots me to the game selection screen and I can immediately reconnect, nothing to do with my internet. Also, you can lose connection offline. What the hell?? offline? it happens alot during zombies and screws me over. Fun to play multiplayer but its mostly grinding, nothing fun like tf2, and zombies have no depth, you upgrade your sword, get the wonderweapon, grind your heart out until the highest level, but CAMPAIGN, they did a great job on, Good story, could've done more on hendricks which is a main character that dissapears in the last mission, but replayability, to get all the service medals and accolades is fun. I rated this with a thumbs down because it is a good game but its mostly grinding and gets on my nerves when I get kicked out or am having a bad time.EDIT : HOPEFULLY, they will do a good job on the DLCs but seeing as they already announced the first one december 8th, they are definetly rushing it out, it will definetly not be good quality, I don't know that for sure. Also nightmares, it isn't a big part of the game, but they did not do a good job, took the same maps, replaced the people with zombies, made your character have a different voice and new cutscenes.

I play the campaign 5% of the time, the multiplayer 25% of the time, and zombies for the remaining 70% of the time. I've never even touched this game's campaign. The multiplayer is pretty much what everyone else is saying about it. It's lousy. Wall jumping and sliding and double jumping. It's no longer the CoD we all know and (sort of) love. It's a failed Titanfall wannabe (and Titanfall is pretty good). All these different classes and special abilities is an interesting touch to the gameplay so I'm indifferent as to how I feel about it overall.Now if we're gonna talk about Zombies, then I would recommend buying the game for that alone. I personally think that Black Ops 3's zombies is the best so far. In depth story, gameplay, new mechanics, wonderful maps, and new wonder weapons. It's probably not $60 worth to play just one zombies map. Then another $6 to play a remastered map. Then another $50 for four more maps. BUT they're all realllllly good. The only thing that sucks is if you want to play with friends, you better have some amazing luck (or a lot of money) for them to want to buy this sad disgrace of Black Ops game.TLDR...Do not recommend for multiplayer or campaign.Mostly recommend for Zombies (when it's on sale)."

Black Ops 3  was a huge suspense waiting for it to come out but once it did, the love hate aspects were immediate. Multiplayer was my go to for everyone (same with basically everyone else lol) but Black Ops 3 multiplayer just isnt there for me. There seems to be a slack for the amount of differents guns compared to all the other games, and the ability to fly and swim personally is just stupid and basically pointless in my eyes as there was no good reason for this impliment of the game. Otherwise the mulitplayer runs perfectly for me and no problems with it at all, but if you're solely buying Black Ops 3, save your money and buy one of the other Call of Duty's. But if you're a zombies man aswell then this review turns the whole other direction. I think along with many others that this zombies is by far the best one that they put out! They finally brought the big maps back compared to Black Ops 2 and the customization for it is phenomenal, and you won't be dissapointed in the zombies at all! After the recent-ish updates to it they also finally fixed the broken lobbies for zombies so thats just a big bonus in of itself. Yet again zombies runs pefectly and no problems what so ever. Campaign is alright compared to the other Call of Duties and in those regards the abilities to jet pack and swim are think are seated perfectly and make complete sense but, I just don't believe they have a place in multiplayer. Otherwise with everything together its a pretty great game and definetly worth the $60 plus the upcoming DLC's look f***ing incredible!!!!"

It's fast , explosive with a bunch of new weapons, perks, abilities, and specialities.. Weather you're a run and gun or a more consertive player there are many things about this game that will fit your style ..The beloved Camapign..Can't talk about start to finish cause ive dedicated most of my time to online but ive logged about the 1st 5-6 missions in coop with some friends and its as explosive as any Hollywood COD to date, If your system is up to the task of runing the graphics above the med/high range you will truly get lost in the visual fidelity which I will give the team a pat on the back..So far its a very action packed blast !!Zombie'sWell what can you say bad about slaughtering the undead and once again my biggest like for Treyarch is the zombies and once again they have delivered, and imo they actually seem to have made this one a tad more challenging.  Pew Pew you Zombie ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ !!!Don't believe the it's infested with hacks crying in the forums...Yes just like every other FPS with online play will come cheaters expecially with another  major title like Call of Duty..  Have I ran into a few in my many matches so far ? Yup and with my answer I will also say that with theater mode it really puts you in control of was this guy for real or BS ??   Ive submitted 100% proof of hackers to the dev team to see within a few days that player being banned.. Lets face it Treyarch does a much better job at filtering this scum out quicker and more efficently than Activision/ IW.. Also keep in mind you have many perk options and abilities to help hear or see the future :)OptimizationOnce again many do cry that this game is just horribly optimized but I really do think most of these cry's are issues on the users end, Now it has been confirmed that running textures on extra which really has no visible improvement over high can cause a vram or system ram leak..Some i5 and i7 users but not all also had a stuttering issue weather the game was maxing the cpu and hyperthreading or just plain high temps causeing system to throttle down seems to have been addressed pretty quick and that seems to be solved for 98% of those that had issues..For me ive had absolutly no isses running this game weather the settings at 1st were med/high now all on high and not a single problem maintaining at the very least 60 fps , But I will add for higher settings its pretty much a must to have a strong GPU with at the very least 3gb of vram imo..8gb or 6gb system ram ?My personal opinion is there seems to be issues with lower speed ram and 2gb of vram ppl.. 8gb of 1600mhz and 3gb vram seem to have less issues but also seems tied to ppl cranking settings above what their rigs can handle..AMD FX 8350 4.7ghzEVGA GTX 760 4gb FTW8gb GSkill Sniper 1600 MhzWin 10 Pro 64"

It has a great story, you can choose your own class and it even has its       own leveling system.Bonus: Fun gamemodes for wasting your time. They are good adittion to cod, but you will forgot about them a a few daysMultiplayer: So here's a guide how to be good at MP: Have lot of luck. This game is soo much unbalanced. I always ♥♥♥♥ing join a losing game that is about to end. Other thing is that the matchmaking system seems to randomly select teamd and many times I end up with 5 ♥♥♥♥ing level 100 to level 500 players on other team. I even get teams where we are 3 vs 5. Normal logic says to me it should be  4 v 4, but no its 3 v 5 and sometimes even 2 v 6. It looks like the matchmaking was made by some 5 year old kids. Other problem is that netcode is really bad and hit detection is terrible lot of times. Another big problem is that you cannot find any other matches then Team Deathmatch, Chaos Moschpit and Domination. Last probelm are supply drops. You need to spend money on them to get ♥♥♥♥ing weapons, how awesome. And they just keep adding more, but never fix the gamebraking bugs.Zombies: Zombies are the only positive thing about this game. They are fun, replayable, challenging and more... But there is one problem, if you want the whole zombies expierience, you will need to pay lot of money. And even worse, the starting map is terrible.So if you want this game for MP, just buy bo2, trust me its better, I had more fun in AW then in this game and we all know it was terrible, but developers atleast supported the game. If you want to buy this game for zombies do it, but it will cost you lot of money, so be prepared."

GK is a bit much IMO tho- wonder weapons are cool (most of the time)- special weapon thingys (basically the gravity spikes, the sword, the skull of sapwe, and crazy dragon thing in GKCONS:i dont like to hate on zombies. i love zombies and want it to be as good as possible every Cod. however, BO3 zombies cannot go free without some criticism.- the insanely tedious setting up routines you need to do. oh my god. *puke* if you buy a new dlc map and expect to just jump in not knowing anything about the map, ha. good luck on getting past round 8 my friend. if you dont look up some stupidly overcomplicated setup guide on youtube before you jump in, you are going nowhere. im not goint to hate on only black ops 3 either, because many other maps are guilty of this as well. this is why many people idolize the giant. I love the giant, but it can get a bit boring at times. so i try to learn the other maps to the best of my ability.- THE FREAKIN EASTER EGGS! ok. if you want any chance of completing any of the EE's besides the giant, you HAVE to look up either a reddit post or a youtube video that shows you every step of the EE. i dont like that. again, im not goint to hate on only black ops 3 either, because many other maps are guilty of this as well.- Gobblegums.ugh.these again.making bad zombies players with large bank accounts easily reach round 100.i wish treyarch had an option you could enable, where you could DISABLE the gobblegums in game. no machines to get them. they also ruin maps too. in the ZC update, EVERY SINGLE MAP was worsened by the gobblegums. i.e origins.in bo2 origins, you have to pay normal zombies. no pay to win BS, no. just you, the map, and your skill at zombies. you had to FIGHT to get to round 100, or to complete the EE. now, it goes like this.spawn inspam gobble gum machineget shopping free, perkaholic, immolation, etc. round onemap is open , you have PaPed guns, and is isroundone.then just youtube a guide on how to get the staffs and whats the EASIEST strat to round 100get to round 100 in an hour.feel no sense of accomplishment whatsoever knowing i had so much aid in doing so.so it is easy in the sense of gobblegums, your overall skill required to survivebut too overcomplicated in the sense of EE's and setting up.so thats about it. really quick ill do the other misc. modes in the game.-FREERUN: fun for like, 20 minutes and then boring af. all of the top scores can never be beaten because treyarch patched g slide glitch, leaving the records set to stay for all of time.-NIGHTMARES: sucks probably-DOA2: not bad, fun to play once every three months.whew, thats all of it.MULTIPLAYER: 5/10ZOMBIES: 7/10its a good game, but not amazing, also not bad."

The campaign is very shot I completed it in 7 hours on veteran difficulty the graphics are not mind blowing they are average for a game released in 2015 if you want a game with the best graphics I would go for Just Cause 3.If you like 14 year olds screaming at you buy this game if you would like hackers buy this game if you buy this excepting amazing graphics do not buy this game. The online is appalling the ping to the online servers are always above 50 even on zombies, there is so many bugs with this game also the game does not fully optimize to use Crossfire or SLI for multiple GPU systems.once the game is a year old I will revist and update my review.I always read CoD is a casual shooter that takes NO skill.It's NOOB friendly.It's THIS ,it's THAT.Well, I think to do well in this game you need skill.Maybe not brain science, but skill indeed.You can't in one breath say CoD takes no skill, and then say look at my 4.75KDR.I've watched countless vids on youtube, and guys like DAH GAME have skill.The skill lies in reaction time, aim, and the 6th sense of knowing what your enemy is going to do before they do it.You can't go 45-3 in TDM w/o skill. I'm not talking about camping for kills.I'm talking about running around the map a DOMINATING.If this game took NO skill, no one would go negative.When that guy on your team goes 5-17, and you say to yourself,wow he sucks,that's because he has NO SKILL.Did Counter Strike take skill, HELL YEAH!More skill than CoD sure,but the guns can't kill for you.In a game where you can't stack KS ,it takes more skill than MW2.The skill also lies in not dying 25 times."

Besides the 1000+ hours I have on PS4 I can`t recommend this game.1.If you like Microtransactions then this is the game for you because there is A LOT and I mean A L O T of them in this game. Almost every single weapon (mostly melee) are used in supply drops that cost cyptokeys which brings me to my second point.2. Grinding- Theres 2 ways to get Cryptokeys. The first is clearly buying them. The second is grinding like no tomorrow. Now yes, you don`t need these weapons, they just look cool, and when you have something cool you know what happens, people start targeting you and take your stuff and use it for there montages (yes they still exist).3. Children- Now when I say children I mean the adults that cant accept the fact they lost and can`t spare the 1 second of typing ""GG"", but they`ll spend about 1-2 minutes calling you a hacker everytime they die to you because you drop shotted them.4- Hackers- You know the drill with EVERY Call of Duty game that exists. After about a week this game came out I was expieriencing hackers on PS4 and my friends were encountering them on PC. Hackers/Modders are becoming better at making them for these games since they all have basically the same coding and format so they can just copy and paste a menu and rename it for like Infinite Warfare or Modern Warfare Remastered.

What you should take from this is that at this time, one 980 can't handle the game at 1080p 60fps.I'm going to spare you the details on plot and gameplay. Gameplay is what you'd expect from cod with a few elements borrowed from Titanfall. The inter mission lobby is a nice addition, as are the freerunning levels. There's definitely plenty of content.

If you don't agree with what I'm saying, please don't reply with a rebuttal as this isMY OPINIONSingle Player CampaignI'll start off with the single player campaign. The first half of it was mostly boring with forgettable levels and story. These levels were somewhat emersive but I could tell that they were rushed mainly because when the level became boring, the game would put in what felt a forced COD cliche like a helicopter crash or a slowmotion break-in into the room with either a hostage or an enemy boss inside. Back in the day, these were really cool concepts, but now, we are looking for a new concept other then an up your sleeve COD stereotypical game element. These cliche's didn't fit into the gameplay that well as I was left confused or irritated by these. The second half was actually pretty emersive for the most part with levels that seemed pretty well designed and executed. The cliche's in this half, unlike the first half, fitted in well with the game and added to the experience. The characters were excellent as their intentions and actions were clear and understandable. One of the main enemy bosses in this half was an Asian women. I was so excited at this point where I could break in and have a nice boss fight. But no, once you break into her room, she fights you in a cutscene, then you put her head in the fire where she dies. This left me disappointed as the game hyped up this moment so much but failed to deliver. When you are in the dream world at the end of the game, you go through a lot of sequences until you get to the end and save the day. When you feel like you've just saved the world, you black out. I found out that nothing in the game was real except the start and it was all just a dream and the ending is you dying from your injuries from the start of the game. This made the single player campaign go from average all the way to down right disappointing.The MultiplayerNow for the Multiplayer. The multiplayer was fundimentally the same as your standard annual Call of Duty game. There was nothing really new that I'm aware of except for some new guns, abilities and a whole different theme. As usual it became very addictive for a while.VerdictOverall, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 was an disappointing game. It was fun, but it was lacking the well orchestrated design that made the Modern Warfare trilogy so popular and loved.I'm gonna give this: 4/10 (Below Average)"

Even then the game is inferior to black ops 2 in almost every way i can think of.First, the singleplayer, it was just ♥♥♥♥ing boring, and the characters were absolutely terrible, i know their is supposed to be a hidden story thats worked into the narritive, but i dont really give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the world or characters because of how lazy it is presented. Skip the campaign if you enjoy cod storylines.Second, the multiplayer, its almost exactly the same as advanced warfare, except they have altered the boost jumps now, so it is more balanced than before, its fun, but in incredibly short bursts, the amount of times is got frustrated was insane, and this has never happened with any of the other cod games multiplayers (i have not played ghosts or aw)Third, the zombies mode, well aside from having awful characters and only ONE map to play in, zombies is still pretty fun to play, its a shame that all of the other maps have to be bought through dlc. My advice is play it with a mate in co-op because then it is quite fun.Fouth, the pc port, it is one of the most unoptimized games i think ive ever seen, my friend has the ps4 version, which ive played, and it looks better than the pc?? In 2015/16 this♥♥♥♥♥♥is not ♥♥♥♥ing acceptable and i feel ashamed that i didnt at the very ♥♥♥♥ing least buy this game on ps4, if you are going to buy it i recommend picking it up for that.The verdict: Black ops 3 is fun, but in short ♥♥♥♥ing bursts, it lacks the story storytelling arc of the first two games, and also lacks the multiplayer balance, maybe im just ♥♥♥♥ing tired of cod, but its obvious that it is slowly dying year after year after year, and unless infinite warfare completely changes the damage done by ghosts, advanced warfare and this, i doubt that cod will ever return to the glory days it once had."

In the past (and I'm talking when CS:S source came out) the person with the fastest internet would always win trades or would always get a minor edge. This is not the case anymore, I warn any one with internet above speeds of 30Mbps to avoid this game at all costs. I have internet speeds that reach 110Mbps down and 20Mbps up, because of this I am constantly being ""1 shot."" Meaning I'll turn a corner, see a enemy and raise my gun. I'll get off 2-3 hit markers but lose in the trade. On the kill cam the person is already ADS and firing at me before I even pick my gun up. There are many people in this world who still don't have fast internet or a good computer, because of this Trearch decides to insert crap lag compensation into the game and makes the gameplay unfun for any player who has a good computer/internet. This game is AMAZING if you have a bad computer/very slow internet, on top of that I keep getting into matches with high ping players, I'm talking 200 +. The matchmaking is TERRIBLE.To add insult to injury you can't even run the game on low settings. You have to scale the game down to 90% or less (meaning scaling the resolution of your monitor down). This makes the game look like crap, on top of not being able to tell a person from an object at times. Another reason to avoid this game is the controller aim assist exploit. I see people tracking me like you would on a console, meaning someone is using aim assist with a controller WHILE using their mouse/keyboard. There is also videos showing the insane amount of lag between shooting 1 player and the player receiving a hit. This ranges from 100ms to 250ms + in the SAME MATCH. The game is just coded poorily and doesn't allow people with good internet to prevail. AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS!!!!I give this game a 1/10, the devs made new maps, new classes/abilities and copy pasta'd 80% of the game but changed no mechanics, didn't even attempt to tackle lag comp for PC nor do they even care. Out of all the many game modes they have only 4 are played. Core - Team Deathmatch, Core - Domination, Hardcore - Team Deathmatch and Special - Chaos Moshpit. This game could have been what COD4 (Original Modern Warefare) was....a great game. I see this game dying in the next few weeks due to Battlefront and at this point I'm debating buying it and playing it over this game. At least in that game I have a small chance to return fire and KILL the person."

After some quick troubleshooting, turns out I had to disable a shield on my antivirus for the game to even launch... and it's sad that Treyarch haven't attempted to patch their game to stop this issue from occuring.The second thing is the lack of a solid playerbase, especially in Zombies (I am a big fan of Zombies). I thought that surely I'd be able to find a match with no worries, seeing as the new DLC came out, however, seeing as I live in Australia, I was very hard pressed being put into a match with good connectivity; most of the time I'd be put into a match with 200+ ping - practically unplayable.The third thing, and the one that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off the most, was the dropouts, and the 'always online' requirement.When I was on multiplayer Zombies, if the host was bad, the entire game would end and everyone would be kicked back to the lobby. Kind of a shame that even after all these years that there are no dedicated servers, which would prevent this issue from occuring.On the topic of being kicked out of the game, even if I play singleplayer Zombies and my connection dropped out, I would be kicked out and sent back to the lobby. That's right, even if I playSINGLEPLAYER.I couldn't imagine getting to round 40 or something, only to be kicked out because my internet dropped out. It's a real dog move from Treyarch to include that requirement.Those reasons alone were enough for me to decide to refund the game and the DLC, without even going into the gameplay.Seriously, if you're going to make a game, at the very least make it so that merely launching the game isn't like trying to jumpstart a Ford, and running it without experiencing a dropout of sorts ins't like doing tightrope on a razor's edge.TL;DR- If you insist on getting this game, do not be surprised if the game runs worse than Lance Armstrong without drugs."

Theres a difference in trying to keep a game franchise alive and just trying to revive a dead friend. Now bring out a game that is fully around Zombies (The only real reason why people still give any cares about this anymore) than we have a great game and a franchise that will be BOOMING. Untill that day happens I can not and will not recommend Call of Duty to anyone ever again. It's a sad day, one that I was hoping I would never have to have, but someone has to say it and thats just how it is."

These problems include the likes of the random frame dips.  These dips I have mainly seen currently in the campaign.  I personally have not witnessed any random drops in multiplayer as of yet.  However a friend of mine who has a similar set up has.  I believe the only difference is he has installed it on an older HDD where I have it on my >1 year - 1 year SSD.Anyway back to the game, if you liked Black Ops II, there is no doubt in my mind you will enjoy this (If you personally have little to no issues similar to my experiences that is) This is the first COD I have enjoyed since BO2 as well, to add, it is also one that does not infuriate me with every kill.  Though the spawns still need to be fixed (Looking mainly at Nuketown) it is definitely Black Ops 2 with a next gen feel.Personally, if you want to try the game go ahead and try it.  Every system seems to play it differently.  Just make sure to watch your hours played and try to keep it under 2 just in case.  Hopefully within time Tryarch can patch the game and lower the amount of frame rate hiccups.Current System:i7-4790KMSI GTX 970 4G Gaming Edition (2 in SLI) (Sli did not seem to make any difference from my testing)16GB Ripjaws Triton X @ 2400MHZAsus Maximus VII HeroRosewill Capstone 750w 80+ GoldP.S.

What I didn't expect was that the only people who still play this game are people who ONLY play this game. I went from 1.5kdr average on my friends xbox to a 0.33 kdr on here. But I'm not a sore loser. I'm really not. I thought I'll just keep playing and get better. Then I started to notice the fact that there is no community for this game. There's usually only one lobby open and it's for basic team deathmatch. Barely anyone plays other game modes. No Gun Game, No Hardcore, No Search and Destroy. And It was even double exp weekend. If this is what the game is like on event weekends forget it. I'll only use this game for zombies.TL;DR: Only buy this game for zombies."

Allow me to now post some of the pros and cons.PROS~-Zombies is alright, some maps have a few ideas that are a little.. well.. unconventional, let's say.-Hey Dead Ops is back, neato.-Graphics don't hurt-Free-Run mode can be fun if your into that sort of thing (I'm not)CONS~-You play as Cyborg from Teen Titans-BOO-YAH-Multiplayer is mainly consistant of the entire server sliding around the map with a knife and sniper-You fight against Cyberdine rip offs in the campaign-Campaign is pretty stale-The Nightmare mode seems alluring at first until you actually see it. I lost my drive to attempt after I saw that when you do it co-op and somebody gets down, rather than holding a gun they have a HUGE SILVER SHINY RECTANGLE in their hands.-You are the highly experimental Terminator made exclusively out of Aluminum Foil-Parkour is EXTREMELY forced on you through the multiplayer maps being essential to be able to effectively move around the map. I get it, you want to push the feature but come on, when did call of duty's calling card become muscly robot men sliding and flying all over the place.-Melee no longer swings a knife in multiplayer and campaign. Instead you now have to EQUIP A KNIFE as a secondary weapon. You still get your knife in zombies though, which is cool.-The Guns are basically all just reskins and renames, as usual. Honestly I don't expect any less from CoDOver all I would give this game a 5/10 and I would only suggest this to die hard fans of call of duty or if you just want the zombies. My harsh judgement could also be due to the fact that I kind of suck at multiplayer comparatively. But hey, that's my two cents."

Sure, it looks pretty and you can run along walls now but it does seem that we're playing the same game from 2007 which, lets face it did rather blow us all away with a new level of FPS. The fact I'm writing this at half six in the morning after having just been booted from my solo game because their servers went down doesn't have any bearing.

End of story.This review is based entirely around  the creator's choice to put DLC weapons in crates. Seems like not much to review on, but this single action ruins multiplayer for me.Let me take you back to the days of Ghosts, when dlc weapons like the Ripper came out. People wanted it, and it was a very good gun. It may or may not have been broken, but it didn't matter too much. You payed four bucks, and got the gun. That was that. No tricks, no chance, no nothing. Just enjoy your new toy. Back then people had no complaints about spending $10, $20, hell even $60 for dlc. They would buy dlc guns all the time. Even if they didn't use them, they at least wanted to give them a try.But apparently, it's not enough money for these worthless companies.Fast forward to today and now they're in crates. The chance of getting them is slim to none and if you do, you usually get the crappy ones like the FFAR or the MX Garand. Want to get the other weapons? Well your best chance is to either play 500,000 hours of call of duty to earn in game currency and hope to god that this next crate is the one to give you a goodie, or you can deepthroat the company's tic tac sized genitalia and throw your entire paycheck at them. and even then, you may not get any weapons.So let me ask you. What was so bad about just offering the weapons as dlc for one standalone price and that was it?The answer is obvious. The company wanted more money. And it shows in their revenue. People are STILL paying their entire wallet just to try and get that one dlc weapon they really want. They're begging the company to give them the weapon, and they won't stop paying the company until they get the weapon.This wouldn't be so bad if they were all balanced weapons. But oh I'm sorry. They're broken as hell. Don't believe me? AK 74u. Marshall 12. 1911. DIY renovator. Olympia. Shadowclaw, and the list goes on and on. All of these guns are monsters, and they're all hiding in crates. This concept is absolutely unacceptable. It makes the game entirely pay-to-win unless you wanna spend 500,000+ hours trying to find every gun for free.No more. This is the straw that broke the camel's back. In attempting to open the customer's wallet even further, they have closed mine for good. To hell with this company, and to hell with Call of Duty."

The guns given doesn't have too much variety but this is made up for with the camo's attachment's and perks. Treyarch have really though this game through and they have done a good job of it. Each patch they release is 1 step closer to an amazing game. Sure , It's already amazing but the bug's have had their downside's and the people that don't have it and talk about the bad review's saying ""it's a crap game and that AW was better"" don't know what they are missing. the bug's that were once bug's are now patched and this is why I like Treyarch , They have listened to the community and have really worked with they to produce an amazing game.I recommend this game to anyone who like's the cod franchise.I can run this game at 60 fps maxed out with no problem's.

I did not pre-order this game as i was hesitant from previous COD. The last COD I consistently played was Black Ops 1. I was fairly happy with the game as the zombies were satifying. But now to the point, what i think. Early in the release I would have some serious FPS drops. This problem has been fixed as of now and that was really the only problem I have experienced besides small connection issues every now and then. I haven't really played the campaign much so i dont have an opinion on that. Now, for the multiplayer. Multiplayer has been the center of COD games for me, as i usually never touch the campaign. When i first got on Multiplayer, it had a HUGE learning curve as i had never played an FPS on PC, this was expected. The weapons in the game at first seemed fine as everybody was a reasonably low level (As of 11/9/15). I am now a first prestige level 21 and I have come to realize that some guns are in my opinion, are out of control. Guns I am mentioning are the; Haymaker, Gorgon and Drakon. If I had to put them in order from the most OP;1: Drakon2/3: Gorgon/HaymakerNow don't get me wrong, I'm not the best but walking around a corner and getting blown away within about 2 feet of walking around seems a little ridiculous. Now camping with the Drakon doesen't help the cause but it's little to no recoil with rapid ROF is unbeatable. I would like to see some changes made to this but treyarch can do what they want, my K/D will just keep dropping to the DrakonI did not play AW but from the things i have heard, it didn't seem very enjoyable. Coming from BO1, In around Vietnam, switching to 2063 was a leap to say the least. In my opinion, the wall running and jumping is balanced perfectly as it takes time for your jets to recharge. The speed of the Multiplayer gameplay seems just right, not to slow, yet not too fast.Now Zombies, it's mediocre, I am not a fan of having to do all the things just to PAP but I'm a traditional Zombies player.Zombies: 8/10Multiplayer: 9.1/10Campaign: N/AThanks for reading, I would like to hear your opinion also.Add me if you want to play sometime, Zombies MP, anything!"

Multiplayer had its moments during the game's life cycle. A lot of customization in campaign, multiplayer and zombies, but the problem with this game isn't the features it has, or the setting or whatever other people make up as a reason for a bad review. It's mainly that this game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pc port, lazy and absolutely broken to the point that it is not one bit enjoyable at times. If you play it for Zombies, be warned, the game's engine crashes randomly on the map ""Origins"", a Black Ops 2 fan's favorite.

So if you are looking for a review of the multi-player aspect of this game, you should look elsewhere.  I haven't tried it and have no plans to try it.OK, if you are still with me, then I'm guessing you are interested in how this game plays in campaign/single-player mode...StorylineIMO, what makes a good/entertaining campaign is the storyline.  As an example, when I played MGSV I liked it, but the storyline was, at least to me, too sparse or just lacked the cohesiveness I was looking for, especially with all the side missions.IMO, the storyline in Call of Duty: Black Ops III (BOIII) is better than average, but could be better.  Personally, I would like it if it were also more in depth.  I'm a ""stealth"" (sniper) style player and found the storyline to be good, but not great.  To play it all the way through, with all side missions and not rushing took me about 45 hours.  And about 30 hours the second time.I'd rate the storyline at:  8 starsGameplaySpeaking of gameplay, I found it dynamic when needed, but I was also able to slow things down and snipe when I wanted to.  The gameplay on the ""normal"" setting had a fairly good balance between story and difficulty.I found the game engaging enough to play it through twice.  I would like a couple more difficulty settings between ""normal"" and ""full bore"" because I'm not a good enough gamer to handle the highest level.I'd rate the gameplay at:  7 starsGraphicsI have a ASUS 780 TI graphics card.  I found that the graphics in BOIII was up to the standard I expect.  IMO, it is a visual masterpiece.  Definitely worth the price.I'd rate the graphics at:  9+ starsSummaryOverall, I'd recommend it at 1/2 price, but would question a purchase at full price, especially in Sept 2016.  Personally, I think that way too many games emphasize the multi-player aspect and, because of that, campaign suffers.Not bad for $60, but I'd like to see about double the story for full price (as of today (Sept 1, 2016) the game is available for 1/2 price), which would make this, IMO, a great deal for the gameplay you get.Overall I'd rate this game at:  8 starsScottPS.  I did try the Zombies and found it lacking.  I really enjoyed games like the Metro 2033 pair, but the gameplay in this was not up to the normal COD level.  I definitely would not purchase this game for the Zombies.  Frankly, I wish they'd taken the effort they put into the Zombies mode and put it into making the campaign mode better.I'd rate the Zombies at: 4 starsPPS. The game ratings are based on a 1-10 stars scale."

,Not Recommended,311210,33366454,Posted: 8 July,all,That Guy ☆VG☆,"Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 is a FPS from the CoD franchise. I've been playing Call of Duty since World at War, I considered myself done with the franchise anyway after the games began to lost their spark, but I thought after seeing some twitch streams I might give this game a try, since I at least enjoyed Advanced Warfare 2 and their campaigns.Campaign: Maybe it's because I'm getting older, but by god this was the worst story I've played so far. Black Ops 1 and 2 had a story that tied together classical war game-play with sci-fi elements in a subtle way that always made the big campaigns plot twist a surprise. This time, the ending is almost blatantly laid out in front of you from the moment you beat the third mission, assuming you're paying attention. Even getting to the third mission was like pulling teeth, I wasn't engaged by the gameplay, I wasn't interested in any of the characters. I'm not sure what the message they're trying to get across in this game is, but it's a wholy unsatisfying experience, and by the 6th mission I was turning the difficulty down to recruit just so I could slog through the boring levels and make it to the end.You're not fighting a war, because it's never really explained who you're fighting for, the game is one big game of ""Chase Paul Taylor around the world"" and by World I mean Singapore and Egypt. Level diversity isn't present here, and level design, while obviously catered to the ""new"" movement mechanics, isn't fleshed out further than the occasional few balconies in a room to add faux verticality. The campaign crutches on the movement mechanics as its interesting gimmick to keep it fresh, but it doesn't really work as well as things such as vehicular combat in the previous games, no matter how linear. The weird robot superpowers you get are all somewhat useless too, as they're just ""Point at person, make them stop shooting you for a bit of time"" Which seems a bit useless when you can just shoot them instead, or use the only decent ability to release killer flaming bees to clear a room. The Campaign is needlessly padded with customization to add this illusion of content in your little lobby/hud, when it's easier to just use the preset load-outs for each level.A boring experience with no payoff, bland characters and far too linear shooting. Playing this made me want to play Black Ops 1. The main problem I find with these overly futuristic installments is that they're not believable enough to immerse yourself in, and atmosphere is completely non-existent. I hope they finally ditch this future BS, it's been 4 years. Take me back to World War 2 already.Zombies: Basically the only reason to play this game, they jam packed all their voice actors and animators to priority #1 on this section of the game. It's has better content and story than the campaign does, it's a little ridiculous. If you're a fan of the zombie mode of the previous CoD games, you'll definitely love this version.Multiplayer: And I thought League of Legends had mobility creep, yet here we are. There are now about 1000 new ways to avoid getting shot, which is actually pretty nice, because it adds far more depth to the dueling aspect of meeting someone in the middle of an open area. Sliding, Jumping, Wall-running all add to a rather refreshing way to play the game. At the same time, it's a little overdoing it, as I somewhat prefer less mobility, but if that's the case I would just switch to a different CoD.In terms of balance, it feels like they've gone for the MW2 approach, whereby ""If everything is disgustingly OP, then nothing is!"" which isn't actually a bad thing. SMG's are still far too powerful, sniper rifles will always be the bane of my existence, and for once the shotguns aren't garbage. Melee has been replaced with weapon butting which is no longer an instant kill, which I feel makes sense with all the new ways to fly at your opponent at light speed. However, you can still equip a knife as a secondary which kills instantly, leading to a lot of knife only players. Maps are well designed around movement, but other than that they're pretty weak. None of them are fun or satisfying to play, and the classic spawn flipping is still as frustrating as ever. All the maps are medium sized, and there's no real diversity like back in MW2 where you had huge maps and tiny ones. Nothing is unique, it's all grey again and devoid of color, which sorely disappointed me.However, as usual Multiplayer is overflowing with content, and it's easy to justify the price tag on this game when you see what games like Battlefront gets away with charging £40 for. There's loads to unlock, accomplish and use. Every game you get like 5 new shiny rewards to skinner box you into playing more, yet there's still no real reason to prestige. This amount of content makes the game feel ""worth it"" in the same way a £50 box of 50 sweets is worth it, but you'll get bored of the same sweet eventually.Pros:+ Zombie Mode is better than ever+ New movement mechanicsCons:- Boring Campaign, bland and un-engaging- Repetitive Multiplayer, per usualTL;DR:4/10If you've never liked Call of Duty, this game won't do anything to change that. Couple the complete lack of innovation in this installment with the abysmally small PC player base and uninspired themes I feel like this is one of the weakest Call of Duty games ever. In its current state, I find it hard to recommend as what you get is a lot of content, but it's all frustrating and ultimately worthless. The running joke has always been that ""Call of Duty is always the same"" but this is no more obvious than in this installment."

Howerver, I haven't played since the first DLC was released. I will break this down into two sections, gameplay issues, and microtransaction issues.GAMEPLAY ISSUES:Matchmaking is an absolute joke, there isn't a server browser, Helen Keller wrote the hit-detection code, the maps are meh, and to top it off there isn't the player base on PC to support their automatic hosting nonsense.There are dedicated servers, but these servers are literally the bare minimum hardware and routinely take giant ♥♥♥♥♥.----------MICROTRANSACTION ISSUES:Activision is taking a page out of CSGO's playbook and have gone full retard with microtransactions. The best part is they eased into it. It's brilliant when you think about it because people never would have bought the game if they knew the supply drops would go this route.So what did they do exactly? First off, there was no pay to get COD points to open supply drops, you got ingame currency that allowed you to do so. Then the first DLC drops and we suddenly have reskinned weapons and filler taunts and jestures in the supply drops. At this time they introduced ""COD points"" which you can spend an asinine amount of money on to open supply drops quicker.The problem is that the math was done on reddit and it was found that you have an incredibly miniscule chance of getting a weapon out of a supply drop.So anyways, the second DLC drops and they've goofed so hard with the new round of micro transactions I am pretty much forced to write this review and warn people to stay away from this game.As of today there is now a ""special"" supply drop that you can only open by spending 300 paid COD points, about $3.00, that will give you a taunt and gesture every time. Whooptie ♥♥♥♥ing doodly-doo.CONCLUSION:So you may be saying ""just don't buy the COD points"", that's not the point. You shouldn't buy this game because of the principle and president these extortion-esqe business practices set for future titles.You vote with your money, and in my opinion you're better off not subjecting yourself to this joke of a title."

But the problem is optimization (not that surprising for some). expected to get a solid 60FPS with medium-high settings, but instead I was greeted with occasional frame drops. Everytime something slightly heavy happens, I instantly get around 20FPS. The sudden frame drops is the only thing that bothers me, and unfortunately, it ruins the whole experience. I'm sure I'd praise the gameplay even more if only it would work correctly.""Mixed"" is what this game deserves on PC. Buy at your own risk.edit: specs (i5-4670, GTX 760 2GB)"

Graphics are nice. Some preformance drops on certian maps but mostly I get constant 60fps. Running the game at High-Medium settings (no AA) on a GTX 850m 4GB ddr3 and I'm pretty impressed. I've had a few crashes but mostly they are not the game's fault but my GPU for being unstable from OC.UPDATE 1 Year LaterI got a beastly gaming PC now. I can run this game at glorius 1440p maxed out at 144hz. There are still some issues with certian maps however the preformance dips are not as bad as before. The game does use a hellish amount of VRAM (6-7GB @ 1440p Extra Quality) but I believe it varies depending on the GPU manufacture and their memory compression. There has been plenty of patches over the year that has made the game more playable including custom maps (which are really great for zombies with friends). I still rate this game quite positivly however it would have been nicer if there were more players. Overall: 8.5/10

Treyarch next time finish the game before you sell it please.The Campaign: Now this is Black Ops 3's weakest point, the campain lacks a story like 80% of the time i dont know what im doing or why im doing it, the character's are really really boring and i dont feel a connection to any of them i dont even remember there names as they have no real connection to the story. Honestly worst Call of Duty Campaign Ever.The Multiplayer: This is my favourite thing in anygame like i have 700+ hours on csgo and i dont think this is any different i am currently really really enjoying mutliplayer it is rather fair as the jumping and wall running arent to OP yet. Sometimes matchmaking can be REALLY broken witb me getting put into games with no people its just me on the map. alone with no one else and this game has really really bad Latency issues right now and if they were fixed with the fps this game would be a perfect 10 for me but right now not really.The Zombies: Extremely fun love the guns and the new gobble gum i dont really like the map but map packs can fix all that ;) but there is one thing unacceptable with zombies right now MATCHMAKING IS SO BROKEN honestly it just doesnt work for me and alot of people. Overall it good but could be better.The Overall: Overall Call Of Duty Blacks Ops III is a fantastic game that is enjoyable for hours. Once everything is fixed this game will probably be one of the best Call of duty's ever. My opinion is if you have the money buy it but if you dont and you wanna save up for it just wait as this game has a few optimisation issues and some people cant even play the game.The Verdict: 8.5/10"

The team balancing is practically non-existent. I get matched up and parterned up with some of the worst players that it has been my displeasure and misfortune to ever encounter. These include toxic individuals who should not be allowed internet privilages since they lack the basic understanding of common curteosy. This umbrella term also refers to the sweaty, try-harding nerds camping in corners the entire game and fane that they are somehow superior to me.This issue leads into the next argument which are case drops. I understand that from a company's perspective this method can be in the right circumstances be very lucrative. That being said, the way it has been implemented is shotty at best. For instance, one of the less recent additions to the game, the DIY 11 Renovator, is unbalanced to the point that a guy is able to go on a 25 - 0 kill streak and win a deathmatch gamemode for his team.But both the issues listed above could be forgiven if the game was actually playable. I haven't been able to get consistent frame rates since I first bought this game a year ago. I have large lag spikes and this occurs even with textures set to low and the miscellaneous particles disabled.All in all, I wish I never bought this game in the first place.=================================================================Update: 1/12/2017=================================================================I have found a solution to my frame rate issue.Black Ops 3, at least for me, continues to run with its priority on low which constricts the fps considerably. This causes large, game-breaking lag spikes.Luckily, -El_Greeko- (Storm_Worm5364 on reddit) created a handy little application to set the running priority of BO3 to high every few seconds.Here is a link to the reddit post:https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops3/comments/3s3xi1/pc_black_ops_3_lagstutter_fix/Even though I have found a solution to the frame rate issue, I really shouldn't have to depend on third-party solutions.My PC has a Skylake i5 core processor with 16 GB of DDR4 memory and Nvidia GTX 960 SSC w/4GB of VRam installed on a MSI Gaming 5 motherboard. The CPU is watercooled with a Corsair cooling unit. I'd say this is a fairly future-proof build.Fairly good specs, but still a lack luster performance stability-wise."

I'm running a humble Intel i7 960 @3.2GHz and an NVidia GeForce GTX550 Ti with 6GB of RAM, some ancient 6 year old♥♥♥♥♥♥ I know. But it can chug through Fallout 4 on Medium with little to no stuttering.So with that said, taking 45 seconds in every round to load up the textures of the map, getting graphical errors where my red dot vanishes leaving a slightly-reddened rectangle where I'm trying to aim feels almost unacceptable. Not to mention that despite VAC bans there seems to be a good handful of cheaters floating about, with no response from Treyarch about either of these glaring issues. The thing leaks memory and can eat up ALL of my internal memory, some people saying it can swallow as much as 7GB uninhibited to just run itself.With all the connection issues, the poor optimisation, the lousy feeling of a weekend mash-up console-port, the rampant cheating, the toxic community and the fact that little has changed to shake up the Call of the Dootle franchise, the cons really out-weigh the pros on this one. Disappointing to say the least considering how much I enjoyed Blops 2 and how much money I dumped in to this heap. Sae your money if you're on the fence about this one."

Campaign is decent as it now allows 4 player co-op, the story itself is ok but not the best one I have seen. The multiplayer is in my opinion one of the best ever because of the specialists and the customisation that you are given. Then finally there is zombies, I don't have to say anything about this because it's still amazing and the most fun and least boring mode there has been in any COD.If you don't like the futuristic setting and the different mobility system, then I would just recommend getting Battlefield as it's the most modern and realistic shooter to this date.If your salty about the game then go play MW2 because we all know that that has the most balanced multiplayer of all of the COD gamesP.S I was not given any money to write this reviewApproved by William"

I was never a multiplayer person however Bo3 has me hooked with multiplayer, thanks to it's amazing guns. Every gun feels rather unique, however each and every one has it's own level of mastery, making it just as good as any other gun. I can't say much about multiplayer, since 85% of my hours in this game go to zombies. However as for zombies, I'm very pleased with how it's going so far. At the time of writing this, Zetsubou No Shima (Or as I like to call it, Zestubou No Shima) hasn't come out, so I can only speak for the three first maps. But I feel really comfortable with each map, and each map has me coming back every time, to see if I can finally reach above round 100 without my pc crashing so I can finally go up on the leaderboards (I have a bad pc and most of the time I crash, I'd like to say 70% of the time I play zombies I crash). However even with all of the crashing, I play day after day, because of how enjoyable it is. It has a very balanced ""meta"", considering you can use any which weapon and make it effective, aside from the XM-53, which can't be double packed. Every map has a good training/camping area, yes even SoE, but I don't use them because of the Margwa. I feel like the CURRENT Liquid Divinium/Cryptokey system is very balanced, allowing a player to grind things out without the use of their wallets.Overall this game has been made really well, and dare I say I have been enjoying this more than any other installment I have played (Those being any CoD game that has treyarch zombies in it). It feels Treyarch has finally found the balance with their guns, which was a major issue in previous installents (There were always a few guns that were better than others) and I just can't really find any complaints about this game.

,Recommended,311210,24349389,"Posted: 16 July, 2016",all,SaibaX <Earth Dimension C-137>,"Ok, so let me start by saying that I don't normally write reviews for COD because, let's face it, we all know what we are buying by now.Black Ops 3 is a bit different from the previous titles. Some may debate on this but this is likely the best ""Recent"" COD from the past 4-5 years.CAMPAIGNThe campaign is decently written though it seems to deviate from the original 2 games. Though it is based in the same universe, Black Ops 2 was the last part of Woods' and Mason's story. I personally enjoyed the story as it added a lot more psychological elements to mess with the player's view on the events taking place. Like the past 2 Black Ops games, this one also does a good job of blurring the line between good and evil. I won't be giving any spoilers so don't worry.The reintroduction on co-op was very pleasant. I actually played with a friend from beginning to the mission Life. The playthrough was all on the new Realistic difficulty. It was challenging but there was a major hiccup once we got to the mission, Life. It seems there are a great many people who ran into a major issue on this mission while playing co-op. There is a section in which you encounter hundreds of robnots constantly respawning all around the map. This also includes heavy armor units and mechs along with flying drones and a single respawning wraith jet. The checkpoint past this section requires all players to reach it in order to activate it however doing so is beyond extremely difficult as one player going down means a mission failure. I wound up having to complete this mission solo in order to complete it.Now then... Between each mission you get to visit a safehouse. From here, you can customize your soldier's appearence, weapon loadouts and cybercore loadout. Cyber cores are basically an assortment of abilities grouped into 3 seperate specialties (Martial, Control and Chaos). You can also find the Training Simulator here. The training simulator allows you to practice using your abilities and weapons with no restriction and grades your performance based on accumulated score (This is also a good way to farm for multiplayer skins as there are 4 skins to earn per weapon though it is the slowest way to do so).Overall the campaign was very enjoyable and I'd give it a 7/10. It could have been better but it certainly isn't bad and is definately fun.MULTIPLAYERBelow is a list of things I think make this a much better entry to the franchise compared to the past 4-5 entries.1.) The developers are constantly working on fixes and adding new things to the game.(What I mean here is, recently they have added new game modes on top of the current ones. The most recent, released within a week of this review is called Fracture. This mode is essentially a mix between Hardpoint (King of the Hill) and Kill Confirmed. It's a very fun mode, if you haven't tried it you should.)2.) They added a new Black Market feature called Contracts.(This is basicly daily and weekly missions to earn bonus Cryptokeys. Cryptokeys being the currency used to open both Common and Rare Supply Drops. These drops contain 3 random items ranging from reticles for sights, weapon skins, specialist skins, weapon attachment skins, new weapons, emotes, dances, images for the emblem creator, textures for the emblem creator, premade emblems and calling cards.)3.) The combat and general gameplay is pretty heavily based on Destiny.(This is a bonus for me because I enjoy the game a lot. Basically, the movement is very similar (except for the wallrunning) as the boost jumping feels the same. They took the subclass system in Destiny and applied the exact same mechanic to the Specialists. There are 9 Specialists and each one has 2 Specialist abilities making 18 ""Supers"".)Now the only complaints I have about this game are as follows:1.) DLC maps are in their own playlists.(Instead of adding DLC maps to the base playlist like other COD games with the ability to disable individual DLCs, they segregated those DLC maps into their own playlist sections. This is very aggrevating as a lot of us enjoy these maps but it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to find matches for these playlists when there are so few people playing in these DLC only playlists.)2.) The lack of people playing other gamemodes makes the game feel very limited.(In other games like Black Ops 2 there were and still are people playing other gamemodes like Hardpoint and Gungame. This isn't really something the devs can fix but they can certainly add more incentive to playing these modes other than adding Cryptokey bonuses and XP bonuses.)ZOMBIESI can't review this too much as my focus has been more on the multiplayer and campaign.I have only played a little bit of this but it was fun every game, it feels exactly like you would expect a COD zombies game to feel. However there are some differences that, IMO, improve the experience drastically.1.) You can now customize your Mystery Box drops.(As you level up in Zombies you will gain access to more weapons to customize. These customizations include skins and attachments. These customizations will appear on the weapon the next time you get lucky enough to find it in a Mystery Box allowing you to customize your Zmobie killing experience.)2.) Gumball machines give you ""mini-perks"".(This new version of Zombies adds Gobblegum. These gumballs give you a fighting edge, but nothing quite as serious as perk-a-cola. I won't go into full detail as there are too many variants of this gum to explain. You can earn new types of gobblegum by visiting Dr. Monty's Factory and spending vials of Liquid Divinium or by leveling up.)Unfortunately this is about all I can really say about Zombies though at some point I may try to play it some more, right now I'm pretty busy trying to unlock Dark Matter in multiplayer though.Now this review may get some hate since I compared Destiny to Black Ops 3 but the similarities are there and cannot be denied when you put the 2 next to eachother and compare them.COD4 will always be my favorite but this game comes out at a 8/10 for me in comparison with the past few games released."

,Not Recommended,311210,24828764,"Posted: 11 August, 2016",all,Kumodatsu,"Not worth it for the campaign or multiplayer in my opinion, and it only comes with one zombie map unless you get the DLC packs, which aren't exactly cheap.The movement mechanics are questionable at best: jumping, climbing and using thrusters use the same key bind so it's hard to control which one to do, causing things like your character putting their weapon away to climb some object instead of simply jumping over it and still being able to fire, leaving you vulnerable to enemies. Pressing the slide button sometimes causes you to crouch instead, which again can be fatal. Wall running will be triggered automatically when jumping at a wall, making it near impossible to jump near a wall without initating a wall run.The majority of my time playing this game has been the zombie mode, which is still as fun as it was in previous games in my opinion, however the game only comes with one map, with other maps being included in the DLCs. If you plan on getting this game for zombies, ask yourself if that's worth your money first. Luckily, thrusters and wall running are absent from zombies (save for one specific location on Shadows of Evil).The campaign is one big confusing hyperfuturistic mess to me. Not sure if that's just me though.The multiplayer features specialist weapons and abilities, which one can use after charging it, which happens over time and can be accelerated by getting score. Nice idea, but in my opinion it doesn't work out quite right and balanced in game. It also features the mentioned thrusters and wall running mechanics, which at least aren't as over the top as the exosuits in Advanced Warfare. Exclusive weapons, camos, profile customization thingies and more can be unlocked from opening supply drops, which one can buy with cryptokeys, which in turn can be earnt in game or by buying CoD points with real money.The game features some other modes, such as Nightmares (a zombie compaign), a Co-op Campaign, Dead Ops Arcade and Freerunning, but I don't think they add anything to the game. The time spent developing those modes could've been better spent in other parts of the game."
,Recommended,311210,19241469,"Posted: 23 November, 2015",all,Vitriolvox,Just to be clear I haven't played COD since W@W and MW3 due to the series feeling stale and becoming detached from FPS'. The game is argueably better than W@W but off to a rough start with bugs and performance issues which most of have been fixed and are continually being worked on. Zombies is even more fun than it used to be via the new gumball and double pack a punch mechanics. Wallrunning and boosting around in MP adds something new yet fun to the somewhat stale system they had prior.Pros-Fun gunplay-Multiple Unlocks with no DLC to purchase certain weapons or skins(as of 11/23/15)-Interesting and fun campaign with an optional difficulty that makes me doubt if it was even playtested at certain points-ZombiesCons-A season pass that costs $10.00 less than the game itself-Still some OP guns that hopefully will get nerfed in the future-Minor performance and graphical issuesAs COD's go I'd say it's a 9/10 and to buy it and play online for 1 Hour and 55 Mins before deciding if you want to refund it.

I've nearly completed the campaign now (Haven't finished yet since I can play zombies.) Servers do take a few minutes to connect to since it isn't a hugely played game on steam because of competator games (Counter Strike).Really nice community too. That is if you have the voice chat turned off. Other wise you'd most likely hear people complain and ♥♥♥♥♥ about you.

They don't spam either.If you're a fan of COD or Titanfall for that matter pick this up and you won't be disapointed. It's a fresh take on the series and honestly I didn't have high expectations for it at all. To me the whole futuristic sorta theme COD has going on lately has been turning me away from the franchise but treyarch and activisions reputation has really been turned around with this latest installment in the series.After the bust with Ghosts and Advanced Warfare this is a breath of fresh air and a really good buy for your money.Definitly purchase the season pass too because the zombies is just spectacular.

If you drank everytime you had to wait for someone to open a door you would be dead halfway through the game. There are sections where you wait for someone to open a door to then WAIT FOR THEM TO OPEN ANOTHER DOOR.I know this might also sound ridiculous but the amount of people you kill is insane. You kill so many people it loses all meaning and purpose and becomes completely motonous. Bullet sponge enemies do not make the game more fun.In addition to this the huge robots that you need to shoot before you can fire rockets are THE MOST boring and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemies I have ever seen.On top of this the story is a heaping pile of rancid vomit that spewed forth from the minds of someone who sat down and played Far Cry 3 and watched Event Horizon/Avengers 2 and then thought they could put the same ideas into this game. No joke the antagonist of this game is an AI Oni demon. If you took a screenshot of the final chapter from this game and posted it ANYWHERE no one would believe it was a Call of Duty game.Absolutely terrible game and playing with friends only dulled the pain but could not remove our feeling of completely wasting our time.

Day one numerous people were having performance issues and straight up couldnt play the game at all, myself included. Day one I got as far as the activision logo then the game black screened. Later that day a very small patch came out and ever since then I have had 0 performance issues. No bugs rendering it unplayable. No frame drops. and no more connection errors than I've had anywhere else.TL;DR If you're worried about performance.. don't worry about it if you're on a decent rig.Day one issues aside, this is by far the best call of duty I've seen since mw2. I've enjoyed what little of the campaign I played. The new map shadows of evil is fantastic with some recycled mechanics as well as some interesting new ones and it is possibly my new favorite zombie map rivaled only by der riese and its remakes, and Ascension from the first blops. The Multiplayer is my favorite from any call of duty with some old guns coming back reskinned to fit the games them, some great new perks like tracker (highlights enemy footprints for a short time) and gung ho (lets you hip fire and use equipment while sprinting and climbing), and the new ""momentum based combat system"" feels fluid and is a large part of the enjoyment.TL;DR campaigns fun, multiplayer is better than ever, new zombies map is both fun and interesting."

I have all of the updated drivers for my 4790k and my gtx 980 so I should be able to run this game on max settings with no problem but i am not able to because it makes it unplayable if you are trying to play competitively. Now when I have just high settings on and ambient occlusion and some of the un needed settings off it is better but I shouldn't have to do that. I want the game to look great like it does when the settings are maxed out. Also, there is random frame drop on most of the maps in multiplayer. I will be getting a steady 140+ fps then it will suddenly drop down to 50-60 fps. Im sure it is just cause the game just came out and it is still needing optimization but it would be nice to see a change sooner than later. Nonetheless this is a great and fun game and it feels like the other Black Ops.

Mostly just Multiplayer and Zombies.OverviewMy first Call of Duty game was Call of Duty 2 and I stopped playing around the time Modern Warfare 3 came out and a lot has changed since then. Specialists breathe some well needed life into multiplayer and do a good job of switching things up with their weapon or special ability. The gunplay is actually really well done with all guns being well designed and feeling powerful to shoot. Each gun feels like it has its 'place' and there are really no trash guns that are just completely worthless or overshadowed by other guns like in the previous games. The addition of jetpacks (or jumppacks, if you want to call them that) and the ability to run on walls makes each multiplayer match feel fast paced and encourages close quarters combat. Because of this, I felt like 'pure' sniper rifle setups were a little underpowered with a lot of people running DMRs instead, but I could see on the right map snipers still working.While the multiplayer isn't particularly skillful and a lot of maps are prone to camping, the multiplayer is still very casual and it's easy to get lost in, which probably explains the popularity of the Call of Duty series to this day.Zombies is still Zombies, just with a Call of Duty feel. You survive waves to earn money to buy better guns and open new areas. I've had limited time to play around with this mode, but it seems to be what it always was. A fun little side game that has become its own thing in the Call of Duty universe.EndingIs it perfect?NoIs it a masterpiece of a game that will make you feel emotions you think you could have never felt and remember years later?No.It's casual fast paced online arena shootyness and it's done pretty good. It's something you play when you just want to turn your brain off and play a video game, and I'm ok with that."

Much of the characters and factions in the game have little backstory or even reason as to why they are there. Much of the conflict feels like a sidequest in relation to the main goal which is to chase Taylor across the globe. The biggest culprit of this is the part where you're in Egypt helping whats left of their military to fight off the CDP. Little to no reason is given why these two factions are fighting and honestly in some of the setpieces later in the game you won't really care. The ending missions after killing Taylor are execeptional comparatively. I won't go into specifics of it too much but it provides a great ending to a somewhat mediocre story. There's also a zombies story mode for all the missions which is trash, ignore it.Multiplayer:I honestly haven't had this much fun in a COD multiplayer in quite a while, the maps are excelletly made, theres lanes, choke points, flanking routes and many other things you would expect from a competetive shooter. The balancing seems to be a bit off as the auto shotty is an absolute powerhouse even at medium range killing people just a bit slower than a rifle would. Another thing is great about this game's multiplayer is the classes or ""specialists"" as they're called. Each have their own abilities and many have their use in games. Some abilities will alter speed or durability and some even temporarily give you amazing weapons like a railgun, minigun, flamethrower and even an explosive bow and arrow. My only gripe is the matchmaking, there can be six to sixteen thousand people playing at a time yet it is routinely difficult to find matches even for the most popular modes like tdm or ffa.Zombies:Zombies is fun as it always is yet the new map for this game deviates from the formula, and not exactly in a good way. The style is unique to Call of Duty and is reminiscent of H.P. Lovecraft, giving a refreshing new turn from the old nazi zombies. The mechanics of this falter however. There are items you must find around the map and objective rooms that you must activate an altar and get trapped in while enemies spawn from everywhere. This would be fine if you didn't have to do it so much. Oh and the mystery box moves randomly, so there's that.Conclusion:Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 is a solid game that uses it's mechanics to trump over its faults and become the best COD that PC has had in a while. 8/10(I will edit the review later once map creation and modding comes out for PC)"

Zombies has been a very enjoyable roller coaster ride though. The easter eggs are limitless, so much new ways of playing, fast pace decision making, well thrown out story (If I could just figure it out.). I have encountered FPS drops mainly in Zombies in really weird places. Just looking outside of a window and it drops. Multiplayer as I have said is VERY enjoyable, even for a Zombies only fan like myself.  If you dont want to take a slight risk of Activision/Treyarch fixing the technical issues and worried that your PC cant run it, maybe you shouldnt buy it and wait it out. I do recommend this game overall though.Campaign ?/10Multiplayer 7/10Zombies 9/10Once they fix the issues with FPS drops the game is golden.UPDATE: The DLC has fixed some FPS issues. Buy this game."

This game can keep you entertained for a while, until they stop coming out with dlc's.(DLC 5 IS CLOSE) What really sucks, is that the season pass is almost as much as the game itself, but it covers 4 of the DLC's. DLC 5 is assumed to be purchased separately from the season pass, and costs half as much as the season pass, which sucks.

It is fun for a short amount of playing, but you soon find yourself asking why f*** didn't he die? The hit boxes in this game are not very good to say the least, but above all I have seen the guns change significantly over time making what once a viable choice to one that has no purpose in the game since it lacks the DPS to kill anyone. Unless you are willing to grind for supply drops or simply buy them, the base guns are inferior to the ones added through the supply drop system. Also, Treyarch stabbed the users in the back by stating that supply drops will only have cosmetic items and then against the will of the community added weapons that have a VERY low chance of getting (I would compare the chance of getting a gun to that of getting a knife in CS:GO; next to impossible)However, zombies is fun to play with friends and the ability to use community made maps is fun and can add hours into this game if you like zombies. With the current pricing of this game, I would only buy it while it is on sale and advise against buying the Chronicle zombies unless you really really want to. I considered it and spent my money on something that is way more worth it; other games such as PUBG, CSGO, Civilization V, XCOM 2, Bioshock: Infinite, etc. All those game I have had more fun playing with compared to this one game that I foolishly spent about 80 dollars on for the base game, then ""all the dlc"" until they released chronicles.

I can play exactly one match of multiplayer before the memory leak goes haywire, and then every match after that I spend the first two minutes or so framerating like my PC is an epileptic in a rave. Some maps, I just framerate. Period. All the time. And it's not like it goes down to 30 fps, which would still be playable - it headbangs back and forth between 60 and f*cking ZERO faster than a cranked-out metalhead. Zombies suffers from this as well, and I don't even want to talk about the campaign.Okay, I do.It was the only reason I bought the game. No, really. I haven't played a CoD since MW2 because, let's face it, I didn't really miss much in the way of content. But this story sounded interesting to me, and I love sci-fi, and I thought, what the hell, I'll try it. I cannot even play the campaign for more than thirty seconds before it breaks down to a smooth 10 fps. Seriously? SERIOUSLY?! Why can I handle The Witcher 3's incalculably better graphics and open world without a single hitch, but this game is just, NOPE, these graphics are tooooooo good for your machine!Ridiculous. I'm so sick of this. Two patches and there has been absolutely no change. What a joke./rantThat being said: the game is fun, the gameplay itself is flawless, cyberpunk is cool, what I got out of the story so far is neato, and holy sh*t, dat robot scene at the beginning. This game has a sh*tton of potential. Here's hoping that they fix it before I completely lose interest. Again, DON'T BUY THIS GAME until it gets fixed. When they fix it, I'll update my review accordingly. Until then, they can shove my $59.99 right up their as*es. Preferably in the form of pennies."

Peel and add the bananas to a mixing bowl.5. Using a fork, mash the bananas so you’ve got a mixture of smooth and chunky, then put aside.6. Add the apple juice and stir to combine.7. In a separate bowl, beat the butter with a wooden spoon until creamy.8. Crack in the eggs one at a time, beating each one in well before adding the next.9. Fold in the flour, cinnamon, honey and banana mixture, taking care not to over mix.10. Roughly chop the pecans on a chopping board, if using, then fold through the mixture.11. Spoon into the loaf tin, then bake in the hot oven for around 40 minutes, or until golden and cooked through.12. To check if it’s done, stick a cocktail stick or skewer into the middle of the loaf, remove it after 5 seconds and if itcomes out clean the loaf’s cooked; if it’s slightly sticky it needs a bit longer.13. Allow the loaf to cool slightly, then carefully turn out on to a wire rack to cool completely.14. Transfer to a nice plate, cut into slices, then serve."

,Recommended,311210,23249715,"Posted: 28 May, 2016",all,BodyPolitic,"First off a disclaimer.  I am one of the few weirdos that play COD games for the campaign more than the multiplayer. Before the obligatory eye roll, COD4 MW really staked it's name on having a great campaign, long before it became a mainstay for multiplayer, to be played endlessly by dude-bro's chompin on Doritos. The campaigns have steadily been dropping in quality until Ghosts which I consider a low point for the series. Advanced Warfare was a decent start to get that side of the equation back on track, but  COD Blk Ops III really upped the game, hence the positive reccomendation.Won't spoil the storyline but will say this was the first COD campaign game in years where it actually felt like you where doing something different instead following the script to a hollywood movie. The addition of Cyber Powers brings a new element to the shoot and scoot gameplay that is the backbone of COD series. They allow for a different type of play, taking a more measured response allowing for some small amount of tacticle gaming. Its not Ghost Recon and never will be, but for it is, the addition  is appreciated.Rounding out the package, in a mini campaign for Zombies, a Parkour speed running side game, and suprisingly full fleged twin stick shooter with several levels and almost nintendo like map. Add in the obligatory multiplayer with its plethora of game modes and you can't say that Treyarch is skimping on content for your money.Overall a good package with lots of options and reinvigorated campaing, makes Black Ops III a solid addition to any shooter fans library. In a day and age where it's considered popular to bag on COD I think if you take the game as a game and not the baggage of the series mantle, you may just find a good time"

I cannot say for multiplayer, since it is unusual that I will play it. I don't know if people have issues with their internet, but that's just my input.------------Not enough players:... self explanetory reason------------Future theme:This is the reason that most people don't like black ops 3 and it completely baffles me. The trailer for this game showed jetpacks and a future theme. Gameplay showed jetpacks and a future theme. If you didn't like the future theme, then why did you bother to buy the game?! If you wanted else, then just play BO2 or battlefield! Let alone that, I don't see why people hate the jetpacks.

This is by far the worst call of duty I hav ever played.  The movement and aiming seems very clumsy and rushed.  The game crashed on me and erased my single player progress forcing me to replay content.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME until some serious work is put into it.  Ive played alpha games that run better.

,Not Recommended,311210,19790848,"Posted: 19 December, 2015",all,Howler Monkey,"I love the Call of Duty games, and I'm primarily a Single Player Only kind of guy which should probably show how much I love it. I have always loved the storylines as it always felt like playing a b-grade action movie: simplistic, easy to follow, and lots of explosions and set pieces to keep my testosterone fuelled erection going.But I struggle to find anything at all I liked about this game, on both technical and gameplay fronts. Graphically it is really no better than the last one, which was not much better than the last one, so it feels like it is lagging behind other titles in this genre. There was also frequent performance issues and judders in the framerate, despite having turned down the graphical settings on a farily powerful PC. I could also only play the game for no longer than one and a half hours at a time before the game would lose the connection to the server and I would be booted unceremoniously back to the main menu without my game being saved. This meant if II wanted to keep playing I would have to start that level again no matter how far I was through it, which I seldom did. It was difficult to even start when I wanted to due to frequent and longer than average load times.Gameplay in terms of the feeling and aesthetic of the gunplay is...pretty much the same. I actually found some of the guns a bit too samey in design and use so I didn't feel like I had a playstyle. This is despite the fact that Black Ops III places a huge emphasis on (albeit forgettable) customisation options. You can unlock different cybernetic powers to help you fight the enemy, such as causing all enemy earpieces to explode with static to stun them or releasing a swarm of flaming robo-bees to kill everyone in the general area, but these felt difficult to activate in the heat of battle when using a keyboard. This is only compounded by seemingly random difficulty spikes. Two confessions: Number One. I played this game entirely on the lowest difficulty. Number Two. I could not finish it. I reached a level in a dream/computer/parallel universe where gravity kept changing and I could not get past it. The game even tauntingly suggested that I turn down my difficulty setting while knowing full well that was impossible, making it the digital equivalent of the cable company from South Park rubbing their nipples at you.Additionally, some actually take a while to take effect when you use them meaning that you could have just shot everyone by the time your power was actually in use. Even though I had a fully upgraded 'tree' of powers (upgrades are also locked behind different 'trees' that classify each set of powers; only one can be active at a time) I never found myself using them more consistently than about once a level. Even the new movement mechanics ala Titanfall are forgettable and I never really used them tactically as there was little opportunity or need to. Instead I would just occasionally run along a wall while moving from one shooting gallery to the next, though usually not successfully as touching any sort of imperfection in the wall (be it a lamp or an ant) will cause you to stop wall running immediately and fall.The worst part, however, is the story which is almost incomprehensible. Characters are introduced then killed off at random, with little to no motivation revealed behind the horrific things they do while there. I would love to speak more about the plot in this review, I really would, but I honestly can't remember it. It's that forgettable and pointless. I know some famous celebrities were in it trying their best to conceal the massive hangovers they all had while recording (get ready for some of the most low-stakes line delivery ever spoken around a WMD), and that it involved chasing some senior soldier you had served under who seemed to get framed (but then unframed) for a mass murder involving putting people into some kind of Matrix like computer. I'm pretty sure the government was bad, and that Singapore(?) is somehow more screwed than Sodom and Gomorrah, but that's it. No character names, no plot arc. I remember more of the Pokerap than I do the story of Call of Duty: Black Ops III.'But this is a Multiplayer game!' you may cry. That's correct, and I'm more than willing to give it a go. It may blow me away (though it will have to be pretty good to break my addiction to Titanfall), but as long as they continue to put so much effort into their single player games they can still be criticized on them. Though the campaign sucks, it is clear a lot of effort went into it. They went to the time and effort (physical and monetary) to get celebrities to motion capture act in them. Even if it is pointless and never explained to the point of being confusing, there really are a lot of options to choose from in regards to customising powers and guns. Even if the only two cities on the planet in this game seem to be Singapore(?) and Egypt(??), the environments look like a lot of care has gone into making them. But a three year old puts a lot of time and care into that really fantastic crayon-and-pasta picture of Mummy and Daddy in a car that is also a spaceship (and also Daddy is a lizard). But we don't hang that in a gallery. We put it on the fridge and give them a hug.This game needs to go on the fridge, and the developers definitely need a hug."

At first i was put of by the new 3 hit system,but looking back, 2 hits seemed a bit harsh - now training without jugg feels less of a gamble, and enables newcomers to get a easyer taste of what Zombies has to offer, instead of potentially beeing put off.The Giant - Amazing camping map (as long as your into that haha),Shadows Of Evil - A very interesting map with lots of content even after you get your self set up (although i wouldent recomend it to a beginner),Der Eisendrache - A must have! Especialy on PC - this map is truly beautiful, a great training map that also holds some very big clues as to the where the Zombies storyline is heading!Zetsubou No Shima - My Kind Of Map, really, really EPIC! The trap is a freaking turbine, what more would you want?But theres more, mutant zombies, a mini-boss round and not to mention A freaking GAINT SPIDER BOSS!!!----------------------------------------------------------------------------MP: Very Good, but be ware, don't believe the big YTbers out there for this is NOT like Bo1 & Bo2 or MW's MP...It feels very different, like a slowed down version of AW if anything; but still enjoyable.The Futuritic movement sytem adds an extra dynamic, often resulting in slightly more challenging gunfights than seen previously in earlyer Bo's games. If your a hardcore sniper you may be disapointed as sniping in Bo3 seems quite nerft compared to Bo2, although tbh in that game quickscoping was quite OP.----------------------------------------------------------------------------Campaign: Err, this is where the game is let down - The last good Bo campain, in my opinion, was in Bo1 (Bo2's was great but let it self down when it spent too much time forcing you to stair at an Ipad instead of actual action),and this game - unfortunalty, isn't an exeption... i really would recomend just skipping this part of the game."

,Recommended,311210,31767254,Posted: 15 May,all,reazon- KURAMA,"One of the most underrated CoD games around.Albeit having a controversial advanced movement system, I've found it very easy to get used to after spending a lot of time around FPS games. After playing Counter-Strike for 3000+ hours, I've found every gun battle easily predictable, however this can take some time to get used to for new players.Pros:- Great Multiplayer:Always has a thriving playerbase. A lot of DLC weapons and camos you can get for free by just playing the game (or by spending money on CoD Points, which is also questionable for those Activision money ♥♥♥♥♥s). Most of the MP maps are flawless however some of the base game maps just are straight up dumb and have some graphical bugs/malfunctions (sorta segways into the cons as well I guess). Lots of replay-ability because of the high-level cap and Prestige modes (not to mention the VERY regular Double XP/Double Weapon XP/Double Cryptokey events they have almost every weekend).- Amazing Zombies Content:Even the base map alone (Shadows of Evil) has a very intricate design and very fun layout, which is hard to get right after having such a dreadful flagship map in the 2nd Black Ops game (Tranzit). Also, the DLC maps are f*cking incredible, each map telling stories from different iconic Zombies character to expand the storyline of the franchise. With the additions of Gobblegum machines and Weapon Kits, the Zombies on this game has been flawless. (Not to mention Zombies Chronicles/DLC 5 launching on PC next month, which is surely going to be incredible).Cons:- Mediocre Campaign Mode:From what I played of the Campaign, it was okay. Interesting ideas were used because of the futuristic setting, however it's plain to see that Call of Duty's major amount of funding and attention goes elsewhere (into Multiplayer & Zombies mainly because that's what people want). As far as campaigns go, it should really be left to Infinity Ward because I don't remember a time when they undelivered in a Campaign/Story environment (even Ghosts had a great Campaign too!).- Gun Balancing is dreadful:The multiplayer gun balancing is so far out of whack that it's actually infuriating the majority of the time. Specialists were a great add to the Multiplayer, however Specialists weapons like the Purifier that can 1 shot you with so much ease and range, and the Ripper that can just bounce and lunge between player to player and easily hit 6-mans with little to no effort is just hilariously dumb.Like every game, shotguns are really hard to get right, they're either a useless disadvantage or just break the game entirely, there's only a few games that do it right. However the shotguns on this game are broken beyond repair (by the likes of the Brecci and Haymaker). With the advanced movement system it makes it so easy to get kills with shotguns (especially on maps like Nuk3town).I still feel the LMGs, SMGs and Melee mechanics still needed to have been messed around with a little bit more before release, but they are manageable.Nevertheless, this game is amazing (aside it's gun balancing, which you do learn to deal with). I recommend it to everyone who's just tired of the basic same-old same-old FPS games (like Modern Warfare, CS:GO, Battlefield, etc.).It's Pros heavily outweigh its Cons (even though it doesn't seem like it on paper)."

There are so many clans playing this game, and if you come across them (which you will, and many times), you will be oblitorated. Same crap as always for multiplayer though.Now onto my fave, Zombies. What can I say... Weapons that you can level? Amazing! Shadows of Evil is a good sized map with plenty of things to do. A decent challenge. The Giant is an awesome map. Small in size, but you can have yourself some fun with fast kills and lots of high rounds. So. This Zombies game may be as good, if not better than Black Ops II.Now the topic everyone is on about... Graphics... I don't have a super computer as is required to play this game on ultra. As the majority of players, my max settings is Medium. FUN!

When i aim at someone my bullets go all over the screen and don't hit anything. I only play call of duty for muliplayer so i don't play campain or zombies. I don't know why this is but it seems everyone is better than me at this game. I know I should not say this game it bad just because I am bad at it but whateva. I usually play mw2 and I love that game its sort of unbalenced but its not that bad. But I am decent at mw2 and I cant barely go positive in black ops 3. I don't know I am just rantin'.  What I want to say from this is that THE MULTIPLAYER IS BAD.

It's safe and boring. It's like an old sweater warm and cozy. It's also completely underwhelming. I had been hungering for Titan Fall for a while and since Respawn fumbled the roll out and the community died on arrival I thought maybe this would scratch that itch. It doesn't the free running system feels wonky at all times and doesn't have a very good flow. Even with powers which prove they understand ingenuity every gun feels similar and none of them are that fun. The zombies modes are filled with lame mechanics like teleporting zombies that make movement a chore.

World at War and Black Ops 1 were fairly decent on PC but other than that, the yearly Call of Duty titles have always been a huge disappointment. This is no exception. The game performs terribly, the multiplayer is severely unbalanced. The campaign seems dry and rushed. Also, there is aim-assist on PC... Which is a huge downside for me. It's just another casualized CoD title. I thought Treyarch to be the CoD developer that actually puts an effort into their PC version. But I was sorely mistaken after purchasing this title. It seems they have given up and have thrown their chips entirely into the console community like the rest of them. How bad this game truly is can be reflected by the 25% drop in peak player count 1 month after it was released.TL;DR Save your money and buy something else. This is one you'll want to skip."

The wall-running, sliding, swimming, specialist weapons, they all feel great. Zombies mode is amazing, but it leans to the scavenger hunt side of things, which can get old if you play too much consecutively.You'll see as well, that many people are having issues with the game running poorly, many of these issues however, have been fixed as of writing this review. I'm not saying they're all gone, and that all are this case, but I see many rather moronic people asking why their game isn't running well when they're on an HP Pavillion that costs less than their console. I know, not everyone is part of that group, but I'd wager about half those still complaining as of this day are such people. There's also a handful of very easy fixes to some issues like the stuttering if you experience it.Once again, this is the most fun I've had in a Call of Duty game, Zombies is spectacular, the Campaign is surprisingly good as well, especially with personal loadouts, 4-player co-op, and many powers derived from the specialists in multiplayer. Then there is the multiplayer, still the CoD formula, with plenty of new tricks, and an added feel of slight verticality, you and other players can often go above and below, underwater or along buildings. It seems this time around they took a note from Titanfall's great gameplay, and mixed it in with some of CoD's most stellar weapons in both visual design and feel.All in all, I love this game, and having not played a CoD game since Modern Warfare 3, everything feels incredibly fresh. I'd recommend, at the very least, trying this game, because it's not just 'another Call of Duty'."

The new movement system speeds up the pace of the game leading to a more entertaining game.2. The new weapons brought originally at the start of the game including new Black Market content.3. The maps give a different feel to the Black Ops series. Including, the DLC.4. The DLC. Let's see.-->Awakening: Der Eisendrache and Skyjacked.-->Eclipse: Zetsoubu No Shima introducing the Multiplayer Black Market Weapons.Why don't I like this game sometimes?-->It simply comes down to the optimization of the game that the PC Devs. refused to provide us.Multiplayer:1. Clear Console Port with no consideration on the effects of console patches placed on the PC Community.2. Because of the crap port we've been provided, we have an infestation of abusive controller users who don't necessarily have a 'hack' per say. However, they are given a clear unfair advantage being able to lock onto others ingame.Zombies:1. As much as I love Zombies in Black Ops III as it was the reason I enjoy Zombies so much now. This game started my enjoyment for Zombies completly, but the servers are complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ Immediately, you'll notice the Host Migration system implemented on Zombies BO3 Servers. What is it necessarily? Basically just like in Consoles, when the first person in the server joins (That person becomes the host of the server) causing the effect of where if the person leaves ingame, the server has to recalibrate to make someone else a host. Now why is this such a problem? Well, it shows the lack of dedication to PC BO3 Servers as well.My Opinion:--> Altough I'm more than sure people won't agree with me by saying off the bat, ""Black Ops 3 is♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; or ""Black Ops 3 is gay"", I still think the game has potential in the game itself.

I wish you could have more than 5 though. 8/10.Gun Customization: Very in-depth compared to MW2, much improved, problem is it doesnt become immediately clear how you can customize your camo and stuff for guns, or your sights specifically, it's such a random tiny button.... 6/10Specialists system: Instead of just being a soldier, you're now a super soldier, each with 2 different abilities you have to unlock to use. I really REALLY dont like this system, it gives experienced players a decidedly HARDCORE edge on plays who are new, being insta-killed by some dude slamming into the ground every 10 seconds isn't fun. It should be reworked to be less intrusive on the entire experience. 4/10Guns: Not much to say, I dont recognize any of the guns, they dont look interesting or feel interesting, when you hit someone you dont feel liek you HIT them with a bullet, if feels like laser tag more than a combat zone, really disappointed. 2/10Graphics: They're pretty good, no complaints, typical CoD. 8/10.Maps/Map Design: The maps are all boring. I mean BORING. No verticality to them at all, every gun fight feels like it's on even grounds, there's no where to sit back and snipe like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or anything, the maps all look and feel similar. 3/10.Running/Sliding/Wall running: It's a pretty good idea for an FPS to try things like this, I dont mind it IF and only IF it's in a futuristic game, NOT a modern one. Sadly, it looks dull to see someone walk along a wall, I thought they should be using momentum to run, but they stroll against walls like they have suction cups on their boots, not very cool to watch. 7/10Jet Packs: I really REALLY like the idea, adds to the almost disastrous verticality of the game itself. 10/10TOTAL: 48/80 (or translated to 100 points) = 60/100. Large learning curve, you've been warned. If you enjoy CoD, it's not the worst."

I'm enjoyed it a great deal, here's why:Single Player - While the single player storyline is somewhat predictible and the characters aren't overtly complex, it's good. It's a video game, if you want a super complex story wtih a obscure character development grab a copy of Ulysses by Joyce. It's enjoyable to play through and it accomplished what I believe it was designed to do... teach you how to use everything for multiplayer.Zombies - Cheesy as most zombie portions are but fun so far, haven't spent a ton of time there yetMultiplayer - Ok... it's been many years since my rocket area days with many of those spent in MMos. At this point I'm just a shawdow of my former self but you know what? I'm learning, I'm dying, but I'm getting more and more kills and gaining ground again in Deathmatch! I played some BO2 but felt it eventually got off balance, right now, BO3 multiplayer is fantastic. No I'm not Prestige level yet but holding my own, been provided with some nice skins even for being somewhat of a newb again and all that makes me want to keep playing and I think that is the key for this game in the long run.The graphics are... stunning. Running a 280x with pretty much everything maxed at 1080p the eye candy is definitely satisfying!Would I recommend this? Yea, it's not perfect but it's fun.

The zombies are very strong and have lots of content, muiltplayer is balanced and introduces specialists which are questionable but overall pretty enjoyable. The campaign is your average COD campaign, running around and shooting stuff with only more enemies that take more bullets. This game is solid and a good comeback for COD, but will be overlooked by Fallout 4 unless you're a hardcore COD player."

The campaign is the usual over the top cod-ness weve come to expect over the years, but it is executed very well, making the campaign a very enjoyable part of the game. Multiplayer, as always is a whole different beast. Executed well, the wall running and jet jums are fixed from their broken state in AW, and have become an integral part of the maps themselves.

TBH, I am a huge hater on everything cod, but this game is different, the movement and fast pace of it hasn't been matched in any previous cod, and this game adds more depth with the movements.  Also there's parkour mode so GG.7.7/10- Best COD in years."
,Not Recommended,311210,20739737,"Posted: 24 January, 2016",all,The Fence,"Score: 4/10 for PC5/10 for ConsoleTL;DRI would not recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the old COD Multiplayer. I have put in a lot of hours into this game on my PC and my PS4, and I would reccomend to get it on the console if you do decide to get this game, there are a whole lot less cheap semi-auto snipers and shotguns.The maps are also way too small and easy to get across with incredibly crappy re-spawns behind or surrounded by enemies.Campaign and Zombies are pretty fun to go through with friends mowing down enemies and zombies.Only get this game on sale at 40% off or more if you do decide to get it and really want to play zombies.Multiplayer:___________________Some Guns I Really Don't Like:_____________________________________On console there are less players who rely heavily on the use of semi-automatic shotguns and sniper rifles, the PC version has at least 2 people on either side with one of these. Sure they are a part of the game, but these guns are completely broken. Put an ELO sight on a Drakon (semi-auto) or a P-06 (a burst fire after a charge sniper) and you can watch your kill count go up. A Brecci (semi-auto shotgun) or Haymaker (automatic Shotgun) with long barrel and rapid fire with a Gung-Ho perk will make you nearly unstoppable at mid to close range, beating even SMG's and Assult Rifles.Other guns are somewhat more balanced than these and are beatable. The SMG's and AR's are still pretty viable in their respective ranges, although the maps don't help all that much.______________________________Maps:_________________________________________Most maps don't really give you any space to properly snipe or have long distance battles. What you get are aquariums with tight corners and tunnels, or crumbling buildings with medium to small rooms, or the occasional rustic village with an open court yard and two facing buildings between it that might work for proper sniping.All of the maps were created with the jetpacks and wall running in mind which I don't mind. They did large maps fairly well in Advanced Warfare, but all of the maps in Black Ops 3 are way too small in my opinion. In Ghosts there were usually wide open maps with a use for snipers as they could cover people getting in close. BO3 feels more like everyone wants to be an action hero and flies in guns-a-blazing through a hail of bullets._________________________Specialists:______________________________________Specialists are your characters each with their own 2 unique powers which you can unlock at certain levels in Multiplayer. You can't make use of them all right away, but a handful are available if you have an unlock token with your first pick being a permanent unlock. These two powers comes in  the form of a weapon and a utility.I would have to say these are actually pretty balanced with some being a bit broken; THE WAR MACHINE. The War Machine is the grenade launcher that fires 3 grenades that explode on contact or over a short time and can be insane when some sprays and prays. Others are more tame like an armor that lasts a few seconds that protects your body, but leaves your head open.These two unique powers are for the same character and each character has something similar and they can all be pretty fun to use. I definitely recommend you try them all at some point.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Campaign and NightmaresThis scenario was pretty good in my opinion. I went through it with some friends on the hardest difficulty, REALISTIC, and we enjoyed the challenge. They also added some interesting power-ups in the campaign as well.You could control or blow up robots with your cybernetically connected mind, send nano-bugs to murder (and I mean MURDER) your enemies, or you could just charge right through them with your cyber-legs, knocking them into the air like a cartoon.Your character in the campaign was unique to how you wanted to play, I played the supporting roles where I would revive, remove robots, etc. but it felt like when I played with my friends, I was part of a team and not just the usual solo campaign where I was a one-man army.The story was pretty generic in my opinion but I still had fun, mostly because of the difficulty and my friends, but enjoyable the whole time.Nightmares on the other hand was just a re-skinned Campaign full of zombies from the Zombies scenario, sometimes it had different audio and the stages were in a different order. I still enjoyed it even through I really thought this part was really half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥_________________________________________________________________________________Zombies:With a group of friends or strangers this can be really fun and for those of you looking to learn a little more about zombies, you might, you might not. It has a lot of things you could customize similar to campaign where you can level yourself up and earn the rights to use different guns and different perks.In this mode you could make use of perks through gumball machines powered by your Cth'ulu electro blasts, more on that later.Later: You play one of 4 characters who can all turn into a tentacle monster to open new paths through smashing walls, boxes, electro blasting fuse boxes and grapple hooking onto gargoyle heads or whatever. This mode makes you invincible (I think) and is pretty handy for reviving teammates and only lasts a short while.You can also pick up parts for a black hole gun and a riot shield you can dash through enemies with.I don't know all of the easter eggs but I'm sure you can check a Youtube video for those._______________________________________________________________________________Overall:LIke my TL;DR if you are playing this game for the multiplayer on PC get ready for some squeakers, shotguns and semi-auto snipers. If you aren't then you might have more fun. I do enjoy multiplayer don't get me wrong, but I really don't like what they did with shotguns and snipers and the maps.The campaign and zombies were fun, but multiplayer, which is one of my favorite parts of the game, really ruined it for me."

,Not Recommended,311210,32610174,Posted: 20 June,all,Serpy Serperior,"TL;DR: Amazing zombie game with lots of player freedomTHE ENEMIESThe enemies in 7dtd consist of zombies, zombie dogs and bears.Generic zombies are the biggest threat to your survival in 7dtd. There will be a huge amount of zombies spawning at all times, depending on how ""noticable"" the actions you do are. For example, using a campfire will attract more zombies then doing something small like opening your backpack. The zombies run at night, and can break any block in the game. They have a large amount of health and can kill you quickly if you are not careful.Zombie dogs, although rare, can be a serious threat to you if you are not careful. They have a small hitbox, do a huge ammount of damage, and run regardless of the time of day. They spawn most often in the wasteland biome and often appear with hordes of zombies.Bears are a small threat to you, as they have a low spawn rate and you need to get close to them for them to attack you. When you kill them though, you can get some good resources that can boost your progress.PLAYER FREEDOM7dtd has 99% player freedom, with every bit of terrain and buildings can be destroyed. You can also use a variety of blocks to build and defend a shelter, and craft a huge assortment of makeshift items. The only real things that block player freedom are that the huge hub city in the center of the map, and other settlements of varying size, are unclearable. 7dtd also has skills you can level up to make you more proficient with certain types of tools, but there are bugs with the system in numerous areas.ISSUES7dtd, as good as it is, has some huge issues in it. There are lots of bugs with the random gen world, and the game isn't very optimized. Enemies constantly have bugged hitboxes, mostly zombie dogs. The gunplay in 7dtd needs improvement. Some parts of the gameplay can be tedious, like leveling up skills to get better quality weapons and armor. Using some things like a forge take to much time to use, and don't give enough resources.CONCLUSION7dtd is a fun, although tedious, zombie survival game. If you want pvp zombie survival you should probably look for something more like dayZ, but for coop and singleplayer this game shines. Just don't buy this game expecting a finished, polished game."

Now many of you go further than that but for me, that's where I started.Story Line - Incredibly confusing at the ending to the point where I just ended up rushing the levels so I can complete it already. The Customisation is incredible and the way you can alter the game to your play style is great. All in all, it has it's pros and cons. However, I just can't seem to find a ground breaking feature that really grabs me. As we all know, CoD has hit a plateau as regards story line (and some of you believe as a game)MultiPlayer - I was pleased to see that the stupid jumping around from AW was toned down a lot. However, this still means you can still run on walls, boost jump everywhere (fairly limited but you'll be kill them or vise versa before you're out of boost) and it seems recoil has finally hit this Title.On another note, there is no Riot shield meaning no Shield+C4/Axe throwers and this made me happy. If you enjoyed the old CoDs' but thought that AW sucked because of the silly Exo suits then this might just be £40 worth spending.Zombies - I am pleased to say that Zombies is a lot more Immersive. For those who played BO2 zombies and used the different special equipment (Staffs in Origins) and what not then this could be for you. The Orignal standard map Shadows of Evil is a very deep and interesting play. There is lots to do, lots to learn and a hell of a challenge to get to grips with. As with all Zombie maps before hand, you have many ways of surviving and plans to stop yourself from getting Rekt. It's different and similar in a way I enjoy. I wouldn't reccomend watching youtube videos on how to play this complex game mode, but more as to what's different from BO2/1. If you like leveling up games, then you'll be happy to hear leveling up in Zombies has its perks. Gun customisation is something I wasn't expecting but am happy to see they put such thought in what used to be just a minigame many years ago.Anyway, to sum up. If you enjoyed all CoD games but AW because of it's silly Exo suits, then this might be worth a try. Campaigne is nothing special and Zombies is something to try out for those zombies lovers. I may have a BF4 Avatar, but as far as my CoD Experience goes, this is worth the somewhat small price of £40 for a new game in 2015. What are you waiting for? It's only 56GB!"

I'm especially happy with the fact that modding tools will be released, so the great minds behind WAW custom zombies can splooge their creativity all over.To answer the cries of help from all the revies below mine. Update your graphics card drivers. The game was unplayable with my GTX 970 until I updated them. NVIDIA released BO3 drivers right after the game came out. The game is not poorly optimised.

Zombies, The Giant is fun, SoE isn't the best for the first few tries (once you get used to it it's actually really fun) Campaign has been better but not bad, Nightmare mode is really fun and makes you see the campaign in a whole new way. The weapons in mp are all great, the paintshop and gunsmith system is not a good as I thought it would be but I could still make my camos and weapons I wanted. Overall, it's actually one of my favourite CoDs of all time, I would recommend you get it for Xbox One or Ps4 if your Pc can't run it, if you don't have one then just live with really low settings for PC."

Never got big into multiplayer, mostly cause I suck at it, and call of duty multiplayer has become transaction central. I stopped playing multuplayer when guns like the Peacekeeper Mk. 2 were introduced that broke the game and were just extremely OP. Besides, I think the PC BO3 multiplayer community is dead and on the multiplayer side of things I would stick to games like csgo. Regardless, I have sunk over 400 hours into the game on Xbox one mainly on zombies, and cannot wait until custom zombies comes out. I definetely reccomend this game to anyone looking for a fun zombie shooter game where you don't have to worry about thirst, stamina, or hunger meters. I reccomend getting this game while it is on sale because the DLC can be a bit pricey if you are aiming to play it all.If you are looking for a realistic war game, this is probably not the game for you, however, if you like fun arcade shooters, I reccomend giving Black Ops 3 a try. I do not reccomend to buy the digital deluxe version, due to the fact that you may not like the game, or it may not run on your system. Black Ops 3 requires a pretty good pc to run well, as I am sure you have read in other reviews stating that the game is not well optimized for the pc."

,Recommended,311210,23266571,"Posted: 28 May, 2016",all,Mr. Wallet,"Single player: The writing is pretty dumb but it's fun to play through, and toward the end it has Robert Picardo which is kind of neat. The levels have some absolutely gorgeous setpieces so if you're into that sort of thing they're nice to play in. No big complaints. This ends the single player portion of the review.Zombies is very, very hard to get into if you've never played Zombies on a previous CoD, which is the case with me. I could learn how to play it by reading enough guides and watching enough YouTube videos, but personally it doesn't seem like the time investment is worth it. If you're into Zombies then I'm afraid I don't have a review for you. If you're not, my review is: don't let the promise of Zombies influence your purchase at all.The rest of what follows is for the PvP multiplayer, which is the only reason I ever buy these games:Probably the best CoD since Modern Warfare 3 (I've only played about half of the ones since then: the best-reviewed ones). Still twitchier/spazzier than the old Infinity Ward stuff but it doesn't suffer from the same Black Ops 2 problem where a duel is already decided the moment you see each other. In BO2, the guns all kill too fast to try and recover from a disadvantage, so a winning strategy is to literally iron sight all the time absolutely everywhere. In BO3, by contrast, even ""hardcore"" mode feels more reactive, and the game rewards quick thinking much better than previous Treyarch titles.The guns are also more clearly defined than in any other CoD I've ever seen. Once you use a gun for 1 or 2 magazines you have absolutely no doubt as to its role, and all weapon classes except AR and SMG have fewer weapons which actually helps define the guns. There's 3 pistols: semi-auto, burst, full-auto. That's it. You know exactly what you're getting, and any assumptions you want to make about effective range, recoil, and DPS based on those 3 roles are totally correct. That's what I mean by clearly-defined guns. And having a pistol sidearm can actually be useful on many kits, which to my knowledge is a first for the series.A few create-a-class elements are poorly balanced so as to be completely useless. But surprising is just how many of the options feel totally fine because nothing's really tuned up to dominate over the rest. I'm sure at the super-competitive level a handful of guns are ""the meta"", but if you take the time to learn each gun then the vast majority of equippables feel perfectly viable in pubs on a map with appropriate distances. Only a few attachment choices feel sensical on any given gun, but there's lots of guns, perks, attachments, and equipment to play with that all seem pretty good at whatever it is they do.Specialists are a gimmick. They add a tiny bit to gameplay but basically it has all the impact of an 11th point in Create A Class. They're mostly balanced around standard play so Hardcore fans will be disappointed at the small handful of viable options.At 210 hours I haven't dropped a cent on DLC or in-game currency, nor am I particularly tempted to. There's enough content that the base game is worth the price. My advice for anyone bothering to read reviews this late after the game's release is to start with the multiplayer, then upgrade to the full game for single player & prestige mode if you get to max level and decide you're into it."

I have an i7, GTX 980, 16Gb RAM, and run this game perfectly fine. (With very occasional frame drops) Now you might say well I don't have that rig so maybe I can't run it. Obviously there are thousands of people with lower end graphics cards that can run the game fine, because they are all playing it. The number of complaints on steam is nothing compared to the number of people playing the game.I think this is one of the best COD multiplayer experiences to date. They took all the good elements of the previous black ops games and modern warfare games, and combined them into this masterpeice. Weapons are actually pretty balanced, the mobility is awesome, scorestreaks are satisfying to you and not overwhelming to the enemy team, time to kill is where it should be (way longer than than AW and Ghosts)."

In my personal opinion, the game itself is worth roughly over 35.99 From the optimization issues compared to console to the lag. Aside the issues, or, should I say, technical issues, this game sets a foundation for a new generation of money looting from teenagers, adults, and children. The supply drop system is horrible, like, i'm not spending my last 15 bucks on supply drops only to be dissapointed. I'd much rather buy 2 or 4 in a random pack, which contains guarenteed weapons for $15. If Activision is gonna lie to us that supply drops were only going to contain cosmetics, they'd be better off using lube. Pay attention people, because this is the farthest you'll get to a real review, rather than an a** kissing (excuse my language) youtube journalism company who gives the reviews for money rather than purifing the hell we're in called the gaming community. So, like i said, the supply drop system is horrible. Why would i spend real money for something i have a better chance at getting struck by lighting than having? This isn't a free to play game! I already spent $30, (or $60 for others) and now i have to pay more to get the full expirience, with new weapons? The nail in the coffin is that DLC still costs money, aside season pass, even if you have already given up money for a chance at a weapon. Enough ranting about how much of a scam move this was.Concluding, was this game worth $30? Yeah, aside the op/lag issues. I would not reccomend this to anyone willing to pay full price. What you're expecting is call of duty. What you get is War and Pay online."

However, on Black ops 2 there is no one to play with. But in Black ops 3, my experience has been mixed for a few reasons. Keep in mind, I love Call of Duty games made by treyarch because I enjoy zombies. If treyarch's name isn't slapped on the steam page or game box, I won't buy it. With that being said, Activision knows that they have a hit franchise, and they are willing to milk all of the cash they can get out of it. Which is very unfortunate because microtransactions suck. I'm okay with things like DLC and map packs, but this pay to win, and pay for basic functions B.S. is a plague that affects not only BO3,  but it affects the whole gaming industry. On the other hand, this game is one of the many reasons I'm a PC gamer today. I was sick of a sub-par experience that my Xbox One provided. Even though the Xbox One has console optimization on it's side, my $400 PC that I salvaged from old workstation parts was able to play this game at an average 60 fps (with frame rate cap) on medium-high settings at full 1080P...

My fps moves so much up and down and i have my settings to low and i get like 60-120 fps and they keep dropping so fast then going back up then down then up. Also lag spikes every 5 seconds. Knifers so many of them. Snipers aren't that big. So far it's ok but if you want to get this game for multiplayer, I'd give it 6/10Zombies: zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz oh i'm sorry i'm too busy playing the 1 map they gave us if we dont pay another $20. Zombie is fun but 1 map come on. Bo2 gave us 4 maps with no dlcs. Sure they weren't the best, but it was more than 1."

,Recommended,311210,19399587,"Posted: 30 November, 2015",all,ケツを食べる,"Black Ops 3 ReviewBlack Ops 3 is SO much better than people give credit. First, change everything you expect from CoD, CoD is a fast paced arcade shooter and should be seen as such. The multiplayer, except a few guns which aren't even that op and some specialists, is the most balanced call of duty at launch to my knowledge. Specialists add a new level of strategy during multiplayer, they all take their own bit of skill to use and when to use them. They are all fairly easy to counter and just need some planning. Zombies is perfect, if you like bo2, waw, or bo1 zombies, Black ops 3 zombies is those on steroids, nuff said. Unfortunately, the campaign feels like a 20 hour story chopped up to make it 6 hours. It skips 5 in game years of plot and character development. It never explained who the CDP is, why i should care about Taylor or coalesense, or even Sarah and Diaz. Overall, play black ops 3 for multiplayer and ZOMBIES ZOMBIES ZOMBIES, you can just buy this game for zombies.Pros+campaign+amazing zombies+balanced multiplayer+amazing score streaks+specialists as a whole+nuk3town no matter what on PC+really good maps+PC mod tools coming later in 2016+Arena as a whole+movement system (WAY better than AW)Cons-Campaign-lag issues-texture issues on some PCs-rubber banding-fixed but some reticle issues-safeguard (still needs patches)-no Momentum game mode-gun game is only party mode-gun game full of afk cryptokey farmers-Arena needs balancingBlack ops 3 is worth the $60 don't listen to the bad reviews7/10 still better than Advanced Warfare"

Saddly Call of Duty is runnning itself into the ground further cutting off the true fans of the series with yearly installments that seem to further insult the fanbase. The game as a standalone title would be poor, as a cod title it is even worse.Pros:The Roman Numeral 3.Modtools Coming in March.Dedicated Servers.Cons:Poor Optimization for lower end systems.Corupt Publisher.Lack of Feature Extentions in Emblem Creator.Lack of New Engine (Quake).Vram is off the charts 2gb should still be enough on 1080p.125hz max polling rate on mice.Little to no performance difference between low and ultra settings.Lack of Competitive Play.Lack of a good relationship with game developers after world at war.Lack of map and enemy callouts?Small details gunplay, movement, aim.This will be the last Cod, for atleast the next 3 years that I ever purchase.  Activition and Treyarch need to work harder to make call of duty a title that is respected amongst the comunity once again. This can be done through:Better Direct Communication though forums.More Game updates post launch that add new features, weapons, and maps for FREE.More support for a competitive communtity.Adding full game modification back into the series.Better buisness plan consumers will buy a game if they like it. They ""shouldn't"" if they dont.  Consumers have power. Power that has been cloaked by publishers that want to us to keep buying their games regardless of how poor the games are."

But a friend with a similar system got it, and said it worked well, so when it went on sale, I pulled the trigger.I have an intel 2500 processor and a 980gtx with 8 gigs of ram.  The game works for me great totally maxed out on this system (1920 X 1080).  I'm getting 60-80 frames a second just about all the time, and usually higher.  I'm behind in video drivers (running version 350.12, so if I get current, it could well be better. I'm a late updater on video drivers, let the other guys be the beta testers :)So if you are waiting because of performance anxiety ;) then I would say that they have patched the problems.  I admit that I have a pretty good video card, but I'm maxed out, so even if you don't, you will probably be ok.  And my CPU is behind the times.I've got 10 hours as of this post.  About 2 in co-op campaign mode (which works great), and the rest in multiplayer, with a few minutes of zombies thrown in.  I like the perk system, the specialists are fun and well implemented, and there are plenty of multiplayer modes.  The movement, with double and triple jumping and wall running is vastly better than AW, a game I did not care for.  The story, so far, is better than AW and Ghost by a long shot.One thing to watch for: I did notice that when I applied ""upgrades"" to my character (done through a branching tree, like borderlands), if I didn't pick the right ones, meaning the ones that the campaign game expected me to have, it caused problems.  For example, I played the campaign for awhile, and used wall running and hacking to take over drones.  Then I discovered the ""upgrades"" and chose other stuff.  When I jumped back into the campaign, I realized that since I had chosen other stuff, I could no longer hack and wall run.  This was disappointing, but so far, I have been able to progress anyway.  Will see if that causes problems as I go.All in all, well worth the money, and I'm sure I will get many hours of fun out of Black Ops III."

Overall, I would still recommend this game. haven't experienced a good Call of Duty in a long time, and this takes it to the next level.  This is what the idea of exo-suits should be; no special abilities (like invisibility), and no rocketing forward, just simply jet gliding and wall running.  In my opinion, Call of Duty: Ghosts wasn't great, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare had some good ideas, but executed them terribly, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 took what Advanced Warfare should've been and made it better.  I don't regret spending my money on this game, it's allowed me to enjoy the series I've so desperately been waiting for.  Thanks Treyarch.Bonus: you can see your feet.10/10"

They took the whole jump pack thing and re worked it to perfection. it's not over powered what so ever if that's the main reason your not buying the game. I'll list things I Love, like and hate. so lets get started!LOVE-Campaign -  I'm not sure why people said it was bad but i really like it so far and think it's going great! Some good contect on there.-Freefun - fun little game mode with a few maps to enjoy. Run to try and beat your score over and over!-Zombies - now what's not to like about zombies? action packed and more content in the one map to make you wanna play it over and over again!MP- now i'll get into this later but just looking at the front cover of it...it's great. period.LIKEI like the speclist choice you can make in MP. If you are a CQB up close type of guy...they got one for you!like blowing stuff up? well they got one for that too, sneaky? also got that! many to choose from right from the game, let alone the up coming map packs.I like the amount of guns in the game and i'm not board of them at all. Snipers are great and for all you quickscopers out there. they got a great gun for that. SMG's are good but could use a buff. AR's are also really fun to use. long story short they are all great!HATEThe perks in this game are limited and don't really help much out on the battle field. sure there are a few good ones but nothing big.maps, Now don't get me wrong. I like the maps in this game, but they have no fluency. No combied wall running areas other then Nuk3Town. Wish they added some more wall running area's that you could really get the jumping going.Killstreaks -These have got to be the most dissapointing thing in this game, I liked it back in MW2 when you tried to get kills and stay alive you got rewarded with great kill streaks to take control over the map. The nuke was one of the best steaks since if someone was trying to get one you could forge out and try and stop them. This game tries and fails with it's uneventful steaks...I'm sure there are other area's i haven't touched on this game but this is my review and i say yes you should buy this game! so much fun and a ton of content right out of the box(or steam library)My final score 9.0"

I spent around 11-13 hours on the first day of me buying cod bo3 (bought when it was on sale from $60 to $35) and I so far only see some negative things:Positive :× A lot to the game. Unlike csgo,  it's different every time,  from wall bangs to trick shots, there are so much more you do in this game than other games I've played on other accounts.× There aren't that many mic spammers.  In csgo there are a lot of toxic players and mic(or djs) spammers,  but in cod there isn't that many mic spammers and if there are it's really easy to mute on the game.× Skins. Like csgo you can get rare skins from crates or missions, some that have really cool and detailed designs.Negative :× Cannot trade.  To my knowledge you cannot trade,  so what you unbox from a crate is just for show or for self pleasure to get something that's rare.× Some major sound glitches and alt tab glitches. (might be just me) When I alt tab to (for an example)  answer a Skype call,  it takes a little long for me to get out/in the game,  and when it does it shows that it is windowed some sorts and have to completely restart.× ranks/skill groups minimized. It's hard to find people of equal skill. There always seems to be someone carrying on tdm.I know that this is a complete game for csgo but I like the skill full games from csgo."

,Recommended,311210,22602966,"Posted: 23 April, 2016",all,PepeMeister,"So, now I get to redo my full review because the game actually is changing for the better in my eyes, and I fixed my whole lagging issue which I will tell you how I did that.So first off I'm just going to say how I managed to fix the game stuttering like crazy and taking ages to load even when I was loaded in, first off I realized my ram wasn't at the clock speed I had put it at, for some reason that had reset so I changed that back to normal.  And I think something that had the biggest impact was this article.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=549105008&insideModal=0I followed every single step and Instead of the game lag spiking for a minute when I load in, that didn't even happen once, so I can finally play the game without constant lag spikes, which I'm happy with because this game is actually pretty fun.Personally I think they nailed the movement system, and everyone is just hating on it because its a futurestic call of duty, but for what it is I think it's pretty damn good.  Zombies is super complicated but once you know what you're doing its pretty fun, the reason its complicated is to keep it interesting, but I do wish they would add one story heavy map and then a map just to see how far you can get if that makes sense.  I still have yet to play the campain but I've heard its rather good.  But when it comes to multiplayer, it's pc.. and along with every pc call of duty there isn't enough players to fill every mode, so you are most likely gonna be playing a lot of TDM and DOM, and whatever gamemode they decide to make double XP.Lately there has been a lot of people complaining about supply drops and how they are just making the game pay to win, which I do somewhat agree with, but now they kinda fixed it by adding contracts to the game, which allow you to do a misson in game and then you get a free 10 rare supply drops and one supply drop that promises you one of the new weapons from what I understand which I think is a decent fix for the issue.

The new weapons, while difficult to get used to at first, due to them being completely unfamiliar, are a lot of fun to use. There's actually good snipers and shotguns in zombies for once. I feel like they could've included at least one extra zombies map in the base game though ( In the same vain as the Five map in the original Black Ops )The campaign is probably my lowest point at the moment, i can barely play it, and i have a good pc.Pros:-Distinguishes itself from previous installments in a meaningful way.-Lots of content-Lots of NEW content-Genuinely fun-Looks greatCons:-Uses too much RAM-Performance issues CPU-wise-Only one zombies map includedGive this game a try."

It's really hard to do this when there is a zombie jumping point in front of the other side of the wall so if were to run across i'd get blocked by the jumping zombie and fall down in the death pit.I dont think this makes any sense to why it's even possible when its required for you to run across to be able to pack-a-punch you're weapons.

,Recommended,311210,33939145,Posted: 31 July,all,hi,"tl;dr version at the bottompersonally, i think that out of the black ops games, this campaign was the weakest one. i'm not saying that the campaign is bad, but compared to the campaigns of 1 and 2, which were more story driven, this one kinda felt meh. however, it's nice to see that campaign has its own levelling system, and lets you customize and bring the guns that you want into missions. being able to play the campaign in full co-op with your friends is very nice as well. black ops 3 campaign also has a realistic difficulty, which is a tier above veteran.the multiplayer was promising. the fast-paced action is thrilling, and there are so many ways to play, with wild cards allowing you to put on more perks or even attachments than normally possible in other cod games. the game also lets you choose between a variety of specialists, each with their special weapon/ability. adding thrusters and wall-running into the mix also makes for more varied gameplay.however, due to the many playstyles available, and combined with certain specialists as well as some questionably over-powered killstreaks, the multiplayer is quite frankly unbalanced. it's kinda saddening that in most cases, an SMG can be used to beat an assault rifle even in medium range. the snipers and shotguns are still viable, but a little too much that they are broken. the black market exclusive weapons that can only be obtained from supply drops dont help either.zombies is another story. new to bo3, you can now kit your weapons out for zombies through a levelling system, with the ability to equip fast mags on pretty much every weapon once it is maxed or near max level. the mod tools are also released to the public, so you can search on the steam workshop for custom maps if official ones get boring. however, some might look down at zombies in bo3 due to its gobblegum system: by using your in-game points during a zombies match, you have a chance to get liquid divinium by purchasing doors, weapons, perks as normal in a game. a 5th dlc not included in the season pass called zombies chronicles has also been released, with 8 fully remastered maps from waw, bo1, and bo2.you can then later use those as keys of a sort to get mega gobblegums. you get about 15 standard gobblegums that have unlimited usages as you progress through the ranks, but only about 4 are worth using. there are complaints that these make zombies way too easy, since for example there is a gum that straight up gives you every perk and ignores the 4 perk limit. however, anyone with skill at zombies in a previous treyarch game won't need to use gobblegums at all, since it is fairly balanced unlike multiplayer. zombies is in no way p2w with its gobblegum features and is possible to go high rounds without the usage of megas.the public games are horrible, since everyone just uses perkaholic, and due to their lack of skill will alt+f4 when they die to keep their perkaholic. if you have no friends, it's unlikely you should buy this game just for zombies. if you have a friend or two, however, buying this game along with the season pass (for the zombie maps, of course) and possibly zombies chronicles would be worth it. there are also not very many zombies challenges to unlock playercards like multiplayer has, along with a lack of cool reticles/camos from playing zombies, but it's not too big of a deal.as a bonus, there is a special zombie version of campaign called nightmares, basic freerun maps to get started, and what most people are probably looking forward to, dead ops arcade 2. doa2 can be played with others just like the first one from bo1.at the end, i would recommend this game, but only because of the amazing work done on zombies. if you buy this game for zombies, i also recommend you at least try the campaign as well. it might not be as good as bo1 or bo2, but it is still decent, and co-op campaign might make the experience better.tl;drcampaign: good but not much story 7/10multiplayer: barely playable unless you play spectre + use an op weapon 4/10zombies: best one out of the series. DLC 5 has 8 remastered maps and the mod tools are released to the public which means custom maps if you get bored of the official ones 9.5/10"

But Zombies? There is nothing I can hold against it as a Zombies fanboy, Gobblegum is a great new feature, SoE is a pretty complicated  but fun and enjoyable map, the whole mode is basically refined and tuned to near perfection. The only downside for me, is the fact that we as a CoD community are straying too far into the future. I and many others would love to see Treyarch backtrack to  say WW2 again, or the Vietnam war as a whole, rather than a couple missions like in Black Ops. If they did backtrack, with these great graphics, the beautiful Zombies mode, the enjoyable campaign, and the critically acclaimed multiplayer of OG-style ideas, and completely original concepts would make for a very good game. I rate this a:6/10 - There is room for improvement.Helpful coming from a 13-year-old kid?"
,Recommended,311210,19579592,"Posted: 9 December, 2015",all,tio,"I played CoD since the first entry in the series. I started to play the multiplayer with CoD4. So I have some years of experience on my name. Is this the best CoD ever made? No. Is this next gen gaming? Not really. But all in all it's a solid game.The singleplayer is the same as every year. Only as deep as a pool for children, but the story (Micheal Bays definition of story, of course) entertaining nonetheless. What really should entertain you in the singleplayer is the coop. The more open levels and the special abilities are fun to play around with and even more so with friends. Alone, I would say ""meh"" and be done with it, but with friends its more of a ""eh? Interesting!""Same♥♥♥♥♥♥different year applies very well to the multiplayer. The community is toxic as ever, you die only because of lag and being shot in the back and 90% of your lost games is the fault of your team. No, really. Well at least the last two point. The jumping mechanics make it very easy to flank your enemies and many players don’t even notice. (Casual Noobs :P ) I played mostly domination so far and most of the time only 2 out of 5 members are even trying to capture points. It’s hard to win at a team based mode with no team to speak of. But with the new text chat and the old faithful voice chat you can at least yell your opinion at your mates in the way you prefer.Pro Tip: Bother up to 5 friends to buy this game to have them play with you. They may hate you for a while after that, but it’s not as bad as with Mario Party...And for the splatter/horror fans among you, there is the zombie mode, or the story zombie mode, where enemies are replaced with zombies while playing the singleplayer and so on.To finish my review, this game is actually worth the ~50€/$50 Acitivion demands. There is enough content for many hours of raging fun to have, even if you don’t buy the overpriced DLCs.

The gameplay mechanics are nice as well, especially the slide, something not seen in any CoD game before. The music track in the menu is also a HUGE bonus. Now we have acess to almost ALL of our favorite tracks in the series. However, I would say that unless you can get stuff like Chronicels or the Season Pass in a bundle, they’re simp,y not worth it. 50$ seems like an outrageous price for some extra content on a game that is already 60$. I would also like to point out the fact that only giving us 1 zombies map on a game that is 60$ is outrageous. Even BLACK OPS had more maps than that! I will admit i did get the Chronicels bundle, so Chronicels was free, but am still very disappointed that Treyarch would give us only 1, granted HUGE, zombies map in the base game.

Very well done.9Graphics: I said the same thing about Halo 5 but… This♥♥♥♥♥♥ is beautiful. And everything feels like it’s a possible future. Not too flashy but not too subtle either. However there is some texture pop-in as well as some somewhat bland textures, even on Ultra settings. But to counter that, there are a lot of elements that save it like the way they do lighting effects and how the HUD works.8Story: I was thrown for a loop, I got to have my Michael Bay moments, and I actually have enjoyed replaying it several times now. Zombies is incredible as well, however, Nightmares is done very lazily.8Audio: Why with the weapons sounding ♥♥♥♥♥♥? Aside from that, the atmosphere is incredible, explosions and music and everything aside from weapons are done incredibly. A few weapons stand out, but very few.7Multiplayer: This is the most fun I’ve had in a Call of Duty in a long time. A lot of changes and no 2 maps feel the same. And Arena is a great way to mix it up. People are ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but you can’t blame Treyarch for that. I only had one person call me a homosexual so far, and that’s a feat in and of itself. He didn’t know what to say when I corrected him and told him I was actually Bi though. So, there’s fun to be had, even with the trolls.9Replayability/Content: There’s so much to do here and, aside from nightmares, has incredible replay value.8Final Score:8.5/10I wanted to give this game a 9, but the lazy execution of Nightmares, broken Theater mode, and the fact that there are people out there with capable system that have problems knocks it down a little. Again, I’m not one of the people that had issues, so it didn’t affect my score that much.We MUST be in the future because a Halo and a Call of Duty came out in the same year and CoD the superior one. By MILES. And Halo is the one ♥♥♥♥ing itself up with microtransactions. I… Did I fall into a wormhole somewhere? Honestly, I want to retroactively knock Halo 5 down to a six or even a five. Because, I mean, compare the two and there isn’t even a question about it. Black Ops 3 is a far better game."

It is always good to see new things added to improve the experience that has been built upon since World at War. I haven't even touched the campain yet. The only bad thing I can see is the optimization of the game itself. I hear of some people who are able to run the game fine. It's not like that for me though. I know with my system, the game does not perform properly. The usage for my CPU (8-core AMD FX 8320) is everywhere. At points in game it ranges from 40%~100%. I have a friend that has a Pentium G3258 (2-core), and had less issues running the game at high settings. Treyarch still needs to work on optimization. Should you buy this? It all depends on what is in your computer. You should probably check the forums to see what pc parts are performing good, and which ones are not. You may want to wait a while to see if things get better."

,Not Recommended,311210,25452128,"Posted: 10 September, 2016",all,ShyGuyShayan,"This has to be the worst Call Of Duty I've played to date. Each section performs incredibly poorly in it's own special way, and that isn't even including the crashes and bugs I get playing on various computers. Instead of starting off with actual gameplay or story, Ill probably be pretty nitpicky, but when the developers charges 60 dollars for the product, It really should be criticized. The main menus Have no consistent tone or mood with a variety of either incredibly generic or incredibly odd musical choices. Previous Cods such as Modern Warfare would play a dark and gritty tone on the menu, letting you know what you were getting yourself into, or Black Ops II, with a somewhat upbeat, techno tune, telling you the distance which the series has gone and the new improvements and tech going into it. Black Ops III plays some of the most random and unfitting music i could think of, and although you can disable the random tracks playing, the original main menu music for it is an incredibly generic ""ominous"" tune. Ironically, the lack of tone or mood is highly reflective of the multiplayer and singleplayer, a lack of tone or mood. The game also has a side mode, Dead Ops Arcade, which has some enjoyable side modes, but is mostly just a distraction from the main game.CampaignThe campaign of Black Ops III starts off with the customization of your character, and although you can pick your gender and have some basic facial and hair options, it's a rather basic customization. It is my personal opinion that the voice actor of your character will most likely sound unfitting no matter what customization options you choose. The campaign starts off interesting, and the marketing is what was selling it as a deep psychological story detailing the consequences of cyber-augmentation, and how it can raise many social issues and threaten both the characters' minds and the world of the game (cough* cough* Deus Ex*). This would have been an incredibly interesting place to explore, but after the opening sequence, it really goes nowhere. Now in most Call Of Dutys, the shooting, obviously the main gameplay point, Is the funnest and most interesting. They really sucked the fun out of that with the endless droning sections of firing at robots, waiting for whatever they have in place of blood to dry off your face, and then continue to shoot. You would most likely be made to believe that with a jet pack, wall running, and a variety of other cyborg based techniques. THE GAME ACTIVELY DISCOURAGES YOU FROM USING THESE DURING PLAY! (at least on regular and above difficulties). If you attempt to fly out of cover to take down enemies from above, you will die. If you attempt to run up to a robot to do a mighty punch with your robotic hand, you will die. Well, Call Of Duties are also very well known for their set-piece over the top action moments. THIS GAME HAS NONE. This is most likely due to the fact it was designed for playing cooperatively with others, which the only real impact I can see making on the game is speed up the endless mobs and npcs. So there aren't any EXPLOSIONS and the gameplay is tedious, and the story isn't what i thought it would be, but maybe what story is there is good. Well it's not. In fact, half the time it doesnt make sense, or you wont care about it, to serve a meta-story hidden within the campaign which you probably won't discover or think about until the end of the game. Even then, that meta-story, 1. Leaves loose ends, 2. will most likely need a youtube video to understand, 3. WILL STILL BE NO MORE INTERESTING THAN THE CURRENT CAMPAIGN! did either of these stories of a conclusion? no, not really. In fact, one of these stories is COMPLETELY dependent on a comic book prequels story line to understand just *that much more. Theres also a zombie campaign... which is the same campaign recycled with an incessive voiceover and all mobs are replaced with zombies. Incredibly barebones in the singleplayer campaign department, which use to be all the rave of COD games.MultiplayerThe multiplayer of this games somewhat builds off that of Advanced Warfare, although being made by different developers. Where in Advanced Warfare's jetpacks made large thrusts and jumps rocketing you across the map, Black Ops III's jetpacks serves more as more of a speed power up or just an average ordinary (by jetpack standards) propulsion system. MP of COD games are always subjective, but I find them enjoyable. I especially found this one enjoyable due to it's movement system. After getting through the full map rotation and the first map pack, playing with a few different weapons, I realized how unbalanced the game is, and that maybe partially due to it's movement system compared to Advanced Warfare. I am incredibly awful at Call of Duty as a multiplayer shooter, and I was at the top of the leaderboard using only a melee weapon 6 out of 6 games compared to using actual projectile based weaponry always plummeting to the bottom. The maps are also feel incredibly drab and filler when you look at them. All uninspired 3 lanes to fight, formulaic, and bright colors to appeal to the massive young fanbase they've built over the years. maps give great contrast against players, which is design choice they've seen to keep since Black Ops II, (excluding Advanced Warfare, where you have actual difficulty picking up enemies against the background), and now players, with the ability to customize their character, the things they say, and the things they wield, are very colorful and vivid as well. This wouldn't be a problem... if the game didn't seem to TRY for a professional appearance in their game, but all that is lost at the end of the round where a seemingly dark and depressing song plays (for both teams) as the camera pans down onto the winner's circle, showing three brightly colored characters, with one of them saying, STILL TO THE BACKGROUND OF THE DARK MUSIC ""I am deth, destroyer of skrubs!"" At that point, you can see who their target audience really is for the multiplayer mod really is.ZombiesThe Zombies in Black Ops III is most likely what you will find to be the best part of this game, and probably one of the best of any Treyarch Call of Duty tite, but they manage to put a damper on this as well. Zombies doesn't really have much to improve or add to any of it's previous titles, excluding new maps, and easter eggs (I don't call that an actual storyline unlike other people), however, they found a very fun way to incorporate perks into the mode in the form of gumball machines. There are also fun little things depending on which maps you play on such as turning into a monster, giving you a completely new set of abilities. Here's the catch for all the goods of the mode: There is but one free map. ONE MAP. unlike in Black Ops II, where they would try to hide the fact that there is one map by offering you sections of the map to play with as well, here its just one map and one mode for it, plain and simple."

,Not Recommended,311210,19227836,"Posted: 22 November, 2015",all,r.al-ekri,"Let me start by saying that I had hope that Black Ops 3 would be the game that bring me back to this franchise. On the bright side, this game felt like it had great game mechanics, and that it has the potential to be a great game. I don't mind the specialists,  and I like the fact that this game follows the footsteps of BO2 in many aspects, such as the class customisation system and the maps-design concepts.But sadly, that's where the good points about BO3 end, at least for my situation. What really stops this game from being a great sequence,  in my opinion,  is its lack of optimisation and its poor pc port.Treyarch got many things right in the pc port, like having a decent amount of graphics settings, an fov slider,  key bindings,  etc. However,  two of the most important things were not done right; graphics optimisation and controls (the mouse specifically). Below is a more detailed review of these 2 vital things.First,  the graphics :If you have a pc with 980 ti sli, then the game would probably run and look decent,  as long as you keep the frame rate locked. However,  if you have a mid-range gpu, then you'll probably have a bad time! My laptop has a gtx 870m, which is obviously not the greatest card out there,  but it's no joke. For reference,  it can easily get a consistent 60fps in BF4 (high/ultra settings with AA enabled), but let me avoid comparing a CoD game with a BF game. So let's have BO2 as a reference.In BO2,  I can get 70-80fps on high/ultra in 1080p. But on BO3,  no matter how hard I try, there's no way to get a consistent 60fps from my laptop. I tried setting everything to low and reducing the rendering resolution,  but couldn't get 60fps,  despite the fact that with those settings the game looks absolutely horrible. In low settings,  unsurprisingly the game looks blurry (thanks to the reduced rendering resolution),  with 'staircasey' shadows and jagged edges being the only things that stick out (thanks to 'low' shadows,  and no or fx AA). I mean BO2 looks 100 times better than BO3 with those graphics settings. So why is the fps that low?!This leads us to:Second, mouse control :You can adjust mouse sensitivity, and even disable mouse acceleration, but you cannot disable or ignore the fact that mouse control/sensitivity is tied up to the framerate. So when you combine that with inconsistent framerate you get an unplayable game. - I don't know if imagining the mouse sensitivity being inconsistent or it is a side effect of low framerate.  Anyway,  it simply means that the game cannot be enjoyed,  unfortunately.To sum up, BO3 is a game that may have had the potential to bring back the name of CoD to the list of games that are accepted by the pc gaming community,  but unfortunately did not succeed in doing so. Because it repeated the mistake of the 2 previous CoD games, by not giving the pc port the optimisation it deserves.///////////////////////////////////////////Further notes, and replies to comments:Since steam is yet to add a reply function to comments, here are my comments about some of the comments on my review.1) First of all, I am running on 1080p, so don't tell me that you can get 50fps with a weaker GPU, when you're running on 720p.2) Second, I compared it to BF4 because, honestly, it looks better than BO3. Basically, my laptop can run BF4 in 1080p, 60 fps, with the game looking great. While when running BO3, 1080p, 40fps, the game doesn't look that good. In other words, I can get good graphics and performance with BF4, but I cannot get both - or even a balance of both - in BO3. Also are you trying to convince me that BO3 needs more CPU power than BF4, when clearly BF4 has bigger maps, more players, weather effects, actual projectiles, etc.If you're not convinced, compare BO3 benchmarks to Star Wars Battlefront benchmarks. Clearly, Battlefront performs and looks better!3) Third, this may seem like a personal problem, and you may say that I need a better PC, and you're probably right. However, this problem is a representation of how bad the PC port is. When a gtx 980 cannot get a consistent 60fps at all times you know that something is wrong! (In comparison Battlefront runs at 100+ on ultra 1080p, and BF4 runs at 90+ on ultra 1080p)"

76561198072202652,Recommended,311210,18939978,"Posted: 7 November, 2015",all,Satellite,"Call of Duty: Black Ops 3. Quite possible my favorite CoD to date. I’m not really into reviews but I’ve seen so many different reviews on the game. I’d figure I would put my own opinion about the game out there (oh boy. Putting your own opinion on the internet. Look out everyone!!). Anyway, personally I really enjoyed the game overall. I’ll start with the singleplayer.I feel that singleplayer is just thrown under the bus nowadays. The singleplayer for me was a blast! Sure people say, “Oh wow! That’s just a rip-off from Advanced Warfare!” I do agree but at the same time I really enjoyed the story. After finishing the singleplayer and going back to the first mission with all your cool new gear it makes you think, “Wow. I’ve been through hell and back. I’ve seen and done some crazy ****.” That to me is a great singleplayer campaign. Black Ops 3 totally did this for me. The characters were great and the voice acting was fantastic! I actually found myself getting attached to the team members. Plus the last mission really puts a spin on what a CoD campaign usually comprises of and I found it quite refreshing actually. It was a great mind bender. Now I will address some graphics problems. Just a quick note. I have a GTX 760 SC, an i7 4790K at 4 GHz, and 8 GB o’ RAM. Nothing fancy but hey it gets the job done. I did get a few FPS drops quite a bit but mostly around cut-scenes when the game was loading a new area. That didn’t bother me too much. But other than that I retained a nice 60 to 100 FPS even during intense scenes or firefights. I am sorry for those of you who are having FPS or stuttering issues, but I am positive that Treyarch will fix this. Just give them some time. Videogames nowadays are insane in the graphics department and can take a long time to tweak it all just right for a wide variety of different systems. Be patient and it’ll be worth it. Now with the graphics out of the way, on to multiplayer.I absolutely love the multiplayer! Having grown up on arena shooters like Unreal Tournament and Quake, this feels very familiar to me. Except there are no floating weapon, armor, and health pickups. The fast paced gameplay is definitely a rush and the new specialist system adds a welcome new layer to the multiplayer. You can even customize each specialist to your liking to make you stand out more on the battlefield. The new movement system is fantastic and easy to use. If you have played Titalfall before the wall running is the same. The weapons in the game are superb. I love all the weapons in the game. They just look like they mean business and can really dish out some heat. Along with the sound design, the weapons are just fantastic and fun to learn. Now graphics in the multiplayer are great. I get a solid 110 to 150 FPS with no drops or stutters. Smooth as butter baby. The multiplayer is fantastic with a great variety of weapons and specialists. It’ll definitely get you to come back and unlock some nice gear.Overall, Black Ops 3 is a fantastic addition to the CoD franchise, and probably the best minus some graphics issues, but hopefully they will be resolved quickly. Just be patient. Singleplayer is awesome and enjoyable and the multiplayer is a nice cherry on top of this kick-*** sundae.Black Ops 3 gets a 9/10 from me."

This CoD is nothing exceptional but some could agree (Myself included) that this game is better than some of the previous CoD games. Black Ops 3 had a pretty rough release for PC as the port was pretty bad. This is one the major reasons why this game has a Mixed review. Since the release, there has been several patches and from personal experience the game runs pretty good now.Misc.This game is set in the year 2065 and everything is advanced. Some people may like this setting and some may not. This is total personal preference. There are jetpacks and wall running in multiplayer. Overall this is a pretty standard join and play arcade shooter that you really don't need skill to enjoy the game. I don't play CoD as a whole anymore that much but I have played 66 hours and that's a lot for me. Believe it or not, this game isn't that dead. Every day I see upwards of 10,000 players and beyond playing. Of course there are some gamemodes that are absolutely dead but the most played and fun ones are always populated (Team Deathmatch, Domination, Search and Destroy, etc). At the top of each gamemode is a percentage of how many people are playing that specific gamemode. Overall, I would rate this game a 7.5/10."

What a surprise!This game is filled with hackers,cheaters,clan cowards,horrible netcode,lag compensation,an anti-pro player system that punishes you for getting too many kills and still no dedicated servers. What a surprise...I am not joking here. It is now officially a fact that Activision has designed their game to punish pro players that have a high KDR and perfect accuracy early on their combat record. If you also receive too many kills early in the game the ""netcode"" system triggers to secretly bog down your internet speed without showing it in the scoreboard and refuses to register your shots on time allowing the enemy to instantly fire back even though you had clearly fired first.This is based on a 40-60 ping average and I keep a close watch on the scoreboard every 30 seconds even after my death only to notice that the ping rates are all equally the same and are clearly showing false ping rates without ever showing what country or region they are from. There were even Russian,German,French and even Chinese players on public servers for some apparent reason.Because even if the enemy targets are staying perfectly still they somehow refuse to register your shots and blatantly punish you for it. This has already been proven time and time again that Activision/Treyarch are catering to the worst players in the game and completely erradicating the competitive scene and alienating the professional gamers that are simply too good at the game.The real value of this game is truly in fact only worth $15 meanwhile older COD titles are still being sold for $60+ seriously? This is probably the last COD title that will make it's final run and 2016 will officially declare the COD franchise officially dead.

Then get hazed""-Movement is fluidThe movement is pretty well done and quite different from previous games. AW-style dodging is gone, as is the enormous NASA-level boosts. As a result, BO3 does not have the same level of vertical combat as it's predecessor. BO3 instead has a double jump ability, the old sprint+crouch powerslide and most differently, the ability to stick to walls and run along them by holding spacebar. This provides some interesting opportunities for moving around on the map. Once you get good at timing your keystrokes, you can chain together different movements to move really quickly around the battlefield without breaking a sweat.You can also swim, and as most multiplayer maps have a bit of water it adds a fun new way to infiltrate a camped area.-Zombies is GOATWhat else to say? Zombies is always good but this game nails it. It's super challenging (and I mean SUPER), the map is huge and spectacular-looking and you'll never have so much fun wishing your idiot teammates were dead!It's also worth mentioning that Jeff Goldblum voices one of the characters.-Graphically, the game looks amazingThe graphics are great and oh my god there's actually colours now. It actually makes it a bit of a struggle to see players in multiplayer because the entire level isn't brown (MW2/3) or silver (AW).The Bad-The CampaignLet's play a game. Go outside, paint a side of your house. Do you think the paint will ever dry? If it does, we win. Congratulations, this paint game we are playing is an order of magnitude less predictable than BO3's campaign. The story is bad and turns into a very confused LSD-fuelled mess by the end, the maps are bad and are clearly set up to play as a group, but seriously who is playing the campaign anything other than solo? You will miss nothing by skipping the campaign all together, which Steam's global gameplay stats show that over 95% of players have done.-No dedicated servers for MultiplayerIt's 2015, almost 2016. Why do we still have this hybrid matchmaking garbage? Get ready for host migrations galore.The netcode is not great and if your host has anything less than a flawless connection everyone will warp around like they're in Starfleet. This is bad and Treyarch should feel bad.-Poor optimisation for anything less than top-tier GFX cardsAlthough the game runs flawlessly on my GTX980, many people have reported very severe issues on other cards that should, on paper, be more than enough to run the game fine. Every COD on day 1 is usually a mess but this one was particularly bad with loads of people not able to even open the game. Before your purchase, please check to see if you may be affected.The VerdictIf you are into multiplayer, I think it's well worth the purchase. If you were disappointed by AW, this will probably redeem the series for you. Treyarch have released some patches already, but there's still more work to be done to get this game running the way it should. Day 1 broken releases are not good enough.Wait for them to fix it, then come play some Zombies."

This game will most likely go down in COD history as a possibly debated best Call of Duty. I'd rank this COD to the level of COD2 and COD4. Yes, it's that good.

This means you can almost never win in an objective game mode since your teammates are always busy doing something else than the objective and feeding killstreaks to the enemy team at the same time. If you desire to win in a public match, FFA is the only option, which isn't very fun in the long run.Overdone view flinching is pretty annoying mechanic as well since it makes most of the guns kinda useless vs. high fire rate SMG's. Imagine playing CS:GO without kevlar all the time.All in all, I'd recommend this for ppl who exclusively play in party, mediocre players who just wanna have fast paced fun, or masochist solo-players who prefer SMGs in CoD.

Once a couple high ping players are in the game the game then simply stops responding well.The fake manipluation of hits and misses to help low rank players is all too obvious now. Shots will move far away from crosshairs and dots to get a non aimed kill. Same happens to make people miss.Zombies is what keeps these games afloat on pc they might as well take away most of the mp modes as no one plays them.

It runs terribly, regardless of settings, and I have plenty of machine to run it.For instance, when a multiplayer match starts, I have to wait until it stops lagging up.  This nearly always happens after about thirty seconds, or after I'm killed for standing around.  I can reliably know when enemies are around because the game starts lagging and the frame rate crashes.  Then I hear the sound effects of getting shot, then I'm watching a replay of my own death.  That, at least, is handy, since I didn't see it the first time.  After the latest patch, the game crashes after a few seconds into the multiplayer.  I also have to reboot my machine after each session, otherwise it'll run like garbage.  I can't play, log out, then come back and play or the system will bog down and be unplayable.It is really disappointing.  I preordered the game, and I think it'l lbe the last one I ever preorder.  I was never on the ""no preorder"" train.  This game changed that.  I won't preorder because I'm tired of getting unfinished games.

Multiple things I have wanted for years have finally been introduced.- You can text chat in the lobbies (at least the zombies lobby for sure).- You now have a full zombies experience with prestige levels and everything- Finally finally finally campaign, multiplayer, and zombies all feel like complete parts of the game. Each has their own experience system and they feel very polished.A smaller annoyance I've noticed is the inability to download others' paintjobs. Not sure if it isn't a feature yet or I just can't find the button.Pros:+ Framerates are great in comparison to AW, lots of options to tone it down for lower end systems+ Complete campaign and zombies experiences, even with just one zombie map for the base game+ Treyarch zombies+ Balanced kills, not as much lag melting like in AWCons:- Day one DLC... The Giant map should just come with the game... come on guys...- No lobby/server selections available, just matchmaking.

The weapon's attachments are hard to figure out by just glancing at them.  BO2 I could easily tell what each one did.  Care packages in BO2 could be placed out of bounds and using my Blackhat could claim the care package.  But with this game you must place the care packages in bounds which is riduculous.  Throwing out of bounds accomplished two things for me.  First, it prevented someone else from getting it most of the time.  Second, it prevented players from laying on the ground waiting on the care package to crush them so I can get booted for TK'ing.  With BO3 you must place them in bounds and of course there are those that wait to be crushed when it lands.  Also I could use Black Hat to hack into opponent's bombs, etc.   With this version you practically have to be on top of it to get it to work.  In BO2 each weapon had their own pros and cons, with BO3 I'm not seeing much of a difference between each weapon.  The particle scanner was a great attachment to have but fast forward to the future and BO3 doesn't even an attachment that is no where as sophisticated as that one.  Overall I wouldn't recommend the PC version of this game, I don't feel like spending money on the PS4 version as $60 was enough for a buggy game.  By the way, it still has issues with bugs.

So I wouldn't recommend this if you are buying this game for a full price. Even when it's 50 percent off, still it's not that much of a deal.

This was the first campain that i didn't care to finish.And not to mention it lost all my game saves and I had to start over, which in previous CODs wouldn't have bothered me one bit.I've played COD AW campain 100% like 5 times and loved it every time.Another thing that really gets me is the supply drops for weapons. If I pay $60 for a game I shouldn't have to spend more money to get all the weapons in the game. There should be a way to earn the weapons not luck of the draw or the weapon lottery. I don't mind supply drops but it should only have camos and accessories. I really hope COD considers this suggestion in future titles. This is hands down the worst thing about COD."

I must either run fullscreen (1366x768) with everything set to low or disabled in addition to a 50% Render Resolution which is not the most prettiest sight (again, BOII visuals exceed this graphical quality and the framerate by a notable amount; the American education system is more consistent than Black Ops III's performance), or play at Windowed (800x600) with everything set to low or disabled in addition with a Render Resolution of 100%.

Vsync makes your game looks better on your screen, but if you disable it and put max FPS to like 80-90, it should feel a lot quicker and more fun to play.*EDIT* The gun balance is a little bit off at the moment. Some guns are far superior to other and some are a bit broken (like the Drakon and Haymaker).

The multiplayer is similar to Black Ops 2, there is single and co-op campaign, nightmares mode, parkour, and the famous zombies mode.

I wouldn't say it's Pay 2 Win because the weapons are fairly equal but I wouldn't say its fair either because its completely by chance and you could spend $200 and not get a single weapon.

Whilst latency-driven multiplayer has been the norm for CoD games, consumers really do deserve better when compared to a superior multiplayer experience such as CS:GO. Good as a casual FPS on the side, but needs work on the multiplayer infrastructure before it can become the multiplayer mainstay of any serious FPS gamer."

Ill tell you for a fact that the microtransactions on this game dont make it pay to win. They're mostly cosmetic, and those which arent do NOT give you an advantage.If people don't like that the game doesn't look anything like an actual real life battlefield, that its all so colourful and vibrant. Then maybe they should have looked at the pictures and video's before they handed over their cash to a company they clearly hate for the sake of hating.If you're someone who enjoys call of duty games, regardless of their colour scheme or how unrealistic it is .... then you should enjoy this game. The jumping mechanics are very smooth, unlike AW, so don't be discouraged by that!Finally, if you only care about the zombies, they are really good in this game. The first 100 hours i had on this game were literally on the first zombie map. You can get the game and the season pass for like £55 - £60. So i suppose it depends if you're willing to spend that much money, purely on 6 zombie maps, one of which is a remake."

I requested a legitimate refund request to Steam (twice) and got a generic reply (twice) stating I had played over the 2 hours alloted time. 'Play' in this case being a very flexible word at the point that you and I would consider playing, Steam consider having the game running, actual playing time. Given that I was spending this 'play' time working around the various quirks that Black Ops 3 has been throwing up since release. It's been a long time since I used steam or yet, bought a game via this platform, I would emplore anyone not to buy this game. I have been 100% underwhelmed by the entire experience.I have however attempted to play a few multiplayer games and some of the campaign seeing that there is no chance of having my carefully spent, disposable income, back from this company. It takes far too long to get anywhere near actually playing with the constant connectivity issues, its completely demoralising and just leaves you looking for the exit menu.It might well run perfect for you, it might well be the game you've been waiting for and you're completely satisfied, i'm happy for you! But many of us are not, Steam have a duty to satisfy their customers, under both sales law and being generally fair, providing a product that you expect to work and gain an enjoyable experience from.I can confidently say I will not be recommending this game and I will not be spending a solitary penny with Steam or Treyarch at any point from here on."

No Biggie :-)   World at War is still my all time favorite and hopefully Treyarch will deliver another brilliant WWII COD some day. This futuristic stuff is getting kinda old , but it's still fun and better than Advanced Warfare. Nice work Treyarch. It is a very good game.

If treyarch bothers to fix most of the issues still out there, this game will turn out rather nice. At this moment, the game is mostly playable and even enjoyable some times.If you compare this game to bo2, this is way better. How ever, there are still problems. as example, in zombies mode if you open steam (in solo, having game paused ofc), do something like send a message and return to game, the game loses connection temporarily to your own game (?!) and informs you that your connection is interrupted.The game crashes a lot. In campain, in multiplayer and in zombies mode.Good thing that people sent a massive ♥♥♥♥♥torm to treyarch so that we got most of the problems fixed.

This game is awesome, best COD they have ever made. Split screen on one computer looks great and STILL plays at a constant 60fps.

,Recommended,311210,19274847,"Posted: 25 November, 2015",all,KiloPetraGames,"Now I know that this game has had a rocky start on PC with all of it's optimization issues, and I know that even though patches have been released, people are still dealing with these issues. Now, while this is by no means acceptable for a AAA title, I'm reviewing it based on it's content only. And I have to say, I am thoroughly enjoying this game so far. Here's why:Multiplayer:While there is wall running and there are still thruster packs, the ability to thrust in any direction has been removed, and the thrusters aren't nearly as effective for maneuvering as they were in AW. Their primary use here is to assist you in your wall running endeavors or aid you across wide chasms. The supply drops have also been changed to only provide cosmetic changes, as opposed to AW's gameplay changing items.The weapon customization is also the best that it has ever been due to the addition of the ""Paintshop"" and ""Gunsmith"" tools. Paintshop allows you to create custom camos, while Gunsmith allows you to create and save weapon variants.On top of that we have the nine specialists. Each armed with their own unique weapon and ability, these nine characters add new ways to play and think while on the battlefield. Even though their powers are limited, it is still some welcome variation.Zombies:By far my favorite part of this game so far is it's Zombies mode. The new xp progression system really adds to the replay value. There are the leaderboards which allow you to rub your highest rounds in all of your friends' faces, and weapon kits which allow you to customize the weapons that you buy off of the wall or obtain from the mystery box. To top it all off, we have Gobblegum, a new mini-perk like system that, well, dispenses various mini-perks. The maps themselves are great so far. The Giant stays true to Der Riese while still adding the Gobblegum machines and additional easter eggs, and I appreciate that Treyarch isn't leaving the original four characters behind, but instead making them a core part of this game.Shadows of Evil is another solid map, large in size, with three new enemies and four new characters to keep things fresh. The easter egg is as crazy as one would expect after having done some of them on previous zombies maps and it is incredibe the amount of detail put into the map overall. I must say also, that I really enjoy how both maps offer cutscenes, as opposed to those comic style intros done in BO2.Now for the good but not great but not bad,Campaign: While the campaign in CoD games has never been my thing, I thought that this one was alright. Difficult to understand maybe, and also, the voice acting for the male player doesn't always fit at times, but, it was alright. It was definitely made better by the fact that Treyarch brought back co-op play. However, the campaign itself isn't the most interesting and I wish that it would have connected to the previous BO characters more. I'm more looking forward to the bonus Nightmares campaign mode that should be available when I finish.Overall, a solid buy. If I had to recommend any CoD game, it would be this one, for sure, hands down. And with the upcoming dlc packs and future modding tools currently planned for 2016, there is a lot to look forward to."

,Recommended,311210,21842310,"Posted: 14 March, 2016",all,Burnt Chicken,"Great Game.  Campaign is highly detailed and has a great storyline to it, but most people don’t buy black ops for the campaign.  Zombies is great, but you can only play one map unless you get the DLC (yay money spending!) and you can customize a whole lot (gun skins, attachments, etc).  Gobblegum is also a new feature that allows you to spend as much money as you want (or play for a long time) to get cool perks.  The multiplayer gameplay is great just like black ops 2, and the new specialists add a whole new aspect to it.  Shotguns are overpowered and need to be nerfed and people that say they don’t obviously have never used one or gone up against one or just suck.  Sniping in this game feels a bit weirder but easy to get used to and includes another spammy semi-auto drakon.  Other than that, the weapons are balanced so players can choose guns that fit their playing style without having to choose a gun that makes them suck.  There are also supply drops like AW had (yay more money for skins) and you can spend money or just play a lot to be able to get them.  The supply drops also contain exclusive items like a crossbow and a freaking sword, but others are just aesthetics.  The graphics are great and the frames are seamless (really depends on your setup).  That being said, don’t buy this is you have a bad computer and terrible internet, because otherwise it’s really not Treyarch’s fault that you're unable to play."

BUUT there is something that kind disgusted me a bit. DLC weapons in the supply drops. I was hoping that this Call of Duty wouldn't have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t supply drop system like AW did. at one point, the supply drops were completely cosmetic and you'd could go for camos and different variant colours of your attachments, but after the first DLC, they started introducing guns you only could get if you did the whole supply drop stuff. Now people will probably tell me "" you don't need to pay for it, just use the cryptokeys!"" and yes, that is true, you don't need to spend a single dollar on the drop system and you can just spend your time playing the game to own it. but the drop rate of the DLC weapons are so low ( although I'm assuming when new ones get added to drop system, they up the drop rate for the older ones) that it'd be a better use of time just to purchase a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of cod points and just do it that way. and even so, that doesn't mean you'll get it right away. I can't give this game a thumbs down, only because it still is fun for me to play, with all the dlc weapons aside ( excluding the melee weapons. cause those are just cosmetics) this game still shines bright for me, and although this game will die because the new CoD will come out and everyone flock over there, I'll be content with black ops 3"

But if the game was working properly it would probably be one of the best COD in years. Eveything is better, the sound of the guns, the recoil the movement.

Twice now i have gotten to moderately high rounds (30+) and the game has crashed. In one instance, I was running from zombies on round 34 to buy Speed Cola on ""The Giant"". I purchased it and as soon as my character pulled the drink up, everything stopped. Nothing was happening, but the sound kept going. Nothing happened at all until i forced the game closed by ending the task. The second instance this occured was on round 25 when i purchased a Gobblegum, i noticed one was not coming out. Next thing i know the game says ""Connection Interrupted"". I'm playing in a solo game and i get connection interrupted to my own game. Seconds later, yet again, the game froze and the only way to fix it was to force the game closed. Although this has only occured twice, i now feel it pointless to even attempt to reach higher rounds because the game will crash and make all my efforts a waste of time. Until Treyarch releases a patch for this 1 of many bugs, i cannot recommened it to other people"

First off, DO NOT bother with this game at $59.99, just do not even think that. However, I recommend buying the Multiplayer Starter Pack, which includes a lot of the multiplayer and is 1/4 of the price, which can not be beat. I was very surprised to see I like this game, despite sucking at it worser than I do at CS: GO (Seriously my CS: GO K/D per comp is usually around 0.75 - 1.00) But in Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, it is like 0.1 (I know, I thought it would be easy, so I might use a controller). However, this does NOT affect my review in any way. Also, wall running is cool.If I had the full game, it would be around a 6.5/10 AT BEST.However, if you can buy the Multiplayer Starter Pack, I would say at least a 7.5/10 if not an 8.Yes, you can bash me all you want, but I kind of like this game. I once played Call of Duty Black Ops (Original) at a friend's house and hated it, but this one is okay."

Although there is no brancing story lines based off of your choices like in Black Ops II, leveling up does add to the replay value in the campaign.I've had no problem getting into multiplayer (except the DLC servers are under populated even for zombies sadly).  I just hope CoD will steer away from these futuristic jumping abilities because they really break from traditional CoD too much for me.My biggest gripe is why there are so many girl soldiers in this game.  In campaign your enemies are probably half and half girls and guys.  Not being sexist here but in reality, killing 'n stuff is more of the man's line of work than a woman's.  The game tries to paint some unrealistic politically correct picture of women doing jobs and stuff that's just downright unnatural for them to even want to chose, like going out guns blazing just to get turned into a pile of gore and gibs rather than taking non-combat (and smarter) roles like intelligence officer positions.But it's the classic fast and responsive gameplay tied with the amount of content you get with the base game (an improved Deap Ops arcade).All in all you should buy this game next time it goes on sale, get the dlc also because the maps are great!"

I think the new addition of the specialists are pretty solid and unique.EDIT: Now that I have put about 100 more hours in I wanted to revisit the review to help people out since I saw a lot of ""Mixed"" reviews.12/22/2015 I still really like the game, it's well optimized and it's great to jump into play for 1 round or stay for the day and rank up. One thing I can say as a con now is some lobbies are hard to get into. Anything that is not Team deathmatch core or hardcore or domination/hardpoint is getting tough to get into. I am guessing this will only get worse as time goes on. Also the implementation of lobbies matched by skill level means that connection quality takes a back seat roll. You can be in a game with someone who is your ""skill"" level and they can have 200 ping which is a real bummer. Overall I still think the game is really good worth picking up on sale if you like the COD Franchise."

Computer handles it find and the FPS in the game is consistant.I am not one for writing reviews and this is my first so that has to say something.This game was quite fun at the beginning. It is just like any other Call of Duty game out there. You have the Shotgun guys running around blasting people, Snipers camping randomly no scoping, SMGs like crazy, and those very few people that run with a knife. I don't mind that at all everyone is good at their own thing. My gun I leveled max was the VMP and the VESPER fun guns, I tried all areas though too. How this game was put together and you get to choose your special is pretty cool and everyone is different in some way. Out of all the COD's this is for sure up there on my list.There is always bad. I always played with my friend online. We would get into a good lobby of people that were around our skill level and when we did so it would randomly kick us out of the party and put us back on the start screen. Apparently they have not figured out how to team people up with their own skill level yet or their own player level. For example I personally am not a MLG pro and do not get 2.00 K/D or higher each match. I am roughly around 1.00 K/D so I should be matched with people around that K/D or if I am level 20 NO PRESTIEGE then I should be teamed up with people around the same level.Keypoints of what I didn't like about the game.- No Online Nuketown map? In TDM, KC, etc...- Hitting someone with the stock of your gun requires 2 hits 90% of the time- Hitmarkers on a target chest and higher sometimes can be 8 hitmarkers with the VESPER others can be 3 hitmarkers it is not consistant- The whole I'm around the corner and someone shoots me through the wall act is still there- Keybind interface was little confusing at first until I had to go into a match without bots to start pushing random buttons.So at the end of this I would not recomend this game. Yeah it is cool you can walk on walls they got rid of the stupid jetpacks from last COD game and maps are pretty solid. You can only play so much COD.Like I said I am no expert this is my opinion and I have played all the other Call of Duty's I have spent hours of play time before writing this review. Biggest upset is you can fight bots on Nuketown but I have never gotten Nuketown as a map in Kill Confirmed or TDM."

The campaign absolutely makes no sense what so ever, but i did enjoy what Treyarch did with the ""pre-mission"" room where you can customize your character & what not. But i found that the only thing that kept me to push forward to finish a mission. As for multiplayer, i feel Call of Duty changed so much that i just don't really like how it plays now. Some may like it, others may not. If you're really open to Call of Duty you would find a way to enjoy it & adapt to the new playstyle, but i am not one of those fans. & as for zombies, playing world at war & all of the black ops, world at war & black ops 1 still has the best zombies. As series continues on, developers tries to find a way to make the next fresh. Understandable, so i was open with zombies, kind of lost interest in it after black ops 2 & was hoping for black ops 3 to bring that love back, didn't really do it for me. What killed it the most is how difficult zombies is now. Running solo on zombies, i found myself surviving up to Round 7 which i thought was pretty crazy. Can't even hit the double digits solo. & i was able to get to Round 20+ solo on previous Call of Duty zombie games. I figured with multiplayer, i'd have a better chance of surviving & actually seeing what's past Round 7, but boy was i wrong. A couple matches online & the furthest i got each time is Round 4. It could just be the people i was getting matched up with, but to me it also seemed like zombie mode is just too difficult right now.Final Factor: i've been playing Call of Duty since COD3 so i couldn't help but buy Call of Duty even doe i have fallen off of the train at COD:BO1, but i still have played every single one up until COD3 & now, so i wasn't really surprised that i found the urge to buy it (i bought an MSI GE62 Apache Pro during the time COD came out so i wanted to try a FPS shooter on it which was this my choice.) Personally, i think this game isn't worth it at all. So i wouldn't recommend it, unless you just want a somewhat refreshing yet a rehash FPS shooter that  we crave now n' days."
,Recommended,311210,19042227,"Posted: 12 November, 2015",all,Creme,this game is a lot of fun i am new to cod but its still pretty cool. it runs kind of slow but my computer is only ok so idc about that.  My only complaint is that gunsmith/paintjob seems a little sloppily put together on pc.  gunsmith is very slow for me and i feel like it shouldnt be. paint job i cant even see what im making because it simply doesnt work. hopefully these problems can get fixed in some patch updates but otherwise no complaints.  I also suggest waiting till it goes on sail $60 is a little much for the quality of this game at least on pc

I mean tests have shown Extra Textures tend to use over 10 gigs of GPUmemory...WTF???I have an MSI GTX 960 4GB 128bit graphics card, and I should be able to max this game out with little to no issues. But that's not the case here. Luckily a little overclocking of my GPU seemed to have solved some of the problems...but not all. FPS will randomly drop at the most annoying times, and ruin the whole experience. So, the only real solution here...release an update to fix GPU memory usage. I mean what average GPU has 10 gigs of memory? None that catch the eyes of low to high end gamers...unreal. -_-Side note. This game is very fun when the settings are perfect, although you'll need to lower textures and shadows...still, the game is quite entertaining."

So it will have 100% under softcore and 100% under hardcore.Sometimes the numbers will be over 100%, but this is just to hide how few are playing the game.1) You cannot see what others have typed in chat if you miss it.2) I got matched against a premade party of 6, and none on my team was above lvl 55. (see screenshot).3) If I play with a friend I have to wait between 20sec to 120 sec, then we reque and sometimes get instant que. Playing solo, I get straight into a lobby, that isent nessesary playing.4) The mods with players softcore are :4.1 Team Deathmatch (76% players)4.2 Domination (14% players)4.3 Search & Destroy (10% players)5) Domination are full of premade teams, that will kick your♥♥♥♥♥ since you dont know what you are doing, or know the map well enough. How will you learn, well you can play a ♥♥♥♥♥on more, since there are quests, but even the 75 mission wins to be guarenteed a weapon will take you to the limit of lvl 55, unless you are insanely lucky.6) Don't expect to be able to use a sniper at first.You wont even get the aim in before you are dead.7) If you jump around, you will still hit where you are aiming.Expect player to shoot you in the head even if they are 5 meters above the ground flying through the air. (bonus: You get bonus xp for shooting them while they are in the air.)8) Mute everyone but party right away.The games are full of rage, but you cannot report a player unless you are back in the lobby.So if the player who told you to ""kill yourself and your family using a bomb"", you cannot report him, if he left during the loading screen or before you can click on him, selecct report, why and submit.9) Its like some players see you before you are there. I often die from someone I havent seen even while running towards them. When I see the deathcam, they normally walked right infront of me and shoot me normally.I have around 60-100 fps constantly and is on a 90Mbit/30Mbit with no download or upload going at all.My latency is normally 10-20.10) I do not suggest you pay ANYTHING for this game.Old review:I played 35 min in total.The problem I have is, that when there is a map change my router sets out and I loose the internet for 10 min.After the 3rd restart of the router, I uninstalled.THANK GOD I didnt buy this game !"

This is my real disgusting feeling right now. I was excited about that cod, I was looking for a BO2 like but in better, and now that I've played it I can really see that you're doing worst every single new generation. You put everytime new ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons and add the standard weapons when the game is dead, this is clearly bad honestly !Next you have the red dots from the scopes that are bugged the red dot don't appear for some people like me and a couple of my mates which is very uncomfortable, like you wanna use a scope but you can't otherwise you'll be way too much disadvantaged.Some specialist are easier to see through the map this is something problematic, because if you're a men specialist the enemy can see you easier than if you were female one.Plus some specialist abilities are easier to earn which is in my opinion not fair.I got too many unbalanced team on Arena, and wait too much to find a game which I'm gonna be against people rank 5 when I'm only rank 3 and in my team some of them are just level 3-20 and rank 1. So I got too loose too many times for unbalanced matchmaking.I didn't try the zombie mode beacause I am not a fan of zombie games at all and the campaign is good though.So to finish this I would put 4/10 for Multiplayer atm.Too many issues and bugs to be fixed.Too many unbalanced weapons and hip fire quality.Servers not optimised right now.Last update make the game crash.Scopes are bugged and sometimes you can't see the red dot.The Xp leveling is wayyyyy too much for what it gives, honestly you should reduce the amount of xp to level up.Anyway you should fixe a lot of things.Right now I do not recomend to buy the game, let's see what it takes after the patchs and all fixe issues."

It has its issues ( P06 and Drakon being somewhat OP ) but generally speaking, I have alot fun playing it.BUTI am someone who plays games like COD or Battlefield for MULTIPLAYER. So I bought this 15 euro multiplayer pack, I was quite happy with it, until I recently reached lvl 55.And no, its not about the lack of prestige ( which, imo, is somewhat stupid )its the fact that you CANNOT unlock all the multiplayer specialists, scorestreaks weapons, nades etc.. Its simply impossible as you can't get enough unlock tokens !. So now I have all the weapons ( except the lock on launcher ), 1/2 of the specialist abilities / weapons, 4 scorestreaks, and about 1/2 of the perks.and I know what some may say. that I should have read a bit more. but here you have a qoute from the store page ;The Call of Duty: Black Ops III Multiplayer Starter Pack allows you to experience the ranked Multiplayer game mode of Black Ops III. This is a Multiplayer-only version of Black Ops III that has limited content. See below for more detail.The Multiplayer Starter Pack gives you access to Public Ranked Multiplayer matches and features including Weapon Paint Shop, Gunsmith, Arena, Freerun, Theater, and the Black Market.For the complete Call of Duty: Black Ops III experience, you will need to upgrade to the full version of the game. Below is a list of features not available in the Multiplayer Starter Pack.Features NOT included in the Call of Duty: Black Ops III Multiplayer Starter Pack:Zombies game modeCampaign game modeAbility to play in Multiplayer custom gamesAbility to Prestige (your level will be capped at 55 in the Starter Pack)Access to mod tools or modded content (once released)Access to unranked server browser (once released)Ability to Fresh Start your profileThe ability to access Dead Ops Arcade II and Nightmares modeit DOES NOT say that you can't get all the items.don't get me wrong, its a good game, but this is just ridicoulusI recommend the game for poeple who also look forward to zombies and campaign, but If you only want only the multiplayer, be aware that the 15 euro package doesn't include all the multiplayer items."

Everybody seemed to be using the same Specialists with mostly the same guns. Guns that would basically 2 to 3 shot. Now I don't know whether or not this was because I hadn't played in a while or not. I even tried playing the console version but I was having the same issues. The microtransactions are god awful too. What ever happened to earning customization options? Don't get me wrong, I get stuff in TF2 but that is a free to play game and much better than COD at that. But to have to pay for the game and then pay to unlock stuff? Awesome sauce.

It sucks they don't have players list anymore showing how many players are online in total on whatever system you are using. Most of the times you will be in 3v3s or 4v4s even at the so called peak hours in the afternoon and for those late night gamers that love to play after like 12am forget it. You either dont find a lobby or like i said its a 3v3. all of the game modes say the same thing when you try to find a match 50 out of 50 found but in the end you cant join one. wtf? The only game modes they play on PC are TDM, Hardcore TDM, and now Fracture since releaseed. Wanna play any other game mode? good luck they all have 0% players playing on them meaning none are playing it. so no SnD or Capture the flag, or gun game. Everyone just loves the damn TDM or the new Fracture mode. Even when its a double exp event that is only for a certain game mode lets say domination there will only be like 15% of players on that game mode like wtf? don't you guys want the double exp? Everyone is on that TDM for life type♥♥♥♥♥♥lmao. But yea matches are hard to find and when you finally think you found one you go through one or two matches and then half of the lobby leaves and when you leave and try to find another lobby it sends you right back to the same one with the 3 people left in it. And zombies.... sigh zombies.. the game mode that half of the community claims is the only reason they get cod for (♥♥♥♥in liars you should all be smited down by zeus) NO ONE BARELY EVEN ♥♥♥♥IN PLAYS IT. you will find one lobby maybe with 2 more players and thats all you are getting eventually the one that is the host lags out and leaves you in host migrating for 5 minutes and then now its you and some random guy telling you random♥♥♥♥♥♥ Damn fam i just ate a sandwich♥♥♥♥♥♥was good..... ok...??? Then you die at round 11 and the last person leaves and good luck finding another match. Another problem is the graphics. The graphics look amazing as they should in a PC game and in these next gen AAA titles but wtf are the devs doing limiting the amount of settings you can change? like if i wanna blow up my cpu and gpu let me be. my settings were stuck on medium and low when i first started playing bo3 on PC and i had to do the whole config crap to get my settings to high or extreme. i put all settings on high and my game was still on a solid stable 60fps it would rarely drop and when it did the lowest was 58fps. Eventually the game starting glitching with the graphics on multiplayer while my settings were on high including the shadows and the lighting and all that good stuff the shadows would flicker and all the objects in the game would constantly switch between low res and high res in seconds either that or my game would litereally then go to 0fps no joke it would drop literally straight down to 0fps as soon as the match started wtf? i would take me like 3 minutes for the pause menu to even pop up so i can exit because it was going at 0-1fps. It was just a complete mess so now unfortunately i have to run the settings on high and some medium with the shadows off and lighting as well. All around it was just a complete cluster ♥♥♥♥. fortunately and unfortunately for me i got this game during steam sale so it was $30 and the only cod i had on my PC was ghost (why did i even buy ghost -.-) so i wanted to see how bo3 was but stupid ol me dont want to do some research to see if the game runs fine and if it has an trouble and if ANYONE EVEN PLAYS THE ♥♥♥♥IN GAME... for $14 more i could've bought the division which i've heard my fair share of♥♥♥♥♥♥about but still sounds more playable then ♥♥♥♥in bo3. And though i knew it was a high chance this would happen i came out being disappointed with this♥♥♥♥♥♥of a so called game. I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. hopefully if someone thinks of buying bo3 they see this review (if they are smart enough to even check the reviews before buying) and at least think twice. if you have money to throw away and just want another game added to the 999 collections of games you already have on steam go for it other than that dont even waste your money save it for someting better or buy something better period. It is most likely that you will run into the same graphical and lobby issues that i ran into and just spend 99% of the time when you actually find a multiplayer lobby telling the other players about how you regret buying the game and that for $14 more you could've got the division....... Don't be a me. And don't buy bo3...

I've been playing it ever since Mondern Warfare 1 came out (Call of Duty 4). When another game came out again, I couldn't help but get it myself. But soon, my love for this game was slaughtered within two seconds of playing it. First, PLEASE check if your computer has the right amount of RAM and GHz. I know that seem's like common knowledge to some people, but the feeling of getting a new game at times really blinds you from the obvious sometimes. I made the horrible mistake of buying it without realizing that my computer doesn't have the minimum amount of RAM or GHz which resulted me not being about to really enjoy a fast or simple running game without problems. But, back to the game. Second, I really didn't find this game exciting after the first two minutes. It's fun for about two seconds, but then you realize that everything is exactly the same as the other games. Now, that has been the argumemt for the other games, but this one once again falls under that category. The campain was alright from what I experienced, but most of these game usually have interesting campains. It made you want to know what happened next, but I've played so many of these games that even though I couldn't stop playing at times, I really didn't get that feel to play again. Multiplayer is like the other ones except with a few more add-ons here and there to make the player really want to play it anymore than the campain. It looks good for a moment, but once you jump into the gameplay, it feels like you're playing Advanced Warfare all over again, and for all the Call of Duty fans out there, we all know how trash Advanced Warfare was. Lastly, Zombies. Zombies was by far the only thing that I found really enjoyable. It was once again different then the past game in it's own ways, but I feel didn't have that push to make it to REALLY want me to play it as much as possible. With the gumball add-on, it was pretty fun, but as it went on, I felt that it'll get boring after about a week of playing. Now, I haven't had the game long enough to experience the full power this game may have, but from the little time that I did play it for, I looked at everything that I needed in order to make this review.

It has some ""kappa"" glitch moments of unrealisticity, but it's good. Multiplayer has a massive skill gap. Those who are level 50 have an extreme advantage over those who are starting out, and matchmaking is not skill OR level based, it just places you with people who have a similar NAT type. A level system has been concieved for both campaign and zombies. I don't know if they are going to release a map pack seperately, but for now, the only way you can get the ""giants"" zombie map and 4 extra multiplayer maps is by getting the season pass, which is pretty inconveinient for someone like me, who only buys zombie map DLC. Overall, this game is great. Not as good as advanced warfare or MW2, but it definitely stands up to withold the praise of Black ops 2 and 1. If you enjoyed the black ops series so far, you will surely love this game. This game is definitely not just ""another boring Call of Duty""."

,Recommended,311210,28964368,Posted: 2 January,all,SlamifiedBuddafied,"Note that I'm not big on multi-player for fps games, so this review will pertain primarily to the story and technical aspects of Black Ops 3. Though I will get around to updating about the zombie horde mode. That said.One belief I have is a game should be able to stand up on just it's single player alone. Black Ops 3 manages this, a bit wobbly in some spots, but stands solid for the most part. The story picks up some time after the events of Black Ops 2 and contains story content from the first two games that feel organic to the story, if the story made any real sense. The pieces all fit like a warped jigsaw puzzle, with funky exposition the player can feel lost for a majority of the story. Whether this is intentional or not, I leave to the subjective side of things. But otherwise the game continues the underlying narrative of how the mind is affected in warfare and the advantages and disadvantages of technologies role in both the public and private worlds. Though cliche, the story manages to not lose itself entirely to entire levels set in a surreal reality muddled with pseudo-science.On the technical side, the game performed quite well. With only two real hiccups which consist of an entirely random ctd and one game breaking glitch which in which the AI seemed to forget just what it was doing. Frame drops only occured in a small handful of areas which quickly stopped after seconds. However the user interface feels very much designed for console without being reworked for a mouse and keyboard setup which ruins the pacing throughout the game. The in combat menu to select your special abilites is designed for analog stick controllers, wasting precious seconds in the heat of combat to choose an ability. As for combat itself, this honestly feels like a game that just happens to have the Call of Duty IP attached to it.Overall, the single player campaign feels good. Not entirely worth a full price of $60, but good enough to catch on sale if multi-player isn't your bag and you want a good fairly solid shooter. I will say, the campaign feels like it should have a fair amount of replay value as Black Ops 3 also continues giving the player the ability to choose their loadouts before each mission, customize weapons and abilities as well.Pros:-Solid single player-Great graphics-Performs pretty good-Campaign feels lengthy-Proper difficulty curveCons:-Bad user interface, needs to be modified for PC mouse and keyboard-Massive file size for vanilla game-AI can feel janky at timesPC specs for comparison:MSI MS-7850Intel Core i5-4670k CPU @ 3.40GHz overclocked at 4.3GHz12299MB RAM (12GB RAM)EVGA Nvidia GeForce GTX 960 4GB ftw editionresolution @ 1920x1080Game was played at optimal preferences according to GeForce experience, in game settings of high"

I adored MW3, and only ever really played Zombies with my friends in Black Ops. I decided to check out BO3, as all of my friends had been being sort of negative about the futuristic style it was going for. Personally, I extremely enjoy this stylistic and mechanical choice, definitely over the previous 3 Call of Duty games, where they were always pretty much foreplaying the idea of futuristic gameplay and style, rather than going full force with the idea.DISCLAIMER: I have yet to play the campaign, so I can't put any input on that.The game plays fast and quick, and it seems that the developers have almost eliminated camping by making it more fast paced. The only problem with this is, the servers are never completely stable. They're not as bad as it was in the earlier versions, but try playing a game with a speedy style while your character lags in 3 different ditrections occasionally. It isn't a huge problem, hence OCCASIONALLY.Not much to say about the guns, as I cann't speak on their realism beacause 1: I only know a bare minimum about guns, and 2: none in game are real.The Specialist classes really add an amazing charm to this game. Wanna be a rocket powered explosive jumpy runny archer girl? Great! Wanna be a rough and tough sick♥♥♥♥♥cybernetic soldier with two gravity spikes? Great! Getting that specialist ability always makes you feel powerful until you're decimated by an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a melee weapon.The maps and graphics are absolutely fantastic. They look beautiful and they're all designed to fit the new parkour-ish fast and speedy mechanics implemented in the game, with surfaces to wallrun on around the map that for the most part, blend pretty well.The black market is nice. It gives you a sense of reward for winning and leveling throughout the multiplayer, giving you winning taunts, outfits, gun camos, and melee weapons.The game is also very well balanced. Levels of players is for the most part very insignificant, skill is all that mattersAll in all, I give this game a 9/10, definitely pick it up if you're looking for a fun, fast paced, shooter, similar to Titanfall."

If you dont like fast past shooters you shouldnt get this game. but if you do like fast paced shooters consider that it gets boring after a while and it kinda isnt that big if you ask me. But it is not a bad game at all.

Mostly the gameplay, but the graphics are amazing (I did expect it) you could also go on split screen (I didn't know pc does that). The only bad parts is trying to find a game, and you can't even play local multiplayer if your WiFi is down. But still, this is the best game ever!!!"

I have an avarage of 16-21 FPS while in campain, multiplayer, and sometimes 28-30 while in menu.2. The... Goddam... Loading... Takes... So... Long... I have a Samsung 512 GB EVO SSD, and this just takes forever.3. Freezes... Stutters? Every 10-20 Minutes or so campain freezes up and I have to restart. I need to *hope* that I can get to a loading point so I can continue before it crashes.Tip: DO NOT BUY THIS until the developers fix these bugs, and optimize this for Windows PC. (Yes, I know, they work hard, but they can at least pay attention to the rating of their latest game? C'mon, this has a mere ""Mixed"" in reviews.)"
