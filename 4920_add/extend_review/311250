In the first one there was really great atmosphere Amnesia style and dark but beautiful leels, here we got mazes of the same textures. Level architecture? Neverheard about it. Only the Hospital level looks ok (or maybe it's just shorter).As for the puzzles - here is how it works:""Here is the the puzzle. Like it? Good, cause we got an other same one, but a bit harder. Now go to the next part of the level  (that looks compleetly the same as the previous), and do some more of the same puzzles (now they're harder). Want some more of this cool puzzle? No? Want something different? Well, we don't give a f@#$, just go on with the same stuff over and over again!""First game that I finished just for the achievements. But it's not worth it."

Compare to Chapter 1 & 2, Chapter 3 was longer, chasers were more thoughtful, puzzles were harder, ambiance was deeper and more terrifying and control mechanics were absolutely amazing (That Flashback was just whow and sometimes really scary!).Only thing what was negative for me was that chasers such as The Wheeler and others.

I think developers got run out of ideas especially at the last part of the game because they have you pull a lever in a damn labyrinth while escaping a monster for 6-7 times. Boring as hell game if you ask me. Overall rating is positive because most of the people on steam don't really bother to finish a game. Prelude is more enjoyable and scary actually.

,Recommended,311250,12137429,"Posted: 18 September, 2014",all,TomsBrainHurts,"If you're a fan of atmospheric horror, you'll be a fan of this. If you were a fan of the first two chapters of Doorways, prepare to be surprised...sorta.From the offset it's got the same atmosphere, the same tension running throughout that made the first chapters stand out. Alongside this it has more traditional horror moments, putting this game somewhere between Chapter Two and Amnesia: Dark Descent in terms of play. Throw in some slightly more natural, less force-scripted, dialogue from Thomas Foster (that's YOU) and you're onto a winner.But, the game does take a turn for the worst in the puzzle repetition. While the first real set of puzzles are basically split in two and repeated, it's forgiveable as the experience is new for the game (you'll know what I mean when you play it) and tense throughout. It's a constant threat, or it feels like it. But the second puzzle feels more lax and easier - just repetition without the fearful tension to make it ignorable.Sadly this isn't just a one-off. I've not completely finished the story yet (couldn't find a certain something...), but what I assume to be the final puzzle/area is another case of repetition. I personally found this one the worst, as it had no tension and became a total grind of finding things and trying to figure out what to do with very little actual indication. I spent 50 minutes solid running around this bit pointlessly...without revealing too much, except puzzle initials, I hated the X-R bit.But still, it's a solid game and so far it stands up. The price is arguably a bit steep, I completely agree, but this game is still damn good. It's enjoyable and it has a good share of spooks and jumps. I do not regret my choice of buying this.If you want to look for yourself, here's a playthrough of the first part of the chapter with more following imminently.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE2W-4q1ot4"
,Not Recommended,311250,12133875,"Posted: 17 September, 2014",all,TheMettaur,"It's hard to justify even $7 for this.I really liked Chapter 1 & 2. Chapter 3 starts off just as strong! The scares were decent, the atmosphere was nice. This chapter features a lot of chase sequences, like the room with the giant statue in chapter 2. The first two with the first ""monster"" are really cool. The game has a very unique way of showing you help messages instead of using pop-up dialogue boxes, which is really cool. It adds to the stress of running away from the ""monster"". The story is pretty standard of this series, and the recap at the beginning of the chapter clears up some of the questions from the first 2. What confuses me, though, is in chapter 1 the main character barely remembers anything about what's going on, and now he seems to know exactly what is going on. Just weird, not a huge problem.The game changes with the second set of chases, however, and instead of being kind of fun and a little creepy, just becomes tedious. You are basically in a big semi-maze, and you have to collect a key from one part of the maze to get an item that you need in another part of the maze to get through the end of the maze. (I don't want to spoil the whole thing, that's why I'm being so vague.) Essentially, this boils down to running around boring cave hallways, finding a key, running back to open a door, going through that door, getting an item, running back to the place to use the item, just to go find a different key and do it again. It's monotonous, and the ""monster"" chasing you during this time could have been cool if you didn't spend so much time doing everything. It's so tedious that it stops being scary 5 minutes into this section.I didn't finish the chapter because of the section after that. The game just released, so I will go back to it eventually, but I'll explain why I didn't finish. The puzzle is either completely unfair and stupid, or I was missing something from the low brightness or my own stupidity. You have to arrange x-rays in a specific order, but where you find that order I have no clue. I ran back and forth through this part of the level about 10 times, not finding anything new. I had a frozen key to a door, but there was nothing to melt it out. There's a door that's locked with a numpad, but I didn't find a single clue to help open the door except for maybe some gibberish note on the wall that I couldn't make heads or tails of. Eventually, I got frustrated and ran around holding the frozen key, I jumped down a staircase, and one of the rooms was pitch black. I thought maybe I did something to trigger a change in the environment, so I stepped into the room. As I stepped in, I noticed some lights above me, and I looked up as I realized I was falling through the game. Somehow, the room had shifted upwards while the rest of the level stayed at the same position. This resulted in my continuous spawning underneath the level. I couldn't even access the menu to quit the game properly, because the menu appears sort of as part of the level I guess. I had to force quit the game.All-in-all, the game starts out as good as the rest of the series, then quickly descends into monotony and poorly designed puzzles. Maybe the ending of the chapter would redeem this, but I won't know anytime soon. I wouldn't be too mad if I had paid $3, but for $7 this was really disappointing."

Well, if you're gonna buy this game, you'd best get used to it.In Doorways: The Underworld you play the single most hysteria-prone supernatural-investigator-of-evil-people's-minds that you will ever meet.  Even after being chased down narrow, bendy, all-but-completely-dark tunnels by ♥♥♥♥ed-up dudes who look like they just stepped out of a Clive Barker novel, he's still prone to jump-scaring HIMSELF with the comparatively mild sight of a clean-picked skeleton or two.  Seriously, the guy is kinda crazy:  He talks to himself persistently, asking more silly questions than a six year-old child being raised in an Eastern European brothel, and they're all completely rhetorical because apart from the odd tortured, animalistic guy with a wheel in place of a pair of legs, HE'S ALL ALONE.I mean, if the first sign of madness is talking to oneself, then the second must surely be skulking about in unfeasibly dark places when you're as unsuited to scaring yourself as an incontinent schoolgirl with a rare heart condition.  This game's approach to scares brings two words to mind:  ""Heavy"" and ""handed"".  In roughly that order.  Having said that, it IS quite genuinely scary at times, almost in spite of itself.Proceedings get off to a particularly poor start, in any case, with a sub-Amnesia style bit which succeeds neither as ""stealth"" nor ""pursuit"", and yet BOTH are integral to getting through it.  It's a bit trial-and-error to say the least, and I for one nearly gave up on the game there and then, not even ten minutes in.  Fortunately things DO get better from there - at least until the heavily glitch-ridden finale - and there's actually quite a lot of really good stuff in this game if you stick with it.  I certainly wouldn't recommend it, however, to anyone just ""discovering"" the horror genre for the first time.  There's every chance you'll just throw in the towel with frustration, and never bother playing another horror game for as long as you live.The first Doorways game (Doorways: Prelude) somehow turned minimal mechanics and an almost total lack of regular, mobile ""enemies"" into a strangely compelling and satisfying experience.  Somehow, by adding more typical gaming mechanics, this second entry has done itself a bit of a disservice.  With a bit of luck I'll find that by the third and final game in the series, the devs have ironed things out a bit, and consolidated the best aspects of the first and second game into some kind of harmonious whole.  I have faith:  Saibot Studios are far from stoopid or untalented, they just need to give themselves a bit of a kick in the♥♥♥♥♥♥from time to time.Verdict:  8/10.(PS Nice little ""homages"" to Outlast and Penumbra in the sewer section.

Being someone who is terrified of horror but can't stop playing them it had a few good jump scares in there to get my heart racing. But that was about it.Pro's - Boss type characters that you have to avoid whilst working out puzzlesOccasional Jump ScaresAtmospheric music / soundsA lot easier to follow than the first two Doorways and more interesting, possibly due to the addition of more boss type characters.Con's - Puzzles get very repetitive very quickly. Currently given up playing it due to the very last maze where it took me over 30 hours to use flash back (slows time) which materialises the boss infront of you - in order to get to a timed switch only to realise I had to do the same thing AGAIN afterwards on a larger scale. No thanks!Wasted opportunity for further jump scares. When the head lamp flickers / under water.Over all enjoyed it greatly until the very end. Looking forward to the next installment in the series. All places played in this time felt very similar, dark dank caves. The hospital could of been expanded on greatly and used for great scare tactics. Also hoping for a larger range of puzzles, not the same ones repeated on bigger scales."

The final maze is awful, requiring you to jump in and out of 'Flasback' mode while avoiding a poorly animated monster. Overall the game is around 3 hours long but  could be extended if you have the willpower to collect all the collectables.This sucks Angela Merckel's balls.

Itis split into two parts;  Puzzles, which I found more to be of a scavengerquests that send you in endless repetitive loops, and the horror element,which is completely lacking in its ability to invoke psychologicalscariness.  It is more like a simulation of a coal miner than a horror game.If you are a child, or make it a point to avoid horror games, number one; whyare you playing this game, and two;  this game might scare you.

And again, the checkpoint system is very well-designed.I have just one big complaint - unlike the previous game, this one relies too much on chase scenes. I hate them in most horror games and this is no exception. They break the atmosphere and change the genre from puzzle adventure to frustrating trial&error racing game. And no, after dying and repeating the stage for the tenth time the monster is not scary at all. It's just stupid."

Puzzles are about the same: look for items and use them to open doors and such, but there's a new level to it. A sort of parallel reality by using a flashback amulet, looking both back in time and interacting with objects.Plus there are monsters. Monsters that chase you. And while that sounds like a lot of fun (it mostly is), in one particular case (the maze) it can become quite annoying because it requires a lot of trial and error and even some blind luck to get through the last part of that maze. Although, probably there was some more logic to it which I just didn't see.So, like Prelude, The Underworld is a disturbingly fun game."
76561198120403013,Not Recommended,311250,12257246,"Posted: 27 September, 2014",all,Vikenti Awaits,"Doorways Chapter 3 did manage to hold together the atmosphere, dark storyline, and the great voice-acting of the main character for awhile. However, the time trials area after the hospital interrupted the flow and became tedious very quickly. Time trials themselves are not necessarily bad, but for a game that relies on psychological horror, they need to be used only a few times at most, and making them too difficult and too overcomplicated only leads to frustrating the player and ruining the carefully crafted atmosphere that made Doorways popular.Case in point: After exiting the operating theater, you end up in mazelike corridors with a map and the flashback ability. You now have to do time trials where you need to hit the lever and run back to a doorway and go through before the timer runs out. Now, while it started out somewhat challenging, it wasn't too difficult or complicated. It worked with the atmosphere alright, and if it had stopped here, I'd be giving a more positive review.No, first, the map was purposefully made to be useless. You cannot run with the map in a readable position, so running to beat a seemingly endless stream of time trials meant running through confusing mazes on memory. But the big mistake here was trying to combine the Flashback ability with the time trials. Flashback slows down time, which is absolutely necessary for the later time trials. However, it also summons the monster, which appears very nearby, with the possibility of appearing on any side of the player, including right in front of them.So, how do you time it so the monster doesn't instantly kill you? Is it based on where you stand? Maybe, but when you've got a ridiculous time limit to meet, a map you can't use, and a constant need to keep reactivating flashback, beating the time limit and escaping the monster becomes pure luck. As I've already said, they threw way too many mechanics together at once in these trials, which only made the problem of the game having too many time trials already worse. The atmosphere that Doorways relies on was runined.I understand that challenge is important in a game, and the team tried to do something new and challenging with the time trials, but they don't fit with the atmosphere of the game, and honestly if the developers had given a skip button for the time trials, I would've gotten a greater feeling of satisfaction from clicking that button than I would've gotten from actually beating the time trials for real. That's the point where challenging becomes tedious, which doesn't belong in any game, Doorways especially.Anyway, the first few levels might make fans of the series happy, but once the time trials start, the game as a whole is likely going to turn into a disappointment for them."

However, this doesn't mean it wasn't without it's flaws.I was greeted on the first level with a taste of what the rest of the game would be like. Very dark corridoors (A lot of people complained about this, but it just makes the experience more intense IMO) and very creepy music. This level actually scared me the most out of the whole game, since the whole ambience really just didn't agree with me, so good job on that part. The first scare was well placed and was not random, since there were some little teasers beforehand. Then we come to the monster. This was the first time I was scared to even look at a monster in a game (apart from some amnesia stories), and even though the monster was on a path, I still crapped my pants when the camera swung round to greet my death.Anyway, onto the next level. The sewer theme was very atmospheric and dingy, although it didn't personally scare me as much. Music was still excellent and suited the environment well. The monster was also surprisingly scary, being difficult to outsmart yet easy to run away from. Then came the first problem of this game, which stuck throughout. The whole ""find something then attach"" idea really got dull after a while. This continued not so much to the third level, but especially to the fourth.Speaking of the third level, it was an abrupt change. A hospital. Something I found very creepy, and there were some well placed scares there too. Moreover, the gradual reveal of the story was very well paced and even though the story is a little generic, it suits the environments well.Sadly, although the confined and claustrophobic fourth level kept me on edge for a large portion, it was the repetitiveness that really let it down. Confusion led to frustration and this ruins the immersion. This was definitely the worst part of the game, which was sad since it had a lot of potential.Overall, this gets a solid 7.5, since the music and voice acting were bloody brilliant (same guy as alexander from TDD), the environments were well made and there were few bugs or breaking glitches (apart from  the odd control-slow-down key thing (??)). It's a game I would reccomend that you try, even if there are some issues."

The level design on the other hand is very linear and boring in most parts.AREA 1  CaveYou're in some kind of underground man made cave with lots of cells that people were kept in to experiement on they are mostly empty and when you walk into some of them you hear noises or have other effects happen that add to the atomsphere and the main character will say allot of things about the stuff going on around him at first and then as the game progresses he becomes the silent besides some letter reading but he doesn't even read all the letters either which is wierd.You walk down narrow hallways until you unlock the door releasing the monster who then will walk up and down the narrow hallways looking for you. The ""hide"" mechanic is kinda silly as in there are tiny alcoves in the walls that you just walk into and the monster magically won't see you oh and 1 table that you can hide behind.  You run past the monster to the next area and repeat the hiding to get past him once again until you get a chase scene of him behind you and you running in even more narrow hallways until you fall into a hole. End area.AREA 2  The sewerYou wake up in the hole and find yourself surrounded by skeletons and find a flashlight helmet to put on to let you see and travel until you reach a sewer area....yes a sewer area.  Here it starts getting tedious very very tedious.  I will explain in a very short manner what this area consists of.  You find keys and valves.  after you open a door or get a valve to add some water to a drainage pit so you can swim to find more keys and valves and do the same thing over and over again and instead of unlocking the monster as you did in the first area this one just magically shows up and walks around while you have drainage pipes to hid in like mario.  This formula happens twice find valves/keys dodge monster.  At the end you get chased by the monster again and run until you reach area 3.  See a pattern yet?AREA 3  The labThis area is probably my favorite it has allot of good atmosphere and I like the level design.  The lab has you find keys but then finally adds something to the mix to change up the game a little bit.  You find a stopwatch on a necklace chain that let's you go into the past of the Crazy neurosurgeon lady who is the main villain of this game.  it lasts for like 10-15 seconds I think and will change big to small parts of the level to let you into areas that would otherwise be innacessible.  I really liked this at first.....  A couple of puzzles later and you end up in the last area.AREA 4 The mazeI hate this area it is so tedious and all scare facter goes away after dying repeatedly and turns into frustration very quickly.  The objective is you find a switch you flick it you run to the open door before the timer runs out and you repeat this 4 times!  The first 2 times is easy and they give you plenty of time.  After awhile you find out you have to use the stopwatch to go into her memories to slow time down enough to make it to the combination of switches in time.  neat mechanic right?  The problem is this area is a maze and the hallways are narrow and when you flick the stopwatch the monster neurosurgeon lady shows up to chase you only while the stopwatch is active scary right?  No annoying as hell!It is creepy at first but she almost always appears right in front of you even though when you die it says she won't and most of the switches are at dead ends so unless you time it right or get lucky she will kill you after you hit the switch.  In the last area of the maze you get a map that fills out as you explore this area but still never deviates from find the switch to the other switch and flick them before time runs out to open a huge sliding wall door only this time you have to use the stopwatch to get to the other switches in time and after awhile the stopwatch gets stuck and you never leave her past.Then at the end she takes the watch off of you crushes it and chases you again in narrow hallways where you have to flick switches while running from her and hit buttons to open doors.   At the end of the chase scene you hit 2 buttons the monster gets smashed and you walk through some fire area to a elevator where the screen turns black and says YOU HAVE COMPLETED CHAPTER 3 CONGRATULATIONS!  That's it.While being longer than the first 2 chapters this game is extremely repetitive and hardly deviates from what makes it repetitive  it turns from creepy to frustratingly annoying most of the time saibot did poorly in my opinion and it should not have taken this long to get a 3 hour copy paste level set-up with very minor differences in it out.  I hope they read this and make chapter 4 worth actually getting because they have a good idea here but can't seem to get it right.  I give this expansion to the game 4/10."

What got my blood pressure up was the fact that I cannot finish the game.     The last level--the maze-  I understood what I had to do.   It was doing it--the last part just got me so frustrated I just decided it wasen't worth the aggravation.When I am given seconds to attempt to run from one spot to another with some stupid map that eitherblocks your view or you cannot read because it is out of view and you know you have ran out of time,  well,why bother when your near the end of the game anyway.After awhile the ""scary Person""  is not scary,  just annoying,  and you want a weapon that will bludgeon her andwill help vent your frustration."

As the first in the series, the puzzles are like easy enough for my dog to figure out.  Unlike the 1st, the last level is unbelievably frustrating near the end.  As usual, the puzzle and exactly what you need to do is painfully obvious.  The most difficult part of the game is not rage quitting.  The last part you have to almost literally be down to the last pixel in where you stand to activate your ""flashback"" so some creature chick, Hillary Clinton?, appears and then chases you.  You have to time it perfectly and be in the perfect spot since you have to go to a dead end to...pull a lever!  Then the flashback has to end JUST before she kills you.  Then of course the clock is ticking for you to...pull another lever!  The trial and error was brutal.  I was literally to the last attempt before I rage quit.  These games have a lot of potential if they worked a bit more on the looping soundtrack by making it longer.  Making the puzzles a bit more complex without some petty perfect timing in the perfect place nonsense.  Then of course take out the lame jump scares.  Lastly they need to make these games longer if they plan on charging anymore than $5 for them.  Hopefully the 3rd in the series is better because I think in the bundle that came to 10$..."

,Not Recommended,311250,12187996,"Posted: 22 September, 2014",all,Krusti clawn,"This review may contain spoilers.Positives:- Scary moments- Intresting story- Creative featuresNegatives:- The story line is too obvious- Repetitive gameplay- Bad graphics- Bad monsters (read further down)- ShortI thought the first two chapters were decent. I didn't love them, but it was a pretty nice experience. I saw the pictures and trailers and though that this chapter looked even better and was excited to finally see some real monsters in the game. But in the end, it feels like the developers took a step back.Story:I liked the story. Classic psycopat, torturing victims, doing experiments and so on. I like that kind of story, and in all honestly, it was pretty well written with a great choice of voice actor, but the story was kind of there already.I read the first 3 notes and I knew pretty much exactly what the story was going to be about. I have played games with such complex stories, so, even after playing them twice, I still don't know everything about the game. It took me around ten minutes to figure out what this game is about. It's way too obvious what the antagonist is up to and what you should expect ahead.Level design:Honestly, the design is bad. The graphics looks like Penumbra. Don't get me wrong, Penumbra is a great game, but I expect something better at the year of 2014.It looks like you put very little effort to the levels, because every map look pretty much the same. The sewer map for instance. It looks like you made a tunnel and then copied it over and over again. Not only does it look like you are guys are lazy, but it makes it confusing. I probably ran through the same tunnels three times or so because I didn't know if I had been there already or not.Gameplay:I like the animations when you use and pick up items. You don't just select an item, use it on something and it disappears out of nowhere, it actually looks like you really use the item, which gives it a more realistic feeling.Although, the game in general is so repetitive. First map - find keys. Second map - find keys and valves. Second part of the second map - find more keys and valves. Third map - find a key and Xray pictures.It lacks creativity basically. Except the amulet. That was a nice feature.Monsters:I feel like the first monster really have the upper hand. It both look and sound creepy, but it was so hard to hide from him. I was crawling behind him and he suddenly turned around and killed me instantly, even though the character made no sounds at all while crawling and I was at a pretty long distance.Even when I was hiding at a different hallway, waiting for him to leave, and it should have been impossible for him to notice me because he wasn't looking at my direction and I didn't move at all, guess what, he ""saw me"" and killed me instantly again.You have a very, very low chance to survive if he notice you because he is super fast and kills you in one hit.I escaped from him after around ten minutes though and never saw him again. You made a monster, only to use him in one encounter you can get away from in a couple of minutes if you are brave enough. Good job guys!The second monster was way better gameplay wise because at least I had a chance to get away from him, but he didn't look near as scary as the first one. He looked like a mutated Hulk with a metal leg. It wasn't scary at all actually, just silly.Third and final monster did at least look pretty creepy, but once again, low chance of survival. Use the amulant at the wrong time, instant death.Conclusion:Doorways: The Underworld is a great game if you wish to try out something scary, but I recommend you to stay away from it if you are looking for a deep story and/or unique gameplay.I liked the atmopshere, story and features, but my experience with it was in overall bad.And seriously, you want us to pay for each chapter? Greedy much?5/10 - Average, not recommended to buy."

This is a pretty good game until you get very close to the end, where it's so frustratingly repetitive that I abandoned it.  But everything before that?  Decent atmosphere, spooky at times (especially early on), but more generic than chapters 1 and 2.  The first two chapters are a more unique, subtle type of horror, but this one clearly shifted its gameplay closer to Amnesia/Penumbra style, but it still retains some of its originality.  Vaguely reminds me of Manhunter."

I'm not sure why i like these games, but the 3rd chapter in the Doorway story has improved upon the first game, while also screwin a cupple things up.The Pros:-  Same good narrative and voice acting: These games have a very episodic feel, like im watching some late night early 90's mystery/horror/scfi show like x-files/tales from the crypt or something of that nature. No matter how low budget these games are they have that charm to them- This game is significantly scarier than the first one: Oh Yes, They're are monsters, and depending how much time you spend with them, they can be pretty scary off the bat, while the first game only had enemies that acted as enviromental traps, this game has monsters that roam areas. While not entirel original, its still fun, and the last monster has an interesting way of coming up and terrorizing you- Sound: A Solid sound design. Good ambient effects, works well with headphones,The Cons:- Presentation: I'm not sure if this is just me but this game doesn't feel as polished as the first one. The game is not broken or unplayable by any means, it's just certain parts seem a litle rough around the edges.- Repetitive Puzzles - This annoyed me significally, where they spread out 2 seperate types of puzzles by pretty much making an identical carbon copy of both in different areas. It kind of made things less scary, especally since each part had the same monster, became easy to predict.- The ending was kind of abrupt. I thought it ended well in the first game with the climax and a little after thought. in this one it felt rushed.Personally I like the concept of Doorways and I will certainly be playing the next chapter."
