I use an Intel Core 2 Quad Q9550, 8GB of DDR2 RAM, with a Radeon HD5870. It runs with a mix of high and medium settings and it manages to stay at very smooth framerate of at least 40fps and up.

Why do you continue to scroll through them while your memory betrays you? You enjoy reading reviews, that's why.""I'll get straight to the point. This review's main goal is to address common misconceptions.Amount of Content:Ground Zeroes offers 7 missions: one main story, four side missions with different objectives, two extra side missions that are aimed at the fans of the series. Each mission has two difficulty settings (hard unlocks after beating normal), secret collectibles/objectives and unlockable trials (challenges). Throughout all missions you'll be dealing with only one location: Camp Omega, which is a fairly large facility. Each mission has it's own time of day.If you like playing your games at a medium pace and you never had contact with this game before then you'll be able to complete all 7 missions in 5-10 hours+. If you're willing to spend time to get 100% completion, get most of the rewards and read/listen to the story then you might end up with 15-20 hours+ on you. However, it's possible to speedrun all 7 mission in ~1 hour (that is, if you know what you're doing). If you buy Phantom Pain alone then you won't be able to access Camp Omega and it's missions through it as they're avilable only for those that purchased Ground Zeroes (meaning this is a prologue and not a demo). However, if you purchased both then you'll be able to visit Camp Omega with all your Phantom Pain upgrades, not to mention special bonuses.Performance & Settings:Runs on systems that are below minimum system requirements. Well optimized, but could've had even higher level of detail / drawing distance settings (some visible popup of small items). One common complaint are increased amounts of depth of field (blur / out of focus). It's easily ""fixed"" by decreasing Screen Filtering to High.Fully playable on K&M but could've had a slightly better control scheme (currently there's some sensitivty bug when aiming while zoomed). Minority of people experiences some compatibility issues some of which were caused by bad system configurations, but some are legit and there most likely will be a compatibility fixing patch.Metal Gear is a legendary franchise, Ground Zeroes gives you a tiny bite of Phantom Pain and from here it only gets better. If you're into stealth, ""tactical espionage action"", shooters or just good stories then you should certainly get it. The game gives you freedom to choose your own path and your own tactics / playing style, be it complete stealth no kill or running around shooting rockets and riding tanks."

,Recommended,311340,13797624,"Posted: 2 January, 2015",all,Tyler Gently,"It's short, no denying that. As I'm sure you've heard, the game is incredibly short. I knew this going in, and intentionally took my time. I was still able to finish it in an hour and ten minutes.Granted, the ""story"" is supplemented by several side missions (only playable after you finish the story) which range from meeting contacts to rescuing agents, finding intel, destroying facilities, or even assassinating different people (whom you must identify from pictures). All in all, it's several hours of gameplay.As for the gameplay itself? Honestly, it's pretty fantastic. Combat is tight, stealth is difficult and rewarding, from what I've seen, the AI is very smart and pretty perceptive, none of that ""hide three feet from their face"" you get from ""stealth"" in games like Skyrim. If you aren't hidden, they'll spot you from a hundred yards, and they'll investigate. Very good AI.The game boasts an ""open world"", but the open world is a single prison camp on Cuba. The camp is not especially large, and some of the features new to  the Metal Gear franchise are pretty useless as a result, like Snake's new ability to drive vehicles (that said, I did enjoy the AI's use of vehicles in patrols and transportation).The screenshots look pretty fantastic, right? You'd think that there's no way you could get your rig to do something like that. I'll admit, my computer is pretty decent in regards to gaming, but it often lags behind on newer titles. This game, however? It runs amazingly. Seriously, this might be the best optimized game engine I have ever played. I was getting those graphics at high FPS. Only in a handful of occasions did the game ever stutter, and these events were brief and far between.For the story quality, there honestly isn't that much. The game is literally, with no exaggeration here, ""Go here, get this guy, bring him to the chopper. Go there, get that girl, bring her to the chopper. Cutsene. Credits."" At best, it's a demo/prologue of Phantom Pain. At worst, it's an epilogue to Peace Walker. The game takes place right after the end of Peace Walker, and centers around the rescues from a Cuban base of two characters from Peace Walker. The game does include some backstory which you can view, which is nice, but people who played PW (such as myself) will probably appreciate the characters more, and feel the impact of certain events near the end much more.Now, the final verdict: The game is fantastic, and that only makes it that much more painful that there's so little to enjoy. I'm going to give it a different rating based on the price. If it's on sale for five bucks, I'd say it's a must-buy. If it's on sale for ten, I'd give it some thought. For twenty? A flat-out no, unless you're an absolute die-hard fan. I'm giving it a thumbs up for in general, as it is a good game, but if you aren't able to get it on sale, I'd suggest you just go ahead and skip this one; buy the Phantom Pain when the game is worth the price. Watch a playthrough on Youtube. It'll only take an hour.EDIT: Fixed some weirdly worded sentences."

Running it on the highest settings at 60 frames. Its looks fantastic and its graphically superb.It has full Keyboard+Mouse support or the 360 gamepad.The sound quality is amazing, same with the voice acting. Kiefer Sutherland does a great job voice acting Snake. It was a little shocking at first because i'm so used to the voice of David Hayter, but i got along just fine and i believe Sutherland will live to everyone's expectation in this game and The Phantom Pain.The game might be a little bit short but the story is pretty good (If you played Peace Walker, you will understand). Besides, the pricing is perfect and the game offers some replay value. This is just a little slice of what we are going to get in The Phantom Pain and i cannot wait for it.I'm thankful for finally being able to play this on PC the way it was meant to be played. 9 months ago, i bought a PS4 for this game and i was about to order the game for the console, i'm so glad i've waited for the PC version.Hats off to one of the greatest developers of all time, Hideo Kojima.

,Recommended,311340,13912403,"Posted: 9 January, 2015",all,Chotato,"The enemy AI in this game is absolutely why I continue to play, and replay this game at least once a week.When I play stealth games, I'm not interested in learning patrol patterns and sneaking around them with no problem. What I'm really interested in is an AI system that has context and situational awareness. This game has both. The main mission takes place during a hurricane, naturally this gives the AI reduced sight/hearing and what have you. I'll give a very brief example of the AI's contextual awareness.After getting spotted and going into the, as I understand it, new slow motion 'second chance' system where you can take out the enemy that spotted you and go unnoticed, I shot the unlucky guard in the face with a suppressed weapon. Minutes later I intercept a radio transmission from the control tower the the guard I just took out. From what I can tell each guard is assigned a number 'Delta 1, Delta 2' and so on. Since the guard they were radioing was out of commision, they sent another guard to check on him. Soon they found the body.In most stealth games you'd expect them to see the body and then either that guard doesn't tell anybody and searches for you, or other guards that have no idea what happened all know you're there. This game was different.He assessed the situation and radioed back to the tower that he died of a gunshot wound and since nobody reported hearing one, concluded that the intruder responsible must be using a suppressed weapon. After hearing this information, the entire base went on alert with sirens going off all over the place and backup arriving just a minute later.Most stealth games these days have me feeling pretty confident that I can hide around a corner and I won't get spotted. This is not the case for Ground Zeroes. If you want to get 20 feet inside this base without getting seen or heard, you need to find a vantage point and survey the area for a good 5 minutes, tagging enemies, trucks, watch towers ect.This is as true to life as any stealth game I've played has come for me in the past 20 years. If you like MGS, this is worth checking out to get a taste of the Phantom Pain. If you like stealth games, there's enough here to keep you busy without knowing the setting or story.This is just an example of how advanced this AI is for this type of open world setting. I'm a new fan of the MGS games and other than the Metal Gear Acid 'board games' for the PSP is my first time playing any MGS game. I can already say that without a doubt, I'm buying Phantom Pain when it releases and for stealth lovers, this is a lovely distraction from the wait until Phantom Pain comes out."

Whereas TPP is big, bloated and bogged down by superfluous gameplay elements (e.g., base management), GZ is tightly focused. Instead of trying to do many things, it only does a few things and does them well. Everything, from the relative simplicity of the gameplay to the open but not ""open world"" environment, adds to the illusion of being a stealth action hero.When I play GZ, I'm not thinking about checklists, base-building requirements or how long it takes to unlock the absurdly powerful weapon no one really needs by the time they get it (all of which carry an uncanny and unpleasant resemblance to microtransaction-based mobile gaming -- but I digress). I'm thinking about how cool it is to sneak through a base of Marines in the middle of a rainstorm. What's more, I don't feel the need to Fulton extract everything in sight. I can simply focus on the action.Yes, it's only a prologue. But GZ is a smarter, tighter game. That's all there is to it."

From linear gameplay to open world style and it works very well.-No Soliton Radar, which makes sneaking very intense and cool.-New UI etc.-Movement is very smooth.-Amazing graphics and weather effects thanks to Fox Engine.-New voice for Snake, Kiefer Sutherland. Some dislike the change, but I love Kiefer's voice too.-Bonus missions and lots of replayability, challenges etc.CONS-Story mission is pretty short, but on the first time it can take a while.-No traditional codec calls, as in previous MGS games.

After even Raiden making its debut on PC gaming this year, finally the main series is back. But this time is Big Boss himself, arriving for the first time on PC. But is Ground Zeroes worth? It’s almost certainly that you saw people on internet calling it a “demo” for The Phantom Pain, the main “V” game arriving next year (which will be available for PC too). I had played GZ for 30 hours on PS3 and 100% complete(and you can see I’m a big of the series by looking at my steam profile too) it so I prepared this review! Ground Zeroes is the Prologue for TPP, presenting the new features on the series, like the open-world stealth, usable vehicles and new HUD. GZ have beautiful graphics using the new Fox Engine from KJP, it’s really amazing, and for sure the illumination is one of the most impressive ever seen. The gameplay is smoother than the other MGS games, adding vehicles (In GZ you can use jeeps, trucks, APCs and can call for Heli support). You have now your IDroid which you can use to see the in-game map and to use other features like mission info, walkman, etc. The soundtrack is epic, and the cutscenes like in other MGS games are amazing, the ending is a good link for The Phantom Pain, the PC port is amazing, probably one of the best ports of the year, if not the best; and in Camp Omega you have all-new features like binoculars to mark enemies, destructible scenario in some structures and some collectibles. The only bad thing about the game is the short story. Depending in how you play it will take 1-2 hours to complete the main mission, so if you only play main missions on games don’t buy GZ. But if you like to explore there are good 6-8 hours to complete all missions and 20 hours to 100% the game (which is a good time). The game have almost no bugs and now on PC there is support for beatiful 4K and modding! Kiefer Surtherland voice acting is actually good too. I think that he is better to play Big Boss as the game is darker, so, after all, it’s a good voice acting(of course probably David Hayter maybe would be better).As this is a “prologue” there is some features from the previous games that are not included, besides this adds more things. There is no Cardboard Box, knocking on walls, funny items, knife, etc. But all of those we’ll be included in TPP. Camp Omega feels alive too! Soldiers are always doing something, like talking to each others about recent facts and eventually even tips for the objective. It's a cool system. And there are pretty animations. New animations and mechanics includes cool CQC moves, refined interrogation, and new and realistic crawling animations, where snake actually moves to where you are pointing the gun. The AI is one of the most impressive in gaming, the guards working and investigating, mostly on hard difficulty to have a real stealth experience (this series being one of the pioneer in good AI) And if you wanna catch up with the story for the other games, there is a section on menu for that! There is also a few collectibles to search in Camp Omega, including nine XOF patchs, that will unlock two extra ops (besides the four side ops). These Extra Ops are all for fun. It's a good tribute to MGS1 in Dejà-Vú mission, with a lot of challenges to complete, like finding and cleaning all MGS logos, and a lot of easter eggs, like playing with Solid Snake model from MGS1 and even Gray Fox model! And the other is Jamais-Vu, which adds pretty action to the game as you contro the cyborg Raiden, which some little changes to the mechanics, like running, and Raiden is a Cyborg. The four Side Ops are really cool too. They ar eunique, besides the fact that all of them pays on Camp Omega. There is an aciton-packed mission to destroy Anti-Air Emplacements, two cool stealth based missions where yoiu have some targets and a unique mission that you fire from the chopper while defending and then rescuing an agent of yours. The cool thing is that the agent is actually....MR. KOJIMA!. All of those missions have highly replayability and there is a lot of things to find, easter eggs and ways to complete them. There is too another collectibles, like cassete tapes, and special weapons by getting some ranks in each mission. There are cool songs from previous games that can be unlocked and played in a mission, or even custom songs from your computer! There is now doubt that the game quality itself is unquestionable, but what about the price-benefit? Ground Zeroes price is actually good for those who are gonna explore the game and play all the missions, but if you are just gonna beat the main mission, it’s not recommended. But after all, Ground Zeroes is an amazing game, with new mechanics that prepares us for the amazing The Phantom Pain next year. Besides story being too short, is a good taste for MGS on PC.+Amazing Graphics with all-new Fox Engine+Smooth Gameplay+Epic Soundtrack (including known songs from the series)+Open-World+Variety and lots of weapons and equipment+A lot of background story+Good PC port+Binoculars, vehicles a lot of new animations and Destructible scenarios+Refined Stealth+Good missions besides being only a few+Kiefer made a good work at voice-acting+Good shooting+Control support if you don’t like to play on keyboard and mouse+Snake on PC!+Great ending+Impressive AI+Idroid is very versatile and useful+Some cool easter eggs+Kojima himself in-game!-Short story-Little overpriced for those who pays only for story-Camp Omega is quite small-Lack of some features (Box, Knocking…)Ground Zeroes, besides being small, is an amazing Epilogue for Peace Walker and a good Prologue for The Phantom Pain with all-new features and good PC port8,5/10Buy the game if you are the kind of person who likes to explore and complete everything on a game, this game will give you a lot of diversion. If you only play for story, do not buy it, it’s excellent but it’s only gonna last for 1-2 hours. If you are a MGS fan, buy it, you’ll love it and play it a lot.UPDATE: There is a modding community going on for GZ! The mods are funny! They change the models so we can play as Kaz, Chico, and other characters! LOL"

That's not the case withGZ.Bear with me for a moment, this game focuses on giving you a glimpse of whatThe Phantom Painwill be.GZputs you in control of Snake (aka Big Boss) in an infiltration mission, but gives you the freedom to explore the mission area and tackle objectives as you see fit. With collectibles spread throughout the map, it invites you to step in every corner, watch enemy movements and memorize them, listen to soldiers' conversations, hijack vehicles, all adding up to the experience and helping you reach your goal. This main story centricalGround Zeroesmission, can take from anywhere between 15 minutes and 1 hour or more since there's no time limit, also depending if you go full stealth or guns blazing towards your objective.After you're done with the main mission, you unlock pseudo historical recreations of events prior to theGround Zeroesmission in forms of Side Operations. These Side Ops have different targets and goals, from eliminating 2 targets in the entire military base, to destroying enemy turrets just before an airstrike. All of them take place in the same area as theGround Zeroesmission, but you get a specific starting point for each one of them. Again, you're free to tackle your objectives however you see fit.There are two more unlockable Side Ops which main feature is fan service. I could explain those two but why ruin the surprise?You can look online or in Steam for guides on how to unlock them anyway.If you're a fan of the games and story, there are little nods to the past of the series. If you're new to the series, these collectibles and tapes will show you part of a great cohesive plot that has been developed over some great games, hopefully ending you with trying the rest of the MGS games.All in all $20 isn't overpriced because the content is there. It is locked behind extras, but taking into mind how it's possible to put to sleep an entire army with a tranquilizer gun, then run over them with a tank,what you get is based on how and for how long you play. As of the moment of this reviewMetal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroescomes bundled for free with each pre-order ofMetal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, so you get to experience this game just before the main course is released.Short version:Ground Zeroes is a prologue game, not a demoShows you the core mechanics of the upcoming Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom PainAllows for replayability based on how you tackle objectivesHas side missions with different objectives, with many ways to tackle themMany collectibles, some of them unlock more missions and story elementsWhat you see in the game depends on how you play and for how long you playAs of the moment of this review,Ground Zeroesis free with each pre-order ofThe Phantom PainThank you for your time, I hope this helps your decision of whether getting or not this game.

Nothing stops you from choosing your own way of completing the mission, no more corridors - this adds a lot of replayabitily. Some content was cut from the final version (knocking on walls, bullet casings etc - whole list is on community forums), but it doesn't matter that much since it should be in The Phantom Pain.

It's something that the whole series does well, so it should be expected though. As I have only had the experience with MGS 1, 2, Snake Eater and Revengeance, the melee controls seem fluid and faultless. All in all, the combat system and stealth are amazing, and I wouldn't change anything about them.Now, I seem to be saying this every time I review a big AAA game, but these are some absolutely gorgeous graphics, whack all the settings up to full and you are looking at an actual piece of artwork. I couldn't believe how real the world looks in here. The character models, faces, everything, this game really shows off the power of PC gaming.Ground Zeroes is the prologue for a future MGS title, Phantom Pane, although I understand Phantom Pane is going to be a much bigger title, I still felt a little miffed off that I was paying £16,99 for a game that only lasted two hours, and that's with doing the extra missions at the end. The actual main story can be completed in less than an hour if you know what you are doing....this to me was the only negative point from this release.I had no technical issues at all, it's quite surprising to see a developer who mainly makes games for consoles, push out such a well-made port. A nice, steady, 60 fps the whole time playing.The final verdict on Ground Zeroes; I would recommend it, but maybe wait until it drops on sale so you don't feeling the same as I did with regards to the game's length. If it wasn't for that, I'd say this is a must buy and a great game to test your rigs on.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

What I can say is that from the 1-2 hours of gameplay you get out of it, its an amazing experience and a lot of fun, and I personally cannot wait for the Phantom Pain. So I recommended this to people who love MGS or are interested in the franchise but don't pay anymore than $13-16 for it because its a demo its really not worth the extra dollars. However I don't recommended to the average consumser because there are plenty of games out there that are purchasable for $20 or less, that you'll get a lot more out of then this paid for demo.

Although there is only a single mission in the game, it has a lot of replayability potential. It is cool to replay it using different approaches and by taking different routes. That mission is supposedly a prelude to MGS V: The Phantom Pain, and it is about rescuing two prisoners from a clandestine US facility on Cuba. The cinematics provided are fantastic and make me want to buy The Phanom Pain right away. There are also plenty of bonus missions set on the same map and with very diverse objectives, further increasing the game's potential. The gameplay is fun and addicting, but the IA is a bit questionable at times. Plus, it takes a lot of shots to bring someone down, and even then they usually don't die and come back up. I really hope that everyone is walking around with three layers of kevlar vest, otherwise it is just an immersion-breaker. The graphics are good, with gorgeous facial art, and it is optimized beautifully on PC. I run it with (mostly?) everything maxed out and I get constant 60 fps on my very modest machine.

Following the iconic Sold Snake, the series has maintained a strong consistency of quality and diversity, bringing us to a variety of different beautiful locations and establishing some of the best stealth action mechanics available. While we are waiting for the release of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, Kojima Productions have yet to cease development on Ground Zeroes, bringing the short prologue to the dynamic PC platform.Ground Zeroes is one large camp Big Boss needs to break into and rescue two captives from Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker: Chico and Paz. If the player goes into the campaign a little stealthily, while at the same time not avoiding killing anyone when need be, they can beat it in roughly an hour.The Metal Gear Solid franchise is well known for their lengthy and incredibly detailed cinematics, and this is somewhat similar. The difference is that there’s only two major cutscenes, taking place at the beginning and end of the campaign, along with another two very brief moments mid-mission. Unfortunately, you’ll be stumped at what’s going on and who the characters are if this is the first time jumping into a Metal Gear game, but there is a rough breakdown through a slideshow available on the main menu.Outside of the short main campaign, there are a handful of side operations to partake in. These give players objectives to accomplish in the same open area that are completely optional, but do offer a decent amount of variety. The short main campaign will not last you long, unless there’s a strange desire to go back and speed run the mission, and while these aren’t particularly lengthy themselves, ranging from five to fifteen minutes, they are a nice change of pace. They also sometimes unlock plot related content through the cassette tapes, whether mission oriented or through Chico’s hidden set.Gameplay is Ground Zeroes’ strong point as the leap from Metal Gear Solid 4 is noticeable. Kojima Productions have crafted a sizable open area to move across, with soldiers that populate it and go about their daily businesses. While it’s only one area and really only one type of grunt enemy, it’s the mechanics that really show off what a modern stealth action titles should be. The controls feel a lot looser than they once did, with more modern implementations such as sprinting, jumping into a prone position, regenerating health, and much more. Enemy behavior is very different this time around, having an on-screen notification pop-up when an enemy has caught a glimpse of Big Boss.The more time spent out in the open, the more likely they will come to investigate, contact HQ to inform them of a suspicious individual, or outright call for backup. This somewhat ties into the new Reflex feature that is entirely optional for purists out there. Instead of gunfire raining down on Big Boss when spotted, he will have an opportunity to not only automatically turn towards the enemy, but be able to fire on them while in slow-motion.Unfortunately, players did run into some hitches in the frame rate on AMD graphics cards, while Nvidia based units seem to run the game magnificently. This is a step up in the visual department, allowing for even more objects on screen and greater effects if your computer rig can handle it. Outside of the graphical options, the controls have also been decently implemented, as well. While it’s still preferred to use a controller for how many different commands there are, the keyboard and mouse controls still offer an adaptation worthy of praise, and allows for a little more precision when aiming.Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is a nice bite-sized piece of content that will help players get a good grasp on what to expect when The Phantom Pain is released.It retains the stealth features hardcore fans have come to enjoy, while at the same time implementing various modern mechanics that will appeal to an even greater audience. This also marks the first time Kiefer Sutherland replaces David Hayter as Big Boss, cementing the actor’s place in the series. While it may only take an hour or so to complete the main mission that acts as the prologue to the next game, the PC port of Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes not only lives up to expectations, but surpasses them in creating an overly satisfying sandbox to sneak through."

People said that it should have been released for free and that it was just a cheap way to ‘cash in’ on the Metal Gear hype. However, as you would expect from Hideo Kojima and his team, Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is a masterpiece, in it’s own right.The layers of detail and purposefully built in replay value, make this ‘single area’ game, well worth your time (and money). It is loaded with ‘fan service’ and ‘Easter eggs’, with lots of references to previous games in the series. This version also includes all the DLC, which were previously exclusive to different consoles, before the PC release. It also runs flawlessly for me on a GTX980 running Windows 10.I really enjoy the gameplay style of Ground Zeroes which requires you to revisit the same environment, many times, in multiple different ways. It encourages me to further appreciate the immersive atmosphere and attention to detail in this single environment. In fact, I got hooked on Ground Zeroes a lot quicker than I did with Phantom Pain, which I still haven’t finished.Considering that Kojima’s creative process was interfered with during the completion of Phantom Pain. Ground Zeroes seems more like a sincere Metal Gear experience than Phantom Pain is. I love this game and that’s what Ground Zeroes is in my opinion, a full game, that stands strong on it’s own. It’s an excellent, fully fleshed out masterpiece, which (considering it’s size) is filled with great content."

,Recommended,311340,24939284,"Posted: 15 August, 2016",all,lotsoflol,"Yeah, yeah. Metal Gear Solid V: The Two Hour Game. This review contains spoilers for the entirety of Ground Zeroes, the ending of Peace Walker, and certain aspects of The Phantom Pain.Ground Zeroes is basically a demo for The Phantom Pain, but not playing it leaves you without the (admittedly sparse anyway) full experience of Metal Gear Solid V.You'll see people argue that GZ is a waste of time and money, but honestly, that's wrong. This is the most well-optimised, polished, handcrafted game in years. It runs on my toaster at graphic settings far better than my original Xbox 360 experience, which is worthy of the extra money spent on it.StoryGround Zeroes starts shortly after Peace Walker's true ending, where Paz and Zeke vanish into the ocean. From the opening shot of Snake in the helicopter, the player knows that this is the darkest direction the Metal Gear series has ever gone in - the trailers were bleak, the voice acting far less comedic than previous entries, the music brooding and ominous. Ground Zeroes is the darkest of the series. Within the first five minutes we see prisoners being tortued at Camp Omega (a kind of obvious stand-in for Guantanamo Bay), Snake without the iconic bandana, and a cinematically brilliant introduction consisting of one long, uninterrupted take. Snake's mission is simple enough, considering previous games - break into Camp Omega, retrieve Chico, and confirm Paz's survival.It's up to the player whether this goes south sooner rather than later; guns blazing is an option here, but it renders the cutscenes completely illogical. We're introduced to the villain of the overall MGSV story - Skull Face. The name sounds ridiculous and honestly the accent does too. But the depravity contained within cassette tapes that fill in the gaps between what we know and what's left to our imagination open up his character as a man willing to do evil to secure his end goals - at least, whatever those are, because we aren't told in Ground Zeroes. All we do know is, he uses Snake's absence from Mother Base to stage a fake nuclear inspection, allowing his unit (XOF, a name choice that seems bizarre until TPP where it either gets even stupider or becomes genius depending on your outlook) to attack MSF without any real resistance. The action resumes nine years later in The Phantom Pain.GameplayOne of the complaints Peace Walker received was an awkward control system excused by its initial appearance on the PSP. While the HD release on Xbox and PS3 fixed these, it was still a portable game at heart. Ground Zeroes returns to a far more traditional feel. Snake is more responsive than ever, capable of moving from a low crouched walk to a sprint without fear of accidentally going prone while attempting to stand up. Introduced in Ground Zeroes is a sticky cover system that actually works and a quick dive button that can be used to incapacitate enemies as well as duck out of sight. Holding up enemies in GZ is a simple matter of aiming at them, and utilising a new dialogue wheel to order information, call nearby guards, or force the enemy into submission. Also new to the series is vehicular movement - Snake can commandeer a Jeep, an APC, or transport truck. With these comes new infiltration opportunities - Snake can hide in the bed of a truck for example, or load a Jeep with passengers to make a quick getaway.The player is free to test their skills in all areas - stealth, shooting and driving.MusicAs with Peace Walker and Guns of the Patriots, the classic Metal Gear Theme is not used here due to copyright issues. In Ground Zeroes, the player is free to use their own tracks in-game as helicopter music or a soundtrack. There isn't much of a soundtrack to go with anyway, as the Harry Gregson-Williams orchestral pieces are gone in favour of more sombre, mysterious music stings. Of particular mention is the Joan Baez version of Here's To You - this song will play at least three times in a normal playthrough of the main mission. A true soundtrack returns mainly in the bonus missions, and alert/combat phases do convey a sense of urgency and danger. It's not bad by any sense, but you'll hear nothing like Yell Dead Cell or Clash With Evil Personified.GraphicsThanks to the FOX Engine (which will never be used again outside of Pro Evo and Pachinko machines), Metal Gear Solid V looks fantastic. It scales to any rig, even looking impressive at low settings. Similar to Half-Life 2, the design of Ground Zeroes ensures that whatever the game is played on, it will be playable and visually appealing regardless of specs. Of particular note is the rain and hair - every surface looks appropriately shiny and slick due to the downpour during the Ground Zeroes mission, and Snake's model is amazingly realistic.Even if you don't play The Phantom Pain, Ground Zeroes is worth a low price of admission. Who knows; maybe you'll actually like it more than the sequel."

,Recommended,311340,25519315,"Posted: 15 September, 2016",all,Baphomet,"Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes is the in-between game for MGS: Peace Walker and The Phantom Pain and stars our favorite protagonist: Snake (a.k.a. Big Boss). The game itself has a very short story portion supported by a couple challenge missions and some achievement hunting, thus you won’t find yourself getting a complete experience like you would with all the other games in the metal gear series. Instead, MGS:GZ serves as an appetizer to get the player acclimated to the new storyline and gameplay before the main course that is TPP.Speaking of gameplay, GZ has a lot of similarities in systems in previous MGS games. You still have to keep low and use darkness to your advantage when sneaking around and this time there is no form of radar similar to the soliton radar in MGS1 and 2. Instead, you can mark targets with your binoculars or close-range “aiming” and they then become trackable as if via GPS (albeit impossible given the time period the game is supposed to take place in) as well as visible through walls. If you manage to get to a guard tower with good enough visibility, this lets you spot a good number of the enemies on the map, making things considerably easier for the rest of the mission. Detection works very similar to other MGS games and other than the graphical representation, yields the same kind of results depending on how long you were noticed. If you manage to snuff a guard after he radios in a suspicious person or noise, but before he gives the all clear, guards will be pulled from other positions on the base to check it out and the alert level will be raised appropriately (just like MGS3).The game does also have a pair of bonus missions for when you manage to collect all of the hidden XOF badges during the first (story) mission. Both of which pay homage to earlier works by Hideo Kojima, the creator of the series.One pet peeve I had with MGS:GZ was that the control scheme for gamepads is drastically different from previous MGS games. Fans familiar with the previous games will probably find themselves hitting the wrong buttons at the wrong times as I certainly did. Surprisingly, I found the game to be more enjoyable (and easier) with mouse and keyboard as the added accuracy made getting headshots a breeze and the rest of the control mappings made sense to me (C for crouch, shift for sprint, etc).In the end, MGS:GZ is a well-polished game that comes up a bit short in playtime, but since it’s also short in price (especially on sale!) you won’t feel ripped off. Just like the appetizer before the main course, this game will serve to whet your appetite for the feast that is The Phantom Pain."

So passing under their eyes this time will take so much more skill (and that's a good thing).Some people believe the game only features the main mission (Ground Zeroes), but there's so much more to the package!The 6 side/extra missions (which take place in the same map, but different times of the day) are really well made and they offer a complexity and dynamism i really didn't expect.It was a true joy playing them.So in the end you get a very well made prologue with 7 missions that can easily take you something like 8 hours to complete with an s-rank, and that assuming you don't want to chase achievements (For that you'll need so many more hours), all for a very very small price (You can find this game online (legit keys) for 10 dollars).A brief note on the technical side; the port is amazing! It's greatly optimised and works flawlessly.The graphics are perfect! A huge amount of detail and an amazing lighting system. the fox engine is a true beast.This prologue really gives us a small teste of the masterpiece the phantom pain will be, and it's highly recommended to all MGS fans.Pros:- Modern Stealth Gameplay- Fluid Character's Movements- Satisfying Difficulty (If played as a stealth purist)- Amazing ""Sandbox-Style"" map- Many different approaches to the same goals- Inspired side missions- Many easter eggs- Many Collectables/Hidden objectives- Greatly Optimised Port- AMAZING Graphics- Amazing presentation (As usual with Kojima)Cons:- Only one (Even if very big and articulated) map- Needs too much patience to complete achievements (Some of which ask you to complete the same missions over and over and over again)- The game can be completed in a very short time, if played without chasing the ultimate stealth experience.- Makes the wait for the phantom Pain even harder than it used to be"

,Recommended,311340,29946373,Posted: 15 February,all,SoI|dCentur|0,"It's no secret that Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain had a narrative which doesn't reach the heights of the past entries in the series; if there's one thing to expect from a Metal Gear game, it's the engaging story and cutscenes, playing around with the ludicrous, and cramming all of the philosophical ideas and themes pertaining to technology and warfare. The entirety of MGSV could be thought of as Hideo Kojima's way of saying thanks to the series' fans, who have kept the Metal Gear brand relevant in the gaming industry for over 30 years - a collective passion and dedication, which forms the basis of the series' finale: we, the players, carry on the title of Big Boss. Heartfelt? Sure. Corny? Well, it wouldn't be a Hideo Kojima Game if it wasn't. However, it was a very rough road to take, and The Phantom Pain celebrated the series' end with very little fanfare. Ground Zeroes, on the other hand, started Metal Gear Solid V with such promise, and it offered me a better experience than its other half. From just the 2-hour prologue, it was evident that the series was ready to tackle a bold new direction, providing the spectacle and intrigue that The Phantom Pain severely lacked.Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes takes place in Camp Omega: a U.S. naval prison facility - reported black site - located at the southernmost tip of Cuba. Big Boss received word that Paz Ortega survived the ZEKE explosion, and is now being held prisoner along with Chico at the facility. Due to Paz being the only lead that MSF has on Cipher, and the fact that Chico somehow sent out a distress call while bound in chains, Big Boss is forced to take matters into his own hands, and infiltrate the camp to rescue them both.Back when MGSV was first announced, Kojima promised a mature Metal Gear story, which would explore real-life issues that he normally doesn't tackle. Ground Zeroes somehow fulfilled that promise by highlighting the prisoners and their torment at the camp, rather than focusing on Big Boss himself. Right off the bat, the player is greeted by hooded prisoners on their knees, surrounded by growling guard dogs and heavily-armed soldiers; the camera focuses on a minor with a small hole on his chest, and bolts on his ankles, seemingly traumatized and out of touch with everything around him; cassette tapes bring light about the brutal and disgusting torture methods used by the officials at the camp. What's outstanding about Ground Zeroes is that it set up the intended mature tone so well, exploring the human nature and relishing the silent moments, but eventually dialed everything back for The Phantom Pain, where Kojima takes another shot at the Metal Gear tropes that he established.Skull Face was supposed to be the next big Metal Gear villain, with the potential to top some of the best characters in the series. He is only shown for a brief moment during Ground Zeroes' campaign, wearing an outfit similar to the Lone Ranger, and an eventual glimpse of his heavily-scarred face; even so, his power and influence can be seen throughout the camp, and his backstory - as told through cassette tapes - imply a vengeful man, who had everything taken from him, and forced to serve different masters wherever he went. Enter The Phantom Pain, where his role has been relegated to that of the typical evil mastermind, who will stop at nothing to make sure that everyone who knows the English language dies.The events leading up to that grand finale of The Phantom Pain had been very lackluster, and Ground Zeroes could only offer a small glimpse of how the entirety of Metal Gear Solid V could have really felt like, if more time was given for developing it. On the grand scheme of things, Ground Zeroes could have been filled with any type of excuse for Venom to be involved in an accident, and end up in that Cyprus hospital. It was disappointing that the only thing that mattered in this prologue is the ending.And there you have it."

The only game of the series that I have played is MGS4 way back on PS3 and I loved the entire playthrough but never got around to doing it again or buying another. Recently I was sold on MGS5 TPP and this (Ground Zeroes) happened to come with a pre-order of the game. While this does give you something to play and test before MGS5 TPP comes out, the variety seems to lack a little because of the 1 zone; I guess that's what you get from a ""demo"" of sorts.

The reason for this is that is basically because this is a confined zone with one ~50 minute main mission and a few side missions with spins off the original. Some would say it was a slightly ""more playable demo"" before the actual larger game comes out. The only time this would have been a good buy is with the pre-order bundle or if you really can't wait to play the new game.

However I believe what is on offer is very good if slight. The game contains a two hour story prequel mission with your typical MGS production that tasks you with rescuing 2 targets from a sandbox style prison camp. There are other things to do in the camp such as find collectables which unlock a set of bonus mission etc. After you finish the main campaign there are something called side ops, which change the time of day and give you different objectives to complete inside the same prison. Their are also a lot of lore filling audio logs regarding the characters in the game. Visually the game looks great, running at almost 3 times the visual fidelity of the next gen console version on max settings, and is easily one of the best optimised; If not the best, games of the year.I would say if your a Metal Gear fan this is easily worth the asking price simply for the production values and being able to play in the stealth sandbox, others may want to wait for a sale before grabbing it.My opinion is it's a great taster of what is to come and well worth playing."

We are used to fixed routes and blindspots and tricks and most of them wouldnt have worked in this new amazing system. So why are you still reading this? Just go buy it now while its on sale and make up your own mind.. How do you want to complete this mission? By slicing everyones neck? Slow and stealthy? Take your chances blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up cus its fun? Or giving everyone and there mommas a shakedown on info... So many routes, so many ways to complete the objective. (Hint: you dont need to extract people in helicopters ;) )Enjoy this teaser of whats to come and practice practice practice. Because when the Phantom Pain comes, will you be ready?"

So I was wondering what would The Phantom Pain be like, but I didn't want to buy it considering my previous experience with MGS series. That's where Ground Zeroes comes in - especially for the sweet price it is now (it's about $2.5 for me). So I've spent a few hours trying out GZ and I've liked it. The gameplay is so much more polished than before, story is great and it's twists are unpredictable. Now I clearly know that I'll be buying The Phantom Pain when it goes on a good sale.So the moral of this story is: if you want to know if you'd like The Phantom Pain or not - try Ground Zeroes first. But be sure to buy it on sale."

In a lot of ways it bares more resemblance to open world action games than it does any of the previous Metal Gear games.The game takes place before the original Metal Gear and follows Big Boss on a rescue mission. The story isn't much to write home about given it's essentially the introduction to the Phantom Pain. Not a lot of the story is introduced to you, and it eventually ends on a rather unsatisfying cliffhanger. It is also unfortunately just a single mission with a few additional side ops that give you additional objectives while there.Fundamentally the biggest problem with Ground Zeroes is not it's length but it's pacing. It ends just when you expect it to really get good and it leads into a cliffhanger and then a trailer for the next game. This caused a huge amount of drama when the game first released. It also feels very unlike previous Metal Gear games. David Hayter doesn't voice Snake, there are no codec calls and there's no fourth wall breaking humor. A lot of these problems carry over into The Phantom Pain so you should be aware of that if you buy these games separately.The gameplay is all good though and it really blurs the line between action and stealth game. With hundreds of different ways to approach a single stealth mission. But it's not worth getting on it's own and the only reason to buy it is as a teaser while you're downloading The Phantom Pain."

Now I have never played any of the metal gear solid games and I've heard stories about this game being a lot shorter, but it's leading up to the story in phantom pain. Therefore I thought, well since I already own this one I'll give it a shot, before jumping into phantom pain.Finished it guns blazing in less then an hour, about the lenght of a decent demo. I got this pretty cheap in this steam bundle, but I feel sorry for anyone who bought this at full price, paying 40 dollar at release for such a short AAA-game, or even the current full price.  Half of the time I basically spent watching cutscenes, like really long cutscenes. They are well made and it must have looked really good back in 2014. They hold up okay still when graphics are maxed out.I've heard that the gameplay is really good at least, and everything accept the game lenght basically, but now that I have played it myself I have to disagree. This is not a perfect PC port at all. Sure, the game runs at 60 frames per second which is nice, but same buttons used for multiple things.  R is used both for picking up weapons and bodies, great when they are always besides eachother! Picked the wrong thing up many times and I don't really get why a PC should have these controls. Using my keyboard to get around the options since the mouse doesn't work. Everything about the map and UI just feels clunky. I don't like games where I cant navigate even the main menu properly without an xbox-controller, or the map, missions, etc.The gameplay gets repetitive fast, even though I only played for about an hour. You can't shot in certain angles and im not a fan of the cover system. Feels like a console game in more then one way. I did not really enjoy the gunplay, used to a lot of other games being better in this aspect that also does stealth, for example far cry, hitman, etc. Didn't feel that the guns have that high inpact and not that satifying feel. The AI was somewhat questionable in their behavor, but decent. Never died once while playing and normal wasn't difficult at all, even when facing swarms of enemies. The bad guys repeat a lot of the same on the radio and I got tired of hearing it.After playing through the first game for me in this franchise, I can't say that im impressed by anything really. I'm gonna dive into phantom pain soon and hope that I'll enjoy the story, gameplay and  game lenght in that title more. This game was a disappointment in so many ways. I suggest avoiding this title, you can probably do just fine by looking up the backstory and cutscenes on something like youtube instead. This is a very average shooter, but even shorter then most. A big ""meh"" for me."

Under the direction of Kazuhira Miller and Huey, Militaires Sans Frontières turn their attention to an upcoming inspection by the UN amid suspicions that they possess a nuclear weapon, which MSF believe to be an attempt by the Cipher organization to stifle them. Their preparations are interrupted when MSF agents in Cuba investigate reports that Paz survived and has been detained at Camp Omega. The situation is complicated when Ricardo ""Chico"" Valenciano Libre attempts to rescue her and is similarly captured. Believing that both of them could compromise MSF, Snake is sent to infiltrate Camp Omega and extract them if they are alive, or confirm that they are dead and if so, determine what they revealed to their captors. Snake also recognizes the value in rescuing Paz, as he believes doing so will convince Cipher to stand down while Paz will be more willing to discuss Cipher's activities with MSF.Everything in this story is mature and handles it maturely nothing is out of place or put there merely for ""shock value"" if you have knowledge of ""Peace Walker"" on psp or simply listen to the audio codecs you'll know it happens for a reason. HIdeo is a master at clever writing with ""double agents"", malignant organizations, and controversial topics to move the game industry forward as a whole into a work of art.The character conversations are deeply engrossing and I slightly teared when Big Boss first finds Chico. This game solidly earns it's M+ rating and wouldn't recommend it to anyone under the age of 17 as there are depictions of extreme violence, torture, and gore.Gameplay: The threat detection system is revamped, with the removal of the onscreen meter or gauge to indicate the player that they are in the 'alert/evasion/caution' state as in previous games, which have instead been replaced by visual and audio representations. Snake's binoculars have also been revamped; instead of selecting the binoculars as an item, the binoculars are hot keyed to a button. The player is able to mark enemies and be aware of their locations in the iDroid's holographic display. There are directional cues to help players when an enemy sees them from a distance and gets closer to them. A new ""Reflex Mode"" is activated when an enemy finds Snake and the player only has a short window of time (in slow motion) to take out the enemy before he fully sounds the alarm (a hissing audio cue can be heard if the player is detected by searchlight). Lights can be shot out to further aid the player's stealth efforts.Thats some of the new things that can be found in this latest iteration of the franchise, next up comes cqc and takedowns which for anyone who has played a mgs game in the past, more specifically ""Metal Gear Solid 3"" should be familiar with, although here it's expanded upon with guards being much more dynamic depending on the situation ahd the level of freedom to not being constrained to any one point in the base. Once you grab a guard in a chokehold there are a number of things you can do such as make them yell out for assistance to the nearest guard to take both of them out in one fell swoop, or perhaps interrogate him for information on locations with more weaponry? The number of ways to take on an obstacle deeply varied depending on your playstyle. Of course all the previously mentioned things such as ""reflex mode"" and third person shooting can be turned off for purists wanting the ultimate challenge.Sound: The design, soundstage, voice-acting, original score, all work harmoniously this is top notch quality at work here the production value is through the roof for this game and they really have invested big into it to bring this game to life. From ambient sound such as the rain pitter patting down to the ground and changing when going indoors to a ""clunk"" on the metal roof. Or the plop of a boot walking through mud, it all puts you there in the moment for you to enjoy and completley immerse yourself into the experience.Guns sound top-notch more than likely recorded in a professional studio first hand; every bullet being fired off packs a punch into your ears and shells falling to the ground give off a distinctive sound, reloading a magazine sounds authentic snapping into place just right.Now I know many of you have been complaining about the new voice actor Mr.Sutherland, while he may not be the original Snake voice we all know and love he gets the job done just fine, and rather adding some emotion into Big Boss's voice through sadness, shock, or humor all being translated well into the game. And subjectively speaking I rather like his new voice gives Big Boss some depth as opposed to the monotone and gruff voice that we use to have.Graphics: Wow thats all I can say... wow, wow, wow. The best looks to performance ratio game I've played in years, the game is very well optimized and I regard it highly as one of the best running games I have ever played. I was able to crank everything up to it's maximum settings at 1080p with an older gtx 660ti while still running it at a smooth 45-60fps. Now thats what you call optimization, a large number of settings are there for you to tweak to your hearts content from lighting detail to ssao and special effects it's all there for the taking. Heck I was able to get this running on an old laptop at 720p and it still ran great at 30fps, looked really good too, so don't be afraid to buy this software for an older running machine.The Fox Engine is really being utilized to it's full potential here, some-things in the game from research I've done has actually been laser-scanned into the game such as rocks and twigsto add on to the ground, cinematography effects as well, depth of field, bokeh, and yes the infamous lens flare are all used to great extent in this game giving it as always a signature kojima flair that adds to the mood of the game, very reminiscint of film effects. Facial expressions and character models are highly detailed with each wrinkle on snake's face telling a story of his past and expressing emotion depending on the situation. Animations are out of this world good, acting in realistic ways whenever shooting, falling, or choking someone out and motion capture quality I haven't seen since a little game called ""The Last Of Us"".Conclusion: ""Half as long, twice as bright"". ""Short but sweet"". These are the words that come to mind when investing my hard earned money into this game and playing through it again and again, simply pumping me up and setting the  bar higher for other developers to topple, there is loads of content here, new easter eggs to discover and accomplishments to topple in a mission. Buy this game with peace in mind that you will enjoy it, I give it my personal recommendation to everyone and anyone who enjoys gaming! Although be forwarned this is a ""tactical espionage"" game take it nice and slow the less people alerted the better.I hope you enjoyed my review, and as always have a nice day.Final Score: 9/10"

Wait for a sale or something, since it's not exactly long. I mean, you CAN pump a lot of hours into this game, but if you're contributing to the overall completion percentage, the majority of the time you're going to be trying to fulfill ""Tasks"" like looking for collectables or doing ""Challenges"" like marking all of the guards as fast as you can.Like, five times over.However, by no means is it a demo. It has a lot of hours that could be put into it, but not many people actually want to put those hours in because of how repetitive it would get after a while, if you're intent on getting 100% completion and don't spend your time replaying missions.I reccomend it because it's fun.

Even though i'm new to the franchise, i still finished the game in less than 20 minutes, which leads me to my next point, the lack of the main story, which is really disappointing. I am not talking about the content of the game itself, because the game is very rich in content, since you can play various missions, including rescuing Kojima himself, assassinations, and playing as the mighty Raiden ( yes, he's mighty, screw the haters ), but i still wish the main story was just a little bit longer.Overall, i will conclude my review with some of the pros and cons based on my personal experience with the game:PROS:- Amazing optimization, almost flawless, constant 60 FPS with everything maxed out ( please don't envy me ).- Challenging enemy AI, their movements, response to suspicious movments, observation of the environment is almost perfect, leaving you with a since of challenge, and a satisfying feeling once you go past them.- Great storytelling, voice acting, cutscenes, basically a very promising story to the full game, The Phantom Pain.- Lovable characters ( oh really?), yes, i'm yet to find a dull or a disappointing character in this game, maybe because it's short, but that's what it is.- There's more, literally, everything in the game is awesome.CONS:- Lack of story based missions ( they should've called this a demo, yep, that controversy again).FINAL VERDICT:Aperfect10 out of 10.It's clear that this is just the begining of something amazing to come, which is The Phantom Pain, so don't take this review as a review for the whole MGS franchise, or The Phantom Pain, it's basically a review of a demo, a prolouge that should've been free, but oh well, it's still worth your time and money, and it will help you to get to know the controls and the mechanics of the full game, The Phantom Pain, Plus, you can upload your save files from this game ( Ground Zeros ) to the full game ( The Phantom Pain ) which will unlock some cool stuff!REVIEW SUMMARY ( if you're lazy to read ):It's pretty good."

,Recommended,311340,13968203,"Posted: 13 January, 2015",all,Drivershaft,"First of all if you're just looking for a linear story experience then buy something else, this is not the cutscene heavy go from point a to point b typical metal gear game.If you can get over that and actually adapt to the new gameplay style you will vastly enjoy this game and get more than your money's worth. This is a game about exploration and experimentation. There is one main mission and six side missions, two of which are unlockable. If you just go through the missions just to beat them you'll probably get 4-5 hours of content, possibly more depending on how long it takes you to tackle those missions.The real meat of the game is experimenting with the new fox engine and how to tackle those missions. For example there is a side mission where you have to assassinate two targets, now you can just go and kill them, you can go and grab a sniper rifle and take them out from a distance to more easily escape, you can extract both of the targets by chopper to get more information, it's up to you.There's also prisoners and hidden secrets in every mission and context sensitive events that can be uncovered and triggered. All of these hidden secrets are the main story of this game. If you want to understand why certain characters act a certain way during the main game or what happened before you got there you have to uncover the tapes, they also potentially reveal information about The Phantom Pain. There's also XOF patches to find to unlock the two extra missions as well as unlockable weapons that can be placed at the starting point of each mission.The gameplay is amazing in this game, with the addition of open world gameplay you have no radar so you have to mark and pay attention to enemies, there are such small details added that affect gameplay like the difference in knockout time between choking a guard, tranquilizing a guard and punching out a guard, how long a guard will stay asleep in a dark area versus a sunny area and other features. Reflex mode is an optional bullet time that triggers when you're spotted and it balances out the guard AI which can spot you from anywhere and from far distances especially on hard difficulty,As a PC port of a console game this is one of the best PC ports I've ever played, there are so many customization options and it has been optimized perfectly and the controls are excellent with the exception of no mouse control in menus.There is also a lot of mod support for this game and I have no doubt the modding community for this game will expand and produce more content in the future, this game is amazing and definitely worth the money if you can accept it as a new type of experience."

,Recommended,311340,13435305,"Posted: 18 December, 2014",all,InsanelyOrange,"I was not dissapointed.Time and replayability:Took me roughly 2 hours to finish the game, which consisted of me completing only the main objective and rescuing a few POWs. That in itself is a large downside to the game, but there's defiantly replayability here, you unlock many different side objectives when playing through the game. Plus, when you beat it for the first time, the hard difficulty is unlocked. However, if the idea of replaying the same area over and over with variations (being time, weather, enemy patrols and objectives) is off putting, you may want to hold out on this.Story:People like myself jumping into the game without playing much MGS (I've only played snake eater) will have no idea whats going on but there are explinatons in game. The main one, called ""backstory"" in the menu, briefly recalls the events leading up to GZ and does it very well. There are also tapes that you can listen to so you can fullly understand characters motivations. Very good story.The Port:In regards to the PC port, it's excellent.I'm running a 3 or 4 year old rig, (CPU: Phenom II 955 and GPU: 6870(1GB)) and the game runs very well, despite the games min requirements being a 4GB (I think this has now been changed to 2GB). I get 45-60fps with everything on high except one or two things on medium. You can also alt-tab the game without it breaking and the keys can be rebound. Unfortionatly though, the menus are not mouse driven, you have to use arrow keys and enter to navigate through them. That however isn't a big issue for me, just a minor complaint. There are some very minor and slightly annoying bugs. But they do not effect the overall game experiance and will easily be patched out.This is an excellent game if you like stealth games, solid gameplay and performance. However, the length and the replayability for the price will put people off. Perhaps it should have been sold at $10 instead. Still, I recommend it if you don't mind playing in the same location."
,Recommended,311340,13437452,"Posted: 18 December, 2014",all,Divisor,"Listen... listen.If you're not already a fan of Metal Gear Solid, Ground Zeroes is not for you. Phantom Pain might be, but Ground Zeroes is not.This is coming from somebody whose absolute favorite game is Metal Gear Solid, and while I would normally recommend it to anybody even slightly interested in stealth-action or sci-fi games, I wouldn't recommend they start with GZ. Why?Wwwell, Ground Zeroes is essentially a tech demo and a prologue to Metal Gear Solid V as a whole. It was released because Konami wanted to put something out alongside the release of the PS4 and Xbone, but Phantom Pain wasn't going to be ready at the time, so Hideo Kojima decided to put out what he had ready so far. That was Ground Zeroes.The main mission, the story, is about an hour long if you take your time. Outside of that, there's a few side missions you can do which, while they're pretty unique from one another (and pretty fun, too), are mostly just there for the sake of padding. There really isn't a lot here in terms of content. It's a game that will only give you as much entertainment as the time you're willing to put into it. For people who aren't already fans of MGS, that probably isn't going to be a lot, and it's going to give them a lackluster first impression of the series.That's one reason.The other, which is definitely pretty biased on my part, is that the plot simply takes place at a point in the overarching story that I don't feel is really accessible to people who don't already know what's going on. It's like an interquel, almost, in that it centers around a very important character at a very important point in the grand timeline somewhere between the rest of the MGS games. If you have little to no understanding of what has happened in past games, though, you're either going to feel very lost, not very invested, or both. You're missing out on a LOT.Bottom line, if you're interested in Metal Gear Solid, find a way to start with the older games! I recommend release order. Join me in praying that one day we'll see some PC releases of those games.If youarea fan of MGS already, however, and you haven't played this on console yet, you should! The complaint that it's really short is still very legitimate even for a fan, but as long as you understand what you're going to be getting out of it (which many people who had that complaintdidn't), I think it's a very, very solid prologue and a really promising look at what's to come with Phantom Pain. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is tight and refreshing, all kinds of stuff. It is a reeaally fun game. There are a lot of other reviews that'll tell you the same things and in better detail, I'm sure.That being said, I understand if you find it difficult to justify a $20 pricetag for a game you will mooost likely get around five hours of playtime out of. If you're not dying to play another, brand new MGS game like I was, wait around for Phantom Pain. Buy both at the same time. It'll feel just like the Tanker mission (like I'm sure it was supposed to in the first place)."

Raw mouse input. None of that annoying smoothing you have to disable in game files. Speaking of which, more than enough video options in-game. The many controls available aren't awkward at all on KB and Mouse. I can't comment on controller functionality, though.""Oh look, another console PORT!!!!""Nope, nuh-uh, you could not be more wrong, my friend! Kojima proves himself to be way up there, again, by caring about this project. I buy a lot of games. I don't have the best PC: FX8350 (OC'd to 4) - R9 270X - 8GB RAM and an SSD. Most games that have come out recently either had ridiculous fluctuating FPS, endless micro-stutter, and needed to be run on PC Gamer Life Support (Beta GPU drivers, file editing, bs life support software). These are the ""AAA"" games we're getting now. Basic, 100% PORTS. This?It defaulted to high on my rig. 1080, VSYNC on, high high high, borderless windowed. I have barely seen it dip in FPS, from 60. It runs smooth ""LIKE BUTTAH"". ""Oh, but ports always come with that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mouse smoothing thing..."" NOPE! Again! Raw input, baby! I'm telling you: This ""port"", runs better than any AAA game you've purchased recently, and probably looks a lot better too.As far as controls go, I'm also extremely satisfied. You know, when it comes to games developed for a stick, you usually get awkward ""robot movements"" because it's just 8 directions, with WASD. Character animations take care of making it look fluid.For content: Look at all the posts about people spouting out the running gag ""paid demo hurrrr hurrrr"" crap. You CAN get a lot of hours if you're into doing side-missions which are different enough to satisfy you, if you're looking for more. If this is a ""demo""? Then it's the best god damn demo you'll ever play!EDIT: Oh, you'll have to control menus with WASD, ESC and Space. If you aren't a Master Race diva and can deal with this, then that's really the only con I can think of."

If you're like me and wish to 100% the game like you should on any Metal Gear game then this will easily drag out 20 hours out of you at the least and feel like mere minutes as they say''Time flies when you're having fun''SHAKING THE FORMULAI've played roughly 16 hours as of writing this review and I'm only 35% through the game and as a long time Metal Gear player, this game feels much more.. difficult (if you turn off Reflex Mode as soldiers no longer can manually radio in to alert HQ of your sighting) and has it's fair share of upgrades and downgrades.The game feels much more organic and some things you'll do in this game will make you just think ''Wow, look how far we've come'', the gameplay itself can envoke feelings such as feelings of guilt, remorse and you'll be determined to do some actions and willing to ruin the run you're on by maybe murdering some of the soldiers on the base to carry out your actions.FOX ENGINE: IMPROVEMENTS AT A PRICEThe game is much more detailed than Metal Gear Solid 3 or 4 visually, but the problems in this game having a new engine merely is that there's clipping, a lot of it. In prior games after MGS1, soldiers, if knocked out near a wall where they'd usually clip would put their feet along the wall but in Ground Zeroes, their feet will rather clip. This could be an issue in the Fox Engine or maybe Ground Zeroes was rushed in the 2 years and 3 months since the reveal trailer back in September 2012.The game is very well optimised for a Metal Gear game on PC, if you've been following the series and played the PC port of MGS2, you would know how abbysmal that port was, requiring a gamepad or else the game is basically unplayable and all the issues in it. The keyboard and mouse controls feel well done enough, could have some improvements but all in all, is quite well done for Kojima Productions (or the porting team, not sure who did it) and leaves me quite optimistic for the future of Metal Gear returning back to PC.IS THIS A GOOD STARTING POINT FOR A NEW PLAYER?Dear god no, if you're one of those PC only players and this is your first Metal Gear, go rent/buy a PS3, buy Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection (it's got all the Metal Gear games except Ac!d, Ac!d 2, Portable Ops and Metal Gear Rising Revengeance)And play Chronologically so you can play like all the other fans who had expectations and such and how their expectations were blown away or shocked.HOW LONG IS THE MAIN STORY?From my first time playing on Normal, rescuing everyone bar one hidden prisoner, and getting caught about 5 times, 79 minutes.My replay where I killed noone, rescued everyone bar one hidden prisoner and getting caught once, 69 minutes.It's all how you play, remember, I'm only using the time the game gave me, and I'm not sure if that counts the cutscenes.VERDICTI'm very biased for this and this is one of my top ten releases of the year 2014, I can't give a proper rating as it'd be quite unfair.I had a lot of fun even though some stuff were downgraded, but for $20/€20, it's really if you know you're gonna play it alot and not just one playthrough then never play again as for that price point, one playthrough is like throwing your money away.How the ♥♥♥♥ am I meant to put my own music to play when the Helicopter flies to me? I want to listen to Jailbreak by Thin Lizzy so bad when the Helicopter arrives and it'd be lovely to have all the soldiers alerted because of that song while I bring 6-7 prisoners with me to leave."

Paying less than $10 would be fair considering the amount of content it brings. Most people will say the campaing is short, and it is, but the game offers more content after the main mission is completed. Easily you can get around 6 hours of total gameplay, a little more if you are not that good in these kind of games that require patience.Leaving that behind, the game looks outstanding on budget based computers, I enjoyed it with 8 GB of RAM, ATI Radeon 5870 and a Core 2 Quad Q8400 at a stable framerate, the cutscenes are all real time like I would expect from a Kojima directed metal gear game, no pre-rendered crap like MG: Rising. The gameplay is fluid and intuitive, the music is outstanding and the enemy AI is pretty descent.The story continues right after the events of Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, if you are new to the series, everything won't make much sense, there are some tapes and texts in the game that try to explain the events in the past games since MGS3: Snake Eater, but I would recommend playing or atleast watching a few videos about the story of Big Boss and his crew.I still don't understand why this was not included in the main game, just like in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, where you play the first part (prologue) with Snake and then you play the real game with Raiden. But still, it's a nice addition to the PC library of games, and a must have if you are a Metal Gear fan like myself.Enjoy!"

The main mission of the game can be finished in under an hour if you rush it, and in about 90 minutes if you take your time. It offers a few side missions with different objectives, but they all play out in the same area, just at different times of day.I would recommend the game though, but I strongly advice to wait for a sale or go for the Metal Gear Solid 5 Definitive Editon which at 30 Euros costs just as much as the normal The Phantom Pain game, but offers wayyyyyyy more.Even though the game is a glorified demo for TPP, it still is a great game and a great introduction to the Metal Gear series for newcomers."

Even on its release daily deal, the game's price tag is quite hefty for what is given, especially in comparison to other games on sale for less.Nitpicks aside, the game is genuinely fun and is a great port- my rig doesn't meet Recommended Specifications, yet I was able to run at near Max settings with very little fps drops.

First I'll address the port, and then I'll cover whether or not you should buy this game. I'll update the review if anything comes up to change my opinion of the port.First, my pertinent specs: GTX 770 2GB, i5 4690k stock speed, 8gb RAM.The port is excellent. Having made the jump from last gen console to PC, the difference in quality is enormous. I was able to max out the settings at 1080p with my modest rig with no problems. Mouse and keyboard settings are definitely serviceable. I haven't needed to rebind anything so far. My biggest complaints are the pop-in with some objects like crates and foliage, and enemies disappearing when too many are gathered in one place, or if you leave the vicinity. These issues were also present on console, but can be overlooked with the increase in draw distance and texture quality in my opinion. Finally, the menus can only be navigated with the keyboard/controller.As for whether or not you should buy this game, I can't recommend this game to every Metal Gear fan. If you're just interested in the continuation of the story, I suggest finding a story playthrough to watch online. However, Ground Zeroes is a sandbox that has a lot to offer if you're interested in learning the new MGSV mechanics, getting a taste for the capabilities of the Fox Engine, or taking apart the hints and details surrounding the game's new antagonist, Skullface. If you enjoyed the game on console and are looking for an upgrade in graphical fidelity, this game is probably worth picking up for you."

The game's freedom lends to its replayability, fans of games like Deus Ex or Dishonored will see themselves replaying to try different styles and earn a higher score. If you don't fall into that category, then expect 2 1/2 hours of solid gameplay.Gameplay wise, it's a stealth/action game, similar to Splinter Cell, with a score system that punishes you for playing the actiony side. You suffer no in-game consequences for playing it like a shooter other than it being tough as nails to deal with the amount of enemies they send at you. I can't really speak of how it compares to previous titles in the series, because I've never spent a substantial amount of time with one. The map is very open, I'd say it comes closer to the scale of the original Deus Ex than any game since, which for some will be a recommendation in and of itself.Controls are tight, I played on keyboard and mouse, ran into few issues with it, aside from movement while prone, which is clearly deisgned with a analog sick in mind. I'd probably recommend a gamepad, unless you're allergic to them, as I am.Port stuff: About a million options for graphics, gameplay and controls. The game is optimized like a dream; running with a 4690k, 8Gb of RAM and a GTX 770 4Gb, I never saw the game drop below 60 on Extra High(because an Ultra setting is for squares) other than when it first loaded into the game. It's exceptional looking compared to the console version, although I would like to have seen use of PhysX or something on flags and the windbreakers guards are wearing, it looks a little funky compared to the rest of the game. No mouse control in menus for no apparent reason, probably the only real black mark through.Overall I guess the game serves its purpose, because I am very excited for The Phantom Pain."

Kojima Studios has worked some serious magic with this title. There is some pop-in with objects in the distance, but not enough to distract from the gameplay. Texture work is good, and the animations are fluid.GAMEPLAY: This is the meat of the game, right here. People criticize Ground Zeroes for being very short--a ""paid demo"" is the popular taunt against it. Honestly, the main mission can be completed in as few as ten minutes if you skip cutscenes and play with wild abandon. But that's up to you! How you approach a mission is very free-form. The Side Ops add another couple hours to the game. Most of the fun here is in finding new ways to satisfy goals. In one mission, for example, I walked through the level detonating anti-air defenses with C4. On the second play-through, I just stole a rocket launcher from a guard and took out all three in under a minute.Of course, this being a Metal Gear Solid title, you have the option to go through each level without killing anybody (mostly); you'll be rewarded for non-lethal playthroughs with new gadgets at your start point. The fun is in finding new ways to satisfy mission objectives.STORY: Ha ha ha. Let's not even go there. You're Big Boss, invading a Cuban/American black site for I-don't-even-know-why, and doing lots of sneaky badassery along the way. It's Metal Gear. Don't think about the story, just enjoy the excuses it provides for you to do lots of interesting things.MUSIC/SOUND: Harry Gregson-Williams has consistently produced great tracks for Metal Gear Solid throughout the years, and his score here is just as good as his previous work. Use of licensed music, such as ""Here's to You"" is done skillfully. Sound design is great, all the character voices are cleanly rendered, the acting is mostly good (some overacting, but hey, it suits the story), and the audio for weapons and vehicles is accurate. Probably the one thing I have to say is that it's strange to play Big Boss and NOT hear David Hayter's voice come out!OVERALL: The main criticism leveled at this game has been its brevity. If you rush, you can beat it all in about three hours. If you take your time and enjoy the sandbox for what it is, you can play it for many hours more. This is a preamble for The Phantom Pain; I think we can safely say it's going to be good.I'm glad to have Big Boss on PC. He certainly kept us waiting long enough."

I had heard that David Hayter had moved on to other things and was open to our new snake. Honestly, it was a bit distracting and I didn't think it would be.If you go in expecting a full game or david hayter you will be disapointed. If however you play and see how well MGS works on this platform you will be pleasently impressed. New features like the spotting system are very solid and the combat is what I would expect from a super soldier. The graphics are rock solid as well and has a good frame rate on a midrange system. At times the AI is a bit stupid, I was able to take out 8 soldiers as they stupidly rushed the same choke point and ran into my waiting fist. This would not normally bother me but it would seem that kojima is trying to reinvent his brainchiled. So like any new game we need to be brutal.I think it could have been better myself, polish the AI, don't charge folks for a demo and if you are going to replace a voice actor, do not change to one that sounds 100% diferent then the one used a few years ago, people will probably notice, I know I did."

Sneak around corners, knock on walls or throw empty magazines to attract the enemy or lure them off, use a tranquilizer pistol ot if necessary, a silenced automatic rifle.

This is both a positive and negative given the massive cliffhanger it establishes as far as wanting more to this brief snippet of a much larger story.The controls are excellent, but are clearly intended for gamepad analog controls. Animations are as smooth as ever. Everything from shooting guards to knocking out guards to sneaking around feels both satisfying and rewarding on many levels.Overall the game is well worth the purchase if you are any kind of fan of the metal gear series or are simply interested in getting a bit of backstory buildup for the upcoming major release.At all maxxed out settings the game is probably one of the best looking games ever released (yes even compared to something like inquisition) and runs very smoothly on a single GTX 970.Cannot.

It looks and runs great (I really need to stress how solid this port job is) , it's easy to control with both gamepad and KB/M, and what's most important is that it provides a the player with a solid stealth experience.If you don't plan on buying The Phantom Pain, then it's going to be hard to sell you on this game since it's essentially a prequel (the final cutscene is literally a pre-rendered trailer), yet if you're not sure if you want to drop $60 on TPP, then you should consider testing out the game with Ground Zeroes.Hell, everyone should buy this game just to prove that there's a market for Japanese games on PC!Edit:♥♥♥♥ Konami"

For the price tag it came out at (13.39$) it is certainly worth it if you're a fan of the series and want some hands on play before the main game comes.That being said, in my opinion you could use Ground Zeroes to evaluate whether you might be interested in The Phantom Pain once it comes out since the entry price is so low.The game itself is not too short, with different missions all set in the same place at multiple times of the day. Playing this as a pure stealth game could make it last from 4 to 10 hours if you include at least some of the secondary objectives found on the map.S-ranking all missions might actually take you 5-8 more hours.PROs:- Great graphics- Great sound- Amazingly optimized- Tons of content for the size of the map the game is set in- Top notch realistic animations, easily amongst the best in the industry, which go a great way to give you the best feeling that you can find in a TPS- Excellent portingCONs:- Can be short if rushed through- Still some problems with the mouse movement in the iDroid map (if we really want to be picky)"

In addition to those missions there are various challenges in those missions that a player can attempt as well, along with additional difficulty levels.The main story and the challenge missions can all be accomplished quite quickly but with the additional challenges in each mission it can add some length to the amount of time you can get out of this game.  However the singular location does get old very quick as well.  As well the missions can be played in a variety of ways, brute forcing or going full stealth, kill everyone or kill no one.Some of the AI in the game is a little clunky and makes some interesting decision, but can pose a bit of a challenge at times as well.Your mileage on this game may vary, if challenging your self for better scores is something that doesn't appeal to you, than find the game at discount and enjoy the few missions in the game there is.

If you don't care about remaining quiet and run to the mission points, less than 30 minutes. The fact that there are a few vehicles in the island and even a turret means you can realistically just run and gun through the damn place and finish it in, perhaps, 20 minutes or less.Sure, when you first enter the island it seems pretty big as you walk around, but when you finish it and the excitement wears off you realize how small it is.This isn't about being a full-fledged 'episode' in the MGSV title anyway, it's more of a taste of what's to come. It's kinda like the Tanker episode in MGS2 and the first operation before the Boss' betrayal in MGS3. But even shorter than those. Rather than make us wait for MGSV Konami released that prologue as it's own title, at a bargain price (at least on PC).PC version runs smooth as butter, looks somewhere between 'next-gen' and 'late last-gen' (obviously). It's comparable to night-time in Sleeping Dogs, only with slightly better textures and effects.If you're a MGS fan you'll probably do the collectibles in the map. There are 7 or so tapes to be found, XOF Tags that need searching, and some side-missions that have you using the turret and rescuing people on the island. I'm not complaining, it's MGSV on a small 'trial-island' before the actual game gets released.Get it on sale, don't pay more than 10 dollars unless you're a huge MGS fan.

Is it a prologue? Is it a demo? Is there enough there to warrant a purchase? Well, this question has three different answers depending on what type of person you are:1) Are you a Metal Gear fan? If so, then this game is immediately worth a purchase. There isn't a lot of story in there, but it's all worth experiencing for yourself.2) Are you only interested in MGSV, even though you've never played all of the previous Metal Gear games? Well, you should'nt worry then, because Ground Zeroes is a completely gameplay-driven experience after the initial 2 or so hours it'll take you to complete the main story mission.3) Are you only interested in the main mission? If so, then this game is only worth it if you are okay with spending the money on a 2 hours worth of gameplay.With that out of the way, it's worth mentioning that Ground Zeroes is a surprisingly fantastic PC port. The game always looked pretty on consoles, but the hardware-limitations kept it from reaching it's true height. Now, with sharper textures, much better draw-distance, AA, and shadows, and with the addition of depth-of-field, the game looks so much better.Overall, if you're interested in this game, but not sure if it'll be worth it, then I'd recommend you get it anyways.

76561198085610038,Recommended,311340,13735411,"Posted: 31 December, 2014",all,A Typical Jester,"Hideo Kojima's newest installment to the Metal Gear Solid franchise, ""METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES"" proves big things certainly can come in small packages.Note before I begin: No spoilers regarding the plot will be revealed in this review.The length of the main story for me personally (keeping in mind I didn't explore or go for max-completion) took a measly two hours to complete (which has sparked a lot of controversy). Despite this however, the story in Ground Zeroes is a very strong one, especially considering that the game was designed to inform fans of  the events that occurred before Phantom Pain.A story in a Video Game or Movie however, is only as great as it is visually portrayed, Thankfully, the game looks beautiful. Kojima's previous installment to the series ""Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of Patriots"" was a big step in visuals for its time. In fact, most Metal Games exceed expectations in terms of visuals.  Ground Zeroes is no exception. It has surpassed the visuals of Guns of Patriots by a long shot. The environment, the structures and the other soldiers look incredible.  If you haven't already,  simply watch the first cinematic on Youtube. It doesn't give away too much, but rather gives a small introduction as to what you will be required to do for the mission.  What you see in the first cinematic is a strong representation as to what you can expect from this game in terms of visuals. You will not be let down.Sound quality is also something that you will be amazed by. Most objects/actions you hear is very accurate in comparision to its real world counterpart.Due to the small length of the game, many will argue it is difficult for the player to grow attached to any of the characters at this point in time which I do agree with to some extent. That is something you will have to judge yourself IF you do decide to purchase this game.Another thing to note is that I strongly believe this game appeals towards fans who have played previous installments as opposed to those who begin on this game. It does touch on events and reference Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker which may confuse some players. The game does give a very brief summary of the events that occurred in these titles but one may argue it's not enough.  If you have never played a Metal Gear Solid game do not start on this game. A HD collection was recently released containing both Snake Eater AND Peace Walker along with another popular title. Do yourself a favor and purchase it.Whilst the stealth aspects of this game are great and work incredibly well, veterans will be disappointed to find the lack of new creative methods of concealing yourself. Bushes and shrubs similar to those from Snake Eater were my best friend throughout the story along with the tranq gun. However, I (personally) couldn't find nothing more than that. I may of missed it, but it certainly was not a prominent feature (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).The game does include ""spec-ops"" missions that attempt to extend the overall game time. I personally have not played them at this point in time but do intend on doing so.To summaries, if your interested a beautifully presented stealth (which means not ""runnin' and gunnin"") title WHICH is not too long, Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes will certainly not disappoint.PROS:-BEAUTIFUL VISUALS-FREE OF GAME BREAKING BUGS-SOUND QUALITY IS FANTASTIC-STEALTH MECHANICS...HOWEVER (SEE CON POINT 2)-DRAMATIC AND EXCITING STORYCONS:-TIME TO COMPLETE MAIN STORY IS SMALL-LACKING IN HIDING SPOTS-MANY ARGUE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE-NEWCOMERS MAY NOT UNDERSTAND SOME REFERENCES TO THE EXPECTED EXTENT.Final rating: 4/5.If anyone disagrees with something I have said or is confused on something, feel free to comment."

It makes the game better in a way since you don't have to worry about wether your camo is high enough, you can focus on the task at hand. I can run this on a laptop that isn't high end so it's clearly well made as has been pointed out below.Pros:Different approaches available. The open world and the way you personally handle the mission is up to you and no one else. Sneak or kick the door in, your choice.Tight controls, no longer do you have to wait for Snake to drop to his belly. He does it ASAP.Heard that it would be very short and I beg to differ. It's big enough. It may not be huge, but it's enough.Cons:The guards you treathen with the knife does not talk. I hate that. They did in MGS3. They moan and subtitles appear. They should talk too.Camera makes it a bit hard to see when you are sneaking close to a wall.I miss some movements from older games, like being able to walk along a wall by your own will. Snake goes into cover automtically(which works very well) but I would like to be able to walk along the wall like in Snake Eater, or at the very least like in MGS4, where you press a button to lean against the wall. But I reckon I'll get used to it.That's pretty much it from me. You won't get disappointed. Almost guarantee it."

I'm somewhat of a noob to the series, having only experienced MGS 1-4 via Chip & Ironicus' excellent and informativeLet's Playseries of them, so I'm familiar with the gameplay and story, just never played them myself.Ground Zeroes is a playground. It gives you a bunch of tools and abilities and plops you down in a giant sandbox where you can use those things to your heart's content. This may only be a single prologue map, but the gameplay is deep enough that that's okay. You'll find yourself playing it over and over, doing things in different ways, trying out new things, or just goofing around. There are also alternate missions that change up the objectives as well as weather and time of day, creating a dramatically different looking and feeling game.On the technical side of things, the port is mostly excellent, especially considering it's a Japanese developer, some of whom are still learning how to make a proper PC port (See: Dark Souls 1, Deadly Premonition, Final Fantasy XIII at launch, etc.). But MGS5 has graphics options out the wazoo, arbitrary resolutions, and is incredibly well optimized. On my i7 4770k and HD 7950, I get a constant 60 FPS at 1080p with everything on Extra High except for Shadows and SSAO down a notch to just ""High"". It looks fantastic. The one mark against it is the 60 FPS cap - for someone as obsessed with framerate as Kojima, I would expect him to not artificially limit the framerate. 120 and 144 Hz monitors are becoming increasingly common. It's smooth enough at 60, but worth mentioning.Some people malign this game as ""just paying for a demo of Phantom Pain"", but then this is the most feature-packed, most replayable, most awesome demo ever made, and (as you can see from my play time) I've gotten many hours of entertainment from it.

I am safe to say that the FOX engine is one of the best ""next gen"" engines to be designed, so much love and work has been given to it and it really shows.If you are a fan of the Metal Gear Series this is definetly a must buy, if you're not a fan of the Metal Gear Series, so go play the games, get to know them, and then you'll be temped to buy this for sure.

Ground Zeroes offers a 2 hour experience for the average player, and also includes some Side Ops that could round your playtime to around 4 hours if you complete them. The 2 hour story is amazing, and one of the best stories that I have played in recent times. That said, it is rather short.The game leaves you on a cliffhanger, so don't buy it expecting a full game.  It is larglely overpriced, but if you are a fan of the games and haven't played in a long time (Last game I played was Peace Walker) then this will fill your hype for The Phantom Pain.It was a good idea to put this in with The Phantom Pain, since it includes a backstory which helps you understand what is going on if you haven't played Peace Walker.The games mechanics themselves are very smooth, especially with mouse and keyboard. I used my Mouse and Keyboard for this game and preferred it to the controller. It is a stealth game, but if you mess up it doesn't punish you too hard. Completing the game on normal is a slight challenge, but still not excruciating.I haven't attempted the game on Hard, since I am pleased with what I got and have no wish to play through again.The stealth mechanics can be a little wonky at times, for example trying to move between 2 barricades will have you switching cover rather than actually moving through, but it is acceptable. It doesn't happen very often.The PC port in terms of graphics options was fantastic. I have no reason to put it higher than high, but with my GTX 660 it runs at a constant 60fps. Might have dipped to 59 during a cutscene but that doesn't matter.There is one thing that irked me upon starting the game, and that was the lack of a SINGLE audio slider present. That's right. You have to go into Volume Mixer (Windows users) to lower the volume of this game.Please be aware of this, since the game is very loud. Take your headphones off before you start the game, and then lower the volume using Volume Mixer.Not much else to say here, but this game is a solid 8/10.Can't wait for The Phantom Pain!"

Yet the whole package is simply not worth 20€ because essentially it contains just one map with different variations.It is a shame that Konami didn't put this title in a much better price range, because otherwise, Ground Zeroes plays extremely well both in terms of gameplay mechanics and optimization. The graphics are superb, the controls are snappy and smooth, and the framerate stays at 60 fps constantly. This is an exceptionally good port that other developers must need to take a note of. Just look at those system requirements for a game that comes out in 2015!The only gripe I have with the game is that Kojima decided to use audio recordings instead of cutscenes to deliver more exposition and background information about the story. Sure, the previous installments of the series contained sometimes needlessly long cutscenes and verbose dialogue but at least you had the chance to watch something interesting while receiving this information. In this case, you just listen to audio recordings and that's pretty much it. We've seen it elsewhere a thousand times before, so this is a clear step back in the storytelling department. I sure hope the tapes won't be overused in The Phantom Pain.Overall, Ground Zeroes is definitely worth your time even if you are new to the Metal Gear franchise.

As someone who's played a few of the MGS games (including MGS3, Portable Ops, Peace Walker, and MGS1 itself), I can definitely say this series has never been better. Get hyped for The Phantom Pain.

Mood,"Ran real well on my medium-high end craptop (settings mostly set to high and still ran great without any problems) and just downright played great on keyboard & mouse (except for the movement when trying to turn around and when you try to choose some options while you have someone in a chokehold. You have to hold one key to enter interrogation [default: Q] and while you're holding said key you have to press another key with the same hand to choose a dialogue option [default: 1, 2, 3] which can be straining to many).When trying to lean against some small cover (while crouching especially) Snake tends to put his head out just enough for anything on the other side to see which can be highly detremental for those just attempting to touch a surface of, for example, a small box. When that happens even trying to back your body out of sight can be difficult as Snake also tends to get his whole body out of cover.The sensitivy for aiming in first person mode is way too high even when set to the lowest it can go in the options menu, which can highly affect perfect shots with snipers when looking through the lense or even just using the binoculars without looking too far off somewhere. A controller is much more recommended for these moments.It's a third-person shooter when you let it become a shooter (which is unrecommended and isn't the initial point but that's the player's choice).The guns work really well here; they spread quite a bit if you hold down the trigger too long (as with most other shooters) and there's bullet drop which is much more noticeable with the sniper and the tranquilizer gun.It's a wonderful stealth game with incredible AI where the enemy can spot you immediately if you're seen close enough to them, though if you're far enough from view they'll just check out whatever unusual thing that was in the distance. If you're in view for too long too far away they'll ""check out a suspected individual"" or ""check out something suspicious going on."" Close enough to them and you're in view for too long they'll recognize you, set the whole area to combat status, and start engaging immediately (unless you neutralize them fast enough and if they're alone before they set the entire island into combat status) which you can then run and hide until the heat wears off or shoot back until you're in the clear, though reinforcements usually keep coming if theynoticethat their live soldier count is dwindling. You can also experiment with how you can be sneaky in this game (ie: get most of the solders's attention away from your goal by detonating a C4 to destroy an AA gun that was placed really far away from where you're going).There are just so many great things in this game that I most likely still haven't even squeezed out despite my tons of hours and completion rate into it. This is one of those games I think where learning on your own what you can do with what you have to help get you from A to B is part of the joy and fun. As stated many times in many other places though, the only big negative thing about this is that it's pretty much a demo: it's too short for a full priced game. For fans and just the right people this is an incredible piece to have and play."

Also, to anyone else who was having trouble with your controller, try waiting to plug it in to your computer until the game gets to the main menu.Graphics-9/10Foxengine is incredibly beutiful, and will run well on anything.Length-8/10Short, but sweet, and makes you excited for Phantom Pain. Plus, the Extras and Side Ops add a lot of replayability.Sound-9/10All characters, even guards, sound great. Kiefer Sutherland is no Hayter, but he does a surprisingly good job as Big Boss. Gun sounds are crisp, and music is amazing.Gameplay-8/10Great controls and everything feels great. However, the cover system is not great and you often pop out in front of a guard when you don't mean to. Also sometimes guards can see you through stuff. Gunplay is a little strange, but it should be, as it isn't a shooter, it's a stealth game. You didn't see great gunplay in SC: Chaos Theory, and that's one of the greatest stealth games of all time.OVERALL-8.5/10I would reccomend this game to any Metal Gear fan, or fans of stealth games in general. This definitely goes up there with Chaos Theory and Mark of the Ninja as one of my all time favorite stealth games. If you haven't played a Metal Gear game before, however, I'm not sure if you would like ths however.I absolutely can't wait for Phantom Pain.

Game's mission was showing players new Fox Engine and how real game The Phantom Pain will be. Well we can say Ground Zeroes succeeded.Pros:+ Story is of course not detailed as old MGS games (because of 1-2 hours long story mission) but it's good.+ Gameplay is freaking awesome. Controls, stealth elements are really good and gameplay is sooo tactical.+ Because of tactical gameplay game has a high replay value.+ Graphics are really really good. Well game was looking very good on PS4 but on PC... It looks gorgeous.+ Optimization's amazing. Other developers should take notes from this game's optimization.+ Enemy AI is one of the bests i've ever seen.Cons:- Even for a prologue game's too short.- Because of main mission being too short game has only few chracters. Most of them are from old games, GZ only introduced one new character to the series.- I don't know is this game really considers as an open world, but game's map is too small and has got only few interesting things to explore.- Like I said gamplay is amazing but it has one flaw: There's too little guns - items to use."

For the price though, I would say it's worth it (I say this during a sale).A word of caution: Even though the game runs incredibly well, the options in the options menu have negligible performance benefit. Either it runs or it doesn't, changing settings won't take it from 20 to 60 no matter what you do.

I choose to prone on the wooden floor which my enemies somehow fail to penetrate even after 30 seconds of constant firing. At this point they decide cease firing, with the conclusion that they've ""lost  visual with the target"".

Provides a nice little back story for MGSV as it was intended to do.Getting into the MGS franchise for the first time? This could be the ideal and cheaper game to start you off on if your heart is set on conquering MGSV - the controls and feel are the same as its sequel.Definately worth owning and playing.

Tough I would not call it a complete game, it is fun while it lasts.ContentThe content is streched over one entire map, making the scenery somewhat redundant. Fortunatly, there are several different side or special ops next to the ""canon"" story. I would say the game gets better, the more you play it, since you get more content to play around with. Just like a big sandbox.The Storyline is plausible and compelling, yet falls too short. Extra content for all players, who look closer and keep their eyes open for possible secrets!GraphicsGraphics looks awesome and the game runs smoothly, even on my 4 year old machine.Sound & MusicMusic is typically ""Metal Gear""-esque and very fitting, thrilling and emotional.ControlsThe controls are a little disorienting at first, but you get used to it very fast. Since I am a mouse & keyboard player, I cannot rate the controls on a controller.WeakpointsThe price is a little too steep for it (considering its just one location). Get this game either as a gift or when on sale. Also, sometimes DOF is not working how its supposed to be, camera angles might be confusing at certain times. An issue which was probably carried over from Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance.Concluding ThoughtsOverall, an awesome game. Reminds me of the good old ""Splinter Cell""-Days, but with more possibilities to approach your targets. More please!Awesome Prequel. Little too short for its price. Game is very nicely optimized (as expected). Runs smooth, even on older machines. Gameplay is intuitive and easy to adapt to. Weird camera-angles sometimes. No Bugs (!). Additional content. Replayable. Fun to get in or back to. Plan ahead, execute. Don't let yourself get seen. Remember, this is a stealth mission."

And now, the average PC gamer can have that.Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is a short 2-3 hour game depending on how you play. That being said, no two experiences will be exactly the same.

No, not♥♥♥♥♥♥Creed, a whole new breed of it. Enemies can be anywhere at any time, so mark your targets.MGSV is also running on Kojima's new FOX Engine, which is an incredibly incredible engine that optimizes the game to your system better than any other engine I know of. You can say Source, but Source has better physics. FOX runs great, even on a crappy laptop, you wont drop to 3 frames per second randomly when you look at a large open area.My experience with GZ is unhealthy. Ive played it far too much and can just about get all the lines right from memory. ""Here's To You"" is stuck in my head. The game is worth replaying when youre bored or have nothing better to do, since you can play the game multiple ways.I wont explain the story, its not that hard to follow.

I absolutely despise theRestriction this puts on player freedom and as far as I am concerned its ♥♥♥♥ing lazy dev♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that restricts players movement, playstyle and risk and reward based play.I am a player who loves stealthy approaches. I will do a part in a game over 50 times if Ihave to in order to get the mission to go how I want it to. That is just me that is howI play and how I enjoy games personally. I love getting in and getting out without anyone knowing I was ever there. Hence titles like Dishonored, Deus Ex and Thief were anabsolute joy. They allowed the player to try different things over and over again with thequicksave button to get the result they want. That is how I like to play.Metal Gear Solid does not allow this. The stealth mechanics and game mechanics are solidand enjoyable, the graphics are quite nice. The over all game is solid and enjoyable.Memorizing guard patterns finding a new way into a base its all great. The weapons areclunky (and improved in MSG5) but the overall experience is a good one. HOWEVER thecheck point system is a pile of rancid♥♥♥♥♥♥ I had to play several sequences over about30-50 times to no get caught by random Guard RnG or some other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that limitedhow I wanted to play. I lost a 40 minute segment of gameplay in which I was undetectedand had to spend hours on recreating because of one screw up. This is not fun. I wasforced to do this sequence over and over again because I wanted the gameplay to beindicative of MY playstyle not what the developer wanted or was too lazy to think outside the box for.I am sure I will hear a lot of learn to play etc, you are not supposed to play like thatwell I couldn't care less. This is my opinion of the game. I hate MSG5 for the exactsame reasons. Checkpoints are gameplay limiting and cancer for player choice andfreedom.Despite me nearly rage quitting and uninstalling the game and promptly deleting the gamefrom my steam library forever I will mention a bit more from an objective point of view.The experience in Ground Zeroes is short. It only involves one map/base. There is a shortstory sequence that leads into MSG5. So if you must know what happens or if you are newto Metal Gear I'd probably recommend it. For about 3-5 dollars. Its basically a techdemo for MSG5. This game is not worth even 10 dollars because its not enough of a game.If you are hardcore fan sure get it, because you will probably love every second of it.For those others who are new, its not necessary but an enjoyable introduction to thefranchise IF you can deal with checkpoint frustration. I personally was barely able to.That being said this is a cautious recommendation on the cheap."

It costs as much as the TPP base game, so there'e no reason not to get the definitive edition over either of the games.-----The atmosphere and level design is so much better in Ground Zeroes than in the Phantom Pain though, and I wish there were more maps like these in TPP as opposed to a bunch of similar looking bases.

Camp Omega area is super small, even ""the admin building"" is not a building but a box, and you don't ""go inside"" but around the walls.There are serious gameplay issues:• Turning auto-compensation / bad movement transitions: BB does additional movements that are not requested by user (This is especially embarrassing since MGS1 is known for its fluid controls and sharp turning). In a stealth game [especially of The Stealth Franchise] it makes a difference between successful manoeuvre or mission failure• Wall sticking is replaced by clunky cover mechanic. Now BB tends to clumsily stick out of cover, wall throws/shots are almost impossible because line of sight is obscured while BB manages to stick out and be seen by enemies• Bullet replenishment on save's reload. And that in the series that is known for putting player in interesting tactical situations, like having 3 bullets and empty mag for 7 enemies. Blasphemy !• Aggressive health regeneration• Enemies lie down indefinitely on the ground with their rifles beside them (that's just silly)• Enemy telepathy & ""reflex mode"" instead of great MGS2 alert system• Magazines are infinite• You can't ""cook"" grenades or throw them slow and under or, better yet, control the arc (see Syphon Filter 1-3 for great example)• Kaz never shuts the ♥♥♥♥ up on replay• Konami hasn't bothered to put sword gameplay in Raiden's mission or update models for MGS1-styled missionSome upsetting technical deficiencies:• Camera is too shaky• Geometry clipping• Knocked out enemies and POWs sometimes disappear and suddenly reappear• Mouse sensitivity for aiming is not adjustable and too big• Additional mouse buttons are not recognized• DOF is insanely overblown• Critical settings like AA, DOF and exact level of filtering are not clearly exposed• LOD changes are too visible• PC version doesn't have ""music import"" even thought Steam has it's own music library nowMoreover, it has story inconsistencies too:• Disastrous lack of cutscenes and dialogues• How Snake can be ""formerly known as Big Boss"" if in the ending of PW (that GZ starts almost immediately after) he ordered to be called like that ?• Paz's name is incorrect, it should be ""Pacifica Ocean""• There can't be ""no time for anaesthetic"", the only thing they needed is a quick morphine injection, but then cutscene wouldn't be so dramatic• A ♥♥♥♥♥♥-bomb ? Seriously ?! (see South Park ""The Snuke"" episode and ""24"" series)• Runaway prisoner has a bag on his head. How the hell he got away and successfully hidden ?"

Answer is: one location; one story mission; about 3-4 optional missions based on the same map, but featuring other objectives; some stuff that may introduce you to MGS story - 11 pages of MGS Peace Walker story, audio records with character' dialogues(MGS story is really damn huge, so you will be lost if you never played any MGS game before);Map is some US military base on Cuba, it's kinda small. This location features: truck, jeep and APC to try out vehicles in MGS series; some soldiers to try out upgraded CQC system and weapons.It's not much, you can finish story mission in about a hour or two and then maybe make it no more than 10 hours doing other missions on the same little map.So, this is basicly demonstration of gameplay mechanics in MGS V which is going to be [/b]first open world game in franchise[/b].Also there is an option to upload save data to cloud and use it later in Phantom Pain, so actions in this ""game"" matter somehow or will be rewarded.As a result: you can buy it or you can skip it, doesn't matter that much.

In Metal Gear Solid 5 Ground Zeroes we play as Big Boss. Were tasked to retrieve to agents Chico and Paz after the Peace Walker incident. So how is this game ? Well this is alot of fun but first of all i have to say this for the people. THIS IS A INTRODUCTION FOR THE MAIN GAME which is Phantom Pain which will come out later and not its own game. Think of it as a demo before the full project comes out. But overall this is still alot of fun. The game feels like a true MGS game should. Stealth in this game is really fun and fluid and without a doubt this game is smooth as hell. Stealth in this game works so well its always youre fault if you get spotted. The port is also outstanding. Maxed out i got a solid 60 without ever getting a single drop. There isnt many things that are bad about this game. Some Minor bugs there and there but nothing major. The game is really fun and if youre a fan of MGS definetly do not skip this title and get it right away. I give Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes a 8/10

The idea of rescuing Paz didn't make me so happy.If you're just playing this for the main mission then honestly, just look up a youtube video or something. The story of this mission isn't exactly all that important. At least get it on sale if you're determined to play through to see what happens.The game has a decent amount to offer if you are interested in side missions, collectibles, trials, and those sorts of things. I don't normally go for all the achievements in games, but I decided to on this one which took me a bit under 30 hours to accomplish. Having spent only $5 on the game, it feels worth it to me.Gameplay itself feels smooth. The two difficulties feel appropriately challenging. Gunplay is refined and satisfying. There are a lot of different approaches to missions. If you want to go loud and have a huge firefight as you do the missions then you can, or you can stealthily kill people, or simply sneak around and not kill anyone at all. It's pretty fun to experiment diffierent ways of tackling objectives. The grade you get on a level will unlock more weapons to start out with for the next time you play through that mission. Having access to different guns can change how you deal with enemies and targets.Honestly, I'm surprised I put as much time into this as I did.

,Recommended,311340,13529001,"Posted: 22 December, 2014",all,Akkere,"Let me start off with this: This is probably the best port I've ever played in my life. By that, I mean there's pretty much no optimization problems. It runs like butter. I point this out, because for the past few months, PC Gaming has had a mean streak with ports (a lot of them coming from our favorite publisher, Ubisoft) in which potentially good or bad games are immediately hampered with frames per second rates so bad I feel like I'm playing a stop motion film. It's almost like Kojima saw this, and thought ""It's time"", and released this to show that ""Hey, Phantom Pain is still coming to PC, and we're not going to drop the ball on this. Don't believe us? Check this out."" And for that, I'm very happy.Onto the actual game: This is the infamous ""2-hour game for $20"", originally going to be priced at $30. Take that what you will. People will argue that it has a fantastic replayability, and it does, it really does, but that doesn't necessary take away from the fact that the actual story campaign is very minimal and doesn't quite contribute as much as it should have. We came here with a dozen questions, and left with a hundred more.That being said, the brief time I've played this game on just the main mission has been incredible simply for how flexible everything plays out. Say you wanted to do a completely non-lethal approach on a mission.And then there's the side-ops. These are missions that don't take you to a new map, mind you, but give you different kinds of objectives to approach. Kill a guy here, retrieve some intel there, etc. There's even a nice not-so-little cameo appearance from our favorite Japanese video game director.In my opinion, to get through all the content in and outside of the main mission, it will take you longer than 2 hours, especially if you want to try experimenting with different playthroughs or want to achieve S rank in everything. It would be much better if the side-ops were integrated more into the main story rather than just non-canon side quests like the way they are now, but it's something of a very small sample to what Phantom Pain is going to turn out to be, and the future looks bright.Overall, Ground Zeroes proves to be a phenomenal prologue that gives a lot of hope for the main entry, in which we'll see Big Boss in his transformation stages to the villanous character of the early Metal Gear games.It's also the only game where you can't have Snake smoke during a mission. 0/10."

Aside from the rather clunky keyboard driven menus, everything else is of the highest and smoothest quality. The map is the star here. It feels alive. Just large and intricate enough to make mission 1 feel daunting, but small enough to learn after completing a few more missions. Player movement is smooth as silk, with seamlessly linking animations to perform maneuvers. The gameplay is stealth done right. Clear and intuitive visual queues make it all work. You have the tools to sneak smartly, but if things get out of control, the gunplay is tight and can save you. In fact, in one mission I was advised to go in guns a'blazin and it was sweet action.

In case you're wondering, GOTY 2014 for me was Wolfenstein: The New Order.In my mind this is a complete return to what made MGS 1-3 so fantastic. 4, while great in it's own way, was largely a playable movie with a bit of gameplay thrown in. Ground Zeroes has almost as much gameplay as 4 if you do all of the side missions and challenges so don't believe the rumors that there isn't much to this. Replayability is huge, take the time to train for Phantom Pain with some of the new features, because I found about a dozen ways to beat each mission and had an absolute blast doing it.The ambience, gun control, stealth mechanics and general visual appeal of Ground Zeroes was near flawless for me. I love stealth games in general with MGS being my all time favorite franchise so I can be very picky about how it's done.I'd love to see a little bit more consideration given to challenge timers for those of us who feel the need to kill enemies now and then. I love to do complete stealth runs of all types and I thoroughly enjoy the pacifist approach, but a challenge timer for simply getting in and out without being detected would be fantastic.

Imagine they invite you to write a review of an awesome high quality restaurant: you're arriving ten minutes early, haven't eaten anything for the whole day, anticipating something incredible. And they give you incredible - just one spoon.So, in attempt to review Ground Zeroes you immediately face a dilemma: either review the actual content in the amount and quality provided, or the grand and unarguably superb mechanics, which this one mission is only giving a slight taste of. There's no real argument around the actual game - it's phantastic, and MGS V is promising to be on of the best experiences in stealth/action genre so far, not even mentioning dark and depressive story, even for Kodjima (some audio tapes in Ground Zeroes depicting torture and♥♥♥♥♥♥provide various hints to that).The spoon is perfect, but that's just a spoon. However good the game is, it is objectively not worth even $20 that're being asked for it. For $5 though it's definitely a steal.

(TL;DR is included at the bottom of this review)Right off the bat, this game is short content wise and that may turn off certain people, but trust me the replayability of all 7 missions is amazing. Each mission differs with objectives, but not area as the whole game takes place in a Cuban military base, but the level design of said base is astonishing. Every time you replay any of the missions it feels as if another route or way to execute said missions is found, creating a sense of longevity to the game that is hard to find in games.The main mission resorts around the finding and rescuing of two hostages and can easily be done in a speed run in 10 minutes. You might be saying at this time ""10 MINUTES!?!?! That doesn't justify a £16.00 price tag!"" But trust me, you won't me finishing the first mission within that time. Not even on your 2nd 3rd or 4th time. You'll start to quicky understand the many different ways of dealing with situations which the game throws at you. Suddenly you've spent 2-3 hours doing a mission that, if executed with extreme accuracy, can be done in under 10 minutes! This gives you a strong reason of replaying the main mission. Everytime you do, the game gives you a score. The highest score possible is a S-Rank which even I'm struggling to get 34.1 hours into the damn thing!The other 4 missions, labled as 'Pseudo-Historical Recreations' are centered on all sorts of different objectives from eliminating 2 targets to protecting a very 'special' undercover agent whilst shooting from a hellicopter. The last 2 'Deja Vu' and 'Jamais Vu' are obtained when all 9 XOF Patches are found within the game, this also creates another reason to go back and play the game because the 2 missions are filled with cameos and nostalgic moments that are pretty awesome.You really need to play the game just to get a feel of how amazing the game mechanics are. It feels responsive and fast, with everything just feeling so damn satisfying! Like I said, it really needs to be seen first hand just to be respected!With all that being said, the port is absolutley amazing! Running at a smooth 60FPS on high graphics settings, the game looks beautiful! The required graphical settings for all PC games are there in detail. You can really tell that Konami finally know how to make an almost perfect PC port and I'm excited to see how well they do Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain!So, for a TL;DR,PROS- Amazing port with all of the settings you'd expect for a PC game. One of the best ports out there!- Slick controls with amazing gameplay that is in a class of it's ow- The replayability is astonishing with endless ways to execute all 7 different missions- The graphics are absolutley breathtaking, running at 60FPS 1080P is incredible. And, if your rig can handle it, 4K with 60FPS. This game showcases what 'Next Gen' means!CONS- Some people may find the game somewhat short, with a lot more to be desired.FINAL VERDICT... 9.5/10The great Kojima has made us PC player wait for this game, but the wait was worth every second! An absolutely brilliant port! Now we all have to patiently wait for MGS V: TPP, and I'm pretty sure that that's going to be three times as good as this!Do yourself a huge favour, BUY THIS GAME!"
,Recommended,311340,14320797,"Posted: 3 February, 2015",all,Vaineguardio,"I'm a huge Metal Gear Solid fan but I was skeptical about the port to steam since, let's face it, many console ports haven't made a smooth transition to pc as of late but Kojima definitely ensured a quality port that actually ends up feeling like its native platform was pc to begin with.Mouse and keyboard support is spot on! the keys are mapped in a very intuitive way, keys are also stream lined so that several keys share different functions rather than having to contort a finger reaching for some ridiclous punctuation key. Most console ports have been plagued with mouse smoothing (which can't be disabled in some cases) but right from the get-gp the mouse is precise and responsive, unfortunately there is no mouse support in the menus but meh, that's really a small nit pick.Anyone complaining that Ground Zeroes doesn't pack a lot of content is sorely mistaken. The main campaign takes at least an hour for skilled players to complete on normal difficulty (far more if you try to accomplish challenges and play on hard difficulty) plus there is a slew of side missions. All in all this ""demo"" as people call it can easily run you 30 to 40 hours of gameplay, which isn't too shabby for the price.Either way Ground Zeroes accomplishes what it sets out to do in the first place: It makes me want Metal Gear Solid 5 The Phantom Pain far more than I already did to begin with so hurry the **** up already Kojima!

The main story mission can be completed from anywhere from 45 minutes to 4-8 hours, and after that you're given a set of missions in the same map, that brilliantly showcases how the scenario changes from where you approach, and what objectives you have in the map. The game revolves a lot around reconing the area first, to find the optimal ways of approach. Once you see the enemies, they're tagged and can be tracked more easily. The game has a new ""reflex-mode"" that can be turned off. Basically, it enables Snake to have a couple of seconds in slow motion to dismiss of the enemies before they sound the alarm and start shooting."

I have three versions of this game (PS3, PS4, and PC), and this is the best of them all. Runs without a hitch on my PC, and even on my brother's lower spec PC flawlessly. It's a pretty amazing port. Lighting effects and draw distance are a drastic difference even from the PS4.Now, how about the actual game itself? The gameplay is extremely solid, if a bit easy. Great stealth mechanics with AI that can actually see for once. Good controls aside from the awkward cover system. Camera is smooth and only gets in the way when you're cramped against a wall while aiming. Damage is extremely forgiving, and regenerating health takes away a lot from the game (regen health in a stealth game is a big no-no), but aside from this, gameplay-wise it's pretty much perfect.Now, for the story, this is the most disappointing Metal Gear title out there. Little to no real plot revelations are in this game. The ""story"" moves way too fast, and you get no real sense of attachment unless you spent hours grinding on Peace Walker and listened to all of the tapes (which is a good 30 hours). Big Boss for some reason is mute, and when he does talk, Kiefer's snake is one of the most bored soldiers out there. The only competent character in the entire 30-40 minute long tech demo is Kaz Miller (played us like a damn fiddle guy). He says just enough to add to the overall character of Kaz. Also, all of the ""controversial"" elements are nothing to write home about, though the themes they try to portray are good themes, it's all done so poorly that I didn't really care about them.In all, Ground Zeroes is a fun chunk of a much larger game sold at half the price of said game. I'm a huge (huge) Metal Gear fan, and I was let down by this release. Do I still recommend it? Yes. Each of the bonus missions are fun, and after a few times through you're likely to get a solid 5-6 hours with Ground Zeroes if you aren't a completionist (which is about the norm for a $60 shooter campaign).+ Amazing graphics. Character models are amazing detailed, and cutscenes are slickly produced.+ Near-perfect gameplay.+ Fun missions!+ Unlockables and leaderboards extend gameplay life.+ Kaz and Big Boss being played like a damn fiddle.- Big Boss is the most emotionless soldier on the planet at this point.- Destruction of motherbase is a slap in the face to the hours of grinding on Peace Walker. All that work gone in a 2 minute cutscene with no real emotional impact.- Regenerating health and generally easy difficulty.- Short.- Makes me worried that Phantom Pain will have the same drab emotionless tone as this, which I hope isn't the case.Conclusion:Pick it up on a sale unless you're the completionist type, in which you'll get 20+ hours huntil down everything. Great gameplay, but not very much of it. Story is the worst this series has to offer so far, which is a huge disappointment in a series where story is literally 75% or more of the games."

Quick Jump, quick rolling => all useful in stealth* You can have different forms of firing position in prone* The idroid is so useful since you can call in some support from the MSF :3* Guns are awesome as well* Ai is good, and another nice additions is that they coordinate their atk based on your last known position. They even go out in groups to search you in the area.Map & Graphics:* Graphics is excellent; The FOX engine reallys makes the game look photo realistic :D* There is only 1 map :( BUT it has a nice design tho theres some hidden ways to infiltrate the base* There are some objects that can be interacted with such as cutting the power line down; Manning turrets; driving cars and tanks; breaking in supply rooms; etc.Overall: SCORE = (8.8/10)- One map, but has 6 side quest and easter eggs.- AWESOME STORY !- Great Stealth and Action#AHideoKojimaGame :D"

Do you want to feel like a reconnaissance or special operative, who is solo missioning behind enemy lines? Then look no further! Play as Big Boss, the infamous villain of Metal Gear series that was once a hero but turned rogue because his country abandoned him. Play the time before David Hayter/Solid Snake took the field and became the legendary soldier that bested even Big Boss himself.This is a prologue, reason why it is shorter compared to anything Kojima has ever put out, beside this fatal flaw then the game is a masterpiece of it's genre.

The gameplay is brilliant but the story tops the cake off the icing. Unfortunately, the story is put into ""tapes"" and ""clues"" to understand what is going on, diviating from casual gamers who just want to be in the middle of everything. A clear sign of how Metal Gear cuts away the long cutscenes that it had in all it's series because of the critical acclaim from critics that hates cutscenes so much but never took into account that the gameplay of all of Metal Gear excluding NES, was innovative and new at the time or even mind blowing if just giving it some serious thought. All I can say is, that I miss the old codec phone in method. I do hope the easy method of none codec will not cross over to Phantom Pain.Beside that, this game is a short reminder of what to come and it's a masterpiece that leaves you with a heavy cliffhanger that makes you want to break your keyboard because the main story takes around 1 hour and 30 minutes while doing plenty of stuff around the single map that exist out there."

It's good old MGS but in a new skin and with modern controls, in some way inspired by Splinter Cell, but at the same time retaining all the classic elements of the franchise.The main mission, Ground Zeroes, is the prequel to the Phantom Pain, the Side Ops are extra missions that offer a more clear understanding of the different situation we will probably encounter in the full game release and finally theres a whole lot of collectibles and unlockables that altogether will extend the playtime considerably. The Deja Vu mission is in my opinion the most amazing tribute to the original MGS and a must play for any of its fans, it'll bring back some memories.All of this takes place in the same map, although at different times of the day. Most of this extra stuff is unneccessary busy work in my opinion, but others might enjoy the challenge.There are a few problems, though. The mouse+keyboard controls are fiddly and clearly a mere remap of the controller's (which the game is obviously designed for), the mouse movement doesn't scale when zooming in and that makes sniping a chore. The use of the same key for contextual actions screwd me over countless times, the cover system will make you snap to cover automatically at the wrong times and sometimes get you spotted. Also, I've been in situations where enemies would spot me through a wall and the AI may be a little inconsistent at times. All of these seem problems that can be resolved by the time TPP comes out (fingers crossed).The overall opinion is that Ground Zeroes isn't a ""prologue"" like they advertised it, more likely a glorified demo, but a good one at that. I recommend to pick it up for $10 or less."

Lots of cliffhangers and pokes at the full game. Makes more sense if you've played Peacewalker (psp), but has a short visual novel sort of thing to bring you up to speed.This game plays like a damn fiddle. Smooth gameplay and stealth mechanics, great voicework and attention to overal detail and TONS of replayability make this game a semi-worthy buy.BUT WAIT THERE BE CONS!:short- can be overlooked because of extra content, secrets and general replayability, but still frustrating.CONTROLS- It seems that controls were overlooked pretty hard during the conception of the pc port. Many keys are... odly placed(example: to turn your flashlight on/off you have to push 'L' while aiming [LMB])... and some menu aspects could've been modified to better suit the PC environment. The menus, pulled up by pressing TAB (acceptable) can only be navigated with keyboard control, and even clunkier, require the use of the 1 & 3 keys to opperate.Overall, these things can be rebinded and once again, can be overlooked to a certain degree.-Weapons swapping etc.:Potentially my biggest gripe about the game, the menu system that is used to swap weapons is unforgivably complicated and uselessly hard to use wtih Kb&M controls. When rebinding there is a key you can hold to access a weapon 'wheel' sort of thing, but it requires use of the arrow keys. I do not understand why this has to be so complicated.Alot of tips during loading screens also are only listed for controller keys, so half the time they arent very helpful.9/10 its gr8 m8, optomized pretty well, looks pretty pretty, menu navigation is utter and absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ but overall is bareable.I dont write reviews.

Hideo Kojima has been releasing games under the Metal Gear franchise each of them getting critical acclaim from gamers and critics. The man knows how to tell a story and how to set up a good game without a doubt. Sadly, I haven't played any of them since I grew up with Xbox and when I got my PC it turns out the only MGS game out there was this one and none of the previous titles, and I wanted to do so before I played any of the games.. I could pick up the HD rereleases on my Xbox 360, yeah, but I'm kind of too lazy to go out to GameStop to do it, so yeah. But I watched the trailer for Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and I was impressed. So I preordered it the day before it came out, which got me a pretty interesting documentary piece before it and this game. MGSV Ground Zeroes. I thought about getting this game a while back, but the Angry Joe review kind of turned me off from it. But since I got it, I figured why the hell not play it? So how was it? Well, let's get into it.STORY: The year is 1975. Snake is sent into Camp Omega, an American black site on Cuban soil, to extract two people: Paz, a double agent who has worked with Snake, and Chico, a small boy who Snake is training. I'd go into details of it a bit, but I don't really want to spoil much. The story is pretty freaking good, though it is short. Like, really short. I, as someone who isnt that good at stealth games, beat the game in 45 minutes. I heard of guys beating the main game in six minutes. That is... unimpressive, lets say.GAMEPLAY: From what I know, this is the usual MGS gameplay style. Snake carries a silenced assault rifle and a sleep dart pistol at first, though as you play through you unlock more weapons. I'd highly recommend stealth for this game, at least the main mission, though both ways at playing are fun. Gunplay works well enough, and stealth is decent. If you're detected by an enemy, you go into a reflex mode, which slows down time and lets you take the guy out before he alerts the whole base. This saved me a lot of times, but if you dont think you'd enjoy it you can turn it off. The gameplay overall works well, I have to admit.GRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCE: Holy crap this game looks good. I run this game on Medium and I am still really impressed by them. Water reflects off the character's clothing, the lighting is impressive on the main night map and all the other ones, the landscape of the base is nice, overall the game looks great. Plays well, too. Framerate is playable even on my crappy rig, and it's optimized well.CHARACTERS AND VOICE ACTING: Snake is voiced by Keifer Sutherland instead of the guy who played him before, David Hayter. I think it's a decent replacement, he does a good job as Snake. The other characters are well voice acted as well, Tara Strong as Paz is good, that kid who plays Chico, I forget his name and I'm too lazy to look it up, he did good, Miller's voice actor does good, overall it's good. Character design is nice too and the characters overall are decent.EXTRAS: You unlock extra challenges when you beat the main game, which put you back into the base and have you do a specific task, like kill some people or save a prisoner. They add a bit of length to the game, and the fact that Hideo Kojima himself is in one of these is amazing, they're kind of underwhelming. You unlock cassettes throughout these modes which explain some backstory and there are little badges that you can collect around the map. These will buff out the already unimpressive gametime, but ah well, it doesn't matter.FINAL VERDICT: This is basically a five dollar prologue to an epic game sold initially as a $40 full release. Granted they put it down to $30, and the Steam release is down to $20 now, but still, I don't think it's worth it for $20 necessarily. The game goes on sale for $5 often enough, so pick it up then. Maybe see if you can get it alongside The Phantom Pain. Regardless, 8.5/10, it's good for what it is. If you're getting MGS5, pick this up alongside it and play it beforehand. It's a decent enough game and it sets up things to happen in The Phantom Pain. Otherwise, wait for it to go on sale."
76561197970739339,Recommended,311340,20989873,"Posted: 6 February, 2016",all,Captain Chaos,"There's not a whole hell of a lot I can say about Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, especially since I played it only after a good two or three days into The Phantom Pain. I got it on the cheap, which is what you should also do if you're looking to get it still. There's two ways to look at GZ, at least from where I'm standing, and it looks like both: A paid tech demo for the FOX engine, and the gut-wrenching prologue to TPP. Really, when TPP came out this game should have been folded into it and anyone who owned it should have gotten a discount towards it, but this is Konami we're talking about.Ground Zeroes plot follows directly on from Peace Walker, and if you haven't played that game or indeed any Metal Gear, you're not going to have any idea what's going on, but here's the basics: You are Big Boss, legendary former special forces operative turned mercenary leader.  You are on an infiltration mission to a US military blacksite in Cuba, in search of a double agent who betrayed you, and a captured comrade who went looking for that same agent.Things kind of go downhill from there. GZ introduces the player to the mechanics they will be seeing in Phantom Pain, though it is noticeably rougher around the edges. Going from TPP to this game as I did was not pleasant in this regard, especially losing the Fulton system, and it is annoying to see that issues i have to deal with in the later title, such as the complete inability to use the mouse for the buttons in the iDroid, were present here and not addressed prior to the release of TPP. It is also considerably more ponderous to switch between weapons of the same category here. While both of these games represent an unprecedented step forward in the messy history of console games ported to PC, in terms of optimization, controls, and PC-specific settings, there is a long way to go yet. Still, the smooth camera control, aiming, and player movement are all here, as is the godsent ""reflex mode"" that allows you to enter bullet time when spotted and neutralize the spotter before they can raise an alarm, as well as a fairly forgiving checkpoint system and the removal of series-mainstay infinite enemy respawns. Gone are the days of MGS4, where I would ♥♥♥♥ up stealth just once and be forced to shoot my way through the rest of each level, hideously maiming my score and ranking. The checkpoints are actually more forgiving here then in Phantom Pain, even.After completing the relatively short, simple and, notably ONLY, story mission in the game, you unlock access to a series of four ""Side Ops"" missions, including a glorious rail-shooter level where you give a certain bespectacled game designer-slash-intelligence operative fire support from a helicopter. If you collected nine hidden ""XOF"" patches in the story mission, you also unlock access to two ""Extra Ops"" levels, one an amusing nod to the original Metal Gear Solid on PS1, the other a bizarre mix of elements from several other games, including Kojima's ""Snatcher"" visual novel, which was only available here in the US on the much-maligned SEGA CD. Beyond that, the anal-retentive among you may take interest in the various ""trials"", hard mode levels, and other increasingly minute and inane extras, though this is all to otherwise pad out the content of what is, at best, a two to three hour game. There are plot-relevant audio tapes scattered among the Side Ops that at least make them worthwhile. I would say about half of my playtime was spent listening to these tapes, and a good chunk of the rest was spent with my face in the mud, trying desperately to be good at stealth games. As this is not MGS4, I was at least partly successful.Nonetheless, I have heard it stated that Ground Zeroes is completely superfluous to one's enjoyment of Phantom Pain, and this is largely true. It is however, a small but key piece of the overall plot and on that basis alone, I recommend it to longtime Metal Gear fans. If for whatever reason you ignore the story in these games, then by all means skip this installment and proceed directly to Phantom Pain, which is a far greater value for the price- and now includes multiplayer, no less."

Yet thanks to the amazing gun play and large supply of varied and fun weapons there is a huge joy in blasting people in the face and laughing manically.Other than the main story as mentioned before there are a bunch of story modes, all of which take place in the mini sandbox of the army base. You could one play through save a VIP from gunfire whilst riding in a gunship or infiltrate and alien infested base as a cyborg ninja. Every mission has its own side objectives and collectables. There are hours of game play masterfully squeezed out of a relatively small space, yet not once did I feel restricted by the size of the game world and every play through felt fresh.The game is visual stunning even on my older rig. The Fox engine is fantastic and doesn’t show any signs of wear and tear. The rain effects on both characters and environments are particularly a favourite of mine. The game sounds great with an orchestral score that accompanies the action perfectly and period appropriate songs that I hummed for days afterwards, even now thinking back it’s on a loop in my mind. The voice acting is on point as well with a Keifer Sutherland nailing it for Snake and a particularly moving recording from Tara Strong.This game is the perfect prologue for MGS 5 and ends in a way that begs you to follow up with the main game. The fact that some of your decisions in this game affect the gameplay in the next is also a welcome addition. You would be mad to play MGS 5 without playing this first but even as a standalone game it is solid. I may not be able to get behind it at full price given its shorter running time and small game world but on sale this is a must buy for hours of stealthy / bombastic action.Have Fun ^_^"

The point of the other missions is to show how different weather, time of day, and where you enter the base from change how you can play the mission. (Since Phantom Pain will be open world this is an  attempt to show players how they can choose these later)  I have played probably over 20 hours on my PS4 version of the game (currently at 90% of 100% total completion but these are mostly hidden things and trails on the same few missions the game has, not 20 hours of full new content)  TL;DR  I like it but if you arent a fan dont buy it.

As a huge fan of the series, finishing every modern game except Peace Walker, please understand that I would give this a great review even if others seem to find flaws.Writing this about 5 days before MGSV:TPP is released, I have read reviews that state this is a must to quickly grasp the story in MGSV:TPP. Admittedly, I am missing a bit of the story myself, as I haven't finished Peace Walker.Now, to the game:The newer open world playstyle creates a ton of replayability. I was able to find this in all of the other MGS titles I have played, but it is more present in GZ. The short main story in this prologue has Kojima written all over it, with its suspense, cinematics, and action. The side ops almost force you to use different tatics than you are most comfortable with, making you a better tactician. As always, I first completed these with stealth being my main focus (not always suceeding.) Then it was guns a blazin' and no mercy.

Ground Zeroes serves as a narrative prologue, a tease at what sort of epic, stealth-oriented action we can expect from The Phantom Pain when it comes out later this year (September 1, if all goes well). Boy oh boy... well it's got me excited! Having NEVER played MGS, this was a very welcome introduction to the franchise. I couldn't quite follow the story (as expected), but, nonetheless, for what this game aims to do, MGS Ground Zeroes is a great game. The intense rescue missions and compelling cover based fire fights were intense and engaging. Landing a silent take down or a risky head shot from afar was oh, so satisfying. SNAKE IS A TOTAL BAD♥♥♥♥♥ Visually, this game is absolutely gorgeous and greatly optimized for the PC, which was the icing on the cake. Some may argue that the game is far too short for it's initial asking price of $30 when it first launched and I'm inclined to agree.

But that does not really interest me.The story is short and simple; sneak around and complete some objectives + listen to overdone dialogue. Which is quite enjoyable, since the stealthing is well done and the AI dumb/smart enough to facilitate getting away with being caught unless you're dumb enough to trigger all of them at once. ..or so I thought until I successfully attempted running across a fully lit parking lot with 10 guys firing at me, with a hostage on my back, and surviving.The graphics are approaching too good to be true (at least for my obsolete graphics card), and seamlessly switch from cutscene to gameplay. The game also runs smoother than diarrhea. I played on pretty high settings and had no frame dropping what-so-ever. Thumbs up for that.If you don't thing you'd enjoy what's basically a proof-of-concept, wait for METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN TRADEMARK VERY SUBTLE TRAILER AT THE END OF THIS GAME.

Was it worth the wait? Indeed it is, in every way possbile.Story (8.7/10)Welcome to Camp Omega, your mission is to resuce two captured operatives, Chico and Paz. That's it. That's the only mission of Ground Zeroes. Yes, it is short, you can finish it in around 1 - 3 hours depending how you approach the objective. The story, while short, which is not surprising, is pretty amazing, well-staged, and amazingly directed. GZ is a beginning of something bigger, much bigger, its only like 1/10 (or even less) compared to the ""main event"". I, in a way.. regret buying it.. the ending..oh..the ending, its really tone-deaf, when things starts to get interesting, it goes like ""BOOM"" and then ""THE END, TO BE CONTINUED IN PHANTOM PAIN"". Well damn.. I don't say I didn't expect this, but still.. >.>The way it tells the backstory was pretty great, mostly the events on Peace Walker. Tape cassete, diary, illustration, etc, give a needed insight of the previous event (Peace Walker Incident), but due to its tech demo / prologue nature, it still left possibly so many things ""in the dark"". But again, this is pretty much expected.Gameplay (9.3/10)Major improvement from the previous title I must say, well..atleast MGS IV. Camp Omega is a big, expertly-designed ""playground"" for the player to experiment a bunch of playstlye, full stealth, frontal assault, backdoor stealth, or even turn GZ to GTA, yes GTA, sort of.. One of the many magic of Metal Gear Solid is how it blend its good-old, familiar formula, polished it and add some fresh changes. MGS, in a gameplay standpoint, is one of those games that sees a natural evolution / progression as a game. It doesn't try to add something ""cool"" but falls off to be a unnecesary gimmicky, but it does geniunely push the boundaries to make it more immersive than before. It's still the same old and beloved MGS that we know, just with some pretty welcomed changes.The only downside that I have is, while the key binding is very well thought of, I don't need to rebind it, its confortable as what it is, buuut.. it do need a gamepad to play it in a more precise manner. Snake's movement is a bit stiff with a keyboard + mouse, I find myself getting caught off because of its movement awkwardness. Oh well, I do need to buy a gamepad sooner or later :vOh, and the A.I.. oh. the A.I, they feel..very real! A lot of thought is put to make the A.I behave in such an amazing and believable way, especially on harder difficulyt. Its not your ""5 inch in front of enemy, still not noticed"", in harder difficulty, you can be spotted in like some meter away, and even if you're in a higher elevation, if there's no to less cover, Enemy tagging is a way to tactically approach an area, and it is, by no means making the game easier. You have to quickly switch from careful planning, improvising, inconventional / creative 'imagination' and quick thinking if you want to achieve the most satisfying end result.One more thing, the U.I, its so clean, and it doesn't cluttered with any unnecesary info here and there. Its the old, simple MGS U.I, with top notch layout and still among one of the nicest U.I to look at.Graphic (10/10)ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS! I LOVE the balancing between realistic and cinematic, oh the detail, the particles, effects, etc. I can see Kojima Production put A LOT of effort of making a game that is merely a tech demo. Great level design, smooth animation, the stunning reflection of the wet camo of Big Boss as I taking cover from enemy's flashlight, Oh yeah..talk about the flashlight. The lighting in GZ is just beyond fantastic, And, the best thing of it all is the fact that FOX Engine is just sooo... light I genuinely suprised that my laptop can run it smoothly, and I mean it, no frame rate drop even when I set it to 85% Extra High setting, while 80% games nowadays lagged even when I set it to pure High / Medium-High and they still look worse than GZ, kudos to Kojima Production for setting an example of an absolutely excellent port.Sound (10/10)Solid, that's all. From the voice actors and sound effects is pure brilliance. I have nothing more to say regarding it. The sound is as detailed as the graphic could go.Conclusion (9.5/10)Kojima-sensei, you did it again. Not only you make an excellent game overall, as usual, but you make an even more (surprisingly) terrific port, that should raise the bar of how to flawlessy make a port of a console game, amazing graphic with an exceptional performance and confortable default key binding. A pretty badass tech demo I must say.As for recommendation:- Buy it if you are a massive MGS fan.- Buy it on sale if you are a massive MGS fan, but don't really want to waste a lot of money for a 1 - 3 hours game, like me.- If you're a ""normal"" MGS fan, wait for sale. Oh wait, is there any ""normal"" one? It only took one game to make someone a massive MGS fan.- If you're just looking for an excellent game to play, take it to cnosideration, when the price is dropped its recommended. But, by now.. everyone must know what Metal Gear Solid is, so.. I guess this one is ilogical.- If you don't like MGS, ♥♥♥♥ YOU, WHY? YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!- If you don't know MGS. Do you call yourself a gamer, seriously?Jokes aside: The main campaign itself is very short, but it does have some cool ""Side Ops"" and unlockables, also some hidden stuffs that prolonged the life of this short prologue. So, expect a gameplay of more than 10 hours if you REALLY want to reach 100% completion And as for my real recommendation, I highly  recommend this game, the price is right, but one thing you should know.. its a tech demo, don't expect more of what it is. Actullay GZ has, suprisingly quite a lot of content for a demo / prologue.EDIT: I play more than 2 hours, its like 6 - 7 hours, Steam doesn't count my offlline mode play."

There was a lot of controversy when it first released about the price, and I agree that anything over $40, is asking a little much, despite my previous statement.The quality of the content you get with Ground Zeroes, granted a lack of quantity, makes it a great introduction into the world and setting of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, as well as gameplay wise, although there are a few slight differences between the two, not all positive unfortunately. Such as reducing the combos for CQC, slightly disapointing. The gameplay in Ground Zeroes is so solid and polished, it handles almost exactly the same as it does in TPP, and not only is it fun and engaging, but it can also be very challenging, giving it a fair amount of replayability.I put over 20 hours into it, playing the Main Mission on normal and hard, as well as the Side Ops, on normal and some of them on hard and discovering some, but not all, of the collectibles. Realistically, that is over double the play time of most linear AAA titles being released as of late.

But that's not what I want to do - copy every other reviewer. So I will give you my honest thoughts on Ground Zeroes.This game is pretty much a masterpiece. The game is so damn polished and well crafted, from it's gorgeous graphics to its outstanding soundtrack - this is an unforgettable experience. I absolutely loved The Phantom Pain (I reviewed that too!) and literally could not stop playing it (I clocked in 59 hours as of this review!). Gameplay-wise this game is a marvel, it is near perfection. The only problem I have with it is that sometimes I would get locked into cover by accident while stealth/running as this game does not have a stick-to-wall button, if that makes any sense. It is not even really a problem that frequently occured, but it bugged me nonetheless.Cutscene-wise (story-wise) this game is a treat. I would say that you MUST ABSOLUTELY take everything into account, from the cassette tapes and everything else. There is a lot of content to check out, even though it has a ""demo"" period. It is not long, but getting 100% completion (which is a lot of fun and I recommend it) could take you around 10 hours. It is worth doing so because you would definitely get your money's worth. Also, this game has a ton of replay value as:1) You get ranked based upon how well you play and finish a mission2) There are different approaches to missions (gameplay-wise)3) There is a lot to find and uncover beneath its blubber.The cassette tapes are really REALLY fun to listen to in my opinion, and also, this game is not frustrating and cheap, like how TPP was at some points (oh lord...). I would have loved it if it had even more story and a few more side ops as it does feel very shallow overall.But still, I recommend you buy this if you didn't get enough of The Phantom Pain (even 59 hours later I want more - CHAPTER 3 ALREADY!) this game is really worth it, but other than that, The Phantom Pain pretty much explains everything that happened in Ground Zeroes and is a lot better overall. Also, the small map of GZ is in TPP Multiplayer, so there really isn't much content to distinguish itself from The Phantom Pain.So get it if you want, but getting TPP will be a much better idea financially."

All of the missions take place in that same, single area. You can approach the main mission as well as the 7 side/extra missions with either a stealth or guns-blazing mentality. The ranking that you receive at the end of completing the missions favors complete stealth with no killing, so you'll find the game the most rewarding if sneaking games are your thing. Certain missions really deter a purely action-forward style by introducing infinite guards when you are discovered. I found that a mix of 80% stealth/20% action was the most exciting: sneak on the way into the base and then let some bullets fly on your escape for a cinematic finish. Rocket launch a wooden guard tower on the flight out, sending the guard inside 30 ft. into the air for extra Rambo points.FAQ:Is the game really only 90 minutes?Yes and no. The main story mission will probably take you around 90 minutes on Normal difficulty on your first time through. However, if you like stealth games like Hitman and enjoy completing the challenges/achievements in them, you'll find a great value in Ground Zeroes. I spent around 30 hours getting a 100% completion rate, which mean that I got S-rank on all 8 missions, both Normal and Hard, and collected all the cassette tapes and XOF patches hidden around the base. I'd say the only lame achievements were the XOF patch and cassette collecting. You pretty much need to have your nightvision goggles on 24/7 and eagle eyes in order to spot them all. You can interrogate guards to find locations of them too but it's just a dumb, archaic gaming trope to have to ""collect"" items. It was okay in 1996 with Mario 64 but it's been nearly 20 years since then.Is it a good MGS game?Yes. It's the most fun I've had with MGS since MGS3. MGS4 was a complete dumpster fire of a game. It's refreshing to see this initial chapter of MGS5 prove that Kojima still knows how to create a real game instead of the awful anime-movie-game that was MGS4. To be fair, the one noticeable thing that Ground Zeroes is missing is a proper boss battle, but that's kind of a good sign in a way too: that Kojima doesn't feel completely chained to the experience of the previous games in the series and really wants to make MGS5 the best game possible.Recommended to those who enjoy action/stealth games and replay them religiously until they know every enemy's position in the level by heart."

Really widening the MGS world to a whole new level, adding more options to what you want to do and how you want to clear your missions. Story is linear, but there are minor details added in which might shift a bit in your playthrough.Also, it sucks that the console players had to pay 60 bucks for this. Glad we have it 20, huh?"

It will allow you a chance to stop the guard from causing an alert. So it is easier right? not really, Hideo Kojima's reason for adding this because the enemies in the two Metal Gear Solid V games can go anywhere in the area and are unpredictable.... sometimes.Some people said that this game is not worth the price and it's just a demo for Phantom Pain.

That is if you actually use stealth and not go in guns blazing like some kind of ---hole. Once beaten, you unlock other missions using the same map. Think of them as ""remixes."" You get new objectives like ""destroy this, kill that, rescue him."" There are collectible and unlockables.This is a very well made PC port. Kojima Productions must be hiring wizards because this is one of the best console ports I ever played. It's obvious they put a lot of consideration into this port.

Heck, being from a part of the woods where people are not raised on the English language, I can't even properly say the word ""stealth"", so what do you expect?Bought this because it looked so shiny, and it was on sale. Went in guns blazing while ignoring the ""story"", the radio man, the binoculars and everything else that gets in the way of shooting (presumed or actual) bad guys. This approach worked mighty fine for me in ""Dishonored"", another supposedly stealthy game I bought purely on the merits of its looks and then decided I hate crouching arround in the shadows all day like some sort of cowardly fruit bat.All of this teached me a few things about prison camps:1. nobody cares if you take over a guard tower, then proceed to shoot guards from the top of it. No reaction at all.2. only after a double digit body count and piles of bodies smelling up the camp streets, people suddenly begin to think something might be off. They might even raise some sort of alarm.3. ""alarm"" means they will send an endless stream of soldiers with rifles at you. Forever. Somewhere in the camp must be a place where they keep making new soldiers (I don't want to speculate on the details). The last time I saw this in ""IGI"" (not to be confused with IGN), IGI being a really mediocre shooter ... which I played for much longer than this game.4. nobody ever gets the idea to, oh ... I don't know ... hop into a tank or something or take cover behind it. It all really reminded me of ""Shooting Gallery"", a Shareware on my trusty 80286 back in 1985, albeit one had somewhat better controls than the other ... but MGS can't win every category, can it ? (see #9 for more on that)5. once I hop into a tank (it looked so lonely, with everyone else ignoring it), I learned that a tank gun has no aiming sights and is beyond useless, so the best approach is to roll over the opposition with your tank, during which they luckily cooperate swimmimgly with your endeavour by not moving away from the approaching tank at all.6. camp fences are made from unobtanium and are 100% tank proof7. your tank will suddenly explode for no apparent reason. If that happens, just hop into the next AA gun. The AI won't mind.8. Enemy soldiers, once pacified, will contain more bullets than an amateur-made nineteen slide Powerpoint presentation. It's probably realism ... 5,56 not being very good etc.9. I always underestimate the workload of the average Special Forces soldier. I mean, next to night vision, binoculars, and guessing where the mission objective might be (because I surerly couldn't tell on the iPad-look-alike ""Snake"" has), they have to memorize which shoulder will be up next, for aiming the rifle. Seriously, who alternates between left and right handed when bringing up their gun? Is Snake on a combat mission or a member of the Justin Timberlake background dancers? And why can't ""Snake"" aim over a waist-high obstacle properly? It's because Snakes don't have feet, is it??If you like stealth games, this is probably a good game, I am definetly the wrong person to ask, but I am giving it a thumbs up for that. If, on the other hand, you're like me and buy it because it's shiny, on sale, and with the idea of just curiously poking arround somewhat in the world's smallest open world game, let me tell you this: It's still almost perfect. There is just one major flaw, and that is with the character models: They are all missing the ice pick sticking out from their heads that should still be in there, from the lobotomies."

Which is so far proving just as an enjoyable as the other methods. I can't wait to get to the alternate mission objectives and camp layout types to explore the depth of this short taste of whats to come in The Phantom Pain.I 100% unequivocally recommend anyone that is a fan of the Metal Gear Solid series, or a fan of fun stealth/action games with a nice sense of humor to give this game a try. It's well worth the sale price and even at $19.99 it's still a worthwhile purchase.

It's a great introduction to the MSG world, a beautiful open level stealth game that will challenge you and make you ogle Snakes bum.One of the best things about this game is the replayability, the amount content that you unlock after completing the Ground Zeroes campaign, you'll be at 7% complete, this is really worth the money spent as it will unlock additional missions. I played through all the missions and managed to achieve an ""S"" rank for all the missions, I got all the tapes, all the patches, and I am still at 95% complete. The only thing left to do is fine tune my gameplay and replay and complete the trials.The game is set in Cuba, 1975 at a U.S. military base that is operating without oversite from the goverment. Someone wants a place to interrogate POW's that won't fall under Cuban, American, UN law. It's really like what has (is) happening in the world today, minus the Miley Cyrus nipple flashes, although... nevermind.Playing as Snake you'll crawl and crouch your way through the base, either knocking out the soldiers or killing and hiding the bodies, I would knock them out and then throw them into the sea so that they wouldn't wake up and be a bunch of jerks. I really like the CQC aspect and the animations that Snake does and the animations of the soldiers as they crashed head first into a wall or me slamming their pathetic American asses into ground, yeah that makes me smile.The graphics are just so beautiful, the dust, rain, and night and day changes are really well done. I played through the extract the classified intel mission and found that I was sneaking through the entire level on my stomach, crawling through the grass and quietly sneak past the guards and cameras, just like I do at work. Up close the weeds show some low resoluton but that's ok.The Stealth aspect is so well done that I wished that more designers would take clues on how to do stealth right. Sneaking around the large open level was an absolute blast. Knowing that I held some dumb♥♥♥♥♥American soldier's life in my hand made me feel like a god, or at least a high powered super soldier. The animations are very well done, for Snake and the soldiers.

I have squeezed every ounce of gameplay from this prologue to The Phantom Pain, and to say that I'm waiting for September first is a massive understatement.Edit/Update:I believe it's time to actually state my impressions of this game in a bit more detail.Right off the bat, the thing that Ground Zeroes nails perfectly is the level design. The map is just perfect in size, with different segments requiring proper planning and study of enemy movements in order to infiltrate stealthily. Now, the stealth in this game has been executed to near-perfection, and while you can go guns blazing - its much more satisfying if you are actually patient with the game and go with the stealthy approach. There will be a lot of trial and error involved, and granted that some may not be up for it, but you will develop a compulsion to perfect your playthrough. Think of it as the satisfaction that comes with nailing three purple sectors in a Formula 1 game. The level design of Ground Zeroes has a big part to play in this - it encourages you towards such a goal.Another aspect of the game worthy of praise is the enemy AI. While individually the enemy is what you'd expect from a modern stealth game - each have their own routine within the area which they patrol, they look out for suspicious activities and check them out, one thing that sets them apart is  that if possible, they always communicate via radio to the base HQ when they are about to perform some action that is beyond their normal routine - like checking out anything suspicious. This means that you have to track them till they radio back to HQ that things are fine. This adds to the immersion as you have to decide when to make a move on them - if you take them out when HQ expects some communication back from them, then the base will go on a level 1 alert, when nearby personnel are notified about the incident. Following this, if you are discovered, then the whole base goes on alert. This attention to detail leads to some very tense moments leading you to frantically search for cover or take the guards out carefully, as you're vulnerable out in the open especially on hard difficulty. That said, on rare occasions, the AI can be hilariously incompetent - once I was lying prone, perfectly still in tall grass when 3-4 guards were just a feet or two away and couldn't spot me. That's an exception though, not a norm.Coming to the story, while it is clear that Kojima tackled something very politically charged in this game, I don't think he quite hit the target he aimed for. Even though this is my first Metal Gear game and I was willing to put aside all the things that happened in the previous games for the sake of concentrating just on this one, I must say that it wasn't as satisfying. For more details, check out youtuber Super Bunnyhop's impressions on the story of Ground Zeroes.Oh, and the last thing - the optimization in this game is phenomenal. Considering how pleasing the graphics are, it took me by surprise that I could run it on my ancient 9-year-old PC with a Core 2 Duo CPU and a GT 730 DDR5. I left the settings at default with v-sync off at 1366x768 resolution and got 20-30fps throughout every mission. Say what you want about my standards of playability but I was absolutely fine with it. No crashes whatsoever.Now I just need the time to get my hands on The Phantom Pain."

I bought this originally several months ago on the PS4 and just as a tech demo/prologue for the real game coming in 2015, it has more content, lasting appeal, and enjoyment than even most $60 AAA retail-price games. I found many of the easter eggs around the map to be awesome callbacks to past events from the series (or future events in the full timeline of things), and Deja Vu mode really let that nostalgia from the first Metal Gear Solid sink in.The game is just so robust in every way, and with the PC release, the Fox Engine greatly enhances that with its amazing weather and lighting effects to really give the game a next-gen cinematic feel. Hideo Kojima and his team have done a MASTERFUL job porting this to our beloved PC platform, and although the controls are finnicky with the keyboard and you can't use your mouse in the main menu (would really recommend a controller for this one since a lot of movements feel like they're made for analog), the actual game itself runs smooth as butter. On my desktop running with a GTX 980, it looks fantastic on max settings (I would recommend turning down the Screen Filter to Low or High though. The DoF is really intense at Very High). But even when I tried it out on my 3-year old Alienware laptop I could get a consistent 60 fps on medium settings, including the particle-intense areas like the ending cutscene.The hype train for Phantom Pain now has no brakes :D Get it for the cheap $13!

Well,I was wrong.Maybe the main story mission is short (around 90 minutes at first try), but there are 6 more missions takes another 50-90 minutes to complete each. At this time I have 14+ hours in this game and haven't completed all of the content, so i will go back again and continue this great game.The open world setting and the very polished gameplay mechanics makes the thing so great. You can go from any direction, with any weapon, using any tactics from killing all, to sleep/stun the guys or just avoid them.The various missions taking place different times of a day, and the camp's layout offers many possibilities to take on or fool those guards, who are present in different numbers and walking on different patrol routes in each mission.An the top of that there is a real big replay value in this game. I am really not the guy, who likes to repeat the same thing all over again, but the rating system at the mission's end, and the unlockable weapons, skins, or easter eggs made me having great fun with this game.Playing this game is the most fun from actual gameplay aspect than any other previous MGS title.9/10 where the 9 means that this game is one of the best games in the genre if not.+ Exemplary optimalization and port quality.

I didn't have any issues getting the game to start. Some have reported crashing upon launching of the game. I turned all the settings to ""Extra High"" and was running between 45-60fps, mostly in the mid to upper 50s (FX-8350, GTX 680 2GB Model). You don't need 4GB of vram, at least not for 1080p.  The most demanding shot of the game, for me, was where you first gain control of Big Boss. Looking at the whole compound, I noticed a drop to 45. That's as low as it went for me. The game looks great. The main mission took an hour and 20 minutes for me. It would have been slightly longer but I messed up towards the end and had to forget about stealth tactics. I can't comment on KB/M controls, I used a gamepad. After finishing the main mission I've only got an 8% completion so I have a fair bit more to go. If you only want to do the main mission then this probably isn't worth the price tag for you.

It's ok if you don't know Peace Walker, but you might not know who you're rescuing or why. It's normal for MGS games, if you haven't played the previous one you might be lost in the current. Where the full fledged games might tell you what's going on eventually Ground Zeroes is basically one main rescue mission, so not really much time for storytelling. It plays like any other MGS game, so like a military version of Hitman. Sneak or shoot your way around to kill, rescue or demolish in one main and several side missions.Main mission should take around 1-2hrs, each side mission is 30-45mins long. All in all there should be about 4-6hrs of playtime here if you don't like repeating things. There are several challenges, achievements and a hard mode if you like to replay things though.

Ground Zeroes only contains a single stage, but there are multiple missions that can be played on said stage, increasing the replayability. As a MGS fan, I found the missions and the upgraded mechanics to be very engaging, and ended up playing this over and over as if it were an arcadie indie game. One downer was that I had to unlock the HARD difficulty, which is what I would rather have started with seeing as NORMAL is ridiculously easy, but I'm just nitpicking at this point.

Set 9 years before TPP, this game will answer some of the questions that you might have if you ended up playing the main game first (which was the case for me). Although TPP will show a brief flashback to the events in this game, witnessing them yourself is definitely worth it as the cinematics of this game is incredible. Combine that with the great dialogue and superb voice acting, Ground Zeroes will set you up nicely for The Phantom Pain.Game Elements:All of the missions can only be done in one small map, which makes sense because the game is just some sort of a demo. The gameplay is smooth and just like The Phantom Pain, this game has a great optimization for PC, so you won't need a high-end PC to play both of them. Controls can be a bit confusing especially if this is the first time you've played a game from the Metal Gear series, but it will become relatively simple once you get used to it. You will also get some staff members that will be of great help for the early game of The Phantom Pain, giving an incentive for players to go for the 100% completion rate for this game.Buy now? Or wait for a sale?I do not recommend buying this game at full price, as it is really expensive for the small amount of content it has.

Do not expect lengthy, confusing cutscenes here: this is a sandbox, through and through, and you make the game what it is.A final note: even with its minimalistic content (in the best possible way), the Fox Engine holds up better than most 3rd person shooters in a firefight, and blows stealth/sniper games out of the water.

Just a heads up, this is a pretty early review. !I'm really impressed with Ground Zeroes and it's actually making me excited for The Phantom Pain. This is my first MGS since the second one on PS2, so I'm pretty rusty with the style of MGS games.Performace wise everything is on high, but I have lighting at Extra High. It has run pretty dang smooth with very minimal FPS drop on my GTX 760. It does cap itself at 60 FPS though and I highly recommend vsync to be turned on. I turned it off because I don't like vsync, but you will definitely want it on. The screen tears are bad and possibly even worse than Titanfall's screen tears. This is, however, only been done in the beginning of the game where it's raining and it's at night. I don't think the daytime lighting will have any impact at all, but I've only tried one section of the game.Again, I'm really impressed. I was actually expecting a pretty bad port, but wow... The performance optimization of this game has really surprised me. It does have it's fair share of issues (Like the controller crash, where if you have your controller plugged in at startup it crashes the game), but overall it's pretty solid. It's cheaper than what it was on consoles, so I jumped onto it when I had the chance."

Have finished one playthrough with KB/M and they are perfectly functional controls. Going to go in again with a PS4 controller as that's what I'm used to for MG games.The replayability and openness of the base is fantastic. Voice acting is superb as you would expect.Having some issues with performance though. Running an R9 285 2GB and any texture setting above Low will make the game unplayble and stutter. This is the only oddity and all other settings impact performance like they should.Overall, it's a great Metal Gear game and great game in general! Highly recommended.Edit: Long overdue performance update. I upgraded from the 7700K that I wrote this review with to a 4790S in late December and it makes all the difference. I can now play with High/Extra High settings and Medium textures (due to 2GB limit) and the game is gorgeous. I'm nearing 110 hours, so obviously it's pretty good."

The game looks absolutely beautiful on PC. If you're new to the MGS franchise or a hardcore veteran, you need this title in your library.Ground Zeroes is more of a showcase of the new Fox engine and a teaser to get people pumped for The Phantom Pain than a complete standalone game. The map isn't huge, but there are so many different ways that you can infiltrate the base and accomplish your mission that it makes up for the short story. The stealth mechanics are fluid and very responsive, and in many ways this is the best Metal Gear Solid game ever created. When this game was first released, some people were upset with how short the actual mission is. However, it's priced accordingly and worth every penny you'll pay for it. I've played over a hundred hours on my PS3 and still didn't complete all the challenges.The main mission is Ground Zeroes, but once you beat that it unlocks several other missions (some during daytime) that show just how much fun you can have on a single map. If you enjoy the stealth gameplay, you'll be delighted to run back through the missions multiple times, trying to infiltrate from different angles, and trying to complete each one without killing anybody or being seen at all. It's much more challenging than you might expect, but extremely rewarding. I've yet to find another game that gives you that same stealth feeling as Metal Gear Solid."

There are 6 additional side mission/ops that would take around 10 to 15 minutes each to complete. Obviously you can extend the playtime by finding collectables and doing trial challenges but it would get boring after awhile. All the side ops and main mission takes place in the same map too.On the bright side, this game has really great graphics and has gameplay which mixes action and stealth perfectly. The music and sound design is really good as well! I am pretty sure there are a number of easter eggs meant for metal gears fan which can be found in abundance in one of the side ops.I think that the content to price ratio is really bad and I do not recommend purchasing it on it's own.

,Recommended,311340,17754497,"Posted: 28 August, 2015",all,Super Duper Shark,"I was skeptical about this game after first playing it on a PS4 and not being impressed. I opted to prepurchase The Phantom Pain when I saw it came with Ground Zeroes and I'm glad that I did because I think that this title is surprisingly well done.Content wise this game offers more than a lot of people give it credit for. There is one main mission that can take up to an hour on the first playthrough that serves as the prologue to The Phantom Pain. After the main mission the player is given access to four very different side missions that take place on the same map. Beyond the five missions I have mentioned so far are two goofy bonus missions that can be unlocked if the player completes a fairly easy task during the main mission. That's seven missions total, each filled with options that provide a fair degree of replayability for the asking price.Controls are significantly better than I had expected. I've read that the previous MGS games had wonky controls on PC, but that is certainly not the case for this game. Aiming with a mouse instead of a controller makes all the difference in the world with this game. The only thing I would like to see changed is a dedicated button to take cover because the automated snapping into cover can be difficult and mess up the camera angle on occasions.Ground Zeroes offers one rather large map for players to complete in a variety of ways. It's worth $20. It's a steal at anything less."

Decided to start with Ground Zeros to familarize myself with the gameplay before starting Phantom Pain. The game itself is very well done, and has very addictive gameplay.This is a single level game, and once you finish the main mission, you unlock more missions to try to accomplish.  You can replay the missions over again to try to get higher ratings also. If trying to do the perfect run is your thing, there is a lot of replay value here. If not, it will seem like a rather short game.I am not a big writer of reviews, but felt compelled to write this one to expose the one thing that may be a game breaker for some.This game was designed for a gamepad. Thats fine, and you can use the keyboard and mouse to play as well, and it works fine if you are a wasd player. If, like me, you play with the arrow keys and their surrounding keys, you can not remap most keys around the arrows making the game unplayable by ME with the keyboard and mouse.There is a scripting program that can be used to fix this as long as you remember to run the script before starting the game. I still have not found a comfortable way to map the keys and use the kb and mouse because many action require multiple keypresses simutaneously.I use an xbox controller as a compromise, not a choice because the game is that good."

Basically.Now if you can get it for cheap (I got it for 5€), it's absolutely worth it.It has only has one relatively small map and one story mission + side-ops you unlock after ""beating the game""*(*Completing the main mission, which you can do depending on your skill and play style, in like and hour.

Sutherland is a good enough actor and all, but you can't just go and change the voice of your main character! I hate that, but I'll deal with it on account of the game being great.Now to the many technical problems:(I played it on a controller. Though the aiming isn't great, I think games like this play better on a controller)- The cursor cannot be hidden(Only by moving it to my second monitor, which btw the game lets you do, so the cursor capturing isn't working properly). It does disappear for a while, but it always comes back in a few seconds.(Yes, I am sure I did not move my mouse or use the keyboard, which would explain that)- The game sometimes randomly kicks me to the desktop, after which my PC thinks that the game still has focus, but it doesn't. (And no, I cannot change focus, meaning changing the window or forcing the game to be on top from task manger. It doesn't work). Basically you have to kill the process and restart the game.- Also, using borderless, you cannot change focus to another window at all (Alt-tabbing not working.) Again, windows THINKS it has changed focus, but the game remains on top no matter what.*- Randomly lost audio during gameplay once. (*Might be that something else went wrong, since I lost audio from windows completely, weird either way...)-Also, (personal preference) the highest after effects setting forces obnoxious blur and DOF to the game. Putting it on second highest settings reduces it, but also disables screen space reflections.(Low ---------- adds Bloom LightingHigh --------- adds Depth of Field (Blur) + FXAAExtra High - adds Extra Depth of Field (Blur) + Screen Space Reflections) (Thanks to Harbi.)Over all it's a great DEMO and I would recommend it if you either can get it for cheap, or are a HUGE fan.

,Recommended,311340,17525103,"Posted: 13 August, 2015",all,KT_Extinction,"Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes is a fantastic experience that is much, much too short. I can recommend just because it is relatively cheap and absolutely worth the money. Metal Gear Solid is one of those legendary gaming icons that ranks up there with Mario and Zelda, and a majority of long time gamers will have had a few adventures with Snake and friends in the past.I remember when, in middle school I went to my friend’s house to play Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty on the PS2. The graphics were some of the most incredible I've ever seen, keep in mind the majority of my gaming experience comes from Starcraft and Goldeneye. When viewed in first person mode, the amount of attention to detail Kojima and his team put to detailing the weapons, environment, and enemies is astounding considering the game was designed for fixed camera angles. I also own the Metal Gear Solid HD collection on my aging 360, and replaying the earlier Metal Gear Solids today feels really weird. The notorious ""hold down button tightly and release quickly"" to shoot mechanic is annoying and the fixed camera angles are often constraining, but I believe these mechanics were designed for a reason. Snake isn't a military grunt who shoots first and asks questions after, he is a highly trained, intelligent, and most of all, sneaky super soldier. Trying to ""Rambo"" your way through the game was very difficult because of how quickly snake dies in direct combat. Having to press so many buttons before allowing you to shoot accurately lends added weight to the act of firing a weapon. In addition to the iron sights of the firearms being incredibly detailed, the guns all recoil with realistic force. The game models the ""feel"" for firing a weapon really well, much better than the standard COD feeling of having a gun pointed eternally forward and firing at everything.Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is definitely my favorite MGS game, with the least confusing storyline(albeit still confusing by most video game standards) and unique gameplay mechanics. It still holds some of the most memorable moments for me(such as Snake's awesome 1911 speech), in spite of the sometimes awkward controls. The time I spent sneaking through dense jungle and wearing an alligator hat were fantastic times. I found Big Boss to be a more interesting character compared to the somewhat goofy Solid Snake, but I look back on that with a kind of nostalgic charm. The new HD re-release added in a free camera which improved the game immensely, and it shows the same ridiculous attention to detail in a game that is normally played from a fixed camera angle.After a few years, I completed Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. I was pretty damn hyped for this game but I have to admit, I was kind of disappointed. The storyline has spun itself into a confusing mess, which even the most diehard of MGS fans had difficulty following. Kojima's proclivity to long, cinematic cutscenes had reached a breaking point, for me at least, and there were entire chapters that went like this: CUTSCENE…Five minutes of gameplay...45 minute long..CUTSCENE.. CHAPTER COMPLETE!I enjoy long monologues and epic set pieces as much as the next guy,  but I felt as if I barely even PLAYED any of MGS 4. Sure, some may disagree with me and tell me that I don't appreciate Kojima's unmatched brilliance in storytelling, etc.. But I was still let down by this game. The attention to detail is still present in spades, there are 70 guns that are meticulously detailed in a game where you're most likely only going to use a couple of them. You can use anything from the obscure P-19 Bizon to an old school Mosin Nagant. The game is beautiful as well, being one of the best looking games on PS3 despite coming out earlier in its cycle. Despite all this, and a satisfying conclusion, I'm still not the biggest fan of MGS 4 when compared to previous games. The controls have finally been brought to the modern era, and thankfully the game plays more like a conventional third person shooter but some of the ""weight"" of the shooting has been lost. It's also a lot easier to ""Rambo"" through situations now, which is kind of disappointing considering the game's sneaky pedigree.Now, 7 years later, we are on the eve of Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain's release. I'm very, very excited, and part of that excitement is from my experience with Ground Zeroes. MGS 5 has changed the formula in different ways. First of all, the loss of David Hayter as the voice of Snake is a bummer, but Kiefer Sutherland is a fantastic replacement. I’m a huge fan of 24, and hearing Jack Bauer threaten soldiers is something I look forward to. David Hayter, god bless him, is a hard working voice actor, but his voice always carries a tinge of goofiness to it. Kiefer Sutherland’s low growling cadence gives the game a much more grounded and dark tone, which is what the game is trying to aim for. There are still bouts of goofiness, cardboard boxes and animal fulton-ing, but the game is much more serious. And grounded, is exactly what I think the Metal Gear Solid series needed. Beyond the political conspiratorial intrigue, the deep philosophical ponderings, and weird fifth-wall breaking antics, Metal Gear Solid is about Tactical Espionage Action. It says so right on the box art! There will still be hints of the previous things in MGS5, but I’m hoping those take a backseat to the core of the gameplay. The storyline seems more grounded as well, as you are playing as Big Boss, the founder of an “Outer Heaven” for your soldiers. The games are also set in the 1970s-1980s, so even though we will lose some of the cool near future gadgets, we still have a set of more realistic, relatable tools. Ground Zeroes, even as short as it is offers you many different approaches of sneaking into the base undetected, or even going in guns blazing if you prefer. MGS 5 is promising to be truly open world, which is something that I’ve been hoping for from an MGS game for a while. MGS3 seemed to imply a large, forested environment you can traverse while sneakily stalking your prey, and MGS4 promised a constantly changing battlefield with two warring factions you can sneak through. Unfortunately, both of these games ended up mostly consisting of small hallway-like areas that you have to sneak down, which is fine, but I believe it’s time for something more. From gameplay demos showing at E3 and otherwise, there’s so much freedom in choosing your own approach to objectives, that I’m sure I’ll be sneaking in MGS5 for a long, long time. You truly feel like the leader of a private military group, bringing up your PDA and scouting out the area for the best approach route. No other MGS has really given you that feeling of planning a mission on your own, and the way the mission evolves happens organically based on your own decisions.Having both of these games come to PC was a ridiculously awesome parting gift from Kojima. Ground Zeroes runs extremely well and I’m confident The Phantom Pain will as well, and watching Big Boss sneakily crawl through the rain at 60 fps while the light shimmers realistically on every surface is fantastic. The attention to detail is present even in this short game. Big Boss reloads all the weapons meticulously and the environments are incredibly detailed. Sadly, Konami’s been turning into one of the most ♥♥♥♥ed up game corporations I’ve ever seen, and even buying these games feels like I’m giving money to the devil. Kojima’s definitely leaving at the end of this game’s release, so this will most likely be the last Konami product I ever buy. However, if MGS5 is the final game that Kojima makes, it’ll definitely be a goodbye worth of remembrance. To be honest, every MGS game since MGS3 has been promised to be the final game in the series, and it looks like MGS5 is definitely the final one. Play Ground Zeroes, and get hyped for The Phantom Pain with me!"

(finished the main segment in about 50 minutes) I advise buying this when it's onsale apart of the MGS:V Definitive Experience, it's very worth the money at the price its given.

This may not be a full game, but you're not buying it at a full game's price. This is a fantastic prologue, and I can't wait for Phantom Pain!What has been put into this game is WELL worth the $13-20 dollars. There are SEVEN missions (not one like most people say) with both normal and hard difficulties for all of them."
,Recommended,311340,20280360,"Posted: 3 January, 2016",all,J_vemp,"The infamous ""paid demo"", of course now you'll be able to get it for cheaper than the original $20-30 asking price. Which, for long standing Metal Gear fans shouldn't have been controversial in the first place as the famous Tanker prologue mission for MGS2 was a demo put into Zone of the Enders as a marketing tool back then.The question is the asking price worth it for a game that only has around a 2hr long (first playthrough) main mission.Years before The Phantom Pain was out I would of said that ye the $20 is worth it to tide ye over till TPP. But since TPP is out, whenever it's on sale for $10 or less I would say is the fair price for the content.Let's talk about the content, it's not just the main mission as much as people would argue against it. The side ops are all worth playing atleast once. And thankfully PC gets both console exclusive missions. This is also not including all the secret challenges to do to get to 100% completion, but I wouldn't attempt getting the full completion. Getting to about 50% completion I would say is just enough where you will see all the fresh content which is about 15hrs.DEFINITELY get this before playing TPP, and if you're new to the Metal Gear series I think this is in fact a nice way of taste testing (legally ofc) if the Stealth Action is for you without having to impulse buy full price main title.The story takes place right after the events of MGS Peace Walker, so if you are not familiar with that game (specifically the secret ending) than the story will be confusing.Speaking of..... Ground Zeroes is in my opinion the most disturbing Metal Gear game due to its visuals and audio.... Ofc any M rated videogame is gonna have violent murder, but this game's special for having body horror and audio of sexual assault. You have been WARNED. And to clarify: I don't believe it's just for shock value either as just like previous MG titles have clear messages of anti-nuke, GZ is meant to be anti-guantanamo bay.Welp this is getting serious.... how about we talk about the port job now. As of the AMD patch the game should run fine and look pretty as heck if you have current console generation specs. The draw distance is smaller and the SSAO isn't as well defined as it is in TPP, but I don't think that takes too much away from how pretty FOX engine is.I played the game using a ps3 controller so I had no problem with controls, I heard with m+kb your aim is godlike but some sneaking actions are a little awkward. So be aware of that.Alright this is going on too long for just a DEMOO ;), let me summarize:*On sale for around $10 I would recommend Ground Zeroes for any Metal Gear fan who was off put by the baka ""paid demo controversy"" or fans of stealth games OR someone who wants to try a stealth game for the first time*Good port (BUT: not sure how awkward kb+m is, as I only played with gamepad)*Story only engaging if you've played/know the story of Peace Walker*WARNING: Body horror and audio of sexual assault.And to lighten things up, some FUN tips WOO!:*if new or newb, play with reflex mode ON*if want challenge, play with reflex mode OFF*roll around for the most epic cutscene of the series*if newb and you get lost, interrogate ppl*the side ops take place time-wise before the main mission, but as ""pseudo"" recreation, meaning it's meant to be taking place on another map so keep that in mind"
,Recommended,311340,13989886,"Posted: 14 January, 2015",all,Banana Bread,"Mostly excellent PC version of a great game. My only complaint would be that the menus can't be navigated by mouse, but that's easy to get used to. Haven't encountered any other issues in that regard. I guess reflex mode probably makes the game a lot easier than was intended now that you can use a mouse, but you can always turn that off.As for the game itself, some will complain that it's a demo and well... It basically is, but there's enough content here with enough replay value to merit paying over $10. The controls are very in-depth, the mechanics are top-notch (apart from the sometimes wonky marking mechanic,) the gameplay is very open-ended. There is one side mission that kind of sucks but if this game is any indication, The Phantom Pain will be one of the best MGS games. And that means a lotIt's not really essential to buy right now since I'm sure it'll be included in some kind of deal with The Phantom Pain, but if you're a fan who wants to preview the game and make the most of Ground Zeroes, I highly recommend grabbing it beforehand."

There are alternate side ops which are okay and take longer to complete in total than the main mission, but they are all presented in the same map, but under different conditions.Finally I would like to sum this up as:A good game, worth the money if its on a sale and you want to get to know the storyline behind the Phantom Pain, otherwise its not worth it for the lack of content on full price."

The only value in replaying them is trying to get a better score.The campaign is set on a massive map, which is not really that huge, but is definitely packed with various ways for you to approach every situation.It's pretty interesting and you will definitely enjoy it if you're a fan of Metal Gear, and if you just want an intro into Phantom Pain, because it reveals several key plot elements and fills in the holes in the plot you might have observed if you didn't play this.I would recommend this to every diehard Metal Gear fan as well as anyone looking for a quick stealth game, leading up to the masterpiece that is Phantom Pain."

It is the new Pièce de résistance of the Metal Gear series.You'll see complaints about the length of this game. To clarify, the main mission in this game averages around an hour and forty minutes long. There are also numerous side missions to complete, which bump the playtime up to an average of six hours long.To complete the game 100%, that is collecting all cassette tapes, getting all accolades in-game, rescuing everybody you're supposed to, and getting the best rank you can in the game, unlocking absolutely everything there is to unlock, you're looking at an average of at least 16 and a half hours of game-play out of this game.To reiterate, if you play it just for the main mission and put it down after that, you're going to be disappointed. The intent with the release of this product was for fans of the series to try out the new game, get performance statistics over a wide series of systems, and see how the community responded to major changes in how the game operated.Choose your own destiny. Are you going to play this as a four minute speed-run of just one mission, or are you going to actually completely play the game and enjoy every last bit of what you paid for?Performance is excellent. You can tell that the Fox engine has been given tons of love with a multiplatform focus being the centric point behind it. Running a GeForce 660, I'm able to achieve 60FPS constantly in all situations with all settings maxxed (with the exception of SSAO being on high as opposed to very high.)The controls are excellent, keyboard and mouse users will not be disappointed - you can rebind any key to where you want. Yes, I know it sounds ridiculous for me to even have to say that, but you'd be surprised with the massive number of shoddy console ports that have left this most basic function out. There are also a number of default controller layouts available for users whom are using standardized gamepads.Likewise, one of the most common complaints people have about the controls is the usage of arrow keys while in the menus - however they are not necessary. Somehow, everybody has overlooked the big prompts that say ""1"" and ""3"" in the menus, which should typically be enough to tell people that instead of relying on arrow keys to move the menus left and right, you can just use the ""1"" and ""3"" keys to scroll left and right respectively.Story - 10/10. Yes, it's short, but this is intended as a prologue for the main game. The cassette tapes which can be found in all the missions provide more tastes of the story, making you desire for more.Kojima-san, you magnificent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, why do you tease us so?"

However, the alert system feels like a step down from previous games in the series: whereas from MGS2 onwards guards would have to contact their base with the radio (which you could shoot down) to trigger an alert, in this game everyone in the base will know about you the moment a guard says ""Huh?"". This is mitigated by the reflex mode which triggers a slow motion when you are spotted, but it feels like a cheap clutch.Storywise, it's hard to judge this game without knowing what TPP has in store, but it does have some moments of dialogue that are a bit cringe-worthy.Graphically, this game is a technical wonder. It runs on a huge variety of systems and looks absolutely amazing in any modern system.Finally, regarding content, this is a demo that already sucked 10 hours of my life. The main story mission will take you an hour or two to complete, but there are 5 additional missions, all taking place in the same map, which add a few hours to the game if you enjoy the gameplay.

Say what you will about the length of the main mission, but this game clearly makes a case for the term ""content"" being much more nuanced than how most people refer to it.Camp Omega is the real star of the show in Ground Zeroes - feeling like an amalgamation of the very best levels from Thief, Hitman, and the Splinter Cell series in their heyday - and it reinforces how the stealth genre is more about the levels than anything else. Everything about Camp Omega feels like it was crafted by experts: The believable vantage points, the sparing-yet-dense use of both high and low grounds, the use of light and shadow, it's all there.The PC version (both surprisingly and unsurprisingly) is the definitive way to play this game. The FOX Engine truly shines when left to flex its muscles on superior hardware. Seeing rainwater drip down the face of one of the many nameless soldiers I would chokehold into submission later on in the opening cutscene was the first sign of the capabilities of this new engine.I feel like the bar has been raised impossibly high by Ground Zeroes as a prologue to the upcoming The Phantom Pain. If the levels in the full game can capture even a fraction of the craft seen on display in this game, it will be more than something special."
,Recommended,311340,13686547,"Posted: 29 December, 2014",all,TFDoom,"As a long time MGS fan I was ecstatic to see METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES appear on Steam. The storyline is best appreciated if you have played the previous games in the series but, unlike MGS4, there is very little that will leave newbies confused. Ground Zeroes marks a distinct maturation for Kojima's writing - this time the big concept (torture) is not marred by goofy tonal changes. Granted, there is a character called Skullface, but that's about as far-fetched as it gets.OK, GAMEPLAY:Initially I was concerned that the new additions to the series - such as being able to mark enemies, go into bullet-time slow-mo upon being detected and, crucially, Kiefer Sutherland as the new voice of Big Boss (!) - were concessions to casualising the series. Upon playing Ground Zeroes, I realise this couldn't be further from the truth. Kojima has provided one of the most brilliant, dynamically evolving AI toyboxes I've encountered since Grand Theft Auto 4. All the new techniques are a welcome addition to a series that was beginning to feel a bit long in the tooth and, most importantly, do not skewer the difficulty curve. Animation is fantastic, with Big Boss being an utter joy to control on either controller or keyboard. I actually prefered keyboard controls for aiming accuracy, although the lack of analogue control is a drawback to this method.Much has been made of the fact that Ground Zeroes is a glorified demo. I would argue that the sandbox gives you the scope and tools to play literally for however long you desire. You can theoretically complete the game in 20 minutes but, aside from speedrunning, where is the fun in that? MGS fans know they will get their moneysworth, and Ground Zeroes serves as the perfect introduction to a true gaming institution for those not 'in the know'.Special props to the PC port: Namco, this is how you do it! As of now this is the 'best' version of Ground Zeroes, running smoothly and looking gorgeous on the most humble of toasters. I've encountered no crashes, glitches, or slowdown since playing.ROLL ON PHANTOM PAIN"

If you are a completionist and trial lover, this game has plenty of replay value: the main mission takes around 30 to 60 minutes to complete, while the side missions range from 10 to 40 minutes, with a total of at least 7 hours of gameplay, excluding collectables, different strategies, trials and 16 Steam achievements to unlock.The game uses the Fox Engine, which revolves around realistic lighting and shadow casting. The gameplay is simply perfect: every gun handles really well, CQC is really fluid, driving vehicles is fun and beating the game without being spotted is incredibly rewarding.The graphics have been greatly improved and look gorgeous on the highest settings. The game is also very well optimised, and even a small laptop can play it with a solid 60fps on Low.There are, however, some problems with this port.First of all, the shell casings don't show up when you shoot, the reload animations of the handguns don't work properly and the infamous right arm glitch when carrying people is still present. This are, however, some small bugs that can easily be fixed in a future patch.The worst feature that is absent in this version is the custom music for the helicopter: you can only use the music used in the game, not custom tracks on your computer. Again, I hope that this gets fixed in a future patch.Overall, this is a technical marvel and the most replayable Metal Gear game. This is quite easily my Game of The Year, and a perfect game.Story: 9Graphics: 10Gameplay: 10Challenge: 8.5Sound: 9Replayability: 10ENJOYMENT: 10FRUSTRATION: 4Follow me on Twitter: @nickygra97Subscribe to my channelLike on Facebook{LINK REMOVED}Check my official websiteJoin my Steam group"

The gameplay is excellent and gives you a solid idea of what TPP is going to be like plus leads you (story-wise) into MGSV:TPP.Without giving away any spoilers; I found elements of the story to be unexpectedly brutal and as yet, in TPP, I have yet to encounter anything nearly as disturbing.

,Recommended,311340,13780122,"Posted: 2 January, 2015",all,P-Scarlet,"First of all, I would like to slap anyone who says that this game can be completed under 2 hours. I have 22 hours at the moment and still at the 21% of completion ratiobecause I am lewd autist.Now let's check'n'compare this game with previous Metal Gear games:We got one big(not really big, butbig enough, yep) location. We will roam it in every mission, the only thing that changes is weather, day\night, placement of guards, their field of vision, placement of cars\trucks and items. Whole concept kinda reminds of hitman games: you got big locations, you got NPCs with certain algorithms, you task is learn these algorithms and make your way through them to your target. There are events that will happen without of intervention of players, but certain small things are requing you to do something - for example, certain NPC's won't appear until you will reach certain point of area. Maybe it was designed like that for some reason, maybe it's an engine limitations.Now, AI. It's fine. Sometimes soldiers can be dumb, sometimes they can do something clever. Unlike Peace Walker ones, these guys can detect you much more easily, which is good. Alert system is same derp as it was in PW - combat mode enables not when soldier calls to HQ, but when he screams ""CONTACT!!1"". They can only call reinforcements through HQ, alert by itself is almost instant. At least this system effectively punishes player for being spotted, unlike old games where skilled player can take down guard before he will be able call to HQ.Another innovation is a helicopter that you can call through your iDroid or by throwing flare grenade. There are few landing spots, two of them located outside of military base and the other two are inside of it. Two zones inside are good for quick evacuation, but of course landing there will trigger an alert(it's kinda cool how it's triggered towards chopper, you still can be undetected lol), soldiers will try to take down chopper with RPGs and Anti-Air Emplacements(which you can destroy before calling the helicopter). If you are entered alert mode, helicopter will be detected even from ""safe"" landing spots. You can extract prisoners\soldiers and yourslef through helicopter(another option is leaving a base through ""end of the mission zones). Basically this helicopter replaces Fulton Recovery system from Peace Walker and recalls a truck from Portable Ops. Too bad that Fulton will return in Phantom Pain.CQC got better compared to Peace Walker - CQC chain isn't that OP as before and there is no OP roll from previous titles(it had long range and knocked down enemies, you could even stun them like that lol). Also now you can just mash R2 button and watch how Snake wrecks poor soldier. You still can grab from both back and front, which is bad, it makes grabs too easy.The most weird addition to gameplay is sprint - you can dash by pressing L3, which also makes more noise. BUT. Dash is endless. There is no stamina bar, you can run like that till end of times. Also you can dash when carrying someone and dash animation goes through carryed person. They must fix it by making dash limited and remove dash ability when carrying someone.Health regen is another bad addition to the game - it would be much more fun to search for rations and medical supplies than just hiding in the corner and waiting until ketchup will dissapear from your screen. At least it doesn't makes you invisible as it was in demonstration of the game long time ago. Also you can be critically injured, it makes screen blurry and colors it in red tint and you can hear sound from previous MG games that indicates that you are low on health. In this state you can be oneshoted by anything and it won't go off until you will heal yourself through using spray, which healing animation takes a while. This crititcal state balances health regen a bit.Now lets talk about our equipment. We got iDroid device that allows to listen to the cassete tapes which contains dialogues, important information, or just some music. Also you can watch map and set marks in it. Second we have binoculars, that are allowing to zoom picture and look around. It also allows to listen to the guard's dialogues or another sounds from certain place. Our starting gear is rifle with flashlight silencer and OP tranq pistol with silencer, I hate that thing since MGS3, at least it had bad accuracy because of laser sight in MGS2 and was rare as hell in Portable Ops. There are few weapons that you can pick up from soldiers or from certain places, such as rocket launcher and sniper rifle(thanks god that this one not equipped with silencer and tranq rounds). You also have empty magazine tothrow them in the guard's headdistract enemies, few types of greandes, knife(which is usable only in grab) and NV goggles.Where are the cigars? C'mon Hideo.Graphics are fine. Facial animation is very good. PC version optimization is godlike.Worth buying."

And thirdly, if you've actually played MGS, you're going to buy it anyway, since this serves as a prologue to The Phantom Pain. Which is coming out...who knows. It took 6 months for GZ to be ported over to PC, so take that into consideration. Whatever, fantastic game, thanks based Kojima (and GabeN for letting this game get ported over)"

I really wish Steam would implement a middle ground choice.**Being a noob to the MGS series, I felt that this was a pretty good place to start, based on the very positive reviews (especially when talking about the optimization of the PC port). I was excited to try it out, and after a couple frustrating hours of trying to fix control bugs, I was in.First of all, the game is drop-dead gorgeous. Kojima Productions really shows the modern-day AAA dev how to make a PC port correctly. As far as I can tell, the game as a whole runs beautifully on almost any gaming machine you throw it at. My mid-high range system runs the game maxed out at 50-60 fps consistently. The production values really shine through on this one. The cut-scenes and voice acting are just as ingaging as the gameplay itself.Being new to the series, I had a little trouble getting into the mind set of a MGS game, but once I was there, I was hooked. The controls feel really intuitive and moving Snake around the open enviornment works really well. From what I can tell, this entry takes the mechanics of previous MGS games and puts them into an open-world eske enviornment, where you can take on missions the way YOU want to play. Want to feel like a spy, infultraiting a base with high-skill and finesse? You can do that. Want to go in guns blaizing and blow up every red barrel in sight? You can do that too. Most likely with little sucess, but you can do it. This is a really good look at how MGS V The Phantom Pain will play.But that's the problem. The game feels like a sneak peak to The Phantom Pain. I felt as though I did very poorly in the game, dying a lot and I only really focused on getting to my objectives. And still, my game time came out to around 1.5 hours. I don't really feel like I got my moneys worth, even at the $13 sale. Now keep in mind, I've never played the MGS series, so that may alter my final views on the game, but from what I played, I feel like this is an overpriced demo. If it was $10 normally, I would have no problems, because I feel that even with the short play time, the production values and the quality of the port make it worth that.But seeing how that isn't the case, I would be very careful recommending this to someone. If you are a fan of the series and can't wait for the Phantom Pain to come out, go ahead and get it. You will probably get more enjoyment out of it than I did and justify the $20. But if you aren't a fan of the series, wait till it goes on sale around $10 again.Don't get me wrong. I really did enjoy my time with Ground Zeroes. The gameplay feels really nice, the world it presents is gorgeous and complex, and the production values are through the f***ing roof. But since the game's total play time doesn't neccesarily coinside with the normal $20 price tag, I would have a hard time recommending this game to people who had a similar gaming background and taste to my own.Pros:-The world is immersive and drop dead gorgeous-Hands down one of the best optimizations of a PC port from a AAA dev in the past several years-Fun and exciting gameplay that allows you to play MGS the way you want to play-Amazing production valuesCons:-No benchmarking mode(this game really deserves one)-IMO the amount of content won't be enough to justify the $20 price tag-I experienced some bugs with the controls making the game unplayable, but eventually fixed them. Seems to be a case by case issue that can be patched in.-If you are a huge MGS fan, go ahead and get it. If not, wait for another decent sale.-"

I enjoyed the PC version much more and I do recommend you buying this on Steam.It is quiet different from any other Metal Gear however this isn't a downside at all. It has improved on the downsides to previous games and made a masterpiece which is Metal Gear Solid 5.Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain make up MGS5 with Ground Zeroes being the prologue to The Phantom Pain. With this being said, Ground Zeroes is considerably shorter compaired to most games. With this taken into account, the price is $20 which isn't bad at all for the short but execellent build up in the story, the couple of hours that it takes to beat the main story, the few hours for the side ops. Thankfully, all of these missions have replay value in by: getting a better score, unlocking more rewards, and being able to experience the fun and intensive gameplay.I highly recommend buying this game. The kept us waiting and it was well worth it, now just time to wait for the Phantom Pain :p"

,Recommended,311340,32139743,Posted: 2 June,all,Machine977,"This review is spoiler-free.First off, if you're new to the series, get yourself a PS3 and play MGS1-4 and then Peace Walker for the true Metal Gear experience. You may enjoy GZ and TPP for their gameplay even if you don't do this, but you'll be missing out on half the enjoyment of these games which lies in their story.MGSV:GZ is, as everyone says, a short game. That being said, it is my favourite Metal Gear game in the entire series, when you compare each game relative to its size.There is only one main mission that affects the story, however for those that are interested there are a couple more that are almost as good, despite their irrelevance towards the Metal Gear story.It took me 30.2 hours to 100% this game, which shows that it isn't too long, even with all of the content. However the content that is actually there is golden. Metal Gear is one of my favourite game series, however every entry has its flaws, which vary from game to game. GZ has the least out of them all, possibly due to its short length, but it is tight, crisp, and nothing that is actually in the game disappoints. The game is complete, runs well, and is smooth all the way through.In comparison to The Phantom Pain, which many criticised for its story, GZ is in my opinion actually far better, relatively. TPP did not finish development, and a fair amount of missions were mere filler, which meant just makingsomeof the game's missions a bit harder. GZ on the hand gives you trials (fastest completion time, time for enemies marked, etc) and hard difficulty foreverymission. Each mission in GZ is different from the last and the only similarity between them is the actual location itself.The cutscenes, gameplay, voice acting and story are all beautifully crafted and tie Peace Walker and The Phantom Pain together perfectly. Don't play The Phantom Pain without missing this, lest you miss out on a critical part of the Phantom Pain story.Overall, the entire game is a wonderful experience. The only flaw I can find apart from its length is the lack of cardboard boxes (a cardinal sin in the Metal Gear universe). Make sure you buy the definitive MGSV experience, giving you GZ for the same price as Phantom Pain alone (???)If you already have The Phantom Pain for some reason, I'd recommend waiting for a Steam Sale, as most would not think this game is worth it at its full price."

What you're getting here is a stealth playground to explore and take down in countless ways, with a wide variety of new objectives unlocked.The back story, story and postlude are great. Make sure you stick around for everything after the credits.You'll know when you've reached the last scene when the unlocks come up on their own.Mechanics are great. Enemy reactions to discovery are varied by degree, but less severe than I was expecting on my first play-through (normal difficulty). Yet of enemy reactions, there were some good, unexpected twists, turns and gotch'yas as well. I played with a Xbox gamepad, which I had no issues with. Solid performance, great looking and for a single mission there certainly plenty to do.If you've never done MGS, give this a whirl. Keep in mind that you can get both this and the Phantom Pain bundled together now, so don't get this if you intend to get the Phantom Pain, get both in one package instead.I'd definitely play this prequel again."

,Recommended,311340,14956860,"Posted: 19 March, 2015",all,Phylo,"What can I say about this game? It's masterfully ported, has fantastic graphics, almost seamless controls, tremendous atmosphere and plenty of replayability. The story, while intriguing, is admitedly rather short and won't be of any significance or interest to those who haven't played Metal Gear Solid 3 and/or Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker. Both of those games, while dated, are fantastic and well worth playing even today. Especially considering Metal Gear Solid 3 is considered one of the best games ever made.Back to Ground Zeroes, the gameplay is superb. Sneaking through enemy territory has never felt so simple yet effective. The controls, regardless of whether you are using K+M or a controller, are spot on. The quality of this port in general really is a testament to Hideo Kojima's dedication to the world of gaming. Especially when mainstream games like Far Cry 4 and Assassin's Creed Unity are casually thrown onto PC with little-to-no optimisation before release.As far as I can tell, all the returning characters from Peace Walker are still voiced by the original actors (aside from Naked Snake/Big Boss, who is now voiced by Kiefer Sutherland rather than David Hayter). Naturally, they all do a very good job bringing their roles to life.A common complaint about the game is the recasting of Big Boss. David Hayter's voice has become an icon of the series and many felt that his replacement was detrimental. I am a Metal Gear fan as well so I may be biased in my opinion of who is better. Personally, while David hayter is undeniabley the voice of Solid Snake, I feel that Kiefer Sutherland does a fantastic job as Naked Snake/Big Boss (For the uninitiated: Solid Snake and Naked Snake are two different dudes, they just look identical for reasons you will learn if you play the first Metal Gear Solid (wink-wink nudge-nudge)) and I wouldn't have it any other way.In in all: This is an amazing game for those familiar with Metal Gear. For the uninitiated however, I strongly advise that you play MGS 1, 2, 3 and Peace Walker (maybe even Portable Ops if you like, although it's not at all necessary) before you think about trying this one.Also, you'll definitely want to play this before The Phantom PainVerdict:For the Metal Gear fan: 9/10For the newbie: 7/10"

,Not Recommended,311340,29281618,Posted: 15 January,all,FinalFoxX,"So, rather than just tell what this game is, let me just break down the whole MGS V issues:This is for you Kojima Zealots out there who think MGSV can do no wrong:First: What military parody game does not have select fire? Seriously What Game? You guessed it, MGS V.Next: Mechanics are completely ported from Sniper Elite 3, except in Sniper Elite 3, controls weren't complete dogcrap. Also in Sniper Elite 3, a Sniper Rifle actually did damage and killed people, ya know, what sniper rifles are meant to do. Also, if a sniper rifle in 1942 has elevation markers, why the heck does a highly funded mercenairy group in 1980 NOT have them?Continued:- Vehicle physics are like from a bad Nintendo 64 game, and I mean bad, rush 64 would play circles around these physics.- Silencers last for 8 or 10 bullets. Really?? Okay, here's a tip: If you want to limit the silencer use, don't give the player 200 rounds of ammo for a sneaking mission, Kojima even throws supply drops for the player. Major Face Palm.- Game is horribly balanced from start to end. A lot of side missions require items that need to be developed, like c4 or rocket launchers.- Speaking of items, missions don't give you squat for intel. They don't tell you if you need a vehicle or a companion, if you need explosives or tranquilizers. You first have to play the mission, realize you screwed yourself, restart the mission, and watch the long cutscene all over again. Often missions are timed, so you don't have time to request supply drops.-Speaking of ammo and items. This game is NOT a sneaking game, nor is it a MGS game, but we'll get to that later. This game is 100 times easier to run through and shoot people in the head, complete the mission and get the best score. It is infinitely more difficult to time patrols and use cover to cover. It doesn't even reward you for sneaking through the mission, as opposed to not sneaking. They should have just used MGS 2 and 3 sneaking gameplay and enemy radio tactics, at least those were more stealth oriented. Now if you are discovered, just blast your way out, no big deal. Instead, there should be attack choppers and armored troop carriers that come and drop search patrols off, ya know, making it more of a risk to get caught sneaking.- Speaking of sneaking. The negative quirks of this game are beyond frustrating. All games have bugs and issues with them but, on top of the already unrewarding sneaking system, there are plenty of times a player will get seen through objects and obsticals, making it even harder to sneak through an area and even more necessary to take the enemies out.- Speaking of failed sneaking. One thing that irritates me is that there is an option automatically set to on that if you fail Kojima's horribly designed gameplay, it forces you to wear a chicken hat like, rediculing the player. But in reality, I'm like, ""Great, now on top of a horrible gameplay system that is frustrating the heck out of me, the game is now insulting the player for it's own faults. Awesome.""- Speaking of negative quirks: I think it's great that you don't have to play as Snake, as you will find out that Snake's character development almost single handedly ruined this game, almost as much ast MGS4. The game let's you play as other people who don't have a giant rock sticking out of their head, that is also somehow possessed, growing when you kill someone and shrinking when you punch a sheep (Gee, I wonder who decided this was a good idea). However, when you need to change back to Snake, to continue the story, you better be ready to load 5 different maps to get to the equipment screen, and then back again.- Speaking of Characters. MGS is consistant in at least one thing, the degregation of female protagonists. It started out strong with Sniper Wolf and Meyrl, all with great plot points, motives, and theme songs. Then we went to Emma and whats her face with the rail gun, who had a passable plot points but at least provided adequate drama. Then we went to Eva, who didn't have the best back story but at least it made sense and her persona fit her spy character, she also had nice looks (Oh and the Boss, but we'll get to her later). Now, we have Quiet... an over powered character design with no personality or good looks (if that's your thing).- Out of the characters and into the story: It's bad. Not the worst, but bad. Luckily, Kojima had already destroyed Snake's persona in MGS4, so him destroying it even more in MGS V doesn't matter a whole lot to me. Here's the thing, when the story opens it shows Snake's implied self mutilation of a snake scare on his chest (to represent his sorrow for losing the Boss and taking her place). Okay, it's been how many games since MGS3? 3? 4? Plus a digital comic? C'Mon, get over this already Snake, she didn't even have a great backstory or motive to begin with. Now it's just a huge cringe every time her name comes up. Just drop it already. To cut things short, Kojima has introduced a plethora of horrid elements to Snake's origin story, so much so, it's the point where it's about time Snake should be perminately killed off and forgotten completely.And, the icing on the cake is seeing Kojima's name every half hour on the screen and in your face. Gotta love that. Could he possibly be any more narcisistic?Now, is this the worst game of all time? No, by far no. In fact, this game has A LOT of good elements. It's just every moment you almost think you can get into this game, something incredibly stupid happens and the game not only punishes you for it, it also makes fun of you for it. Do you want to spend your money for something like that? Well, that's up to you."

Other than that main mission you have 6 more side ops to do:-Eliminate the Renegade Threat: Neutralize two targets for an unknown contact, then escape the area.-Intel Operative Rescue: Aid in the escape of a high-value undercover operative from the base.-Classified Intel Acquisition: Make contact with an informant, then retrieve the data and escape.-Destroy the Anti-Air Emplacements: Destroy three AA guns to make way for a U.S. helicopter assualt.-Deja Vu: Users sees Big Boss recreating scenes from the original Metal Gear Solid (1998).-Jamais Vu: Drops players into the shoes of Raiden (MGS2, MGS4, Revengeance) as he investigates a very strange occurance on the U.S. base in Cuba.I thought my 2011 laptop wouldn't run this game but I was wrong, It can. This is with any doubts a AAA game and a really great port. If the port of The Phantom Pain will be like this one, I won't buy a desktop and more people will enjoy this masterpiece at it's fullness. Thank you for this port Kojima Productions, you won't regret porting it or any Metal Gear game for that matter.Score: 8/10+ Great PC port and game!-  One short canon main story mission only in one small open world area, some minor buggs too.Congrats to Kojima Produtions and Kojima himself once again."

Right off the bat I saw the minimum specs were a 2GB GPU and a i5. I have a 400 dollar Asus laptop with the following specs. Overclocked AMD A8 4500m APU, 8GB of ram, windows 8.1 64 bit and a 750GB HDD. While that is way below the specs koami is asking for I took the plunge and was hoping that well if a old xbox 360 can run it then it wouldn't hurt to try. To my surprise I was right that the specs were not correct but here's the catch. It seems like the minimum specs are for a solid 60FPS. My target was 30 just like the last gen consoles but with DX11 graphics at native 720p and not upscaled. I left vsync enabled since its not too demanding or badly coded in this game. textures low, model detail on medium, SSAO enabled on high, lighting on high, texture filtering on medium, shadows on low, did fullscreen mode and not boarderless fullscreen too. Now here's the catch. When I set screen filtering to anything higher then low it caused huge FPS drops. I noticed that feature controls AA, depth of field and motion blur. With that setting on low I was getting between 25-32FPS during gameplay which is still better then last gen since they dropped to a locked 20FPS all the time and sometimes dip into the teens. All in all you do not need crazy specs to play this game if you are willing to tweak the settings and accept 30FPS. Heck the game is still drop dead beautiful and now i'm debating if this is better looking than Battlefield 4, crysis 3 or ryse son of rome on my laptop. I hope you guys enjoy the game for what it is and people know this isn't the next crysis lol. Now get gaming guys :D"

Least to say, the price tag for the PC version is definitely reasonable in this case and the visuals have only improved with the addition of PC hardware. Running this with maxed out settings on a GTX 770 (2GB) and an i5 3570k clocked to 4GHz and 8GB of memory, so far I've had pretty much a constant 60FPS though I've heard people running AMD hardware struggle a little bit. Even the control scheme isn't that bad, though personally I still prefer the use of a controller as some of the default binds (Holding up people forces you to hit 1, 2 or 3 to talk to them instead of just tilting the mouse towards the options) are a little iffy and are awkward to remap. An outstanding example of how a port should be done, especially from a Japanese studio.TL;DR You're pretty good."

While it does good at showing what the engine and the semi-open world game will be like again separating the content from the core game which ended up being heavily cut anyway shortened TPP even beyond what it should have been.At least GZ has some old Kojima odd or quirky gameplay mechanics later on in GZ after you've beaten some side ops and S ranked them.  Compared to TPP's Side Ops, GZ's are somewhat less repeated, they are repeated because you're using the only area that you can use where as TPP you have 2 whole areas to use and Kojima just reused so many major land marks and bases in TPP for all 150+ Side Ops.  For that GZ's off shoot side ops or goofy missions were better, not well done mind you, not very fun but at least it seemed like they tried, unlike in The Phantom Pain.If you must buy this buy it on sale for 5 bucks or less, NEVER pay Konami full asking price for this ""demo"" ever or you are doing a disservice to your fellow gamers and your fellow consumers."

This should be fixed pretty shortly though, hopefully.Other than that, this is a pretty amazing port, especially for a Japanese game, I assume most of us went through the nightmare of trying to play Dark Souls on PC. This has all of the graphical options you'd expect of a AAA PC title, including borderless window which many games lack and I don't know why. All that's missing is an FOV slider, which may potentially get added, but as it is now, the FOV is wide enough that it's more than playable and I didn't even think about FOV until another poster mentioned it.I believe the minimum specs are a little misleading, it says a GTX 650 is a minimum. I'm on a 560ti, which is roughly equivalent to that, and I'm getting 60~fps, with no stuttering, on high settings  with a few mediums, and the game looks gorgeous, although it is possible to crank it much higher.There's a nice backstory section on the main menu which explains all you need to know up until this game, plot-wide, in a couple of minutes (11 or so short paragraphs, explaining from WW2 and the original Boss up until the current nuclear inspection of Snake's base). It explains it far better than anyone whom I've asked to explain the plot to me in preparation for MGSV.Mr. Sutherland makes a great Snake voice actor, arguably matching the character and personality of Snake more than his predecessor, and a lot of the exposition that plagued previous games (or so I hear, I know MGS2 was awful for it) has been removed, so dialogue is short and to the point. Loading times are short, surprisingly short considering I have a dying HDD. All in all this seems to be shaping up to a pretty amazing port of a pretty amazing title, provided they get the start-up issue sorted (this is being written on release day, so all things considered it's a pretty smooth release as well, compared to some other AAA titles)"

The game is set up like a television show with a series of episodes in a season. Where one mission in the game would be one episode. When you start up the game you go through the main story and then in less than thirty minutes, it's already over. Whereas with other Metal Gear games, you are given a butt-load of lore, story and gameplay in advancing the game. Then in order to satisfy your hunger for more Metal Gear, the game gives you side missions that don't really expand on the world you're limited to exploring; like filler episodes in a show. The base this game is set at gets boring after a while, even when doing the other side missions that are supposed to appease. Overall, the game is okay. The gameplay is incredible and the story is amazing, but what holds it back is its limit. Everything is just too little. After finishing, it feels more like a demo than an actual and complete game. It's a good introduction for people trying to get into the Metal Gear franchise, but for others who want to actually play a full ""Metal Gear"" and enrich themselves within the massive world that the series has expanded upon for over twenty-five years? You would have a better experience playing Phantom Pain than this."

The main mission is, sneak in, find and extract your first target, then find and extract your second target.  Your options to approach in all instances are entirely up to you.There are many unlockables, difficulty modes and time challenges.  For a ""demo"", there is so much content. I would agree with others that it is more like packaged DLC.  The side missions do place you on the same island, but give you objectives to complete that offer more insight into the story of the base you are doing your missions in.  If anything, it's showing you how the open world aspects of Phantom Pain is going to work.Graphically this game is amazing.  Highest settings possible and this game still runs smooth like silk (at least on my system).  I think the keyboard controls, which are akward at first.. are well done.  It was confusing to grab someone and have to press two other buttons to navigate menus.  But after getting used to it, I'm fine with it.  I dislike using a gamepad.. and normally it's impossible to play a stealth game without an analog, but they were thoughtful enough to map the ability to walk even slower using your keyboard!10-15 bucks would have probably made it easier for people to not ♥♥♥♥♥ about the price.  It's got me really psyched up to buy it on launch."

The mechanics are amazing and I felt like I was learning new things that I had no idea you could do 30 hours into it. The game offers interesting, skill based challenges that test the player in every way.New comers to the series may be disappointed with the story considering it takes place directly after the events of Peace Walker. You'll be left almost entirely in the dark even if you listen to every single cassette tape.Fans of Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker will feel right at home here as the game is a huge improvement in both graphics and gameplay. Unfortunately the ""Fulton Recovery"" system has been removed, forcing you to transport prisoners and enemy soldiers by foot (or car) to your helicopter, one of the things that made Portable Ops a pain. You now procure weapons and items on site instead of selecting them before battle. Each mission you're still given a ranking from D to S. CQC has been improved to allow you to rip weapons right out of enemies hands to hold them up. No more stun rods meaning this game is back to it's rated M world. No more punches pulled and no more tickle rods for torture, this is the real deal.Sutherland's voice is good, but under used in comparison to the amount of voice acting Big Boss had in Peace Walker.  Even in the tapes he rarely speaks and it's a little unsettling given how much of a talkative character he's been throughout the whole series. It seems like he'd be better suited for when Vic Boss becomes ""Punished Snake"" in The Phantom Pain because at this point he should be David Hayter still given the fact the last game took place a mere 5 months earlier.In all, the game is a near perfect stealth-action sandbox. You can go loud or quiet and either option is viable. There's a great deal of things to learn and the PC controls are easy to get into. I would recommend this to hardcore fans of Peace Walker without a doubt."

It is almost nothing like MGO2 which was the best of them all. MGO3 has much smaller maps and is much more fast paced with less in mind for the CQC and stealh players (the true Metal Gear fans). They have gone for the main stream shoot em up type of game. This isn't call of duty, keep Metal Gear what it used to be. Here is a list of things MGO2 did better.- Better room creation (Name, description, options, etc)- Host migration- Text chat- Clan system- Friendly fire- Tag/Find friends in lobbies- Block players- Could mix and match several items/outfits- Use nades while on a ladder- Backstep, sideroll, side-strafe (FPV)- Hold ups in TSNE- Play dead- Worm crawl- Stealth camo made you invisible with the exception of your weapon/knife- Could be completely invisible with stealth camo by saluting/playing dead/worm crawling- Improved CQC (could choke out by laying enemy on ground in order to avoid detection/fire)- Could pick up and move enemies once stunned which also dropped their weapons- Fire Mode (burst/single/etc)- Chaffs- Set camo's per map- More codecs and able to preset additional ones on an external keyboard- RES/DM/SDM/SNE/CAP- Knives- Drum can / vomit- Set marker ""!"" on map using the ""enemy sighted"" codec- Animal rank based on performance- Teammate can boost you up to higher platforms on maps- Stunned enemies go to sleep longer & required several 'taps' to wake up (waking skill helped)- Could tell when stunned enemy/teammate would wake up via stamina bar- Able to use codecs while stunned - caused player to mumble in sleep hinting to teammates enemy was close (useful in TSNE)- Could actually hide in a box and get away with it due to several boxes scattered around mapsThe only reason I am still playing MGO3 is because of my hopes that it will one day regain some of what made it good.

Speaking of realism, the enemy AI are programmed to reflect what any well trained soldier would do. when i first started playing i though i could let them see me for a second , in order to lure them to me, but instead they reported in which lead to the others enemys being more catious. This is the perfect metal gear solid and I hope that the main reflects the brilliance of this demo. wouldn't say this a 10/10. Closer to 20/10."

,Recommended,311340,21223078,"Posted: 14 February, 2016",all,Duv,"Went in disheartened, came out surprised. Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes isn't really a full game, as much as its a demo. Oddly enough, I played this game after Phantom Pain. Going into it, I expected much of the same, boring repetitive tasks with few interesting things to use the great mechanics on. But in the end, this honestly felt like a better Metal Gear experience than Phantom Pain turned out to be.To start with the mechanics are very similiar to PP with very minor differences, that oddly enough felt better than PP's mechanics to me. The camera doesn't shake when sprinting, melee combat feels better, stealth and enemy AI felt better. The stealth and AI feel better mainly due to the setting. Instead being sent into an open world with many half-baked guardposts and three good ones, you are confined to one large, fleshed-out, and ultimately better base to infilitrate. It feels very well put together and the guards locations and behavior seem natural leading to a better awareness of where I am and where I should go. When you get caught, unlike the reinforcements from PP which don't seem to do anything at all, there is a set guard number at the base and it will increase by a bit when other guards call for reinforcements, and it feels better this way.Although now in a more first-person shooter oriented style then a top-down stealth style, it feels just like any other Metal Gear entry. Where PP to me just felt like a larger version of Shadow of Mordor now with guns, this feels exactly like a Metal Gear game, we're just in first person this time.There are only two things lacking from this game. The first being that its short. It should only take you around an hour to clear the main story. You can play the side mission which are great to, but the main game as you should know going in is very short. Obviously, the main game alone isn't worth 30$ as great as it is, so you really have to play the side missions and to the extra objectives to get your money's worth. Secondly, time for the main story wouldn't be that much of an issue if it had a better conclusion, not so much story wise but gameplay wise. The story will end on a cliffhanger and then feel a little unsatisfying, not that the story was bad, but there was no big conclusion to what you did. It could have been a boss battle or even just a well designed stealth segment taking place taking place in a unique part of the map, but  the main game ends with you rescuing Paz.Overall, this game exceeded my expectations and was amazing. I would definetly reccomend it should you buy it for the entire game and not just the main game, otherwise it won't feel like its worth thirty dollars. Although the price is a bit iffy for how short the main game is I still reccomend it, and if it goes on sale its definetly worth buying."

At $20 I'd say this is a worthy by (I picked it up for $5 when it was on sale) but you get more out of it by on repeated playthroughs as you'll get additional objectives to complete and such.This is the prologue campaign to The Phantom Pain and does a good job of setting the stakes for The Phantom Pain, if you're on the fence maybe wait until it's on sale, especially if you only plan on playing through it once before moving into The Phantom Pain.Like TPP this isn't a great port, you're key bindings will show on Xbox controller but there are community guides that will show you the real button layout. How Konami thought shipping a product like this without very basic UI elements and options is beyond me but in my experience this tends to be the norm for PC ports sadly enough.

Essentially you're ganing something very special by playing this game first which is hart to put a price on.It packs a LOT of info on tapes you'd want to listen to, playing this game will allow you to get the full picture of what happened before MGS5:TPP and the events that led to the famous game. Essentially this is the way to go before you play MGS:TPP, you WILL thank me later. (especially if you're a fan of the series from previous years).Also it gives you goodies for it's big brother, mainly cool suits, and even hideo Kojima himself as a base member.It includes replayable different missions you can do to enjoy the game, including easter eggs from previous games.BEWARE - it's the prequal to the MGS5 phantom pain. if you're just looking to play it AFTER MGS5:TPP, you might wanna buy it on 10$ or less. it really depends on who/where you are that the value of this game is set.It's great and the gameplay/story are really sweet, even thought short.LONG stuff you dont have to read:I got it for the full price of 20$ and i was still overall pleased even with the short gameplay. i feel it should sit on 15$ at launch and 13-10$ now (2 years after release. 1+ year after the big full MGS5 game was released)While the MGS5 game got me 100 hours for 60$, this gets you about 4-10 hours total. 20+ if you're a completionist.Again, if you're a kid with 60$ and you hadn't played any of hte MGS games or don't like this kind of stuff, you might wanna skip this if it's above 10$. However if you're an adult - buy this, it's a few dollars more than it should be, but worth it. you don't always buy the cheapest car. so from a purely experience point of view - buy this and play this before you buy MGS5:TPP."

First the controls are awful. If u scope with sniper rifle the slightest move with the mouse will cause giant movement on the scope making it impossible to snipe. If you're climbing something you have to be at the correct spot or Snake will go to a totally different way. (and cause you to get spotted most likely). The AI is also a bad joke. Stealth is not an option. Enemies spott you from 150 meters away at the moment they look at you. Not only that but maybe the biggest bullsh*t is the fact if one enemy spots, you the WHOLE base goes alert the moment the enemy says ""contact"" which is so stupid, i mean in there is no way that other enemies would be aware, if someone 100 meter away says contact. He doesnt even use the radio or other enemies dont see or hear him, and wholw base alert status, radio tells there is an intruder on base... It doesnt matter if u kill the enemy if he spottes you before death he will use his telepathic skills so tell the others about you after death.Ok lets talk about the freedom of playing how you want this game.Well short story: you are this game's b*tch.Long story: After mentioning the terrible AI and controlls, you cant play this game with stealth on the first try. You have to gun down enemies, then after you are familiar with the map and enemy patrol, then you can play the game with stealth.Rank system, sins of all game which contains it:Ok. Most games which have ranks system usually tells your rank after beating the whole game, and giving you a bsaic idea how managed it. I dont like rank system in games because i want to play the game how i want, not have the game developers want to me. <<<---- AND this is the part where this game (and peace walker) really shows it sh*tiness.You CAN NOT get S rank if you DO NOT play the game how it wants you to play it. Slightest f*ck up and you have to restart. (on HARD you cant even use checkpont because you will lose enough points to lose S rank).Okay you can tell me taht S rank is for hardcore nerds, that will master these controls and deal with the AI.My biggest problem is that some funny guy, thought it is good idea, to make into achivement and to 100% the game beat every mission on S rank... I mean wtf this game is meant to playby hardcore no-life nerds with neckbeards and stuff or what? If i beat this game on A rank everymission without really trying (ok some i did with S rank with no problem), but i barely feel rewarded. You get every glory if u beat everything on S rank, i mean whats up with that.So finaly: i guess everyone wrote it but i will confirm game takes very little time to beat so buy it on sale.TL:DR: Unrealistic AI, bad controls, minimal fun. Dont recommend buying, unless you're a MGS fan like me, then buy it on sale, beat the game in about 1 hour and be done with it and go play Phantom Pain.

But the most annoying thing of all, is that sometimes I speed run missions and get this close to beating word record time and still recieve an ""A"" rating... The problem isn't the rating itself, but rather the system, see, this is the same exact thing that ruined the Hitman series, in Blood Money the rating was very fun to play with, you'd always recieve a different rating based on your playstyle and if you didn't care about the ratings it was still pretty easy to ignore, but on Absolution they changed that, they introduced and shoved down the players throat a score based system, and no options to turn off, it was really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying to have a big♥♥♥♥♥score telling me what I'm supposed to do and how I'm supposed to play.Well, other than the rating system I really like MGS:V GZ, or should I say, Spotted Through Walls: The Game, it's really fun and challanging (especially with all the glitches and AI problems) but if you're looking to get 100% completion and all the achievements I'll have to opose that, I sincerelly do not recommend this game if you're going to try to finish it clean, since some of the ""trials"" are almost, if not impossible do to (no seriously, not joking, depending on the map/enemies behavior layout you just can't do some trials, you have to restart the game and hope for the layout to change) therefore you'll probably get very mad very often, it really messes with your head, I do not recommend that to anyone."

So you should play entirefranchise of MGS series to understand compex sotry behind Snake who is cloned from Big Boss, governments, cold war and what nobody likes to talk is what happens to people on battlefield and after they survive it. What is left of man when he fights between two storms and none is good, only difference is what kind of evil will replace different kind of evil. There is no victory for humanity in the end of day only domination of one force above other and special interest shifting between them which is mercenaries like Big Boss. As we can see in prologe American base (black site) is on communistic soil in Cuba fighting against communistic Russia or SSSR doing to prisoners same things as SSSR which is hypocrite of hypocrisy.So for young players I recommend this game as one of best games with story, gameplay and Hideo Kojima even says on his site KONAMI that this is result of deep reasearch so most parts from game are made by real events or inspired by real events.I will finish my review on graphic and gameplay later."

However, I found it to much more than that; My most recent MGS game being 4 at it's release in 2008, I felt quite rusty going into this. Ground Zeroes is a good warm-up for MGS5, consisting of six missions that take place in the same ficticious Cuban military base, Camp Omega. The ""Ground Zeroes"" mission is the meat of the story, involving the rescue of two minors on opposite sides of the base that were apparently major characters from Peace Walker. Interspersed cutscenes and collectible cassette tapes flesh out the character's back stories and their experiences on the base. The extra missions provide vastly different approaches and playstyles to infiltrating (or assaulting) the base, ranging from a helicopter ride providing covering fire to an assassination mission that fails easily if you are even spotted. After you finish each mission there's still plenty of unlocks and time trials for purists, along with the last two missions for waxing nostalgia.Ground Zeroes helps to connect the events of Peace Walker with MGS5 and acts as a catalyst for the time jump been the two games. Overall, this probably won't win over any new fans but is a thoroughly fleshed out ""VR Mission""-style side game that provides a solid intro to The Phantom Pain."

But with reflex it could get hard aswell.- The cutscenes feel sloppy (Unstedy cams, maybe meant to be, but not cool to look at)- Soldiers in Camp Omega has no voices, WHY? (MGS3 every soldier had a voice, makes this game feel cheep)- Could have gotten more stealth sidemissions in the night, most of the side missions are in daytime and not that fun- Kazuhira Miller and tutorials, just won't sh*t up (pardon my language)+ The game main story is 1 - 2 hours long, but that only gets you 18% THIS means replayability wich is good.+ SIDE MISSIONS!+ Fun gameplay+ Steady 60 FPS with a mid range GPU______________________BOTTOM LINE______________________________________________________9.5/10 - Recommended for those of you who have played some MGS games before and like the stealth genre :)"

It is far from perfect however.For a start the entire thing takes place on one map which during the main mission and side quests funnel you into this one specific building which always leads to the same tedius event over and over again. Sure the game play is fun until you land that one objective which means you have to find your into this building for the fifth time. Only to be left with the same awkward guard patrols etc.The keyboard/mouse controls are a bit stiff and I personally found that using a controller was more to my liking. I think the character responds quicker with the controller.The game itself looks incredible and the voice work is fantastic. It runs smooth at the highest settings on my fairly old rig which really says something about the developers. If this is the quality they can put into this ""demo"", imagine what the main game is going to be like.It is worth playing through this before the main game, however it does come with some pretty annoying flaws."

Lets address the elephant in the room. This game is pretty much a paid demo. It's short and all missions take place on one map while only one of those missions is canon. This doubles as a prologue and is required if you care about what happened between Peace Walker and The Phantom Pain. Where this game lacks in quantity, it makes up for it in quality. The gameplay is a small portion of what to expect from The Phantom Pain and it's the best in the series. From a technical standpoint, it looks really good and runs shockingly well. A lot of love was put into the PC version. A tip, never pay for this at full price unless you're a die hard fan. This is pretty much a demo that you pay for."

No multiplayer, no weapon customization, very few items/unlocks, you'll probably have seen everything meaningful in this game before that 1 hour of disgusting story is over to begin with, and have very little incentive to go back and do the side ops.This was a demo to advertise MGSV, it should be free, it should also be included with MGSVPP for free, which it isn't unless you pre-ordered.  If, for some nonsensical reason, they absolutely definitely at gunpoint had to stick a price-tag on this game to prevent their children from being used to make IRL versions of the torture tapes presented in it, I could maybe accept paying $5 full price for it, not the $20 its currently priced at, certainly not the $40 it originally released it."

The silencer is quick and effective and allows you to dispatch your enemies with skill. The stealth is well done but can sometimes be cheap with enemies spotting hidden dead bodies when they are 20 ft away. Most of the side missions are well done but the the action ones can be a bit frustrating due to the fact that the game is design for stealth and not for action making your health low. But I would not reccomend this game because of the story, poor value, and sometimes cheap AI.  The main reason I can't reccomend this game is because of the story which is quite sick and messed up. The story follows the main character Big Boss breaks into a military base in Cuba to rescue two character named Chico(who is 13 years old) and Paz. You eventually learn that the base is a torture and intergation base where the main villian Skullface tortures the prisoners. When you rescue Chico you see that he has been nailed to ground how sick right? You then later learn in the game that Paz has two bombs one placed in her stomach which you see graphicly get surgically removed and one in her vigina which explodes killing her. You also get a tape in  which Chico and Paz are forced to have sex. Sounds entertaining right? I love video games and which in depth stories but this one is sick and ♥♥♥♥ed up. I have never seen such sick concepts in a game before in my life. This makes all GTA's sexual content look like Shakespere. The story alone makes me not recomend it.

Picking this up on sale when its a fiver is worth it though, but THIS IS NOT A DEMO. Consider it a prequel, of sorts.Graphically it is quite nice, however expect to get a little sick of the one base you play your missions on. Texture quality is fair, and the animations though odd at times are a significant improvement on previous MGS titles. It's a good port in that sense. There's little animation which irks me, try jumping off something high while diving, Snake will land like a cat. There is a lot of pop-in still, which I expect to be fine-tuned with the next release but if that's a sticking point then beware! Remember they have had significantly more time for MGS V: The Phantom Pain so it will probably be much smoother.I'd recommend a controller, but you can play the game fine with mouse and keyboard. Everything is responsive and draw distance means aiming is generally suited to your weapons effective range. A quick note: don't try to shift-tab in order to chat to friends, or Snake will pop out of cover.The main mission is short, if you know what you are doing. Collecting misc items, trying out weapons (the gunplay is solid) and collecting prisoners (all of them) significantly extends the game. Listening to tapes adds a few more hours, and they are generally worth it. Try getting S-Rank on everything, to have access to weapons at the start of missions and you will see the AI shine.Content-wise it is good value for money (on sale) as you'll have access to lots of cassette tapes exploting the characters of the Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker who are still in The Phantom Pain. You can get Peace Walker on an emulator and knowing it is sort of necessary to appreciate the depth of the character who appear in Ground Zeroes.The main problem with the game is the price, and Snake trying to be a cat sometimes. Getting the game on sale is wholly worth it, the engine is solid as is the gunplay and variety in misisons because of the AI not being potato (though it still has its moments). If that still isn't enough, then I would recommend watching an in-depth stream on Twitch to get the story down. I would recommend because it, as a game, stands on its feet. For a fiver. A penny more and you, good sir, have been swindled."

Other reviewers mock this a bit as being a tech demo - which isn't entirely unjustified. I think I could see this being part of the upcoming Phantom Pain instead. For it's current price tag you get some solid yet a bit short-lived stealth action. The motion capturing looks fantasic and Kiefer Sutherland sounds great even though he hasn't got that many events to comment. This and Phantom Pain may be the most adult - or ""wise"" - and thoughtful Metal Gear games I'll be playing. All of Kojima's games seem to have a certain overarching theme, in Ground Zeroes he apparently wanted to criticize the U.S. and imprisonment facilities such as Guantanamo Bay. You infiltrate some U.S. outpost in Cuba during the Cold War era rescuing certain VIPs and, if you want to, random PoWs. The main mission can be completed very quickly or within some hours depending on what style of play you prefer. There are some collectiables but really aren't that many, and their content can easily be looked up on YouTube or the sorts. Some of them one may already know from Peace Walker as they seem to have been copied from that game (audio tapes). Your actions are rated when the mission debriefs, rewarding you with additional gear or collectiables if you do well enough. There are side-missions and time trial challenges (with online leaderboards) too but while they may happen at different times of day and weather it's always the very same base you are infiltrating, making efforts to give different feelings and interestingly changing objectives and obstacles to overcome but ultimatively recycling things you've already seen in one way or another. So, if one wants to see if he can run Kojima's Fox Engine on his machine (Ground Zeroes runs very smoothly on mine throttling down some specific graphic opions and even keyboard controls feel as if a good amount of thoughts went into them), get a taste for the upcoming Phantom Pain and loves going for any kind of collectiables or hunting for highscores this is a good buy. If someone is seeking a full-length stealth action title better look elsewhere or go for Phantom Pain right away once that is released."

,Recommended,311340,13482068,"Posted: 20 December, 2014",all,J4MESOX4D,"Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is a prime example of how a PC port should be. Not only is the quality of the game of a very high standard but the technical execution is top-notch that puts other developers to shame in this market. I am a massive Metal Gear Solid fan and I hold the utmost respect for Hideo Kojima and his Konami team who have delivered once again; a breathtaking title with huge care and attention. Their loyalty to fans is admirable in what has been a very difficult year for gamers and gaming as a whole.The ambition Konami have and their passion for games make this prologue a great purchase and a welcome warm-up for The Phantom Pain. Some may argue that this is a glorified demo but there is enough content here to guarantee hours of play and substantial replay value. The main portion of the game is a single mission with a simple objective; rescue two hostages from a military base. Other missions within the same base called 'Side Ops' can be unlocked which add plentiful more hours to the game. Completing the main mission and additional operations can unlock extra missions, equipment and collectables. Also you'll be eager to improve your completion times and mission grade based on performance. Although the military base is central to the whole game; it is massive and offers many ways to complete the tasks on offer. The objectives are varied and even the night/day missions add a whole new dimension which keeps the game fresh.This title is a fantastic introduction to the forthcoming MGS V and gives gamers a snippet of what can be expected. The cinematic quality is of a remarkable standard as expected and the gameplay is a welcome taster of things to come. The Phantom Pain will be '200 times the size' according to Kojima and I believe him as his honesty and professionalism throughout his career has been spot on and it's wonderful to see him embracing the PC market once again. Whatever you think of this 'game'; Konami deserve so much credit and respect and their product deserves to be purchased at such a generous price."

The camera can also be a little sporadic in confined spaces but is just what you need most of the time. I can't really fault the combat controls, just running rampage is just as fun as the sneaking and hiding.I'd probably recommend this to anyone, but would mention in advance that it is really just one area. There are other missions to select after completing the main mission, but they are at different times of the day, in different positions and also include completion rankings for you to unlocks new weapons and equipment.I got in a sale a little cheaper but would definitely say it's worth buying and playing, especially if you can't wait for MGSV: The Phantom Pain."

Do not listen to the people reccomending GZ for $20.  The people who defend this price point have pathetic standards.  The issue isn't if you will enjoy GZ, you probably will.  The point for $20, could that be spent elsewhere for more enjoyment and the answer is absolutely yes.You might see some whining about the lack of a story in TPP, which is hilarious because there is hardly any story in GZ either.  Just youtube the cutcenses, it will take less than 10 minutes and you will have saved yourself some cash.

Here is the reason I don't like this game.The backstory which you could read was not the best I ever read. In my opinion it was bad.Now gameplay and game. Here is how I rank a game in price range.If you can (in the quickest way) finish a game in one hour it's worth 10 EUThis game (I messed around a little) took me the total of 77 minutes to finish on the first and ONLY story missionI do not count in side missions here. Side missions never count towards a story seaker like me.That means that it's wort in cash would be around 12-13 EU in my opinion. Instead it's worth 40 EU. I Baught this on sale for 19,99 EU so I should have atleast another 33-43 minutes of gameplay and story left. But no no no no the story is 1 just 1 simple mission. (but they locked the hard level so you can play for another 77 min and get your moneys worth)This leads me to an other problem I have with the game. I WANT TO PLAY ON HARD THE FIRST TIME THROUGH!Granted not the easiest sneaking game I ever played but surely not the hardest eaither.Other than that Awesome cinematics, great graphics and a pretty good story for the first part of something. But I would recommend you to wait untill summer buy it on the Summer sale for 75% off and then enjoy it.

The theme is extremely dark, and not in the melodramatic ""war is hell"" way that the rest of the games are dark. More in the sense that established characters are brutally tortured and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥just to prove that the bad guy is really mean.But that isn't why I'm writing a negative review, because from what I've seen in the other discussions and reviews here, nobody seems to care about any of that. I'm writing this review because everyone else seems to be in complete agreement that the gameplay in ground zeroes is perfect. I strongly disagree.Despite all the changes this game has gone through relative to other games in the series, Ground Zeroes is still a stealth game. When you are discovered, the game tries very hard to make you feel like you screwed up. Your options are generally either run away or die. Most of the game basically requires you to be unseen in order to accomplish your objectives. But the stealth in Ground Zeroes is extremely unforgiving. Enemies can easily see you from very, very far away. Often before you can see them. Enemy placement is not at all predictable, as most of them are constantly moving, and patrols frequently come from other parts of the base. Missions frequently take between 15 minutes and half an hour, and if you want to unlock the optional content and S rank every mission, a single mistake will probably mean you need to start over. S-ranking a mission in this game requires that you either spend hours memorizing the patrol route of every guard on the map, or look up a video walkthrough online and try their path over and over again until you don't make a mistake. As someone who enjoyed the other MGS game, and S ranked every mission in Peace Walker, I find the gameplay in Ground Zeroes to be extremely frustrating."

Honestly, I was expecting an old school feel or atleast a Metal Gear solid 3 feel.. Absolutely terrible.. No real story line. You have a choice between 5 casual missions.. All in the same level. Which makes absolutely no sense.. Like they wouldn't notice the same helicopter fly over the damn military base 5 different times.. The only thing that varies is the weather.. and they didn't even do a good job on the rain lmao..Probably the biggest let down I've ever had.. I played for 3 hours.. attempting to stealthily kill every target only to find out that you could basically rambo/commando style the entire mission. Eventually you would have to because once the guards were alerted you were basically ♥♥♥♥ed.. Slight realism but the ai was so terrible anyway, it didn't matter..Not a single mission even made real sense. You're not sure why you are dealing with any of the missions given to you.. It feels more like a mercenary game... Did Konami just give up? They make PES so good but this game they just♥♥♥♥♥♥the bed and all over the wall...1/10 .. not a zero because I want nothing to do with even the title of the game."

The enemys act pretty stupid, they react to not silenced gunshots, but they don't hit nor work together. So I ran arround, shot a few lights (not all are destructable), did a couple explosions shot a ton of enemys and thats it.Playing the whole game stealthy would take about an houer I guess, and due to the new reflex-function its pretty hard to be sucessfully spotted anyway (well unless you run arround with blazin guns as I did).If it'd be a free demo to promote shadow pain it would be great, but as game to pay it is not worth buying in my opionion."

Now people call this a demo because of its short length but it is more than just that it contains a lot of content in the form of backstory from peacewalker snake eater and portable ops, while it does have a story mission the rest of it is either in the form of a time trial or diffrent objectives on the same map yup you read it right there is only one map while it is small to medium in size the ammount of exploration and varity within the mission will keep it fresh not to mention the weater system and time of day. When this came out on consoles earlier this year people were outraged at the asking price of $40 Kojima adressed this by lowering the price and this is why we are paying $20 USD now (lower now beacuse of the day 1 and winter sale) this price im sure will please any fan of the series but if you are new to the series and are looking for a sandbox like stealth game at a low price this is it while you may not fully understand the story behind it or the characters it offers intuitive controls on both keyboard & mouse and xinput controllers (just remember to press enter in the main menu before pluging in your controller everytime). So if you feel like this game is not worth the asking price then don't buy it but if all this seems interesting enough to get a taste of The Phantom Pain then go for it!

Not really, they were like whatever dude, just a random unidentified chopper landing in our base, probably no connection whatsoever with that guy that just killed 40 of our guys minutes ago.

The aiming is sensational, perhaps easier to use than COD. Certainly feels much more like a ""Professional/Legendary Soldier/Mercenary's"" touch, as is the case with most of the MG series. I wish I could Congratulate Kojima in person with a NES copy of Metal Gear and a Hammer, for him to break it with. I'd be glad to do it for him.(Because I hear he hates that version.)It's a beautiful game, movement/gameplay is certainly quite familiar to any MGS3, MGS4 and MGS Peace Walker players. Binocular vision could use a toggle option, and all in all I like playing it.Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is a Tech Demo compared to most games being sold on steam for the same price. Gameplay is splendid, but it lacks many basic features of full games. Such as Multiplayer, a single player campaign, and lots of other goodies. It's fun to replay, but it's good to remember that at the end of the day, this is a tech demo. I'm sure you could have the same amount of fun time on just about any other demo they give away for free.Knowing this, despite the exemplary gameplay and fine aim,I cannot honestly recommend this game to anyone.20 dollars should fetch you a glorious single player campaign and multiplayer, not a demo.40-50 dollars should grant you a dream come true.

The graphics look good, and the game might end up being fun game play wise, but i only played 30 mins before calling it quits.Things that annoyed me about this game...The mouse does not work on the menu. There is a mouse cursor that you can move around, but you can not use it to click on any menu options. Arrow keys and Enter only.It feels like the game is still setup primarily for console control with keyboard controls being second. There is even still an option to enable or disable vibration feedback. Why do i need this on a PC? And before you say maybe someone wants to hookup a controller to their PC to play id say, um no, they would already be playing on a console instead of the PC.Custom keyboard mapping is severely limited. Basically you can only use the letters. It would not let me use any keys on the Num keypad, the home, end, insert, delete, backspace, enter, { } [ ] ' ; "" : , . / < > ? - _ = + \ | *It did let me map the mouse middle button to `weapons reload`, but then during game play that button change camera location from left to right shoulder so i couldn't reload and had to pick another key. And the action of changing camera location isn't even in the custom key mapping screen to change away from that mouse button. I could not map my keys in a way that was comfortable and allowed my fingers to easily reach keys without having to look down and reach across the key board. Why would you not allow all keys be used in custom mapping?There is an action to `Dive` which puts you on your stomach. However it only works if you are running and then hit the dive key. WTF? Stealth game right? You can not lay down on your stomach to crawl around without running first? Hey bad guys, im about to sneak up on you so look at me running and drawing attention to myself.The mouse movement to turn the direction you are facing is very squirrely. When trying to use an action like climb a ladder or pickup a weapon you have to be facing the item in a sweet spot to be able to hit the action key even if you are standing directly over it. So when you are moving fast trying not to get caught, dancing in circles while standing over an item trying to get your squirrely mouse in the sweet spot, can get frustrating fast.By this point i had enough frustration and just gave up trying to play it. Not being able to map my keys how i like them and get into a comfortable grove just ruined the game for me. I spent more time messing with awkward key layout then being able to get into the game play.But hey, the graphics were pretty. Nothing better then COD:AW or Farcry4, but i guess to some the graphics is more important then game play."

The fact is this product simply is not worth the money, even at €5 it's asking for too much.There is so very, very, very little content here. The main mission can be beat in less than ten minutes if you have a slight idea of where to go or get incredibly lucky by way of finding the objective or it can take an hour if you haven't a clue where to go and blindly roam around the level. After you do that you have, literally, the same repeated level with four different missions(Basically side missions) that task you with doing stupid objectives that account for nothing of the overall game or TPP and two ""Secret"" side missions to unlock that are absolutely pointless.The level itself is extemely small and very limited, composed of two camps and a main HQ area which is smaller than both camps. You can only go into one building. That's not a lot of content.This can be beat in ten minutes. If you have no idea what to do it can take around thirty minutes. The cinematics last longer than the actual game. The plot? This is the ""plot"": Continued on from Peace Walker(Which is a PSP game and who gives a ♥♥♥♥ about that?), Snake rescues Paz and Chico(Which you need to know from the previous game -- again, a PSP game that most people haven't played or even care to play and isn't referred to in TPP), Paz gets blown up, the helicopter crashes and then the credits roll which heavily advertises The Phantom Pain.The whole mystery of ""How did Snake end up the way he did in the beginning of TPP?"" His ♥♥♥♥ing helicopter crashes when leaving the mission area. It's not exactly a shock unveiling or at all that well built up. It just happens and it could have EASILY been explained in the opening intro of The Phantom Pain by having a nurse or the doctor simply say ""After your helicopter crash...""It's simply not worth it. It shouldn't have even been a demo. It should have been a side mission for the main game. To think they charged €20 for this and people actually bought it is disgusting.

The graphics are gorgeous with some nice lighting effects and good use of DoF.The controls optimization for PC is different story altogether, the controls are clunky at best, default key binds are odd, no optimization to use extra mouse buttons or the scroll button. The menus are not at all optimized for the KBM users, no scrolling with your mouse, menus are not clickable, menus within menus within menus with millions of confirm dialogs.The basic gameplay was fun, but quite short and I fell, that it certainly was not worth the 17€.Pros:Unbelievable optimization for the PC, the game runs smoothly without any FPS drops.Great graphics and sound effects.Realistic bullet drop.There is more than one way how to finish the mission, so there is some replay value.Cons:The game is short, there is only main mission and few more side ops, all in the same zone. This might not necessarily be a bad thing, because of the replayability, but there will be some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off people if you don’t put a big warning in the description.The AI in this game is quite stupid, those soldiers with rocket launchers will often kill themselves or their teammates.Guards on the towers ignore killed / disabled enemies on the ground, even when they have clear line of sight.Skull Face… seriously skull face? If you have to go for tacky villain at least slap a cape on him…Some features from previous games seems to be missing, leaning corners, ability to shoot weapon / radio out of someone’s hand, knocking on the wall, etc.If you stack more than 3 disabled enemies, they will disappear, it is easy to forget somebody on the ground who will appear later just to be discovered by patrolling soldiers.Soldiers can see through some walls or closed doors.The save (checkpoint) system is well weird at best. If you load checkpoint you sometimes get spawned in completely different area, even one you have not visited yet, on top of that some enemies will rise from the dead and man their posts again. You also hear the scripted radio communications every time and it gets old really quick. The random spawning happens even if you specifically run to the place where the game saves.Game does not adjust the mouse speed when zoomed in with scope or binoculars.The camera is abysmal in some situations, often you can’t see anything at all. Especially some tight spaces are really tough on the camera control.No mouse navigation in menus and iDroid (iDroid, really?).The grab / interrogate / kill menu is terrible.Menus within menus within menus WTF?No support to bind actions to your extra mouse buttons.There is no sound menu (2014 WTF?).Do we really have to confirm everything in the menus 3 times?My mouse has a scroll button, please put it to work.Not the best KBM controls, you can line up a headshot point blank from the cover, adjust for the targets movement and watch the bullet magically miss.No separate key for ducking? Why isn’t the jump assigned to space by default? There is no button to go to cover, the game randomly decides whether your character will or will not jump to cover.The gameplay hints / command tutorials doesn’t adjust for KBM users, the controls are displayed for controller only.The helicopter can carry infinite amount of enemy soldiers."

,Not Recommended,311340,13480527,"Posted: 20 December, 2014",all,Gian Lorenzo Bernini,"We'll start off with what's obvious from the get-go: This is a drop dead gorgeous game. It's beautiful. There are some really neat lighting effects and water looks great. Solid textures and some nice depth of field effects as well. It also runs terrifically on my setup. It's probably the single best PC port I've played since Splinter Cell Blacklist. It's a refreshing change in an industry that's given us duds like Assassin's Creed Unity that are hardly playable at high settings even on a strong setup like mine.That being said, I have a number of complaints about the game. I finished in 4 hours. It's absurdly short, more a demo than anything.In a lot of ways this franchise hasn't changed much since the second game, which is admittedly fine in some areas. I consider myself a longtime fan of the franchise -- Metal Gear Solid is probably one of my single favorite games of all-time. Fans of the series love the exclamation points, the cardboard boxes, and the weird, preachy stories. I'm no different. I love all that stuff, I eat it up. And it's important that the series doesn't lose its identity for the sake of progress. But there are some features of the series in this game that just plain haven't aged well, and that's where most of my complaints come from.My biggest issue with the game comes from the foolish way checkpointing is laid out. Imagine you carefully and meticulously move halfway across an open yard of tents, taking care not to be spotted, only to slip up near the end due to hitting the wrong button. Now your last checkpoint forces to restart a football field (about 100 meters for our European friends) away and retrace your own steps. You also get to hear the same introductory codec message every single time, too. Not good.Checkpointing is a holdover from older games that really does a lot to damage the experience here. There's no reason a semi-open world stealth title shouldn't have a save anywhere feature. Hell, the option to save via a codec message isn't even present in this game, so why even have checkpoints at all? It doesn't make sense to use them over a manual save function. This isn't even a question of save scumming, it's just a matter of modern convenience that Konami seems to have forgotten. I have the same issue with the Far Cry series. It's 2014. There's no excuse for these games to use checkpointing when they'd be far better served by utilizing a dynamic save system. Bad checkpoints are some of the most frustrating things in gaming, and it puzzles me that developers still use them when there are obviously better systems available. Seriously, checkpoints are down there with escort missions. Game developers: Kill them immediately. Please. I despise them in games, especially in stealth games.I had some serious issues with the camera as well. There are times when you've got a roof or some kind of structure far over your head, and the camera needlessly zooms straight into the back of Big Boss's head. Why? It's nowhere near the ceiling. It doesn't work well with cover, either. It was frequently a pain to me when I would be creeping between small spaces, such a between cargo boxes or tents. I'd stop at a corner, move up into cover, and try to get a peek around the corner to see if a soldier was there. And more often than not, the camera would refuse to comply, just sitting closely behind Boss's head. They obviously knew that this was an issue because they included a shoulder switching camera mechanic, which rarely seems to do much. I was detected a few times simply because I was frustrated with the camera and decided I was sick of fooling with it, so I moved out. It's ridiculous to me that the camera is an issue in a game these days. I can't remember the last time I even had camera issues in a game at all. A poorly controlled camera is an issue that belongs 20 years ago in the N64 era. Not in a modern, next generation game. It's inexcusable.Another holdover from the old games that seriously bothered me was the control scheme. There are menus within menus within menus when you've got a guard grabbed or when you want to customize weapons. You're holding a bumper, or flicking a stick, or pressing some random arbitrary button that just doesn't feel natural. The worst part about these menus is that there frequently is just no need for them. Games like Blacklist have featured the same types of things but made them vastly more simplified and intuitive. I find myself having to check the controls screen multiple times per session because I can't remember how to do something. That's a sign of having an unintuitive, overly complex, poorly designed control scheme. Movement, furthermore, is hampered by having a weird crawl/crouch/stand system, including a weird button to dive to the ground, which I didn't really understand or ever feel any need to use. Then there are a bunch more controls for when you're crawling. You can roll to the left. You can roll to the right. Hold a button to crawl more quickly. It's all just needlessly complex, and it feels tacked on when it's not really necessary.There's no free climbing in this game like there is in other stealth games of the past few years -- And I'm not saying that it needs it. But movement in open-world or semi-open world stealth games like Blacklist, Dishonored, or Assassin's Creed, for example, has way more dimensions than it does in Ground Zeroes due to the distinct verticality in the form of climbing (or blinking, in Dishonored's case) up to platforms or roofs. It's nearly always present no matter where you are, and you know so intrinsically how to accomplish it that you don't have to think about it. Dishonored teaches you to blink once, and you've got it down. Assassin's Creed teaches you to free run once, and you remember. In Ground Zeroes, you can only really move up or down when there's a ladder present. Otherwise, you're moving simply on the ground, back and forth, to and fro. It doesn't have the verticality of those games. So why are the controls so damned complex and involved? It's how it's always been in the series, but with the advent of newer games with great traversal systems, Ground Zeroes' controls feature so many aspects that just seem totally unnecessary, and it only serves to muck everything up. I can't help but feel a simpler approach would have been far more successful here. Having an intuitive understanding of movement and being able to act without thinking is absolutely paramount in stealth games where being seen can lead to a very quick death, and I never feel like I have that down when I play this game. It's something that would come with practice, sure, but why should I have to practice at something that I can intrinsically pick up and do in pretty much every other game in the genre?Look, I don't want Metal Gear to become Splinter Cell. I'm not saying that at all. But the step forward that Guns of the Patriots made in 2008 was excellent, and it breathed new life into the gameplay of the series and really saved it from becoming too dated. Gunplay was far better in that game. It was always wonky and unintuitive in the older games, with its weird go-to-first-person-and-then-aim thing. It never felt natural. You always felt like a bumbling idiot when you were trying to shoot somebody, and Solid Snake was supposed to be an expert with a firearm. Guns of the Patriots completely fixed that. They updated their gunplay to a more modern, third person shooter type system, and it worked fantastically. That is the type of step Konami needs to take with things like movement and checkpointing. Ground Zeroes, unfortunately, doesn't take that step. It just feels like a way prettier Guns of the Patriots. Which is certainly not a bad thing, and don't get me wrong: This is not a terrible game.If you're a Metal Gear fan, buy it. You'll like it. But if you're just looking for a stealth experience, I'd heartily recommend Splinter Cell Blacklist over this game."

I killed everyone in my sight and the game, after sending 2 waves of easily dispachable opponents, declared the area to be ""clear, and suspect lost"" so i just ran to the next spot and repeated.at one point i was in a tank in the middle of base shooting all the waves of enemies game threw at me till they stopped coming. and again the area was declared ""safe"".... all while the hostage i was supposed to prottect was safely chilling next to my tank as i proceeded to slaugher innocent navy seals...so basically, if you take away the cutscenes, and go in guns blazing, you can finish the game in something like 25 minutes... as a veteral splinter cell player I would call Bulls*it on ""stealth gameplay"" element of this game...perhaps that is harder to do on ""hard"", however that doesn't really add to the replayability of the damn thing.Thank god there are extra side missions to play after that so it's not a complete waste of money (even with the discount)but as far as the main story goes it looks more like a demo of a game.

Also I shouldn't need to know about controller instructions when I don't have one plugged in.Anyway I began the game with no knowlegde of its backstory; I didn't play any of the MGS games nor do I want to read the backstory text in a video game, because I assume that a 95% positively rated game with a Story Rich tag and seemingly high production budget will provide an in-game cinematic storytelling. Nope. I was horribly offended when the credits began to roll because I have no clue who the protagonist 'Boss' was and why he was tasked with the mission on the island and how he was relevant to Scarface and his entourage and to the 'plot'.

,Recommended,311340,18962411,"Posted: 8 November, 2015",all,Ishmael,"Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is a small chapter that serves to tie up the MGS: Peace Walker storyline and acts as a bridge between Peace Walker and MGSV: Phantom Pain.It plays like a mission from Peace Walker, but the graphical and game play improvements make it feel much more like MGS4. Honestly I would have said that it is basically a tech demo of what Peace Walker might have been like if they had designed it for a full fledged console instead of the portable handheld system. The dialogue and information that you hear from the tapes is deeper and darker than most of Metal Gear has been so far, Big Boss and Kaz are much colder and less caring than they were in Peace Walker. Certain other returning characters are portrayed differently than they were in PW.The Ground Zeroes map is rather small when you compare it to some of the older games, but it was never meant to be a full game…and there is a lot to keep you busy on this one single map. There is the initial story play through, and when you finish the main story mission there are a whole bunch of bonus missions with different objectives. Finally there are two unlockable bonus missions (there are normally one each for Xbox and Playstation but PC got both of them) which are fun missions that are mostly fan service referencing older games in the series.Overall it handles and feels like a properly done Peace Walker, but the modifications to the tranquilizer gun and the new reflex system have significantly changed things. The tranquilizer gun while having a permanent silencer has lost a vast amount of range and the 3rd person targeting system for it has also become a bit more complicated. You have to get much closer to enemies for the tranquilizer dart to work and you start off with a very limited amount of ammunition. Now that MGSV is out you should get this if you want to fully understand the story. It is a decent (but short) offramp which introduces MGSV."

If you are the kind of player that likes to get the best rankings, complete trials, repeat mission a few times over or a fan of metal gear solid, I would only reccomend this title if you find it at a low price. The game (or should I say demo) was designed to give fans a preview of what was to come in MGSV but there's not a lot of story the game gives you and the main mission itself can be completed in 45 mins (10 mins or faster if you know what you are doing).

The next installment in the already magnificent Metal Gear series is a true predecessor to titles before it. The game LOOKS GORGEOUS, and is extremely well optimised, so frames rarely drop. The gameplay is fast and fluid, with really responsive controls. The newly implemented reflex mode, which slows time when you're spotted by an enemy, giving you a chance to shoot them before they raise the alarm is a welcome feature. Many a time have I been wandering in a metal gear game only to be foiled by unnamed grunt #465. All in all this game gets a solid 8/10 for me. Solely based on its short gameplay for a ridiculous price set by Konami."

For every mission I go to the same military base, but with different task. I infiltrate from the left, from the right, from the top and from the bottom. I go in loud, I go in quiet. I play on normal difficulty and on hard, but always at the same military base. In that sence, it lacks variety and becomes a bit dull really fast.The game breaker for me came with the fiddely controls. In order to do something, the game needs to detect that I am in the correct position to do it. For ex, grabbing a person without killing him so I can interrogate him, or placing an C4 on a AA gun. The problem is that the game mostly fails to detect that I am in the correct position. I have been killed in game many many times lying/sitting/standing next to the target I need to interrogate without being able to grab him. Im so close that I can't get any closer, yet I can not grab him. Of course he spots me, the alarm goes off and I'm dead.I have also spent quite some time figuring out the best time and way to sneak up on an AA gun without being spotted on hard difficulty, Just to end up sitting next to the AA gun, surrounded by enemys who have not yet spotted me, with an C4 in my hand but without the game noticing that I should be able to place it on the AA gun. Thereby forcing me to circle around the AA gun with my nose scratching it - but still not being able to plant the C4. Of course, after a while someone spots me, the alarm is raised and I'm toast.With this happening time and time again, i've grown tired of the game really fast. Bit of a shame, even if it's not a the full Metal Gear Solid V game. The thing is that the game has some replay value, but it's utterly ruined with the above mentioned problems."

Getting the biggest ""problem"" out of the way: Is knowing that it isn't a FULL Metal Gear experience and yes, it is short compared to other titles of the series, but know you will not find yourself disappointed in the slightest.Story and gameplay wise: Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, is very well built game and for a short game, the is alot to do in the game. From taking on the 7 missions in total and learning more of the series lore and what to expect in MGSV: The Phantom Pain to challenging yourself with normal and hard difficulties, with variations in length depending on the main objective and how much you want to do yourself, you will probably find a good amount of time into this game, plus the more you complete the game's small challenges, you receive some nice unlockables for both Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain.The graphics are beautiful right off the bat. I honestly don't even know if I'm running on max, but the new FOX engine runs brilliantly and it looks amazing, runs perfect, best of all: it rivals any console version.Overall, I've gotten a lot of enjoyment from Ground Zeroes. Yes, the $20 price tag is a little high but at a discount it feels just right. Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is a great stealth game and It is a must own for any Metal Gear fan, one  that I do not regret adding to my collection."

I have an ""entry-level"" 4k setup with a Haswell i5-4670K OC'd to 4.2Ghz, 16GB DDR3-1600, and two GTX 970s (typically in SLI). Starting this game up for the first time, it defaulted to 3840 x 2160 Fullscreen windowed with all settings at high and medium. I was getting between 48 and 60fps. I'm pretty floored by these results. Typically, the only games I can run at 4k with decent to good framerate AND good visuals are PC-only games such as Arma 3, Assetto Corsa, and hell, even Goat Simulator. This multiplat game looks and performs amazing at 4k. If this is a taste of what's to come with The Phantom Pain, we're definitely in for a treat. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."

Lighting, and the Detail around the map scene. It's quite almost the same as PS4. I can running on 60FPS without dropping. mostly detail in the game are rendered very well. Maybe a little bit glitch on the Level of Detail stuff. But that doesn't seems to be a big problem and not really taking you into trouble.The controller for PC is quite good. Some is weird for me but it doesn't bother me much. Somehow you'll adjust as what you want instead. and the game mechanic quite good. maybe it's hard for many people to play.

Kind of like how the tanker chapter in MGS2 was a prequel to that game. Even though it's just a prologue this game is amazing.I've heard complaints from crybabys like Angry Joe that the game was too expensive at release. I think it was about 40-50 dollars at release. Paying that amount of money for a game with an hour long campaign is kind of crazy. But this game is not meant to be played just once and be done with it, there are a lot of side-missions and some hidden collectibles that actually are difficult to find.I'm going to start with the story and if you haven't played every other Metal Gear game before this, get out. Go out of here, find MGS HD collection for PS3 (I choose PS3 because reasons later), play Metal Gear 1 and 2, download and play Metal Gear Solid from PSN, go back to HD Collection, play MGS2 and MGS3, find a PSP, play MGS Portable Ops, go back to HD Collections play MGS Peace Walker, get a PS3 play MGS4, you can skip MGR:R because it's not important.If you play this game as your first Metal Gear, you are a stupid cúnt just like Angry Joe.Now, the story takes place 10 years after Snake Eater, following the Groznyj Grad incident with The Boss' death, and only a year after the Peace Walker incident.After he fulfilled his mission he was awarded the title of Big Boss. Now he his still sad about The Boss' death, which is understandable because The Boss was the only woman who he ever loved. Big Boss has met with Kazuhira Miller, commonly known as Master Miller or just Master. Big Boss and Miller has started a private military company called Militaires Sans Frontières, translated Soldiers Without Borders. They got a mission to go to Cuba and drive out an unknown well-armed army. Yadayadayadayada. Big Boss finds out about a nuclear deterrant called Peace Walker, skip lots of story, it turns out the AI of Peace Walker is based on The Boss. At the end of the game is turns out the ghost of The Boss took over The Boss AI and drowned Peace Walker. The credits roll, but there are more story stuff after the game is done.Turns out Paz is not a 16-year-old Costa Rican high school student, but a Cipher agent, she hijacks MSF's  Metal Gear ZEKE. Big Boss destroys it, she flees, gets captured by XOF, then this worthless kid Chico goes after her and he too gets captured. It's up to Big Boss to rescue them and the story is now in MGSV: GZ.I'm cutting the story here, there's too much shít.The gameplay is really good, if you play one of the newer MGS games you will have some serious problems playing MGS1, 2 and 3.The stealth is more realistic in this one compared to the other ones, you don't get to change your camo to decrease your chances of getting spotted.In the main mission it's at night and it's raining, it's pretty easy to not get spotted, but all of the side-missions play during daytime. It's sweet.The music is pretty good, sound effects are also pretty good. Even the random conversations between soldiers are interesting. Not much more to say about that.The game also looks ♥♥♥♥♥ing gorgeous.My final score for this game is actually 10/10 because it's a Hideo Freaking Kojima game, and as we all know Hideo Kojima is the biggest díck G ever. There are also multiple ways of beating this game, like sneaking onto a truck to get into the Admin Building.I can't stretch it enough how much you shouldn't play this game if you haven't played all of the other Metal Gear games.This game is short and sweet.Even the bonus missions you unlock after collection all of the XOF patches are great. First one was originally a Playstation exclusive called Déjà Vu where you play as Big Boss, where you have to recreate scenes from Metal Gear Solid 1. Easily the best part of the game.The second mission was a Xbox exclusive and is called Jamais Vu where you play as 2018 Raiden, it's lame.If you are still here, reading this I've got to give you credit. This game is like the best game on Steam right now.Later, ♥♥♥♥♥ers."

This is almost like playing an early access to Phantom Pain where you get to get use to the controls, adjust things how you want, adjust graphic settings and so on. I am very statisfied with the game itself, and believe it is amazing. However I do feel as if it should be a 10 to 15 dollar game due to the fact it does lack allot of content. It is a 3GB download and everything seems to take place on the same base. Yes you get more missions however they are all done at the same base the same map every time. Not worth the 40$ they originally charged nor the 30$ they changed it to and quite honestly this 20$ price is still to much for my taste. If you want my advice just go preorder Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain for 60$ and you get Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes for free. That is the only way I feel like this game is worth the money. By no means is it a terrible game, the gameplay is amazing the graphics are amazing the story (what little there is) is amazing. However it severely lacks in content."

Once again, but, it is just as fufilling to play, as it is to watch someone else play it instead. Which you could do for free instead of paying $20. I can only recommend this to hardcore stealth game fans, or people who have money to burn. As for casual Metal Gear fans. I'd just suggest watching a playthrough because the amount of content this game has to offer is pathetic.

Released 9 months after its console release, Ground Zeroes is a solid PC port compared to Konami's previous efforts to bring the Metal Gear franchise to the PC as well as other video game companies attempts to bring their franchise(s) over. The game controls quite well with a keyboard and mouse but you may find yourself wanting to use a controller, which the game fully supports. The game also controls much better compared to the previous Metal Gear Solid games. Rolling around and sneaking through levels never as Big Boss felt so great and smooth. Stormy nights will effect enemies line of sight making it harder to spot you while sunny days require you to bring your best sneaking skills in order to slip past all the guards. Sounds also plays a huge importance just like the previous games.The story picks up after Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker which may confuse newcomers who just jumped into this established series. The game provides enough backstory through selecting the option 'Backstory' in the main game menu and through cassettes in-game, but doesn't really give you the full 'Metal Gear Experience' compared to playing the previous games. I'm not going to do too in-depth with the games plot as it's better to experience it for yourself.The main campaign in Ground Zeroes is extremely short, clocking in around 2 hours or less (depending on if you complete optional side objectives) but nonetheless players should find plenty to do within this short game. Included are four side ops and two extra ops, which has Big Boss sneaking around Camp Omega weeks before the events in the main campaign. The PC version contains the Xbox exclusive mission ""Jamais Vu"" which stars Raiden, as well as the the PlayStation exclusive mission ""Deja Vu"" which has players recreate scenes from the classic Metal Gear Solid.Progress from Ground Zeroes can be imported to The Phantom Pain allowing players to return to Camp Omega, recruit rescued prisoners into their Mother Base and a little more. The game is essentially a giant stealth sandbox, and very good one too. The original asking price of $40 seemed a bit too steep for the amount of content for what some could consider a demo, but that shouldn't scare you away from missing out on an excellent game, especially if it's on sale."

Then I got it for PS3 secondhand, and found it was more than a demo, it was a whole game on it's own, just not as big as your standard MGS title.This MGS game is centered around missions, much like the portable entries Portable Ops & Peace Walker. There's only a handful of missions, but some of the bonus content will have you working at for a while. The game controls wonderfully. It feels a lot more organic than the previous MGS titles.The story is great, but only if you know what is going on. I originally played this before playing Peace Walker, and I really had no idea who the characters were. It's still understandable without playing PW, but if you didn't, YMMV.An oh... the visuals. A++ all the way. It looked fantastic on PS3, but when I loaded it up on my gaming PC, it took my breath away. Draw distance is incredible, the way water cascades off of objects, the movement of the character models... it's all awesome.I highly recommend this to both longtime MGS players and those looking to delve into the series. Longtime players will enjoy the hardcore sneaking action & addition to the story, while new players will get to see what MGS is all about."

Metal Gear Solid has always been a favorite of mine, and while I question the validity of this portion being marketed as an expensive demo, I was actually pleasently surprised to find a large amount of replayability.The main mission act as a prologue to the upcoming MGSV: Phantom Pain, and in doing so introduces me to the portable versions that I missed. While I miss their cannon, the premise is easy enough to grasp. Rescue two hostages, and get out. Classic Metal Gear, it's never so simple as it seems.Finishing this scenario isn't the end, but unlocks alternate ways of tackling the island you prowl around. Lighting, weather, objectives, and utilities all change how you approach the game, as well as your attitude. It makes for an excellent playground, while also giving a good challenge and mind game for the stealthy.Performance for this game is excellent - I run a good rig with gtx970, but optimization is always the final factor, and it's here. Let's hope this is a good sign for the coming days! However, I will complain that KB/M support needs some work, with just a few more options to tweak. 8/28/15All in all, high hopes for MGS TPP!"

I enjoy the stealth system in Kojima's MGS games and this game brings it up a knotch further making it one of my favorites in the series - that is until the actual game (the Phantom Pain) is released. The gameplay is fun, and the graphics are absolutely beautiful. The interrogation is made even better and a lot less ""sensitive"" than seen in MGS IV. The only thing that I can say is a negative is the amount of weapons and weapons customization in the game. You pretty much only get 2 weapons throughout the whole game unless you finish each mission in which you gain 1 weapon. I realize this is not supposed to be a full game with a ton of content and stuff, but would it have killed them to add more weapons or something? Other than that, I think this is an AMAZING game/demo and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a quick taste of Phantom Pain before it is officially released."

We couldn't believe how amazing the full game was, when the demo was EPIC! Years later, we aren't much better off, but I was able to build a good PC and bought ground Zeroes.

While the actuall ""campaign"" will likely not take you more than 40 minutes if you are trying to do a perfect run, the meat of this game is what comes after. There is a large portion of the story that is acquired from ""cassette tapes"" hidden throughout the main story and most of the sideops, as well as story elements only gotten when special POW's are rescued or unique enemies are captured/interrogated, which is often tied to achievements which makes tracking them down a little easier. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that unique prisoners and enemies that are rescued will carry over to ""The Phantom Pain."" So in order to get the full story you need to complete all of the side missions as well as locate the collectibles and rescue/capture/interroagte all of the unique NPC's. While this may sound like a grind, it is absolutely not. The 25 hours i spent in order to get a 100% completion rate was enjoyable the whole way, and often required me to tackle missions in completely different ways depending on what my ulterior goal was. If you are just looking to see the main mission, you'd probably be better off watching a Let's Play, but if you are a real fan of Metal Gear and plan to 100% this game to get the full story, this is well worth picking up, especially if it is on sale.

You play as Big Boss (though everyone still calls him Snake), and the main mission, ""Ground Zeroes"", is to rescue his allies Paz and Chico, two characters introduced in MGS: Peace Walker, from a US naval base in Cuba. Snake eventually rescues the two, and after removing a bomb from Paz's stomach, his HQ of Mother Base is destroyed by rival mercenary group XOF, lead by the enigmatic Skull Face. Paz then jumps out of BB's chopper, then detonating the second bomb within her. The explosion blows off Snake's arm, as well as putting him into a coma.Gameplay: Like the rest of the series, Ground Zeroes is a stealth/action game. Snake has a lot less health than in other games, so staying in the shadows is quite important. Snake does have some tools to assist him, such as a tranquilizer gun, an assault rifle, a sniper rifle, and a host of other weapons. The controls are solid and responsive, and Snake himself handles really well. The game is not just the main Ground Zeroes mission. There are 6 other side mission, including a mission where you destroy some anti-air emplacements, another where you have to eliminate two targets. The missions all take place on the same map, so it can get a bit stale, but it is still an enjoyable experience.Buy This At Full Price?: A solid no. There is a decent ammount of content, but not enough for 20 bucks. The ideal price is anywhere from 15 to 5 dollars.Overall: This game is great. The story is fantastic and sets up The Phantom Pain really well, and the gameplay is fun as always, but the price is a bit too much when it comes to the ammount of content that you're given. There's a decent amount, just not 20 bucks decent."

Everything being the prequel story episode of MGSV.I think that Kojima wanted people to try these tactics of infiltrating so he can improve the enemy reactions at differents approaches. It's a ""Hey, try this"" for the players as well as for himself, and it's great how a producer looks at his players reactions to improve his game.That being said, it's maybe too expensive, but it's a first class game series. If you don't want to spend that much, wait for the 75% discount, it's the perfect game for the sale period."

It also removes the STUPID BULLET SPONGE bosses from Peace Walker. If you have played a newer Metal Gear game, then you will have to adjust a little. On the other hand, if you haven't played one since Snake Eater or earlier then you basically have a whole new game on your hand. The game looks and plays great. It is as good as the trailers, and runs better than even games from 2012 on my Asus laptop at 60 frames a second on the highest settings with no slow down.The story on the other hand is stupid. It really does not flow from Peace Walker in tone, and without spoilers really just does not work. Good thing it not as in your face as earlier games in the series, and this is by some one who loves the stories in Metal Gear. Most of the game is Side and Extra Ops, though. Most of the stories fun is in them, but they are really satisfying. Worth a couple of hours of fun.On length. This game is not worth thirty dollars. It is only worth 20 if you are a big Metal Gear fan. It really a glorified demo, but with Steam's reduced price it might be worth it. I recommend you wait until it is about 10 bucks.Hopefully this means that Konami and Metal Gear have finally been won over by the Glorious Pc Master Race. This is the first true Metal Gear game to be released on PC in 10 years. The HD Collection probably will not be ported, but maybe a next gen re-release. Knowing Konami that is probably going to be released any day now.The game is fun, and a decent intro to Metal Gear, but for those new to Metal Gear realise that even by Metal Gear standards, it is dumb."

,Recommended,311340,13575776,"Posted: 24 December, 2014",all,Mystia,"First and foremost: this is a game based almost entirely off replay value, collectable hunting, and playing for score. If you do not enjoy these things, you may just want to wait for The Phantom Pain or pick this up cheap.For the unintiated, Ground Zeroes is the first chapter to the Metal Gear Solid 5 narrative. The titular mission contains the actual plot and cutscenes you would expect from an MGS game, but be warned, it's the only mission with these qualities. The remaining handful of Side Ops and Extra Ops are basically fluff and so they do not contain very much story beyond basic briefings and ramblings over the radio as you play.These additional missions, however, bring quite a bit of variety to the table. Along with completely different times of day and weather (all of which affect guard sight and hearing), you're presented with brand new objectives of all sorts of espionage-y type things. Collecting intel, destroying enemy assets, extracting prisoners, assassination, and even some oddball fanservice await you. While all of these missions take place on the same map, it doesn't hurt the game too badly as it is a surprisingly deep area with lots of routes and techniques to be discovered.As previously mentioned, this is a game filled with replay value. A nice selection of collectables and unlockables are presented here, some of which even add to the greater narrative. Each mission can be played on Normal and Hard difficulties, which admittedly doesn't change up too much, other than guard perception and accuracy. Additionally, at the end of each mission, you are graded on your performance. Things like playing non-lethal, avoiding enemy alerts, and time taken are added up into a score and the game gives you a letter grade based on this. Interestingly, some missions actually have hidden objectives that you have to discover for yourself which add even more points to your score and even give you a collectable and narrative for your troubles.But what about the gameplay itself, you say? It's good, basically. Snake is a very agile and resourceful guy and it's presented expertly through the controls (of which, the mouse and keyboard work nicely, barring some small issues). You've got your basic stealth game movements like crouching and crawling, as well as a brand new sprint function and a very useful dive; handy for diving into cover just before someone catches sight of you. The CQC system has been overhauled and is now, quite frankly, far better. While some miscellaneous moves have been removed, it's just plain old easier to get Snake to do what you want now, rather than fumbling around and accidentally killing someone.Gunplay in this chapter is the best in the series, hands down. It's setup similarly to MGS4 but now much faster and easier to get on target. This results in the feeling that Snake is actually that legendary soldier everyone claims him to be. This, of course, extends to the obligatory tranquilizer gun which now has a much slower flying round and even pretty severe drop to compensate for how powerful it can be. No longer can you just place a laser sight on the enemy's head and knock them out, you must actively compensate for range and movement. The game also features a pretty handy little recon system where spotting an enemy through your binoculars or just giving them a good look can mark them, allowing you to view them through walls while in close proximity. While some players may offer the opinion that this makes the game too easy, the act of actually doing recon to gain these abilities makes it much more than just a cheat. Reflex Mode is another new addition to help players out, slowing time down to a crawl if they're spotted so they can attempt to silence the guard before he gives them away. Thankfully, the option to disable these and all the other sneaking aids in the game is offered.The camo system of MGS3 and 4 has been removed in favor of a more natural approach to stealth, almost in line with the older Splinter Cell games. The lower your stance, the harder you are to see. Shadows and bushes can also be used to conceal your presence. Guards in this iteration are much more capable than they were in previous MGS games as well. Their sight ranges and detection capabilities are far greater than any previous Metal Gear Solid and they generally behave a whole lot more realistically as a consequence. This can make sneaking in feel very slow paced and tense but incredibly fun to pull off. Additionally, if you just feel like going in loud, you'll probably enjoy yourself too. Guards now put up a much better fight over long range and offer a very satisfying reaction to being shot, each hit providing varied feedback beyond the typical ""hurt"" animation. (Also, the headshot sound is up there with Counter-Strike's in terms of sheer morbid pleasure.)The game isn't without it's problems too. Guard behavior can feel clueless occasionally and their ability to randomly turn their heads to look around and do different animations can actually mess up speedrun-y tactics that worked the last few retries. The Camp Omega map isn't quite big enough in my opinion and it definitely starts to feel same-y after 10 to 20 hours of attempting to 100% the game. The PC port has no mouse controlled menus but the WASD and mouse click controlled alternative isn't terrible. Mouse aim doesn't scale for zoom, meaning aiming through scopes or just the zoomed in binoculars is incredibly twitchy and hard to get on target. There's also, inexplicably, no toggle binoculars key, meaning you have to awkwardly hold down the F key the entire time you're using them. This wouldn't be too bad if you could put the binoculars function on an additional mouse button but the game doesn't support binding to Mouse 4 and 5 either.If you're a die-hard MGS fan, you've probably already played this on your console of choice but if you waited patiently for the PC release, you really should pick up this version. It's amazingly well optimized, only demanding a DX11-capable graphics card and a 64-bit OS. If you meet those requirements, you can run this. The graphics menu is deep enough to get this beast working on any toaster and those with monster rigs will get the eye-candy they seek. Admittedly, the graphics menu has a few problems like clumping depth of field, motion blur, and post-processing anti-aliasing together into one setting but these can be (mostly) forgiven based on just how nicely it runs. You might even be surprised at how high you can turn the settings up.Overall, Ground Zeroes is a promising tease of open world MGS, reaching Hitman-esque levels of techniques to beat each mission. If a game this sparse can provide that amount of depth, it's hard not to be excited for The Phantom Pain and its expanded sandbox."

Again, I don't know if it was my keyboard or a glitch.- I'd aim at a guy's back with the tranquilizer gun and it would miss him. Seriously? I aim at his back and it doesn't register?

Extensive MGS knowledge isn't mandatory, but will most likely enhance your appreciation of and understanding of the story.P.S. One mechanic I wish I would have known from the beginning: if you shoot a guard with a lethal weapon after he sees you but before he radios into HQ to alert the base of your presence, you can delay his base-wide alert, allowing you to close the distance between you and him to disarm and neutralize him non-lethally."

Now that it is on PC it has truly arrived in its most definitive form.  Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is a prime example of how PC Ports should be done.  Utilizes 4 cores on my i7 and has never dipped below 60 fps on my GTX 780 with highest settings turned on.  This definitely has primed me for the forthcoming Phantom Pain.  Sure the main mission is short and can be completed rather quickly but the extras thrown in here allow you to hone your skills and prepare for the real meal.

Even if your not as mad about Metal Gear as me and you like stealth games that allow you to go Arni if you wish, there is a lot of fun to be had here with the slickest gameplay yet seen in a stealth game and a cool 80's action movie vibe.It will take about 8 hours to complete if you take your time (trying to be stealthy) first time I played the main mission it took about 4 hours as I liked exporing the base. There is plenty of scope for emergent gameplay depending on how you react to getting into trouble.The side missions are all pretty good with each offering something different and even the change from day to night makes a difference to the gameplay by taking away your shadowed hiding spots but it also serves to make the base feel fresh after many hours in the dark.If you're the kind of player who wants to rush from point A to point B then I would wait for big price drop, if your the kind of player that likes to savour the game and explore every nook and cranny and find all the hidden (disturbing) story tapes and hidden weapons then this is for you. Oh yeah the graphics are simply beatiful, with some nice resolution options as long as your rig has the muscle. The shadows, light and textures are also petty good, the animations are fluid and the control is extemely responsive on both keyboard/mouse and controller.To those new to Metal Gear, welcome aboard. Ater a long time Metal Gear has come home to take it's place with the PC master race now if you'll excuse me I'm off to crawl around in the dirt and shadows choking 8itches out."

You can tackle the missions in any way you want to, stealth being the most difficult and rewarding. There is the main mission, which is what a typical main story mission would be like (in that there are small cutscenes within the mission, and multiple objectives) as well as what side missions in TPP would look like.The game itself runs at a solid 60fps and the graphics are very pretty.It also shows the dynamic weather effects to look forward to in TPP. The main mission is dark and rainy, one side mission is at night, another is bright ans sunny, another is at dusk, and the AI resoponds to the different weather accordingly; they can't spot or hear you as well in the rain as they can in the daytime with clear weather.The biggest complaint that I have heard about this game is that it is a short demo of a full game. My personal argument to that is that this IS a demo, and I would say that $10 to $15 dollars is actually worth this game. I have nearly 30 hours logged in as I write this review and that price is worth that ammount of money to me. The money used to buy this game goes towards TPP, it gives a great idea of what TPP would be like (on a small scale obviously) and it is a lot of fun.For the MGS fans:It is a bit different than traditional MGS games, however, once you get the feel for the game, you will feel right at home.For non MGS fans, or people curious in MGS games:This game does not bombard you with story or long cutscenes like the other MGS games. You DO NOT need to play the other games to get what the story is in this game or TPP. If you are interested in the series, I would say this is an excellent place to start, as this and TPP will be the climax to the story of Big Boss and, if nothing else, will intrest people more in Metal Gear's complicated plot.And if plot isn't your interest, then this game is just fun, so there's that.Long story short: If this game is on sale for 10-15 dollars, then give it a go."

The main story is about 2 hours long, depending on how you approach the mission, but there are also a few other ""side"" missions that are separate from the main mission, like destroying certain structures or assassinating certain characters.One of the down sides for fans of the series is that David Hayter, the original voice of Snake since the first Metal Gear Solid game, did not return for this, but Keifer Sutherland, does a great job as a replacement for the voice of Snake."

The Area is huge though and there are a lot of different missions you can do in that area.Game is mission based, not quest giver or discovery based which I like as I don't see MGS as an RPG in open world type combat. That being said there are still discovery components. Like one mission has you find 2 people and eliminate them, you have to look for them, follow their patterns and find the best way to kill them.If you only care about the story and the main mission campaign then this is not for you but it will give you an insight into what the main game will be about as this is a prequel. If you like MGS, want to show support for them bringing it to PC, want to start building the hype train to MGS V, want to see some GORGEOUS cinematics, and do some fun missions at different times of the day/weather effects for each one then this is for sure for you.The port is solid, KB/M feels fine and I cannot wait for the release."

If you know what you're doing, then you can be done with the game in about an hour. However, people judging this game based solely on the the average run time shouldn't even bother writing any reviews. Now on to my actual assessment.Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is a prologue to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, and a sequel to Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker. You play as Naked Snake/Big Boss/Snake on a mission to rescue two prisoners who are for whatver reason imprisoned in this Guantonomo Bay-esque military prison-base in Cuba(?).The gameplay and movement, even when using a keyboard and mouse, is absolutely superb. There is rarely a time where you don't feel 110% in control of Snake's movement, though when prone-crawling, moving any way that isn't forward or backward can feel a little off, though this is an issue when using a gamepad as well. The guns feel good to use, though for some this may be subjective. I do have a couple of minor annoyances, such as picking up bodies is mapped to the reload button by default. This wouldn't be a problem, if it wasn't for picking up XOF badges while holding one of these bodies causes you to throw the unlucky pile of cartilage to the ground.  Also, when using the binoculars, I personally would appreciate the ""pull up binoculars"" button to be a toggle, rather than a persistent holding of the button. Also, while you *can* zoom in using the scroll wheel, it is much too slow to be of any real use.The screenshots speak for themselves, this game is absolutely gorgeous. The Fox engine is a marvel, and this being the first proper game to showcase it's capabilities fills me with a lot of hope for the coming titles that will use it.The game is extremely well optimized, my rig is an AMD FX-6300, GTX 760, with 8 gb of ram. With Model and Texture quality kicked up to very high, and everything else on high, I get a rock solid 60fps. I do dislike how anti aliasing, depth of field, and I belive some sort of motion blur are all rolled under one category of ""screen filtering,' but it's not a dealbreaker by any means. No mouse control in menus, again, minor annoyance, but definitely not enough to put more than a tiny, tiny smudge on this games overall assessment.I don't personally believe in the ""x/10"" system, but if you want a TL;DR version, here ya go:TL;DR: This game is amazing. Buy this game to support an amazing quality port, and to encourage Japanese developers to give us quality PC ports, that aren't just dating sims."

This ingame language selection only affects text, so don't choose Japanese unless you can read it, or changing the language will be a pain. If you can choose any other language, you are playing the international version with English voice acting.Now to the actual game.This is what games should be like: Solid performance (no pun intended) and hardly any noticeable bugs or issues without the need to install 3 day-one patches (looking at you, Ubisoft).The main mission is unfortunately way too short and can be finished in half an hour if you know what to do and where to go, or less than 3 hours if you take your time.If you're aiming for completion, however, you could easily be playing this game for over 20 hours, like I did on the PS4.Gameplay-wiseGround Zeroesmight be a bit underwhelming for MGS veterans. The shift from Stealth to Action is very noticeable.It is no longer possible to knock on walls to attract guards; we do get an infinite amount of empty magazines to throw around, however.There is only one crawling speed; no more super-slow crawling. At least we can still roll around...Playing dead is also no longer possible, and there are no containers to hide in (no lockers or trash bins or similar).There's no camo; It's always weird to see a guard standing in front of a door, not noticing an old man dressed in a dark-blue skinsuit lying around in front of him while he's pointing a flashlight at said old man.And there's no cardboard box. Yes, I wasn't kidding when I said there were no containers to hide in.Despite all, this game is still pretty good and deserving recommendation.I spent a lot of time exploring all kinds of ways to get into Camp Omega, I spent a lot of time exploring all kinds of ways to get out again, and I'm going to do it all over again.

This game is a stealth game that rewards you for not being seen but gives you the tools and great game engine to load a mag, remove the suppressor, and fight your way in and out.Pros-This game is amazing but only a hour and half long. Once you beat it once you unlock side ops that take place on the same map, with different objectives, troop strength and positions, and every time you play through you unlock new equipment. This is probably to show you the different ways to come at the facility and I have done everything from Guns Blazing to nobody saw me. For example I have snuck in undetected with out being seen or touching a single Marine, saved the hostage, shot may way out of the tunnel, stole a jeep by killing the driver, called for extract, drove to the LZ as the chopper was showing up, and laid suppressive fire till he got low enough to board. These endless on the fly options make even my 10th play through feel drastically different.The control options are amazing. Leaning out from cover to fire, grabbing people up and interrogating them, or choking them out, or cutting their throat, or using them as a shield to fire over their shoulder. All of it a fluid and ridiculously easy to do. While easier to perform actions than MGS4 was there are some moves I miss like rolling on my back and firing up, leaning out to look instead of just to fire, and being able to use the weapon selector switch to swap between single, burst, and full auto.The game is ridiculously well optimize even on the highest setting.Cons-Play this with an official X-Box Remote! The game is picky on what remote you are using and while it does support Keyboard and mouse it is a console port with K+M is an absolute struggle to use. You have to be able to press in the direction of the wall to lean on it, issue is as you spin the camera to look around forward becomes left then back then right then forward again. The problem stems from the fact analog stick was 45 degree angles, keyboards do not. So when you are spinning the camera you tend to jump from cover.Price,$60 is outrageous for this game with such little content, even $20 is kinda steep. I got it on sale for $7 and this game is well worth $7. Put it on your wish list and grab it on sale.TL;DRProsRidiculous amount of in game options, from on the fly interacting with the environment, to tools and abilities to use stealth, to being able to easily swap between COD style FPS and Gears of War 3rd person to just Rambo your way in and out.Great OptimizationConsHour and a Half campaign plus replayability with new objectives and unlocks (All progress transfers to MGS V Phantom Pain)Being a console port Mouse and Keyboard is crude, remote works flawlessly (Use a wired X-Box Remote to circumvent compatibility issues)Price was ridiculous at $60, $20 is far better, when it's on sale its $7 and that's unbeatable...."

Why would I buy this?Well like I said, this game is the appetizer for Hideo Kojima's METAL GEAR SOLID V:PHANTOM PAIN; which releases on September 1st. So I don't advise buying this game for the story, but..purchase this as a teaser. A playable trailer almost. You get to experiance the gameplay aspects you will get in Phantom Pain, and since we're on the subject; it plays pretty damn good!This little game has a lot of replayability, as well gameplay. Voice acting? Beautiful. Sound design? Stunning. PC port controls? Fantastic.In my opinion, I feel you should give this game a try before buying Phantom Pain, it'll only set you back 20$.Also, if you buy Phantom Pain right now you get a copy of Ground Zeroes free, also you get to play as ""Big Boss/Snake"". Also you can play music. Drive cars. Shoot people. Extort information out of your enemies. Choke out little boys, and so much more!"

From the main mission to the side ops, there's no way you can do everything in 2 hours. From getting S rank on Easy and Hard , to completing trials, finding tapes and xof patches (unlocks more missions). More than one play is required to see and do everything.Even the amount of story and background information leading up to TPP threw me off guard. I wasn't ready lol. Its definitely worth finding all the cassette tapes.

,Recommended,311340,17681667,"Posted: 23 August, 2015",all,The Homosecsualist,"GAMEPLAY REVIEW ONLY: The control scheme and player interactivity seems quite reminiscent of the refined version of MGS3 to me (haven't played 4), and i think that's a great thing! I use k+m to play the game and the controls feel very responsive. You have an arsenal of options at your disposal and the game never feels clunky when executing them. When you shoot you have a more significant recoil than in past Metal Gear Solid games and i find that to be a nice addition that adds difficulty and realism to the game; two things which i can imagine being significant in the upcoming ""Metal Gear Online.""Two big things that arguably counter this finely tuned control system though are the enemy A.I. system and the new slow motion game mechanic. Even in Hard Mode, i found that the enemy's poor and unrealistic field of view was cotninously taking me out from the immersion. You might be standing in their ""realistic"" field of vision but they still won't recognize your activity because ""you're just a tiny bit too far away"", and their patrolling and reconnaissance seems too simple to me personally. The game's iteration of the tranqualizer again (in classic Metal Gear fashion) makes things a bit too easy, and i found myself playing my own version of the game where i would do my best not to come into contact with the enemy whatsoever. If you think about it, the game's enemy A.I. and context is not as difficult and realistic as it could be, it's been like this since the beginning of time and for the most part it's ok....because these games are much bigger than the sum of their parts. The games shouldn't be sadistically hard, but there's undeniable potential for a more cerebral stealth...but that's a discussion for another time...The slow motion mechanic i previously mentioned seems unneccessary. If you're spotted, the game basically gives you a second chance (a couple seconds as the game world selflessly stops just for you...) in which you can try to take them out before they start the alarm off. You can turn it off though, no harm no foul.The game world itself is rich and detailed and allows for different strategies and ways to tackle the objectives (as already shown in the official E3 game teasers for TPP. There's a plethora of side missions and fun unlockables that will easily give you plenty of game time with this title.This is game plays very well, but i personally think it can still reach a higher bar, which im sure it will in one way or the other in TPP."

I'm a huge MGS fan so this is extremely biased but the only reason people can dislike this game is because of it's length. When phantom pain comes out in 8 days the only negative thing about this game will have potentially been fixed on top of all the minor improvements to gameplay mechanics and the mountains of new features and new gameplay mechanics implemented.It's a great port, it's a great mini game with extremely responsive controls.

I decided to get more hyped for MGSV by preordering and aquiring Ground Zero for free and playing until the release.Keep in mind this was released 1 year ago and it was a teaser of how the full game would be like, which was a big disappointment to a lot of Metal Gear fans due to the fact it felt like a demo with a high price tag ($39.99 iirc). I played it on console but decided to buy MGSV on PC.Pros- Story; Hideo Kojima has always been known for good story telling, basically all his games are a well written movie. The cinematics in Ground Zero really set the stage for a good foreshadow of what is soon to come.- Control fluidity; back in the past games, the inventory system was used by the triggers on the controllers which paused the game, now you can use the D-PAD to go through items and weapons without having to pause the game.- Graphics; The game runs smooth at a solid 60fps which should be required for the next gen games, the visuals itself are amazing and I have yet to see anything ugly.- Open World/Sandbox; The missions give you complete freedom of how you execute them which I love, adds replay value.- The AI; they are more intelligent this time around, they aren't tunnel visioned and actually do tactical flanks when alerted to your position.Cons- There are some object clipping but again this was released in 2014 and I'm sure that the devs will fix this for the full game.To sum this review up, I would recommend this game if you have not yet played it, and/or are preordering for MGS V: Phantom Pain.10/10"

I just am sooo amazed at HOW much this game has changed (for the better) with the playstyle and game mechanics. The creators at Kojima Productions REALLY outdid their selves and thsi is only a VERY small taste of what's to come in The Phantom Pain. Although the story is very short, I think that the replay value is VERY high for this. Going back ot try to get better ranks, Shave time of your fastest run, find all the little ""secrets"" (if you wanna call them that), and finding things you didnt find the last time you played. This is an AWESOME introductory to not only the gameplay mechanics but the story for what is driving Big Boss in The Phantom Pain. This picks up I belive aproximately 1 year after the events of Peace Walker and it does an awesome job of picking up RIGHT where that left off. I can just keep saying all the good things about this game. It looks just as beautiful as it plays. the controlls are VERY SMOOTH (Minus the Sniper Rifle when it's zoomed teh whole way in, but that's able to be worked around). I am a VERY long time Metal Gear fan and it's literaly my favorite game SERIES of all time and if this is any inclination of what The Phantom Pain is to bring us... I am VERY hopefull for it (And TPP has also recieved 6 different scores of 10/10 at the time of writing this, which is less than 24 hours to TPP launch). One thing that I have done in preperation before playing this was to go back and play the games that come before this STORY wise. The games release order was NOT, I repeat was NOT, the correct storry order (see below) Anyone new to the series could VERY easily jump into the game and kinda pick up on what's going on. But if you TRULY want to know EVERYTHING, each and every last little detail, I VERY VERY much suggest you play though (Or even watch the multitude of either Lets Play's and Game Movies that are availible online to catch up on the story so far).I would just suggest someone COMPLETELY new  to teh series play them in CHRONOLOGICAL order instead of release order. Only because some poeple coudl be confused by who Big Boss is and who SOLID Snake is. When I was younger and played the first couple Metal Gear Solid Games back in 1998 and I think it was 2002 for MGS2: Sons of Liberty, I was still kinda confused about some things they talked about that happened in Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake (Older games from the MSX from the late 80's). Playing the games in chronological order to the STORY makes more sense to me That way some poeple may not know if they are talking about Big Boss or Solid Snake. If that's the case and you ARE new. I'd play them in the following order, just as I played the first couple getting ready for this game and The Phantom Pain (which at the time of writing this comes out in less than 24 hours)Metal Gear Solid: 3: Snake EaterMetal Gear Sold: Peace WalkerMetal Gear Sold 5: Ground ZeroesMetal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom PainMetal Gear (VERY first game to be released in the series BEFORE the PSX gameMetal Gear 2: Solid SnakeMetal Gear Solid (First game on the PSX from 1998)Metal Gear Sold 2: Sons of LibertyMetal Gear Sold 4: Guns of the Patriotsand if you want to count it (I don't)Metal Gear Rising at the end (follows Raiden after the events of MGS4 and not central to the story, i thought that game was GARBAGE but that was my opintion)My final verdict for Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes:9/10Pros:- Amazing Game Engine- Smooth controls- Easy to learn, hard to master- Engaging story for an introductory game- All new game mechanicsCons:- AI is a little slow at times and gives up too easy- Sniper Rifle zoomed in is WAY too touchy- Vehicles can be a bit difficult to drive at times- Stealth sneaking with keyboard is difficult (Gamepad recommended for sneaking due to sticks that are pressure senstive for moving slowly."

I played the main story and if you are not a hardcore stealth fan it really does not matter what you do. The question is not really the length but whether or not I enjoyed the game. And the truth is yes I did. Maybe it is because I recently finished Metal Gears Solid 4 on the Playstation 3 and my biggest complaint is that I did not really play enough. It felt like one major movie and the gameplay was just an intermission so I could get popcorn and a drink. But that's Metal Gear Solid 4.Ground Zeroes is fun to play but just when you think you finished the training mission you actually finished the game. That said there were many option I did not explore with the game so I will probably could go back to it and try again which gives it some replayability but not much. If this was a $5 - $10 game there would be no problem but the justify the $20 price tag on steam is a bit difficult.I do recommend the game because it is fun and you will get some enjoyment out of it but you will feel a bit cheated paying full price for it so to avoid feeling like that do not pay more than $10 for this game.

I didn't think Konami could ever do a proper PC game, but Ground Zeroes, while still flawed, disproves that thought.The MGS gameplay has changed a lot over the years. MGS2 had fixed camera angles and super weird controls. I have the HD edition on X360 and haven't played more than a few min because the controls were so confusing. MGS3 gave a proper camera but the controls were still mind-boggling - you still can't move and fire at the same time, and firing a gun is super awkward as it requires holding down a face button, aiming, then releasing, rather than using the controller's triggers. MGS4 and Peace Walker transformed the controls to be more like Splinter Cell, which was a much-welcomed move that carries over to MGS5. I don't think I'll ever beat MGS2 or MGS3 because I can't get over those controls.Unfortunately, the lack of mouse support in the menus shows serious console-itis. Navigating the iDroid, or just changing my game settings, is a serious chore without a mouse. I also can't rebind actions to my mouse thumb buttons - unacceptable in 2015! I ended up plugging in a controller because the game was clearly designed for one.At least the optimization is surprisingly good. I've got all the details cranked up at 1080p on a GTX760 and there's no sign of any slowdown. The game looks and feels great, and I'm now looking forward to Phantom pain (after a steam sale that is).The gameplay is Assassin's Creed meets Splinter Cell, in a good way. There are so many ways to finish an objective, and so many options for dealing with enemies. The introduction of vehicles is also pretty awesome.I won't complain about the fact that there's only one level in this game - Hideo Kojima was honest about it before release. He made it clear that this was only a preview game, like what happened with Gran Turismo 5 on the PS3. However, charging $20 full price is too much for too little. It's not worth more than the $5 I paid for it.As for the story... well, that's only in the phantom pain."

It just gives you that feel that you have accomplished something.Yeah you can go ahead and whine that the map is small and stuff, but to me it feels big, all the missions are played on the same map but the patrols are different, you have to go to different places on the map, it has nice variety in my opinion and is definitely worth the price i paid when it was on sale."

Nice prologue to upcoming Phantom Pain.I am not MG/MGS fan and this game is my ""first"" in MG/MGS series.Pretty well managed game which can be easily ruler of stealth genre. If you do love stealth like me you must definitely taste MGSV:GZ. No matter if you are new to MGS world like me. Game is still more than enjoyable no matter that there is ""only one"" level/location with 6 missions in it.Anyway bought it on Steam sale fo 10€, which is exactly the price which i am fine with for such game.Pros:tech:- nice level design, everything feel logic and real- not bad AI- graphics is well balanced and done with superior perfection (except long term sort of antipathy of Kojima Productions devs to having all round things simply round, i mean more polygons for having at least rounded silhouetes on object which deserve it)- despite to mid-poly overall design game looks gorgeous with Fox engine's Physicall Based Rendering and looks even beautiful and more detailed in 4K- beautiful lighting- perfect sound design- encountered no bugs or glitchesgame:- not so large, but very believable map (U.S. mil-base on Cuba)- nice atmosphere and overall setting- countless approaches to finish each mission- possibility to turn off any ""augmentation"" on your HUD and make game feel more real (also much more harder :))- high replayability - i didn't trust this one and also i was thinking ""but i don't want game which has one map and going there again and again"" - well, i must admit how wrong i was, game is more and more fun with every replayCons:- you will get an explanation for basic moves of Snake, but rest of special movements, CQC etc. you need to figure yourself (or search it on the web, anyway someone remembers i.e. nice training camp in Splinter Cell 1 where one could get used with every Sam's move?)- more and more i am into game (i.e. after 10-12 hours of playing) i see some small objects and NPCs pop-ins- really unballanced AI - explanation is bellowOn the one hand overall (or global) feeling of AI is nice:- they can see you and they can hear you. Blowing something up (throwing an grenade, shooting an barrell, using C4 etc.) draws their attention, same with unsilenced gunshots. And they will go investigate, even if there is last soldier standing in opposite corner of base- if some NPC thinks he sees something suspicious there is possibility he will go investigate, but guards on towers will call for someone else go to investigate meanwhile they cover any area from aboveBut in on the other hand - at local scale they can be reall dumb and limited:- AI can't climb small buildings or/and structures, can't climb/jump over obstacles, same with crawling under obstacles, they not even able to check places where you can hide crawling (under some structures and buildings). I think when AI sees you on roof of some small building and he reports via radio he is going to check it it is just stupid to see him going around you away saying ""nothing found"" instead of he simply could get up to roof same as id did with Snake.- another example - you have possibility to turn off electricity for certain area in game. CP sends guard or two to investigate main distribution/fuses rack in area. They will find it. You will knock them or kill them. CP will send one more to investigate. Get rid of him/them and you are fine, no more checking why are all cameras and all lights out, no matter there are tens of another guards in base- final example - you can plant C4 around whole base, but no NPC will notice/report/try to disarm them, not even if they are standing in front of it and looking on it, no matter there is BIG RED light flashing with loud BEEP, BEEP ;)ConclusionEven MGSV:GZ can sometimes look unballanced when it comes to sort of ""game realism"" (i.e. you have realistic gun silencer which worns out, fine, on the other way you have sometimes stupidly acting AI), but still is a must play for every stealth fan. If you don't like hiding ""for ever"" waiting for right moment, observing your surroundings and carefuly planning your mission approach - go play some other game. This game is not about being sort of John Rambo running through all mission in total havoc and complaining ""hey, i finished game in one hour"". Yes, you can do it, but it is nonsense as game offers tons of ways to have fun with stealth.I played series/games like Thief (old series and new one), Splinter Cell, Far Cry and Assassins Creed, Dishonored etc. and loved them all, every game has its own stealth mechanics or possibilities. But what you can do and see in such let's say ""stealth sandbox"" like MGSV:GZ is - this is just fantastic. And if you do hear people complaining about short play time don't listen them. Game is presented like ""teaser"" and showing off new MGS series possibilities to be fully shown in upcoming Phantom Pain. And i take it as it is beautiful presentation with ballanced fun and level of realism. And everything in game feels and works perfect.Conclusion v2:Can't wait for Phantom Pain.

Also, I have to admit it is a damn good demo in showcasing the mechanical depth and fantastic level design that is come to be expected from MGS games. It does incorporate a save transfer feature where a few things you do in this game will carry over to TPP, like the mass effect series does. It's a shame it doesn't show off more of the gadgets and mechanics we will be using in the TPP, though what is there is great enough. Oh and the pc port is actually really good. It is optimized well and runs a stable framerate (at 60 on my near high-end rig). The only annoyances I have is that the main menus don't have mouse support.That said I wouldn't really recommend this game to anyone who isn't already a fan of MGS. Like if you have never played a MGS game then this game probably won't do it for you because it is basically just a mission sandbox on the same map.

Every aspect of the game was perfectly designed to be balanced and entertaining. Plus this game is absolutely gorgeous.If you've heard this game is short it is by no means too little. You can play this missions over and over again trying to improve your rank, and each time it will be a new experience due to the dynamic and free flowing nature of the game. Its one of those games that just feels good when you play it, everything in the game progresses in a fair and exiciting way.

,Recommended,311340,13652552,"Posted: 27 December, 2014",all,Devin May Cry,"Before I say anything about the gameplay, let me first address the controversial topic of the game's length.If you speedrun the game, you can complete every mission in about 2-3 hours. HOWEVER, if you are a completionist or enjoy the replay value that the map and missions have to offer, you can easily get about a dollar-per-hour of value out of the game. I didn't even S-rank everything and I got 17 hours out of the game for only ~42% completion. Be creative and don't expect to be spoon-fed your fun.Now, for the gameplay. This is an exciting taste of what's to come for The Phantom Pain. There's a lot of loving detail included in the little things. The movement animations for Snake are amazing - 99% of his animations are believable save for a few cases where you can intentionally make him look stupid. The AI is decent, but predictable - however, it's hard to make AI that doesn't at some point become predictable. Having played on both a PS3 controller and a mouse + keyboard, I prefer the controller but the PC controls are ALMOST as comfortable save for a few hitches (which can be helped with some key rebindings.) Above all, the stealth action is challenging but satisfying, rewarding careful planning, quick execution, and ability to improvise.The graphics are amazing and the game is optimized well. The story is admittedly edgy and kind of grimdark for a MGS game, but the series' brand of quirky humor still shines through in some missions.Overall, I highly recommend if you like stealth games and like to go for extras/collectibles/high scores. If you don't, it's still worth it in my opinion, but you may want to wait for it to go on sale."

It's now an open world where every time you play is different. Do whatever you want, take on the mission any way you want. Unlike with other games where they changed things and totally lost the feel of what made the game good, the changes Kojima Productions did only made Metal Gear Solid better. They did'nt loose that Metal Gear Solid feel. You still use alot of the crawling and sneaking. Another thing I like is the HUD it has the bare minimum. No on screen map showing you where the enemy is. The only way to keep track of your enemy is to tag them with your binoculars. This makes the game feel real and full of suspense.This is just a prologue! You only get one map with this game. When I found this out I was kind of dissapointed at first. After I completed the first mission which was awsome. It unlocked other missions within the same map.

Coming into this game and seeing all the changes threw me off. but i quickly learned that it was the same basic design only improved. no more sloppy aiming, no more vague CQC (close quarters combat), and very easy to learn stealth mechanics.there are a few things that have been added that drasticly change the way mgs is played. the marking system, and the spotted system.once spotted the game goes into slow motion, and shows the enemy that saw you. i both like and hate this, it creates a weird disconnect between normal exploration and sneaking into a slow motion quicktime. im not saying thats bad but in my opinion it makes it very different and jarring at first but extremely useful.At the beggining of the game you are introduced to your binoculars which can help you scope out the area but it can also mark enemies. the marking of enemies has been in many games such as deus ex, farcry 3, splinter cell, and hitman.its such an old and used concept that its strange to see it in a metal gear game especially when its never helped you keep track of enemies. like i said before i like and hate this, it makes it feel less like metal gear and more like splintercell.on the otherhand this helps greatly since the areas are massive and expansive, no longer is it small areas with a set number of enemies not its a huge field of things to keep track of.so play with them on, or off your choiceas a game and as a metal gear game i strongly recommend this game to the old and newbs to the series."

The main mission, Ground Zeroes, can be done in about 8-10 minutes if you already know what to do and skip all the cutscenes.  That's the end of the ""main"" game.  After that, the Side and Extra Ops are unlocked, along with extra weapons and challenges to complete, depending on how well you did.The extra missions take place on the same island/map, only with different guard patrols, tanks and weather conditions such as a sunny day or just a normal night.  I found that only two missions really caught my interest, the INTEL OPERATIVE RESCUE, which continues from recruiting a certain person from Peace Walker, and Déjà Vu, which I also don't want to spoil too much.You can play any mission however you want, Loud to Stealth, Stealth to Loud, Stealth, Loud, No Kill, Kill everything, extract everyone, etc,  Though No Kill Stealth is emphasised, like the other MGS games.It runs ""fine"" on my old, toaster laptop at an average 40 fps with lowest settings and resolution, save for textures, texture filtering (which can't go lower than Medium) and Models being one Medium and Extra High, respectively.If it's on sale for 75% off, it's definitely fun and worth it.  less than that, well, it's your money."

Snake being Snake is sent to rescue them and has the finest gear to help him get around the Cuban Base. I really like the dynamic ways you can get around the area and make choices regarding to the situation you are in whether its sneaking past, putting someone to sleep or quickly responding to getting spotted by popping a cap in someones head. The one thing I like about MGS is the CQC and Snake does the perfect job in this game to wriggle out information from enemies before either killing or knocking them out. But everyone knows its best just to knock them out for the cheeky bonus. You have many ways to get around the base and try and complete the objectives and people to ♥♥♥♥♥ about this game being like only 2 hours long but that is story wise. Once you do that you unlock side ops and can go through the level maybe using a different tactic but people think otherwise.

This package stands on its own feet as the vanguard of MGS's rebirth on PC with the upcoming MGS V. I would define it as a limited open-world sandbox, a small slice of what to expect, as well as a prequel/setup of sorts for those of us MGS fans who have been waiting with bated breath for the next outing in the series. Of course, this made perfect business sense from Konami's perspective. I did not pay full price for this, getting it at the introductory sales time with approximately 40% off. I don't know if I would have gone for it at full whack.So what do we get here? We get a solid impression of the new gameplay possibilities that will feature in MGS 5, superb enemy AI, solid backstory, and the tried-and-tested stealth 'em up mechanics we all know and love. What else? You get an intricately woven web of possibilities with a LOT of replay value and challenges for you to consider to retry and rediscover based on your play style and approach. There certainly *is* variety on offer here.Interesting to note that as the MGS series delves into its past, it proceeds to the most advanced ever technological and visual outing the series has seen so far. It is a paradox worthy of Kojima himself. The game looks gorgeous, with a multitude of graphics settings and customisation options. Audio is excellent. Gameplay-wise, the setting is immersive, challenging you to adapt as only the original stealth 'em up can. Of course, being an MGS fan is kind of a pre-requisite to getting your full play time's worth. The basic run took me about 4 hours, and I can see myself getting at least that much once again by completing side-ops and just dicking around in general. The only complaint I have as a spoilt PC gamer is that the checkpoint system means no saving on the fly."

For $20, some may argue that the game isn't worth the time, and it definitely is a short game per se, with only 1 main mission coupled with a number of side missions, all set in the same map.Where the game experience mostly comes from is how you decide to approach each mission, whether you want to go for a classic stealth run, or want to go loud and CQC some enemies to the ground. The open nature of the game allows you to approach the mission in any way you want, infiltrating the base by climbing onto a passing truck, cutting off power to the base to hide your approach and escape, or just knocking everyone you see out with your tranq gun. The AI is programmed to feel more responsive and intelligent than previous metal gear games, adding depth to the game as they respond to knocked out cameras, keep in radio contact with one another and coordinate attacks against you if you're caught.Overall Ground Zeroes is not for everyone, but if you want to experience the new mechanics that will be out for the upcoming Phantom Pain game, and want to test your mettle against Kojima's new Fox Engine and attention to detail, Ground Zeroes might just be for you."

If that's the case, this game provides an exclusive smaller open world along with several big missions not found in The Phantom Pain. If you're interested in the story, you should buy this along with MGS1-4 and Peace Walker (all can be found on PS3), and play them in release order. Anyway, the game plays really well, looks amazing, has an unmatched atmosphere and superb cinematography and voice acting.For Metal Gear fans:While it's definitely the smallest game in the series, fans of the series will see that Ground Zeroes is an essential piece in the story and stands on its own both plot- and gameplay-wise. It directly continues the story of Peace Walker and leads up to The Phantom Pain. The side missions are fun and varied and contain tons of fan service. And as mentioned above, the gameplay is superb (only surpassed by The Phantom Pain, which makes some improvements) and the graphics are possibly the best in the series.Overall, I'd only recommend this to fans of Metal Gear and/or people who want the complete MGSV experience."

It typically happens when you're high up and you can see the whole base, especially in the Ground Zeroes mission because of the the rain. This makes me really worried about the dynamic weather system in The Phantom Pain--will it slay the fps every time a storm hits?Other than that, it's a stellar port :)Edit: Updated my GPU from a GTX750ti, to a GTX970. It runs fine at a solid (if you'll excuse the pun) 60fps even in the rain weather.

It is short, true. My first time beating the main mission took about one and a quarter hours, I can now do it in substancially less than that. However the gameplay is superb, there are a half-dozen side missions which are really quite varied, and the small base is dense. There are tons of conversations to overhear, equipment to pick up and a massive amount of tactical decison making to be done. Its not like many stealth games, including previous metal gears, where you have a couple paths and you choose one, there are a large number of options, and you really feel like you are following your own path. The AI is spectacular, if you are spotted a seach party is sent out and they fan the area. If a body is found they send reinforcements and if you destory a camera someone investigates. They also don't just pace in circles like robots, which goes a long way to raising the tension in the game.Graphically it is easily the best looking game I have seen to date. I don't play a huge assortment of AAA games so maybe there is something else out there, but this game is pretty. Plus, unlike so many recent console ports, it comes with real graphics options. The Keyboard/Mouse controls feel a little rough sometimes, (the game was definitely designed with analogue movement in mind) but are completely re-bindable.My only complaint is that it does feel a little short for $20 (Honestly just a little), but the length that is there is fantastic and unique and if you are a completionist there is a lot of time to be sunk into the game. I wholeheartedly recommend Ground Zeros and I am excited to see Metal Gear making its presence known on PC"

I bought this game in folly without doing any research thinking there was no way a MGS title could disappoint and that I had gotten quite a deal with the price.Wrong. The main story of this game offers 2 hours, maybe 2 and a half, of gameplay. That's assuming that like myself you play reserved and stealthy at all times. The game offers several ""side-missions"" which will all be played on the same limited map as the initial mission, the only difference being different objectives that are nearly as limited as the battleground.This was, in my eyes, a blatant cash grab. If you enjoy short games with minimal main game content that will leave you feeling forced to play side missions in order to feel as if you haven't just been robbed, then this game is for you.To be fair, this game was half of a ""complete"" title. Buying two games to feel as if I've played ONE is not my forte. Not that it would matter as this is the last MGS title I will purchase."

It's story takes place after the events of Metal Gear Solid 3, Metal Gear Solid Portable ops and Metal Gear solid Peace walker.  This game is the first in the series to make use of the Fox engine, a completely new game engine aimed at creating a new generation of games. Gameplay wise this definitely shows, movement feels more controlled and enemies seem to move around more realistically. This does seem to make the game a lot harder then previous Metal Gear games (especially with reflex mode turned off) which is something people interested in this game should take into account.Now to cover the inevitable elephant in the room when talking about this game: It's pretty short. The game has around 6 missions all taking place in the same area. However only one of those missions really matters to the story and depending on your skill can be finished in about half an hour, with the rest being more like bonus missions with true Kojimaesque eastereggs. Some argue that this makes the game a paid demo. Now I wouldn't go as far as to claim that myself, but story wise the game definitely leaves it's players hungry for more.Speaking of which, another major controversy surrounding this game would be it's macabre ending. Now I won't spoil it for anyone reading this review since they likely haven't played the game yet, but needless to say this game isn't for the faint of heart. Which isn't necessarily bad however. As it elavates the games plot to a more mature level not seen before in videogames.So would I recommend Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes? Yes, but if players feel they might be getting too little bang for their buck I would recommend them to get this game on sale."

Wait for the full releaseOTHER THAN THAT... the game is awesome. It really is. The mechanics, graphics, animation and level design are the best of all the series, and maybe even of it's entire genre.The mechanics and play style changed a lot, you've got a lot more fluidity and freedom of movement, and the graphics really show this is a next gen title, even though the game is currently capped at 60fps and uses subpar texture resolution for PC standards.

The strange part about this is it picks up after the secret unlockable ending from Peace Walker. However this one plot hole doesn't detract from the entire experience. The game is fluid, fast paced, and runs really smoothly. You don't have to have unlock the secret ending from Peace Walker to enjoy this game's story. The game's cutscenes and loading screens do a great job of explaining of what is going on.When you first play this game you start off with the first mission Ground Zeroes. This is the prologue mission to Kojima's upcoming game Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. Ground Zeroes is best described as a taste of what is to come from the Phantom Pain. After you complete the Ground Zeroes main mission you will unlock five other missions which tell the story leading up to the main Ground Zeroes mission. These extra missions all take place on the same map as the main Ground Zeroes mission. You will be very familiar with the base after playing each one of these missions, however each mission is varied and interesting enough to keep you playing.Also this game has a deep ranking system and it is fun to challenge yourself to get rank S on each misison, as well as completing the various challenges such as marking all the enemies or completing a mission without using a weapon. Challenges like this keep the replay value high.This game is a perfect buy on sale otherwise I feel like there isn't enough content to justify the purchase. It is a love letter to Metal Gear Solid fans. This game does take place at a later place in the time line so it isn't the best place to jump in if you are new to the series and are attempting to get into the lore.

Nostalgia alone brought me to Ground Zeros but the game itself kept me.  This is the very best of the original and best ""Tactical Espionage Action"" with improved graphics, improved AI and a damn hard mission objective. Sure it's short but for the sale price of 16 euro this was a steal. It also has massive replayability.  To this day I still replay MGS3: Snake Eater and the Tanker Mission in MGS2 to set myself challenges. Ground Zeros is better than both of them and because it's on PC it is better still. Playing with a Xbox 360 controller or with keyboard and mouse the controls are great. The only exception to this is the vehicle controls which I found hard with the keyboard but good with the controller.On that point, I'm playing on a Dell Laptop (Windows 8.1 64 bit, 6gb RAM, i5 2.6 Ghz dual core processor, with Nvidia 650M 2gb GPU) which is listed at the lower end of capability by Steam. The game runs flawlessly with incredible graphics. If you have a higher power PC capable of the full 4K graphics your mind will be blown.All that said if you're new to the Metal Gear series and have no experience with stealth action a games I’d only suggest buying this if you are absolutely sure that you will buy Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. Ground Zeros is a good place to learn the basics and master the very difficult mechanics of avoiding contact and neutralizing threats without being seen.

However, the controls in this game SUCKS. But by controls, I don't mean the actual gameplay (IT'S GREAT), the port just doesn't support 5+ button mouses and X1 controllers. The camera keeps zooming upwards with the X1 controller and I can't seem to find a fix for that. The 360 controller seems to run just fine, but the button prompts seems to be in Japanese (using B instead of A and X means going back). It's pretty confusing I just gave up after about half an hour.Overall, if you're a M&K guy who doesn't use 5+ button mouses, you should be fine because you can rebind your keys and the game runs brilliantly.

It's a short game with only a handful of missions, but if you're a perfectionist, you're gonna spend more than a few hours playing it.So, what can I say about Ground Zeroes? First and foremost, I'm really impressed with the production quality. The visuals are well detailed and beautiful, the VA is top notch (huge fan of Kiefer Sutherland), gameplay is excellent, animations are really well done and don't feel choppy like the ones in Splinter Cell: Blacklist. Level design is really good and allow multiple ways of completing mission objectives.The enemy AI is quite good and the enemies don't feel like dumb robots that can't see you moving right in front of their eyes. They will perform searches and communicate with each other to some degree, like when the spotlight guy detects you and ask nearby soldiers to investigate. When you get spotted and they raise the alert level, you'll see lots of enemies converging to your last known position and start looking for you, and that's something I like to see in this kind of game.On a technical level, this is a really good port. It runs silky smooth at 60fps with all the bells and whistles on my average rig - i5 3570k, 16GB RAM, GTX 760. The mouse/keyboard controls are surprisingly good and the default mapping is efficient and comfortable. It's not perfect tho: you can't use the mouse pointer to navigate menus, you must use your keyboard.Overall, it's worth every penny I paid for it, and I can't wait for The Phantom Pain!Pros:- fantastic port- very well optimized- very good keyboard/mouse controls- it's a major MGS game on PC!!Cons:- lack of mouse input to navigate menus"

The game engine must be running on witchcraft, because even on high settings this game runs as smooth as silk. As for the gameplay, it's quite interesting so far. The last MGS game I played was MGS2, so understandably this is completely different to what i'm used to, but it actually does a good job of introducing you to the open world gameplay before letting you go off on your own.Oh, and yeah, I miss David Hayter as Snake, but fortunately Keifer Sutherland does a good enough job. Admittedly I was quite worried that, being a screen actor, he would end up phoning it in (like most other screen actors do when attempting voiceover work). But no, he commits to the part and does a good job, so thank god for that.To end this review, so far I would highly recommend getting this, if only in the hopes that it would convince Konami to release more MGS games on the PC (or at the least re-release the PC ports of MGS1 and MGS2)."

I have been waiting so long for more metal gear on the PC and I gotta say that if Phantom Pain is gonna look and play like this then it will surley obtain a game of the year status. This game is really good I mean really really good and it is one of the best PC ports of a game that I have ever played. The only drawback of this game is it's shortness but even after finishing the main mission in 2 hours I still found the side ops to be really fun and because of that I was determined to come back for more. Even though all side ops take place on the same map as the main mission I never got bored. If you are determined to play everything at least once it will take you 10 hours or so but even longer if you are a completionist. In my opinion this game is totally worth it if you are playing more than the main mission but if not then you should wait for it to get dirt cheap. All things aside this game is geat and plays like a damn fiddle

The PC version is by far the most spectacular, it shows off the Fox Engine at its finest if you have the hardware to back it up (move over 1080, here comes 4k), sorry console purist the master race wins this time.If you've played any of the Metal Gear Solid series, then you already know what type of cinematic journey you're in for and it is well worth it albeit shorter than usual.The new voice casting is not a big deal as I had originally thought it would be. Lets leave it at that, we know the details already.

The game performs nicely even with my friends hd 7870 he is getting on all high settings except for the dof option which is off at a good 40-55fps.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=358192946How does it Play?It plays pretty well, while playing with keyboard and Mouse I do have some problems running into walls which would be much easier to avoid with a analog that does full rotational 360 turns. So I would suggest to use a controller to play this game as it feels it is more playable with a controller.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=358246593How is the Story?The story by far is pretty well, as a fan of mgs series and even to the point of buying a Ps3, psp and ps vita to play metal gear solid, I have enjoyed it right now. Im a stealth type a guy. I love the connections to the Peace Walker serieshttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=358283342How's the sound?The sound is pretty epic, everything has a sound, rain drops, wind sound, foot steps and crawling. The gun sounds are pretty good but could put more realism a bit.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=358193035Finally Finishing the first mission from  the base I have felt the freedom of the game, Just like Peacewalker the games controls felt a lot better and the stealth is pretty awesome too. I would recommend this demo at a 15 and under price, and will also recommend the MGS V Phantom Pain as Hideo Kojima never fails to amaze me."

,Recommended,311340,13448421,"Posted: 19 December, 2014",all,Whiskey Dick,"I never played thE prior MGS games because of two reasons. One of which is I never owned a Playstation 3 because of the controler and the other reason is I never cared for it. But with the hype that is going around for MGS V Phantom Pain like STD's at a fraternity. I decieded to take a wack at it. This small game was indeed amazing and quite frankly I sorta wish I can go back in time and kick my younger version to play the MGS series just so I don't have to go wiki everything. During this year most of the games that came out have been nothing but dissapointments but playing this put me in the X-Mas spirit by going around Gitmo and kidnapping nearly every guard just for the laughs. The game runs unblievebly smooth at 60fps and the enivroment was outstanding visually appealing on my PC.  The only cons with this game is I don't believe the price tag for $20 dollars is right but since it went on sale for $13 dollars I don't care really anymore about the price since it is better than other the other AAA game's that have been shown this year. Overall if you want a game that raises the bar on both story telling, visual appearence, and mechanics while actually having fun with it then this is your game."
,Recommended,311340,13448628,"Posted: 19 December, 2014",all,Shinsuke Nakamura,"Fantastic Port. Fantastic Game.At a technical level it's absolutely mind blowing that it runs as well as it does. I'm maxing out the game at 1080p and I'm hitting a stable 60FPS while only using 35% of my GPU (GTX970). I have never seen my GPU usage so low while maintaining such a high framerate. Not even one dip below. I did run into 2 issues with the port however. First one is that V-Sync is a must, the amount of screen tearing without it is beyond words. I haven't seen tearing this bad in a very long time. The other issue is that the game seems to hate multi-monitor software such as DisplayFusion and Vertical Taskbars. If you have either of those (or both like me) you may need to close the software and hide the taskbar. If not the game will either give you a lovely 640x480 window(http://i.imgur.com/e2GLCke.jpg)that can't be changed or it will give you a taskbar that is permanently on screen(http://i.imgur.com/SmxQNCs.jpg).  outside of these 2 issues the port is perfect.The game itself is a blast to play. It's a great taste of things to come in ""The Phantom Pain"". The main mission itself took me 61 minutes first go and while I found it to be a bit too easy (1 retry, 0 kills, 0 alerts) the experience that it gave me overall was spectacular. If Phantom Pain is basically a 20+ hour version of this I'm so down. Also, while the main mission only clocks in at an hour first go around that only accounted for 8% of the game completition according to my stats. There are a fair amount of side missions you can do and a few hidden things to collect along with another difficulty. There is content here beyond the main story.Overall, it's a great game and while the name ""Demo Gear Solid"" is true to an extent, this is most definitely worth a purchase if you just can't wait any longer for Phantom Pain. The stealth is solid, the game is smooth and why wouldn't you want to support PC MGS?"

Running everything at maximum settings with 2 GTX 770 in SLI and an i7-4770k and getting constant 60fps. Could even use only one card, as the two are running at 50% and the game doesn't seem to need more than ~500MB of VRAM! There's not much changes from the PS4 version, just a little extra detail here and there; view distance slightly increased, lights distance increased, some little effects, like rain running on clothes, more detailed...Now for the content, the main mission is quite short as every one has propably heard since the console release, but astonishing in it's replayability, as there is many ways to complete this mission. The rest of the content is interesting as well, but seeing the same map over and over again is a bit dissapointing...It's not a big game, more of a big demo, but as the price is more reasonable on steam than it was on the consoles releases, it's pretty interesting. If you already own a PS4 or XBOX ONE copy, it doesn't add anything, so don't bother, (unless you absolutly want to see it run on your computer, then who am I to give you orders XD )."

There's a line Snake says, which goes ""kept you waiting, huh?"". Yes, and it was worth the wait to finally see another MGS come to the PC, and a well-optimized one at that after the fiasco of Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance oh-so-many years ago.
