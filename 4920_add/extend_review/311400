Anyway played it on my main gaming PC.Not many graphics options to tweak in the menu so onto the game.The open world part is poor, nothing to do except walk around getting into different cars.Anyway I gave it another chance and decided to try the racing competition mode. 4 cars racing around a city track following the arrows to help guide your way..or so I thought. The arrows was sending me round in a circle, one minute I was in first place well clear of the other cars the next minute I was in last place half of a lap behind! The problem was the course used the same parts of the track twice so the arrows was sending me in the wrong direction. Resetting the car didnt help, all this seems to do is position you next to the nearest arrow which can be from an earlier part of the track. and don't get me onto the handling of the cars or the collision mechanics of this game..awful. Also it seems the devs have mostly left this game unfinished. Just avoid it"

,Not Recommended,311400,18454345,"Posted: 13 October, 2015",all,Mr.Nonexistent,"OCEAN CITY RACING REVIEWFirst of allI'd like to start off by saying that this game is very unpolished, and unfinished. Throughout theHOURof gameplay I put into this game, I fell through the map a total of 6 times. I dont know if this game is abandon-ware left by the developer, or whether it's being worked on for it's faults.Pro's: The game has a vast majority of cars for you too use in the game.The driveable car's physics are decent at most.ANNNNDD NOW THE CON'Sthere's a lot of themCon's: The graphics for this game are awful, really poor and shameful to look at.This game feels like a really crappy mobile port too pc, since there are no graphical options whatsoever. {except for resolution etc.}The physics for theNON DRIVEABLE CARSare laughable, absolutely terrible.There is this motion blur that is really annoying that you can't turn off, and even if you move in the slightest, it'll show up and be annoying.The car's are basically all the same, they just have different looks, but they all accelerate the same, go the same speeds, and some even have the same present sounds for their engine.The A.I. for the races are absolutely terrible, they drive into walls, and can't steer straight through the track.Character Modeling for this game is almost Nonexistent because of the same NPC's that walk the street. there are a total of like, 4-5 different NPC's. who are very low res, who for some reason stand at 7 feet tall, (taller than your character, when you leave the car)THE GAME IS VERY UNPOLISHED. In free-roam, you can drive around in an open world, the map is very small, and kind of linear when you think about it. there are invisible walls, almost everywhere, and sometimes even floors that you can fall through the world with. I've actually fell off the side of the map, Literally walked too the end, and jumped off.The Free-Roam map is also unfinished, with a bridge that has a construction site on it, too even parts of the map that you can see in the distance with no ground. this map is full of surprises.Would I recommend this game? NO. It is an Unpolished, Unfinished product of an open world racing game for lowend pc's that doesn't even run well. if you want a good open world racing game, your best bets are Need For Speed, or even Forza Horizon.3/10 Because I slightly enjoyed uninstalling it."

The screenshots in the forum and the ratings speak for themselves. However, it would seem that the devs don't want the screenshots to give a bad impression of their game.Any screenshots from the older, non 'redux' version are actively being banned from the community, irrespective of whether or not they break any rules. Looking past the scumminess of this is the fact that getting your screenshots banned will get you banned from uploading any more screenshots for a period of time. The more they take down, the longer the ban is.With that being said, I wouldn't recommend this game anyway. The world is pretty small, the physics are wonky at best, and a lot of the objects and sounds that make up the world can be found for free in an asset store. There isn't much to be found here. You can find much better uses for $2.99 in my opinion."

Read on if you so desire.This game features one of the worst handling and physics I've ever experienced. Of course this is something that's not comfortable on my part and might be something good for someone else, but judging the major dislikes on this game, I don't think I need to feel alone.They've inserted 'easter eggs' for you to find, when in reality the only real easter eggs are the bugs and glitches that come out of the game and oh boy are there a TON of bugs and glitches.. oh wait did I say easter eggs? They aren't a secret at all..The optimisation for this game is beyond terrible.. oh and when you rely on memes from around 2010 to hide the game's flaws, you're absolutely being preposterous. Come the hell on, we're at the end of 2014 here. I may have never liked these 'memes' in the first place, but even now these things are as dead as a dead horse who's already vanished due to it's rotting process. (And yes, you can not run them over. Some clip through your car like ghosts, and some are as hard as titanium, they don't budge at all.)I've got this game for the full price. Even these 3 euro's were too much for something like this. With the money I'd rather buy Bad Rats.I hope this extra additional info helps out on improving insight, but I'm never touching this game again.but I might give it another shot if they improve the handling and physics, fix the horrendous flaws in the game, expand the land and start basing their comedy on something that's actually fitting in the recent gaming communities.Don't get your hopes up though, I doubt it'll ever happen.."

This game is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥and for the tiny amount of content you get its worth arounnd 70 cents, MAXIMUM. Free roam is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ you can't even access half the cars. When you drive into pedestrians they all of a sudden turn into ghosts. Every building seems to lack an entrance.Don't even get me started on Race Mode. The drivers are dopy and constantly crash into things (Which you would expect on super easy difficulty. OH WAIT THERE AREN'T EVEN DIFFICULTY LEVELS.) Maps are the same race track over and over just repainted. No story at all. I mean at all! Not even a name of the racer, you just get plopped onto a road and have to try and drive in circles while a bunch of idiots crash into eatchother behind you.   No backstory, what country you are in, why your there, how you got there. Because you can magically teleport.Free roam is just so bad I have to complain twice. Other than a couple of ramps randomly put around the 7 meter long map there is no interaction at all. About 3 npc models.  Animations are messed up so people just wave sit down then stand up and wave then sit down again.  No voice recordings. Every person in Ocean City  is mute and deaf. Oblivious to everything npcs just sit there, or should I say stand there waving and staring in the void.  You can jump! But you can't jump over anything because the characters feet are made of cement and he can only just lift his feet off the ground. Everything is badly designed and blurry. There is no end to race mode. You just do the same race over and over in a different coloured car.-23/10 ~IGN ""Great game, would bang again."""

76561198071261109,Recommended,311400,19263921,"Posted: 25 November, 2015",all,CarGuy (SN95 Squad),"tl;dr: A game with many flaws and to some, bad quality. But I've had a lot of fun with this game, it just comes down to what you're actually looking for. Want a serious racing sim? Look further. Are you searching for some (although buggy) old-fashioned fun? You might want to stick around. My recommendation however: buy it in the sales, you'll probably be better off that way.(WARNING: long review ahead, proceed with caution)General thoughtsI've followed this game since it's early days on IndieDB, I've been looking forward to it's release on Steam. Now one small, quick (but important) note: the game description is too positive. ""Features the biggest, most detailed and alive open world city"". This isnottrue. Yes, it's a decently sized city, but nothing more. Let's compare the size of the map with the size of the map of GTA V. You know that airport at the bottom of LS? Yeah, it's about that big. It's a bit more spreaded, but surface-wise, about the size of the airport. Probably even smaller, since a big portion of the map is occupied by buildings and inaccessible parking lots. Yes, it has an Underground Tube station... Sort of... It's about 50-70 metres long, and you can't go on the traintracks or on the train. Yeah, kind of dissapointing. Furthermore, the cars differ in quality, some are plain old models that are, if I'm not mistaken. taken straight from UDK. Others seem like rather crappy, low-poly models that have a bunch of modelling and texture bugs. What about the livelyness of the city? Well, maybe as lively as a town full of zombies. There are about 5 models for pedestrians, all wearing meme-shirts. You can drive straight through them, no interaction at all. They don't fall over, jump out of the way, you can't even push them around. Then what about traffic? The traffic consists of a bunch of cars (with even lower resolution!) that seem to be on Scalextric tracks. You can push 'em around all you want, but the front wheels will always point to the direction they're going, That doesn't mean they're completely inanemate, you can cause massive pileups, send them flying and make them go all sixes and sevens.Now let's talk about gameplay, shall we?The handling, let's just get on with it straight away. Ehmm, boring and obvious is the only way I can describe it. It certainly doesn't have ground-breaking physics that would putRaceroom Racing Experienceto shame. It's rather bland, unoriginal, almost as if the developer had just taken a default code for the driving physics. Which is probably what actually happened. Is that a particularly bad thing? No, most definitely not. As a manner of fact, I'd rather have someone just take a premade string of code, rather than creating their own code from scratch and messing up.RacesThis game comes with a few racemodes. Time-trial and checkpoint races. It's pretty straight forward, timetrial, you drive on your own, through one of the few courses. Finish before the timer runs out, you win. When the timer runs out and you haven't yet finished, you lose. Checkpoint races: you drive around a course with other opponents. Finish first and you'll win, and you know the rest.BugsThis game is riddled with bugs, so many in fact, it's somtimes a guilty pleasure to just play a game of 'How to break a game in as many ways as possible'. Just take this example: When you go over the bridge away from the city, you'll arrive at a teeny tiny, almost roundabout-sized island. in the middle: a bunch of rocks. Hit those rocks at high speeds, you'll jump, do massive flips with an incredible amount of air-time, and with a bit of luck, you might just land on the next bridge. It is however, way more likely you'll miss the bridge, and land in the water. Big problem? Not really. Underneath the surface of the water, or I could just say texture of a surface, there is a bonedry, hard floor. And now you can endlessly drive around in the water. But watch out, if you manage to find the edge of the map, you'll fall down into oblivion. And don't expect the reset-button to help there. When your car resets back onto the road you are closest to, the car will just freeze. You're able to bump into it with other cars, and it'll move, but you can't drive it. And once you're out of it, you can't get back in.Just a small example of a bug.Final verdict:Alright, that was a long, long review. Buy my final verdict is... 6/10.Surprised? I bet you are. This game is horribly made, I completely agree, but for the fun-factor, I'll give it a 9/10, probably. Yes, there are bugs, yes it's a short game, small map, done playing in probably two hours. But for me, it was a fun experience. It's still a fun game. But do beware: buy it when it's in the sales, when it costs next to nothing, because I sitll do not think it is worth that much money.And if you enjoy bug-hunting, this is fun as well.All jokes aside, buy it at your own risk, read the reviews, look at the trailers, maybe look up some gameplay footage on YouTube, whatever you do, take a deep thought. I had a lot of fun, but if you're after a serious racing game, look further.Raceroom Racing Experienceis a good place to start."

This is fine for me as I prefer arcade. But I've seen a few goofy things that isn't realistically possible.'unlock new vehicles as they progress'You don't get to pick what vehicle you drive in a race. Every stage in both race mode and time trials, your car is pre-selected. Every race you get assigned a different car. You can't modify the color or any parts for the car. Hardly what I would call ""Unlocking"".'players have the ability to choose one of the many tracks available'In both race mode and time trials, you cannot select a track. The track (like the cars mentioned above) are pre-determined.Those things said, the game is still an 'okay' racing game. If the developer had expanded on this a little more it would probably be a lot better. As it stands, it's a rather small racing game that will probably only keep you entertained for a few hours, at most. The cars are nice and in the free roam mode, you get to drive each one (but can't race them). The environment has a lot of things considering how small it is (beach, tunnel, narrow alley, bridge, small rural area).Overall it isn't a BAD game, it's just lacking in features."

It has really good functionality and also has incredible potential. With a little more time put into it, I'm sure it could have made the new Midtown Madness. Back in those days everyone wanted the ability to get out of the car and walk around, without having features of GTA where you'd beat up people and junk.

With that said, making games is not an easy task but there is no denying that this is a bad game.

And heres what I thought.Graphics- Amazing. It looked realistic, the lighting was perfect. Except the people. They looked horrifying. But there are many other games with these graphics. 8/10Controls- Not the best controls in the world. Its alright in free roam mode but when your in races and you turned, you would always crash. 4/10Gameplay- The map is very small, and after a while you get bored. The music? Awful. Its not even original, its Kevin Mcleod Royalty Free Music. There is 2 songs that loop over and over again. I had to turn the volume to the lowest in order to stop my ears from bleeding. 2/10Overall- 3/10 If you want a racing game, there are many out there. It was a waste of money to get this game.
