It's fun, it is challenging, but not to the point of discouraging or losing enjoyment, and it has the feel of new-and-different on every playthrough. Levels are also varied and add to the freshness of each play. There is a load of variety in weaponry and special abilities, more special weapons and abilities you can work toward, and there is a rougue-like feel throughout. If you are thinking about getting this, it's a safe bet you'll have fun with it, and can either play for a short term or long. I've put a good amount of time into this game...I suppose I like having fun, then! All in all a very pleasant surprise."
,Recommended,311480,12651703,"Posted: 26 October, 2014",all,Darian Wulfbane,"Just to relive the nostalgia, I had to go back and play the original Vertical Drop Heroes on Kongregate. This truly does its predecessor justice, giving that fantastic risk-reward system and adding so much more to it. There are some aspects of the game that are easy to exploit (using Confusion on the Worm boss makes the fight ever-so easy, especially when I know recharges are around the corner), but even with that, the game provides a good challenge and requires you to put both your platforming skills and rogue-like decision making skills to the test. I especially like the addition of the pacifist system. Normally the choice of ""To fight or not to fight"" comes down to whether or not you can gain more than you lose, but in this case with many fights being winnable without much or any loss, a reward for avoiding the easy massacres is tempting and very worth it. The story itself is also simple but very befitting; so often do games tell of the great hero that overcame evil with the dozens of game-overs in between never even being acknowleged. Knowing that each failed attempt is simply another step in the story makes me even more anxious for the next attempt.I look forward to seeing what comes out of Nerdook Productions next. Even if it's another remake of an old Flash game, I know it will be as good-- if not better than-- the original."

The first song in the early levels remind me of Maplestory, which is quite nice~If in doubt, try out the flash version that's available online free to play, its obviously less polished than the current version, but gives enough away to help decide whether to buy or not.

The player will spend their time trying to find the perfect hero to use as a protagonist (after generations of disappointments), able enough to complete the 10-level quest by which so many predecessors have inevitably failed.Approaches to play-style can differ from chaotic to tactical; the path of progressive pacifism is possible, though most will prefer to engage with blade, bolt or blast (amongst other things).It is simple to grasp, though many heroes will meet their doom early. Fortunately, no effort (death) goes unrewarded as resources (as well as abilities) stockpile, which means it is not nearly as frustrating as it should be.Skill acquisition is indefinite, meaning earned abilities become inherent, allowing for a more expansive genotype, and thus is an inspiration to continue despite the permadeath nature of the game.The only notable grievance comes within a poorly designed HUD, which can hinder co-op interactions, making for a slightly cramped feel to split screen mode.'Falling to progress' is a significant enough change logistically to alter the feel of the game from similar titles, and works to enhance the fast paced direction that the game embodies.VDH is fun without the demand of time input, and although it isn't one you would likely spend hours on, you'll come back to it often; the epitome of the casual indie.- MénageGameTrois, J."

Although a lot of it can be avoided and there are achievements for getting through levels without killing things so it's more a playstyle choice.It is a roguelike so you get to unlock new classes and perks, you can purchase persistent upgrades with currency collected throughout each level/from killed npcs; also you can levelup your character (start each game at level 1) which increases numbers (damage, hit points)."

I was surprised, but I also ended up liking what I found. It's a much more complex game now, while still keeping the fun and speed of the original.The big difference is the relationship between your character and the trapped heroes. Freeing a hero from their cage doesn't transform your player character into that hero, but instead releases the hero into the game world to fight alongside you as a friendly NPC. Luckily, your player character is no longer the powerless vanilla jump-man from the original either. In a system that, yes, is a lot like Rogue Legacy's, you start each game choosing from a trio of characters generated with different statistics, traits and equipment. You can unlock new character options through achievements and in-game merchants.My main complaint about this new system is that the AI heroes can sometimes be quite unhelpful, particularly the paladin breaking blocks you'd rather leave intact and the archer, who lacks mobility-based powers, getting stuck and being unable to contribute to the battle. AI heroes can also trigger alarms, though this never felt too obtrusive or unfair."

But from what I've experienced in that time it is pretty damn good.http://youtu.be/iDN5mB3pg6kSo to start, character selection. At first I was looking at that screen thinking there are three set character classes to choose from. But then I realised that the characters themselve are randomly generated. Yeah you can't pick and choose exactly what you want, but it is still really really cool. With procedural level generation you obviously have variety in the stages which is good. Occasionally randomly generated terrain can seem hard to navigate or get through safely, but it works pretty well overall.I liked the way the game looked. Some of it's really cute. I like the way you pretty much just wave your sword around like a feather duster when you attack and the happy expression on your characters face when you beat a boss. I liked the spiel before character selection about the prophecy and how every hero thinks that they are the chosen one but most of them die during their adventure. I think that really goes well with a game that has perma-death and where you take control a new hero after each death. The music was really cool. It and the sounds effects brought back memories of older console games like the Super Mario Brothers.So yes, I reccommend this game. I liked it and two million people having played it probably means it can't be that bad lolClickherefor more let’s play videos =)"

Gamers who ignore the ""PC Master Race"", have no idea what they are missing...This game is indeed a winner. Tried it out for a quick few min. Turned out to be 1.5hrsMuch has already been said, so, I will say the one thing that stood out to me....Videos, make this game look Frantic & Chaotic. I was pleasently suprised, to find out it plays at a far more reasonable pace, than it appears. It's not a FREAK OUT AND BOUNCE ALL OVER THE PLACE SLASHING LIKE CRAZY game. You think about which way to go, which key to use, which block to break, which enemy to go after. It's neat, and somewhat difficult to explain.The whole DIE & START OVER thing, sounds awful, but its not. Once you realize, getting as far as you can, in each run, IS the game itself, you won't mind. If you kept going, it would actually hurt the game. Each time you start, little, progressive possitive changes in your Character, make each run different. You suddenly can wizz past parts that were tough, go after that extra prisoner, snatch that extra key, and.....aaaaaaaaaand.... MAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVER! Wooot!!Give it a try.

This means that you will hit enemies when you are close enough to do that. In addition to this you have two skills that depend on which skills you have already unlocked through playing. You pick from 3 slightly different characters that are randomly given some stats (i.e. damage +50%, health -25%), skills (i.e. magic bolt, arrows, daggers) and weapons (i.e. sword, spear, bow).Your task is to descent down the ""dungeon"", kill a boss at the end of each level (or unlock the door to the next level by other means) and move to the next level. Enemies and bosses get tougher of course and you will die a lot during the process.When you die you will start from the ""village"" where you can purchase persistend upgrades for your future characters like more health, damage or better rewards from collecting pasifist-items that dissappear from the level if you kill any creatures yourself (activated shrines or allies don't count).I haven't tried the co-op at all so I can't tell if the game is more fun like that but usually more the merrier.Pros:-Cute (though mobilelike) graphics-Co-op-Easy to pick up and play couple of characters-Great distraction in between other games or activitiesCons:-Basic attack feels awful-Some cheap deaths (first time you see a boss and it one-shots you)-Movement isn't as sharp as I hoped for-The upgrades in the village don't feel fun or meaningful enoughI give the game 7/10 and probably 8/10 with co-op included. Comment here if you have tried it out."
,Not Recommended,311480,13110825,"Posted: 27 November, 2014",all,Gyver,"[Summary] (Summary first for clarity and people who don't want to read a lot)Over all a quite bad game. It would be ok as a flash game to kill an hour or two but not worth buying. The only redeeming quality is the local co-op, but the game still has fundamental issues with their design.[Combat]Very repetative and dull combat. Hitting someone isn't an issue of hitting them with you weapon but more of them being in front of you when you strike (as in the weapon never connects). Every battle is composed of hitting the opponent then stepping back quickly so you can go in and stab them again (with slight variation if you still have your spell left to use).[Store system]You can buy two things that makes you stronger. More damage and more health. You can also purchase an upgrade for the passive coins on the maps (they are worth experience and gold, they disappear when an enemy is killed).Spread out through the map are merchants selling a single ability each. These will then be shuffled into your random spells for your new generations. Most of these purchases are regretted as there is no way to confirm if an ability is good until you purchase it and use it.The store system is over all very underwhelming and it feels like the store system was added last minute to balance the fact that levels only get harder because the monsters have more health and hit harder.[Level design]Throw in random blocks in a maze where you navigate to the bottom where the boss is. Add prisoners (that help you if you let them out) and treasures. Plus a quest per level that is either find Y of X or kill Z and come back to me. The map is not designed so that you can travel upwards, to combat this there are teleporters that bring your to the beginning spread out across the map.You start from level 1 and progress upwards.  Some levels have the ability to pay gold so that you can teleport there instantly (for a negligible price) in new generations. Monster design is pretty limited, the higher level the map is the harder the monsters hit. They look different and sometimes they might be ranged but all in all this doesn't change much.[Stability]Crashed only once every 30-45 minutes and never in a way that progress was lost. Starting the game is quick and easy through Steam Big Picture Mode so this was more of a nuisance than a problem."

It is a ""side-scrolling"" platformer per se, except that you don't really go to the ""side"". The basic goal in Vertical Drop Heroes is, well, to drop vertically. It's like Ice Climber in reverse where you have to traverse and fight your way through enemies and obstacles in order to reach the bottom where you have to beat the level ""boss"" in order to ""win"".Such a simple game, so what could possibly go wrong? Nothing actually, if you only look at the gameplay. So let's look at the overall model.Vertical Drop Heroes only support local split-screen multiplayer or LAN. This is where I put my demerit points at. Being an avid cooperative gamer with lots of friends in gaming, I find it not worth the value. You have Maple Story, which is a massively multiplayer online game, and it's free. So why exactly would you pay for a game that limits your multiplayer options? No, it's not even worth it even if it's on sale. This kind of game is not something you should pay for. And no, it's not even worth all the trouble to find online multiplayer mods for it.My two cents? Only buy it if you're planning on playing alone.

The game is okay, it has unlocks, alright art style, alright enemy variety, alright music. Thats all the game is overall alright. It is not worth a price tag. I had a feeling it was going to fall into this category.Its a shallow flash game that was ported to steam in hopes of accruing revenue from it. I say, good for him but it is not worth spending money on. It falls in the same category that basically every flash game falls under. Casual and fun for about an hour and toss aside."

You know the hitbox of your enemy and your weapon. VD's controls feel far more loose. It's hard to make percision strikes when your weapon has nearly zero length, and the floatiness of both the enemies and the main character detract from the experience.To me, the Flash origins of VD Heroes were too strong for me to recommend it."

I've been looking for something to fill an itch lately that I just haven't been able to scratch. Needed my Rogue Legacy fix but I've all ready conquered that one. Tried Claustrophobia: The Downward Struggle. Meh. Okay, but nothing new. TinyKeep. Fun, but not enough to keep me coming back. Delver. All right, so admittedly that one managed to hold my attention for a while (they've done a lot with it in Early Access). Then I noticed this one was on sale today so I scooped it up. Glad I did - all ready wasted eight hours of my life on it and I'm planning on wasting more tonight.If you're looking for something that scratches the Roguelike-light (or like-like, however you want to call it) itch, look no further. There's enough random insanity in this one to keep you going for just one more game, just one more game... seven hours later. At 6.99 it's well worth it and at 2.79 it's a steal. Highly recommended."

(Example Tesla Rod enemy)  I bought this on a steam sale for and I had quite a bit of fun with the game.  I only wish it supported online multiplayer, but it does have local co-op and it supports LAN play.  After you beat the game and unlock the infinity sword (1 hit kill, 1 hit point at start) you basically are playing as a ninja.  This build is also really fun in Co-op because you can use a sword and board player as a human shield and be death incarnate to bosses and tough enemies."
76561197963518212,Recommended,311480,33875169,Posted: 29 July,all,MP,"You pick one of the three randomised character builds at the start (or pay in-game coins to re-roll for more choices). Then you choose your own path through each randomised level (not just layout, but one major variation eg. all creatures fly), descending through traps, NPCs, pickups, and of course monsters, until you reach the exit guarded by a boss.The main challenge comes in later levels when the enemies start to get deadly and more numerous. And freeing allies, whilst generally quite helpful, can occasionally cause more problems, like destroying parts of the level to kill monsters, or triggering monster reinforcement points. But it's awesome carnage, and generally only happens when freeing the knight. You can skip levels with enough keys or coins, and most levels have plenty of teleporters to get you back up to the top.VDHHD is loads of fun and more than enough replay value in the $7USD asking price. It's not easy, but it's not overly hard either, and successfully beating it ramps up the difficulty next time. It's not perfect but it's quite polished for a cheap indie, and it's certainly a one of the better roguelites for people who want a good mix of skill, variety, platforming and choices.EDIT: In 10 hours of overall playtime (multiple sittings) I did get one total freeze of the game, and that came after during a 3+ hour session. May have just been a coincidence or a once-off. I speculate that you're more likely to run into it the longer your place session, if at all."
