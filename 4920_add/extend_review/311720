76561198060963744,Not Recommended,311720,13082183,"Posted: 25 November, 2014",all,Teddy,"At first glance, it seems like a nice, pretty rogue-like game and you will probably be addicted to it for several hours, until you realize that there really isn't that much content in the game. The only ""quests"" that you receive are basically just ""go to the next level and defeat the boss"", nothing more. The villagers that you 'rescue' or acquire from clearing the levels have absolutely no impact on the game. They are just trophies who wander aimlessly in your village, walking on water and spouting nonsense. There's a moderate amount of classes to choose from, which is nice, but some are clearly outshined by others. For example, the vampire is a pretty weak class compared to the wizard who is extremely powerful compared to the rest. Each class has the exact same equipment, which I can only chalk up to laziness.I was fascinated by the game at first until I realized all of these points mentioned above. I like rogue-like games, but this game honestly needs some polishing. As far as I know, there's not even a Hard difficulty setting, only Easy and Normal. I don't hate the game, but I probably won't be clearing all stages with all classes after beating the game, since it has gotten redundant by now.Here are my suggestions as to how the game could be improved:- Make class equipment more unique. Seriously, it's pretty lame to have every character with a weapon that shoots fire or freezes enemies. It shouldn't take much creativity to come up with something less generic.- More difficulty settings. I'm a sucker for unfair challenge, and I can never understand when game developers don't implement a brutal, hard difficulty option in their games. It shouldn't be a difficult task and it will surely please hardcore gamers.- REDO THE VILLAGE. I don't even want to look at it, it's hideous. Aside from the villagers being pointless drones walking around (on water I might add, for some inexplicable reason), the quest system serves no purpose either. If you're gonna have a quest system in your game, MAKE ACTUAL QUESTS and not just a pointer saying that I have to kill the evil mushrooms in the next level, which is the only thing I can do anyway!This could be a good game if it was more polished and had more content and effort put into it, but as it stands now, I wouldn't recommend it, especially not for 15€."

Here's why:1) If you die you're right back on your feet and you simply just 'failed' your mission.2) Death has little or nothing to do with the progress you've currently obtained in terms of unlocks.  You keep all of your upgrades you have purchased, all of your gold, all of your unlocked characters and all of your unlocked inventory.That said, I really enjoy the game.  I like that it's nice to me.The enemies don't move unless you move which is similar to something like Crypt of the Necromancer so long as you're on the beat (However, there is no ""beat"" in Sproggiwood.  It's your own pacing).  Enemies have different attack patterns and some enemies even leave hazards that need to be avoided.You unlock different classes which all feel different to play in terms of everything beyond the melee combat.  The thief can swap spots with enemies or leave traps down whereas the farmer just flat out places a bomb or throws his melee weapon along with a heal.  The knight has a circular swipe, a charge, and a move to tank damage.If you find a weapon in the dungeon it'll be available for purchase (in-game cash, no microtransactions) back in your town.I haven't put a ton of time into it yet so I haven't seen everything but I've seen enough to recommend it."

It is also a rogue-like in the same vein as Shiren the Wanderer, or Chun Soft's other Mystery Dungeon games, so it is essentially a sweet little kitten that will kick you in the fork, steal your car, and then set fire to your house all the while you wonder how something so adorable could be so evil."

Decent little mobile game, but defenitly not anything special for a pc, and especially not at that price tag.The biggest problem is that the advertised ""6 classes"" are all so damned similar as to be nearly meaningless.   The gear is identical, but forces you to purchase it seperately per charecter as a time sink.  The abilities are so minorly different as to not really make playing a different class feel like a new experience...add into it the fact the game tries to force a boring grind, beating each level with each class despite the classes being the same damn thing in different clothes, and its shoulda just stayed on mobile."

I have it on my tablet and have unlocked most of the classes and spent several hours playing, now I've got it for computer as well and have played through a couple of levels for comparison. The different classes have unique attacks with a lot of flavor. The artwork is beautifully done, with vibrant colors and a great use of different color palettes to give various areas a different feel. It has multiple difficulty settings so even if you're a little put off by the grueling and punishing nature of typical roguelikes, you can set this to easy difficulty for a more casual experience which is especially nice for impatient children. My 9 year old daughter has had a blast at this and I'm hooked too."
,Recommended,311720,28319327,"Posted: 11 December, 2016",all,Audish,"Roguelikes don't have to be hard to be good. Sometimes you just want a relaxing sojourn into new lands, with adorable critters to spar with and adventures to be had. For those times we have Sproggiwood, easily one of the chillest and most charming roguelikes around. Guiding your chosen hero through quaint dungeons is a pleasure for any occasion... even after the game reveals its true colors.Sproggiwood is the story of Sproggi of Sprog, an impish little nature deity hell-bent on bringing civilization to his corner of creation. For this he turns to you, a member of the adorably boxy Cloghead peoples. As you heed Sproggi's call and tame the wildlands your little Cloghead village grows, opening up new class and equipment options to tackle dungeons with. There's no city-building to be had here (unless you really like arranging shrubberies), just a clever progression system to reward your successes and blunt your failures.This IS a roguelike, of course, so failures are expected. Each of Sproggiwood's ten missions is a descent into a different cave or dungeon of the world to beat a boss. You get one life to accomplish this task in, and any items or equipment you find on your quest are lost at the end of that quest, win or lose. Your character will also gain experience and level up in these dungeons, granting skill points to unlock or enhance the four skills granted by their class. This progression, too, is reset after each mission.If this sounds grating to you, understand that missions in Sproggiwood last a matter of minutes. Each is like a mini-roguelike dive confined to a single dungeon, and each attempt earns you currency to spend in your town. Money unlocks permanent upgrades to your stats or bonuses to various systems, or unlocks equipment to start any mission with. You have to find an item before you can purchase it but in a way this allows you to hang onto that sweet, sweet life-sucking sword you found that one time.The roguelike and progression systems are sound, and luckily they are appended to a simple but very effective gameplay loop. Movement in dungeons is turn-based as most classic roguelikes are. Your basic attacks hit adjacent to your character but among the four skills of each class there are almost always ranged or area attacks to unlock. The classes are all smartly designed with combat and mobility options that can be used to great effect, such as the Archer who has several ranged and piercing attacks along with a chainable combat roll. You can also find potions and scrolls that grant dramatic effects, and shrines and treasures to gain new boons from.You will need all of these tools to tackle Sproggiwood's precious foes, for none of them are simple fodder. Even the most basic slimes and ambulatory mushrooms have special skills like leaving slippery puddles or sneaking up on you. Later enemies can have abilities that require extensive planning to counter such as the twin fish that must be beaten simultaneously or the infamous black slimes which reproduce wildly if left unchecked. Bosses also have gimmicks that must be strategized around, though they tend to be larger versions of common foes.Once you come to grips with the class concepts and the battle system, it's smooth sailing through the game. Every time you beat a mission with a different class you'll get a large cash influx to further bolster your heroes, and later upgrades can make you nearly unstoppable. You should have little trouble beating the game, at which point you might notice there's a third difficulty beyond Easy and Normal, called Savage. You might decide to give this mode a try, at which point the adorable goatmen and frogs you've been wailing on will curbstomp your face into paste. Savage difficulty gives new behaviors to ALL the monsters in the game, most powerful enough to make even the lowliest slime an existential threat. As likely as you were to beat the regular game, you'll have to work your♥♥♥♥♥off to even have a hope of conquering Savage.This, really, is the beauty of Sproggiwood. It's a marvelous introduction to the roguelike genre with its simple, engaging combat and charming presentation. Should you grow bored of breezing through dungeons, though, there's a whole world of constant kicks to the teeth you can pit yourself against. The critters are just as adorable in any difficulty, with their soft colors and thick lines. The soundtrack also deserves some major recognition for hitting the pastoral fantasy mark dead-on. It's one of the few soundtracks I've gone out of my way to purchase because of how perfectly it evokes the right mood. Really the same could be said of the whole game, from the hilarious writing and clever story all the way down to the combat that never really gets old. Sproggiwood hits all the right notes for a game that can relax or challenge, all while keeping a smile firmly affixed to your face.Did you enjoy this review?

I don't really want to go back and replay the dungeons with the other classes even though I did mess around with em for a little bit and they're all really fun (aside from the thief imo); however, like I said, the mobs and combat is too repetitve to make me wanna go back to it. I did enjoy the combat style though.Story wise it wasn't that great either. Fairly entertaining dialogue but no character depth or intricate plot twist / story. Maybe I expected too much, but the storyline was a bit too straightforward for me.If I remembered that Steam does refunds, I would have probably stopped before the 2 hr mark and asked for one :( I think it had a lot of potential, but fell flat. Hopefully the company continues to make games and improves em on a few fronts cause dat art style tho.Overall, this was the first game of this type that I've ever played so I will admit that I enjoyed myself fairly well (will probably seek out this play style in the future), but I would not recommend buying it unless you were buying it really cheap like in the $2-3 mark."

Note I have a personal weekness for rogue-likes and enjoy the live fast die young nature of the genre. Oddly enough many of the issues other users have mentioned as cons I find to be pros (see below for more detail). Overall Sproggiwood is quirky, charming, albeight somewhat short.* Graphics: Cute and minimalistic without crossing into the highly abused 'pixel art' catagory that is common in rogue-likes* Music: Matches the graphics in charm. Nothing groundbreaking but rather subtle and ambient* Complexity: The game is strikingly easy to learn while sitll allowing you to taylor your playstyle based on your class. Be prepared to die nonetheless (especially on savage mode)* Replayability: the game rewards you for finishing each dungeon with each class. That said you could still beat all of the dunegons with all of the classes fairly quickly on normal mode. Up to savage for more of a challenge.* Length: The game is overall rather short espically if only observing the dungeon count* Price: The base price is a little high for what you get compared to some other popular rougue-likes on the market. However if you're a fan of the genre and can find it on sale I'd strongly reccomend picking it upTL:DR: Cute. Short. Would reccomend if you get it on sale."

I got this game on sale when it was only a couple dollars instead of $15, and that's really all it appears to be worth.Pretty much it's as the other more critical reviews say, you play through 10 levels, though you're expected to play each level at least 6 times to beat it with a different class that offers little difference strategically. The six classes each come with individual items specific to that class that you have to purchase separately, making grinding a necessity assuming you actually care to purchase the items (spoiler alert: you won't). I ultimately just bought a potion that scrambles your powers from what's available between the six classes and even that only made for a slightly interesting playthrough of a dungeon I already beat four times. Ultimately, I finally stopped caring and just chose to progress through the game without bothering with the achievements because it got so monotonous.The art style is cute, but that's really all the game has going for it. It's a good time waster, but you could simply purchase it on a mobile device for a quarter of the cost and it'd amount to the same as what's being played here. Your civilization you're supposed to be building that is apparently the entire point of all this is little more than some trees and houses that you can easily ignore and the quest system might as well not even be there given that you really only have one line of quests to take with the sole exception of the Holiday content. The storyline itself is cute and a little funny, but otherwise not very engaging as we see what is coming to appear as a foregone conclusion.In short, get the game if you want to, but get it on sale."

Its fun.In addition, the little ""town"" that slowly gets populated by all sorts of creatures and beings you unlock in the dungeon can be built the way you want it. It seems to be for the hell of it, I dont know if theres a gameplay benefit. But I was having fun putting down cottages with little ""roads"" a town square with hedges water and a tree, and across the bridge, a mansion with dead trees around it.Its cute, its fun.

It blends a variety of game features such as stages with star ratings, RPG elements like equipment upgrades and purchases, and in-stage leveling.  It is not the type of game where you follow a character that you develop over the course of the game.The ""village"" building element, so far, feels like little more than decoration and has little value other than the fun of organizing and clicking on residence - not my jam, but some people like that.  The story also feels a bit lacking.  But hey, it is meant to be a casual game, not an deep drama.It is not overly easy - as you do ""die"" and fail to pass stages until you save enough coin to upgrade your heros' equipment and such.  The stages generate with enough variability so that it is not repetitive.   All in all, it is a good time killer and worth the $10 or so."

You just have to purchase some passive abilities (more xp gain, more starting health) and some items for your heroes. Each hero has fifteen or so items, but you only really need a couple.Beating the game doesn't take very long, and after that you've basically seen everything there is in the game.

There are 10 stages each with a unique boss and 6 classes each having 4 special skills, and you can unlock global upgrades with your hard-earned coins from the dungeons.These elements are typical for most of the popular rogue-like games, except for the cute art style. However, Sproggiwood fails to offer more. The sound effect and music are okay, but nothing impressive. The story is barely better than nothing. The difference in environment is purely aesthetic and does not influence the battle. Although it may still be an exciting challenge for hardcore fans of this genre to finish all the stages on the savage difficulty with all classes, the game play quickly become old  because of the lackness in variety of the enemies, loots and equipment.If you want a short enjoyable time of about 5 hours immersing yourself in a rogue-like game with good arts, I recommend this game when it's on sale.

The Finnish folklore shines through. The gameplay is tough enough to make you frustrated once in a while, but otherwise it's just pure fun. Hoping the developers will add more and expand on this! Really enjoying it so far and it's fast approaching my favourites list.However, the town really only serves as a dynamic background for your ""organizational"" activities, and it is a little strange not having to re-purchase potions and things; they're unlimited once you've purchased them once. Levels could be a bit bigger, and like some people have said, the ""quests"" aren't really quests at this point, it's really linear unless you switch it up yourself by beating levels with the different classes.

It doesn't bring new game mechanics to the table, it doesn't delve into some deep storyline, and it doesn't tap into the depths of player skill for its critical gameplay aspects.That being said, it doesn't HAVE to do all that.

76561198025609284,Recommended,311720,14017132,"Posted: 16 January, 2015",all,Dick Gently,"This is a casual roguelike with very pleasing graphics and a fantastic soundtrack. I found the challenge sneaks up on you as the first level lulls you into a sense of ease, but the difficulty ramps up somewhat unexpectedly and not in a bad way. You slowly find yourself taking more careful steps as you play or you start dying a lot.It's not a traditional roguelike in the sense of true permadeath and endless junk inventory management. You gain equipment to take with you and unlock classes through the story as you build up a small village, something akin to Rogue Legacy's method of increasing danger while increasing player resources. There's no inventory. You get one weapon, one armor, one consumable, and one accessory. In your village, you can purchase these items to have available for adventuring. Each class (there are 6) has a separate weapon type and armor type and you unlock new ones to purchase in your village through adventuring as that class.You get one chance to clear a dungeon. If you fail, you can start over with a new procedurally generated dungeon that ends in a boss fight. Each dungeon is themed and increases in difficulty at every chapter. You gain gold during your delve which can be spent on upgrades in the village. Previously defeated dungeons will spawn new mobs as the story progresses, which reflects plot developments within the main story.The turn-based combat is where Sproggiwood really shines. It feels like a roguelike in the sense of grid-based, turn-based combat, but the enemy and character skills will keep you on your toes. Skills cost stamina to use and killing enemies rewards stamina. It quickly generates a feeling of chess where you're trying to outmaneuver your enemies. Purely bashing your way through the dungeon is not viable. You will need to use your class's four skills cleverly to avoid damage and keep your stamina up. Your gear will have special effects that will help you in the dungeon. Unlike traditional roguelikes, your decision about where to move to, or not move, is very key to survival. There's slimes that create bomberman style explosions when defeated, slippery puddles, and a host of other effects. Spiderwebs will make you lose a turn. Goatmen will charge across the map to ram you. I find the combat in this game to be a very fun exercise in proactive and reactive thinking.Finally, the story is a fun read. It's humorous, well-written, and makes sense within the Sproggiwood universe. You will quell the dissention of a blob social philosopher, deliver messages of peace (by any means necessary), and generally bungle your way to victory.The devs are responsive on the forums and have ideas for post release. I'm hoping to see the addition of an ""endless"" dungeon, but even so, going back and replaying previously beaten levels with the various classes really offers a new challenge, ultimately providing quite a bit of replay value.I would be inclined to point out bad things about this game, but for what the game is designed to be, it does everything very well. I honestly can't think of anything bad to say about this game.Ah, yes, I thought of something. The village decoration. A point I forgot about. You can apparently decorate your village with pleasing aesthetics, such as placing a bridge over the river. I'm not sure why the devs added this content and I have not really done much with it. I won't begrudge giving the player the ability to decorate his village, but it seems to have no real purpose in the game and I'd much rather the devs work on the actual gameplay than playing village dress-up."

Very approachable creatures and heroes.When you get them nice equipment feels really good to wield, like elemental weapons.You generously regain 1 point of stamina per monster kill, so swinging around your low-cost skills is fun.NEUTRALI was hoping the town aspect was a bit more than it is, but all you can do is just drop things around like a diorama. It still looks good, but that was a bummer.Upgrade paths are shallow and fill out rather quickly. In a way this makes it easy to see what road you'll take for the first few hours of the game, but then nothing much to look forward to with half the map to even uncover.BADFor the most part, combat is largely a chore and frustrating. The game becomes one of placement and thinking 3 steps ahead to see if you can get out of an encounter unscathed, but enemy types like regenerating black slimes and frogs that read your inputs make it hard to do. Often enemies will know exactly if a bomb brethern is fated to explode or not on the next turn to calculate if they can chain you into an explosion and so forth. I wish I liked the combat but more often than not I'd clear a level and just sigh.It does an absolute disservice to the game to incentivize repeating previous levels with different classes. The flow of the game then becomes: beat the same level 4-6 times with some runs just getting bad rolls for levels and having to start over. This makes me feel like I've been stuck on the same part of the map for eons with no hope of seeing the other areas in a timely manner.Some classes just never feel like they have options. Specifically the vampire class, who may be left using basic health stealing abilities against a boss when, the mobs that were saved up, may have been killed by chain lightning proc'd from armor. Again this goes back to how the combat, more often than not, just makes you feel like you've been driven into a corner with no way out.SUMMARYSproggiwood is a decent game with some phenomenal art, but frustrating combat and an empty town mode make me lean towards not recommending this to people. If you like this class of game, aka combat where mobs/actions take place once you've pressed a button, then you MIGHT enjoy this game; however, I was unable to latch onto Sproggiwood after playing half the game."

I therefore recommend getting it on sale. The videos of my attempts are below so you can decide whether it is worth getting at full price.I would classify the game as a casual game, which each ""quest"" lasting 15-30 minutes, so you can just pick it up and play for half an hour, then put it down to do something else. As other reviewers have mentioned, the early quests are linear, and are all of the same type (go kill the boss). The ""dungeons"" are procedurally generated, so they vary each time.  According to the game, there is a decision branch somewhere further down the path, but I  have yet to reach that point.The story and graphics are well done, cute, and humorous. The monsters and equipment are great as well.I initially thought that you can build the village to affect the main game play, but that turned out not to be the case. There are buildings that are automatically built each time you unlock a character class, and buildings that you can put down strictly for decorations.Between the randomly generated dungeons and the six character classes -- each with their own equipment -- there are quite a bit of replay values. I can see myself spend about 20 hours total on the game (6-8 with the main character class and the rest trying out the different classes/equipment.)Video of my play through upto and including the first quest:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMLV3r_L_PQ&t=5sOne interesting twist of the game play is you start almost from scratch for each quest save for the equipment, so the quests will get progressively more difficult."

,Recommended,311720,12631206,"Posted: 25 October, 2014",all,Neohanja,"It's a cute little time killer, and the dungeons are horribly long. It is a partial-rogue like though, since there is no perma-death, and little fear of doing something stupid. But it can claim rogue like since it does have procedural dungeons.It is a fun game, but here is my list of pros/cons (So far):Pros:- Cute and fun, doesn't have the ""pixel art"" graphics a lot of the newer indie games have (I do like the pixel art style, but this graphic style works too)- You can re-arrange things you earn in your town so that is looks more unique to what you want, and there is no cost to ""buy"" new ""decorations,"" though some must be unlocked (understandably).- Fun, useful (if a little overpowered at times) items to find and equip.Cons (This list may seem longer, but honestly, the Pros are still better):- You have to unlock every other class in the game (besides the initial farmer). While not bad, can be annoying picking between who to unlock. Negated upon playing though, so not horrible.- Can't rotate buildings you place in your ""town.""- Items (Weapons/Armor) found in dungeons cannot be kept; you must buy them in town first then you have perma-use of them.- (Edit, added) After playing a while longer, seems you don't keep your level(s) between dungeon, so every dungeon you start at level 1, *again* - This is actually a little frustrating, but is also part of the game play I suppose.- I would like to be able to name my little adventurer(s). I love customizations. Plus, the skills are limited in selection for my taste - especially for a $14.99 game.- Dungeons can be rather short- The initial story is some what annoyingly confusing. I don't want to spoil things, but it changes 3 times before you hit the first dungeon (not the tutorial ""walk in a straight line""). It makes me almost not want to see what the story line does next, since it does change so much suddenly, in a ""ok, I lied, this is what is really up now.""It is a fun game, and worth a try, but maybe at a discounted price. More of a $4.99 indie game in my opinion."

Wow! Gosh! ""procedural dungeons"" ""civilization building"" ""six classes"" ""rougelike""I really hate to have to come back to this game having played through its entirety (to get my money's worth) and leave a bad review. In all seriousness, my first five to seven hours of this were great! I love smashing pots. Killing monsters. Making money. Changing classes. Great! But I've come to expect a lot more from games that tout rouge-like elements.After my initial romance with sproggiwood, I realized pretty swiftly that the difficulty was well below anything that required strategy. The total enemy encyclopedia including bosses must total something like twenty? Thirty? Theres slimes, spiders, goats, sheep, creeper farmers, wisps, mushrooms, frogs, and a single fish monster. Then theres a boss for each of the nine ""different"" levels.Dungeons are about three floors a piece with a total of usually 4 to 9 rooms per. Maybe fifteen minutes to clear a dungeon? Though honestly certain classes can go for about five if you dont care about the money involved (and quickly you wont.)I will say this. The music, the environmental effects, and the scrolls and potions were a ton of fun. This is a great game until you realize how small it is, and how completely lacking in replayabillity. I buy rougelike games, like dungeons of dredmor, because of the sheer amount of replayabillity they offer.However, sproggiwood doesnt have the story, or the deep gameplay necessary to involve itself with such a shimmering and drawing game description here on steam. By all means, buy the game if youre easily satisfied and are a total beginner when it comes to RPG titles or rougelike genre games.But steer clear of sproggiwood if you've already cut your teeth on anything else!

You can stop them respawning by  running over their remains but this hurts you.

I reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys casual games but also likes the progression of RPGs with loot and what not.However there are a couple things I think could be improved. To move in a direction you have to use the arrow keys or WASD, but you can't hold down a certain key to keep going in that direction. I can see why they did this being the enemies react to your movement, but when you just want to go a far distance pretty quickly and don't have to worry about enemies it can get somewhat annoying to constantly hear ""click click click click."" Perhaps they should add the ability to hold down shift while pressing a movement key to simulate pressing that key once every half second or so. Also another minor annoyance is the way the text scrolls when characters speak. The text while start to appear and then move upwards to make way for the new text on the line, which makes it difficult to read quickly. Hard to explain, but you will see what I mean next time you look. I don't know why it was programmed like this but it is kind of annoying.Those two small issues are no reason not to get the game, it really is fun and relaxing. I'd give it an 8/10Joe"

There are several upgrades you can do to your village which affects how you play the levels.  The issue is, the levels are barely procedurally generated.  Each level all you will see that is differant is the layout of the vases, webs and traps which a few tile sets being different than the last game you played.  It is pretty lazy.  The monster variety is also pretty lazy.  You have oozes, giant goat men, flying pigs with lasers, flame vampires etc.  The enemy variety is what will exhaust you.  You will witness the same mobs level after level.I got Sproggiwood on sale.  At 50% off I'd say it's worth it, but definately NOT 15.  There isn't enough content here and the level design is flat and just not that procedural for my liking.  If you're a fan of rogue like games, pass this one up and buy the developer's other game, Caves of Qud if you want a true rogue like dungeon crawler."

The cost: seriously though, for almost 9$ on a 50% off sale this game is brutally overpriced. People like to compare the cost of games to the cost of movies, so hey, I'll do that here and let you know you could have gone to two movies for the cost of this game and two movies might net you 5 hours which is what this game is as far as length.2. The length: you think that sometimes the cost isn't bad because you can get your money's worth out of the game think again with Sproggiwood, in two hours I have completed 4 missions and replayed each of those missions at least 3 times, there are around a total of 9 missions which means if you don't replay any missions you are talking about beating the game easily in under 5 hours. The game then by all accounts would become a grind game to get enough gold to turn into money to turn into items so that you can play the same missions again on harder difficulties, which brings me to3. The game is by all accounts designed from the ground up as a FTP phone game: the in game city which amounts to nothing more than the ""in game store"" coupled with missions that are designed to be grinded over and over again to build up frustration levels to the point that you will just pay real money to buy the items, the ""touch screen screen drag"", and on and on... After putting in only a few hours it was crystal clear what this game was.4. Champions (if you can even call them that) don't retain level: meaning this isn't your typical dungeon crawler where you level up and get stronger and stronger as you go along in the game- no, this is broken up into nine ""missions"" and each mission you start at lv 1 each and everytime you play it you have to relevel up your champion and refind the same items to equip on the same person (that is, unless you went and bought the items in the store, then you can equip said items before the mission, otherwise you go into each mission lv 1 and ""naked"" again).5. Ridiculously long tutorial designed to get you over the 2 hour mark on Steam and/or pad out this short, short, short game. This one is self explanitory, it is a very very very long and indepth tutorial for one of the simplest dungeon crawlers you will ever play. Didn't appear like there was any way to skip it so replaying the game seems like even if you wanted to (don't see the reason to as you just replay the same missions over and over again) it would be a nightmare.6. Reused assets: played in 3-4 missions (50% of game) and I saw the same world, same creatures, same trees to cave to trees in every single mission. People complained about Heroes of a Broken Land having reused assets, this game takes it to a whole new level... This is like The Banner Saga without even trying to be tactical and without an awesome Viking storyline...7. The ""build your town"" screenshots and video for the game are a hoax, the city building is nothing more than aestetics that has no impact on the game itself... Like I said before, it is just a ""store front""...8. First strike = the entire game: this game's combat is entirely based on the concept of ""first strike"", meaning ""wait a turn for the enemy to move to the space beside me and then kill it in one hit"". Everything dies in the game in one or two hits which means 95%+ of all battles pre-boss fights are just waiting for enemies to come to you and first striking them, the boss fights (the four I fought) were all designed to have you be leveled up (remember you have to level up again each time you play a map) and pick all the ""ranged abilities"" when you level up so that you could just kill the boss from a distance (as the first four bosses killed you basically in a single hit if they got within range). This is frankly totally unexceptable for a 15$+ game! It is like we just want to pretend that Terraria never happened!9. Roguelike genre is super saturated: there are a ton of these games, some of them are great some of them are terrible and some are simply overpriced- Sproggiwood is two of those three..."

,Not Recommended,311720,16408666,"Posted: 14 June, 2015",all,TRUCKFIST,"The problem with this game is the artwork.  With better artwork, character design, and environments, this would probably classify as a good game.  The mechanics are really quite solid, with each class genuinely havnig a unique playstyle and there's good balance to the rogue-lite aspects of the experience.  I quite like the notion of each run being balanced around a given quantity of experience, a set number of pots and chests.  There's very good fundamental design in here.  But jesus the art is just not nice to look at.  The whole thing feels like it was made with clip art, and that makes it hard to love or respect the game.  Hell, even the writing - satirical though it mostly is - is fairly intelligent.It's tough.  I've played a lot of roguelikes, and this one gets more of the fundamentals right than most games with much larger budgets.  But the presentation really holds it back.  I've seen too many games that go the self-aware parody route, and I think it's just lazy.  Commit to a visual theme.  Build a world around that.  Don't just populate a grid with whatever you can get your hands on."

The gameplay mechanics are well thought out where you have to plan each move based on what types of enemies are around you, where exactly they are and how many.  It pays as well to choose wisely where you place skill points and which items you equip.  Different classes definitely require different strategies as well.  Many rougue-likes do not shine as well in this area.And yet the gameplay remains fast paced.  At least as much as you want it to.Story and dialogue are humorous and interesting.  And overall not overdone, no eternal clicking to get past the waves of text and back to playing.Graphics are good, colorful and engaging.Downsides are minimal but here they are.  There is no ""end game"" or more accurately, nothing to do after winning.  Which is kind of disappointing since it's a fairly short play through and you'll be wanting more.  You end up with way more awesome classes than you started with, and a ton of gold - but nothing to do with them.Only other word of caution is that if at any time you so much as click ""new game"" from the title screen your current save will vanish forever."

Said story is fun enough and the few characters you meet during your adventure are quite silly and will easily make you smile.At 15 to 10 dollars (depending on whether it's on sale or not) it might be a bit overpriced for what it does but it's a good experience nonetheless."
