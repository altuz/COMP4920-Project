It's no different to other Lego games in its mechanics - smash stuff to collect studs with which to buy other characters and such. Hidden throughout levels are minikits, same as every other game. What makes this one different for me is the fighting. In other Lego games it's kinda a case of ""mash the attack button until you win,"" but in this one you can time it so you can block as well, and there's sometimes a nice back and forth which gives it a really fun swashbuckling feel, as you'd expect and hope for in a pirate game.The style of narrative is the same as other games too, told in a slapstick silent-movie style. This really helps to explain the third and fourth movies to me, since I couldn't follow them at all compared to the first two. Also there are no forced speeches to break up the flow ^.^So if you like Lego games as a concept, you'll probably enjoy this. The music is great, the combat is fun, the levels are well designed and fun to smash through.. I just really like this game ^.^"

The graphics have improved a lot, the cutscenes are longer and actually have much more entertaining humor, plus they are more relevant to the movies. In the beginning, I was skeptical since the first few missions aren't that great and the formatting seemed a little different, but once I got into it, it quickly became very entertaining.  I have never encountered any technical problems or bugs whatsoever, so I would be skeptical about believing some of the other, more negative reviews in that regard. All in all, I'd give it an 8.5/10. I highly recommend this game and think it has made some very good changes from past games such as the new sword combat, but the only real negatives I can think of are the fact that they cut vehicle missions and that there are only 5 levels per movie instead of 6."

My girlfriends loves to play with Will Turner.. eheh!Sometimes the game might stuck and I don't know what is missing to continue, it happened twice to me but I enjoyed it anyway because loading time is fast and you would not mind replaying the same mission.. compared to other games who would ask you to replay old mission and I promptly say ""no"".If you've ever played these lego game, you know already the gameplay style and you can't miss this title!!If this would be your first lego game, you'd love it ;)And always remember that these lego games are much better when played with a friend :D"
,Recommended,311770,29262855,Posted: 14 January,all,Eauxps I. Fourgott,"I think this is the shortest of the LEGO games I've played - only took 23 hours to get to 100%.But short does not equal bad, in this case. There's still plenty enough content, and this is a good solid LEGO game. Some minor flaws (plus the death of the character customizer as an actually fun tool), but nothing glaring. It does a good job of combining the gameplay of the older, classic games with the fresh coat of paint of the newer games. Great work done with balancing of character abilities. No voice acting yet. I'm not super fond of hiding all of the extras in the hub, but it's okay. Only five levels per movie this time, but balanced out by the fact that there are four movies. On the whole, a good fun game.What does the POTC brand offer to the LEGO games? Really weird storylines that are hard to grasp, for one, especially in the second and third movies. And a whole lot of levels on pirate ships. But I think this game might be the best at offering opportunities for fun acrobatic stuff, and you get to hear that iconic music that makes the scene feel super epic a bunch of the time. Definitely works with the franchise, making this an enjoyable game and worth getting.One caveat, though. This offers nothing particularly novel or different from the other LEGO games. It will be a very similar experience to the others. So if you wanted something different, you don't have it here. On the other hand, if you just want another, fine-quality LEGO game, you've got it here."
76561198032077057,Recommended,311770,13577906,"Posted: 24 December, 2014",all,Knux897,"I'm a big fan of the Lego Travller's Tales games and I've played them all, either on PC or console. LEGO® Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game takes some of my favorite movie content and applies it to the fun formula that is used in these types of games.So is it worth it? Well yes, but if you're as big a fan of the POTC series as I am, you might find yourself a bit dissappointed. My biggest dissappointment with the game was the lack of Hans Zimmer's great score, which is an essential part of the success of the movies. You'll find many recognizable tracks such as ""Jack Sparrow"" and ""The Kraken"" but much of the score is missing and instead is replaced with mediocre music that doesn't compliment Zimmer's score. Why? Well I have two guesses:1. The creators of the game did not believe the music would fit with the pace of the levels they designed. If this is true, I completely disagree with their decision.2.  Because the game is using Disney intellectual property, obtaining the rights to the music was expensive for Travller's Tales. I find this the more probable case.My other problem with the game is that it's buggy. I haven't experienced the crashes that other people have, but I have encountered annoying bugs. The most annoying takes place on the last level, where an event doesn't take place as it's supposed to and you're pretty much stuck. The only way to beat the level is to restart and go through the whole thing, hoping it doesn't bug out again. I've encountered this bug on both the PC and console versions.So would I recommend the game? Well despite the minor bugs and the lack of Zimmer's score, I would say yes. It's a fun game that uses familiar lego mechanics and captures the spirit of the movies. If you're a fan of TT lego games or the POTC movies, you'll probably enjoy this game."

It took me longer than usual because this game crashed a lot. I had to play 4 times the same level and IT KEPT CRASHING. I guess the game crashed 10 times overall. It wasn't because I was pushing my computer too hard. The Lego was the only thing working.I used to play Lego and use skype and chrome at the same time, so I think the problem is in this game.Other than that, really liked it. I love Lego games. Not a surprise there. And I also love Pirates of the Caribbean. I prefer that the red bricks (or hats) are inside the levels - makes them harder to get because you usually have to get a super hard character.Also, you could play the levels even if you didn't follow the order which meant that you could just first get captain Beard (not his name) and then work the free play of the levels to get money to buy red hats. Not complaining but it would make the game harder.It was one of the easiest games but it was really really cool.Cons:-Keeps crashing-No Steam achievements-Red hats in the hub, not in levelsPros:-It's lego-It's pirates of the caribbean-It's legoIf you like Lego games, buy this one.

Updating this game would be great but of course that most likely won't happen.It has a great setting and different features while some are still the same to other lego games.The good ol no talking lego games where you can tell what they are truely describing.Whats good as it's a goodsort of quest getting 100%, while this one was probably the shortest one to achieve this goal.As of going in depth the game does pullout the good ol gold brick collection with true pirate and the minikits. Also adding a 4th sort of quest being the compass. The use of different enviroments, some being all about puzzles while some are just confusing is a good twist while sometimes honestly just get you wandering around for 20 minutes straight until you finally realize what you have to do.The difference from very old to the newer lego games can be seen but is still a good standard for nice singleplayer games these days. It's a lego game and has great different extras and choices in levels, although they're all pretty straight foward and basically like a 2 check to do list. It's still great and contains lots of nice different tricks and solutions.Pros: Great story and clipsGreat chapters and well fit scenes/episodesA good range of charactersA good hubExtras and other optionsAble to explore with free play etc.The music really adds to punch to it making the scenes feel extra epic'Basically tell the movies in a very good strange summery.A bonus level so that's coolCons: For some reason this bug didn't allow me to get 100% because of the fast dig red hat. When you use the barrel the first time and decide to open the hut door that'll activate something so you aren't able to do the barrel thing again, because you've already unlocked the hut, making the hat unachieveable.Has quiet a few more crashes randomly and frequently than others.Sometimes you get stuck with something when apprently theres a rope or a small like thing you have to destroy you can hardly see.Sometimes the game randomly just glitches, e.g when fighting Davy Jones at 1 heart left he was supposed to run away but got caught on the rope instead, making him invicable.The compass can be a big misleading, especially on the 5th level of Chapter 1 etc.----------------------------------Overall this game is a great load of fun and can be a good goal to achieve 100% and different quests if you have free time or what that good ol expereience of lego games puzzles etc. Its probably the only lego game with trading cards so that's a bonus although with no achievements on pc could've helped itWell its currently on sale so just have a moment and witness the weird pirate sort of stupidness and adventure."

First i decided to try Pirates of Caribbean since it's one of my favourite movies.This game have nice grafic,funny gameplay and interesting puzzles - and that's mostly everything pozitive i can say about it.After cca 30 minutes-1 hour of playing,game will crash to desktop without any error message. It's not only ,many other people suffer from constant crashes-and there is no any patches that would've fix it,what's pretty lame for a game that carry ''LEGO'' in it's name.There's also no any tutorial,it took pretty while to catch how to play.There is also no any voice actors in this game.Skip this game,any buy any other Lego game. I tried Hobbit after this failure,it's thousand times better,and of course,there are no any bugs,glitches or crashes in Lego Hobbit."

I say tried to play because I could never complete a level without it either crashing or it hitting some glitch that prevents you from completing the level and having to start over again.

,Recommended,311770,32965321,Posted: 28 June,all,FiredGeneral®,"A typical Lego game with nothing really different, follows the POTC movies and it is actually a lot of fun. Recommend it to anyone who likes Lego games, you don't necessarily need to have watched the movies since I didn't remember any of them and still had fun. Only downside is that like all the old Lego games, the characters don't actually say anything during the cutscenes so it was nearly impossible for me to completely understand what was going on in a cutscene but still, a magnificent game. I only experienced one crash when I was into the game for like 20 mins but after that it was smooth and didn't encounter any other problems. Definitely a great game that can both be picked up during a sale (which I suggest you need to buy this on a sale, if you don't want to pay the full price) or for full price too, if you have the money. Deserves all kinds of appreciaton whatsoever, just play it people."

Some I like more than others and this is one I had to have on my PC, thtough Steam, as well. Mostly because there are 3 of us sharing the Xbox and I don't get as much game time there as I do on my PC.This game is great. Per all the Lego game - ""SMASH ALL THE THINGS!"" - which is always fun. The fact they made Jack actaully stagger and act drunk, like in the movies, is truly amazing. He can be hard to control but you get used to it and it is a detail many gaming companies would have skipped.The controls, for me being used to the Xbox, are a bit difficult. Trying to get characters to move in a diagonal direction with just straight arrow keys is tough. I had to abandone the game for awhile becuase I got frustrated at one point, but am willing to give it another try. The new Steam Machines come with a controller but I don't know if that will help with these older games.Anyway, Lego Pirates is probably my favorite of the Lego games and I will play it again and again and again.I highly recommend this one."

I originally platinumed the game on PS3 and bought it again here on sale. (LEGO games get heavily discounted, usually down to $4.99 for ones over a year old, during Steam's semi-annual sales. There's really no reason to pony up $20 each for these older games.) My only complaint is a completion-breaking bug involving the fireworks minikit in the Tortuga level. None of the suggestions that I've found here (e.g. verifying game cache, restarting, reinstalling) or elsewhere online have helped me solve that particular problem. It would bother me a lot more if I hadn't already gotten 100% progress on the PS3 version."

Most glitches can be fixed by leaving the level and starting it again. It can be frustrating but I haven't found that it impairs my playing enough for me to stop playing the game. Another problem I have is the game does crash. I'm ALMOST positive it is the game and not my computer, because I do have a new computer and other games don't crash on it. Then again, there is a very slim chance that it is my computer's fault and not the game.The game is definitely fun! If the game is one sale, GO FOR IT! It's a lot of fun once you get past a few frustrating things. The only sad thing is that I have been playing for only 25ish hours and I am 80% complete with this game.
