(mabe use pre-sets in town sectors to avoid parkour breaking issues ?)Overall Score: 8.5/10This game is perfect for players who like FPS/RPG Games based in the electronic-world.A Must Play Whit Friends !"

But as it stands, I'm not gonna recommend it.  Why?  Because all it really has is potential.  Potential, and a lot of circle-strafing.I can see so many ways this could go that would add depth to the game.  Servers could spawn out terrain chunks or static defenses or semi-random combat puzzle elements.  Hacking tools could provide weird options and recontexualization of combat, like letting you set up warp gates or turn off gravity Matrix-Style, or trade the ability to escape for faster hacking time or something.  Your weapons and programs could let you lock down enemies, subvert control of enemy ICE, or maybe even force a swarm of those little crawlers to merge into a big boss that's paradoxically easier to fight.  Hell, maybe a weapon that targets an enemy, and instead of shooting them, it spawns little target points around it, and does massive damage when you hit all of those.  Challenge vs damage output sorta thing. These are just ideas off the top of my head, mind you, and I'm sure the creator has more than a few of them in mind already.But none of these things are in it.  Instead, it's just a shooter where the only real way to fight is circle around and shoot anything that moves.  It's a bit like Doom, if Doom took place on a flat open space, and your guns didn't feel like Thor punching through drywall.  Moving feels clunky when you get stuck on enemies.  Which is bizarre, since there's no other things to get stuck on.  The whole game feels like that.  Empty.  Waiting for something to happen.And I really do want something to happen.  I paid for this game because I love where it could go.  But right now?  Right now, I wouldn't tell my friends to buy this.I'll revisit this review in a few months, and at least after the full version comes out.  I know a lot will be added and updated.  But I'm not going to say it's a good game yet, just because of what it could be."

The developer hosts a community stream every Monday (sometimes Tuesdays, when things don't go to plan) and we talk about whatever. We discuss things within Black Ice, things going on with our lives, and more. +1 for interactive developer.The game is very detailed, maybe not visually, as it's mainly just low poly meshes and such, but the loot system and statistic area of the game is unbelievable. There are so many combinations, for every item there is bound to be 1,000,000 copies of that item, with different and unique stats.Multiplayer could be worked on, as sometimes it can get quite laggy, fps and internet wise.But overall, Black Ice is a fantastic game."

What can I say about this game?  For starters, it's a great game just to ♥♥♥♥ around in.  There's no story, no annoying dialogue or bad voice-overs, no character animations, no gun models, no buildings or invisible walls.  ""What's so great about that?"" you ask?  Well, it's this-- you ever want to kill a spider in your house with a laser but couldn't get your national Government to give you the funds to research and produce a laser that could kill that spider?  Have you ever thought a flying/hovering shark that flung fireballs at you would be a cool thing?  What about neon colored everything?Black Ice has all that and more.  Think the randomized gazillions of loot of Borderlands, the action-rpg feel of Diablo and the trippy neon-grid of TRON all had a three-some and somehow all gave birth at once to this game.  You go around hacking systems and killing off bots that appear to prevent you from stealing the precious data from those systems.  Wanna shoot rainbow stars at a giant Scorpion?  Go ahead!  Feel like throwing hammers from a machine gun?  You can find em.  How about Equipping nothing else but server hacking tools, laser and a couple of bots to help you fight and take on 5 different servers at a time?  Yes, you can do that.Pros:+ Graphics are beautiful and simple+ There's nothing really grindy about leveling up+ It's not really tedious, you can take on whatever server and how ever many you want at a time+ Loot is plentiful and never hard to come byCons:- Button configuration can get a little cluttered depending what you have equipped where- Store menu and inventory menu can be a little tricky to navigate and is probably more tedious than the actual game itselfRating: 207/7, would play cool Cyberpunk-esque game again and shoot spiders with lasers."
,Recommended,311800,14176665,"Posted: 26 January, 2015",all,Powersocke,"This game is a mix of bright, flashy colours, a ton of loot, a bunch of shooting and a whole lot of eye cancer. And this is why I like it. If you wanna skip the lengthy part of my review and wanna go straight to the pros and cons, you can find them below.Let's start, shall we?Although this is an early access game, I bought it. I rarely ever buy early access games and to be frank, it looked boring as hell on the screenshots. But after reading so many positive reviews and watching a video provided by the dev I wanted to try it for myself. So, what is it about?Well, you're a hacker and you move in a virtual city (you could probably guess from all the wireframe yourself). That city is full of corporations you gott hack in order to level up your mad skillz. Your ultimate goal is to hack the biggest company in town, Finality Corp. This is not only the biggest building but also the most difficult to hack. So your primary objective is to hack as many buildings as you can to level up, get stronger and ultimately face the big♥♥♥♥♥cybershark, the end boss and dangerous protection software of Finality Corp.So, how does the hacking work? You stand in front of a building and press either H or 1 on your keyboard (default controls). Then the hack will begin. Upon hacking enemies will spawn. The higher the skill level required to hack something, the longer the hack will take and the stronger the enemies will be. You get XP by successfully hacking a company's building and defeating the enemies. Be careful though, because as soon as the hack starts, you will be forced to move in a limited area of the hack. Leaving that area causes the hack to be cancelled.Upon successfully hacking a building, it will get transparent and you will get loot which you can incorporate into your software to get stronger. The loot that drops is based on your own level.  Also, better hacking devices mean better hacking, keep that in mind.What kind of loot is there?A lot. There is a whole bunch of weapons, from machine guns to shotguns, sniper rifles, ice blasts, fire balls, rainbowlasers, laser beam weapons, bombs and so on and so forth. It looks all pretty cool tbh. Then there are minions you can conjure to help you out, additional malware, so to speak. And also there are better hacking devices for you to pick up and a lot of other stuff. A lot of the items will give you passive bonuses on your stats and effectively boost your mad skillz.What can you do with all the loot you don't need? Visit a shop! In a shop, you can sell your unwanted loot for bitcreds and buy better items with bitcreds. But I gotta say, after an hour of playing you'll acquire so many bitcreds that you can buy almost anything in a shop which means the stuff could be a bit more balanced imo. Also, enemies do not drop loot, they only give XP.Speaking of enemies, what types of enemies are there?Well, there are a few. Stationary towers, a lot of moving enemies, little spiders, big boss spiders, enemies with and without cannons, shields and lasers, scorpions and the like. Looks pretty cool but the enemies lack a bit of variety, there aren't all that many in the game as it is right now.Luckily there is a ton of different weapons and skills to defeat them with. The only gripe I've got with it though is the fact that the game's got no weapons models which means you won't see your super cool laser cannon but that's okay I guess.The game's got other neat details though.For instance: When you walk up to a company's building you can look for its entrance door and click on it. This door will give you some info on the company you are about to hack and to be honest, it's humorous and I like it. You can also find that humour with a lot of items, for example the ""Ghost In The Shellfish""-minion or the ""Downloadable RAM""-upgrade. It's pretty nice and it made me smile more than once. Good job.From the technical side of things the game runs well without any performance issues. The only issue being that things can get extremely bright and you will get eye cancer after a few hours of playing. Also some very bright spots can prevent you from seeing the last enemy to defeat to end the hack.And what other game mechanics does this game have?Well, you can shoot, walk, run, sprint, jump, use a jetpack to fly, teleport a few meters away and most importantly: hack.But be careful, because everything you do will cost you RAM. You can increase your RAM by leveling up and assigning skill points or by items which give passive bonuses. A jetpack, for instance, needs to heat up which costs a bunch of RAM and the flying itself also costs a big bunch of RAM. And when you're completely out of RAM you cannot jump, fly or shoot or even hack. So keep an eye on your RAM meter.To wrap this up, what are the pros and cons of the game?+ Huge, open world with the option of an ever generating world, making the game endless+ Flashy and colourful visuals and nice reflections+ Big variety of weapons to choose from+ Cool soundtrack+ Great character stat customization and fast leveling up+ Great challenge with higher tier hacks+ A big bunch of cool upgrades for you to use+ Achievements to go after+ Nice humour and little details in the game as well as a couple of funny references+ Bunch of loot+ A nice dev+ Highly addictive gameplay- Lacking enemy variety- Danger of eye cancer (srsly, dat shizz is BRIGHT)- No visible weapon models- The amount of bitcreds you get is unproportional to the amount of useful things in the shops or: too much creds- Although the colours are nice, the game's look can get pretty monotonous- As soon as you approach Finality Corp. the boss will spawn so you can't hack anything near that building- The amount of possible songs playing during combat is a bit small- The uge world can get demotivating, even on the lowest setting- No story (can be a good thing or a bad thing, for me it is a con)And, finally, what I'd like to see in the game:* Fixing all the cons I just listed* To have your very own house or company in the world as a base of operations where you can store your inventory and which you can decorate and such* That hacked companies don't get transparent but instead get added to your company, changing colour rather than getting transparent* Optional colour filters for the game to change up the look a bit (for instance a filter that paints all the black squares rainbow-ish with flashing colours and the like)* A couple new game modes, for instance a survival mode or an arcade mode where you hack only one building but it takes longer with each level and such (or something that has something to do with music and flashing colours)* Visible and customizable player model when going to your inventory and/or your base of operations as mentioned above* You can equip two weapons at a time, would be cool if the right-click weapon was right and the left-click-weapon was left, I am currently shooting with two lasguns and it's kinda disappointing to only have one beam* Make the city more alive with visible data streams and little critters running around or even NPC players doing stuff, combine this with the idea of houses you can go in and the shops and such will get more awesomeI guess I could rant on and on of what kind of stuff I'd like to see in the game if I just thought about it hard enough but I guess I'll stop now.So, that's it.Would I recommend this game? Absolutely.At 10 bucks? You bet! It can get highly addictive and is a bunch of fun, even in this early state. There is a lot of room for improvement but the way I see it, the dev will sort that out."

Imagine Borderlands without the story mixed with Quake, in a tron universe. If you don't enjoy games revolved around grinding to get loot to grind for better loot, then this game isn't for you.I've played this game since the first release so I feel like I have a good grounding on the game.*These are subject to change as the game continues*Pros:- Beautiful game, which some of the screenshots on the game don't give justice.- Fluent gunplay, where you can shoot multiple weapons at once making for a colourful spectacle.- Fast gameplay akin to Quake- Tons of build variety with weapons, skill points and talents- Plenty of video options to customize for nostalgic purposes- Can sink tons of hours into it due to the high level cap- Achievements provide motivation to get as it is difficult to achieve.- Choice of LAN and Online- No major bugsMixed:- Slow patch release, however they are quite hefty and change a lot- The UI is inconsistent with clarity (shops show currency, but your inventory doesn't?)- Not many people playing on servers- Game doesn't feel extremely immersive/alive, but has improved a ton, and with the upcoming update will improve with roaming mobs.Cons:- Hard to tell when enemies hit you, and their attack range (applies to melee units)- Harder difficulties don't spawn new enemies, just harder versions of existing enemies- Cannot compare items with one another- Cannot see your character stats screen and how they're upgraded from items (similar to diablo 3 stat screen)The game is worth a look at, and I would recommend playing with a friend for even more fun. With every update the game seems to be improving in the right direction, and while it could still be awhile from the finished product it is worth supporting and playing right now."

It's quite a fun game and definitely worth having in your library.I know it's still in development and what not but sadly promises of new monsters, a plot and quests don't seem all that appealing. The game world as it stands really isn't robust enough to support engaging quests. A plot won't make me stronger and I really don't need new mobs to spawn if they are just going to intefere with the undending gear grind.I feel like there should just be more. Epic weapons is a horrible stopping point, What about legendary, mythic,artifact or even item sets? Doesn't even have to be like defined sets, gear could spawn with a random set prefix and wearing 2 or more could apply some small bonus.Why does my character stop getting points at level 50? I want to customize his/her growth aside from hoping for lucky drops from gear. What about a prestige system or something? Where maybe you can reset at some level and maintain some portion of your talents or the talent point cap for you new char is raised etc etc. Just something more than gear. Right now all you need is money and gear. Money buys gear but it's good for nothing else (except for maybe making you sad if you die and see millions of gold taken for dying). Maybe make additional talent points buyable with gold. Each point gets progressively more expensive?I don't know, I really enjoy this game. Can't wait to see what the dev puts together. Surely it will be great!"

76561197994131755,Recommended,311800,16610934,"Posted: 21 June, 2015",all,spectrefps,"Amazing game.Black Ice is a stunning cyberpunk/Tron style shooter with rpg elements. You jump into a procedurally generated ""city"" of servers (resemble buildings) and must hack them while defending yourself from the various enemies it spawns. Higher level servers will throw more and deadlier enemies at you, but will offer more experience and better rewards. As you level up, you earn point that you can spend on ""Talents"", which offer a variety of permanent passive bonuses (health, damage, rare loot chance, etc). There are also a myriad of procedurally generated weapons and assorted ""pets"" (AI drones) that you can summon to fight for you, each with various bonuses and strengths.For weapons, there is everything from basic shotguns and machine guns to railguns, beam cannons, disco balls, and TRON-style throwing discs (which return to you like a boomerang). Each of these procedurally generated wepaons can feature all sorts of properties, including drunk-flight, piercing, freeze, slow, burn, zigzag, richochet, explosion (area of effect), bounce, knockback, and more. Want an explosive rocket machinegun with bouncy shots that ""colorizes"" anything it hits? How about a railgun that pierces through ANYTHING ('buildings' included) that freezes enemies solid? THese and more are just a taste of some of the crazy weapons you will acquire.Visually, the game has a very Tron-style presentation, with intense neon lighting and a hewalthy amount of bloom. It makes for a visual festival while battling AI minions as they explode into a shower of lights and particles. I also find it easy to spot and track enemies due to the contrast provided by the ""neon wireframe"" graphics style.Audio seems to be retro styled, although I feel that this fits the game perfectly. Lasers and bolts have that distinctive ""pew pew"" to them, while wepaons with explosive properties leave a satisfying boom on impact. Also, the music is catchy, and I often find myself inadvertantly bobbing my head in rythm to the combat tracks. Also, if you find the 'miniboss'. the music shifts to a track that, in all honesty, gave me shivers the first time I heard it (before he obliterated me).This is a fantastic game that shows great promise. The developer has been making frequent updates, and also has a separate ""in development"" branch available (in Betas), with some significant changes to both gameplay and the overall interface (including rebinding all controls). I look forward to future updates and the eventual release of this gem."

Now I'm not saying this because:It has an incredible story, as there is no story (yet)It has groundbreaking visuals, as it doesntIt has interesting enemies, as the enemies are kind of blandBut because of how insanely entertaining the game is. The visuals of the game, while simple and minimal, they are striking. The game is littered with beautiful neon skylines and an ominous white skyscraper taunting you to hack it.The game itself is one big grindfest but there's something about fighting neon invertabrates with ♥♥♥♥ing lasers that keeps me coming back for more. Not only this but the dev is one of the most active for an early access I've ever seen. It's a beautiful game and while it has no story and the enemies get irrelevant after a while because you've seen a metric ♥♥♥♥ ton of each, it's stil growing. The game isn't finished and I love it. I can only imagine the places this game can go, because there's just so much that can be added. Some people may say $14.99 is a steep price, but it goes to help the dev make this game even greater.

,Recommended,311800,25345538,"Posted: 4 September, 2016",all,Brispir,"I really like this game. It's very colorful, with a cyberpunk theme to it, very beautiful to look at. Feels like you're really doing a lot of ""hacking,"" the way they do it in the movies. The buildings have variety and also reset every time you load up the game, so don't worry about running out of them (though what happens when they are all cleared?)  Also, as you die, the color drains out and becomes gray until you regain health (a nice touch). The graphics are very simplistic looking, but for this game, it works well.The game is simple enough. Pick a server, hack it, kill the bad guys that show up to defend it, collect loot, repeat. Sounds simple and repititious, but there is lot of loot to collect, and you always need to get stronger equipment as you level up, and always that next challenge to take on. The servers have levels starting with 1 and going up to 100 (I think). Higher levels yield stronger enemies and stronger loot, so you can go at your own pace. Also, there are a lot of weapons such as laser beams, freeze beams, flying discs, mines, bouncy balls, and various others.I also love that you can play the game within 5 seconds of loading up the game, without having to wait for all these other logos and disclaimers being shown first. I also noticed the dev is always taking suggestions and improving the game as much as possible. The dev is always adding new content and new ideas to make the game more interesting. I'm starting to regret buying this game on sale now, instead of paying full price for it. It's definitely worth the full price.Don't play if you're looking for a story (there isn't one, from what I can tell, but I don't think the game needs one) or if you're looking for a ""Call of Battlefield"" type game. Supposedly the game has PVP but I never tried it, and don't know if anyone else plays online. However, this game satisfies what I was looking for when I want to just hop onto a game and shoot some things.

This game is basically Borderlands and Tron put into a blender with a dash of classical Cyberpunk aesthetic. The entirety of the game’s world is a neon landscape of corporate servers represented as geometric structures which you hack for loot and experience. However, those who aren’t fond of grinding could find themselves getting bored quite fast. I expect that more gameplay and story content will arrive in future updates."

Garrett is a class act, have no fear of future updates. At this very moment he is collaborating and working on adding new, beautifully modeled, mobs among many other things. Hopefully a new trailer for the game as well;)IMO it doesn't fully reflect the games current greatness.Also, I played completely solo (;_;o god).Crank up the awesome soundtrack, or your favourite 80s synth tracks; run around and hack servers, frantically kill mobs, level up stats, pick up loot;repeat.As of right now it is very simple, that being a pro to start but a potential con as you pass one playthrough.Currently without a storyline or quests(coming soon™), the obvious goal is to dominate all the servers. Working your way up to the gigantic looming server sitting atop the landscape. There is a smorgasbord of loot to look forward too. Weapons, mods, abilities, and minions; with endless variations. Use them to destroy the increasingly difficult, and varied, mobs. 15 hours in, and counting, I still haven't found certain weapon types!Although there are a lot of weapons that have the potential to change your combat strategy, I found myself in a constant state of reverse circle strafing and jumping around in the largely unchanging, server laden, environment. Perhaps being transported to a randomly occurring dynamic arena, upon hacking a server, would help spice things up? Regardless, I enjoy the frantic combat as it is.(Pro-Tip: Properly caffeinate yourself before playing 0_0 )The visuals… oh man. I’m absolutely partial to the bright tron looks and colourful FX. Do yourself a favour and shoot a bouncy-ball shotgun (you read that right) into a tight corridor with a bunch of enemies. Talk about mesmerizing.I could write an essay and break down every aspect of Black Ice out of pure fanfare, but you should just try out the fully featured demo for yourself.It's no secret I found something in this game that I havn't found in any other. Maybe it's the promise of more content over the horizon, or the fact I've fallen in love with the retro sound & style of the 80's, who knows. Maybe you will find a stirring revelation in Black Ice as well.*TLDR*Having searched Steam high and low everyday for weeks, buying and refunding games (25+), not finding satisfaction anywhere; I figured out that what I needed was a simple, inspiring, rewarding, full out action-packed experience...Hello Black Ice."

It's a FPS hacking game, I mean that on its face is a winner.You run around to servers like a badass and start hacking. As you're hacking, you get attacked by the server's defense mechanisms, which tend to take the form of nasty scorpions and other monsters that I can't really compare to anything else except maybe stuff you'd see under a microscope.To slay such awful creatures and complete your hack, you build an arsenal of weapons, mods, skills, perks, etc. I really love the fact you can get programs to summon minions to help you fight. One is an 'aim bot'. How cool is that?The weapons are kinda diablo-esque in that they are fairly random in stats and rarity and are dropped once you hack a server. Some weapons shoot rainbows, but not the innocent happy kind, the kind that kills monsters. You have variations on sniper weapons, shotguns, discs, balls, etc. so there is a good variety. What you don't want you can sell to shops. Sometimes I hack the shops themselves and take their stuff, so that's an option.The graphics are just so fitting and so is the music. Really pulls you in and overall is so much fun to play. Highly recommend it!"

Ok.So. As a demo, you'd expect the paid game to be better, right? More enemies? More weapons? More diverse gameplay?Well, what you saw in the demo is the entirety of the paid game. You fight the same enemies with the same weapons hacking srevers that all look and act the same. 4+ hours into this game, and there is nothing there that wasn't in the demo.You do the same thing. Hitting 1 on a server and killing all the enemies? That's the game. Nothing more, just hacking (pressing a button on) servers and killing the enemies that spawn. So as far as gameplay goes, nothing ever changes.The enemies stay the same. As you take on higher-level servers the enemies get beefier, sure. But as your level increases, you get exactly as beefy! Because of this, the difficulty never really changes.Everything looks the same. That place you plopped out to start with? Hope you like it. The game is just those same servers copy-pasted with a slightly higher level the further you go.As of NOW, in this game's Early Access state, there quite frankly is nothing the $15.00 game can offer that the free Demo doesn't.

(You still gain health and energy with each level but no talent points)-Some of the talents don't seem as useful as others-No way to reset perk points without starting a new character-For achievement hunters: some of the achievements are no longer possible to finish in the current version, however you can play the older version to get them. You just have to start a new character.Overall I give this game a 7/10. There just doesn't feel like there is much purpose yet beyond loot grinding without the upcoming quest system.

I bought this late 2014 and have seen it go through so many changes via patches and bug fixes. I even talked to the developer once to give my thoughts. Now, playing it again, I can see it has come far.Black ice is an FPS set in a cyber world where you hack buildings which spawn enemies when hacked. Loot is dropped randomly, ranging from common to epic and unique loot. These can range from mods you equip to gain passive stats, to weapons, to spawning your own minions, to constant heals/reusable instant heals, and actions like jumping, teleporting, and sprinting. Additionally, there is a level and perk system each time one levels up, with the latter gaining one point every ten levels. You can upgrade the former with additions to HP, RAM (think MP that regenerates), ATK and other attributes.The enemies have intelligent A.I.: melees will attempt to flank you while ranged will shoot and run.While playing, I found great enjoyment out of grinding for equipment that fit my playstyle and gave excellent passive strats.

Also, it would be nice if the game provided detailed information about each skill, because I did have to go on the Wiki for two of them.

Although development has been slow I'm certain things will pick up soon with the formation of a company bakcing the game now.The developer Garret Cooper is very responsive to the community and listens to feedback and suggestions so get involved!Anyways, endorsements aside...Black Ice is a rather addictive first person shooter set in the retro-futuristic cyberspace everyone dreamed of in 1990. It's ice or be iced baby and getting iced ain't cool!The gameplay is open ended and grindy with no real direction other than ""hack servers and destroy the Black Ice"".I guess the one true goal is to hack Finality Incorporated which starts out at LVL100. A pretty intimidating goal that gets closer as you level and grind. Everything is blanced and well rounded with the pace of the game ultimately being decided by YOU, the player.The world consists of wireframes and grids that are occasionaly broken up by the jagged landscape that dips and climbs above the otherwise level plain. The ""servers"" that are littered throughout the netscape are the only major deviations from the rolling plains other than the aforementioned hills. Servers are geometric buildings that dot the land farther than the eye can see (well maybe as far as your render distance is set).Hacking servers is pretty simple. You equip your icebreaker to your hotbar and activate it by either pressing the button assigned to the slot you put it in or the quick deploy button (Q). Once you activate your icebreaker on a server a circular area will appear that you have to stay inside for a short amount of time (determined by your icebreaker's stats and your character's skils) until the server is hacked. Enemies will spawn while you are hacking and you must eliminate all of them to complete the hack. The higher a server's level the harder the enemies and the better the rerwards.Once hacked, a server will drop some sweet loot and net you a good chunk of XP. As for the loot that isn't so sweet, you can just huck that junk to a vendor to earn some bitcreds. Once you've got some bitcreds you can buy better gear from the various stores littered about, which are identifiable by a giant $ floating over their server along with the obscenely solid neon colors.The multiplayer is there but I hardly ever bother with it due to the lack of interactivity between players. You get no reward for assisting them and the community is rather silent in person. There honestly isn't much to do with other players. Although it is nice to see the ocasional Pacman ghost float by on a mass murder spree.All in all I love the game. I love every little thing that has changed or that has been added in.I hope to see the hardwork continue on this gem of a game!"

There are also shops where you can buy and sell items.Criticism in general terms-) this will always be early access is seems-) not difficult, nor competitive, nor extremely skill based-) not worth current price-) boring, after about 30 minutes you know what the next 30 hours will be about (if you continue to play)-) the art style is interesting for a few minutes, but then I just find it annoying tbh-) far too rudimentary (in features, gameplay, items, et cetera)Detailed criticismEnemies far too weak and too many ; range limit while hacking annoying (due to many enemies, some of your own bots and other buildings standing around, free movement very limited) ; claims to be fast paced, it isn't ; item drops not interesting enough ; basic gameplay too rudimentary ; should be greater value placed onto accuracy (for example some enemies could have a weak spot, some sort of damage model, et cetera) ; hw requirements seem too high for how it looks (probably inefficient coding) ; ...--------- Conclusion ---------If it was a free to play browser game I would be more positive towards it, but it's not. The idea in itself is nice (though already done thousands of times): mixture of shooter + rpg, modify your own abilities, item drops, some cash, stores, and a level-up system, if that alone is enough to grasp your attention and maybe keep you playing, go ahead (if it's on sale).If however good gameplay and some variety are not merely features for you but rather the basis for any possible enjoyment, then I can't recommend this one.

Even the final objective is just another server that has an easily defeated or even completely adoidable enemy trying (very poorly) to guard it before it becomes just another, slightly stronger server to attack. The multiplayer leaves a lot to be desired, and not much can be gained from player interaction.
