It runs well on modern OS. I have had little to no frame loss or crashing.I am enjoying it but I played it when I was young. If you buy it please note that it has oldschool UI jank.It does hold up and run well however.heres a screen shot of the options menuhttp://imgur.com/iNUBw4II recomend it if you played it back in the day. Its still way better then Wildlife park 2."

The problem is there are serious graphical glitches that render the game unplayable in any mode other than windowed at the lowest resolution. It's difficult to see things and read the text at that size, and it's annoying that I can't play fullscreen."

I was happy to see that it came out to Steam as my laptop has no CD driver I couldn't play the game anymore, and even better, it has achievements. The only problem is that the Steam version has graphical glitches (the cursor keeps vibrating for me, and the resolution settings is also weird), I hope that this will be fixed. I recommend the game for anyone who enjoys zoo simulators and is not being afraid to try something ""retro"", I still think that Wildlife Park (and NOT Wildlife Park 2 or 3 or any of the Zoo Tycoon games) is the best in its genre."

Old-school type gameplay and old-school graphics but it works really well. When you start out you might want to pay attention to the tutorial because it is difficult to understand some of the animal♥♥♥♥♥♥without it"

76561198360301293,Not Recommended,311840,31596302,Posted: 6 May,all,StrixNebulosa,"I bought this game hoping it would be like Zoo Tycoon, and in a sense it is. However it is much less customizable than Zoo Tycoon, which is disappointing. You can't decide on what colors or theme you want your park to have, or how really how you want the exhibits to look. Everything is pretty much dictated for you, there is not a lot of customization. It is also not very user friendly. It is hard to tell exactly what the animals and customers need to be happy, and I have trouble knowing where everything is without labels. Additionally, I cannot run this game except on the lowest graphics setting, which makes it much less enjoyable. The baby penguins look like walking, uncooked chicken nuggets. Overall I would not recommend this game. It's a waste of money in my opinion."

76561198035670136,Not Recommended,311840,26186635,"Posted: 23 October, 2016",all,xebecatt2002,"I brought this game as I'm a fan of similar titles like Zoo Tycoon and heard good reviews about this. However I didn't see the negative reviews which highlight the major flaw with this game, that you can only play in a window and cannot change the resolution.There is no full screen mode. If you try and make it full screen using the options menu the game still runs in a window, cutting off the text and tool bars making it impossible to progress especially if you are playing the tutorial. I managed to progress a little using the defult small window display though it was increadible hard to read the text and make out what was happening on the scree due to the small size.Hopefully this issue will be fixed but intill then I would not recommend purchasing this game."

,Not Recommended,311840,34061999,Posted: 6 August,all,CX Music,I played Wildlife Park when i was a kid. And it was great.So i found it randomly on Steam and buyed it. When igot into the game ... well: It runs terrible on Windows 10.- buggy fullscreen- cursor flickers- UI barely readable- glitchesSadly i had to refund it. I hope the devs can fix this.I mean you're paying about 7$ and for that a gamemust work fine.

I can't advance in the campaign unless I beat them and there are no walkthroughs online.I would be more then happy to change my review if someone can answer some questions for me.1. How would you suggest I play the panda breeding program?I have tried focusing on just the pandas so they will breed and made them a cool home. But then the customers don't like my park and I go bankrupt. If I focus a little on each the panda home isn't suitable enough to breed, but the people are happy, and I'm still not making money. If I try just other animals to make the zoo popular. I just can't make enough money to adopt two panda's so I'm just stuck.2. How do you make a killer whale home stay?I can do the shark and the bottle nose dolphin. If I can figure out the Whale then I can pass the board.Anyway yeah. Thumbs down."

,Recommended,311840,30734343,Posted: 25 March,all,Princess Milky,"Aside from some of the graphical errors of playing a dated game on a more recent computer, it's still really fun.Sure, there are some annoyin things I had to do to get it to stop doing stupid stuff like a flashing cursor, however this is a gem of a game even to this day. The simplicity and even challenges at time are what make it a really good game I think. The addition of achievments is a nice touch I think too."

I had this game years ago on a disk, and the hours I put into it...Well worth it in my opinion.

For a normal game, it is not that bad, but compared to Zoo Tycoon 2 it just can't fulfill my needs. I am not able to play Zoo Tycoon 2 at the moment because I don't have a PC yet, so i got this to hopefully hold me off from it, but it just can't. If Wildlife Park 2 were to come out for Mac, I would for sure buy it, but this one just doesn't impress me much."
