If u want a really good  challenge you can play hard mode and your game will be longer than 7 hours. Some fight are really hard and others are really easy. Its always full of humor. There is alot of stuff to find and hidden treasures. It will not be easy for most players to reach 100% and find everything because there is alot of maps and alot of stuff to break.I would give it a 4 out of 5If u aren't sure about buying it than try out the Demo version  :)Sorry if my english was bad  and i hope you will enjoy this gameMelovia
,Recommended,311870,11402651,"Posted: 25 July, 2014",all,[G@mer]But terd,"It's a first try on Super Trench Attack!The video can be found here:http://youtu.be/g5IngtPw34MAs far as I've read, this is a one-man development, which is impressive in and of itself, but that is not the only thing this game has to offer.Starting with the options menu, I'd like to point out that the game has no rebindable keys, but this is not bad in that case since the default layout handles very well. Left-handed people might now feel excluded, but there is no need for alarm, since you can chose a layout especially for left-handed people in mind.There are no resolution options, but you can choose between commonly used aspect ratios. What is really nice is that the tooltip as well as the icon shows you what kind of display device uses that aspect ratio.Audiowise you have seperate sliders for sfx and music and you can toggle certain ui elements on or off.As we go into the game we start of with cutscenes that introduce us into the story and it shows its humor as well. With that said, if you play the game, take your time, watch the scenes and read the dialogue. It is worth a laugh or two.After showing you movement and shooting and the different UI elements, the game sets you free into the wilds.Having played until the first boss, I can't think of any line of sight of hitbox issues so far. It only happened one or two times that I had a hard time figuring out whether or not I can walk around freely, because of height differences that weren't completely transparent to me. Other than that I had no troubles at all with the gameplay mechanics of the twitch shooter part or the shooting gallaries, which appear from time to time.If you want to go off the beaten path, feel free to do just that as the game gives you a lot of options and sometimes rewards you with collectables.Not only can you engage in combat with the enemy, but you can play around back the camp as well.(But watch out for the casino...you might loose all your gold there)So far I had a lot of fun, the only complaint I might make is that the game is quite easy, since there are no visible penalties for dying apart from losing a bit of time and having counted one death towards your stats. But since there are leaderboards available there might be some people out there that are competitive enough to try not to die once in a playthrough.With that said we come to the tl:dr... Is the game worth it?As I've said in the video, there are way worse investments for 5€ than this game.The only people I cannot recommend this game to are people that can't tolerate 16/32 bit graphics or the 80s-movie humor that is widespread across the game.Everyone else though I can recommend this game wholeheartedly."

,Recommended,311870,20822138,"Posted: 29 January, 2016",all,Whiteswart,"Little top-down-view ""ala 8bit"" shooter game with cartoon animation. Yep, another one. Thank God, at least there are no zombies in that game, unlike many of her sisters!Pro part:Game's short, easy to beat on gold with achievements, the price is not high even without discounts Steam so rich for. If you've seen the video from the store page, you've seen all that that game have for you. Shoot it if you're not up to some bigger hits for a moment, and just want to make some clicks with your mouse and get some achievements for it. Easy breeze of victory, you know?Contra:First of all, the setting with nemesis in the form of some ""blackcross"" army, looking that much alike as in the Metal Slug series, and all ""retro"" and ""WW1"" stylizations are pretty weak and over-the-top stereotyped. Almost just like as the zombie pattern... But that unattractiveness of visual stylistic might be just mine niggle.That is really troubling is constant crushes of the game - the usual symptom of bad code. While the game is not big, and can be completed in maybe less than 5-7 hours, by that time I have witnessed maybe 10-15 crushes, and each time I was losing some of the game progress, having to start it over and over.Finally, the controls. They are simple, yet they are usually make you feel clumsy. Were that game a bullethell of sort, with the need to dodge many bullets at the time, many people would have been irritated with the controls...But it is not a bullethell type of game. It is just a short and easy shooter everyone can play and get precious ""Gold"" with achievements. So yeah, I recommend that game - especially if you see it in some bundle or with big discount - but only to raise your numbers on Steam. As of cultural value... this given game is quite forgetful, nurturing on the soil of other successful projects like Metal Slug. My rating will be 6/10: acceptable, but not giving neither the real challenge, nor the grasp of fresh air that we're expecting from indie projects. A product, not the art piece."
,Recommended,311870,18956170,"Posted: 8 November, 2015",all,Great Cold Wombat of the Earth,"This was a rather good little use of a Saturday afternoon. The closest genre would be one of those old nintendo/sega RPGs like Legend of Zelda with shooting. You have your weapons you upgrade as you progress, items that'll give you bonuses, and you'll level up your health/weapon damage/etc.The gameplay doesn't get stale thanks to the 6-7 hour length. The World War I setting / humor is what really separates this from other similar games. I don't think this would've been as enjoyable if it was set elsewhere but I loved it regardless. It's pretty easy to 100% the achievements as well.My only gripe is that I wish it went further in terms of scope / variety and I was hoping the sequel that came out recently stayed in this style, but that's turn-based.In the end the price of $5 is fully justified and I'm really glad I played this."

,Recommended,311870,20463696,"Posted: 10 January, 2016",all,Hairbautt,"Super Trench Attack! (STA) is a surprisingly fun-filled game to play. My first impression was set pretty low but I was pleasantly surprised within the first few minutes of gameplay at how much fun I was having. The game is primarily a isometric or top-down shooter that features elements from role-playing games with different shops, upgrades and skills. It's also hilarious in its presentation offering slapstick humor and tongue-in-cheek dialogue. STA is certainly a hidden gem among the Steam store and any fans of isometric shooters should rally to support the title."
,Not Recommended,311870,19135199,"Posted: 17 November, 2015",all,Shaft,"""Super Trench Attack"" is one game that looks way better on paper than it is in reality.Looking at the screenshots, descriptions and the positive reviews, one would get the idea this was a short but sweet, goofy, quirky isometric RPG shooter with humor. Yeah, well, the truth is a bit different...The stills can't reveal the stiff and ugly animations. They can't reveal the annoyingly clunky movement. They don't reveal the utterly inane shooting mechanics. And the humor... don't even get me started! The game is chock-full of ""jokes"" - only to call them jokes is an insult to comedy. You can't call the game's ""humor"" as good or bad, because that isn't really humor. The ""jokes"" are statements, plain and simple, which aren't witty, or funny.Like:Your Commander: We have to kill the enemy Admiral.You: (I hope she isn't looking at me!)orWeapons Shop Guy: These guns are all great.You: (Yeah, you wish...)And so on, and so on, and so on... those old generic jokes our grandfathers used to tell are funnier than this atrocity with which you'll be constantly bombarded throughout the game. As if that weren't enough, the game is riddled with grammatical errors. There's at least 1 or 2 punctuation marks missing in every text balloon. Perhaps someone will not mind this at all, but the fact that the game was released in such a state really shows the developers are either fairly illiterate, or that they simply don't care. Or both.""STA!"" isn't expensive, but I'd never pay full price for it. Even at a huge 80% discount, I still don't think it was worth the money... So, no, I can't recommend it at all. Perhaps, if someday it's featured in the $1 tier of Humble Bundle, then yeah, otherwise skip it."
,Recommended,311870,15169995,"Posted: 2 April, 2015",all,Evaheist,"This game is alright. The humor isn't cringe worthy and I actually got a few chuckles out of it. It plays like an isometric shooter where you move with keyboard and aim/shoot/reload with the mouse. A few levels are made like shooting galleries (like Virtua Cop). They are the trickiest to finish especially the final one where you barely get a chance to reload.There are mild RPG elements but they are pretty rudimentary. I upgraded my casual pistol so much that my rifle wasn't useful anymore so I pretty much finished the game with a revolver and this got boring pretty fast. There are only the revolver and rifle weapons plus grenades and booby traps (not useful at all).The story is bare-bones and I'm kinda glad it is because I couldn't really see it going far in that territory from the get-go.  Anyway, the game isn't challenging really and the whole challenge comes from some cheap boss fights that take hundreds of hits before finally going down. On the whole, it is a pretty functional game and there are a few distractions here and there to prolonge the 4-5 hours lifespan.Super Trench Attack is a practice in patience. It MAY prove mildly enjoyable as a time passer and it PROBABLY is worth getting on a super cheap sale but you can pretty much pass this one up without feeling any kind of gaping void in your life.Thumbs up by a slight margin."

The game doesn't take itself too serious and is always trying to make you crack a smile.I bought it for 2,49€ and it's worth it to kill an afternoon or a some hours on a rainy day.

,Recommended,311870,34372225,Posted: 20 August,all,zetef,"This is great game to play in one sitting.(though is a bit repetitive) The story is set in a war.(no spoilers) The gameplay reminds me of point and click game, but is not one, where you move your character by the keyboard and control yoour camera by your mouse. The weakest points of the enemy are the head or the legs. Some enemies need to be shot in the legs because they might have a shield, Others are easily killed by grenades. I claim that some missions are frustrating and can cost you 3-5 deaths.(or is just me) I like the first person mode where you have a limited amount of ammo (when you run out of ammo you can reload) and have to shoot the character that pops up randomly on the screen hiding from you. This mode is used mainly for bosses. The fact that you can interact with the world to be in your advantage or disadvantage is a big plus, but this only appears in the final boss. The playtime you can get maximum collecting all the secrets and furniture is around 4-5h and the story is 3h.The comedy can get you most of the time, The music is what you would expect from a war game. High notes that are in tone with bravery. The bad thing is that the music loops itself after 15-20 seconds and there aren't more then 7-8 soundtracks.A nice experience.Story: Generic. 6/10Gameplay: Fun.

(You can easily be moving in one direction, and shoot in another direction on the screen. Click on what you want to shoot, and as long as you had a straight line-of-sight, you would hit it.) This type of aiming seems rare in games, but has a natural feel. (The game also supports a controller, but I have not tried that.) Unlimited grenades can also help at times (but be careful about blowing yourself up; I've jumped on my own grenade accidentally a few times). Early on, you also gain an ally which follows you around to help shoot the enemy. Both you and your ally level up, and you can improve some of your own stats at each level up. Your camp, the safe zone, allows you to buy upgrades such as weapons and armor. Multiple ""secret"" tunnel entrances allow you to jump to parts of the levels you're already reached in the current or previous play session. I like that there is no real penalty for death (and there are even a few cutscenes you won't see otherwise), except starting from base camp. (But with the previously mentioned tunnels, it usually does not take long to return to your previous location.)others' potential dislikeThe graphics are a low-resolution. If you need good graphics, look elsewhere. The screenshots with the smaller people are the playing graphics. (The large people are cutscenes.)my dislikesA few things such as game mechanics could use a little more explanation. There are only a few pre-defined key layouts. (However, the default should work for most people: most of the game is just moving WASD, shooting with mouse 1, reloading with mouse 2, and grenade throwing with mouse 3.)disclaimerI purchased this game normally, but also later received a free copy of this game for helping a bit with a test release. The game author did not ask me explicitly or implicitly for a review. The game author also did not threaten to reveal my heart-covered boxer shorts if I gave a bad review."

The amount of detail and love put into the worlds is awesome, one of my favorite examples being that in lot's of places you'll see the same cute dog getting into funny little situations. The combat is fun and exploring the world while on missions is cool too. My only real problems with this game are the technical ones, being that you can't change resolution and that whenever I tried to select the ""16-bit"" or ""blurred"" options my game would crash, so I played with default settings through and through. It all looked nice and fine, but seeing some diversity would have been interesting. Now besides these technical problems, everything else is very fun. Definitely worth the money."

The game feels pretty good to play.http://youtu.be/uu_8wT6n5RUPersonally I feel a little bit impressed with how much there is to the game. Playing it reminded me a bit of Diablo 2 of all things. Enemies and breakable containers drop loot which you can sell at a vendor so that you can afford better gear and you gain level's which you enables you upgrade your stats. After watching the trailer and screen shot’s I was expecting running and gunning not an RPG experience, so it was surprising for me. Learning to play the game was quick and easy to pick up. I like the fact that you can actually get shot's and stuff even though it is a 2D game. It also reminds of metal slug, it's sort of like a WW1 isometric version of that. As you can probably see from the trailer screenshot the game is very silly. There were some good bit's, it should at least occasionally get a laugh from you.Overall the game look's good. But I do think they overdid the silliness sometimes. But it's not really a problem. Some of the stuff was pretty amusing.So, yes I recommend checking out this game.

There are many secrets and collectibles to find, and there are numerous hidden setpieces that add flavor to the game world.-In contrast to most shooters these days, the AI partner is actually pretty good. The one drawback is that he has paperdoll endurance most of the time.-Knife wielding monkeys. What more needs to be said?-The final boss is surprisingly challenging and satisfying.Cons:-Kinda short, but for a five dollar game, its a decent length.-The aiming can be a bit dodgy at times.-The fact that you have an infinite amount of explosives KINDA ends up trivializing most boss fights.-In contrast to the satisfying final boss, the final area is a bit of a slog with dense clusters of enemies that can easily mow you down if you're not constantly on the move and spanning explosives.-The ammo system leaves a lot to be desired. Ammo drops from enemies and containers are extremely rare, and the shop only cares two ammo pickups at a time, and sometimes they're only for one weapon. And based on what I saw, the store only restocks once you've completed a mission.Overall: 7/10.

Unfortunately, the game is very easy and offers little to no challenge on normal difficulty. It holds your hand the entire time, and when you die, the enemies you've killed do not get reset. Nontheless, the combat is still fun and can offer slight challenge on occasion with boss battles and the occasional on rails shooting gallery where the enemies DO respawn if you die.

76561198015050226,Recommended,311870,14260311,"Posted: 31 January, 2015",all,cinedine,"A game like fast food – satisfying while playing but lacks depth in the long run.The game is either a very shallow Action RPG with shooting mechanics or a simple Iso-Shooter with mild RPG mechanics. It's this missing focus which lets the game suffer a bit.The shooting part is basically reduced to clicking on the enemy and occasionally throwing a grenade or placing a decoy or mine. As simple as that is, it also features limited ammo, reloading, line of fire and hit zones. The later are key to defeat some of the enemies like shield bearers or helmeted machine gunners, which is all the strategy there is.The RPG part features some character stats, level ups and an inventory and item system and loot drops. But none of these really shine. XP gains are mostly hidden and level ups only unlock new stuff at the shops and grant you some points to marginally improve your character, the loot is mainly gold, health/ammo if you're low on either and every so often a piece of equipment which is always outshone by vendor items. New weapons – the only way to improve your damage output – are even vendor only. There are also some uninspired passive skills like +DMG for your knife attack, +HP gain from health items or -DMG from explosions, but they're all acquired by buying them.A peeve of mine are shooting gallery passages which often take place as a boss fight and dumb down the game just this little bit more.The art style fits the humour perfectly. The comic look allows for situations like NPCs dressing up as a giant monkey or hanging from the flag pole on their shorts without feeling out of place or awkward. If this level of childish goofiness is not your thing, though, you'll have a hard time making it through the game because it's virtually around every corner. The game is also enticing enough to make you forget the pixelated look, although the stills and cut scenes would benefit from a higher detail and less crudeness.The world is rather small and the game fairly short. In 5h you should be through and have seen everything there is, found every hidden place and every collectible. Which is a shame, because even with all its faults the game is very enjoyable. On the other hand this enjoyment might come through the fast pace and its shortness.Just like fast food."

I can say that I think that is well worth the price. This is the kinda game you play on a rainy weekend and enjoy yourself with but will probably never come back to. Its a fun little dungeon crawler with a ww1 paint on it and a great since of humor. It has a very British kind of money python cartoon kind of vibe to it. It has a lot of great personality and is simple enough for pretty much anyone to pick up and play. The only real complaint I have is that I can’t see it having much replay value and I feel like this game would be amazing if it was given a co-op option and maybe a class system cause I there is not a lot of Varity to what you can do with your character atm.

This is actually a really fun game and although I wouldnt pay $5, its an absolute steal while on sale. Put in 6 hours playing casually and exploring and havent hit the end, plus the RPG element allows your own play-style.Helmets off to the Devs"

Now this personally this could just me since im new and don't have such a trigger-happy attitude for the fighting. also, its actually pretty difficult to get the gold in order to pay for ammo, grenades, med packs, decoys, or even new guns. I would say though if you got skill, this is a good game and you should get it, but if your a little slow on clickin for shootin, be careful... =P enjoy"

It's worth every penny if you're into some light hearted sillyness combined with WW1 style army stuff and a retro feel!! 10/10 would play again.
