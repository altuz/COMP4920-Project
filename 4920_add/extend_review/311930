It's a beautiful, refreshing take on the genre and it's pretty addictive, even when you die about 100x in a row while people watch your suffering on twitch.  Can't wait for the rest of the worlds!"

Controls are easy. levels are good looking.Update 327 hours later: Still playing Tinerita.  As of right now 62/66 #1 high scores for SpeedRuns. Haven't even started trying to match all the rocket pars. Haven't tried beating BOSS RUSH mode yet. Haven't completed all the SpeedRun modes. Still so much more to do.

You cannot jump, only rocket-jump; and it is incredibly hard. (Okay, not INCREDIBLY hard, but it is certainly difficult, and as much as you may rage in several levels, the feeling when you finally beat it is awesome.)Even in the earliest public release, for $15 you certainly get your money's worth even if you aren't the biggest fan of platformers.TL;DR: Tinertia is awesome, buy it"

The rocket jump controls are easy to pick up, but tricky to master. Once you get the hang of the controls, there is nothing more satisfying the doing a ""Speed-Run"" and beating all your friends best times. Check out Twitch & YouTube for some great gameplay videos. Definitely a fun game with excellent graphics. Absolutely worth the money!I got to watch some great footage of Tinertia at PAX East at the Twitch booth. This game is an absolute must-have if you love challenging platformers like Super Meat Boy."
,Recommended,311930,20787458,"Posted: 27 January, 2016",all,Bubblegum Witch,"Tinertia is a Quake meets Super Meat Boy 2.5D precision platformer with short levels in which you will die repeatedly and a sky high skill ceiling. Almost everything about it is fantastic from the deep movement mechanics to the clever level design, pleasant aesthetics, and music that does a great job of keeping you engrossed as you're replaying the same levels again and again. It's brilliant. This is one of the best games in my sizable Steam library and one of the few that I can actually recommend picking up at full price.Even once you've managed to get through the levels, which past the first world is quite a task in its own right, there's secondary goals to finish within a certain amount of time / rockets used (thankfully both don't have to be done on the same run) which add a great deal of replayability, and you can compete against other players' best runs with both friend and global leaderboards. The variety of gimmicks is great too, you aren't just running through the same design tropes world after world. It's not for the faint of heart, but if you're into repeating an area until you get every movement exactly right ala Super Meat Boy or Hotline Miami then this is going to be a perfect fit for your collection.I do have a few issues with the game but they're all fairly minor. Menu navigation is clunky unless you're using a controller (inexplicably, since this was originally designed for keyboard and mouse). Antialiasing is FXAA only and it definitely reduces the aesthetic quality of the game, though it still looks very nice overall. You can supersample it if you have the GPU power without breaking anything in the game, but that shouldn't be the only option for proper AA. Vsync causes massive performance problems, though in a game like this I'm not sure why you'd be using it anyway. It's recommended using driver forced vsync rather than the in game option but I haven't actually tried this to see if it works any better. Other than that, the graphics options given are respectable, offering you the ability to turn on or off ambient occlusion occlusion and depth of field, as well as a generic 'quality' selector which gives you six options from 'lowest' to 'ultra' (points for granularity). It's never specifically stated what each of these different qualities entails, but since the game's rendering adjusts in real time as you change it, you can pretty well see what happens by looking in the background of the menu. Even on lowest, the game still looks quite nice, and my GTX 760 keeps up with ultra just fine, no glaring performance issues outside of the mentioned problem with vsync.I think the progression system could be improved. The game is strictly linear and doesn't give you any way to bypass a level if you get stuck on a particularly tough one. A mouse sensitivity slider would be a welcome addition, as would the option to rebind keys which is completely absent for both keyboard / mouse and gamepad. And the current gamepad setup makes pulling off advanced jumping techniques that require rapidly firing off a series of rockets almost impossible. Tinertia really needs an alternate control scheme allowing you to aim with right stick and fire rockets with the trigger button, rather than having them fire on movement of the right stick, as is currently the only option. This would facilitate much more precise control and closer parity to playing with a mouse. Gamepad may never be the first choice for serious players, but that doesn't that it shouldn't be the best experience it could possibly be for those who want to use it.Overall, though, I can't praise this game enough. It's highly polished and just feels great to play. You can definitely tell that there was a lot of love that went into this project, and I hope that they will have a chance to make a sequel or campaign DLC. I'm surprised that it isn't getting more hype than I've seen thus far, especially as one of the rare early access projects that hasn't turned into a grand disappointment. If you're at all into speedrunning or enjoy challenging platformers, Tinertia is a must have."
,Recommended,311930,20282234,"Posted: 3 January, 2016",all,¤ leopluridon ☼,"Really fun platformer. Using rockets to jump/boost you through the level forces your brain to adjust to the non-traditional movement mechanics. Because of this, it can be rather challenging, but not in a frustrating way.Each level has different properties that force you to adapt what you learned in previous levels in novel ways. If you ever get stuck on a level, it's really easy to go look at the top 20 run times and see a replay of how other people completed the level. They're pretty crafty!This game is quite difficult, but don't let that disuade you. Tinertia is surprisingly addictive.My only complaint is that using an analog stick (notably on my 360 controller, but I'm sure it's a universal issue) can make it somewhat difficult to precisely shoot the rockets. That is to say, sometimes you go higher or lower than you intend because you were slightly off by so many degrees. This may be solved by increasing the dead zone on the controller (which is an option they included in the game). Regardless, it's not a huge issue, and has not negatively impacted my experience of Tinertia.If you're still thinking about whether you want to invest in this game or not, DO IT! It's definitely worth it!"

It feels good to get better and better at manipulating the games physics. Kind of like Dustforce felt.The leaderboards aren't super populated but there's always a score above mine (either measured by time or by # of rockets fired)."

Thank god when someone did, they did it right.Controls are smooth. Getting into the flow of trickshot movement is bliss.Anyone who has ever enjoyed a game with rocket jumping, conc jumping etc... should buy this game. And those who havn't should buy it anyway. Its a unique, challanging, skill based platformer that delivers extreme statisfaction when beating levels.My thanks to the devs."
,Recommended,311930,20224986,"Posted: 2 January, 2016",all,stuffsz,"Tinertia is a 2D platformer with rocket jumping mechanics. You have access to a inifinite rocket launcher and one airdash, which resets everytime you touch the ground. Those sets of mechanics create a really dinamic and fast paced experience, it also adds a huge layer of depth and therefore a high skill ceiling.You play throught a set of 6 worlds, with most of them having 10 levels each. You could compare it to Super Meat Boy for example. The levels are generally short and reward with you badges depending on your completion. All levels have a time badge (self explanatory) and missiles badge (you can only use a certain number of rockets). They both create different ways to play through the levels and a good deal of replayability, the missiles badges in particular turns the levels in a sort of ""puzzles"".The controls are really precise, I played it with a keyboard and had no problems with it. Everything responds incredibly well as long you understand the physics of the game. There is no way to remap them, but they suit the game. There's gamepad support, and that seems to be prefered way to play, so should work just as well.The music is also really solid. I didn't quite like 2 tracks but everything else was really enjoyable.Finally, the graphics are really nicely done. Other than the death animations when falling out of levels (which you likely won't experience because of the quick resets), everything is great.Easiest way to say it, is that if you enjoy platformers, this is a easy choice even at full price. You can easily get around 20-40 hours of gameplay if you are going to get all the achievements, more time or so if you get invested in to the leaderboards. If you are not huge on platformers, you probably will not get as much replay value out of it, but It's still a really solid purchase for a really fun and unique 8-10 hours, definitely get it on sale in this case."

Swear to jesus,  spent about 3 hours mastering the final boss, and I got 21 on the world leader board for both rocket par and time.If you're into games with solid or unique movement (quake, tribes feel, etc.) this game was built for you. Great price for a fantastic platformer.-One quick reccomendation-Not sure if the devs read what people say here, but I wanted to comment really quickly on one of the levels in metropolis. In fact, it was the very last level. Anyways. In the last level, you first have climb whilst avoiding yellow bullets that shoot down the sides of the walls you are supposed to use. This is all fine and good, and I really enjoyed beating that part, however, directly after that, you jump to the left and you have to do the same thing, but this time, the platforms are falling. All of that is ok too, except for one thing. On the section where the platforms are falling, I felt like it was a bit random whether I succeeded or not. This is due to the fact that I could not see the yellow bullet things being shot down before I had to jump of the falling platforms. This made it impossible for me to time when I needed to jump onto the falling platforms to continue the level. And since I couldn't time it, I just kept playing till I got lucky. Other people might not have the same patience :P. It's a pretty simple fix, just move the camera to the left a bit during that section or something to that effect."

Many VR players are looking for polished content and Tinertia delivers.It is like a mix of Rayman Origins and Super Meat Boy. It is incredibly fast paced and the artstyle looks amazing in VR. It has a great soundtrack and the game has a great atmosphere all around. This game isn't a push over and the difficulty ramps up nicely.I didn't notice any slowdown or issues in VR.

What a hidden gem of a game....I first discovered Tinertia at PAX seattle a few years ago. They were just starting out. They had the 1st level done. This game has taken a while to get to were it is now. This game is PHENOMENOL... Its the reason I bought a xbox controller for my PC!You control a little robot that weilds a rocket launcher and you use explosions to propell yourself through the levels. The environment of the game is awesome and visually pleasing. The game is full of puzzles, cheats ( skipping parts of the stage), and explosions!There is a great leaderboard system for this game. It automatically saves your times as well as the number of rockets used to complete the stage. So basically a speedrun leaderboard + a efficiency leaderboard. This feature is 10/10 for competitive players. I was shocked to see myself in the top 10/20 in the starting levels. Hours were quickly lost to this game. Speed running this game is insanely fun and difficult.If you enjoy challenging and refreshing platformers I would highly recommend this."
