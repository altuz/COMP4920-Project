So unless you want to spend your money on an abandoned, unfinished project then give it a pass.It's a real shame, too, because this game could have been great with more work & polish, but sadly that will never happen now."
,Not Recommended,311980,16629520,"Posted: 22 June, 2015",all,SimplyLeon,Isomer is a great game that HAD potential... But unfortunatly the Developer of Isomer is either dead or he has some other rubish excuse for not completing this great idea of a game. Hopefully the Dev will be resurrected like jesus was but he can come back as developer jesus and finish the game he started to create. Other than that i would say its a good purchase but its not worth it until the developer decides to use social interaction with the people that payed to fund the creation of Isomer.
,Recommended,311980,11189956,"Posted: 11 July, 2014",all,Zone FNF,"Isomer is an interesting mixture of surivial and basebuilding gameplay from games such as Dwarf Fortress combined with combat and exploration elements inspired by the Xcom series. The overall premise can be summed as reverse Xcom, you play as an alien force stumbling upon an already habited planet yet seeking to colonize never the less. Starting off with your humble dropship and ten workers, it is your job to survive and thrive in an hostile world. Overall in its inital steam release status, I'd say that Isomer is a very promising game. Currently I feel as though the foundations for a great base building and exploration are present though the content may be too barebones for some. So far I've noticed four diffrent unit classes, a wide array of generated structures for the player to explore and various different building blocks for the player to use. However the selection of middle and late game structures don't seem to be implemented. For example you can build your base to the extent of its layout with lights and lifts to different floors, but there are no doors present in the game nor any sizeable modules and things to fill up these rooms apart from soils to contain reasources.Check out my Let's Play below!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7VcA1f11R8"

,Recommended,311980,11370980,"Posted: 22 July, 2014",all,Greyon,"I can't quite put my finger on it, but this game really scratches an itch for me.  It's an interesting blend of old school X-Com, Minecraft, and a little bit of tower defense thrown in for good measure.  I find it hard to put down as there is a continual ""in a few more seconds my next step in the grand plan will come to fruition"".  It's definitely still being polished but there is a lot here to like already.  I've easily gotten my money's worth already, and am still discovering things each time I play."

It's a cool concept for a good price but the dev left without a word with the game only a quarter finished. Most of the time I have logged was spent either trying to figure out what the hell I am supposed to do or leaving the game running after I stormed out of the room when an engineer tunneled in and took out my core. And who makes a game where the only save feature is to quit?  It was a cool idea that do to lazieness and lack of communication, became crap."
