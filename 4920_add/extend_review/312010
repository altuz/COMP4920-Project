,Recommended,312010,12925934,"Posted: 13 November, 2014",all,(SK^GI)*Skullripper,"The story is simple: Your daddy is killed by a bird. You avenge your daddy.This game is short, but really awesome! Reach your car by shooting your way to it. Watch out for the walking/flying bird though, they can kill you too!It's an easy game, it's almost impossible to die, but also almost impossible to finish a level without getting any damage.After some levels, you get a mini-boss, well... mini isn't the best word, I'd prefer HUGE boss. You'll get the joke when you play it.I would call it an AAA-game, but since that a cheap game like this one can't be AAA, I'll just call it a AA-game. It's only 2,99 euros and completely worth it.Killing birds is the only thing you have to do. After each level, you go shopping with the money you got for selling the dead birds. You start off with a simple hunting rifle and near the end of the game, you become invincible with your hunting minigun, that's right, a freakin' minigun. It's gets even better! There is no reload and infinite ammo!This game is great for when you got bored playing your 'daily'-game and need some relaxation. Personally I had a lot of fun in this game, too bad it will only take you around 1-1.5 hours to finish.Pros- Kill birds!- Awesome weapons- Funny aspects (like the bosses)- mini-gamesCons- Game is too short- Almost impossible to die- Bad story-line (don't judge)Rating7/10would play again.Recommended?Yes, I recommend it. It's cheap and it makes you smile. Eventhough it's small, it's fun. Tips for the developers: Make an 'endless'-mode, just as it says: Running endlessly until you die, with maybe a leaderboard."

,Not Recommended,312010,32525438,Posted: 17 June,all,Otis,"The artstyle is actually pretty decent and is reminiscent of the flash games you'd see back in the day on Newgrounds, except the charm begins to wear off quite fast as the assets are not varied enough and you'll be seeing most of the same enemies, props and even boss battles repeated in an already incredibly short game. The gameplay is also far too repetitive and the mid to late game boils down to simply holding the left mouse button down and aiming wildly due to overpowered weaponry. Bird Assassin isn't really a funny game per say but it certainly isn't serious, you spend the 30 mins to an hour the game offers colecting different species of bird you've shot in order to deliver to and feed your family. Not a bad premise for a simple game but nothing gameplay wise really changes level to level and the only sort of progression is your gun unlocks which are all cheap and relatively easy to aquire. The game also has a heavy focus on platforming to the point where the majority of my deaths were due to not noticing something barely next to me on the floor which didn't feel very rewarding when I had to restart the level. Shoehorned bonus levels and no other mechanic besides shooting, jumping and healing make this game far simpler than it needed to be. The music is basically non-existent and the cries of dying birds and endless gun discharges gets annoying as hell even if it is for just a half hour. The game is definitely worth the asking price of $2 since it falls in to the category of a short mobile title or something along those lines, but in my opinion it's just not worth the time as I think you can find something less repetitive and of more substance even in this price range."

Kill every bird you see but will you want to play this game ? In Bird Assassin we play as a redneck. One day our Pa is killed off by an Ostrich and its up to us to avenge the death of you're pa by killing all the birds. So how is this game ? It's actually really fun and for the price its also a really fun and a difficult game. The game is a 2D platformer where you scroll along the level killing birds and jumping on platforms to avoid bushes and bear traps. Overall the game is fairly simple and all the levels are the same but they get harder as they go on. There are a few problems with the game. The game is fairly short it only took me an hour to beat and its quite easy to get the best gun in the game and you can blast through the other levels easily. But for the asking price its definetly worth it and i really suggest you check this game out. I give Bird Assassin a 7.5/10

It's because they've been playing this game WRONG! I bet almost everyone who has bought this game has played it all wrong. Now, admittidly on your first playthrough you can beat the game in 1-2 hours and by the end of the game you'll probably have unlocked everything and you'll have all weapons and then you beat the game. Well, it was a fun game but no need to play it ever again, i mean the music is boring and the gameplay is repetitive, overall it's an ok game. That's where you're wrong! What you need to do is make the game better! How do you do that? Listen to your own music!You know how when you're listening through an album but you just sit there and do nothing but listen through that album and think ""Man, i wish i had something to occupy me while listening through this album."" If you're looking for a game to occupy you while listening through an album, this game is for you! Now granted, this may not work with all genres of music. I don't think this game would go very well with Taylor Swift or whatever crap people listen to these days but the genre i'm specifically thinking of is Metal! For all you metalheads out there, you'd be pleasently suprised how awesome this game is when listening to Pantera or Slipknot. It's actually really cool and fun!Long story short if you're looking for a game to listen to music too then i totally reccomend this. If you're not looking for a game to listen to music to then i still reccomend this game. For a 2 dollar game it's hard not to reccomend this. If you even have any interest in buying this game then yes, buy it. You will have a good time, especially once you buy everything from the in-game store."

It very much feels like an app, albeit a relatively good one. The game's over pretty quickly and starts out pretty fun. Eventually, the game becomes very repetitive, and with  the unlocks, it soon becomes mind-numbingly easy. Fun for a bit, and worth the dollar or so. Don't expect much to change over the 15 or so levels in the game. After all of the different types of birds are introduced, the game stays pretty much the same.
