,Not Recommended,312280,29904932,Posted: 13 February,all,archlinux,"Had a nice graphics and sound, a convenient option for free chess on steam. A while ago the game stopped working on Linux (more users confirmed), so I cannot recommend it anymore. For a profesional chess player, get the paid version like Fritz or others, for free users, get some open-source chess available for linux.Do not recommend due to no support/interest of developers in fixing bugs."

,Recommended,312280,29684918,Posted: 3 February,all,Jaeger,"Simply Charming!Its all the in title of the game really, thats what you are getting. not poker, not ludo, not bloody go fish But a respectable and sophisticated game that has been adapted and reformatted for over 1000 years..When you have played for as long as i have, its quite a complex game. one with many things to learn when you start playing for more than 2 hours (Most people dont arent very devoted, which is ok since there is a learning cap in this game anyway.) Although once you have learnt everything its up to the original structure of the game itself to keep you interested!I grew up playing chess, so it was just a matter of time untill i played this.Pretty much does what it says in the description, nothing more, nothing less. And i love it for that.Its no skyrim or cs go but its a very relaxing Board game for the more patient of the steam players. :)If chess itself doesnt interest you then obviously dont get this, but if you like challenging board games where you have much control over the difficulty and style then try this!oh yeah..and its free (Although consider buying the premium edition if you have played over 10 hours ;)Nothing is more satisying then taking out all the opponents pieces except the king..-Kyle"

76561198116210937,Recommended,312280,29448287,Posted: 23 January,all,grinningchimera2,"A great computer chess game. I only have 2 critisisms of this free game. Firstly when playing online against a friend a number of times with the opening move it will not register on the other persons screen meaning we have to restart the game. Not too much of a problem because it only ever seems to happen for the first move, but still annoying. My other issue that has been addressed by others in the review section, is the ability to have multiple queens of the same colour on the board at one time. It is my understanding that when a pawn reaches the far side of the board that player gets to select a previously captured piece from the opponent. This means the game becomes less about tactics and more of a race to the other side to get another queen.But apart from these 2 issues I have this still the best chess game on steam. And it's free. 8/10"
