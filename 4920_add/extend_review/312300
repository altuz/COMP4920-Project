It's still tense as anything and some parts had me screaming internally because most of my decisions are me playing by luck and some of those choices were NOT FUN oh my lord. If you haven't had the absolute pleasure of reading HR: The Prodigy and HR: The Hero Project, the first two parts of this trilogy, then you are missing out on one Hell of a time. This is a choose-your-own-adventure on a whole 'nother level of 'OH MY GAW WHY DID I DO THAT' and crippling regret. Given all of them are really cheap too, it's entirely worth it - you get more than your money's worth, so long as you enjoy reading and also shaving twenty years off your life because this stress is just too damn much.TL;DR: I will recommend this until the day I die, along with the two prior installments."

In most games with such choices it's little more than a 2 way branch, or nothing but choosing a particular ally before going right back to the same path. Railroading bores me. Heroes Rise... Does not. The choices felt like actual choices, with actual consequences, influinced by prior choices and changing future choices you might have. This gave the game a fluid feeling and made it actually feel like those choices really mattered and influinced the world.At the end of the game I got to see my choices come to a head, and got to see the results of those choices. I was particularly pleased when my decisions caused almost every conflict I was going to have, break down into infighting as half my enemies joined me instead. Knowing what I did made such a difference was an extremely satisfying feeling, one that most games do not offer. The focus on story rather than flashy graphics allowed the game to become something far greater than the pretty but. frankly, boring games I usually get to see or play, and certainly left me eager for more. I look forward to what this developer produces next."

But I found myself suddenly thrown into a linear plot where my choices didn't matter. The previous games are very open to letting you decide your own emotions and reactions, which is what you expect from a CYOA. But after being told I ""have no choice"", ""the only way"", ""You know you have to""... etc, over and over, I realized I was just reading a book with buttons that I was no longer in control of. The final straw for me was the game deciding FOR ME who I romanced and kissed. Without me choosing. Also, power cost information usually leads to ""wow that cost more than you thought"" - which I'll admit IS in line with the plot, but ends up being frustrating when you were trying to be strategic.I'd say buy this on sale if you really enjoyed the first two games, but be prepared to relinquish control over any major plotlines or decisions."

They create their own games and host other games that people write using their software. If you care more about plot than cutscenes and running around then you will like this game, if you don't then perhaps you should go play something else. I love visual novels, and this is very similar except no pictures.This is the third and final game of the original trilogy (they are supposed to release a fourth game with a different protagonist). You can import your saves from the second game or start new. There are a lot of choices and endings in this game, or at least it seemed like there were more compared to the first one. The major villian from the first game shows up as a companion this time, and now you are on the run from the law. Your parents, who were put in jail for killing a supervillain, are about to be executed, and you need to find a way to save them without getting arrested. There are several romances, and you can be male/female and gay/straight. All the romances from the firs two games show up again, and new ones are also avaliable."

I'd played Psyhigh before a loved it so figured I'd give this a shot for such a reasonable price and loved it even more. So rare to come across supers written outside comics especially this well done.I only really have one concern with now having finished Herofall and finding out there are plans for a splinterstory of the second hero project. I'm definately looking forward to it but there wasn't a save feature at the end of Herofall. I found on facebook that it will be a new protagonist but still a lot of things in Herofall that would effect the upcoming hero project. Hope a update comes out that lets me save my world because I'd love to have another playthrough but would hate to lose Rowan (my hero) in the process.Anyway now I have to go buy the rest of the choice of games library and will be sure to pick up Versus when it comes out!"

One that's entirely text-based. You start off as a little hero still trying to figure out who you are and you end as a big one, no matter what path you take, knowing exactly who you are. You'll go through so many ups and downs and surprises and disappointments and happiness and sadness and successes and failures, you'll get into all the great beat em up action that comes with being a hero and all the baggage and consequences, too. But if you stick to who you are, just like in life, you'll pull through and make the right calls, and become a legend. The fate of the world is in your hands. The fate of your world is in your hands.

How rarely do we get those in gaming?The whole thing is a bit more gamey now with even more meters to fill and choices that must be made depending on your meters. The new friend in your hero's ever-growing cadre of comrades is by miles the most interesting and bombastic character in the series, when so many of the others are either ""generic evil"" or ""[sexual orientation] [personality trait]."" There are even a few little puzzles here and there. The writing has definitely blossomed, too. (Thankfully, most of the author's obsession with gender/sex finally wrangled under control.) It's the first installment where, despite the world being against your hero, it feels like your hero has friends, can make more friends, or lose friends through being a jerk, rather than everyone just ambling through a demented plot point assembly line. There is less intrigue, but more danger, more tension, higher stakes.If you bought the other two, you're probably already eying this one. If you haven't get the other two and know with confidence that the author delivers on what is promised through the series. No deceipt here, no trickery, no cause for regrets.

Your choice throught the three games, really affect the story line, and in this third game the fight and tactical choices are far more easier to decode (and unlike in Prodigy you can have different outcomes due to them). So yeah, game mechanics gotten really better, the only thing I still miss is a manual save, since it can happen that you accidentally chose an other answer then you wanted, and then all you can do is start from the top...

More specifically they are in the vein of the Chose your own Adventure books I adored so much as a kid. And like them the first in this series(Heroes Rise: Prodigy) has a bit of railroading going on. You might just want to scream at the main character.That said I enjoyed this third installment much better than the first one in the series. Since it is the end of the main character's story the choices have been opened up a great deal and you really get to feel as if you are shaping the world you are in. In addition at first glance it appears there are many carryovers from your choices in the first two of the series, thus lending more weight to those decisions that may have felt pointless at the time. I am not sure how much that actually effects though since I only went through all three games once.That said while I am divided on whether I would recomend the first installment, and while I am kinda meh on the Hero Project, this third installment I can say is truely an epic end. It is nice to see something end strongly for a change. All to often the last installment, or chapter of a story feels like a let down. It is rather hard to end something well. And for all the faults some find with Heroes Rise's start, it ends in HeroFall on a very solid note."

I highly recommend giving this a try.With its truly engaging storyline, it helps establish a connection the player has with their own character; a connection inevitably strengthened by one's ability to choose to respond to every event in ways they see fit, whether one wishes to play into the narrative-identity of one's character or decides to be radically different at every step. With these two elements, it proves to be quite a noteworthy “choose-your-own-adventure” game. 8/10//ProsComic book-esqueAction-packedMyriad of alternate choice pathwaysOptional romancesUnderlying philosophical themes -- Identity, Freedom, Security, Morality, to name a few.Genuinly Surprising plot twists//ConsNo option to choose/create a unique power setSomewhat limited in regard to fighting options -- you might not like that your hero's creativity is limited to the authors.Often extremely unpredictable and unwanted consequences based on answer choices -- usually you understand the implications of an action, but some choices are unpredictableA few typosHetero-normative -- if you're looking for a progressive read, you might not find yourself fully satisfied(This game shows potential for more products like this to be released for the PC market.

I liked it.(optional let's play footage)http://youtu.be/2kygobwgcJkWow the graphics of your imagination are ♥♥♥♥ing incredible! This game looks amazing lolIt's a choose your own adventure novel. In the fictional world is it common for people to have super powers, kind of like X-men. There are both heroes and Villains. Oppression and discrimination are strong themes i.e. against people with super powers. This is the third title in a trilogy. But you can play this without having completed the previous two games. But I think it's recommended that you have at least completed certain chapter of the previous books.You have to read a lot lol. From what I can gather from these games you can't really choose to play as a Villain which is what I would like to do. But it does put in you in a situation where you can or you have to cooperate with the bad guys. Which from the look's of it will be a major element of the plot here. Okay, maybe the ideas in this game aren't completely original. I'm pretty X-men had featured same sort of stuff. And some of the scenes are kind of cliche. For example one character repeatedly attempts to warn their companions that danger is imminently approaching, but each time is ignored or cut off until the danger is right at the doorstep and that character even says 'I told you so' lol. But to be honest this didn't really bother me. The narrative seem to have enough substance to be interesting. It's far from the worst thing I've read.I really enjoyed really playing this game.

After doing that I can't gather the the power in my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to give a♥♥♥♥♥♥if she comes or not, so I say ""Yeah your my best friend and remember how you think you saved me all those times when I actually saved your♥♥♥♥♥ Remember that?"" I decide to teleport but I need a teleporter so I go to Gay Gardens and I talk to GG and he gives me information and a♥♥♥♥♥♥slap to the face. We go to Millenial Tower where since I didn't tattle on the two... things? Having sex in the bathroom they don't ♥♥♥♥ me up. So after having my record of straight sex not being broken a drug addict calls ""da police."" So they can hook him up with some of those drugs Rebellion offered me. So I command the Millenial group to do some stuff and I succeed on every one because it's so easy. I face Rebellion after having powedered our noses in his secret little hideout place in a museum. I roll then punch rebellion then I cripple rebllion using my gun, pew, pew. I take no damage, but ♥♥♥♥♥ is in trouble oh sorry, I mean Jenny (Roasted!) is in trouble so I move her a cenimeter very awkwardly and she gets shot. My character is sad but in real life I'm celebrating my friends are over I invited the neighborhood, we opened up some beers, we have party hats, Black Magic comes and ♥♥♥♥s up Rebellion... Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥she's awake. I had already knocked out Rebellion on 3v so I tell Black Magic ""BB, it ain't the wight fing to do, you hero, me stick my♥♥♥♥♥♥in you, we all happy."" She is touched by my words and we awake on some boat, I then kiss her and we fortify our relationship. This won't backfire, not at all. I wake up on the boat and Prodigal's there after me and Black Magic had sex. Then I see something from the sky somethingon a magic carpet! It's a Saudian Arabian, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's Aladin! No, it's just Pressie... Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥Pressie! My favorite character from the entire game he's so happy and cheerful and... ""I'm serious now Metal Man, I jacked off to wikipedia in the rain forest so some monks let me jack off to their old man bodies so I'm good now."" Damnit, you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s ruined Pressie! How the hell do you mess up Pressie, he's Pressie for gods sake? ""I'm going to ♥♥♥♥ off once I get you on this boat."" No! Why god, why would you do this? Pressie was amazing but you messed him up. Anyways he never says anything else and is not mentioned ever again. We're on the ship and I answer these door questions correctly. Then I see Miss Artillery being lifted into a big bowl of chili, I shoot with my plama pistol but it doesn't fire. She dies and writes ""Dad VI"" What does that, oh♥♥♥♥♥♥her dad is Victon. Yeah game, it's pretty damn obvious, I didn't need a clue or anything. Prodigal punches me but I regain my powers but this time thier infinite so I ♥♥♥♥ up some♥♥♥♥♥♥and I fly back to Millenia City. Is that what it's called? I dunno. After getting back to Millenia city I go to the hospital thinking I'm going to ♥♥♥♥ some♥♥♥♥♥♥up. No, I'm seeing Jenny. ""Oh thank godd your here Metal Man, if that blast was an inch closer it would've killed me."" ♥♥♥♥. I dropped the ball here, I though I killed the ♥♥♥♥♥, but I ♥♥♥♥ed up in killing her. I then tell her it's Victon and she's like, ""okay ♥♥♥♥♥♥."" Then she says we're even...? I let my girlfriend go into a coma because I wasn't there to protect her because you wanted to investigate some sneaky♥♥♥♥♥♥and then you try to help me when I didn't want you to and you get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you? Then I save your life, and you did what exactly, came at the right time when I could handle myself and just beat some simple guys for me and you called that even... ♥♥♥♥ you. No seriously ♥♥♥♥ Jenny I'm fed up with her♥♥♥♥♥♥ Jury comes and says I'm right about Victon and then I recruit him. Let's cut to the chase. I have an army and I've broken into the devoid I break out the Millenial group and that one guy that put my girlfriend in a coma, then I re-capture all of the prisoners. I do some cool♥♥♥♥♥♥ I save my parents from getting de-powered, my girlfriend Black Magic shows up and I tell her to do some♥♥♥♥♥♥ I then team up with every enemy I've ever made and they join my side (Except Rebllion and Victon.) I walk up and Jury an his mom dry hump while I confront Victon. Victon shoots at me but Prodigal takes the shot because she showed up just in time. I try to heal her but she's ♥♥♥♥ed so I take her blood sample and it's a 100% chance she's Victon's daughter. I punch Victon in the face, not killing him. The war is over and I get my reward I look over my options and then I see something, despicable. The Millenial Group Leader is not an option... what the ♥♥♥♥! After everything I've done for them! My relationship with Black Magic is 100% and she's a member, I've always chosen their side and I beat their leader twice. I'm the strongest infi powered in the world and what the ♥♥♥♥ do I get? Fringe guy, and sponsored hero. What the ♥♥♥♥! I changed history itself I bend physics I beat your leader, I stand by you through thick and thin, and I lead you in an army and you don't think I'm good enough to be your leader? Is one of my stats not high enough? ♥♥♥♥ stats  want my choices to matter I want to be their leader I want to be the one that in the end you give me a ♥♥♥♥ing reward not some ""you got your parents back who said one word each throughout the entire game, hurray?"" No ♥♥♥♥ you Hero's Rise I'm ♥♥♥♥ing done with you thank god your trilogy is over and I don't have to be dissaointed with your ending again, ♥♥♥♥ you.

It's definitely the best out of the 3 games in the series. Thankfully the god awful alliance mechanic is gone and you don't have to worry about being 100% lone wolf or some bull crap like that and can experience the story much more organically. In it's place a much better mechanic is introduced- balancing regaining your powers and keeping your health up. The plot this time around is also much more exciting. Your characters are constantly on the run, keeping things exciting. There are some nice twists and turns along the way and I have to mention that I was actually genuinely impressed by one of the character of Prodigal. The game actually tries to experiment a little bit with the story telling with her character. Even though she is an ex villain she gets a chance at redemption and the player gets a chance to work alongside her and even romance her in a really adorable scene with very bitter consequences. Personally I'd love to see more of experimental things like that in the future, since I hardly think any Bioware game will ever allow you to form any sort of bond with the main antagonist, it's up to indie studios like Choice of games to play around with stuff like that.Over all I'd recommend all 3 games. They are all on the short side but for that price they are just right. They are like little pocket rpgs that you can easily digest and forget, leaving knowing you had fun.Quick, cheep and fun.

This instalment finally feels like an actual superhero story from the comics, a rollicking good Big Summer Crossover Event exploring the setting's ideas, advancing storylines, and setting up new ideas for further comics, etc, where The Hero Project was clunky and The Prodigy spent too much time filling in a science-fictional world in which to place its superheroes.However, it's still the only Choice Of Games product I've yet played which keeps putting the game mechanics in the text. And that's clunky as all get out.A middle act that stripped out the reality show aspect of THP while doing the same conflict with the InfraOrder and the Meek, strip out the more obvious gamist intrusions and, if the game proved too hard for people to continue on without those in-text hints, some recalibration - I mean, transferring your health to beef up your power reserves as a character option ahead of combats? What? Utterly out of genre and out of narrative - and I'd be praising this series. As it stands, it's just not on the level of their best, but overall, may be worth a look if you like supers."
