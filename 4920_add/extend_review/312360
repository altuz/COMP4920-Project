76561198033208882,Recommended,312360,12763629,"Posted: 3 November, 2014",all,WW1_Veteran,"I wrote a very critical, barely positive review for EAW six weeks ago, when I had only about 32 hours played on version 1.0.  In that review, I complained about the game's counterintuitive attack/defense outcomes, inscrutable casualty calculations, supply system flaws and ahistorical patterns.In the meantime, I have played through the game twice and racked up over 200 hours played.  Additionally, patch 1.1 was released during this time.  In the light of these new developments, I am happy to adjust my review from ""barely positive"" to ""strongly recommended.""Patch 1.1 made great improvements to the game's overall playability.  Almost as soon as I downloaded the patch, I noticed that combat outcomes seemed much more in line with historical realities.  Entrenched infantry with artillery support inflicts extremely heavy losses on the enemy, while suffering comparatively little if well prepared.  This rewards good deployment and unit organization/choices (ie, GHQ creation, associated corps, combined arms + recon per stack, etc).  As a digital commander who ""attacks with a view to defend and defends with a view to counterattack,"" this warmed my heart.Supply issues are also much improved this time around.  In my first review, I bemoaned the AI's ability to penetrate deep into the interior, get cut off and suffer no ill consequences for its overextension.  Now, the realistic supply system allows me to cut off enemy armies and starve them out.Supply is a crucial part of the game, and it cuts both ways.  On the one hand, it allows you to cut off enemy armies.  On the other, it limits your own offensive gambits, since armies more than a hex or two away from a large city or depot quickly run out of supply and must cease offensive operations.  I find this forces you to really think about when and how you will launch offensives, giving as much thought to purely tactical considerations as logistical ones.  It takes time and study to learn the supply system in EAW, but I found it absolutely rewarding.  Supply  realities make it as possible to win victories simply by manuever and good positioning as it is by brute force.I found the abstracted diplomacy, decision-making and research system to be easy-to-grasp and fascinating.  I won some very interesting diplomatic victories in my second playthrough.  For instance, as the Central Powers, I kept the USA far from supporting the Entente, lured Bulgaria and Romania to my side, and even got Holland and Mexico to join the struggle against the vile French.  As someone who loves history and pondering ""what-if"" scenarios, these results really made me smile.EAW does a great job rewarding innovative gameplay.  There are so many ways to win, either by outright military aggression or slow-play attrition.  The National Morale system is a simple and effective way to mirror a Nation's slow disaffection (or enthrallment) with total war, and monitoring it during the game is both fascinating and rewarding.  It makes you realize that often in modern war, the object is not to seize capitals or destroy armies in set-piece battles, but simply to convince your opponent to give up.Leadership is one of my favorite things about EAW.  Every general has unique strategic, offensive and defensive capabilites.  Some commanders are better attackers than defenders.  Some are better army group leaders than field commanders.  A well-led stack makes the difference between victory and defeat.  And for those who are somewhat familiar with the scintillating historical personalities at play in WW1, shuffling around your favorite generals--and watching them win in battle--is oddly inspiring and emotional.Yes, EAW takes time to learn and to play.  But if you are really interested in this historical era, it stimulates like no other game I've played.  You will find yourself watering at the mouth to plan your next moves, and you won't mind the 4-5 minute turn times as your brain processes all the fascinating things that are happening (or might happen) on the map once the CPU finishes its move.Needless to say, the game offers immense replay value, too.  You can play as a different alliance, or you can choose from a host of alternative initital warplans.  With each game lasting up to 100 hours, what you have is a game that will keep you entertained (and educated!) for a very long time.My only remaining complaints are minor: Sometimes the game crashes on complex turns; and the Serbian army is a real pain in the neck, next to impossible to fully kill.  Also, I would love it if the game had an original, epic soundtrack, and some more WW1-specific battle sounds.I am happy that my opinion changed on this game, and I encourage serious-minded strategy lovers to give this game a whirl.  It is worth your while.Final score: 90/100.PS: Devs, would you mind buffing General von Falkenhayn a little??  He's acknowledged by many historians as being one of the world's first ""modern generals,"" equally at home on the defensive and the offensive.  Yet in the game his numbers are pretty weak!  Let's show him some love!"
76561197990113610,Recommended,312360,11926734,"Posted: 30 August, 2014",all,NewWorldGamer,"To be completely honest, I've only recently been introduced to the likes of titles by AGEod, the developer and publisher ofTo End All Wars. Having been eager to play their other title, the ambitious lookingCivil War II, I decided to hold off on purchasing that one because I discovered thatTo End All Warswas to be released soon, which seemed like a title that was a little bit more up my alley. As a history fanatic and appreciator of the massive scale and scope that the real WWI exhibited,To End All Warsseemed like a title that appeared to reflect that to some degree. Boy, is that a complete understatement!While other WWI titles on Steam such asMaking History: The Great Warhave done a rather credible in delivering an overall WWI experience,To End All Warschronicles the more minute, although vastly important, details surrounding the conflict itself. From arranging the chain of command of units, production and supply chains, alliances, and the historicity surrounding actual hisotrical leaders, the game envelopes you into a world in which every decision has to be carefully calculated and where slight errors in preparation for a battle are equally, if not greater, than the actual battle itself. I've spent more time in this game just preparing for a battle than ACTUAL battling, and this is certainly not a negative aspect but rather a highly postive one in my opinion!The slow pacing of the game is where I find true enjoyment, in which I actively have to plan and strategize my moves in the most careful of ways. For this reason alone,To End All Warsmay not be a game for everyone, especially those gamers who like quick paced gameplay and actually controlling their their armies in the battles they participate in.To End All Warsis more of a stat-driven game, where you are looking at the numbers surrounding your involvement in the war conflict and calculating how to utilize them in the most efficient matter possible. This might seemboringto some, but it is actually more accurately reflecting upon the realism of what actual war is like, where statistics and win probabilities are the main driving force behind any warring conflict. Because of this reliance on stats and probabilites, the game does take quite some time in between turns, often times taking minutes for the AI to calculate their next move. While this is perhaps the most noticeable downside to the game, considering the massive amount of information that the game has to forage through given each turn, it's somewhat understandable. While I'm certainly not being apologetic (I myself would like to see a decrease in time in taking turns), I am simply being pragmatic when it comes to how much information the game showcases!This adherence towards realism is whereTo End All Warsbrilliantly shines, and where I wholeheartedly recommend it to any gamer wanting a true, authentic look into WWI. It is simply incredible in what AGEod was able to do here, bringing about a game that has certainly moved to the top of my list of WWI titles that do the conflict justice. Those gamers wanting to actually participate in real-time battles need not apply, but for those wanting to focus on the internalities of how WWI was more accurately fought and playing campaigns that will last you months, thenTo End All Warsis the game for you."

There is very little room for learning how to manage a single front, and you are expected to take control of the entire war, like... right away? x) Otherwise it does look great so far, with it´s detailed decision, research and battle systems and calculations etc.Great sequel to ""Civil War 2"", a game that managed to make the most over-analyzed war in history interesting as hell, but still, good to be back on European soil (or should I say mud?), fighting as/with or against Fredrick the Great´s ancestors x)"
76561198127069228,Recommended,312360,21073994,"Posted: 9 February, 2016",all,Comrade Hero Winterpunch,"This is a superb military strategy game.  It might look expensive and clunky, and you might hear some complaints about turn times,  but if you're interested in a deep, thoughtful game which reasonably accurately mimics the Great War and has a great deal of replayability, this is the best I've come across.Unlike other titles I'm familiar with (e.g. Commander: The Great War, Making History: The Great War), this one captures a lot of the feel of WW1, in the sense that battles become increasingly horrific in terms of casualities, you will find yourself scrabbling for every tiny advantage, and, the longer the war goes on, the more worn out your faction becomes.  That's not so say it's all trench warfare, indeed, it can be quite open depending on how the war plays out, but you cannot play this like just another war game.The game takes account of different troop types, reinforcement, attrition, terrain, weather, commanders, blockades, diplomacy, logistics and chemical weapons.  You are able to reel and recover from gigantic losses if you're smart, but may see your offensives broken up by the harsh reality of industrialised warfare.The manual is not well written, and the game can be opaque, but the forums have a lot of helpful tips, and just playing the game to learn it is part of the fun.  This game is rich, and it *will* take you hours to get to grips with it, but it is complex in a way unlike other wargames I have played, and, as a WW1 nut, relatively faithful to the period while still allowing for alternative histories.Highlights- cutting Gen. Rennenkampf off in the Prussian woods- spending 2 years chasing Serbian guerrillas around the Balkan mountains and blowing up their depots- starting the 3rd Boer War- invading Belgium before Germany does- having the US army deliver a railway gun to a port with no railway access, so it can't be moved- attempting (and failing, three times) the Gallipoli landings- sending the British Egyptian Army across the desert and forgetting that they need water, food and ammunition- sending Zepplins to bomb London- not attacking Verdun- GAS GAS GAS!Buy this if you want the next step up from Paradox titles, and are interested in historically detailed games."
76561198063824871,Recommended,312360,11945039,"Posted: 1 September, 2014",all,Roderick ''Blutbad'' Feldrank,"To End All Wars is a new grand strategy game released by Ageod.The game allows the player to take the full command of the Central Powers ( Germany and Austria-Hungary ), the Western Entente ( France, the United Kingdom and Belgium ) or the Eastern Entente ( Russia, Serbia and Montenegro ) during the Great War ( which we talking a lot recently since it happened a century ago ).One you've picked your side, you are in charge of the supreme command of your alliance in terms of military, politics and research. At the start of a game ( depending on the game mod you play ) you have to decide a long term plan for the war. It can be realistic (.e,g.  Schlieffen plan for Germany or Plan XVII for France ) or not. Then it's up to you to find the strategy to take down your enemy.When you play To End All Wars, you could perfectly imagine yourself playing a board game. The map and graphism are actually close to what you would have playing on a table. Talking about the map, some will like it but others not. It's not as nice as the lattest Paradox Interactive map but EAW's managed to display a clean map of Europe and the Middle-East, very detailed. The rest of world, with the colonies or other nations, is represented by boxes on the sides of the map. The game has a huge pool of units, for each nations ( Cossacks, Foreign Legion, Scottish Highlanders, Cameroon colonial troops,...etc ) with each their abilities, strong and weak points. Naval and aerial battles are also present, allowing the player an insane amount of possibilites.To End All Wars is a turn based game with each turn simulating 15 days. The player must prepare all his moves and the enemy will confront it and make his moves during the switch of turn. It works very wellthat way. Speaking of turn, the "" end-turn time "" can be a bit long. I understand the AI ( which is quite good ) has a lot to do during its own time but maybe some update could try to reduce this time.The music is also a strong point in the game. Real military music from various origins are present in the game, for amateurs, it's a huge plus in the ambiance.Strong points of the game :The difficulty !The AI !The music !The insane amount of various details !The detailed map !The "" board game "" ambiance!The tutorials !Weak or weaker points of the game :The end turn time !Too much time between the musics ( actually, there is an option to determine the delay betwenn songs, thanks to Eawamp for telling me this )Too confusing for new players, the possibility to control one nation and not its entire alliance could help this (playing only France for example and not the UK and Belgium with it )!Some parts of the interface could be better and less confusing.In general, I highly recommand this game !"
,Not Recommended,312360,12064514,"Posted: 11 September, 2014",all,Ilgoth,"I bought the game a week ago and I've gotten into it quite well. I had no previous experience about AGEoD engine. Lemme tell you my honest opinion about the game - no pun included.I love the concept and look of the game. I like how clean it is with it's main pressure on actual war and doing this all-aspects-in-mind made mechanics. A war strategy game with clear pressure on war and strategy, so simple and effective. However there are some clear mistakes made with this game and it isn't actually the game itself but the way they give it out to the player.First of all, tutorial isn't the best. While it tells every basics about the game, I find it extremely hard to follow. The instructions to do things didn't always help out and wasted some tens of seconds looking for the right button (the interface ain't the best either). The text box sometimes bugged and the text went out of the box and mixed up with the map behind, giving hard time to read the text.The tutorial didn't include things about researching either, though the timeline of the situation in the tutorial explains that. Still, it's negative thing.Another major negative side of the game is the manual. I tell you - been playing rpg-book games like Stormwind and tabletop games like Warhammers and Blood Bowl I have seen some tough rulebooks to learn and these guys go far beyond. It is bad! It includes all the info there but it's clustered under too many different paragraphs and sections! The order they present their things isn't the best either and to be honest, those two who wrote it didn't have the best written-english.The gameplay is enjoyable right after you get used to the interface and I find AI quite good for a beginner. It isn't a fool and can certainly surprise you. I haven't tested out the multiplayer yet, but Im sure it's really good. Only odd thing being that it works through email or another file sharing method. It's really different to compared to other strategy games in the market. Maybe it's due the fact they wanted to give players time to think their moves well. I find it positive and negative feature - go figure out yourself how you feel.Cut in short - game in itself is nice and I believe I find myself around it for some hours. But the game suffers from bad manual and mediocre tutorial, giving players a challenge to learn in the first place. Forums seem a bit dead too. So why negative review? It isn't worth it's price 36,99€. I bought it with -10% discount and still find that quite tough price to pay for this.If you are ready to use time to learn the game before even playing a minute and don't mind the multiplayer as it is - you can enjoy this game."

The map is large, captures the ""feel"" of the terrain and is visually pleasing.  However the real masterpiece is the game engine.  It is the same as CWII and comes with the same high level of support.  The power users ""know their business"" and share tips/knowledge liberally on the forums.   This reminds me of the great board games from the 70s and 80s - something I have not often seen.  And like those board games, EAW is complex and not a game that can be played in a couple of hours.  It takes commitment and patience, however rewards the user with both great simulation and historical education.  For those of us who have dealt with complex ""to hit"" and ""penetration"" tables in the past, the learning curve in EAW is not all that steep.  The engine does the work."

76561198002933633,Recommended,312360,11951030,"Posted: 1 September, 2014",all,animalshadow,"ENG:Nothing unusual, another masterpiece from AGEod! :)First, you will be scared away by the game interface, then the overload of the game screen, but after a couple of hours you will realize that this is a great wargame with a very decent simulation of military operations during the Great War.AGE engine well managed Civil Wars of Rome, gave a wonderful atmosphere of the Civil War in the United States and is now offering to try the First World War.Unlike other series of AGEod wargames, this one is really hard. We're offered to lead three great factions - Entente in the west, Entente in the East and the Central Powers.Managing so many units is not an easy task, but very interesting and challenging (for example: playing as Western Entente, from the start of the game you manage France, Great Britain and Belgium, for a person unfamiliar with wargames in general, and in particular with AGEod - it's hard to master in few minutes).Music, style of the game interface, wonderful drawn map and authentic portraits of the leaders provides unique experience of the atmosphere of early 20th century.Military operations on land and at sea are equal, which is very pleasing - blockade, naval raids, bombing the coast from the sea and the waves of infantry, endless machine gun rounds, cavalry raids and volleys of thousands of guns on the ground. Presence of little things such small things as the Communication Corps, field hospitals, Engineering Corps, balloons and etc. together very strongly enriched gameplay.AGEod engine perfectly combines mobile war in the east and trench warfare in the west.By the way, colonial warfare wasn't ignored too.All these elements together give a great dive in the First World War, no matter which faction you choose at the beginning (You'll play each of them, - I'm sure (:)If you are interested in the period of the Great War, and/or you have tried AGEod wargames before, then you will not regret acquiring To End All Wars.What is really missing for a smooth immersion in the game - it's a couple or even two couples of small scenarios (5-15 turns). But I think it's a matter of time.Personally, wargames from AGEod has never disappointed me.Will definetly recommed this wargame. ;)RUS:Ничего необычного, очередной шедевр от AGEod! :)Сначала вас отпугнёт интерфейс игры, потом перегруженность игрового экрана, но через пару часов вы поймёте, что это отличный варгейм с очень достойной симуляцией военных действий периода Великой Войны.Движок AGE отлично справился с гражданскими войнами Рима, замечательно передал атмосферу Гражданской Войны в США и теперь предлагает опробовать Первую Мировую Войну.В отличии от других серий игр AGEod, тут действительно тяжело, т.к. нам предлагают 3 огромные фракции - Антанта на западе, Антанта на востоке и Центральные Державы.Управлять таким количеством юнитов не просто(для примера:  играя за западную Антанту, со старта  вы управляйте Францией, Великобританией и Бельгией, для человека незнакомого с варгеймами в целом и с AGEod в частности это тяжело осилить с наскока), но очень интересно. Музыка, стилистика игрового интерфейса, замечательно нарисованная карта и аутентичные портреты лидеров передают атмосферу начала 20-го века на отлично.Военные действия на суше и на море равноправны, что очень радует - блокады, корабельные рейды, бомбардировки берегов со стороны моря и волны пехоты, бесконечные пулемётные очереди, кавалерийские рейды и залпы тысячи орудий на земле. Так же радует наличие таких мелочей, как присутствие бригад связи, полевых госпиталей, инженерных войск, аэростаты и т.д. Такие мелочи в совокупности очень сильно обогащают геймплей.Движок AGEod отлично сочетает в себе мобильную войну на востоке и позиционную на западе.Так же без внимания не оказались и колонии стран участниц.Все эти элементы вместе дают отличное погружение в Первую Мировую войну, не зависимо от того, какую фракцию вы выберете вначале(всё равно вы сыграйте за каждую, я уверен (: )Если вас интересует период Великой Войны и/или вы пробовали раньше варгеймы от AGEod, то приобретая To End All Wars вы не прогадайте.Чего не хватает для более плавного погружения в игру, так это пары или даже две пары маленьких сценариев на ходов 5-15. Но думаю, это вопрос времени.Лично меня варгеймы от AGEod ещё ни разу не разочаровывали, надеюсь и вас тоже."
76561198013433009,Recommended,312360,13827198,"Posted: 4 January, 2015",all,Gors,"This is a complex and deep strategy game that I recommend for those that feel games like EU4 or CKII or HoI3 are too simple or too high-level. This is not quick wargame, and people that expect such a game will be disappointed.It is turn-based, and because both the players turns are executed simultaneously, an additional layer of complexity is added. It gets better if you turn the realism options on, because common sense then helps to understand what happens in the game. There are so many factors to consider that ""gaming the system"" is difficult, and that's a good thing.The AI is challenging, for me at least.The dualplayer is Play By Email. It can take hours to issue the orders for 1 turn if you're a control-freak, and while a game-server of some sorts to coordinate games might be easier, emailing is easy enough.I've played their Civil War game (AACW) and Rise of Prussia for many hours and I'm enjoying myself in TEAW. Once you get over the learning curve, you'll find one of the better strategy games out there."
,Recommended,312360,23724803,"Posted: 23 June, 2016",all,Groundpenguin,"Possibly the best WW1 war game on the market currently.I have played a lot of Commander the Great War and Strategic Command ww1. Each game has it's own merits but personally I find that TEAW really gives you the biggest sense of scale out of the offering of ww1 strategy games currently.If you have played other AGEOD titles then you will be able to pick this up pretty much right away. If like me however you have never played an AGEOD title (Did dabble a little with Pride of Nations) then you will find the learning curve rather steep. The tutorial is kinda garbage, explaining little and leaving you to learn for yourself. There are however a number of good tutorials on YouTube for this and other AGEOD games so you can learn the game pretty quickly.Being a grand strategy game focused on warfare these games aren't quite as deep as the Paradox games out there but it does offer the real feeling of commanding tons and tons of troops.There is a technology aspect to the game however this amounts to putting money into aspects of research then a background dice roll determines if you gain a level or not. A number of the mechanics of this game give a feeling of a boardgame. Personally I love the boardgame style parts of the game, others might not feel the same of course.Combat in this game is based off of whatever units are initially involved in the combat, the terrain, the stats of the commanding officers and any reinforcing units. Combat is off hands (Apart from a tactics selection that can be turned on)  so you don't get involved during but rather the planning initially with troop placements, stances of stacks and picking of ground. there is an oddly therapeutic feeling when reorganizing armies after the initial mayhem of 1914. This is where a big part of the game lies, having your forces in the right place at the right time.In conclusion if you enjoy Paradox games, you'll probably enjoy this game. If you are looking for a ww1 strategy game, you will enjoy this game. If you like the AGEOD series then you will love this game as it's more of the same but on a larger scale."

Great historical simulation; they've done their homework on geography, history, and troop composition.  This game will teach you the horror of war from feeding your troops and keeping their magazines stocked to drafting new 18 year olds to man the trenches each year.The game accurately characterizes the leadership challenges faced by the lesser powers and the hopelessness of the Western Front.HOWEVER, getting the stupid, clunky, 100 year old AGEOD engine to function is a war of attrition in and of itself.  I have now spent 4 hour trying to get the August 1915 turn to resolve without an error, apparently inherent to the AGEOD engine.

For instance, during the initial invasion of Belgium and France, I can't even take Antwerp. I set up an experiment in which I tried to achieve nothing but that. I hauled all heavy guns to Antwerp, established military control of the region (so the city was under siege, I suppose), bombarded it, assaulted it, caused breaches, but could not take it. In the next turn, all the breaches were gone and the defenders (although under siege, I suppose) grew in numbers.I ask you, what is this travesty? I have given up.If I'm doing something wrong and someone wants to tutor me, I'll be willing to give it another shot.

,Recommended,312360,29569869,Posted: 29 January,all,ronster1970,"Do not often contribute for reviews but thought I would say something about To End all Wars.I had been looking for sometime for a good WW1 strategy game.  I find most do not capture that deepth of the period.  They play more like a WW2 game with old looking units, using ""blitz"" tactics in a period when it would take weeks to move.TEAW captures that slower non mobile, entrenched feeling.  This game is not a repackaged WW2 clone.  In my current game I am playing the Western Entente, the Germans swept into Belgium and through Luxemburg, the french where pushed back (nearly to Paris!!) but then things just jammed up and litterly bogged down.  The French/Britsh forces have pushed the Germans back to the Ardenees, with a line of trenches going to Ypres in the north and all along the French Border in the south.  The fighting is slow and brutal, with a single German attack against dug in French lines costing over 120k troops!The feel of WW1 is there.  You cannot rush troops around nor do reckless quick attacks.  You must find soft spots and plan attacks or your troops will suffer the consequences.Diplomcy is interesting, have Japan and Portugual on my side and working on Italy.  Oddly the US seems to be swing toward the Central Entente, now that would be a problem if they joined germany.Technoogy is well managed, Gas attacks by the West (my side) where used in early spring 1915 and I am expecting retaliation by the Germans soon.The interface in clunky and needs work but once you figure it out it does become easier.  The map is amazing, really like the detail.Improvements could be the ability to search.  I am constantly trying to find units or generals and there is no real easy way to search, for example you cannot type in a name and find where it is.  Also, the command structure is confusing, but maybe command in this period is supposed to be confusing.Overall, really enjoy the game.  It will take you a few starts and restarts to really get a game going.  Recommend you print , read and have the manual next to you when you are playing, it helps alot as this game has a lot of depth to it.If you are looking for that WW1 game to fill the hole in your collections, I do recommend this one."

I have no idea what I'm doing, tons of people are dying, and the frontlines look more or less the same as they did a month ago.10/10 would order infantry wave assaults on entrenched positions again.In all seriousness, this game is on the A.G.E. engine. If you've never played one before, it will overwhelm you. I've logged hundreds of hours in Pride of Nations, so most of it was familiar to me, although the sheer scale of WORLD WAR ONE is still a bit difficult to comprehend at first. A good deal of the complexity of Pride of Nations isn't there, such as the ""managing everything from fish to timber to automobile exports"", plus most of the world other than Europe and some of the Middle East/North Africa is condensed down to hotzones. However, that complexity is more than made up for by the fact that you are, again, managing ALL OF WORLD WAR ONE.No real buildup time, no ways to delay the war...boom, it's August 1914 and the Hun is basically already in control of Belgium. Plus you're controlling ALL OF either the Entente western or eastern front, or ALL OF the Central Powers...it would have probably been better if you were at least allowed to say ""I will play Great Britain, AIs will control France, Belgium, the US, etc."" The fact that all supplies, unit mustering, etc. are pooled between the nations is a bit offsetting, plus a rather major issue in the AGEOD engine that may not have been a big issue in previous games, but comes to light here in the war of the trench. Fortifications are a factor of the unit occupying them, rather than a terrain piece, and basically vanish when said unit leaves the region or goes on the offensive. There are ways to work around that, but it still destroys a big part of the First World War: the enemy taking a trench network and immediately being able to turn it againt its previous occupants.Overall, though, it's mostly just small issues. The BIG one is whether or not you enjoy this level of complexity. If you do, welcome to the front. If not, play literally anything else."

The gameplay is over complicated, the tutorial takes too long and the graphics are not great. But the worst and most frustrating part of this game is the time it takes to complete a turn. When you played your moves and you hit the end round button the frustration steps in. Each round covers a period of 15 days to complete while the other nations make their moves. There are no animations as conflicts happen and the turns “takes” ages to complete. It literally takes minutes … hit end turn and do some chores and hopefully when you’re done, the round is complete and you can start another frustrating period of staring at the screen or do some more chores. In my humble opinion this game is overpriced.So if you're not patient and willing to really wait, this game is not recommended. There are better and faster grand strategy games available."

Later though is began to crash on day 8, 10 or 14 meaning I would have to watch a majority of the turn and then watch it again. Now its starting to crash at the start and then at the end.
