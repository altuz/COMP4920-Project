76561198068035068,Recommended,312450,18115487,"Posted: 20 September, 2015",all,Devil Dog 4,"There are very good reviews that have come before mine, and many have composed their reviews with the Panzer General series in mind. For fans of that series, please do read those other excellent reviews. In my review, I'll attempt to cater to World War II history buffs out there, who have not tried any of the Panzer General titles, but are likely fans of the more mainstream Sid Meier's Civilization V.As  a Civ V fan and someone who has always been fascinated by World War II, IloveOrder of Battle: Pacific because it takes the best elements of the excellent combat system in Civ V, and enhances that experience further with certain mechanics that we all wish we could have had in Civ V. By the way, did I mention that this game focuses on WWII? And did I mention that this game is set in the Pacific Theatre of Operations -- a theatre largely (and sadly) ignored in the World War II game genre?Here is a list of some of the major, familiar combat mechanics common with Civ V that contribute to this excellent simulation:Hex-based (making maneuvering and placement an important element of your strategy)Effects on terrain on movement, cover, defense, efficiency, line-of-sight, etc.Unit stacking rulesFlanking bonuses/penaltiesSimulation of embarkation, disembarkation, river crossingsSupporting fire from nearby unitsZone of control...and here is a list of some of the major combat mechanics we wish we had in Civ V that further enhance the overall experience:HEXES CAN BE CAPTURED!(true Civ V fans know what this is about)A well-simulated supply mehcanic/system (and unique rules for land, air and sea to boot)...and caputred hexes come into play here as well!!!The effect of supply accesibility on units' combat efficiencyMines can be laid (and can affect everyone, even the original mine-layer)More evident effects of entrenchmentMovement affects efficiencyA service/combat history log for individual units!Unit renaming and personalizationSpecial rules for special forces/recon units...and many more!In summary, for those of you who loved the combat system of Civ V, but have also been craving a game where you could just focus on combat strategy (and World War II strategy at that), this is the game for you. The added combat elements and mechanics enhance the overall experience even further, and make this game a must buy for World War II history buffs and turn-based strategy game fans out there.Don't get turned off by the (seemingly) steep price tag on this game, it is well worth the money you will pay."
76561198035143735,Recommended,312450,18248233,"Posted: 29 September, 2015",all,Avanzarie,"Order of Battle: Pacific is quite simply, awesome! I have been playing war games for a very long time now, {over 25 years} and I can honestly say that this gamr, Order of Battel: Pacific, is the pinnacle of turn based strategy games for the WWII era. All of the best features of the Panzer General/Pacific General series can be found here all rolled into one nice little package. I have always loved turn based war games, but found that you usually got your choice between great land battles with awesome units, and a smattering of small sea skirmishes with wimpy naval and air units {Panzer Corp/Steel Panthers} or you go heavy on the Naval units with token land battles and very basic infatry/tanks {Pacific General}. In Order of Battle:Pacific you get both: great land combat representation AND a killer Naval/Air Corp to compliment your force of ground fighters. With over 550 units represented, fans of Army, Navy, and Air corps war games are sure to find something to love.All core units level up and stand a chance of gaining a commander through a random chance generator {ala Panzer General}. I like that, I always have where war games are concerned. It gives you a feeling of story and a real attachment to certrain units as they level and gain heroes/commanders. It's the hallmark of good game design and programming like this that really puts you into the game and makes you feel like you are a part of the story and not just watching it unfold. OoB:P really shines in this area. Also, they have made some long over due improvesments to TBS wargaming.For one thing, after you have clicked on a unit and ordered it to attack an enemy unit, you no longer need to wait for the graphic of battle to play out before moving onto another unit and another battle. Simply click and battle as fast as you like! And the sound FX are AMAZING! They will maintain the current battle noises AND incorporate all other ongoing battle noises as you go! At one point, i had artillery, tanks, infantry AND a dog fight involving a Navy Wildcat vs. Japanese Zero all being rendered at the same time! It truly sounded like a battle was taking place. Also, the sound FX for each type of unit are different according to the seperat specs of the unit. An allied Bearcat sound different that a Wildcat, and a Zero sound different that a Corsair. Even the bomber sound different than each other. so do the engine sound of a destroyer, cruiser, and battleship. They are all different! I dont know who did this, but it must have been a massive effort. And it is just another reason OoB:P draws you into the story so completely.Finally, there is one really nice touch that will appeals to WWII historians like myself: anniversary DLC. On the dates of some important WWII events, OoB:P will release anniversary campaigns to be played comemorating the event. The most recent being the Battle of Britain. At this time, I have not played this expansion, but feel confident it will be up to the same high standards as the rest of the games content.Overall, as I have already stated, Order of Battle: Pacific is the pinnacle of WWII turn based strategy gaming. A true Grandslam homerun for The Aristocrats and Slitherine Ltd. Well done my friends, well done indeed."

I'm a super fan of Panzer Corps with over 400 hours of play.  This game on the other hand, which should be similar is not very good.  The AI is ridiculously non-existant and should be called artificial non-intelligence.  The enemy litterally dosen't respond to weak points in your lines, it just plods on to objectives and does so poorly. You can easily just sit out of sight range and destroy carriers and ships with little reaction by the enemy. The game does allow you to change the difficulty level, but that doesn't change the AI, it just give them better combat multipliers to cause more and take less damage.Other issues I've encountered:- The amount of battles to gain any XP to improve your units has little effect through most of the campaign.- Recon units don't gain XP.- Tactical bombers lay waste to ships, but do little to nothing against just about everything else.- You are placed in situations where they have a large amount of slots for units to control, but you have don't have the money to buy even close to enough units to use the slots (early on in the campaign).- damaged ships dont fight at reduced capabilty, ie why should a BB or CV with 1 hp, be able to perform everything a ship at full health can?I have only played the campaigns as thats what I bought the game for so maybe the AI is better in the scenarios.Bugs:- US engineers destroy a bridge and the game locks up. I've actually had the Japanese campaign not respond after winning scenarios and it requires you to restart the whole campaign, only to have it do the same thing later in the campaign.- Land planes on ship and when they take off the unit is flying around, but a ghost of the unit takes up a spot on any carrier it lands on taking up aircraft space.I really want to love this game, but it seems to me like it's still in Beta."
76561198030858948,Recommended,312450,23307229,"Posted: 31 May, 2016",all,tiferet,"Probably the best hex turn based strategy game. Really I did not think it was possible to improve upon Panzer General mechanics, but with brilliant supply system, changing scenario conditions and secondary objectives that allow for changes in how the battle goes (need more of these!), events (again, more of this), true FOW (my planes flew over that village saw no one, now my infantry rides the truck and gets ambushed - brilliant) - the game is a gem. Sure it needs more polish, it should not be so hardware hungry with this level of graphics but there are no ideal games as there are no ideal people.The only minus is the way developer may handle DLCs - I hope you guys dont run too greedy - keep adding additional free stuff or set the price of DLC to 5 bucks, this will do you more good at the end mark my words."

Take this game engine and remake the Steel Panthers series and then you'll be on to something!!*edit* 8/18/15After beating both main campaigns I can say that the scenarios were interesting and very well balanced and designed. With a few of them I had to restart 2 or 3 times to get a force mixture that would allow me to win, but it was fun and not tedious. Many scenarios are really long, upto 60 turns+ and after a few missions I realized that the longer they were the more fun I knew I was going to have! Played it long into the night and even first thing in the morning it was the most fun I've had since Panzer General 2. Hats off to the devs hope to see more from them!"
76561198029704499,Recommended,312450,15623478,"Posted: 30 April, 2015",all,tora75,"I've been following this game for over a year and am happy with my purchase. It's basically Panzer General in the Pacific with better graphics AND:-Generals with abilities that affect the unit it is attached to and those around him. You can switch which unit he is attached to at the beginning of each scenario.-Specializations that you can unlock-More random events-choose which objectives to pursue from a predetermined list at the start of each scenario. You can gain cool abilities from some of them and cripple the opposing army, but   you won't always be able to complete them all. You will have to make tough choices as to which objectives you want to (or can) complete.-Much needed supply line mechanic-More strategic air and sea battles. I'm just diving in, but can tell you that there are slight variations in the mechanics of different units and situations that add to the strategy.I was initially concerned about the length of the game, but can happily report that I'm only into the third mission of the training campaign and already have enjoyed several hours of play time.It really is a nice game and right up my, ""point and click/ strategy"" alley. It keeps to a successful formula and builds on it. Like Panzer General and Panzer Commander before it, you can:-carry over units from one mission to the next (including their damage/kill stats).-gain veterency and upgrade units-attach generals with special abilities (in Panzer General you gained a random hero, which would attach himself to a unit who gained veterency. But the hero would be stuck to that unit. You couldn't reassign him like you can a general/captain/ace in this game).The only downside is the price for a game like this. While other Indie houses are charging around 20 bucks for similar titles, The Artistocrats are partnered with Slitherine. This means a chunk of the profits have to be split with another party; thus the higher price point. Unfortunately, this means that this really solid game won't reach as many people who haven't played this type of game before...at least anytime soon. They will all wait until this dips to about 20 bucks.  By then, development on a new game will be underway and the funds needed for future updates and dlc won't be as great. I really hope I'm wrong about this because it's a fun game and I'm looking forward to additional content!"

Check out the reviews for each campaign and you'll see real reviews.I absolutely 100% suggest people get this game it is fantastic.  Just remember it is basically a demo with a tutorial to let you see if you like the concept of what the game entails.  It's a great idea for war-games with a minimal crowd to give them a shot at trying outside of a full and proper (separate) demo download.

It's essentially Panzer Corp: Combined Arms reworked to be pretty and have a supply system that makes sense and adds a new dimension to the classic gameplay. Newbies to turn-based strategy will be shocked by the accessibility and learning curve - I can't think of any turn based game easier to learn, but harder to master.As far as the whiner reviews, ignore them. This is worth a try, and if you didn't get what you paid for ($0), that's a statement of your character, not the game."

From ships sinking to planes going down, it's the little touches that are icing on the cake in this game.The game itself stand strong on it's strategy elements, taking your army to war it's up to you on deciding how to spend your resources to get the job done. Do you spend more and build up a strong tank force, or do you put those resources into your air force - you decide.As with the likes of Panzer Corps you take your army from one scenario to the next in the campaign, with the benefit of the unit will have increased its veterancy through combat experience. So when you lose a unit it feels like a real loss and not simply cannon fodder (which arguably is closer to the actual WWII treatment of the common soldier).The interface is clean and friendly, the devs are responsive and actively fix bugs and if you are willing to put some time in to play through the tutorial you will be rewarded with a fun and satisfying gaming experience.This game is fantastic if you are a fan of the genre, but even better if you are new and just looking for a great strategy game - Order of Battle: Pacific will scratch your itch.Overall Score:9.5/10The Good:Great visuals for the genreStrong tutorialInteresting setting (Pacific War) not often explored in gamesDeep gameplay but it doesn't over complicate thingsThe Bad:Although visuals are great for the genre, newer players may find them blandSteep price tag (which tends to come with the genre and niche market)The Ugly:N/A"
76561197972995047,Recommended,312450,18349224,"Posted: 5 October, 2015",all,Coup d' oeil,"Wonderful game. I brought Panzercorps but this is way better.  I'm playing OOB nonstop. Where with Panzercorps, I play only in short burts. I especially like how Order of a Battle implemented supply. Think Unity of Command. Gone is wasting a turn to resupply in the middle of a fire fight like in Panzercorps.  It's abstracted out. As long as you keep your lines,  you are good to fight. The animations are wonderful too. You will be suprised how much enjoyment a well animated unit brings to the game over a static one. The sound is very good as well. The background ambience is well done and mixes well with the great sound effect of the battles. The two knocks are, it is light on content compared to Panzercorps (But  they just  released free dlc and more is on the way).  And the other knock is there 's no steam workshop support, so scenarios made by the community are harder to get, than if it was. Still a great war game that has a lot under the hood"
76561197978301777,Recommended,312450,33656350,Posted: 19 July,all,FistFullOBeer,"Overall, this is a very good turn-based strategy game.  Smaller scoped than Panzer General, but it has the same feel as that archetypal game.  I have only finished the Japanese campaign in the base game, but I have 100 hours playing this so I have an idea how it plays.Pros:The UI is mostly easy to use.  There are times when I want to do something and it takes a few minutes to figure out how to do it, but it seems to have all the functionality I expect.Good visuals, looks like a boardgame.Combined arms tactics are rewardedSound effects are goodThe AI really does a great job of cutting off units from supply.I mention a con below of scripting, but regardless of the scripted nature of the AI's play, it does seem to make really good decisions.I am constantly yelling at the game for being a stupid cheater!  (This is a good thing because it means it is a challenging game. Any game that gets the upper hand gets yelled at for cheating.)Interesting DLCs.  They have a Japanese campaign in China and a German campaign in Europe, but they also have a campaign in Finland, and they are working on one for Burma Road – not the usual WW2 theatres these types of games cover.ConsThere needs to be more information on the unit counter regarding the type of aircraft you are deploying.  For instance, there is a tip that says Heavy Fighters are good against Bombers and Ground Units, Interceptors are good against other small aircraft, etc.  But when you go to purchase a plane, it does not specify what TYPE you are buying. Is this an Interceptor, Heavy Fighter?  You can't tell without studying the specific stats (or just have fantastic knowledge of all planes built by the Japanese in WW2). Why not simply add the aircraft role next to the plane model?  Such as ""AMN552 - Interceptor"" (this is an example, not a real plane model) instead of making players google this information?You can't play both sides in a campaign.  For instance, the Japanese Campaign, you cannot play the Chinese side of this, which is too bad, because it would be interesting to see how that plays out.Scripting - the reason you can't play both sides is because the game is heavily scripted, the AI is not making decisions, it is just following a script and doing things when it is supposed to.  So while this looks and feels great when you first play the game, once you figure out the pacing, the game becomes a little rote.Not a fan of the concealed bunkers - I get that a tank has limited vision and may not see the foxhole, but the infantry unit next to it should.  So moving from one hex to another and suddenly discovering a bunker or foxhole is super aggravating.The AI does not seem to use FOW - it tracks down damaged units with fanatical precision, no matter how far it has been moved.Overall, this game is a great game for anyone who is interested in WW2 strategy games.  I hope they keep developing DLCs to encompass more theatres, I am especially waiting for the North African campaigns and hope they can somehow work it so we can play both sides."
,Recommended,312450,23686785,"Posted: 21 June, 2016",all,Canuck,"This is a fantastic wargame. Ignore the most recent bad reviews from the spoiled brats who want to get a full game for free. This is an awesome beer 'n' pretzels type wargame of the same style as the classic Panzer General but it's far, far better. It's even a level above the more recent Panzer Corps which is also a reimagining of Panzer General. This new version allows you to play the Boot Camp campaign which is 4 or 5 scenarios plus the first scenario out of each DLC which currently stands at 4 so you should have about 8 or 9 scenarios to play for the price of free! Give the game a shot-you won't regret it at all."
,Not Recommended,312450,22774999,"Posted: 3 May, 2016",all,Grimmblut,"Order of Battle: Pacific (OoB:P) has one advantage and one advantage alone over competing titles like Panzer Corps, Panzer General and all the other hex strategy games: The revolutionary supply system. The hex field where a unit is or moves through belongs to the player of that unit. That way you can establish areas that are under your control. If a supply source (a town or a supply ship) is within that area, then the units are in supply and can fight at their full strength. When you cut enemy units of from their supply source by moving one or more of your units through the area, that connects their area with the area of their supply source, then their effective combat strength drops radically. This gives tanks e.g. their realistic operational combat value to cut off enemy units and start a battle of encirclement and annihilation. This is great. This is what I had been waiting for in a game for decades. It opens a completely new dimension of strategy.Sadly, this is the only advantage OoB:P has to offer and there are so many disadvantages that wear this great feature down.The waiting time during the enemy's turn:My PC is using an OC i5, 8 GB RAM and an SSD, along with a pretty good graphics card. The waiting time during some turns can be up to 7 minutes. Attention: I'm not talking about a situation where the enemy has 20 units in close combat with mine and needs to figure out a good tactic. I'm talking about where I can see ONE enemy unit on the map and the AI takes 7 minutes for hidden movement in the fog of war. I've read about other player's who claim to have waiting times of 20 to 30 minutes during each turn. A typical battle lasts about 25 turns, but 50 turns and more is not uncommon. To be fair, 7 minutes is, in my case, the absolute maximum. Most times the AI needs maybe a minute. But when these spikes happen, then they come in a row.Predefined tactics:This is - by far - the worst. It's what made me uninstall the game. The developers obviously don't trust the players. They have a very narrow idea of how a battle should be played, e.g. in which order strategic objects should be captured, where a player should send his units and where he MUST NOT send them (or else he will be punished by, and I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not, SPAWNING huge amount of enemy troops right before his troops to bash them back where the developers think they belong). Other means how this is enforced are, that the player may not bring specifc CORE units into battle or that he's limited to a very small force until he captures a specific location. There are very often AI controlled units in battles, that fight on your side, but which move at scripted events or times to directions that you can't influence, e.g. they wait for 15 turns and do nothing and then move to attack a small island on the map even though you've already cleared that one out. Result: You've waisted time to clear that island (which was supposed to be attacked by the AI controlled allied units - without telling you before) and now you don't have enough time left to complete the rest of the (secondary) objectives, so you have to restart the battle. Because of this, I had to restart about 3/4 of the battles that I've played. It's extremely frustrating.Stupid and cheating AI:I could put up with the extremely long waiting times during the AI's turn if the AI was smart. But it isn't. I had moments like ""Oh no, if this unit moves two hex to the southeast, then it will cut of my units."" But no. Never have I witnessed one single smart move of the AI but A LOT stupid ones. The AI does two things: A) Attack the weakest unit or the one that has already taken the most damage and B) move to the closest victory location. That's it. A higher difficulty level doesn't mean a smarter AI, it just means better combat multipliers for the enemy (more damage to your units, less damage to theirs). The AI also cheats like hell, e.g. an enemy planes uses its maximum range to fly right next to one of your planes, which is at a location where it's guaranteed that the enemy has had no vision, to attack said plane. Fog of war exists only for the player.Exit points on battle maps:This is really the last straw. At some border locations of the map are ""exit points"" where you or the enemy can move units to and remove them from battle. That may sound like a good idea at first, when you have spend all your supply points but realise that you actually don't need a certain unit, so you move it to an exit point and then bring in a better unit from the reserves that helps you more in this situation. But in the campaign, these exit points are exclusively used by the AI to remove - without any need or warning - units from battle that are part of secondary objectives. Like ""Shoot down 5 air plane squadrons"" and after 15 turns or so, all enemy planes are suddenly ""gone"". The most absurd situation was when an enemy carrier literally vanished at open sea in front of three of my torpedo bomber squadrons. Secondary objective: failed. WTF??Ammunition resupply:The resupply system that I've mention in the beginning is good, but it's very, very oversimplified. Your units are either in supply, or they're not. This decides whether they can fight at full strength. You don't need to supply your troops with ammunition, like in Panzer Corps or - heaven forbid! - like in Battle Isle, where you had to control supply units to bring ammo and fuel to the front. The only exception are torpedo bombers and submarines that work in a very strange way: Their torpedos simply ""respawn"" after a few turns. I adore the feature that let's you cut off enemy units from supply, but the rest of the supply system is oversimplified.Bugs:I had no crashes, but several very serious bugs that forced me to reload a scenario up to eight times. I've read that other players encountered even more bugs and had several crashes.Bad modability:It was promoted that the game would be open to modders, but as far as I've read this isn't true. Several critical game files are only editable with unusual special software and there isn't any interface to activate mods in the game except for mods that are distributed directly by the developers.All in all OoB:P was a huge letdown. Some problems may be fixable but the humiliating spoon-feeding regarding ""what should the player do and how can we force him to do exactly that""-attitude of the developers seems to be something that can't be fixed with a patch."

The mechanics are quite familiar to hex-based wargames, but the addition of supply and fatigue mechanics make the game deeper and more interesting.I've been through all the campaigns (some more than once).

76561198007300752,Recommended,312450,19506557,"Posted: 5 December, 2015",all,Blackadar,"Don't read, just go buy it.You're still here? Ok, let's talk about OoB:P. It's simply the best example of a Panzer General-type game since the original (and it may be better than those revered titles). The game is rock-solid and the production values are high (love seeing the troop animations when fighting). But that's not what makes this beer-and-pretzel wargame great. There's three things going for OoB:P that make it the gem it is.(1) Combined warfare - sea, air and land. There are so very few games that combine all 3 of these together into a workable package. Most games of this type focus on Barbarossa or Normandy where your Navy has no real application. OoB:P's focus on the Pacific allows them to focus on all 3 and they do this very well. Some scenarios are navy/air only and some are land/air only but most incorporate all 3 into one large package. As such it offers you some wonderful opportunities to work some combined arms scenarios which other games of its ilk do not.(2) Units - Not too many and not too few. Some games have an overwhelming number of units where it's difficult for the player to keep up. Others have very few units where the game is too limited. This game has a pretty fair number of units and thus you can select the ones that work with your style. My inability to effectively use anti-tank units correctly mans that I don't have to deal with those and instead I can use heavy infantry or light tanks.(3) Scenario Construction - I saved the best for last. Dear Reader, you probably already know there are many games that play similarly to OoB:P. Panzer Corps, for one, is widely recognized as a very good game. In my opinion, this is where OoB:P beats the competition. I always had a difficult time in PC because I felt the maps were too small for the number of units present. The game turns into a giant slugfest with no room for manuever and thus the scenarios become very much a puzzle and less strategic. Conversely, OoB:P's maps are quite large and there's room to move. The opportunity to flank and even attempt wide encirclements are possible. I have yet to play a scenario that felt constricting. It's the careful crafting of the scenarios that make OoB:P the great game it is.The only real complaints from my standpoint is the lack of a branching campaign structure and no voice-overs to introduce the scenario (boring text).Simply put, go look at the hours played in the other reviews. It's not uncommon to see 100 or 200 hours played and thus the game represents a massive value for your money. I'm currently over 20 and I'm not even done with the first campaign. I could easily see myself putting in 100 hours into this great game. So if you're still reading, it's time to get off the pot - go buy this one because you won't regret it. The price may be higher than other games but what's another few bucks if you get double or triple the value (and gaming time) out of it?"

But it has the WORST AI of any game in the genre I have ever played. Not in terms of strategy mind you, in terms of performance. After the first few turns or whenever there are more than 2 dozen or so units on the board, be prepared for 5-10 MINUTE AI turns. This has been an ongoing problem with the game that the devs have been unable to address, to the point were I play a table game or read a book between my turns. Good luck trying to tune performance BTW, setting everything to low does nothing. Turning ""off"" weather effects doesn't even work, they just come back automatically regardless of toggle setting. Until the performance issues are resolved, I can't recommend the game to anyone."

The campaigns consist of about a dozen well-varied scenarios that each take an hour or so to complete.  The campaigns themselves also sport an impressive variety for a game of this type, featuring theaters often ignored in WW2 strategy games.  What other game features campaigns focused on the Winter War in Finland, the ""Forgotten War"" in Burma, and the Battle of the Atlantic, in addition to the standard German/Japanese/American land conquest campaigns?  What's amazing is that most of these campaigns each have their own distinct flavor.Mechanics-wise, the game is reminiscent of Panzer Corps and by extension, that game's inspiration, the venerable Panzer General (which happens to be my all-time favorite strategy game).  It's pretty standard tactical turn-based combat, to be sure, but what really makes it shine is that the same engine integrates land, sea and air combat seamlessly -- better so than any other turn-based game that I can think of.Like its predecessors, OoB gives you a ""core force"" that you shepherd between the scenarios of a campaign.  You're constantly faced with the choice of whether to reinforce your existing units with veteran troops (thus making them more effective), upgrading them with the latest technology, or buying whole new units.  The fact that the choice is often agonizing is a pretty good indication that it's a well-balanced system.I've now played through most of the campaigns at least half a dozen times.  As long as I keep having an hour or so to spare now and then, I'll probably be cycling through them many more times before I tire of it."

As a computer war game, I'd say this is an enjoyable, somewhat light offering that does a good job with what SPI used to call chrome back in the days of paper and cardboard gaming.There are quite a few elements that make the game feel almost like an arcade offering, such as having torpedo planes ""reload"" in flight, and getting rewards in the way of upgrade/reinforcement points for capturing objectives.  To my eye, the simple 1 through 10 step ratings of units seems un-grog,To balance this, traditional concepts like zones of control, bonuses for supported attacks, and supply considerations are present.  It's an odd balance, but with the relatively pleasing graphical presentation that does a good job of imparting the right PTO flavor, it works.  It feels enough like a serious war game to give it a little heft, despite some of the lighter elements.  No one is going to mistake this game for a Grigsby monster, but it's not a History Channel offering, either.Replayablilty seems a little suspect, but there are secondary objectives that will allow for slightly different outcomes.  It could be argued that between the boot camp, US and Japanese campaign and multiplayer options even a once through would give enough game for the asking price, but without knowing how moddable the basic package is I can't say it's going to give endless hours of service without growing stale, but that's asking a lot of any game.I'm having fun with it, the learning curve isn't too steep for the casual wargamer, and it's substantial enough to make you feel like you are playing a ""real"" wargam while being light enough to keep things moving right along.Reccomended  as good casual fun for the serious grognard, or as a dip into deeper waters for those who think of Risk as being pretty complicated."

You do have to take care of units as you only get  certain amount of operational points to use and limited new units to select.It is definitely not War in the East or War in the Pacific but it isn't meant to be a game that plays real time over several years with extreme detail and micromanagement.

Got my first computer at the age of four in 1995, played games with my old man, and I've just never stopped playing the genre.During the years, there's been additions to the not-so-huge genre ( what do we call it? Turn based hexagonal world war two strategy?). Most have all just been pretty much just remakes of Panzer General / Allied General, without bringing much new content.OoB:P does.The setting in the Pacific! Finally!It does not feel like a remake mechanics-wise, everything is a little bit smoother and smarter than it used to be. It does feel like a ""lite"" version sometimes, but it works and it's fresh. The graphics look nice for the genre. I also like the unit abilites (mine-laying, bridge-blowing/repairing, Banzai-charging, Torpedoes etc.).If you ever have liked the genre, you should buy this game. It's excellent. And if you are feeling interested about this type of games, this could be an excellent starting point, as the tutorials and tips help you out a lot if you need it, and everything is smoother and easier to get into than in previous games. Only had time to play 8.8 hours so far, but I've enjoyed every second of it!And just to mention, there is probably a few bugs still here and there, but the only one I've noticed is one where when attacking with the Japanese, some allied units (defeated ones) do not disappear but instead get bugged into the hex, sort of. VERY rare (two times in 8,8h), and has not been a real problem in any way as the unit is in fact, defeated, or at least almost destroyed. Both times it's been Dutch AT-cannon units. I do expect this to be patched, and in general the game runs very well.9/10, I rarely give out 10/10's :)"

I will say the one AI bug the really should fix, the AI is allowed to move/attack and replenish a unit all in the same turn, which of course the player cannot do, you can move and replenish , but not move/attack and replenish, so its kinda a cheat for the AI.

It has all the historical units and the turn-based tactics from the original game, but with more modern graphics and a nice overall feel to the combat.The game features many fun scenarios that approximate the famous battles of the Pacific war. However, one glaring ommission from this game is a true sandbox campaign where you're given command of the entire war effort from start to finish. This games' idea of a campaign is to string along a series of individual missions and carry over some units from one battle to another. That's pretty disappointing to a fan of games with an actual strategy layer like the old PTO.Overall, it's a very promising game, but the lack of a true campaign limits replayability and dampens my enthusiasm for playing much more than a few missions."

The free part simply means that you get to try one of the campaign scenerio's for free and if you like it, buy the DLC. No game is free, you have some costs. Be it time, material or to actually be competative, you need to buy something provided by the game producer.  This game has literally hundreds of hours of playability.

Prefer storming the enemy? Deploy tanks to overwhelm the enemy. Prefer a slower war of attrition? Deploy artillery units that slowly chop down the enemy.-Good dev response - Many issues that were common in the beginning stages of the game development(I have been there) have been fixed speedily.-Opportunities are limitless. If you prefer to stick to the tropical warfare of WW2, try the US Marine Campaign or the imperial Japanese takeover of the Pacific.CONs:-Yes, some of the campaigns in the game require you to pay for DLCs in order to play them. But when I first got the game, know that you had to pay $50 just to play the US and Japanese campaigns. At least now you actually get to try it for free(the tutorial).-Multiplayer support is little to none at times. Sometimes, finding a game is impossible.-Gameplay does get indeed, repetitive. Or if you just prefer clicking on enemy units over and over again, then that's your deal.Overall, it's a great game that I really do enjoy playing. I own all the DLCs except the most recent(Blitzkrieg) and I plan to purchase it in the near future. Once again, yes you do need to buy DLCs in order to play the campaigns, but remember that the game originally was $50 just to play the American and Japanese campaigns. Lastly, if this game seems boring or dull to you, don't bother playing these types of games. It's just not your style."

As well, the Power Ups awarded after some scenarios didn't really help as much as I'd hoped, but perhaps I chose poorly for my gaming style.In fact, the only gripe I have is the last power up for the Japanese - the Kamikaze. Don't pick Kamikaze. They do only ONE damage at most to any unit regardless of the situation.

There are some really cool new features that make the feeling very different. For instance supply is based on a general system of controlled towns and supply ships, not individually anymore. Combined with ""borders"" of your territory a quick push into enemy territory feels and plays much different now.Plus units now have command points (bigger units more command points) and you have to choose which units to bring to a battle - divided into land-, sea- and air-units. That makes it impossible to play killer-airplanes all the time.I personally like the bigger share of naval units and major sea battles.On the downside the AI is still struggling with human intelligence. Carrier based bombers fly without fighter cover (often the fighter plane is there, but two hexes apart), enemy offensives are easily stalled by cleaverly placed mines etc. To benefit the AI it seems that FOW does not really apply to its units. So enemy planes will most often kill off heavily damaged squadrons in the fog and the AI never walks into mines.There are two campaigns - US and Japan - with only one path. No more major and minor victories which change the course of war, but secondary war goals that generate boni like commanders, extra-resources and weaker enemies in the future. I like that approach cause I played for decisive vics anyways. Especially the US-campaing plays quite easy in the end - maybe turn the difficulty up.Commanders (heroes) are less powerful than in ""Panzer Corps"" and can be re-assigned, injured and made POW.I like the little black-and-white photos of events during battles and on the campaign map. Gives the game more feeling.I can recommend this game to every fan of turn-based grand-strategy games. There are some minor bugs, but these don´t feel to bad. Curious to try out the multiplayer mode.

Plays much like the Panzer General/Panzer Corps series, but with much thought and improvements to naval and air power.  Anyone familiar with Slitherine's Afrika Korps expansion to Panzer Corps will see similarities in the linear campaign pathing and mid-scenario events.Gameplay is tactical in an operational environment, meaning your units do not represent combined arms brigades, rather pure all-tank, all-infantry, or all-artillery type units.  This is for fun and has a ""beer and pretzels"" aspect to the gaming.  On the macro picture (strategically), the game is pretty realistic, however.The player must strike a balance between caution and deadlines to reach objectives.  Move in too fast and you will encounter ambushes.  Too methodical and you will run out of time.  This is not the cakewalk of the Panzer General series, and every scenario can be lost if the player is reckless.Also, scenarios are long, as in epic.

If you liked that, you'll very likely enjoy Order of Battle: Pacific. The inclusion of air and sea units really mixes up your tactical options and makes it feel like a whole new game. You can soften up land units with your ships before doing a beach landing. The addition of supply also adds another new layer and something to be considered. You can't just charge ahead into enemy territory without risking being cut off. So, a bit more of everything without tipping over into being bogged down by too much detail or too many dry and unnecessary mechanics.I'd say this is very much a game for those who like the idea of wargames but are put off by the larger scope of the more traditional and more 'serious' type of wargame. When you get right down to it, it really is just a medium weight puzzle game with a military coat of paint.While I like Panzer Corps, I always felt a little intimated by it. Strangely, while being slightly more complex, OABP feels much more accessible, more varied and more immediately fun. Strongly recommended to those who like the idea of wargames but don't want to cross over into the deep and serious territory. Easily worth its full asking price."

I just wish my macbook pro 2010 was more powerful for me to play the game in a better resolution and with more fast AI. I suppose that can interfere in that too. An advice for the developers and people of Artistocrats: do use the lua programming language for AI. It's fast and very easy to use that way. I think it was made on Unity, so the AI must've been made on top of Unity's common languages. That's more CPU demanding, I think. Yeah, I'm a programmer and I love games that are tactical like that.

This is at best a limited tactical game, with limited interface and options.The unit deployment and structure is weak, substandard in fact.  On the one hand I have a fleet with 10.000+ men in the ships and then some ground unts, with what looks like well, the size unknown, are they companies? battalions?  squads? Divisions?  Not clear.

Then, I thought, I'd try out my 1st campaign as the Imperial Japanese.   I can't believe how puny and undramatic the opening battle of WWII for the U.S. vs. Japan was portrayed here.  Seriously.  I had about 6 planes TOTAL, plus 1 I bought.  The U.S. Navy had 3 battleships and 3-4 smaller vessels in port in this scenario.  Sorry, but I expected something more historical, along the lines of what inflamed the fires of American patriotism that day.  TONS of enemy planes sinking/damaging TONS of unprepared/ill-equipped US vessels and property.  This scenario was a BIG disappointment.MAJOR HISTORICAL ERROR:  Surely by now, someone else has noticed how the 40's-era commercial announcer says, ""Once a Marine, Always a Marine.  Semper ""feeee.""  That made me puke just a little bit.  It's FI/pronounced ""FYE,"" as in Semper Fidelis, ""Ever/Always Faithful!""  Semper ""feeeeee""?  Almost a deal-breaker, folks.The opening panel artwork is atrocious as well.  I saw what I believe was intended to be a Colt 1911 .45 U.S. military-issue side arm with some rounds to the side of it?  The artist's conception made it look more like a cross between a Browning High-Power 9mm (especially the anaemic bullets to the side of it) and an emaciated Desert Eagle.I'm guessing that most players will be comparing this to the offerings in the Panzer Corps line and/or Battle Academy.  Of the 3, this comes in dead last so far.  It reminds me of WWI type games where it takes way too many moves to accomplish anything.Only one real game into a ""campaign"" that cost $40 and I'm having doubts about what kind of military research was done other than to feature true battles that actually occurred in history.I DO appreciate the fact that SOMEONE has taken on the conflict in the Pacific over the European theatre for a change, though.  5 Stars for that!  Sadly, STEAM will only allow you to +/- this game with no wiggle room so I must say that, at this point in time, I would not recommend this game....unless you willing to take the only offering of WWII Pacific Theatre action out there.Hopefully, I'll be revising this review in a more positive light soon.
