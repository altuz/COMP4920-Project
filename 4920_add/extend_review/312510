Now imagine being almost invulnerable while charging, as well as being able to destroy blocks. By now you should feel very mobile and with new exciting combat-options to explore.This fun can be combined with up to three friends in four different, yet equally entertaining modes of competitive multiplayer.While this game isn't heavy on content and extras by any means, it really struck me and my friends by its quality: the gameplay feels fresh, well balanced and highly dynamic, the presentation feels coherent and quite stylish, the menus are very easy and effective to navigate.If you like your games to to be fun, direct, unique and with a little challenge, you should get this game."

Multiplayer does not have the same replayability as single player for me. It would greatly benefit from some more modes, and the ability to play co-op. I have only tried 2-player though, and the arena feels a bit too big for 2-player, so it is probably more fun with 3 or 4 players. Don't get me wrong; despite these shortcomings, the multipayer is a lot of fun! It's just not quite as good as it could have been.Here's my gameplay video of World 1:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRbhZEYNP9s"

I would recommend it as a party game if you pick it up on sale, otherwise you could do a lot better for $15."

The first one is a single player campaign and the other one is a 2-4 players VS mode. The VS mode is a great way to have a laugh with friends. the controls and gameplay are solid. the sounds and graphics look in a good retro way.My only problem was that the game is nice but it advertises itself (and its the steam system fault) having Local Co-op, when in reality it has the VS mode...A very nice game overall."
76561198085189433,Recommended,312510,15835464,"Posted: 15 May, 2015",all,Azeal,"Mega Coin Squad is an original and entertaining local multiplayer game with loads of replayability.Each game is composed of several rounds of randomly chosen (or create your own playlist) game modes. In between each round you get character powerups based on your rank in the last game.The game modes consist of a simple deathmatch, a mode where you have to collect and bank the most coins, hold the rainbow for a certain amount of time, or collect a set number of megacoins (that spawn one at a time) and bank them to win. These modes are all quite different and fun.Mega Coin Squad is a very nice addition to any local multiplayer lineup.Subscribe to my curator page for more local multiplayer recommendations:http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7189360/Check out my Couch Gaming group for specials, bundles, etc:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CGLM"
,Recommended,312510,12181483,"Posted: 21 September, 2014",all,Cryoton,Good game. Very fun. Good if you like collecting a lot of items. The only problem is that the difficulty spike is too much. You hit the 3rd world and it's just stupidly hard for no reason whatsoever. Not fun when you die over and over and over and over again.

,Recommended,312510,16631448,"Posted: 22 June, 2015",all,Dizzy,"This game feels like something you'd play on the GBA. There's a lot of polish, it's easy to pick up and play, it's colorful, and it has catchy music. It might be hard to find someone to play multi with, but for what it's worth, the single player is actually pretty fun by itself."

Plus it's actually fun and rewarding when you do save money!  Unlike in real life.  I wish saving REAL money was as enjoyable as this...."

The price is a bit up there though and the replayability is lacking. Overall could use more variety, but as it stands it is a very soundly built game with a comfortable control scheme."
,Recommended,312510,29580300,Posted: 29 January,all,dudeanonymous,"Fun and short little platformer. Nothing super outstanding about it. I would not have paid 15 bucks for it. I picked it up on sale. Definitely worth it if you can pick it up for a few bucks, but don't waste a lot of money on it."
76561198393397552,Not Recommended,312510,34385047,Posted: 20 August,all,rock.golem | trade.tf,I would like to review the game but unfortunately all I can say about it is that when I launch the game all I get is a black screen with an FPS counter in the upper left corner. This black screen runs at 250 frames per second... Apparently this happens a lot according to the forums so.....watch out for that. This is the only relevant I can give you all I'm afraid. I would not recommend this game to anyone unwilling to go through a troubleshooting process or the steam refund system. As there is a chance you will be stuck with a game that does not work.
76561198025081981,Recommended,312510,34182607,Posted: 11 August,all,etherspin,"EDIT : I just finished it and was abruptly disappointed by the length of the game, still worth it for a buck and a half on special but before reading my review be aware that the quality I talked about only lasts for about four brief worlds with a few levels each. Because the map layout is reminiscent of Super Mario World I thought there might be several times as much, so I've finished this in a couple of hours and enjoyed every minute but want more levels please Devs!this and Super Puzzle whatever from Adult swim are absolutely amazing.they have the best of the feel of top tier SNES and TurboGrafx puzzle and platform games but with some obvious capabilities beyond those systems so they also feel a little bit like NeoGeo arcade machines from that era.My play time on here is borked cause I had something come up when I'd left the game paused on the computer last night so I've probably played about 2 hours split between two characters so I can't say yet if Mega Coin squad has any value for replay or actual hours put in before you are finished but based on how much I've enjoyed it so far I can't fault it.the graphic style is of course retro pixel art but not lifted from any one game and the platforming has elements of metal slug, Mario and sonic.the charming style of the game frequently deceives me into relaxing for a bit when actually you need to be on your toes as its fast paced and challengingworth the price I got it for already (1.50 USD on special)"
