,Recommended,312560,26407238,"Posted: 3 November, 2016",all,Asymphonic,You know what I miss? Squaresoft ps1 era RPG's.I bought this game on a whim because I heard it had interconnecting level design and saw that it was an action rpg with block puzzles. After about 2 hours with the game it certainly delivered those things.They premise of the story and Lore seems a little lackluster and contrived for the sake of game mechanics but the combat and skill system feel right at home with most oldschool rpg's and it feels like there will be no small amount of dungeon crawling in the future and its here where this game is going to shine.Well worth the 20 bucks and would recommend to anyone who's nostalgic over old school rpg's.

The D-pad moves the cursor to select items within the tab, to change the actual tab, you need to use the left stick. When in the merchant interface, it doubles as the mouse. So you can use the stick as the mouse and the d-pad for fine tuning your selection.Ive never played Xanadu when it came out all those years ago, but iv heard fond tales and whispers of this game through out the years, over the internet or from friends. Im so excited to finally have a chance to play it!The music is good, almost too good, in the sense it feels like its been ripped right from zelda and remixed, ahaha. Thats not a bad thing and shouldnt be taken as one.the fighting is cool, monsters ive seen so far, they wind up attacks and generally dont turn while attacking, allowing you to side step and swoop in from the side or back. The game actually encourages you to do so. Swinging your weapon doesnt only attack what you have directly infront of you, so if theres 2 enemies- one in front and one slightly right or left, your sword,axe,etc. swing will hit both of them. This is something a lot of ARPG's dont do (or you have to unlock it as a skill).I cant really say much about the story, I mean the dialog is pretty decent. its hardly cheesy or cringey, as a lot of japanese rpg games can be (imo anyways). you of course play the silent protag, but they give some story as to why that is- which is just one of those little things that I appreciate.Anyways, wether you never played it or are coming back for a second or third time. the game is worth the full $20 (17.99 launch price). I can tell just from the 2 hours n' change ive played. I can say whole heart, You will know within the FIRST hour if youll want to continue playing the game, as refund is an option an you definitely have 2 hours game time to decide.Enjoy!"

Xanadu Next is a 3D hack n slash RPG that kinda reminds me of Vagrant Story, but without taking turns.  There are several dungeons, lots of travel in between, various puzzles and puzzle items reminiscent of Zelda, lots of tough boss battles, and a lot of mystery.  It's honestly a fantastic title that anyone could enjoy and if you HAVEN'T played any of the Ys games, do yourself a favor and check them out after reading this review."

Combat's methodical, skills are used more sparingly, loot and dungeons are all fixed. You earn new abilities that let you progress Zelda/Metroid style as well as find secrets where you've already been.Some light grinding. Free-form stat assignment is sort of deceptive as you generally end up just building towards requirements for new equipment, although it might be possible to do more of a ""wizard"" build. Equipment is reflected on your character model, which is satisfying. Good music. Not particularly story heavy although there is lore if you want it. Varied environments. Well-designed boss fights.I'm using an Xbox 360 pad (which doesn't seem to be rebindable at all? but defaults are ok) and you pretty much have to use a mouse as well to navigate inventory, shops, and menus. KB+M probably works fine."
76561198037917342,Recommended,312560,31719091,Posted: 13 May,all,「SUPER EUROBEAT」,"Great game to pick up if you like the Ys series, and a great value as well. This game will keep you busy for a while, and manages to remain fresh throughout. This game could be described as a slower, more methodical, puzzle-heavy Ys. I would also argue that it is more difficult than the Ys games (at least the ones available on Steam). The puzzles are hard and the combat has been slowed down and made much more punishing, forcing you to be deliberate in your actions, a noticeable departure from the super fast hack and slash style of Ys.The game is paced beautifully. The game has several factors in play that will make it apparent to the player that they need to go back to town to buy new gear, or that they need to level up, or learn a new ability. It all feels very organic and natural, never forced. There is a consistent feeling of progression present throughout the game. Character growth is almost a mini game in itself, you are constantly looking for the best way to optimize your character against the ever-stronger enemy horde.The story is take it or leave it. If you've played The Oath in Felghana, you already know the story for this game. It's generic, but it does a decent job of telling you why you are doing what you're doing. There is some lore and backstory but I'm not the kind of person to delve into that stuff. It's there if you want it.My only problems stem from the controls and some of the design choices. The game needs a mouse to be playable, which is a pain if you play with a controller like I do. You need a mouse to navigate your inventory, and since you are in an out of it all the time, it gets annoying having to switch back and forth constantly. This is related to my other gripe which is that some of the key items and abilities in the game should have just been passive abilities. There is no reason you would ever want to not use them, yet they still require being equipped in an item slot or skill slot to use. It would save a ton of inventory swapping time if they were simply always on, since slot space is limited and will almost always be occupied by something else.Overall this game is great and I would recommend it to people looking for a puzzle-y action RPG with combat that isn't (totally) braindead and puzzles that will truly challenge you. The game starts out a little rough, but eventually the weird design choices will make sense and you will realize that the game is better for them. Definitely one of those games that you start playing and then realize 6 hours have passed."

Alright.If I had to sum it up with one sentence, I'd sayit's a Falcom gameXanadu Next is an incredibly fun and incredibly satisfying game, that just feelsrighton every level.Originally released in 2005 it was just now properly localized and touched up with the usual stuff like Steam achievements, widescreen support etc, like the Trails in the Sky and Ys games.It's like a slightly slower and more RPG-heavy Ys game with an interconnected world and lots of secrets to find. Combat is fast, but heavily emphasizes positioning and the feedback is incredibly satisfying.The story is very interesting as well, and while it may seem unimportant and perfunctory at most in the beginning, it builds up to a stunning conclusion.It's really an amazing game."
76561198156231391,Recommended,312560,30030716,Posted: 19 February,all,tenlinkedparts,"One of Falcom's best games. I first played this years ago, when all we had was a fan patch.Xanadu Next is a very different beast from their Ys offerings, having some Diablo here and some Zelda there. It is a rare example of a traditional ARPG that's controlled with the mouse and keyboard instead of a game controller! The game also acknowledges those willing to push it to its limits, which is one of the bigger reasons I think it's so great.The stat system is interesting, being similar to certain RPGs where you pick the stats you want as you level up, but giving you a loose guide with equipment requirements. You can switch your chosen stats around until you level up again, and you can even level down if you're dissatisfied with what you picked (you will eventually discover two other reasons for leveling down)! Weapons gain experience from use, and you are even rewarded with skills through becoming proficient with each weapon the game has to offer. There are also equippable Guardians, spirits which grant you a variety of boosts and abilities, and also grow stronger with experience.Next is rather dark in tone compared to many of ""Neo Falcom""'s other titles, joining the likes of Dinosaur Resurrection (please please please XSEED). It uses full 3D models for everything instead of the chibi pre-rendered sprites of Ys; this also allows for fully visible equipment, which is always a treat. There's a lot of storyline packed into here; Next is not directly related to any other Xanadu game, so there's no need to worry about playing previous Xanadu or Dragon Slayer games (though you definitely should, especially The Legend of Xanadu). Despite the main character not having an official name, he has a lot of backstory that ties into the world's somewhat bleak post-war situation. As with other Neo Falcom games, all NPCs are named and have a lot to say over the course of the game.Not a lot of contention from me, and definitely nothing that fundamentally detracts from the game. I don't care too much for the music aside from a few specific tracks, but that means nothing to the game as a whole, and it's not like I turn the music off at any point. I wish there were various difficulty levels, but the one difficulty we get is pretty well-designed. This release has a few minor bugs, but nothing major; besides, XSEED is very good about fixing things year after year, and it should be understood that they're a small company constantly swamped with work.All in all, it's a game I have no problem paying $19.99 for, and you shouldn't either. One day, I'd like to have the original physical release to put on a shelf."

The story actually starts out surprisingly decent (though it seems like it has fallen off a bit now that I'm in the first real dungeon, but one event actually caught me off guard), and the combat is quite good. It feels satisfying AND forces you to make a lot of strategic choices. For example, one enemy explodes and hits every creature in the room, including yourself, when you kill it. Another enemy goes down far easier with magic, but can be killed with melee attacks if you're low. And magic reliably damages enemies that you're too weak to defeat in melee, but is VERY limited (i.e. you have to recharge in town or use MP restoratives, which aren't sold in shops, to get more spell charges).And related to that, stats make a HUGE difference in this game... I went from only doing 1 damage against certain enemies and the first real boss to 1 - 3 shotting the enemies and having an actual chance against the boss simply by allocating all my level up points for one level into attack.Death hurts in this game, and the difficulty is no joke. You lose every unimportant item you were carrying plus 50% of your gold. The only save point I've seen thus far is in town, but after you get a certain item, you can warp back to town any time you like, plus there's moderately expensive Diablo style portals you can buy on top of that that'll take you back to where you stopped, so there's quite the risk vs. reward system going on.People who like lore in their games will love this. You collect tablets and journals, your companion translates them for you, and once translated, you get to read up on some of Xanadu's history....Oh and, oddly enough, the game seems designed with keyboard and mouse in mind. You click and your character (who's default name is Falcom, so I can only assume they REALLY want you to name him either after yourself, or with a fancy name of your own making) goes there like in a PC hack and slash game. I think you can use controllers, though the store's page says ""partial controller support,"" and given what that often means, I haven't brought myself to try it yet.So yeah. Even if the rest of the game sucks, and I don't think it will, I'm glad Falcom, XSeed, and Marvelous brought this game over. I'd love to see more older RPGs like this that we didn't get back in their heyday.UPDATE: Tried the controller.  Actually worked mostly fine for me using an Xbox 360 controller.  Only issue is, by default, you have to hold down the start button to use the mouse for navigating your equipment menu.  The game still feels like it was designed purely with a keyboard and mouse in mind when it came out back in 2005, but a controller does have certain advantages, like having a single button for using items instead of four, and not having to ""aim"" the cursor at enemies.I also have run into some mild bugs, but nothing gamebreaking like some people are saying, just minor text bugs (seemed to happen when I used the default name of ""Falcom"" for some reason, restarting and using an original name seemed to fix it), and a weird graphical glitch in one room that quickly went away.I've heard of more serious things happening, but haven't run into them myself, so I cannot comment on them.  I'll just say, be aware that there might be issues.I still highly recommend the game though.  The gameplay is incredibly satisfying.  The combat just feels great, and the way you explore in this game is extremely well done, unlocking bits of the island and its dungeons piece by piece."

The game plays like a mix of Zelda and Diablo in the Xanadu universe and that is a good thing!  I love the music and the game flows perfectly.  It's basically everything I'd hoped for it to be.

It's a very fun lore-heavy action-RPG with big dungeons, a couple of challenging puzzles and a neat skill system. Atmospheric and challenging, but easy to learn and never unforgiving.This version has some issues though. Aside from some bugs the biggest problem is that the game is not optimized for controller use. You can play the entire game with a controller, but I recommend to have a mouse nearby to navigate through menus. Equipping weapons, armor, items and skills in particular is very inconvenient with a controller and nearly impossible during battles which can't be paused.But overall I really recommend Xanadu Next. It's a unique Falcom gem that delivers 12~20 hours of great gameplay and lore even 10+ years after its original release. Graphics, technical stuff and cutscene presentation aside, it has aged very well."

Finished the game yesterday. They really made the mixture work. It doesn't even resemble Diablo to 100%. The combat system is a hybrid of Ys & Diablo I'd say. Through clever positioning you can get a lot of mileage in this game.The skill & stat system is also different. Through leveling of weapons you unlock their given skills. That means you have to switch weapons a lot, if you want to have a lot of selectable skills! Only the unlocking of spells resembles Diablo 1, which is done by reading Books you can find or buy in shops. The Stats are also negligible most of the time. Your weapons and armor are the only things which dictate your character development. Not much variation on that end.But there's no need for that to be honest. Xanadu Next is a story driven game, as usual with games made by Falcom, with interesting puzzles, dungeons and boss fights.

You'll get used to its controls really quick.Despite being old, this game is really fun to play. There were a couple of perplexing puzzles.

The dungeons also don't feel quite so wonderfully dark and claustrophobic as VS when you have to trudge back out every time you gain a level to go spend your stat points in town.Ultimately though, it's a pretty great adventure, and a fantastic update to another old cult hit from Falcom."

Graphically, it's correct, but that's not what you seek when you play a Falcom game.The OST is awesome, this isn't the thing you'll hear much from Falcom Sound Team JDK, it's calmer and somehow, darker. But this game has one of my favourites boss theme from them.Length is correct, I played this for 15 hours but the game counter was about 9h50 (I died a ♥♥♥♥ing lot because I was not careful about my health, and too greedy to take potions...)Story is good, and there's not as much text as you can expect, so it's kinda a fair deal.There's still something that can bug you out... I don't know who's got the idea to design those boxes puzzles, but that's sadistic, if you play with Keyboard/Mouse. Sometimes you'll end up destroying the crate you just slashed once in the middle of a difficult puzzle = You'll have to enter the room and do it again from roots.The price is really worth it, and I really prefer this game over some Diablo, mainly because this isn't a game in where you have to constantly seek for better loot.It's more like Ys, with a Diablo gameplay.

It certainly turned out to be a fantastic game, but nothing like what I expected.  It's an action RPG, but that's about where the similarities to Ys ends.  Xanadu Next focuses much more on dungeon crawling and exploration, and the atmosphere is relatively dark.  Much of the story and world history is revealed through texts you find hidden in treasure chests throughout the game, some hidden quite well.  I found it incredibly addictive to search every corner of every dungeon looking for secrets, hidden treasures, and discovering more of the game's lore.  The level-up system is very open ended, giving 6 points to allocate to your stats however you please for each level you gain.  The game guides you with equipment stat requirements, so it's pretty hard to mess up your stats, but there is also a level-down option in the case that you want to level up again and redistribute your stats.  The game uses mouse controls, which I'm generally not too fond of, but it functions well and even adds a bit to the feel of the game, so it's not so bad as I expected it would be.

I used a controller, but it seems like it is also designed to be played with a mouse and keyboard like a traditional diablo-style game. Although, it's heavily based around precise movement, so an analog stick may be the way to go.The dungeon crawling is fine, but the surprising thing is the writing.

To my knowledge it's the first to make it to the west curtosy of xseed and nihon falcom.The only thing i knew about this game was it was alot like ys and im a huge fan of that series so i jumped in pretty much right away.To my pleasent suprise not only is this like ys it's a lot harder then ys. I've seen people compare this game to dark souls. It's not exzactly that hard but it's difficult enough. It is basically a top down action rpg dungeon crawler. With some added puzzels. I am pleased to say that i solved 95% of the puzzles (so far) with out using a guide.there are some hard ones in areas that will make you think. aside from that there are obviously items weapons and armor in the game the more you progress the stronger equipment you can use. I made the mistake of buying equipment. Don't unless you need to you can find pretty much everything you need hidden away somewhere cleaver.Of course you need to be strong enough to equip the weapon and have a certain number of points in a certain stat which i like it makes you picka nd choose your stat upgrades carefully. You can't just put every point in brute strength. Well i am sure you could but thats up to you.Music wise as always from a falcom game it is excellent every tune you will end up humming as you play through especially the main theme.The big question is it worth it. Of course Pretty much anything nihon falcom and xseed put out is an instant buy.

If you like older school Action RPG's with a good amount of puzzle elements (Alundra comes to mind.) you will find this game to be a very good purchase.Admittedly if you're looking for a title that will take you ages to play, this won't be it. I had (and a relatively slow one at that) clear time of about 10 hours over the course of a couple days of constant playing. That being said the entire story, progression and gameplay remained tight knit and very cohesive. This is something that many more modern games seem to lack. There's a lot of good continuity throughout the entire gameworld, and you really feel yourself progressing as you unlock shortcuts in the games many ruins and dungeons, and turn some of the almost impossible enemies to beat into easy farming grounds for XP and skills.Though the narrative in the games story is relatively light, there's enough there to keep you interested in between finding tablets and memoirs scattered throughout the game world to what little snippets of story you get through the many characters you meet throughout the journey. It is a good story, albiet a simple one.The gameplay is very good. The unlockables, collectables, and hidden secrets will keep even your third, fourth or fifth run through a particular part of a dungeon interesting as you search for clues or look for ways to use new items you uncover to traverse the many nooks and crannies found in the world.Overall, this is a good intro into the older 3d action RPG's of the ps1-ps2 era. It's got enough challenge but it's definitely beatable by a casual gameplayer as well. Definitely recommend this."

Undoubtedly worth the purchase if you are a fan of these kind of games.--As for my actual review, I will try to brisk over the good and bad points I feel worth sharing after a short description of what the game has to offer.Xanadu is a traditional JRPG dungeon crawler. You'll fight thousands of enemies, explore a massive world filled to the brim with secrets, treasures and detail while you journey through the game's narrative and unravel the mystery behind its story.+ The combat is very fast paced and surprsingly tactical. You'll find that certain enemies are easier to take down using certain skill loadouts, equipment, and maneuvers. Enemies themselves will not blindly attack you until your health drops either, they will frequently re-orient themselves to guard their flank, maintain a distance while hurling spells at you or pool about you in groups. This makes combat constantly entertaining, and rewarding, when you finally begin to take out foes with ease and stealing their loot.+ Boss battles are presented in my favorite blend of puzzle solving, quick whit and sheer epicness. From the bosses I have encountered thus far, each are very distinctive with varried personalities, forms, and abilities. Taking them down is a treat, accompanied by a unique score during each battle.+ The sound and score are both very, very well done. Soundtracks will range from eerie and orchestral to booming and chaotic and I feel each area's soundtrack suits it very well. The sound effects that come off your attacks and abilites are extremely well suited to the game and really make you feel like you're cleaving an enemy in half or burning them to cinders with your fireball spell.+ The story, while starting off only somewhat cliche, begins to unravel into something much more complex and intricate, as the plot is surprisingly deep and the world being full of lore. You'll encounter dozens of memorable characters while taking part in the narrative. Everything is slowly presented to you in small, but occasionally large, bits, but it never feels overwhelming and keeps you engaged, even more so later on as you'll be kept on your toes wondering what will happen next. It should also be noted that the dialogue and lore is *extremelly* well written and a treat in and of itself.+The word is massive and varried. Beautiful, lush forests and dark, dangerous caverns aren't even the beginning of where your boots will take you. Even for such a massive game, a staggering 2400+ areas, you'll find there is very rarely ever a lack of detail as connected areas feel cohesive and unique. Not to mention the hundreds of hidden troves you can find with treasure just waiting to be found.- The keyboard and mouse controls are extremely comfortable, but I cannot recommend using a controller whatsoever. Navigating the menus is too dificult unless you play with a mouse off-hand but at that point I'd recommend just using your mouse.- I know some people have had issues with having this game launch or run efficiently and while I have not had any problems with this myself, it should be noted.In conclusions, Xanadu Next is shaping up to be one of the best games I've played in the last few years. I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys roleplaying games and doesn't mind age factoring in to a games quality. I would easily give this a 9.5/10."

They are in search of a mythical castle known as Castle Strangerock. This journey brings them to a town which ends up being the main hub of the game. Around the town lie ruins, forests, mountains and much more for you to explore.If you like Action RPGs, you need to play Xanadu Next! I've never heard of it myself until it was released on steam and I simply picked it up out of curiousity. It blew me away and I've been addicted to it since.There was some issues on itial release but around 5 patches got released within minutes of the game releasing on steam. The team were actively searching for issues that users were encountering with the game and hot patching them instantly. It was amazing to see such a swift response in this day and age.I mainly used an Xbox 360 controller to play the game. It works nicely but has an issue with the Inventory (all controllers do). The original Xanadu Next from 2005 had no controller support at all, so this was esentially patched onto the the game. The inventory still looks for a mouse control which is something the team haven't been able to overcome yet. Thankfully they implemented a way around this. There is a button on the 360 controller you can hold to begin emulating a mouse, it's a bit awkward but it gets the job done. Honestly, it works perfectly with a Steam Controller and I highly recommend using a Steam Controller if at all possible.The graphics are date now in 2016 but there are methods to sharpen them. A quick google search of ""Xanadu Next Nvidia Inspector"" should bring you to a Neogaf thread where users are attempting to gain the best visuals possible from the game.All in all, I HIGHLY recommend Xanadu Next to users who love Action RPGs.Here is a short list of games I would compare it to:- Dark Souls Series (especially in terms of difficulty)- Baldurs Gate: Dark Alliance Series- Vagrant Story- Diablo Series (without the massive amount of loot and less enemies)"

I'm sort of working through their catalogue at the moment. Some take an adjustment period before they really unfold themselves, such as Brandish.Xanadu Next isn't one of those games for which the player needs an adjustment period. It's a particularly enjoyable synthesis of Ys and the Diablo games. It's a part of the relatively vague Dragon Slayer series, loosely connected titles that share the same general backstory and not much else, particulary a spinoff of Dragon Slayer II, which was never localized in the US for interesting reasons.Nice varied set of weapons with a per-weapon experience mechanic, characters with which I actually formed an attachment, great music and lots and lots of gameplay for your dollar. Runs great as well. I will say that the hand-drawn art, where it appears, is inconsistent in style, which would probably be my only issue."

Upon leveling, you can choose what stats to level which determines what you can equip among other things. There's several skills you get in this game that do different things and the combat in the game is incredibly fun. Furthermore, there's a good amount of enemy variety and the game puts up a good challenge. This game like Dark Souls 1 has a interconnected world with shortcuts everywhere, but also lots of metroidvania elements. For example, you might find a Gauntlet item that allows you to break walls that are weak leading to hidden passageways and cool hidden items. Only flaws I can say for the game is that it has a mostly good soundtrack, but it could have been a little better. There's also too many puzzles in the game that are box puzzles and it can get a tiny bit repetitive. Other then that though, this is an incredibly good game. I would say it's one of my favorite games developed by Falcom."

From the Ys side, you get the real-time combat, the coarse stat system, and the way tools open up new areas (which older Xanadu titles share).The music is most in-line with Trails in the Sky FC's more subdued folksy and aggressive Prog sides, hitting some incredibly soaring or daring highlights. It was a delight entering into new areas and getting the game's music get more ominous and more bold with tempo and time signatures. Great selection.Loved, loved, LOVED the last dungeon. Huge, intricate, full of secrets, puzzles, loot, shortcuts and plain clever design, I can't for the life of me cant figure out why so little of the company's later output can't hit this game's work. Maybe they don't work there any more?I liked the localization here; it was calm and carefully chosen. A real treat for the eyes.There are a couple of small problems befitting old J-PC coding though: renaming our protagonist friend here causes lines of text to vanish, a crash happened, and a few minor problems.But these are nothing too serious.

,Recommended,312560,30227403,Posted: 27 February,all,Frozen Softserve 🍦,"I picked this game up due to its pedigree: I love every Ys game, no matter how different, and Falcom is generally a go-to company for me in general.Xanadu Next didn't wind up disappointing. I'm glad it was localized, after all of these years. Sure, that means the graphics are dated (although they still do have a level of charm to them), but every other aspect of it still holds up if you're into the genre. It nails the same stuff most Falcom games do: music, gameplay and a great sense of progression.Gameplay is, I suppose, similar to Diablo. If you're playing with a mouse, you walk around by clicking and attack by clicking. You can also use a controller, which I think makes the combat more satisfying, but simultaneously makes dealing with the menus more annoying. So I'd recommend sticking with the mouse.You wander around dungeons killing things, finding treasure, accessing new areas and beating bosses. You have a fairly standard leveling up system, which gives you points to distribute among stats. Beyond the obvious, these stats affect which equipment you can use (and it's in your best interest to spend them wisely because of that). You can also learn skills by using certain weapons for a while, which leads to quite a variety of abilities -- some of which are easily missable because not all weapons are just found in obvious chests or a shop.The dungeons are generally well designed, although some are a bit too mazelike for my liking. Each requires keys to advance, which you can either purchase or make yourself with a special item and resources. When you get to the end of one, you'll generally find a boss. The boss fights are all pretty entertaining and each has its own weaknesses. I found these to be one of the highlights of the game, but at times the control system makes it hard to react as quickly as you'd like -- there will be times where you're meaning to click on a boss's weak part that suddenly shifts, leading you to walk there instead. Some of the later bosses are also quite difficult, although that's to be expected.The game itself is pretty long. I spent around 35 hours on it and that doesn't include 100%ing the map, finding all of the skills, etc. I found it compelling enough to keep going -- I played it almost exclusively until I finished it. The storyline helped too: much of it is optional (you find texts and read them), but what's there is solid even if not overly complex.I do have my problems with the game, but they're mostly personal preferences. Japanese Action RPGs seem to love having at least one ""lost woods"" section where you have to go in specific directions in an area or else it resets. I'm very tired of that. I also didn't really care for the item that makes invisible things visible -- the game has visual cues for this, but in many cases it just felt like an excuse for me to backtrack hoping I could remember where I saw sparkles hours before.Overall, though, I would recommend this game to people who like dungeon crawlers, grinding stats, action RPGs or Falcom games."

Much of the same feel, including a mute hero, a classic action-rpg feel, and equipment of various kinds that can gain experience and level up on their own. Unfortunately the music couldn't hold a candle to what could be found in Ys, the graphics were uglier than lower-bit Ys games, and the character felt clunkier. Particularly painful was the lack of a jump button - you could move, attack, or use a special attack in real-time. Not enough 3D movement!I wasn't quite loving the game, but then I did some research. Xanadu is actually the opposite of a Ys knockoff - it is the predecessor to Ys, created by the same company. It seems that earlier versions of this game feel like a classic action-rpg because they literally defined what it meant to be an action-rpg, and ""classic action-rpg"" refers to this game and similar.Despite the historical importance of this game, it just isn't a match for many of the games that followed it. The newer Ys games are a far better version of Xanadu, made by the same company with decades of experience refining their games."

But most importantly, the game just isn't fun. I unfortunately cannot get a refund since I exceed the playtime but I would get  one if I could.This will be the last game I buy from steam."

Really fun and engaging gameplay, fun system, replayability, side content to complete.It does feel a bit old from time to time and the graphics are quite ugly but that doesn't detract from the fun.It's just a great game, one that you would expect from Falcom."

Fantasic music, challenging bosses, fun skills system, strong atmosphere, and great level design.  It's a bit rough around the edges, the character models are pretty low detail and the controls (particularly with a gamepad) can be a little archaic but I'd still highly recommend it.  It's easily one of my favorite ARPGs on steam"
