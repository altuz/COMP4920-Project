Not at full price.People talk here like it's ""Like Final Fantasy Tactics or the Fire Emblem or Disgaea"". Well they are not completely wrong, but they are not right from another point of view.Everything I will say, is according to my playthrough (2 floors cleaned 6,5 hours played on hard difficulty), achievement analysis, and screenshot analysis.Lets talk in numbers.4 Floors.5 levels each.20 levels (game stages total).3 ""starting"" professions.Warrior upgrade goes like x3 (second) x1 (third) = 7Archer goes like x2 x3 = 9Magician goes like x2 x2 = 7So it's 23 professions to choose from, not bad huh ?Yep but this are the all the enemy you will encounter in the game (+3 plot dolls who just useless but have high HP).There are no more enemy types in game.No gear. Trere are NO items or potions. No inventory. Just skills.There 6 types of magick. Guide staits that Fire->Lightning->Water->Fire and Dark->Light->Star->Dark. But trere is no elements on the characters (exept buffs), so for the most time it is just like ""hit the mage with fisical, hit the warrior with magic to win).Difficulty ?Total maximum of your characters are 20.In batle you can use 5, with no replacement.There are 10-15-20 enemies, you should fight with 5 of your dudes.No item difference, no profession difference, no skill difference ever. Plus you often start in terrible position (like group separated). Of course it's difficult, but it is just ""zerg rush"" you see.Here my playtime with it if you need more proof.http://www.twitch.tv/drobodur/c/5712990http://www.twitch.tv/drobodur/c/5712997"
,Not Recommended,312600,14387420,"Posted: 8 February, 2015",all,fuzzfas,"In short: It's a semi-competent SRPG with some odd design choices, grindy and tedious progression, and charming but weak characters and story.Rather than giving a comprehensive review and nitpicking about the lack of available resolutions, or how there are typos and broken tags in the game text, or how the character art was seemingly drawn by little Billy, age 6, using the GIMP's default brush and burn tool, I will focus on my biggest gripes with the game.The UI could benefit from mouseover popups that tell you in detail what everything does. None of the attributes have any kind of description, you have to open the manual for that. You can't easily hover over (de)buff icons to see their effects, you have to either check the manual again or open the caster's status menu and scroll through the skill list for the description. But how long does the buff last? The game won't tell you.Whenever a unit dies, it leaves behind a body that occupies the tile. The reason being that there is a resurrection spell in the game, even though you won't actually see it until the last few stages of the game. Since many of the levels contain small cliffs and narrow passageways, it makes moving your troops forward a pain, and in some cases impossible due to their slow movement and jump values. This makes the already weak melee units even weaker.Difficulty is good for the most part - until the very last level. The final boss fight requires either very high levels, or very specific tactics to counter magic nukes.The AI is poor. Often it only ever attacks the unit closest to it, even if there are vulnerable targets available. Occasionally the AI backs away to cast buffs even if it makes little sense given the situation. AOE casters pay no heed to their allies and will mercilessly harm their allies and possibly even themselves if it means scratching the player's full HP tank a tiny bit. The AI seems to ignore the player's reaction skills entirely, a very useful weakness to exploit during the final battle where a single AOE nuke can wipe out the entire party.Your units' starting positions depend on what party slot they occupy. This is usually not a big deal, but there are some maps where your party is split and placed on the different sides of the map. This can lead to a quick defeat if your fighters and supporters are not evenly distributed.Most importantly, the game is tedious. The story isn't very interesting, you only get bits of the story during the first and last levels of the current floor. Dead bodies quickly clutter up the battlefield and limit possible moves, forcing you to clean up the remaining enemies by moving your ranged units up while everyone else attacks thin air or buffs a rock just to level up their skill proficiencies, and this takes forever. I would highly recommend setting battle speed to its max value from the options menu."

It's not that great, but it's not that bad either.It has a good variety of skills and classes, which makes up for the lack of items and equips, giving room for many different grouping strategies.There are some challenging maps, that will require some ""grinding/training"", making it barely impossible to clear it in one go.There are some issues (such as a childish plot and simple graphics), but the greatest let down is the AI, which is very simple/weak (even in hard mode).The enemy's motto is basically: ""just marches towards your closest foe and hit it with whatever you got"".And that's bad, especially with mages. Don't be surprised to see enemy mages trying to have physical duels against your strongest warriors. Also, when using area skills, they won't care about friendly fire.Overall, this is a simple yet playable game. It's nowhere near FF Tactics or Disgaea and the price may seem a little more than it's worth. Buy at your own risk, and maybe you'll like it as much as I did."

I was hoping on first look that it would be a lighter, but still interesting, PC replacement for one of my all time favourite games Disgaea, or at least on par with something like Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. However the combat system is as basic as I've ever come across in this genre, with very little strategy involved, and poor AI. Perhaps the latter will develop later in the game, but nothing I've seen leads me to believe this will be the case. The storyline also seems very lacking, which wouldn't be so bad if there was anything to the rest of the game.Character and party customization is limited to a fusion system which again is very shallow. The art style is decent, nothing special, and the partial controller support is pretty poor, refuses to map the majority of my controls (on an Xbox 360 pad, so not a case of obscure tech), and is just a headache to use, having to switch between controller and keyboard/mouse in the middle of each characters combat action... really, just don't bother with it using a controller.There is a serious lack of this style of game on the PC, which has always disappointed me, and this game does absolutely nothing for me as a fan of this genre. In the same price range you can get Agarest, which is a far superior offering to scratch that tactical RPG itch. Even those looking for something really basic are going to be far better served by something such as the free flash game Ultimate Tactics."

However it was not, and it does not hold up in the current atmosphere of SRPGs available on Steam or anywhere else.It draws a lot of comparisons to FFT, but for all the wrong reasons.  It's a basic SRPG that needs very little instruction (which is good because it offers absolutely zero) and has a wide array of classes to choose with promotional trees.  This was interesting, but within the first few hours you will find yourself already dismissing entire classes due to their uselessness, and favoring mages instead.  The skill leveling system was also interesting, as individual skills level up with usage, but that goes for defensive and reactive abilities too, which are obviously not easily controlled by you.  This leads to some major grinding needed.To level up the way you'll probably want to, you need to revisit previous stages.  The stages are the exact same layout as your original fight, and you have no way of choosing your own troop deployment or where they start.  It makes the high level of grinding needed in this game even more unenthused.  Read some of the posts and guides on the forum here, some of the suggested leveling methods involves beating the 3 enemies on the very first stage over and over again...  That's just not fun.The story is kinda meh.  I didn't get far and nothing about the story made me want to see what the next stage had going on.If you like PS1 era SRPGs I would suggest Brigandine, Tactics Ogre, Vanguard Bandits etc as far superior options.  If you are limited to products available on Steam, I highly suggest Eador (see my review) or Banner Saga."
,Not Recommended,312600,30384154,Posted: 7 March,all,Dangerous Beans,"This is frustratingly close to being a good game, but it's riddled with obvious issues that prevent it from being one:* I don't usually complain about graphics, and I do like the aesthetic of RB, but lighting is not something should not be omitted in any 3D game.* Control pad support is about as bad as it could be.* Mouse controls (which are obviously favored by the designer) are pretty bad as well.* Balancing simply didn't happen.On the whole it seems like someone was well on their way to making a great game and then they got stopped. Selling this game at the $15 mark is a bit galling. In its present state I'd value it at $5 or less. If it were to be completed then I could see $10, and if it were fully polished $15, but it's simply not there right now.Honestly though, it's close enough that I'd really like to get my hands on the source, close the gap, and just send it back to the dev free of charge. (Assuming it's not written in some obscure gibberish engine's propritetary scripting language. Looking at the file structure, though, that appears unlikely.)"

If you're a huge fan of melee characters, you might not like this game as much simply because it's much more challenging to use them than ranged characters (or if you like challenges then ignore that point). Mages definitely shine here, as they do the most damage and allow you to burst rather quickly.I feel like the game is a bit underdeveloped, where the developers were in a rush so they just released it without more thought. It is a gem however in which that you don't really have to grind too much for an RPG, but it's just the right amount for you to be ok with as a casual gamer. Many unique features like fusion are set up. Don't expect gear, or items or such from a simple fresh turn-based tactical game like this.In short, this game is definitely worth the buy to try (not full price), it offers a fun, tactical positioning, game where each unit matters (since you only use 5 per stage). For a PC game where it can't process many units at once, this game pulls off its simplicity very well. The music is NICE."

,Recommended,312600,14404511,"Posted: 9 February, 2015",all,スターブレイカー,"one of the better SRPGs released in a long time. Hard difficulty is quite hard. There is no Disgaea nonsense here. There is no ffta or ffta2 nonsense. This is a pure SRPG not a Korean grinder pretending to be a SRPG. If you're bad power leveling isn't going to help you much. At least not on hard.Plays like FFT mixed with either older front mission or tactics ogre. Compared to FFT you have far fewer skills per unit but they all do significantly more (e.g. damage + status or defense + status removal). You can pick up to 6 things from a list of actives, passives and overwatch/reaction skills.You have limited ""casts"" of actives per battle, but outside of high tier star spells its hard to run out. There are no items. Passives are basically your items. If your strategy is good you'll progress, if not you wont. Simple as that. If you can't figure it out and refuse to think of some good strategies don't play SRPGs."

If you like Final Fantasy Tactics or the Fire Emblem series you'll feel right at home with this game. A few very specific things about this game are a bit problematic for veterans of the tactics type of games however. (Keep in mind some of these issues are only on HARD, and if you pick the normal difficulty you'll be fine against a few of these issues.)You don't get you place down any of your units at the start, everything is just kind of preset based on where you have your various girls put into slots, so slot 1 always spawns in the same spot on level 1-1, etc.Theres no items. This isn't a huge problem however except for very early on in your gameplay, just because you start with only 3/5 character slots filled, level 1-1 is you vs 3. at the end of 1-1 you get a new girl in your party, which gives you 4 girls... level 1-2 is your 4 girls vs 8 (or 9 I don't remember), so unless you get really lucky with RNG or you will need to rerun 1-1 just to get your 5th girl slot filled.Theres no gear of any sort. The way you get powerful is based on leveling skills, which is also how you evolve your units into different classes. (I like this system but it can be confusing at first)These issues are only really a problem in the very beginnings of the game, and they become non-issues after about 1-3, but I wanted to touch on them so you know what you're getting into and to tell you to NOT QUIT just because it is hard in the beginning, it gets better.One small gripe I wanted to talk about with the game is that the controller support is a bit meh. The pre-game launcher could only detect like, half of the buttons on my wired xbox controller, like I couldn't get it to find my D-pad so I have to use my stick which can be a bit annoying. The other EXTREMELY annoying thing is that for some reason after I have input an action into the game, if I don't want to follow through with that action, pressing the cancel button on my controler doesn't actually cancel the input. I have to right click with my mouse in order to get it to cancel, but every other time I can cancel inputs just fine with my B button on the controller, not sure what that's about.Overall this game gets a 9/10 from me, just because of the simple controller issues, Gameplay itself is an easy 10/10 for this game genre."

(i have only played to the 2nd floor so far and they had both 5 missions each so the other floors should have the same number)there are no items, which make fusing the only way to strengthen your chars, but even that is very limited in number of uses and the attributs affected.there are only two ways of customisation for your chars: classes and skills.if you dont want to rush through the game on easy, you have to play the same missions many times in order to level up, class up, or skill up the chars, because the difficulty of the new missions increases fast.the camera angle is not free rotatable in the horizontale, and a full top-view is not possible; this makes manually selecting chars a bit difficult as they are unselectable from certain angles, if they stand behind big height differences like canyons.rime berta is a nice game, although it feels a bit incomplete, it is still very enjoyable.i think 15€ is a bit too much for this game, but if its on sale, it is worth buying."

You just fight ""stages"" until you end the game. No optional quests. Just passing stages as an old plataformer game. As any other good SRPG, you can grind to find out different jobs and skills. Sadly, it has to be replaying stages, since as I said, it doesn't have optional things. Just stages.Some people mistake this game comparing it with FFT (since it have jobs and stuff like that). I can tell that if you expect this game to be as good as FFT, you are wrong. It is a good game, indeed, but FFT is a masterpiece.The art is nice, but as many other Japan games, it had a lot of girls, and in this case, a lot of lolis.

There of plenty of ""War themed"" SRPGs in the market, so I kindda like this ""change"".The story is simple. It looks more a tale for kids than a story for adults.

In fact, you have to grind unless you know what you're doing right from the start in terms of builds. By grind, I mean spending a couple of hours spamming skills on empty ground/allies.* The reason for the grind is because: individual skills level up based on you using them. New skills / job advancements has skill level requirements.* Class balance is a bit of an issue, but up to you how difficult you want this to be for yourself.

There have a lot of dolls that protect it, some try to help her and some try to stop.You control the dolls as your units in a strategy game, as you level them you can change their classes, every unit have tons of branches of classes that you can try, all of them moe cute girls.The only hard part is that the battles is a little repetitive and you have to grind a little, but its fun because you can get new units and more cute doll girls to your party. :3I'm really sad that people try to compare it to great games and franchises instead of enjoying how simple and fun this is, so dont be afraid of the ""mixed"" overall reviews and give it a chance, you wont regret it."

,Not Recommended,312600,13516216,"Posted: 21 December, 2014",all,Hindenburg 5/6/1937,"Mix of fire emblem and final fantasy tactics battle mechanics with some poorly implemented ideas.  The Ap system in this game is in my opinon a dumb mechanic because it hampers what your characters can do within a turn.  You want to heal your ally, well you're not able to move this turn because of it.  Why do that?!  Also there are very little tooltips and no tutorial so without an outside source you'll be lost what some of the stats mean and various other things within the game.  Also, the story isn't the best.  Fire Eblem and Final Fantasy are known for having at least somewhat interesting stories but this one is bland and you can go multiple levels without even progressing the story through the dialouge. Overall I wouldn't recommend this game for very many people unless you are a dire hard tile-based turn-based jrpg fan."

,Recommended,312600,20692226,"Posted: 22 January, 2016",all,*Logan*,"Rime Berta is an excellent turn-based strategy RPG, with a fun and strategic combat system.It has a horrible title though. I'm sure you'll agree.As you can tell from the screenshots, the game is not very visually impressive and could probabaly run on the original Playstation. I would say most any computer can run it flawlessly, which is certainly a plus.This game is 95% battles, so be aware what you are getting into. There is very limited story and gameplay outside of battles.While it plays similar to other titles such as Disgaea, Final Fantasy Tactics, and Tactics Ogre, it's not as deep or complicated.Choosing to attacking your opponents from higher alltitudes and from behind or from the side is the best choice generally, and your characters have a variety of skills they can use at the end of their turn which adds some fun customization options.Your characters do not equip anything, there are no stores or towns, and there are no inventory items.There are many classes you start with, and if you level up the right skills and abilities for your characters, they will be able to change classes into something more powerful.The artwork is pretty bad in my opinion, and the world is filled with women. There are no male characters at all in this game. That's a first for me, I've never seen that in a game.I found the music in battles to get annoying quickly, and the world map music, while unique to the floor you are on, is almost always forgettable and mediocre.The sound effects however are very good, and some of the spell effects are very nice.It took me over 40 hours to beat this game, but there is plenty of levelling I could still do, and the game lets you continue again after the final boss fight so you can keep grinding and earning achievements if you want.This adds a lot of replay and that's certainly a plus.I highly recommend this game if you like this sort of gameplay. In that regards you will not be dissapointed, but don't buy this for any other reason than gameplay, or you will be dissapointed.At the end of the day, that's all that matters."

76561198014072231,Recommended,312600,20368142,"Posted: 6 January, 2016",all,IronMana,"I wish the recommendation had a ""Yes, with a caveat"" option because that's about what I feel.For one, I don't think this game is bad. I especially don't mind it since it was just a $5 flyer to see what it was about. I've spent $5 on bad pastries, and a kinda decent game lasts longer and won't give me a stomach ache.In any case, one thing I have to agree with that I've seen in other reviews is the bad AI. I've seen it miss some obvious chances to kill my characters and fail to do simple things like change facing so that it's not exposing it's characters' backs. Healers and other units using self buffs seem to be the biggest offenders. Healer will step back, heal self or ally and then stay back turned to my girls. Not good.The story has potential but it's never explored - at least so far. Too bad because it seems like it has the makings of something interesting - even with the ""one place"" setting. Azure Dreams did it fine.The music might be one of the best things about the game. Very well done.I also like that it's not terribly complex, rules-wise but has some nuance around the AP system and the skill level system leading to class changing that's similar to the job level requirements in FFT, though not as freeform in terms of moving around the jobs (it's tree based unlike FFT, which is more freeform with what you pick and trees were mostly for requirements, not what characters can choose from).So, overall, I will put a recommend on the game, because it's not terrible, but with the following cavaets:-Try to pick it up on sale/less than the full price.-Expect a simpler/more easygoing type tactical RPG. There's some nuance, but nothing complex or new.-Don't expect a major challenge unless you create one for yourself, if that's possible.-If you're willing just to spend some time with a more fun-like tactical RPG, this game will suit that purpose.-Enjoy the music. It's good. Heck, cheap enough and you'll have a low-priced game soundtrack out of it if you can record it and burn it to a CD or something.If there's ever a Rime Berta 2 or the developer wants to make another tactical RPG...please work on your AI systems. It's easily the biggest failing of the game, imo. At the very least, make a more ruthless AI for the Hard level if you want Easy/Normal to be more fun/easygoing."
,Recommended,312600,20539628,"Posted: 15 January, 2016",all,Silver,Rime Berta is a simple Tactical Rpg game. Its gameplay is similar to Final Fantasy Tactics and Disgaea (and a few others). It might not have an equipment system but what it does have is multiple classes each with a few abilities (which you can alway equip regardless of their current class). There is however a limited number of slots so expect swapping abilities often. The art and graphics might not be cutting edge but it sure is ADORABLEIts not very difficult if you grind a bit (each level is repeatable) I would say grinding for some of the later classes might be a bit tedious though. Play this if you like tactical games and or you want to play a simple and adorable game
