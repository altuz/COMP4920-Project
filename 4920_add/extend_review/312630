,Recommended,312630,11583988,"Posted: 6 August, 2014",all,shoggofu,"I've played for 2 hours and made it to mission 11 of 20. I didn't realize it was a PC port of an android title until after I started playing, so at first I wasn't sure that it was a good choice. It turns out however that;- It's pretty fun and has some cool and sometimes pretty amusing features- After playing the standard edition, deluxe and OTT versions don't sound worth it at allhttp://youtu.be/mQPyJQA-BpQhttp://youtu.be/k14gphrlbXYAt first maps looked like they were way too small and felt cramped. Tower placement is restricted to spots around the map marked with an X. Also you can't increase the speed of the game. None of these were really an issue in the end later maps were big enough and you just need to make sure you have a good combination of different types of towers in limited locations where you are able to place them. You also have a pool of up to seven heroes, three of which you can take onto the battlefield each stage. I unlocked five of them by stage ten. They can be ordered around the map to attack enemies and also have special abilities which can be upgraded as your heroes level up after completing stages. My favorite heroes were the recon and rocketeer. The rocketeer can periodically call in a powerful cruise missile strike anywhere on the map. The recon was able to mark targets so that the rocketeer and any missile turrets could fire missiles at them even if they were out of range. That was my favorite thing about this game. Not every tower defense game has stuff like that. Also you can buy weapon and armor upgrades for your heroes. This is how you spend your coins and medals. I just bought the standard version of this game so I earned all my currency just by completing stages. Some of the stuff is pretty expensive especially the armor, so I could only afford basic weapon upgrades. This didn't really seem to matter, I still kicked♥♥♥♥♥without better gear. I don't see why you would want to get the deluxe or OTT editions of this game just for extra coins and medals. 100,000 coins will only get you two sets of basic armor... You also use medals to resurrect fallen heroes between stages, but so far my guys hardly ever died. I don't seem have a shortage of medals. Again another reason why I don't see the point in paying more real money for coins and medals. Why would you pay for extra currency in a non free to play single player game?Some of the enemy models were really amusing. There are giant disfigured teddy bears that shoot laser beams out there eyes and obese green skinned cleaver wielding zombies that ride mobility scooters lol amd puke gibs all over your turrets and heroes. Also I really liked some of the dialogue, one the heroes sends up Batman 'my throat hurts... do you have a throat lozenge?' lolMaybe there are actually people out there who want the extra art and stuff. But the Deluxe and OTT editions are over double and triple the price respectively of the standard edition. This problem is easily solved by just getting the standard edition lol, which I recommend trying."

I wanted to close the game and gave this game a negative review. I forced myself to play a little bit and i changed my opinion from the total negative to neutral. There is no neutral rating, so i chose positive.Pros- There are heroes. You can take up to 3 to battle. There are total 9 heroes. So you have to choose- RPG system for heroes. Level up your heroes and learn skills. There are 16 skills for every hero. The most of them are passive, but you can unlock new active abilities. Yeah, every hero can take 2 abilities to the battle. So, you will have 6 active skills in the battle. It's quite interesting.- Beside skills, every hero has inventory with 4 slots. You can buy better weapon, armor, etc.- Cool effects for deathhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=925601480Cons- The game is really really slow and there are no game speed settings. The first levels were boring and with no possibility to increase the speed it got me angry. The further stages are harder and more interesting, so it got no so critical.- There are no difficulty settings. I think, the game will be hard for the most of the users.- The explanation of things is bad. There no tooltips for icons, skills and even for towers. Nonsense. I couldn't understand almost everything during the missions. Yeah, there is an encyclopedia in the game, but I am sure everybody like to learn things directly in the battle.- The strategic potential of the game is really low. I agree, there are 3 types of damage/armor and you must use proper towers for every level. But, it's really unclear which armor type has an exact monster. Towers don't have any abilities (I am sure for passing first 7 stages).- The past of mobile. There are counters for the ressurections of heroes (40m). WTF? There are lot of grind in the game, because you need better weapon and higher level team.- The graphics is angular. I am not a big fan of that.- Music is forgettable. Sound design is average.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=925601439So, it's more arcade game than strategy. It has a lot of minuses. I would prefer to play this game on mobile, because there are a lot much more better TD titles in Steam. I even couldn't finish the game, because the gameplay is slow for me. But the game is polished, no bugs were found. It has some fresh ideas, so i can't give this game a negative. Actually, my review is closer to neutral, but there is no such option.If you are OK with it, you could this game a try.I can recommend OTTTD to buying on a sale with 75%+ discount"
,Recommended,312630,13624069,"Posted: 26 December, 2014",all,TesseracT,"Tower Defense is one of my favorite genres, and this is one of the best TD games on steam.To start It has tight controls, and a smart hotkey layout. I found this to be the main problem with most of the tower defense games I have tried so far.The only issue I have with the game is that tower placement is restricted to pre determined areas, this lowers the difficulty of the game and the strategic aspect. However as you progress further It becomes less of an issue as the maps become bigger.I would rate the game 8/10"
,Recommended,312630,11610659,"Posted: 8 August, 2014",all,Durrdiss,"Fun, thoroughly enjoyable game, but doesn't feel quite right on PC.OTTTD is mainly a tower defence/rts/rpg hybrid. You build your towers in fixed spots, level up and unlock abilities for your characters, then mess up a bunch of enemies.First the positive. It is a very quirky, characterful game. I've smirked on a number of occasions when the next bad guy starts walking down the paths. If undead teddy bears, giant flying shark fortresses, and 'shanktopuses' are your thing, then get this game!Music and sound effects are good, as is the voice acting. Didn't turn me off or make me cringe, which as a sound designer myself, is a really good thing.The whole atmosphere is great, and whoever wrote all the little jokes on the items/upgrades/achievements needs a pat on the back.And of course, gameplay is smooth, easy to get the hang of, and quite intense in the later stages.So, it all sounds really good, right? Well it's important to know that this is technically a port of a mobile game. I was aware when I bought this, and it certainly shows, but it's not necessarily a bad thing...in places.For example, it is easy enough to get coins and medals (the respective currencies) in game, and the option for microtransactions is absent (or at least, I couldn't see it). This is obviously a big thumbs up, although it makes the fancypants versions for sale kind of obsolete unless you're into the extras.However, when a character dies, you have a time limit before you can use them again. You can speed this up at the cost of a medal. To be honest, I wasn't that bothered by it initially, as earning medals is easy, but that changed once I unlocked the first endless level. If your characters die, they gain 0 experience AND you have to wait for them to revive. Getting no exp from a 15+ wave run is one thing, but then having to wait 45 minutes (without using a medal) to revive is another. Not cool.NOTE: After playing it a little longer, this no longer becomes an issue, as you'll have a huge surplus of medals.Another example would be that, in order to pan across the stage, you actually have to click and drag, like using your finger on a tablet. Not a bad thing, but I'm more used to the rts-esque camera-follows-the-mouse deal.There's also little in the way of settings customisation, although if you bought this game with that in mind, then I don't know what you expected.A lot of these small things constantly remind me that it's a mobile port. Too many control/mechanic decisions feel a little foreign to the keyboard and mouse. It's unfortunate that these small issues glares over an otherwise fantastic game, because I've thoroughly enjoyed every moment of the actual gameplay.If you can accept that, then you should definitely check this out. Definitely worth the current price (the standard edition anyway)."

It's my favorite game genre. I just played through the whole campaign of OTTTD, and it was the most fun I've had playing tower defense in a long time! I've already started replaying maps just for the fun of it. There's also Endless mode.OTTTD is an excellent mix of TD, RTS group tactical play, with the leveling elements of RPG. You have all of the classic tower types, plus you have several characters, and you can bring three of them onto the battlefield and control their movements and their special attacks. Each character is unique. The whole game is unique, with a style all its own, while still feeling like a classic tower defense game with lots of extras.Everything is extremely well-balanced. The maps are challenging, yet certainly doable if you make wise choices with your characters and towers. Each character brings something different, and some of their abilities play off of each other and the towers. There is a lot of variety in the maps. Some characters are more useful on some maps than others, and some work better in certain group combinations than others.There's a lot of high quality game here for the money, especially with Endless mode."

Weapons/armour can be purchased with ingame currency and the characters have a very nice leveling system.Recommend this to all TD fans, this is a good one.Personally I purchased just the 'entry level' edition.

Had me laughing with some of the things that were said as well as written.The game mechanics was fairly good as was the game play up to the 4th level, where it seemed to go from fairly easy to wow I got my butt kicked, again and again and again. So nothing for it but to replay level 3 for like ever, while upgrading my only 2 unlocked characters. Considering I played the first 3 levels with 3 stars in like 15-20 mins and spending 2 hours replaying to upgrade and still can't beat level 4, what the hey. Game grinding again, ugh.The artwork is a bit mediocre but still fairly good. All in all, I enjoyed my experience and want to get back into my grind to see what lies ahead."

The character voice acting is spot-on and the gore elements really make the aesthetics pop.My only criticism would be that there is not much variety between levels and the player involvement starts to feel a bit token after an extended session gaming, all you really do is repair and update the towers.Well worth the money though."

The best way for me to explain this game is that it feels like a F2P game that had in app purchases to ""quick buy"" skill points and the better items, except, even if you wanted to do that, that option is not there and time is the only investment.Again, a mostly fun experience that got really frustrating. After 19 hours I've had some fun with this game, but it's time to move on. A ""no"" rating from me, unless you're looking for a squad/skill upgrade tower defense game AND you've already played the excellent Defender's Quest."

,Recommended,312630,29544914,Posted: 28 January,all,Phantom Lord,"Very neat TD game. It is unique in its own way.  Apart from the towers, you pick three heroes to accompany you in each battle. And each of your heroes has unique abilities to use against enemies or to help allies.  The heroes are leveled up after each mission, and if killed can be revived in the main menu. There are seven heroes to pick from, for a variety of reasons. The game has Boss levels, and you can repeat any level you like to increase XP for your heroes, or to harvest money to purchase guns and armor for them. The downside is that towards the end, it gets a lot repetitive, since your heroes need to be at a quite a HIGH level to get to endgame.I also didn't like the tower-upgrading option, since I have to remember which tower does what. There are many upgrades options, but there is no ""balloon"" showing the attributes I'll get with that upgrade. Not that big of a deal, but could make my playing time easier.I find the graphics very pleasant for a game released almost 3 years ago. At 8euros its very nice priced.

You have different heroes that all can be levelled up and equipped. Usually that means beating levels multiple times to gain ""medals"" and ""credits"". You need both to buy better weapons and armor. You've levelled the ""wrong"" hero? Well, bad luck, better spend the next 5 hours grinding more money and hero levels (to get skill points), so you have a hero that makes the level manageable.I'm currently at level 22. You can only place ONE Tower...so if you don't have insanely strong heroes, you will fail and fail and fail. That is NOT fun game play. Not to mention that the game really wears out after about half the levels imho. After that the enemies get bland and just gain more defences against certain damage types.I could appreciate the hero and equipment aspect as something tactical, but the infuriating levelling and currency systems from the mobile version just make we want to uninstall the game, which I will finally do now, otherwise I will spend another 10 hours or more of my life for something that's just not worth it imho, because the novelty is gone and every level that needs to be repeated again and again is just a drag...good bye OTTTD.

A blend of towers and hero units gives that extra bit of interaction over others of this genre.  The game unfortunately suffers from a few balance issues and has poor conveyance with some skill descriptions. The lack of micro management also creates an artificial difficulty. If you notice, as an example, that physical resistant units are reaching your base constantly and build a tower of fire or shock you may still end up having those enemies reach your base. The new tower could target any foe in range. The player has no control over tower targets and towers will continue to shoot until that target is dead or moves out of range. There is a similar issue with the heros but being able to move them means you have some control on who they shoot. Although the game has issues it is still a decent tower defense game.I wish there was an in between answer.

It is not even close to the solid titles like Defense Grid I or the old WC3 maps but it is funny and compact. Of course no one can release a TD these days without adding something new. In this case we have ""heroes"". Luckily (for me) you can just stick 'em at a chokepoint and let them act as a tower. Until level 20 (there are only 25 levels btw) the game does not force these heroes into a critical role which is nice (it is a TD afterall). ♥♥♥♥♥♥is bound to hit the fan of course, which happens around lvl 21 I think (though it might be earlier for the 3 stars). You'll need heroes equipped with the right equipment at fairly high levels. And this ladies and gentleman requires a genuine grind, especially when you like the wrong heroes.  The equipment is fairly easy as there are only a few tiers, but grinding the heroes will take you as long as the the actual game from level 1-20ish. I did try, so the game must be on par with waffles for a short time. And that it is. Worth picking up the main game for a discount (it's to short a limited for 10eu for my taste and the deluxe is just silly).It does have potential though. Maybe in the future we'll get a DLC with more levels, heroes, tiers ... well everything really.Elmo the grumpy lootmaster signing off"

The waves come fast and furious and the music is great, the little quips during the game are quite funny.The game uses a random generator for the hero names and some are just great.  There is humor throughout the game.  It is just a fun game to play and well worth the $10 I paid.Works great on Linux Mint 17 64 bit.  I had no fuss, no muss download and play."
