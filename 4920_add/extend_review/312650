,Recommended,312650,31725566,Posted: 13 May,all,Tabellen Peter,"Not bad at all, but you need to be pretty immune to motion sickness. If you are (or until the developer implements some kind of comfort options) it's quite fun!It can be played either solo or via online campaign, co-op only. The solo part is there, but do not expect the same experience as with others, this game was clearly made to be played in co-op, as some mission types are quite unmanagable solo and skills are worthless if not used against other players (like healing).Campaigns are played on a hex based map. Maps can be small, medium or large, with four different difficulties. During the campaign you earn points, can invest them in attributes (armor, heal, collecting and so on) or use them for weapon/special skill upgrades on specific points on the campaign map. The campaigns are stored on the host, so you can continue later with your friends.That said, it's quite hard and taxing sometimes. If all people die, you loose all progress and the only thing that can prevent it are lives you need to buy from your hard earned cash. Those are shared between players so it can be quite rage-inducing when playing with beginners who are neither too young to understand teamwork or people just beginning with their battlezone career and avoiding voice chats alltogether.There is only one final boss fight, none in between, and it feels like a simpler raid boss. There are special enemies that act like mini bosses (bullet sponges) but they are mixed with the mission type you are playing anyway and there is only one variant of it.Learning all the mechanics is quite hard as the given tutorials are far away from teaching you the campaign UI, basic radar stuff, available skills and so on. You need to learn it by playing with others (at best) and that leads to having not a single clue for the first 3-5 missions.You can unlock skills, weapons (through sub-objectives and other ways) and tanks (by completing the campaign) that stay with you. Skills and weapons can then be bought later on in the campaign, but they require campaign money. Tanks are picked at the joining/starting of the campaign. Some are more specialies, some have better starting-loadouts. It's quite unintuitive though and you need some time to get an idea whats happening there.All that said, it's a ride! It's hard, with people that are not too shy it's also a lot of fun. You get to work together, specialise, try the harder difficulties and so on.It will also test the limits of players. A campaign is easily a 1+ hour task and you can and will notice how other persons get tired because of the continous VR stress and nothing feels more depressing to end a campaign early because of required real life breaks or your body that cant handle the nousea anymore three missions before the end of the campaign."

Best played with a couple friends, it's very hard to find any available public games. The fast movement in VR can make some people sick,  but they added comfort settings for people that are bothered by fast movement in VR. This game is really fun and if you like coop games in VR then it's a must have."
,Recommended,312650,32832009,Posted: 26 June,all,Magdaki,"An absolutely terrific game. I was expecting a simple little shooter, but this game is so much more. The core game is a war map, where each hex represents a mission. You have to fight your way to the enemy base (say about 15-20 missions) and destroy it. The game is very hard. Enemy forces scale up quickly and if unchecked will spawn a nemesis tank that is very tough. The AI units operate fairly effectively. They will try to flank you and will actively try to dodge your shots; however, they are not so skilled that the game becomes unfun. There is a  co-op multiplayer that I've not tried which would likely improve the game further. All in all, this is easy to recommend.I do have two complaints:1 - To reduce enemy power you have to find a power relay station. These appear at random in missions, which means that your success in a particular war can be very RNG influenced.2 - The in-app purchases are BS. Sorry devs, I calls it as a I sees it. There's no reason for bobbleheads and camos to be a purchase instead of an unlockable at the price of the core game."

Ok maybe House of the Dying Sun too, but while both that and Battlezone are roguelikes, Battlezone definitely has deeper and more satisfying gameplay.This is an extremely solid VR title, and among the best you can get right now.Remember: Lives are shared.

That being said, I'd like to leave some tips for those just starting out, as there is little to no tutorial/explanation.1. Although it is primarily an action experience, strategizing and patience are keys to success in your campaign. You will quickly learn that running and gunning will not get you far in this game.2. Expanding on point #1, start out on beginner or easy with the heavy tank. The weapons are more powerful and the tank can take much more abuse than the medium. Use turbo VERY sparingly, as it quickly drains your shields.3. Speaking of shields, learn to keep an eye on them during combat (circle split into 4 segments surrounding your radar). If your front shield goes into red, pivot your tank so another segment is taking damage.4. Between hexes (levels), make sure you are upgrading your shields by hitting RB - this brings up the upgrade screen where you can spend your data (credits) on upgrade modules.So many other aspects to this game, but those are the main points I wish I knew from the beginning.This is really a fantastic game. It may take a few hours to get into, but with a little perseverence this experience becomes quite rewarding. 10/10"
76561198027283658,Recommended,312650,31837996,Posted: 19 May,all,Freschu,"Battlezone is a solid, fun game. It looks great, runs smooth, doesn't have significant bugs. It's seated VR, you control your tank with gamepad. Gamepad controls work great and feel responsive and accurate enough.The unlock progression doesn't feel like a grind. The unlockable tanks offer mostly specialization, so they're not required. Weapon unlocks aren't random, they unlock based on secondary mission objectives or achievements listed in the arsenal. Weapons require varying amounts of skill to use, but not overly much so. None of the weapons feel useless, while each having a specific use case where they're the most effective. Likewise for the special abilities, it only takes a short while to learn knowing how it works and when to use it, but then they're all useful.Multiplayer experience depends on teamplay, especially the harder difficulties. Obviously, with the right team it's great fun, while playing with uncooperative players quickly leads to campaign failure. That said, each of the tanks, weapons and abilities is useful and helps finish a campaign. There isn't a wrong tank to pick, but variety helps later in the campaign.While multiplayer is great, I can't recommend single-player too much. If you take your time, most of the missions are completable. However, there are just a few mission types - where you have do defend one base and attack another - that are very frustrating on harder difficulty.There's both a strategic element and a tactical element to Battlezone. On the campaign map you'll have to plan your route through missions to supply points for upgrades, while keeping the overall enemy level in mind. During missions there's a tactical element in how well you and your team sticks together, how well you use the environment, and how you engange the different enemy types and waves.Replay value is great, as each campaign is randomly generated as well as the mission environments. While there are some recognizable elements in the mission environment, it's not to obvious. While there are only a few mission types and some ultimately boil down to ""destroy everything"", it doesn't make them any less fun. Blowing stuff up never gets old.In my opinion, Battlezone is a solid, fun game and is worth buying. I recommend playing with friends for maximum enjoyment. In my opinion Battlezone would make a good game even without VR. However seated VR works well for Battlezone and certainly adds to the experience."

I never thought that a seated VR title would impress me as much as this game has, but this game is so polished.It's amazing what happens when a AAA company makes a VR game.  The only thing that I am not a fan of is that lack of explanation for a lot of the in game elements; with that being said, the devs are all over the steam forums answering questions and helping the community with anything they need.If you can afford a VR, you can afford this game.

,Recommended,312650,33028988,Posted: 30 June,all,Hockenmaier,"I was very close to passing on this game since it's a controller based VR game which I always thought was yucky.  But today I learned that controller VR is not necessarily yucky (even if it usually is).  To be quite honest, this game needs the joystick that the Vive wands don't offer.And regarding the actual game play, this is just great.  It is not the least sickening game I have played, but once you get used to the artificial rotation it feels really good.  The unlocks are powerful and the progression is nicely paced.  And more than anything, this is a fully fleshed out and well thought out co-op campaign, which there are Very few of in the world of VR so far.This game made me go by everyplace since I am no longer doubtful that controller based VR games can be great."
76561197993703914,Recommended,312650,31832258,Posted: 18 May,all,Primate,"I love this game. There are very few polished, complete games for VR but this is one of them. The combat is fun, fast paced and rewards skill. Missions feel varied in their objectives and the fact that much of the game is randomly generated gives it a lot of replayability. In multiplayer, teamwork is crucial. The FTL-style plot your course through the game to the finale is great, though I wish there were some different possible outcomes to some of the text-based events.Crucially the handling and control of all the tanks is excellent, and most of the weapons feel great to use. I do wish though that aiming was not locked to the front of the tank; it is likely a byproduct of needing to be compatible with PSVR and other front facing setups. Also the control method is perfect - I've seen a few people criticise the game for not using motion controls but frankly motion controls just wouldn't work for this style of game and wouldn't provide the necessary responsiveness for its pace.For those worried about VR comfort issues, this is a very comfortable game to play. Despite the fast pace, the game does a lot of things to keep you comfortable, like having terrain comprised completely of flat planes and keeping the horizon steady.I have two minor issues, the first being that keybindings don't seem to currently work. One of the first things I did was rebind D-pad controls to weapon slots rather than to multiplayer commendations, but it didn't seem to work correctly, simply unbinding the default controls. The default controls work well but the option to rebind would be welcome.The other, again minor issue is the music and sound design. The music is just not very memorable or interesting. It's the same bland, thumping techno noise the entire game. There could be a lot more audio cues as well, for when shields go down, hull is taking damage or just vehicle engine sounds and ambient noise. It's really easy to not realise one of your shields is down in the heat of battle unless you're specifically looking down at your interface."

Absolutely love it.I played this on the PS4 VR at eurogamer last year - I queued for 2 hours to play the intro for 5 mins. It was THE game that made me decide to get a VR kit (HTC Vive). I was really excited to see the game has finally come to the PC.Its the only game I have that I'll play for hours at a time, and not notice the time passing.. This is what VR is made for. I especially love the bonus game - a recreation in VR of the original battlezone! I used to play this in the arcade when I was a kid - I'd pay the money just for that alone.I've seen people on here complain that its not room scale. 2 things - Firstly, sometimes its good to play seated. I dont have the energy to prance around the room with a helmet on my head for hours at a time. Sometimes you just want to sit and relax. Secondly - you are in a TANK, so what do you expect? FFS."

The randomised levels are fantastic and some of them are really a spectacle to see even after 15+ hours.  Multiplayer is where the heart of the game lies but don't underestimate how annoying it can be when someone joins your game and wastes all the shared team lives by respawning constantly :D
,Recommended,312650,31736452,Posted: 13 May,all,TheCrimsonBeast,"My new favortite VR game, but it has its flaws. The movement is nausea inducing at first so just be aware of that and know you might have to wait a while to really get into it. The first time I only lasted 15min before i felt a bit  nauseas and so I stopped right away. I recommend doing the same for all VR games that give you nausea btw. Second time I went through the entire campaign, which is about 2 hours on normal difficulty, and felt great enough to go again afterward. I've run into a few bugs such as starting a round with no ammo on a recently purchased weapon and a teamate being unable to move.Now for the good stuff. The grapchis are simple, but good enough to be completely immersed in the world. There are 3 starting tanks each with different speeds, armor and starting weapons. As you complete missions you earn credits which you can use to customize and improve your tank. This ability to customize along with randomly generated missions adds a lot of replayability. Despite its flaws I think this is a must buy game."

,Recommended,312650,31750325,Posted: 14 May,all,EternalGamer,"Battlezone is easily one of my favorite Vr titles and it is also one of the most fleshed out VR games available.  There's nothing ""indie"" or ""early access"" about it.  It is polished, professionally designed, and has a complete campaign with hours and hours of content.Its difficulty forces cooporation and there is a decent variety in the missions and events.  It's less a traditional tank game and more of a 4 player coop rogue like with a retro 90's arcade tank aesthetic.  Your group will have to make narrative choices with consequences at certain points.  You have to carefully pick which areas to progress to on the map and work together to stay alive.Regarding the potential motion sickness, in my experience the game does take a bit of time to adjust to it, but it is nothing severe.  If you feel ""off"" after playing for a bit, just take a break and come back.  My first sessions (on PSVR) I had this issue, and then again after not playing it of ra while when I played it on Vive.  But after a sessions or two, I was able to play long periods of time without any issue.  Just don't push it to hard and you'll adjust fine."

Lock on missile? Artillery? anything.Even if you have friends or not, this is a really great Co-op game, i experienced some quickly developing bromance with strangers, and m8, i am a introvert.Playing the Campaign solo is entertaining, but i actually started playing the campaign with other players instead.Aslong as you don't join a random server filled with people that don't understand English then ey!Even not in a level, i found it pretty cool just to sit in your cockpit in between missions chatting up strategies with them fellow teammates.Oh yeah! a tip for new players playing multiplayer! don't respawn when you get shot to death, let a teammate revive you instead! that's why there's a clock ticking because you're in a ""Bleed out"" mode, you want to save those precious lives, because if everyones dead and there's no more lives? the entire game is over and so is the campaign, so don't go busting them lives!Is the game short? long? difficult? easy?No matter because you can set all those up.The campaign length is up to you to choose aswell.""It's a VR game, so you choose the short one right?""I did that at first, but when i first did a long campaign and finished it? i just went ""Aww man... it's over?...""All the fun is in doing the campaign or doing it with your bros or newly made bros, and not ending it quickly.When it comes to motion sickness, i felt completly fine, probably due to illusion of actually driving a vehicle and not standing up ""walking""Even so, the human ability to adapt can be pretty terrifying.So aye, i didn't flinch, though different VR games affect differently to other people.So it depends on if you're fine with driving Vehicles in VR or not.Mostly due to me being a Co-op, simulation and tank lover, the only downside i think about this game, is that my friends don't own it and neither own a VR headset.I'd almost purchase them all of that."

Only problem experienced was lag with 4 other players on map but that could have been connection related.Perfect value for the money spent as I see myself spending several hours on this one.

I hope they add PVP very soon. Right now it is only SP and MP Co-op. It would make this game an instant classic. The weapon progression is also cool because you can upgrade a lot. Each play-through requires you to upgrade from the begining. This allows for playing with different combinations of play styles. Buy this if you love cockpit VR games!

When I checked the server listing, there weren't any games going, so I started a game of my own, and only played alone for... maybe 5 minutes tops before other people joined my game.For what it's worth, I liked this game enough that I bought it for PC (for improved graphics & HOTAS controller support), even though I already own it on PSVR."
76561198006576322,Recommended,312650,31756656,Posted: 14 May,all,gfseb,"It is a very fun game with a lot of strategic depth when it comes to the overworld map between mission, and simple pick up and play mechanics within missions. The rougelike elements add replaability, and unlocks become avaialbe during subsequent playthroughs (though you still have to find depots to actually equip new weapons). The tutorials kinda suck and most mechanics you have to learn as you go, but there are some good guides out there. Game can be played solo, but was obviously designed for co-op. Some missions are not manageable unless you have other people with you.Biggest issue was motion sickness, but you can sort of train yourself to get over it. I got sick after 20 minutes the first time I played and almost refunded, but I lasted almost 40 minutes the second time around, and a full hour on my third day. I finally got to the point where it doesn't bother me anymore, and I am glad a stuck with it. This has higher replay value than most VR titles out there."

Gameplay seemed very solid and graphics looked great, so I decided to pay 30 euros and give it a shot.And what a solid tank cockpit shooter this is. It looks super super cool and runs great (maxed out on 1080GTX), no hiccups, no crashes. The gameplay is great, the shooting is intense and paying attention matters - it's a fast paced and can be positively challenging - with a few difficulty levels having notable differences. There are lots of unlockables (weapons and upgrades, tank types) and more than decent ride customization. No motion sickness issues over here at all, the player's POV is fixed on the horizon and the cockpit moves around the player's head, so no sudden image shifting that might induce sickness while sitting.My only complaint would be that it can get a tad repetitive in offline mode, however the pvp and campaign co-op modes come along just nicely and fix that. Good player-base so far and no disconnects.Overall, the game is absolutely great - one of the most complete and polished, optimized experiences on the Vive so far. Well done and tank you devs!"

I've been playing for 8.8 hours so far and I still haven't completed a solo ""short"" duration campaign at EASY difficulty. Short duration campaigns seem to last approximately 1 hour if you don't lose before reaching the volcano. If you're playing single player, then that's great.I can't offer a lot of feedback on the multplayer. I got to play a good bit of it for pick up grouping when the game first released. By now, I figure most of the players with similar skills are already playing in groups with one another to complete the game's objectives. The multiplayer is very functional and smooth. There was no weird hitching or lag even when I had the maximum amount of players in a game I'd host.The game play is smooth. At first, I would get dizzy/uncomfortable and need breaks after about 15 minutes of this game.  My play sessions were too short to continue playing multiplayer pick up group style, so I'm now playing a lot more offline than online. I found the VR play comfortable for longer than 15 minute sessions if I didn't wear headphones while playing.Some games I just wont be good at. I think I'm okay with this being one of them.The game definitely rewards twitchy reflexes!"

Using 980Ti on Ultra settings SS 1.5. Great work dev. Seems difficult so far but very polished and fun gameplay.Edit: Now 10+ hours in, beat the final level 3 or 4 times. The game is epic fun and is one of the best experiences I've had in VR so far. The unlock system is fun and there's bonus items to find in many levels.Been running the game at ultra settings and SS at 1.9. Running on a GTX980Ti OC to 1480Mhz. Afterburner shows 80-90% GPU usage at these settings. Very well optimized game. I've had one crash so far but I belive my GPU OC was the culprit so I dropped about 10Mhz.All in all, this game is great squad gameplay. I recommend a mic for the best experience, coordinating with your team in later levels is very important to achieve victory. There are plenty of different upgrade paths and there are even in game choices caused by random events during the campaign.There are a few small negatives. Everyone has a pool of lives and a griefer could easily join a game and die many times and leave, forcing the squad to re-buy extra lives at great expense.Also the game is not cross platform multiplayer, you can only play with people who bought the same version as you. Unfortunately this means the Steam version and Oculus home versions cannot play together.Some people report motion sickness, I've got at least 500 hours in VR by now and I haven't had a single issue with this. I could see how VR newbs would have issues so be careful if your newb, you can work through the motion sickness by focusing on your firing reticle and far away objects. I've heard this helps.It can be played single player but multiplayer is much more fun.Overall, this is a great title, Polished gameplay, fun multiplayer and runs like a gem. 8.5/10"

,Recommended,312650,31936277,Posted: 24 May,all,Crafty,"This game is great fun, and one of the few VR titles that I can honestly say is worth the money.  I've put in about 20 hours of single player action so far, and haven't played multiplayer yet.  I'm sure that's awesome as well, since it seems the game was designed around coop.  The single player missions are hard even when you set the difficulty to easy, so I'm sure the experience is even better.  I just didn't want to jump into multiplayer green and drag down the team.  I think I am ready now. :-).It would be nice is the devs created controls for the motion controllers and not just the gamepad, but given that it is Battlezone, the dual stick on the gamepad works great for manuvering the tank.  I would probably choose to use the gamepad even if the motion controllers were an option.  Since it is a seated experience, then it really doesn't matter much to me.I can see why some people experience motion sickness with this title.  I find you have to acclimate to it. The woosy feeling seemed to subside the better I got at driving the tank.   I think it's good form for the devs to try and make it easier for those that are more suseptable to it, but I wouldn't want them to enforce it accross the board.  It would have to be optional.  I have no problem with the game the way it is now, and I wouldn't want to lose my peripheral vision in exchange for the ""fix"".Other than that, I find that some of the enemy respawns in the game are cheap shots meant to burn your lives.  In a typical conflict you win ground and advance the line.  Not so much here.   You'll clear the same area several times.  I'm starting to predict it, but I don't think it's necessary.  I'd rather have them throw more enemy at me from a distance than have a single heavy tank respawn behind me. If they are gonna suckerpunch you then they should make the lives a  little more affordable.  I have been unable to get to the bigger upgrades simply because I'm spending too much on lives that (in most cases) I shouldn't have lost.  However, that too could be because the game is really designed for multiplayer.The biggest selling point in my opinion is the replayability.  I know I am going to burn hours on this title because of the way they've designed it.  No two campaigns are the same, and it's fun of you just want to spend ten minutes, or if you want to play for hours.  The VR games are still emerging, and it seems we have new choices almost every day, but only a few will stand the test of time.  My money is on this game being one of them."

The inside of your tank is really cool lots of monitors and such. Lots of tanks and loads of weapons to choose from to outfit your machine of doom. There are custom skins for the inside and outside of your tank too.  Game play is a lot of fun with a small learning curve. I really think this game is awesome once you get used to using a controller.  I prefer mouse and keys myself and didn't own any controllers until this game makes you use one. I discovered that it would seam that aftermarket bluetooth controllers are unsupported as mine wouldn't work, but windows saw it perfectly.  Wish they would have vive controller support in the future.As for motion sickness im the kind of guy that gets it from just riding in the back seat of a car, and in the passengers seat on long trips , but never when I drive.
