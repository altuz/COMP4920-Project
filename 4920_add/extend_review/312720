And just when you think youve got it nailed and youve won, a simple turn of a piece ruins everything for you. Im hoping more people purchase this so you can get into online games instantly.There are varying starting layouts for the pieces or you can go random. The rules are pretty simple but as always in a game like this well worth reading them.Theres not a lot more to say really, If you love logic and puzzle games, enjoy having gray hair a little  sooner than you should then buy it! be sure to send me a online match request >:) ( chess players will probably love this game )The only thing i think could have made a drastic improvemment is a chatbox in game rather than having to chat through steam which pauses the game."

When I found it on steam I had to snag a copy! It's a deceptively simple game and great to play with a friend, casual matches are maybe twenty minutes in length.The digital implementation of the actual boardgame is straightforward and decently done. Legal moves are shown when picking up any piece, and the last moved piece for both players receives a gold-tint as a helpful reminder. The game includes the Classic, Dynasty, and Imhotep starting layouts. The AI has five setting levels, and should make for a great warmup and introduction to the game's abilities before playing against another person.I would recommend this game if picked up on a sale, the default price is a bit much even as a 2-pack. This is compounded by the fact that the Eye of Horus addition to Khet is a seperate DLC and is not included in the base game. The Eye of Horus beam splitter is a must-have piece for some real fun playing Khet, so make sure to snag both during a sale!"

There are only a few kinds of pieces. It is ""turn-based"" so the speed and accuracy of my movements are irrelevant.It also stretches the mind in ways that echo chess or go. You can learn the basics quickly, but it would take a while to become ""a master player."" ""Deceptively simple and delightfully complex"" sounds about right to me.This is not the game for everyone. I highly recommend it for people whose taste in games is ""deceptively simple and delightfully complex."""

,Recommended,312720,12474152,"Posted: 13 October, 2014",all,Buddy,"I was two steps from winning and the computer surprised me with a one move win on hard!  Great Job!This is a great game.  As a big fan of Go (igo, Baduk, etc.) this has a good number of qualities of the go game.  First, its rules are simple. Movement of pieces is very simple and can be understood very quickly.  The format of the game is quite logical and without reading the rules, it only took one or two games to understand all the movement and basic strategy of the game. Second, it has some depth to the game play.  It is not so simple to have standard moves (at least not for me yet), though it may at some point for me in the future.  The good thing is that there is a bit of repeatibility in play because of the different setups for the board.I have played on all three board types and I can now definitely say that this game has a good future.  The other board types are quite challenging compared to the first, and the strategy definitely has to change for each board type.  That makes it a bit more interesting since there may be even more unique ways to play in the future.I am quite happy with this game. It mixes the qualities of Chess with go by adopting the simplicity of go, but the faster pace of chess and removal of pieces off the board.  With the rating system, I am also looking forward to playing online at some point.I should also note, having now played the game a bit and beaten the computer AI on Hard level, the pace is not too slow.  Many times when you get into the harder levels, the AI slows considerably.  One of the things I like about this game is that it has a relatively quick pace (can finish a game within 20 minutes easily), and it still maintains some interesting depth.  I assume the elite and impossible levels will get even slower, though.  It is good to maintain a reasonable pace, and I hope the advanced AI games can still finish within an hour.Once I play some online games, I will again, update this review."

Very comparable to chess in complexity and learning curve. Other similarities include gambits, discovered attacks, as well as crucial openings. Unlike chess, you can take out your own pieces, and partly rely on opponent's pieces. A very under-rated game. Beautiful tactics, no limit to improvement. It is an absolute blast, and the Steam version is an excellent adaptation."

It's a fancy and fun twist on the popular 'Chess"" game and much easier to learn and the game typically moves a lot faster as well.Reminds me a LOT of a type-in game from the old COMPUTE! magazine back in the 1980s called Laser Chess!  And ohhh did I love that game back then.  So a modern day ""Laser Chess"" I wondered when I saw this.. I HAD to buy it.  And I am glad I did!Is it a great game for everyone?  Absolutely NOT!I can see a good number of people being bored out of their mind with this game, however if you are one who likes games like Backgammon, Freecell, Chess, and Checkers, then chances are good you'll love this game and think it's worth every penny.Action game lover?

Graphics look a little rough round the edges, but this was never going to be a Graphic game anyway. The AI needs a little tweaking. I am not the best Khet player by any means, but had to ramp up to Hard level in order to get a decent opponent.Not tried out the Multiplayer option yet, but for the price of two pints of beer, I reckon I'll get my monies worth in playing this game"
,Recommended,312720,20796357,"Posted: 27 January, 2016",all,Tekjet,"The core game of Khet is amazing. If you like chess and other strategy board games, you will most certainly like Khet. Unfortunately, this digital version of the game leaves a lot to be desired. The game is very buggy, and crashed multiple times when I was trying to play an online game with a friend. Good news is, that my friend submitted error logs to the developer and he fixed most problems within a day. But there are still some lagging issues. For one, the game will always crash if you have a browser window open that is playing video such as Netflix or Amazon Video. Also, the interface is not very good. Almost every digital version of chess that's ever been released has allowed players to scroll through all the moves made in the game. This is incredibly useful when you are playing an asyncronous game, and you need to refresh your memory on what the last several moves were. This is a feature that is sorely needed in Khet. Even if you are playing a live game and you happen to look away from the screen for a second while your opponent moves, it can be extrememly difficult to try and figure out where he just moved, and there's no way to click back and see. Overall though, I do recommend this game, simply because Khet is such a deep and interesting game. And hopefully in the future, the interface can be fixed with an update. As of January 2016, I would give this game a 6/10. With some interface tweaks and bug fixes, this game would easily be a 10/10."

I liked the Egyptian theme, and am a huge fan of more abstract puzzle-style games such as chess, Go, and Hive. I bought Khet on a whim when I saw that it had support for Linux, and have had a huge amount of fun playing it.The game is very easy to pick up, and you quickly get drawn into plotting out future moves and paths. I very quickly beat the AI on the lowest two levels, but have yet to take on the higher skill levels.The client itself, from the same developer as the also-excellent Hive, is very well done. I'd add a slight wish for keyboard controls that don't rely on the number pad, to support us laptop users, but that's a very minor complaint.All in all, a well-written version of a very fun game, at a low price. Highly recommended."

I've only played up to medium difficulty so far, (only had this game for a couple of days as of this writing) so it appears that the difficulty will be a real challenge.All in all, this is a well-done conversion from boardgame to video game, if you've played Khet in the past as a boardgame, you will like this one.

76561198130621332,Recommended,312720,26528596,"Posted: 10 November, 2016",all,tomasw9,"To summarize in few words - the game is a gorgeous mixture of Chess with Deflektor, taking the best ideas from both. ( (Btw. - does anyone know what the 2nd game is? ;-)a computer game for some 8bit machines from 80's, you may find some free remakes in the net, eg. Deflektor X4)Funs of lasers and even light sabres will realize soon that there is not much of an FPS here ;-) Just a 'boring', almost static board with some 2-colour pieces. And some rules that you have to read about - on how to play and win or lose...Briefly - you have to destroy opponent's Pharaoh. To achieve that you have to use the pieces to reflect a laser beam so that the enemy's Pharaoh is shot with the laser beam. The pieces, depending on their type and orientation (side on which they receive the beam), can either reflect the laser, absorb it without damage or be destroyed. The 2 players play by turns, in which a single piece can be moved or turned. To win the player have to secure his own Pharaoh and find a way either to destroy or to use(!) the enemy's pieces to shoot the other Pharaoh. Before the opponent does it to his of course... So basically often the decision is whether the move can be offensive or defensive (can you afford losing a piece or have to do something to save it, depending on how it affects the situation on the board later - very much like in Chess).So in each move there is plenty of possibilities and silly movements ends badly very soon. If you are not careful you can actually lose after your own move (yes, you can destroy your own 'Pharaoh'... - not like in Chess ;-). And one of the first things you learn is that you have to be careful maybe even more than in Chess - because your pieces might be used against you! So you have to analyse the position and possibilities of the attack using all the pieces on the board - but you can control movement of half, and any move you do can be then used against you! Really cool, heh? ;-)Comparing to the mentioned games the rules are:a lot simpler than in Chess  - very few types of pieces with simple movementmore complex than in Deflektor - but no energy or time limits, as the game is turn-based, not real-timeThe game is surprisingly smooth to learn, ie. much easier and faster to learn than chess. And be warned - the gameplay is kind of addictive. I often started the program just to play one-two games... and yeah, sure... At least an hour gone...Implementation of this kind of game could be very simple (concerning graphics etc), it could be even simple 2D board with symbolic pieces - but most of today's players would not even look at it. So the art part is perfectly OK. (really nothing more needed). Maybe music could be better... Or more ambient (or just could let to choose the genre). But not necessarily, these are really not why you buy and play this kind of game...I'd say it is a game of the best kind - it has simple rules, but the gameplay can be complex and hard to win. And as I wrote earlier - it is easy to start playing it, much easier than Chess (and therefore it is initially more fun I guess; later - it depends...)Those who like logic or tactics/strategy games should be delighted - and especially if you like Chess you will definitely like this one!"

Also the UI could be better, like when you want to rotate a piece, the rotation buttons appear in the corner of the screen, whereas they'd obviously belong right next to the piece. The AI also isn't too stong but in the higher levels it will punish you for obvious mistakes.That being said, it's a solid game that I can recommend for chess & laser fans.

The AI has several difficulty levels, and will scale from the novice to the experienced player nicely. Games are quick, playing out in 5 or 10 minutes.As a multiplayer game, the problem is that there's almost no-one else playing at any given time.

Every bug or question has been answered and followed up and as far as I know, has been solved. The bugs that I have encountered seem to be fixed now.So thumbs up for the developer!Read my original message for the rest of the game:This game certainly has its flaws, but it is a very nice game and its core usually works.At this time of writing, I experience crashes every time I try to do a rematch. No problem, I go back to the main menu and start a new game. One time, I had a crash mid-game (and I think I was winning). Too bad.But the devs seem to listen to these complaints and I am hopefully waiting for the next update.To talk about the game itself:- I didn't know the board game before this game came to Steam, so I can't tell wether it is a good replacement for the board game, but I actually believe that it must be because I can't think of anything the board game could have more.- The graphics aren't great, I don't mind and neither should you because you don't play this kind of game for AAA graphics but for the experience. Still, it would, in my opinion, be an improvement if the graphics were better because it pleases the eye.- The AI on EASY mode is way too easy, play it only to get started. But also on MEDIUM, the AI seems to be an idiot. Yesterday, I won on HARD and had the feeling that the AI should have seen it coming.

This has extra depth over comparable abstract strategy games and the rules are complex enough to puzzle over but simple enough to learn quickly. My only complaints are about the application rather than the board game: you cannot save move histories from a game (e.g. chess notation) and you can't spectate other peoples' games. These two features would make this game perfect in my eyes.
