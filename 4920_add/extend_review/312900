,Not Recommended,312900,13858236,"Posted: 5 January, 2015",all,DaedraBetty,"Initially I was having a great time pretending to be a gorilla busting out of confinement, and being a ferocious tiger, attacking the trainer I once loved, was more than thrilling. And giraffes!? I love giraffes, and trampling over the poor souls of those I imagined looking at me with wide eyes was amusing to say the least.What more, Zoo Rampage has 45 achievements, all seemingly possible to attain, however, moving through each level is neccesary for those achievement hunters.I've put nearly two hours into Zoo Rampage and have only been able to play two of the seven levels. A set amount of points is neccesary to pass each level, and each time I played, it seemed I would be just under the requirement. Granted, the game does have the option for local co-op, which would probably make things easier, however, I have no real life friends.The developers recently updated the game, making it more difficult, as players were reporting that it was too easy upon its release. It's no longer easy. It's damn hard. A difficulty setting would surely cure this ailment and keep more people playing beyond an hour or so.It pains me to give Zoo Rampage the big fat thumbs down because it had it's moments. It was fun while it lasted, but Zoo Rampage became to frustrating, and I just gave up."

When children are screaming for icecream and balloons. And humans gazing at us as if we are cute cotton stuffed animals. Select your favourite animal and within 3 secs you gonna breakout in an unstoppable rampage. Look how fast these little monkeys can run. Wahahaha. Remember how they've thrown litter and peanuts after us? Now it's your payback time. Ram their fat bottoms into the sky. But pls beware of the guards that want to taze you and frame you again. How many years you've been waiting for a decent haystack of genuine African savanna grass? Now they get paid double and twice. Epic explosions like in a Michael Bay movie, breaking walls and collapsing buildings. Armageddon in your favourite place of shallow entertainment. What a hellish good fun. After playing this game you'll never touch Jumanji again. Doesn't matter if it's repetive, buggy or mobileware. The chance for revenge is there and you should take it now. Do it! Don't let your dreams be dreams. Liveout with over a dozen different deadly animals your slapping sprees (actually noone dies)."

Do you remember those days as a kid, pretending to be a lion or a tiger, chasing your friends...  Remember that one time the friend decided to put a sewing needle on the end of the Nerf bow and arrow kit... yes I still have the scars....  If you did these things above... this game is probably for you...Very cheap, fun and casual... Zoo Rampage is just what it sounds like, you choose an animal and go on a rampage.. racking up a high score, killing Tourist, and generally wrecking things.  Think of Rampage with less Giant Mutated monsters and more like real life animals crashing a Zoo exhibit.The game isn't the longest game ever, you can probably do everything in the game in under 4 hours, but the price is low and you'll find yourself going back to replay it even after you've unlocked all the content..."

Otherwise, read on...This is what happens when zoo tycoon meets turbo dismount, but without much of the fun bits.  It was fun the first time, and admittedly the quick progression of achievements got me for a bit longer than I thought it would, but ultimately the novelty wore off in about 30 minutes.  I think if it is on sale for less than US$1 or in a bundle, then it is good.  Else, you will be disappointed.  Little replay value, especially if you are like me and have less than 10% of the gamepad skills of a 12 year old (oh and you NEED a gamepad.  WASD controls are abysmal for this kind of game), and because my gamepad skills are weak I replayed most levels several times until on one I just stopped - game stopped being fun - and maybe I will play more of it another day, and perhaps someday finish...?NO at $3.995/10 at <$1"
,Recommended,312900,11277533,"Posted: 16 July, 2014",all,SpyroGuy,"I'm surprised that it took that long for game developers to discover the enormous potential lying in this concept. After playing countless hours of both Zoo Tycoons and Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis, the best part of the entire experience was when I set my animals free in my 100%-ishly built park and let them demolish it to dust (also eat the visitors in JPOG and get a Game Over mere minutes after completing the very same park, lol).This game is incredibly epic, but it could use some (MUCH) more content and if you look at the price tag, you'll understand what I mean. There's just so much potential in it I don't even know where to begin (tons of more maps, animals, game mods, leaderboards, online functions, Freakin' Dinosaurs like in good old Zoo Tycoon (2) and the list goes on).I really hope that it'll eventually get more content, otherwise it won't entertain you for too long as the entire game can be completed in less than an hour and with a single playthrough you can get almost every achievements.That aside I really like the concept and it's arcade-ish feel, but I played flash games longer than this one.I recommend to everyone who are reading this to wait for a discount and Dear Developers, be sure to expand the experience! :)"

It has some easy to medium achievements to receive. This makes it a good game for achievo hunters, but some of them might be hard to get.The game itself though, is too short, and not much fun by yourself. There is local-co-op that looks fun, but i only live by myself so not to try it with other people. Anwyays, take my review as you please. This is why i do not recommend this game:Too shortTo easy to beat some parts, but other parts very hard...the difficulty changes level to level.Also, only get this game on sale, it is not worth it full price."

I don't know if I've laughed quite so hard for the first five minutes of any game I've ever played, so that's my $2.79 (on sale) well spent.A good, short, jump-in/jump-out ""rage"" game to give you a nice, quick shot of catharsis rather than taking it out on the roads or innocent bystanders. Hell, if only our so-called ""world leaders"" could learn to play stupid♥♥♥♥♥video games like this one, we may even achieve something vaguely akin to world peace.

,Not Recommended,312900,11321005,"Posted: 19 July, 2014",all,shinebox,"Bought Zoo Rampage on a whim to play local multiplayer with against a friend of mine. It was entertaining for probably 1-2 minutes before we had seen all the game has to offer. For $10, that's just not enough.It's a terribly imbalanced game - every round can be determined immediately by whoever is closest to the the largest building/group of cars. The first person to get to that gets a ton of points in the first 20 seconds and then the rest of the round is meaningless.The other (non-destruction) modes seem like they were never playtested even once - the soccer mode is a joke because the players get completely stuck on each other whenever they come in contact, making it very difficult to move around.Unfortunately, it's just a mediocre game that doesn't quite make it into the ""so bad it's good"" category.I'd say skip this one unless you think 2 minutes of mild entertainment is worth $10."

,Not Recommended,312900,13517737,"Posted: 22 December, 2014",all,maplesyrupghost,"It's pretty bad.Maybe with multiple people playing it there might be a bit more fun but as is it's not really much of a game.Sure it's fun to smash and destroy, the whole concept of the game is great and the physics is spot-on, they really have a nice game in theory but there's a few really limiting factors.You only get to play for 1 minute at a time.  You can basically destroy everything in the scene in that minute, or at least most of the destructables, but you have to play the levels over and over again until you get a high enough score.  The satisfaction of destroying a few buildings is removed when you have to repeat yourself like that.  There's even a thread in the discussion area of people trying to build strategies on how to pass the first level, it took me quite a few tries to get past it.  The novelty of smashing wears off quick.What would be more enjoyable, is if the levels were huge.  Maybe like an entire Zoo, or small town?  The destruction and chaos would be a bit more of a thrill if there was more exploration to it, but I understand you only have so big of a viewing window to work with and with 4 players on screen this is pretty much all you can expect.  You will have just as much fun looking at screenshots than actually playing.So I don't know what the game needs exactly, but it's not game of the year.  For the price, it's a high quality piece of work and if you plan on playing it with friends you guys are going to have a blast 60 seconds at a time.  Have fun."

The game round is only 2 minutes, yet within 30 seconds the appeal wears off. There is a lot that could be done to improve it, but whether the developer does or not remains to be seen.
