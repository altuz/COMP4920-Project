I had a terrible issue where the frame rate would just tank all the time, wasn't because of my rig as it is good enough for this game.Posted on the forums, had a terrible feeling we were getting another shoddy pc port of a game, dev replied within minutes of me bringing up the issue and told me how to fix it for the mean time and that there would be a patch in the next day that would fix the issue completely.So the quick fix worked and true to the devs word a patch was released the next day that took care of the glitch and there were no more frame drops.Now to the review itself. Big Ant and Tru Blu really do have to be commended for the product that they've released. As a small time dev and publisher they've released a game that can be held in the same regard as fifa and the 2k series, despite the modest budget that they had to work with.Everything about the game of rugby league is captured in this digital rendition. Players behave like they should, they move like they should, and they mostly look like their real life counter parts.The game has all of the official players and teams for the southern hemisphere but not for the North, depending on where you live this is either going to be a problem or not one at all, and even in saying that, there is the awesome fan hub which allows you to download created players that other people have made, some of them are truley awesome and look like the real people they are based off of, so getting the right players for the northen hemisphere should be no trouble at all.The game has all the usual content you'd expect from a sports game. Quick match, online, career and so on, but it's the options like being able to take control of your favourite superstar and guide him through his career or take a rookie from the age grades on up to representative footy that make this game even more fun than it already is.During your season you will be faced with optional challenges to raise your clubs finances, like completing so many tackles or fends in a match, these finances help when you're trying to lure the next super star to your club for the next season as you have players coming off contract, but these optional challenges are not actually required for you to be able to recruit and don't break the game in anyway.You'll also have the a few judiciary hearings along the way as no doubt your players are going to get pinged for wreckless tackles and face suspension, another facet of the game that just adds to the realism, being able to decide how you plead is icing on the cakeThe graphics for this game are really good, the game has amazing IQ and is capable of supporting 4k resolution should you have the machine capable of running it.The commentary is sadly mostly the same as the Rugby League Live 2 with Andrew Voss and Gus calling the plays, It's not too bad and is actually a lot better than other games that you'll playThe sound is great at capturing the atmosphere of a real life footy game. What with the sound of the excited fans the explosions of fire works when someone goes over for a try or when a forward crunches into a would be tackler, and it's even better with a good pair of headphones.If there was one negative that really needs to brought to attention it'd be the fact that the game has to be online to be played. I can understand why the dev and publisher took this route though, League is niche game and piracy eating into already small sales would cripple this franchise and bring about the end of future pc releases.All in all this is a fantastic sports game and shouldn't be avoided if you're a fan of League. Even comparing this game to the rugby union games that have been released in recent months and years just shows that you don't need a ""AAA"" budget to accuratley capture the heart and soul of  a game, just a dev that wants to please the fans and put out something that they're proud off.I have no doubt that Big Ant and Tru Blu are very proud of this, and they have every right to be."

,Recommended,312920,18258610,"Posted: 29 September, 2015",all,warriorsrule,Worth the money. The PC version of this game feels so much better for some reason. The graphics look crisp and nice and the game takes a bit to learn but once you get the hang of it you will have a lot of fun. There are a lot of game modes and the Be a Pro Career / Coach Career modes will keep you going for a long time. One of the things that I love about Big Ant is that they continuously support their game with patches. Don Bradman Cricket 14 still gets updates more than a year after its release and fixed many issues and added wonderful gameplay. So if there are bugs in Rugby League Live 3 they WILL be fixed by Big Ant. On the whole the miniscule issues do not detract from the gameplay and fun experience.

(with Vsync 60fps)After playing the previous release, 'Rubgy League Live 2' on PS, I find this game runs 10x more responsive and makes you easily choose you're next player/setup for the next play. I wouldn't say this makes it more easy but, enables you to make the choice you actualy wanted happen on execution.The Tutorial\Practice mode is great and more helpfull (yet a bit confusiing at first, wait for visual comand prompts before acting) than the previous released game.A truely great day one release for PC in this multiplatform era.I hope to see more from 'Tru Blu Games & Big Ant Studios' in the future (condidering there quality standards), including expanding on there type of genre's in video games.A nice 2x thumbs up for me!Enjoy :)     -NOTE: Persons who do not like sport games MAY not like this game."

I'll always try to catch State of Origin when ever it's on, but aside from that I'm mainly a union bloke. However, I've gotten sick of Rugby Challenge 2 and decided to try this game out. It's fun and easy to pick up. One thing I don't like however is contesting for the ball is extremely hard. Also, you can't seem to change your teams kicker. Hopefully this will be updated.

Overall they got it right, tackles have weight to them, you can produce fantastic and interesting plays to score an amazing try.  Some minor problems with the defence, the AI can sometime cut through your defence like a knife through butter, but im sure with additional patches this will improve. The career mode is fantastic and versitile. The difficulty levels are very challenging, not like fifa where you can have it on the hardest difficulty after 2 weeks. After amateur you will be at pro level for quite a while.You can pick your favourite super league or nfl team and win all the trophies or you can pick teams from 2 leagues below and work your way up... plenty to do. The customisation on this game is fantastic and really is a huge selling point. With the ability to create players, referees and even whole teams then share them throughout the online community.Missed opportunities - Cannot create plays.  This would of been a great touch, to be able to create runs and markers ect. It lost marks on its defencive play, no world cup option and the main one - Ive NEVER played an online match because no matches are ever available.

Extensive licensing and a reasonably deep career mode make this a very enjoyable game to play, especially with your mates.Main criticisms:- Glitches like how players are locked into running in the direction they are facing when the hooker passes the ball and this sometimes leads to a forward pass being given- Commentary gets boring after a while-Limited variety in end cutscenes, whether it be a pre-season friendly or winning the Grand final, they're basically the same"

If you are struggling I really recomend you stick at it and try to improve yourself at the game because once you do the you will end up playing some really competitive matches against the cpu.

This game can be huge fun, but the negatives outweigh the few things they have gotten right. It is obvious the devs aren't real fans or particularly knowledgeable in the sport, but they are the only ones bothering to get a Rugby League game out there. Lots of fixes need to happen, who knows if they will, they really need to listen to fans of the sports that know how the game should flow. It's definately not worth US$60 or whatever It was I paid, crazy to think this game is up there with the cost of some triple A games. It's worth AUD$30 at most, so if you want to buy it I hope that's what you can find it for. I recommend it with a catch, we should support this game in order to get a better game in the future, but you might throw your controller through your screen as well."
76561198094281335,Recommended,312920,18817267,"Posted: 1 November, 2015",all,Nedge,"Good rugby game but not without flaws, graphically it's great and it has good gameplay options as well as a fantastic 'Fan Hub' section. The inclusion to add community created teams and players is excellent.I love the indepth player a team customisation as well as the facilities to create custom leagues and tournaments.However the gameplay in matches is not all that great, bodering on awful. The passing is a massive hit or miss experience, usually ignoring the button press entirely especially when a quick pass is needed. You'll find your player just carry on running rather than pass or pass many times in quick succsession until he thrwos it out of bounds.Alternativly when you are on a break the opposing AI can grab you at any angle from seemingly any distance, going from facing the wrong way to an instant 180 and bringing you down. The few feet between players is ignored allowing the opposing team to morph the gap and grab you, allowing no real pacing breaks or runs. Because this isn't Union there is only 5 attempts per passge to try and get a run going. Another dead option is the drop ball, if you manage to catch the high ball your player is instantly barraged and the sloppy pass system means you lose a passage of play.There needs to be an auto player switch on tackles or at very least an overhaul. It takes a lot of learning to get the right player in the right place and make the tackle, a little automated help would go a long way as it really interupts the flow of the game. The manual switching especially at harder difficulties is pretty shambolic, finding a lot of times a breaking run will occur because the switching has skipped the last player in play, frantically watching your player marker skip through the entire team. There is an option to skip to player closest to the ball but i find myself wondering what ball the computer thinks is in play, most of the time i'm running at the ball boy.The 'tutorial' section is more like a challenge section with not enough of the games basics covered, a practice zone would of been better suited. With a game featuring this many rules and possible plays, a tutorial is a must, especially how to change the tactics which are scarcely mentioned. Look in the options for gameplay controls and find all the buttons and what kicks you can perform in there, this does a better job teaching you the game than the tutorial section.There is a humungous leap in difficulty from Rookie to Amateur, it feels like beginner to pro in one quick leap, offering no subtle difficulty change meaning you will jump from dominating with no retaliation to instantly held and losing.I'd barely recommend it, it can be fun but the issues with gameplay are just game destroying at times. Everything but the rugby is done well."

Okay it may have its fair share of bugs and annoying glithes but none of that matters because this is the perfect representation of Rugby League in game form ever made. I love the new inclusion of Player Carrer where you can take a rookie player from the lowest of leagues (even the Kingstone league one, oh yeah I'm English by the way) all the way to the top and represent your home nation. Mentioning myself being English leads me onto one slight downside of the game, Why are Super League teams so lowly rated? Don't get me  wrong, I understand that the Super League isn't level with the NRL but seeing teams like St.Helens; Wigan Warriors; and Warrington Wolves so poorly rated compared to lower end NRL teams annoys me, hopefully this may be fixed by a roster update sometime in the future. I know in reallity that this game isn't on par with other top end sports games but it has give me hours of pure entertainment and I'm sure it will continue to for years to come. In conclusion, I would recommend this game to any fan of Rugby League, no matter their location in the world (How are England only rated 3 1/2 stars? We even just showed New Zealand how to really play the other week :-D ) Yes the price is a little steep, but to me it was worth every penny, if you prefer wait till it comes on sale, but please give it a go because I'm sure you'll enjoy it just as much as I do!"

The difference between Rookie (the lowest) and Amateur (the next one up) is like the difference between fighting a baby cat and a full grown tiger, and there's like four more difficulties on top of that. I only tried playing on Legend (the highest) for about twenty minutes. If you can play and win on Legend regularly, try to contact either Mal Meninga or Laurie Daley as you are probably qualified to play in the next State of Origin (Please be advised that you must be from NSW to apply for the NSW Origin team. State restrictions do not apply in QLD.)Tutorials are horrendously poor. If you aren't already very familiar with the rules, field positions and basic strategy of Rugby League, this game will make no effort to teach you. The 'drills' are presented as training, but in actual fact they are more like particularly difficult challenges no new player in their right mind will be able to accomplish. They are quite fun to go back and attempt after a bit of experience, though.Very minor occasional graphical glitches, like the player's foot sometimes getting stuck in the pitch and shaking as the game tries to decide whether you should be in the ground or on it. This so far has not affected gameplay and is a purely cosmetic issue."

This is my go-to game when I have downtime. It's quick, and I can jump in and play without much commitment. It's a great sports game and best of all, about Rugby League.I know alot of people seem to hate on this game (for whatever reason) -- but I've never found the difficulty hard -- even on Veteran/Legend difficulty. It's all about using the tools the game provides like setting your defensive line and selecting the right players.This game deserves much more credit than it is given --- it's an EA quality game by a much smaller studio. The graphics are amazing (that grass never fails to impress me in game), and the mechanics work well mostly.There are some things that needed fixing of course, like accidental off-side (on the opponent's team) -- and things like accidental knock-on if a pass is thrown into an opponent etc --- but for the most part I actually enjoy making the ""AI"" errors -- it adds authenticity.How many times have you seen your team make a stupid pass that goes to noone?

They've already made positive changes to the game e.g. the AI doesn't fling the ball around as much as they first did.Neither good nor bad* Career mode is solid although not much depth to it* Playing a season is good but game doesn't have the depth of ageing, youth development etc. that you get with the multi-million pound projects like FIFA, but that's a minor issue considering how desperate I was for a decent rugby game)Cons- Occasional squad and roster disruptions when you download teams (this can be remedied by deleting official clubs which returns the squad back to its default state)- Some player look-a-likes aren't that great (this is more of an issue with the UK teams, which I'm more familiar)- Player ratings in the Super League a bit out of date e.g. Alex Walmsley rated 79 (minor quibble though that)- Custom players seems to be an issue as I can't create new onesOverall I love it.

The menus and presentation are slick and apart from a couple of very minor UI issues (like why would I want to play as any other team during career mode? Why do I have to keep rechoosing my team each week?) but these are all minor and the devs seem to be patching already (day one).The graphics are stunning, and it all runs very smoothly (over 100fps on my GTX970)I'd go as far as to say this looks and feels like a FIFA or 2K title.The gameplay is tough and whilst there are Drills which help improve the basics you'll have to figure out the rules and tactics of the game as you go along.It has all the key elements of a modern sports sim, with a My Player career mode, coach career mode, exhibitions, leagues and multiplayer etc.The sound is pretty realistic and on the whole very authentic, with some great bone crunching tackles. The commentators aren't quite as varied as their FIFA/2K counterparts but they are a million times better than Blood Bowl 2...If you follow Rugby League I'm guessing you aren't reading this because you're too busy playing this game, if you like sports games but aren't sure about League or this game you should jump in!"

I will add I have never played a RL game before More of a Union fan.However as there is NO decent RU games out there I gave this a try and was So So happy I did.Positives:1.Graphics are great comparable to any AAA sports title. I have had no drop in FPS or any issues with a 3 year old rig on higher settings.2.Gameplay is smooth and as far as I am aware pretty accurate to RL play style. tackles are fun and you haev a lot of options of set plays and tactical calls re defence alignment etc.3.Content - the create a player most games have these days its as detailed as I would want without being over the top. Carrer mode can swap between manager, existing ""superstar"" or your created player which gives it a fresh take.Cons:Very few. However if I was being picky.1. Key mapping/bindings I am happy playing with a controller but I would have thought its not challenging to allow me to alter my controls. I usually play with Keyboard but without key mapping its impossible. Key mapping on controller perhaps not as important but would be preferred.2. Attacking set plays: such as Switch, loop moves and miss moves. You can elect to throw a pass 1, 2,or 3 players out but thats it really. Considering there is defensive tactical alignment and altering defensive lines etc I would have hoped for a slightly more detailed attacking system. currently the attacking ""set play"" consists of two types of backline set up for kicking options Thats it. The rest is free for all.Overall though its a really fun game with a lot of content, completely meets my needs for a rugby fix. Would recommend."

With the ai tackling you something they hold you down longer and they do not get a pentaly called against them but somes they do get it called would like to see that fixed up. i think the devs should fix up the minor details and bugs still left in the game instead of being the now yearly update becasue of the new teams and rosters."

Using heavy hits compared to normal tackles there is no difference in the long run. You wont injure or tire the other players.The enemy team will change defensive and offensive strats to lock a player down. Your team wont.Hit ups are just stupid. You can run straight at another player and knock him down but in the time it takes for the animations to play you will get tackled everytime. You can't just run over them and keep going.You can get ball stripped from you but it is near impossible to strip the ball yourself.The script for tackling your player for enemy team can trigger from 10-15 metres away so you can't avoid tackle at all. Often the script for enemy tackling you will over ride the script for you passing even though you will have planty of time to pass.Running into a pass from a team mate will nearly always trigger a forward pass. This needs fixing bad.The career mode has had no effort put into it. I'll give some examples. In NBA2k games and other games you take interviews after matches and talk to other player and cinematics trigger during career decisions. You get none of that here.I'd give this game a 4/10 even being a footy fan. Not worth the $40 I paid. Maybe worth about $10.
76561198208284245,Recommended,312920,28851528,"Posted: 30 December, 2016",all,dbradley88,"A very nicely made game. I also have Don Bradman Cricket 14, and i have to say Big Ant are very good at making sports games. Both games are amazing representations of their sports.I recommend playing career mode at first, and maybe try a few positions (muliple careers). Once you understand the buttons and roles of each position, you will be better at running the whole team at once.If you want to goal kick play no.4. I play fullback and its a nice way to play it, coz you are always behind the play in defence and attack, which is the best view, and you can inject yourself as you please tackling or attacking. Just remember to drop back for the kick on the last tackle!The AI range from stupid to very good and hard. Depends on the skill level. On the lowest they might run away from you instead of tackle you a lot, 1 good fend you are through the line. Amateur (next level up) is a nice level, they are smarter but not impossible to get through while you are low skills. Pro and above, you need to build up your skills first or you wont get through their defence. Yes, you can change skill levels any time during your career.I dont rate people's opinions when they have only played for a few hours. or if they trash the game because they didnt read it needed a controller to play.If you wont go out and buy a controller to experience this game its your loss. I strongly recommend an XBox controller. The game's controller setup is XBox by default. Works lovely if you have the controller. All XBox controllers i know of work on PCs too. TBH i cant imagine wanting to play it without an XBox controller on a PC. These days you need a controller for pretty much any sports games. If you dont want to buy a controller, dont buy sports games. They would be crap to play on a keyboard i reckon.Its an awesome game and the best NRL game ive seen to date. It is immersive, addictive and very well done. People who rate it down are either too stingy to buy a controller, tried playing pro on thier first game and just werent anywhere near up to it (and it made them sad), or tried the lowest skill level which is ridiculously easy and the AI do more stupid stuff.Highly recommended for NRL fans."

There's no keyboard option.I write this review as a massive RL fan and RLL fan, having put hundreds of hours into RLL 1 and 2.RLL 1 and 2 were not perfect games and had a lot of bugs which were very frustrating. The biggest in my opinion, being the inevitable intercept if you attempted a cut out ball in RLL2 (I'm sure fans of the series know of what I speak). However they were very playable and very fun. The career mode in RLL2 was clearly modelled of FIFA and that is a good thing. The graphics weren't groundbreaking, but for the most part you could recognise the faces of the players.Now, to RLL3. It is essentially a reskinned version of RLL2, with the intercept bug fixed. Unfortunately, a series of new, increasingly frustrating bugs emerged. All of the players have the same, unrecognisable beat up looking face (I think they resemble Sam Burgess), and the game is either frustratingly difficult or way too easy, depending on difficulty setting.Defending: If you play it on pro or veteran, a high ball is undefendable, Your opponent will score almost every time. It has the illusion of you being able to compete for the ball, but you will almost never win.If you are engaged in a one on one strip. You will lose. Nothing stops it.You can not select your fullback to stop a line break. It will stick with the winger or whoever was initially in pursuit, despite your best button mashing efforts and yelling at the screen. If you do manage to use your fullback as a last resort, it's 50/50 as to whether he will make the tackle, or be stepped or run over the top of. There is no combatting this, despite attempting new strategies.Your markers will appear to be on an onside position, however will occasionally suddenly become offside when you attempt a tackle, giving away a penalty. This happens too often.Attacking: Rarely will you be able to produce a decent linebreak, and even rarer will you have anyone in support if you do.The forwards do not go forward and are tackled imiediately when contact is made.There is no longer an option to run with the dummy half as he is immediately tackled, so it's pointless.Offloads? Negative. You'll pull one off as often as a rocking horse takes a dump. The controls are unresponsive. You can attempt a pass just before taking a hit up, but nothing will happen and you will be tackled with the ball. This allows almost no second phase play.If you attempt to pass from the ground after winning the scrum, you will either throw it on the ground or it will be a forward pass to someone in the scrum. You have to physically carry the ball away from the scrum before risking a pass. By then, any chance of a decent backline play is gone.The only way I can get field position is to attempt 40/20s. They are only possible during one half of the game when the wind is on your side, or don't try it. Even then, you will often over kick it and it will go out on the full, because the controls are very hit and miss.Player management: You cannot select a goal kicker! It will choose one for you. Usually the playmaker, even if their kick stats are poor.Career mode: Coaching. The FIFA model used so fluidly by RLL2 is gone. There's little in the way of choice and it seems way too ""locked in"" with your choices.Career mode. Rookie superstar.  You can only control one player in this mode. His stats will only improve if he has his hands on the ball. So, you either spend the whole game trying to get into a position to receive the ball (and then get tackled immediately as I already described), or your player just won't improve. He also gets subbed real quick if he doesn't touch the ball. That is out of your control.Rookie/Novie mode etc. Give the ball to any player and they will run the length of the field and score everytime. It becomes a borefest. There's no satisfying middle ground between too easy and impossibly hard.In summary, I could put on RLL 2 and play all day (spent many a hungover Saturday doing just that). This game, I struggle to finish more than 2 games, and that's after several rage quits. I keep coming back to it every month or so hoping for a different experience, but I get frustrated and bored just as quickly.Give this game a try simply because there's no other Rugby League video game franchises, but prepare to be frustrated."

Only downside I can see is lack of support like automatically updating rosters and player ratings without having to do it through the community hub.> Signing players in career coach is far too easy and allows you to build an super overpowered team in two years.> The player point rating in matches is really skewed to outside backs who score tried often.> Some positions are nearly unplayable in career rookie (hooker, lock) because the stamina drains far too quickly for doing any tackling, being tackled.There's a ton of small changes I'd make in regards to mechanics and flow of the game but there are far more things it does excellently.After 250 hours, I can't wait for the next installment to see improvements and what new mechanics they implement."

That said, I think RLL3 suffers from a lack of polish.The good thing is that they have managed  to create a reasonably challenging game here, the bad news is that the way they have achieved it feels unfair and does not proomote creativity. The biggest problem with the game for me is the pacing which feels like it affects eveything else. A slow game speed option would probably go a long way to improving things along with a rework of how ratings affect outcomes.Too often, a knock on will lead to the opponents prop picking up the ball and running the distance for a try. Fullback positioning is terrible. Offloads have to be well timed and feel like too much of a lottery in comparison to reality. The passing game is stifled by a flat backline and the occurance of errors. What the game rewards you for is playing simple footy and trying to beat your opponent one on one with a side step or a fend - which is fine, but the lack of other options makes it a little boring. I think the problem stems from the lack of ability to establish a realistic and entertaining offensive game without it being overpowered against the AI programming, which is a shame. What we have is still rugby league, although one dimensional and repetitive. If you love sports games or Rugby League its probably work checking out."
