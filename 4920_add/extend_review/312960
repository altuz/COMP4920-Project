76561197970490287,Recommended,312960,11991971,"Posted: 5 September, 2014",all,CappinCanuck,"From the outset, I like this game.  It does what it sets out to do very well.  That said, I won't be playing it because it's not my style of game.  It's not a space 4x game but a casual simplistic strategy came set in a space theme.What the game appears to be from the advertising is a simplified, casual, 4x turn-based space strategy game.  It isn't.  I could really enjoy a game like and keep playing it for a lengthy period of time.  It needs to have just a few more mechanics and a few more complexities to be a 4x.  For example, there is no eXplore in this 3x game.  That goes along with no research, no empire management, no ship customization, no planetary development.  Well, heck, it's not a 4x game at all!  That's my one warning, you will be very upset if you buy this expecting that (yes, I know it says it on the store page advert, honestly I don't know why they would advertise it as such).  Let me explain what it actually is.It's a space themed table top strategy game.  It's Risk with space ships on a check board.  No more complex than that.  It's not a 4x, not Endless Space, nor MOO, nor SOTS, nor Stardrive, etc.  It's a bad decision to advertise it as this genre.  You have a checker grid of planets with each having a set number of Resource points.  Capturing the planet means you gain those resource points each turn.  Each planet can construct ships and the cost is subtracted from your resource bank.  You have cards with some strategic value, i.e. your ship will suicide next battle and kill itself and all enemy ships, which can also be traded for resources.  There are essentially two races, the Empire and, essentially, rebels/Pirates.  They have different play styles whereas the Empire has stronger ships, combat strength and health, they take longer to build and more resources.  The Pirates have weaker ships and take less turns to build.  So the pirate early game is sprawl as fast as you can before the Empire starts coming.  The ships are each different resource costs, turns to build and stats.  The battles are simply graphical representations of the stat calculation.  It's like Civilization 5 where you have one unit attacking another, animations ensue, and the victor remains.  That's the game.  That's all there is.It's a deeper checkers in Space. Perhaps that's unfair.  It's a very complicated Checkers game in space.  Think of the genre as on a range of complexity from a tabletop stragegy game to your traditional, archetypal, 4x PC game like MOO.  Within the table tops you can go from as simple as checkers to as complicated as Risk.  Your 4x games, I would say Endless Space would be the simplistic title, MOO/Sword of the Stars in the middle and the spreadsheet game of MOO3 as the most complex.  This game falls squarely in the complex table top game category and doesn't even touch the simplistic 4x scale.  That's what you're buying.  Don't expect a simpler Endless Space or even a casual 4x title because you'll be disappointed.What it does though, it does right.  The UI is crisp and looks good, the ships look good as does the space background.  Next to no game breaking bugs so far after 2 hours of gameplay and multiple play throughs.  Your games will last from about 10 minutes - 45 minutes.  It's very much a pick up and go strategy title.  For me though, it's still space checkers -- where you can own tiles you were on and build more checkers on them and each time you jump another player there's a battle based on numbers.  I'd recommend this for casual players and table top players, not necessarily 4x players.  There is a little polish lacking, it's day one after all, with some stuttering in the panning and some funky zoom decisions (click on planets to move around map, forget panning or zooming).  Also, damage on ships is hard to see or even even keep track of since it's not represented graphically or shown on the galaxy screen nor battle screen.  The other reviews criticised the game for having a scout take out a cruiser, fair enough, they can when your cruiser has 1 shield point left but you'd never know it during the battle.  That sort of detail isn't quite polished in yet.  I think $15 is a fair price point, $20 is pushing it in its current state, but maybe when it gets more polished and maybe with a little more content."

Every turn it gives you a summary of the action in the last turn and the statistics were not telling me about the ships I lost. Combat is simplified kind of like the Civilization games, this combat is a little confusing; much of the time it will show my ship destroy the other one and find out it had destroyed my ship as well.I do like the game and with a little work these things will probably get smoothed out in a few patches until them I can't recommend this to anyone.Lastly this is not a 4x game, there is no research and there is no diplomacy I could find."

I was wrong.  If a game has mostly negative reviews, guess what, it isn't a good game.I tried 3 games:Game one, team play.  I lost track since another player and my units were the same color and it just turned into a muddled mess.  Hello, shouldn't the colors be the players rather than the factions?  And my teammates ships as well as my own would both be around some plantets, and I could not tell them apart.  Sometimes it seemed as if my ships were brighter, sometimes my enemies.Game two, 1-1 with different factions.  I made the mistake of leaving artifacts on in the vicotry conditions.  I won the game after finding 3 artifacts before even having a combat. Not fun.Game three, 1-1 different factions, artifacts off.  The AI proves it'self brain dead.  I took all the plantes.  During the game, I built 53 ships.  The AI? 4. yes 4.  I lost (automated combat) 15 ships to take out his 4. Either he only built tough ships, which is silly in a game where it is all about expanding fast, or he just did nothing.  Either way, too easy and not fun at all.Game four - easy - Uninstall.This game has potential.   I really do think that a major overhaul could save the game.  As it is, pretty much everything about this game, from the way it scrolls to the Custom game setup, which really isn't custom (can't even pick the number of planets, it's dependent on which game you choose) is irritating.Some things that would help custom:  Color choice, planet number choice, difficulty choice.Fix the AI. Fix the colors. Fix the winning conditions. Fix the irritating scroll. Fix just about everything."

In normal gameplay, there are 7 different unit types (6 do combat, 1 upgrades a planet's production), but there's only 1 resource type (aka money, though it's not called that) and only 1 planet type (with production values of 0-2 per turn) that can produce any kind of ship. There are no tech trees and no research, there are no specialized production facilities, there are no terrain types, and battles play out by the strength of your units and the roll of the dice (the battle system is never fully explained).The rules provide for simple tactics: Do I produce weaker ships fast or strong ships more slowly (and can I defend the planet while it is producing)? Can I anticipate and counter enemy actions successfully? The game provides for deathmatch and team modes, both in singleplayer (with AI) and multiplayer.The rules would make this a decent game, but there are various minor bugs, the UI feels unresponsive and cumbersome at times (5 clicks to produce a ship, ship and planet lists not suitable for large numbers), and the manual is incomplete: some features of the game and most notably the battle system remain undocumented.I have played some standard 1-on-1 games against the AI. I always get the same, unbalanced map (layout and assigned production values). The AI always produces ships on undefended frontline planets, and I can mop it up easily with a simple rush. This happens on all levels of AI. It also failed to take two of the good cities next to its base, giving away its production advantage.I expected more of Starion. If you are looking for this type of game done right,Mayhem Intergalacticis slightly more tactical and delivers a better experience."

This is no where near a 10$ title, more like a 1.99 game that you still wait to go on sale. As such, it feels very much like a mobile port.What I liked... Graphically I thought the art team did their job. While nothing amazing or new, it was about average for a mobile level game. Thats about all I liked, but this is what happens when a few artists try to make a game in a genre they know little about.The bad... to avoid a full wall of text ill just make a list.--Achievements dont unlock correctly - some early, some never--I opted to play without sound an hour in as it didn't add anything (changing the sound output also crashed the game)--All ships are available from the start, no tech tree at all--One resource that means nothing to you--Easy to spot bugs, such as capture 10 planets and game tells you that you captured 20--Terraform units, if used too many in a turn they either despawn without doing the job or the game fails to update planet output text- as I've seen mismatched output depending on where you look--The only choice I ever made was to stop bothering to terraform planets as there was no point and its tedious--THE USER EXPERIENCE IS THE WORST I'VE EVER SEEN!! In the credits there were testers... did they play this? How long? Cause holy♥♥♥♥♥♥~~I hope you like to click - if you are a steamroller like me... good luck. You have to move every unit one at a time, one planet jump at a time, each taking 3 clicks min. So my late game turns on a full size map required 500+ clicks until I just stopped moving majority of my units and won with the rest. I never lost a battle but settings might help up the challenge.--And another minor thing, is it a ""turn"" or a ""round""... pick your terms and stick with them.-- The game summary is mostly lies - unless I missed everything by not playing the other ""factions"" so I'll review that real quick:""Leave the tedious, everyday tasks that take away from crafting and executing tactical strategies to your faction as you explore the galaxy. ""--Crafting what? The best ship in the game, that you start with and have no reason to build anything else? That crafting?(This may have been a setting I randomly chose starting my first and only game, if so then my fault)Explore the galaxy map and discover different planet types: some rich in resources, some barren and unfit for terraforming. Expand your empire by choosing which planets to invade, colonize, destroy or simply ignore. Exploit and terraform planets, acquiring resources to grow and strengthen your fleet, empowering you to exterminate enemy factions and rule the galaxy.--What? Every planet I went to was automatically captured, and the only choice left was to bother terraforming it... or not based on 0-1-2 output levels. So you could capture a 0 and make it a 2, thats literally it.""Fully customize each game by creating your own settings so that no two games are the same.""--unless you play more than 2 games (or maybe I broke my settings, as I've mentioned)""Use resources acquired from planets to build and strengthen your fleet""-- A single resource, that is the only currency and comes from every planet equally, there is no benefit or strategy to the planets you take - assuming you have time to terraform. (small map multiplayer would surely change that)""Construct ships that range from small, agile scouts to colossal battle cruisers""-- all of which are available from the start, so you wont... and scout what? With fog on enemy count was viewable, at least for neutrals there wasn't enough AI enemy when I got there 2 hours later to pay attention.""From improved mining to solar eruptions to labour strikes and beyond, implement cards and/or artifacts to make games more interesting with the element of chance""-- never once did I see a card worth the risk of using, I converted all to resources and I didn't need the extra resourcesSome of my opinions may be due to the fact that I only played 1 full game with one faction. Maybe I picked the wrong one, maybe I ruined the game with bad setting (not that I felt there were many options). Still the bugs and click-fest UI were bad enough for me to not load another map. So I do not recommend this game.TLDR; Its bad, just dont. It tries to be 4X but dummed down to 1X with some silly card game thrown in. I would happily perfect game Sins of a Solar Empire again, and I suggest you do that instead."

I am giving it a thumbs up only because it has a 26% approval at the time of this posting. So yes, this is a pitty thumb. I'd give it a 4/10 so it's not great but not the worse thing in the world. It is not worth $10. I got it on sale for $2.50 but I'd try to get it cheaper if I were you.As others have said, this is a board game. I see they removed the 4x tag that was on when I originally bought this game. You move pieces around to capture systems that give you resources you can buy ships with. There's no research. Several of the achievements don't seem to be functioning but that's not here or there.Cons:Limited unit selection. Build cheap units until you run into the other races, then switch to the most expensive ships you can build, repeat.When playing against other generals of the same nation they appear to have the same color. It is terrible trying to find the enemy when they look exactly like you, same color and all. I'd say this is the worse con of them all.No notification during battle. It would be helpful if there was a zoom to lost planet feature.Card system needs work. You can turn this off though so it's not game breaking.Bland settings in game maker. You are stuck with a checkerboard pattern. That's fine for an option but there should be other options that change the shape of the field.Too far zoomed in. You can fit only five planets at a time and there's no mini-map. You can zoom out but as soon as you click on a planet it zooms in terribly close.Scrolling would randomly stop working. The HUD would just stop responding and you have to hit esc and move the mouse in the other direction to get it to work again.Team battles are broken. I haven't tested this personally but other reviews have said that you can't win if your ally gets the victory conditions.Pros:Stable- game never crashed which is what I expected from such a low rated game.Unique - I've never played a game like this.Story- There's a background story to everything in the game. It seems like they were going to make a campaign but changed their mind. Game probably would have been a ton better with a campaign.Quick or long games- At the time of this posting I've done 4 games, lost one due to cards, won two small ones and then one a massive game against 3 on free for all.

Either a typo in the achievement or a bug.- The end game stats were wrong. Claiming no ships were destroyed or lost (maybe because animations were off?)Negative Areas:- The game took some experimenting to figure out the mechanics, but there isn't much to figure out.- No resource management: All your planets generate exactly one resource that goes into a global pool- Battle mechanics are really unclear. It *feels* like risk, where more attack power gives higher dice roll chances. This means weaker armies can win battles.- Everything about the game felt like it was designed for mobile, which is only bad because I have a huge screen and it doesn't take advantage of the full range of inputs (keyboard, mouse) available.- None of the cards seemed worthwhile. Most had random effects, but according to users on the Steam forums some of them can target your own empire, which makes them difficult (actually impossible) to use effectively for strategy.- Most cards obtained were just ""use for a single resource"", but required three clicks to convert.- Not clear when terraformers would work.- The battle animations were dry, and I decided to turn them off in the second game, which effectively turned the game into checkers.- It wasn't clear which ships were moving, or if a ship needed orders to move.- The only way to see which ships are on a planet is to cycle through each one.And the biggest complaint- NO fleet management.  When a planet has 10 ships on it, you need individually select each one and move it. The biggest help is that after choosing to move the first ship, the next ship is already selected for you.Some features that would make it interesting:- Any kind of planet management or customization.  Planets can only produce one of any ship in the game. They also can either be terraformed to boost resources (once), or never.- Any kind of tech tree. All ships are buildable from the start. All planets are colonizable from the start.- Meaningful race differentiation, right now they are too similar.- Planets that matter. Currently all planets are the same, no difference between them.- Better cards that can be used more specifically. Less ""convert card to one resource"" cards.This game really feels like early access, or some kind of beta.  It needs more features to be a worthwhile game, espscially at a $15 price point. The AI isn't challenging, and the game is incredibly flat.  I have seen tactical games with less features but they were considered more deeply for their impact on the overall design and led to a highly focused but ""chess"" like feeling.  This game feels like checkers.  Just move your slightly larger groups of units around one at a time until the enemy is eliminated. It isn't deep and it doesn't feel ""tactical"", just rote movements until ""victory""."

I'll be playing with this one some more, but not nearly as much as I would other more easy to pick up, and play, but deep challenging strategy games."
,Not Recommended,312960,30703661,Posted: 24 March,all,Agathosdaimon,"hmm, i like to give games alot of attention ones that have often received some bad reviews, i dont know why but i like the broken games, provided the developer was making an earnest attempt to make a working and original gamethus i tried starion tactics thinking that maybe its reported simplicity will be its charm, like some classic boardgame - sadly this game only holds this value for may the first few turns of a game, after that it has nothing more to offer and it becomes a chore, as you can only move whatever ships you have only one planet per turn and so when th emap has 98 planets or more, it is just utterly boring and because everything is on a diamond grid  and all looks the same, it is work to find ones specific planet, if say you are building something and need to check its status, - as for building the only thing that can be built is ships, the only planet related thing is a terraformer, but this hardly ever feels necessary"
