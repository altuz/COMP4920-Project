Many of the characters don't even have animations.- No voice acting.- The writing seems very lazy. Many times when I observed a hotspot in a scene I got the default ""Nothing interesting here.""- Very Glitchy. The game froze up on me twice and one of those times I had forgot to save in a while.  There was also a problem where my character would just walk off the screen and this happened a lot.- Short length and the ending seemed very rushed.- Too much sexual innuendo that just isn't very funnyPerhaps it's breaking ground here with it's gay themes but that aside it's really not that good of a game. It feels like a very cheap novelty."

Being a fan of John Waters, I was attracted to what I thought would be ""campy"". In my humble oppinion, this doesnt even have much ""camp"".This game is like buying a novelty from a sex shop. You're never going to actually use it. It's a joke.The game itself lacks any actual gameplay. I grew up playing Space Quest games, and other point and click's. This has no puzzles. If any of it was intended to be puzzling, then it was really easy. The comedy is decent, i'm a huge fan of the innuendo lift, but it really stops there for me.After playing the game for 1.5 hours, I hit a gamebreaking bug. Cannot restore save file. So, I sent my troubleshoots to the dev. I was shocked to actually get a respone.....but here I am almost 2 weeks later and I still do not have a fix for this horribly overpriced novelty of a game.I am all for supporting gay games, but this is just a disgrace.

It's kinda-sorta passable for a funny reddit comment thread, where people joke about point and click adventure tropes. Does it make up for game's other deficiences, can it carry a game by itself? Hell no.So far game made me think exactly zero times, most of the time i just watch protagonist awkardly walk at badly drawn backdrops. Interface is clunky, hotspots are badly set up and the whole experience is rather... tedious.I guess we're still living in the world where ""gay game"" is such a novelty, people eat up products like this and even have something good to say about it just because it happens to be gay.

However, the pricepoint is way too high for such a short game.  You can play through the game in an hour maybe drag it out to 2 or 3.  There's just not enough here to carry the pricetage it's asking.  With so many games to choose from these days, just because it's gay-themed (and hey that's something, I'll give it that) doesn't excuse the lack of content that any other game would be criticized for.  Voice-acting would have been a nice addition as would several more planets to explore along the way.  Maybe if you can find it super discounted at the Summer or Christmas sale it would be worth purchasing.  Maybe."

I bought this game as a laugh to play with my girlfriend, but instead, it turned out to be an engaging story for the short time it lasted. I've noticed that every review for most of the games on this site often contains a lot of personal bias, so I figure I should be fair to this game and to everyone else and show my viewpoint from two different perspectives.As a straight guy examining the game's gender tropes, this game was fun. Characters break the third wall and talk directly to the gamer, a tool that showcases a lot of the games true humor. The most often trope in video games is ""hero saves damsel in distress"", but here, the main goal is a reunion between the main character and a past love interest, who is by no means a damsel. Several other homosexual characters and comments made by them shine a light on how few other video games defy stereotypes and show that relationships can come in any shape or form. I REALLY enjoy a game defiant enough to turn common tropes around. Creativity is really the only thing that keeps game development a fluid marketplace.As a gamer, this game was a short, funny adventure. The nature of the point and click game genre often requires a lot of going back and forth between different areas of exploration, and there are some moments where a detail that you didn't catch may end up making you explore an area you have already been to several more times. The game has a high contrast mode for vision impaired players, a nice touch if you're having too much trouble searching for the right things to grab. However, despite this, the game itself is fairly short; you should be able to finish the whole thing in under a few hours. The art style is not exceptionally thrilling, but the dialogue is hilarious and finding all of the hidden jokes and sexual innuendo was exactly what I expected.All in all, I would recommend this to others, but only if the price for the game falls below $8 or if you have some money burning a hole in your pocket. The ending scene makes the whole game absolutely worth it."

If you have fond memories of games like those, then you'll love ""My Ex-Boyfriend the Space Tyrant"".  It has the same silly comedic style that I'd come to love from those sort of games, only with a gay theme that's suggestive, but didn't go too far... though I'd have been okay if it had!  I really enjoyed this game; it was light-hearted and fun and took me back to when I was a kid.  In fairness, if this had been a non-gay themed point & click adventure, I may not have enjoyed it as much, but since it appeals to me as a gaymer, I was much more willing to overlook some of the minor flaws of the game, the pros and cons of which I've listed below.There are only a few down-sides to this game, one of which being that it was quite short. I finished it playing casually in under 5 hours of total play time.  I wasn't disappointed from a monetary value perspective, but from a gameplay perspective, because I wanted to keep playing.  I only now learned that there's a sequel planned and I really can't wait for the release!=====HIGHS=====- LGBT themed game that makes the story interesting for gaymers- Silly humour that I LOVE, similar to that of the Space Quest / Monkey Island franchises- Suggestive themes that didn't go too far- Amusing story that captured my interest=====LOWS=====- Encountered a game crashing bug one occasion- Short game - finished in under 5 hours of total gameplay- Would liked to have seen a wider variety of items & interactions- Would liked to have seen a wider variety of dialogue choices- Voicing over the game would've added an extra level of funOverall, if you're a gaymer, you'll more than likely enjoy this fun game and get a few good laughs out of it!"

It's silly, over-the-top fun, with some great one-liners, some amusing pop culture references, break the fourth-wall moments, and a space opera to boot.The art, on the whole, suited it, with loud colours and quirky designs, though in places the background art seemed inconsistent with the rest of the game. The music was great and suited the upbeat space opera mood, and the sound effects were unobtrusive and fit the mood well.My only complaints were that at times it felt like it was running slowly; it seemed to take ages for Tycho to walk from one end of the screen to the other, and there were a couple of typoes in the dialogue I noticed. A little more character development would have been nice, too, but for a fun, silly, and slightly surreal game, it was most enjoyable.(I'm seeing a lot of ""I'm offended"" comments on here, or mentions of it being ""unrealistic"": a fair call, but I never felt like the game was meant to be realistic or taken too seriously: it felt like a gay-themed Leisure Suit Larry, which was equally silly and unrealistic in its portrayal of both female characters and heterosexual relationships. While it's nice to have serious games and accurate representation, it's also sometimes nice to have a bit of fun and some smutty humour which isn't really hurting anyone.)"

,Recommended,312970,13806313,"Posted: 3 January, 2015",all,The Phred,"As other reviewers have noted, there's a lot of boring and pointless walking backwards and forwards and back again in this game. Similarly, some dialogue could use work: some opening conversations were relevant earlier in the game, but are bizarre when they're repeated. Surely it wouldn't have been too difficult to throw in a generic greeting?Those are fairly minor squibbles - or should be. The walking, though: slow, frequently illogical, and at times frustrating enough to make me question whether it was even worth continuing. As the lead character thinks later in the game: ""This is going to be a long game."" He forgot to add ""needlessly"".There was some jarring change in artwork at one point late in the game, for what amounted to an extremely lame joke (or at least, that's the only reason I can think of); and I'm still not sure what happened in the grand final scene, other than by imputation: it's almost as if there's a part of the scene missing.On the plus side, the eyecandy is great - Joe Phillips is always reliable! - the humour generally good, and the storyline interesting enough to keep me playing - with enough ""I didn't see that coming""s to keep me on my toes. Some of the puzzle solving, while usually logical, can take a bit of nutting out (although some others are  telegraphed a bit too much).On balance, thumbs-up wins - but it was a close-run thing. And the sad part is, the things that brought this game down were easy fixes. If the game testers had done their job properly, or the developer followed up on their advice, this could have been a MUCH better game.All that said, though, I look forward to the already-overdue next project from this developer: it's nice to have a gay-themed game that is not embarrasingly over-the-top (Joe Phillip's artwork aside, but I happily forgive him that). Sure, some of the dialogue is corny - I'm looking at you, lift - but overall the game is not nearly as corny or stereotyping as some reviewers would have you believe.Having unlocked the alternative play version, will I play the game through again?Yes - but not for a while."

Many people may not like that fact, but that is what the game is about. The game is a comedy above all else, it does not try to take its self too serious, I mean just look at the title of the game. Is it worth a few laughs, yes, and while I did laugh at the gay undertone of the game, I never found the game insulting or rude to the LGBT community. The writing does par off later in the game, and it lose some of its fun, only to pick up a few giggles here and there towards the end.The main issue with the game is that it lacks polish and depth, from proper screen resolutions to sound sliders, and an over all UI smoothness. Even the puzzles are very simple and that may be good for people new to this genre of game. The art style in the game is simple at best, and why I am not amazed at  how this game looks I don't feel I will be taking anything away from it with after beating it.The game is a comedy if you go in thinking its supper dubber serious about it then you will be only upsetting yourself.

Unlike most point n' click adventures, you don't need to combine random objects to solve a puzzle. The objects are fairly logical. However, it doesn't mean the puzzles are easily solved. You do need to think, but not like a developer. The hints for puzzles often come by trial and error, and by interacting with the NPCs. Got something in your pocket? Show it to someone!

There are sexual based puns and innuendo which were fun. There was a lot of going back and forth and I didn’t always have the right ideas. Fortunately I found a walkthrough on YouTube by CinnamonToastKen that helped when I couldn’t figure out what I was supposed to do. For me the ending was bittersweet.This was a fun little game with hot guys and naughty puns.

I say, it isn't worth that much, given I finished it in 3 hours. With so few characters and hours I had hoped for voice overs maybe? I mean, I am a gay gamer and love some gay themed content, so that's a plus, if that matters to you. Overall, I say it is an ok game, but I would buy it only for a discount, not the full 15 Euro."
