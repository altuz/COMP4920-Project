It is a superb game, limited only by a weak marketing, that every serious war gamer should definitely have in his or her stable.Graviteam has clearly been designed by a team with a deep understanding of military tactics and a passion for realism and historical accuracy.I can't praise the game highly enough and I can only say to those of you who have not yet purchased it, or who gave up on Graviteam because of its complexity, that you are missing out on the opportunity to experience and contribute to the finest war simulation ever made."

That is how the game feels once you learn to play it. But you have to learn it, and it takes time, and before you do it won't look or play at all how the pictures feel. When I first bought Graviteam's other game, Operation Star, I had heard good things about it but was sorely dissapointed the first couple times I tried playing. It just didn't seem to ""have it"". I let it go for a couple months.But then I came back, and really tried to learn it. Turns out, I was completely wrong. If you like WW2 and strategy, it's a crime not to devote a couple hours to learning this game if you can. It's one of, if not the best. You just have to give it time, and you will be rewarded."

,Recommended,312980,21744851,"Posted: 10 March, 2016",all,Edox,"Probably the best wargame of this scale around.In this game you get the feeling of being a commander, moving companies and platoons: you aren't the micromanaging-wierdo which we see in many games, where an hypotetical ww2 ""general"" go from soldier to soldier telling him where to aim, take cover behind that rock, switch to that grenade. In Mius Front the AI can handle that, and while you can certainly micromanage the placement of an AT gun in an ambush position, or should the need arise command single squad in a platoon, you do it only when you need it.The game has a turn-based operational layer, where you move platoons and manage your force calling reinforcements from your OOB. When the movement phase ends battles are resolved in the tactical mode, where you not only get to move troops in the field, but can also please your eyes at the really nice graphics, unrivalled in a game of this genre, which mantains a solid grip on realism and historical accuracy. In fact OOBs are historically accurate ( you will not see hordes of Tigers) and also gun penetration and vehicle damage mechanics are nicely modelled, without health bars which we see in too many games.Finally a HUGE plus of this game is the non-scripted AI. It's nice playing Combat Mission, but when you fall in that scripted ambush you will never fall for it again. Here nothing is apparently scripted: the AI can make good or stupid decisions, but will never make the same thing again over and over. This make the two campaigns (for each side) more replayable.Do not forget that there is also a battle editor, which allows for the creation of every battle you like using the campaign map.Compared to Operation Star there has been an improvement in the UI and several addictions, like better artillery support managament and tanks laying smoke for infantry to advance behind. Howewer, the sheer amount of content and campaigns of Operation Star with all the DLCs still make it worth buying imho.If i have to complain about something that would be the actual lack of multiplayer (which howewer seems to be added at some point, maybe as a free dlc. There is already a MP option in the menu but only as a placeholder). The learning curve is pretty steep like many games of this genre, and for a newb even with the tutorial it may be hard to get into the game.Also i hope they will make many DLCs like they did with GT:OS.For the techical part, as of now i haven't had a single crash. There are some minor bugs, like two infantry soldier stacking on each other, or the tank sinking in soft ground mechanics which need some work.The game is maybe a little less well optimized than his predecessor, with all things at maximum my GTX 670 can't always mantain 60fps, and in smoke cluster♥♥♥♥s fps can really drop. Still you can scale the graphics with many options.TL;DR version:+ best game of this scale+ two layers, operational and tactical+ nice graphics+ good approach (no need for excessive micromanaging)+ not scripted AI+ muh realism- multiplayer still to be added- steep learning curve for newbies of the genre"

76561198001015011,Recommended,312980,26605295,"Posted: 14 November, 2016",all,AlphaW0lph,"(Very) good games are pretty rare nowadays, especially for PC gamers. I have been looking a long time for a game that can hold my attention span for more than 10-20 hours. Few games could, like Fallout: New Vegas, Diablo 3, CoH2 and some others. Lately I’ve rather been collecting games instead of playing them like many others on Steam. Just playing them for a few hours and thinking “no, this is not it…” and ending up with 1.5 – 10 hours played and already getting bored. So which game could pull me in for more than at least 200 hours?When Graviteam Tactics: Mius Front came out I already played around 10 hours on Graviteam Tactics: Operation Star. The controls, the confusion about what’s going on, the lack of a good tutorial, it all added to putting the game down and thinking: “Nice game, but I’m gonna try a few others first”. But when GT:MF came out, I immediately bought it. I guess something in my unconscious, said: “Buy it. Just buy it! And give it another try!” It still took a few months, but after being disappointed by another bunch of games, I started GT:MF, and this time with the determination to not let go before I got the hang of it.And after another 15-20 hours, it struck me thinking: there is absolutely no equivalent to this game when you like RTS war games. GT:MF (and also GT:OS) will leave you speechless. If and only if you persevere the first few hours playing this game. And with “first few” I probably mean the first 100 hours and more. It is so much more than a RTS game, it is a real battlefield simulator. And a damn good one too! Don’t rely on the fact that when you issue orders, your soldiers will simply obey them. If your commander is too far away and you don’t have telephone and wire cables set up, your orders will not be transferred among other things.GT:MF is no click-fest like most other RTS games with intense micro management. No, it focuses on careful planning, creating strategies, coordinating combined forces of infantry, cavalry and anti-tank units, setting up defenses, entrenchments, fire archs, calling in air strikes or artillery, which shells to use, reinforcing units, line of sight etc, etc, etc. Everything is done during three phases: the strategic, the deployment and the operational phase.Replenished your units and carefully planned your defenses during the strategic and deployment phase? Well, you can bet the AI will try to circumvent you and attack from completely other directions you thought they would attack. When you thought they only had a few tanks, suddenly there are ten T34’s crushing your only three PAK’s you set up in the villages of Marinovka or Stepanovka. Key points can switch hands multiple times during the campaign.Because the campaign is long! Very long! I only played part of the Marinovka – Stepanovka campaign as Germans and I am still playing it. After reinforcing my units at strategic phase Turn 1, the Soviets attacked my positions from… Well, almost f****** everywhere!  All these battles you have to fight before you can replenish your troops and start Turn 2. I played for 20 hours now and I am still in Turn 2. No campaign will be the same, so the amount of replayability is huge!GT developers made it possible to transfer your units under AI command and I must admit, I do that a lot. But when the Russians come too close I take over command. But the AI is smart and you can sometimes sit back, relax and watch all hell break loose. Most of the time I use the “helicopter view” to direct my troops, but when you zoom in, the physics of the explosions and hits are so good. I always zoom in after the battle to see the statistics and devastation on the battlefield. You can watch the statistics to see which hit did most damage and which hit knocked out that tank or PAK or whatever. Which brings me to the level of detail.The game is so insanely detailed: everything is carefully crafted and added to the game: weapons, calibers, tanks, anti-tank, artillery, armour penetration diagrams (ridiculously detailed), ammunition, morale, command level etc, etc, etc. If you’re a World War 2 / history fanatic like me then this is definitely a (no, THE) game for you.Another thing to mention are the carefully crafted environments and staff maps. Heights play an important role and you better plan your strategies based on these on the information on these staff maps. It is all there on the maps: the gullies, hills, rivers, woods, farms, bridges. I immediately believe it if they say it is exactly the same as it was in 1943. The surroundings, the atmosphere, the tension during night battles with tracers flying everywhere. Man, this is a tactical wargame! Nothing comes close and all other wargames are redundant / unessential for me now. I am not saying other RTS war games are rubbish but no game can ever live up to the standards of this one for me.DLC will bring you new campaigns and I just bought Dawn of Blau as well as a few other expansions for GT:OS (some depict the Afghanistan campaign and one does the conflict in Angola bringing you new tanks and units). Do I need it right now? No, but the DLC for GT:OS is sometimes on sale like it was this weekend. Was the DLC for GT:MF also for sale? No, but these developers deserve my money for this one. This is the game I was looking for to sink more than 200 hours in. And I will!Most of the stuff I found out myself. But if you’re stuck or confused (and you will get stuck or get confused in the beginning) there are plenty of good tutorials on YouTube. I recommend the tutorials from Arch Warhammer or Agrippa Maxentius. They explain a lot and it’s worth to put some time into watching these videos as they make it a lot easier to get into the game. Be as tenacious as the Germans or the Soviets in this game and you will be rewarded with some very memorable moments. After twenty hours I can’t count them anymore as I won and lost various battles but each and everyone of these battles had it’s share of the finest moments in my overall gaming experience.I am still confused about some partsof the game: buttons, movements by the AI, artillery strikes off target although I planned it carefully, replenishment of troops and lots and lots of other things. But never ever has an RTS game with a slow pace given me so much excitement and joy. It keeps me on the edge of my seat and I found myself sometimes staring at the screen whispering: “Take out that bloody T34, for heavens sake!”Totally and highly recommended! I can not praise this game / these games and the developers enough! I already collected some medals during battles but if there was one with the Order of the Ukraine, it should be pinned on the chests of these wonderful men and / or women of this game studio. You deserve it!10/10 Masterpiece"

It requires a real commitment to learn how to play. There will be some frustrations intially. But if you are willing to persevere, check out some YouTube tutorials and wargaming forums, do some trial and error, you will be rewarded by what may well be the greatest serious/historical tactical-level World War II game ever made.The charges of the 'terrible' 'clunky' UI are overblown. Yes, the UI is *unique* -- it's unlike anything you've encountered elsewhere. It does take some getting used to. Yes, the documentation (manual) is lacking -- although the ingame tutorials are decent. But once you understand the UI, you will find it a flexible and powerful tool for managing the game and for crafting battlefield strategems that are surprisingly and satisfyingly multifaceted.I've seen some complaints about performance issues -- not sure what to say there, except that I've found Operation Star and now Mius Front both very stable (no crashes) and well optimized. I'm playing on a fairly robust rig (GTX 780 Ti, i7 3770K o/c to 4.6 GHz, 16 Gigs RAM) and the game is completely fluid on max graphics settings. And it is *gorgeous*. The modeling of terrain is amazing. And these are hands-down the most beautifully detailed vehicle models you  will find in a WW2 game.Cannot recommend highly enough. A masterpiece."

But that doesn't mean it's a easy game, it is a terrifically horrifically tremendously hard game. One does not simply win a battle in Graviteam Tactics: Mius-Front. Even if you do win, the cost will be high.Graviteam Tactics has improved a lot since Graviteam Tactics: Operation Star. Let's start with the graphics, they are very, if not tremendously satisfying, just looking at Infantry walking to the front lines makes you want to go with them and see what they are going to do. The graphics make screenshots look like 18th century war art (not in a bad way). It is just superb, well done Graviteam *claps*.Secondly the animations, they are wonderful, they are one of the most realistic movements, but they do become unrealistic when they either go through terrain or when they just switch to the other pose so rapidly that it just looks like a mess, but it is getting better.Thirdly the gameplay (I am missing out 'music' because there isn't much music in the game, though it is wonderful), the gameplay is a stockpile of fun, very good, wonderful even. I like when some of your men lay down covering fire and the rest charge, it just makes a epic cinematic (you do that with ctrl + back). In addition you can have allies/team mates (in the campaign as well). That's not all, you can make your own custom battles with the Battle Editor, just very well done Graviteam, GG.But something to note is that there is bugs and the AI is weak and easy to exploit (unless you are a new player). One time it had the overall advantage, outnumbering me and entrenched on a hill, but it surrendered.For this I rate it a 9.7/10 and if you like WW2 RTSs like CoH or MoW and your looking for a challenge I recommend it (for MoW veterans I highly recommend it)!If they make multiplayer and do a Liberation of France Expansion, would be the best game ever, even HL3 can't beat it.Some epic ingame screenshots which are by me (at the time of the review):http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=639254841http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=639209644http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=639492750EDIT: I forgot to mention that the community is really helpful, so if you have a problem just ask them."

So far with only 16 hours in I am still on the steep learning curve as to how to do things but, that said, with every hour played and with helpful tutorials, especially on You Tube, even those for the earlier Graviteam game  Operation Star, I am understanding more. With this understanding you realise just what depth and knowledge this game has to offer, There is a saying that the Devil is in the details and there is one huge Devil in this game. The Binocular and magnifying glass view of your tanks taking AT fire, of hits and brewing vehicles with molten steel sparking high into the air as ammo cooks off makes the game worth the price alone. The inclusion of German and Russian as the language being shouted by the soldiers adds to the historical depth that runs through the veins of the programming that has been lovingly coded into this creation.I could go on for many paragraphs about the attention to detail here but suffice to say, having a library of over 300 books just on the Eastern Front alone, Mius Front beats the oppositon in so many ways showing the War in that theatre of operations. Get over your concern about how to actually cope with all the menus and control options as they will make sense over time. I am still learning and will be for a few days if not weeks but who cares.

I tried out their T-72 demo when it came out well over a decade ago, and was disappointed by the amount of bugs.Last year, I tried their Steel Armor: Blaze of War game, and was frustrated by the strategical and tactical maps, clunky UI and lack of fidelity of the tanks they tried to simulate.But after trying a lot of strategy games, I was always disappointed by their lack of realism. Rock, paper, scissors may be fun, but history nerds look for something more realistic.After seeing Agrippa Maxentius' first look video of Graviteam Tactics: Mius Front, I was sold.- Beautifully made models- Amazing animations- Realistic ballistics and unit capabilitiesToo bad I can't show a gif of how the Tiger turret moves and the sound it makes, it's simply stunning.Same with how men escape their burning tanks, evade the tracer rounds of the enemy and crawl/run/crawl to safety.It's amazing and shocking all at once, I've never experienced anything quite like it.You can almost smell the cordite, and feel the pain of the troops.If you are a history buff: Buy it.If you like strategy games: Buy it.If you are looking for a battle simulator: Buy it.The best tactical game I've ever played.There, I've said it."

In my opinion this is how a sequel should be done.If you dont want to take the time to go through learning and are used to always winning agianst stupid A.I. this game may not be for you. It takes time! It will be frustrating and there is no formula for winning. There arent specific counters built into the game and artillery isnt always going to come down where you call it.

I've had the most fun when I've avoided infantry as much as possible, especially infantry managed heavy weapons which are literally the most obnoxious things in the game. The tank play is excellent and entertaining to watch, and the air stuff is always impressive even if I have no idea what drives that whole thing. Attacking is hugely fun, especially if you've got halftracks and assault infantry and tanks and artillery observers against an enemy in an entrenched position.Defending could not possibly suck more than it does.The issues with this franchise (speaking as someone who owns this and Operation Star and has played both) are numerous and severe.* Line of fire is impossible to assess without painstaking evaluation using a line tool. Which button engages that tool? Why, the checkerboard over a tank. And you thought that launched the tank checkers minigame! The button next to it which shows a line between a two objects (one of which is a tank)? That's not a line of fire tool silly, that's a totally unrelated vision sectors button which as far as I can tell does basically nothing. Welcome to insanityville.* There's also an area of sight tool, but this tool is actually irrelevant to figuring out where units can fire. And so, by the way, is the line of fire tool? Why? Well, line of fire judges ability to fire from the center of the squad, while the game actually checks firing capability at the individual weapon level. As far as the area of sight tool, I have no idea what it is intended to actually show. All I know is that areas will be red even as the line of fire tool indicates they are green for shooting. I'm guessing the game must be modeling broken glasses or severe intoxication on my soldiers because how else can you explain clear line of fire out to 500 yards and area of sight indicating poor visibility beyond 100 yards on a clear effing day?* Combining cover with the line of fire tool is a great way to drive yourselve absolutely barking mad.* Why does this stuff matter? Well, because your soldiers manning critical heavy weapons like machine guns and anti tank guns will abandon most of their ammunition if you ask them to move their weapon somewhere else so that they're able to shoot. This is because the game hates you and wants you to suffer. Enemy tanks charging forward and your tank can't hit them because of some wonky behavior from the game?* Another annoyance is that the game will indicate an attack is arriving from a particular direction, but the enemy (and player) can deploy and attack from a wholly different sector entirely. This makes a mockery of the defense unless you are that lucky jerk who managed to find the one giant hill in all of Russia and dump all your equipment on it.* The menu buttons are totally incomprehensible hieroglyphics with seriously important consequences. I've just come back to the game after a long, long break and clicked on one that immediately dropped me out of a battle to my desktop with zero warning. Apparently this is the ""haha i trol u"" button.I like this game. I tolerate the UI. I play it from time to time. I had an enormous amount of fun with the Soviets vs China Cold War scenarios, and with setting up quick battles between tank forces. Watching Tigers get shattered by T-55s is never not going to be entertaining . And I am always entirely disappointed. Not because the game itself is bad, but because the developers have clearly got so much potential in this franchise and have decided to squirrel it all away from potential adoring with a UI that was clearly made with the goal of causing players to tear out their hair in frustration, and a line of fire system that is equal parts arcane and infuriating.I just spent another ten bucks on a DLC that I probably won't ever finish because the frustration of infantry combat will turn me away from this game again. Please, please spend the money hiring people who can fix the atrocious UI and create a more comprehensible set of rules for line of fire. If the developers fixed these issues on this or a future title I'll be happy to personally shower them in money."
,Recommended,312980,31586937,Posted: 6 May,all,40s & Blunts,"The Graviteam games are a lot like the Combat Mission games except more intense, more ambitious and if Combat Mission actively wanted you to not know how to play it. Despite that, despite the comparison, there are no other games like the Graviteam games. This game is a SIMULATOR. Very little is abstracted. The issue is that very little is explained; one has to actively work to even get past implementing basic strategies or tactics. The game actually does a lot for you, but it's hard to know when and how that will happen, so you have to guess a lot and many of those guesses will be wrong. And that sounds like it could be a plus for the game, as chaos and uncertainty are necessary elements of emulating the WWII battlefield, right? Except that the uncertainty, the guesses you have to make while not knowing aren't the kind of estimations or hazard guesses that actual commanders would make with minimal info on the ground with their soldiers; instead the guesses the player makes are those of someone who doesn't know what interface iconography means, or what route one takes through the game's interface to order your men to do X or Y. It can be really obnoxious to learn and is inelegant design. The criticisms people have of these games are very valid.That said, the Graviteam games are still fantastic and impressive pieces of work, you just have to know what you're getting into and be okay with that. The games can require the patience of saint--sometimes you feel like a mother having to tend to an unruly, moody child. But if you're gentle with it and are willing to get♥♥♥♥♥♥on your sleaves, actually playing through a campaign can be very rewarding. The folks who made these games have developed a series of unprecendented scope and realism, evocative to the point where even the tedium of military operations bleeds through, and hair-pulling frustrations of trying to get filthy, exhausted individuals to claw through the dirt towards an objective butts right up against the epic feel of maneuvering entire companies of men and tanks across hundreds of miles of terrain. Dozens of tanks and vehicles, hundreds of human beings creeping across hills and valleys, bombed out villages and abanonded defensive positions. Nothing really compares to it. But it takes a long time and you have to be stubborn."

,Recommended,312980,21744655,"Posted: 10 March, 2016",all,Hofstadter,"I am a very avid wargamer and have played a decent amount of titles, and this game is possibly one of the best wargames out there for its scope. There are several layers to wargames, strategic, operational, tactical and this game falls under the category of the last two for how the game plays out in its two phases. The first is a layer which shows a large map consisting of a company sized force. Which is organized down to battalion, platoon and at the lowest level, squad.Those that bought this game right away are fans of the first Graviteam game Operation Star, which was a gem in its own right but had its problems which come naturally from a Ukranian/Russian game studio. The most obvious of which is a very confusing user interface. Although it did change from GTOS there is an increased amount of abstraction but gives a decent amount of info. The first game allowed you to detach units from the reserve groups and manually attach them to platoons with a spare space. This is changed in this game because now you do not have the option to attach these reserves on a specific nature. Instead you choose the type on reinforcement on the management screen, and then hope you got what you wanted. For instance in the first you could move an anti tank rifle squad into a platoon, nice and simple, but now you would select ""anti-tank"" and you may get that squad, or a gun. If you select support you may get a mortar or an arty spotter. This simulates the ""you get what you are given so stop complaining"" nature of warfare but sacrifices control of platoon compositionThe graphics are amazing, and are much improved from the last game. It looks great, so I'll leave it at that.Sound is a bit to be desired with slightly cut off and strange sounding guns and explosions, however these will be modded in the near future. Going down close to soldiers also lets you hear them laughing...really...damn...awkwardlyTactical battles are a work of art but leave a little to be desired in regards of unit control. This game simulates high level command so there is only so much you can control. All you can basically do is tell your units to move in a certain formation, face a direction and give target priorities. Although you can adjust the modifiers of how your units move in a neat radial menu. I would like to be able to adjust rate of fire, and grenade usage. However this will be forgotten in the heat of battle.As I said before, the UI sucks. Its horrible, its ugly, and its only a minor improvement from GTOS. The manual does not help with this..Lets conclude this haphazard review. This game is NOT for casual strategy fans, that comes out as elitist, but this game is designed for a very niche group of people called Grognards, these people play very abstracted games focused on wargames with a high level of complexity. This is reflected in the type of warfare that plays out which is primarily skirmisher warfare. Where units get into trenches, spot the enemy and fight a battle of attrition. You wont flank through gullys, charge a fortification or storm a building. You will be placing your units through forests and positioning at the edge for them to fire at the enemy. This is pure skirmisher warfare and it is not for those expecting a Company Of Heroes or Men of War Experience. Behind the bad UI is a beautiful gem of a wargame that can allow one to simulate high command on a operational and tactical level. Where you can give general orders to your units and hope they have the strength to carry them out. This game is for wargamers, and not for people looking for a quick campaign."

Maddening in the sense of not being able to spot♥♥♥♥♥♥until you have Russian infantry cuddling up to your frontline soldiers in their trenches, fanstastic that a Russian tank will roll right between two dug in positions with infantry hitching a ride on the back and not know it until a grenade catches it in the side and disables a track, getting it's hitchhikers caught in a bulletstorm.All in all, definitely a good purchase.

I have played Battlefront published games like the original Combat Mission series from 15 years ago or so. This game is somewhat comparible in style, however it is more or less a live action game after the pieces are set. This is not a RTS type of game like Company of Heroes, it's really a battlefield simulator with a God's eye view of everything and the ability to pause and speed up.Unfortunately, the developer sort of dumps you straight into a main menu with a couple of large scenarios right off the bat. If you're inexperienced, don't try to play these, use the quick battle option and you will find several tutorial type of scenarios to run. These are extremely sensitive to deviation from the instructions. If you misunderstand an instruction or click the wrong button, you will probably have to start it over again to complete it. Fortunatly, these scenarios are small enough to avoid overwhelming a new player.The game interface is quite difficult to understand and the overall presentation is not well thought out. However it is configuable and if you're willing to spend some time watching experienced players play this game on Youtube, it is not an insurmountable task to get to a point where you find it playable.The sound quality is fair, but not great, I get a bit of popping and crackling with button clicks and other actions that is annoying with headphones on. The music is awful and I had to turn it off within minutes of playing my first scenario. The graphics would have been cutting edge 10 years ago; today they are passable.The game play is actually quite fun. There is a setup phase, then a battle phase. The setup of your forces is a bit simplified, however there is a decent amount of complexity and you can do an adequate level of fine tuning of positions. The line of site tool is extremely valuable, especially during the deployment phase.Once the battle begins, your task is mainly scanning your God's eye around the battlefield and prioritizing targets or adjusting force maneuvers/positions. You never control anything directly, you can issues orders. There is a great deal of complexity and some battles are so large, that micromanagement would make the game too tedious.If you're looking for a good WWII battlefield simulation with lots of complexity and accuracy to details, you will like this.

The units are more responsive to orders. There are several proper tutorials to learn the basics of the game unlike in Operation Star.However there is still a problem with the gameplay. Its not very clear how to assess the line of sight of your units, what for you is a good firing position its actually a bad position for the unit, this means that you need to check the line of sight of your units one by one. Even in easy mode the game is difficult for no clear reason, some magical bullet will kill your commander, enemy infantry will charge your tanks without problems but your infantry with tank support charging a weak enemy position will enter in panic.  For some reason the tanks cannot fire steadily in what should be a clean shot.

Its not your normal RTS every move has a negative and positive outcome, Artillary is terrifying or your best freind same goes with trenches. There is nothing better than having thinking you have set up a great defensive strategy only to find out 20 minutes in you didnt take into account one of your flanks is weak and their infantry sneak up to your pak guns and destroys 2 of your 3 and then you have to scramble to attempt to secure the flank with a unit that has low ammo and taken heavy losses and all other units are heavily engaged. Every loss and victory have atleast 2 memorable moments in that conflict and I say atleast 2 because every burning hulk of metal or fallen soldiers has a story that cannot be recreated in any other game just look at all the screenshots. After the battle you can look at the battlefield and see the carnage that I have never seen in any other game that can depict a battle that was never scripted. No campaign will play the same. I really dont have to many negatives besides sometimes the AI can act kind of funny but overall it does a very good job.

Prices are always reasonable, but sale prices outright undervalue the game.As with all Graviteam titles, Mius is not a game you can just pick up and play.  You have to learn the interface and commands, in addition to the funcitionality of all the weapons systems in the game.  You have to understand the effects of terrain, down to whether your heavy weapons can move through a muddy field.  You have to understand the effects of weather, such as how to deal with wind or storms.Beware that you will only find Mius' greatest rewards after extensive efforts to understand details of the battlefield."

At least for someone like myself with many years of real life military training and experience and that's one of the first games that's actually managed to just seamlessly blend a game with the feel of a professional military wargame.The feel and flow of the game is purely outstanding. It does just about everything right compared to the competition and the realism and flow of combat is so nicely done real life battalion tactics simply work out of the box, without requiring a second thought on game-mechanics.If you enjoy titles like Combat Mission, Close Combat etc this is a must have. If you like titles like Company of Heroes but  want more realism and want to get an idea of the challenges of realistic large-scale combat then this is also something I recommend."

The tutorials are a must for new players. they do a satisfactory job of explaining the UI and the game itself. The gameplay is truly something unique. and does a fine job of balancing operational and tactical modes. I was impressed to see the devs promptly roll out updates addressing bugs and decided to buy the game.I noticed that if you issue a group order to attack, the entire group will wait for everyone to get in line before advancing. This is all fine and dandy, except sometimes one unit will get itself stuck in a ditch, and stubbornly refuse to unf*ck itself. I guess manually having to reverse a vehicle out of the ditch and telling the dumbass driver to go around via waypoints is part of the realism experience.On a serious note, persevere past the learning curve and you will find a hidden gem of a game.

I only revently bought the game, despite the hours pumped into holding the German front. Enjoy slowing learning the outlay of the land and the capabilities of your forces while the Russians pump infantry, tanks, and artillery down your throat while slowly being pushed back in sectors and defiently holding out against overwhelming forces. If you are looking for a game that is both frustrating and enthralling, Mius Front is your pick. The essence of World War Two as I zoom in on my troops losing commanders and becoming shell shocked is only the beginning of engulfing yourself into the emmense outlay of the terrain and the wooden buildings that hardly provide cover for your troops and are more useful as fire tender.

AI fails to act as normal soldiers in the battlefield condition, you are going to see lots of instances where you will pull at your hair.For example, when given an attack command with the infantry machine gun section advances alongside them and upon acquiring the enem targets waits for about a minutes before deciding to open fire. This fire goes on for 15-20 seconds. After that it refuses to fire for another minute doing absolutely nothing and looking at the enemy while getting shot at.I had high hopes after operation star and the advance of technology after that but only things that improved were graphics.At its current state i dont recommend it, and i highly doubt AI is something that can be fixed with patches."

They do really bring to life the time and place these battles actually happened. Not to mention the tanks... beautifully modelled and animated.On the other hand, the completely unrealistic force sizes in battles (like what is supposedly a division-level assault being led by like three platoons simultaneously over a frontage of 3 kilometers) and weirdness in the UI and the mechanics drove me away. I bought the games because I like the setting, I like that there's people out there crafting games about this period and I appreciate jumping into these battlefields, but not because I enjoyed maneuvering platoons on a battlespace big enough to accomodate a battalion or two.But something has changed, and oh boy, defnitely for the better.Since the release of the British module for their Tunisia game Graviteam has introduced the concept of ""battlegroup"" at the operational layer... which means that now you can command a battalion (plus supporting armour and artillery) in a battle. Graviteam's efforts at improving the AI and UI now pay off - these very sophisticated formations and SOPs now fit into the context of maneuvering realistically sized, combined arms forces...These Ukranian geniuses have brought about the Holy Grail of tactical wargaming. Namely, a game that achieves at the same time, all of the following: a meaningful operational layer like that of Close Combat the Longest Hour, intellectually challenging tactical engagements with realistic orders of battle and, most importantly, plenty of support (by having an AI that can actually can be delegated the minutiae of maneuvering and organising attacks by fire and movement) to manage all these formations so the game is playable and you receive information in a manageable volume and timely fashion.Right now only two operations (for the Shilovo DLC) have been converted to the Battlegroup system, and I look forward to see progressively the other operations converted too. Play through these, and you will get to experience the most realistic portrayal of World War 2 fighting I have seen on a computer war game. Enjoy!"

This game is pretty impenetrable, and the tutorial is either broken or just infinitely too advanced for me.I assumed clicking ""campaign"" would be where you start. No, apparently ""basic training"" is in ""quick battle."" That makes sense, right? If your UI has more than 30 buttons and symbols, please accept the need for a tutorial to jump out at people.So I start the tutorial. Move your camera, raise/lower it, turn it. All good. Now what? No 4th message appears. I see I have a unit, so I start messing around with it and looking at the buttons (which are all delayed tooltips). A couple of minutes into this, it finally pops up ""move it here."" After another 3 minutes of waiting, halfway into which I find the option to make time go faster (you right click the pause button, I think), my tank arrives. Next it shows other movement types and waypoints. As that's moving, it shows some other stuff, like the ""halt order"" button. Well, I try to click it. That's common to do in a tutorial, right? Use every function as it's shown to you? I mean, I want to find out of the halt is a full cancel, if it just pauses the action and you can unpause it, or what? Well, I can't tell you anything else. After that, any attempt to order a move again was met with ""order not executed"" in the top right. Can you select ""order not executed"" to be told why? Nope. Who'd need that in a tutorial?All of this is that much more upsetting because it looks like a fun game - a /complicated/ fun game. But I had a much easier time getting into an ASCII roguelike. So it's a 22 minute refund - the first time I've used the function on steam.It looks like a really good game, possibly the best thing available for what it is. But I don't want that specific thing that badly to spend many hours digging through the internet to learn how to play this game.
