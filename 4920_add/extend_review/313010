It was a bad idea, because you can see how identical the games are. The best part is they forgot to rename the program so it's still labelled as Cities XL if you play in windowed mode. It just shows the extreme laziness and lack of care from the developper. Where is the refund button?"

But, this game is the exact same game as what came before.  The exact same buildings, the exact same tools, the exact same interface layout.  The only differences I have been able to spot are the new color of the interface (from blue to black) and apparently it has multi-thread support.I could have just saved the 20 dollars and played Cities XL, and gotten the exact same experience.  It is a bit sad that they repackaged an old game and sold it for so much while promising us ""tons of new features"".  Maybe a ton has a different weight value wherever this developer is located.Edit: Due to some legit points made in the comments section of this review I've decided to make an edit.Old players: Don't buy it, unless you play it every day, then you'll have bought it anyway.New Players:  I would characterize this game as more of a City Editor instead of more of a city sim in the manner of the old SimCitys.  In my opinion, this game is just too easy to plop whatever you want down, and watch it build itself.  Yes, you can build a massive city in many of the ways you want.  But if you want to start with a small town, and work your♥♥♥♥♥off to turn it into a bustling metropolis after hours and hours of fun gameplay, and then have to deal with sprawl, aging infrastructure, and urban blight....then this is not the game for you.To that end, I would characterize this game as a pretty boring way to spend an evening as you just point and plop whatever you want or need and then watch the grey boxes go around your city because you don't want to view your city one street at a time."

But lets first look at what's sold:""Running on an improved game engine for enhanced performances, Cities XXL offers classic and extended city-building content, including over 1000 buildings and structures, over 65 maps including new landscapes and environments, and ecological features making Cities XXL the 'greenest' Cities XL game yet.""and""Design, build, and manage the world’s largest and most diverse cities in Cities XXL. Bigger and better than ever before with a more powerful game engine and new interface, become the mayor of your very own sprawling metropolis.""So they didn't say ""new"" landsapces, ""new"" structures.  Ok, I get that.  I didn't really expect it to be a massive difference from the XL version in that sense.I bought the game thinking there would bean improved game engine for enhanced performance.  That's what was sold - an improved game engine.  The previous version really suffered from terrible performance.  Has the performance been improved in this one?  Nope.  Not a bit.I really don't know what this version offers over the previous one.Focus deserves the bad publicity.  You know how you ruin a brand?  This is how."

IF you're coming in new to this series, or have a very old version of this game, this is by far the best version of this game and could be worth the price, but then again you could get an older version for a lot less and get basically the exact same game - except it runs much worse. The bad reviews have to do with the complete lack of any new content, controls, UI, anything - it looks and controls exactly like previous versions of the game, there is no increase in quaility, the controls still mostly stink - but it does run much better now.-------So I've liked the older Cities games, enough that I pre-ordered this one. I boot it up and tah dah... well there is no need to relearn anything since its 99% of the exact same game.So to recap the ""NEW"" version:Positives:- This is overlooked in the other reviews I've seen but the game does run much smoother than in the past. I wouldn't really say it looks better, but its no longer sluggish on my top of the line gaming PC. Older versions of the game ran pretty awful, even on top of the line hardware.Negitives:- It's the same exact game as before.- The controls still stink. If they had just upgraded the graphical engine so it ran much bettter (which they did) AND updated the controls so it worked more like SimCity, this game would have been worth the $20 to me. However they did not do that, it controls just as terrible as the previous versions of the game.- It's the same game... which means it will probably be on sale on Steam for $5 in a week.Overall this is very very disappointing. Hopefully with the workshop intergration fans will be able to do the job the devs decided not to do - and that is to give us a new game.If you're new to this game just wait a couple of weeks, it will surely be on sale as they try to get people to buy this desipte all the poor reviews. This is the best version of this game since it runs better, but otherwise, again, it's the same exact game as the versions you can buy all day and night for $5 or less."

,Not Recommended,313010,14581466,"Posted: 21 February, 2015",all,Sanzi,"This game is basically Cities XL with a few minor changes. They changed the color scheme to this black modern looking theme and added in workshop support and trading cards. The features on how to monitor and build your city are the EXACT SAME! They even had the nerve to use the same exact maps! There are probably a few more new buildings in Cities XXL but not worth buying another game just for that. Also on the old Cities XL when my city got around a population of 300k I was pretty much done because the lag made doing anything impossible. They kind of fixed it, I was able to reach about 600k population until the lag did start getting unbearable.So basically all they did was make a new color scheme, sort of fix the lag problem, and add minimal buildings. I would not reccomend buying this game no matter what, even if you do or don't own Cities XL or one of their prior games. Focus Home Interactive should be ashamed for ripping all of us. Well guess what, now you guys have a crapy reputation due to your stupid plan. Stay away from this game, and anything with Focus Home Interactive on it for that matter."

Cities X-whateverhas essentially not changed very much since the original and I think that is quite apparent.They say that the game engine is better; It still runs kind of choppy and has the same problems.They say that the maps are larger; As far as I'm aware, they are the exact size that they've always been.They say that the interface is new; The buttons are grey and make less annoying sounds when you click on them.But hey, at least the music is all new.I don'thatethe game. I'm not going to beg for my $20 back. I will play this game as there are elements that I like about it. It may not be the prettiest or the best city-sim out there, but then again, there aren't many good city-builders out there.If I were you, I would not buyCities XXLif you already own a previous Cities title. If you do not own a Cities title, and wish to get one, then I suppose consider this one or a previous one. But if you want a better city-sim, go grabSimCity4.SimCity3000is good, too. I would suggest the newSimCitybut I feel like I'm the only human who thought that game was okay."
,Not Recommended,313010,14341495,"Posted: 5 February, 2015",all,[GT]KrazyJay,"First impression:Compared to the previous editions, quite some things have changed. For example, the blue rounded buttons have been replaced by dark grey squares with straight corners. Since these buttons are really small on my 1440p-screen (not to brag), I wonder where the extra X in its title comes from, but it certainly does not refer to these buttons. The sounds during interaction have not changed, the resources are the same, and trading works the same as it always has done. Omnicorp is awaiting your trades when you have no friends (or actually, other cities, as I have not found the online multiplayer yet which actually kind of made one of the previous editions of this game). But, I have to admit, when you start the game you get a nice but short animation carrying the word ""Focus"". Whatever Focus may be, a studio, a gang of angry Italian hamsters that took this game and tried to earn an extra buck by adding an ""X"", I dearly hope they have actually fixed the memory leak bug from previous editions. Then it may actually be worth 5 units of your national currency when it is on sale in a month or 2. Until then, just Focus. On games that may actually be worth it. Or that hamster gang. Who knows..."

However, there is no changes from XL to XXL except for the color of the menu, the tutorial was taken word by word from Cites XLSo if you don't have XL go ahead and buy XXL, but if you had XL and consider buying XXL don't waste your money."
,Not Recommended,313010,14341593,"Posted: 5 February, 2015",all,Xanos,"First the most important: this game cannot really be considered as a ""game"", it is more of a paid patch to older Cities XL versions with many of the bugs STILL present. No surprise, that owners of older versions of Cities XL get a discount - In fact they are just buying the same game again (as I did -_- ).If you already own one of the previous Cities XL titles, please don't make the same mistake I did: please do not buy this ""game"". The game is 99% identical to older ones, only the interface is now black instead of blue and the performance is slightly better. Normally, one should expect this type of change in an update instead of a new release.If you are interested in how this game works and what it offers, I propose you may watch some gameplay videos on youtube, as they might tell you more than I could describe in a text here on Steam. However, I'll try with just a few words:You start with one of different pre-defined maps, lay out roads, build a town hall and then start zoning residential, industrial and commercial areas. The game offers quite a few nice ideas: residential zoning is separated into different ""wealth"" categories. The different types of residents are required to operate different types of industry, offices or other workplaces. There are also different density options with higher density offering larger and higher buildings. The ""trading"" inside the city is calculated using ""tokens"". Heavy industry needs tokens of unskilled workers and generated heavy industry while manufacturing industry may convert this into manufactured goods which may then be used in commercial areas. If a city is in need of tokens of a certain type, or may have a surplus, tokens may be traded with other cities. However, this trading system is heavily bugged since the first version of Cities XL and was not fixed until today. Of course there is also power, water, pollution, leisure, police, healthcare, fire, etc... However, the simulation is only based on statistics, there is no ""real"" simulation of vehicles, inhabitants or anything like this.If you look for an alternative in the City-Building genre Cities (X)XL might be the right game for you if you can withstand bugs. However, you might want to take a look at one of the (almost) identical older versions of Cities XL for a cheaper price ;)And again: please think twice before buying this ""update"" if you own a previous game of the franchise."

,Not Recommended,313010,18571243,"Posted: 19 October, 2015",all,MegaBearsFan,"So right off the bat, Cities XXL is not substantially different from its predecessor (Cities XL). In my time with the game so far, I've only encountered two new features. Everything else, right down to the buildings available and the game interface, are unchanged. XXL hardly deserves to be called a sequel or sold as a new game. It's a content patch, and not even a very good one.When I first started playing Cities XL a few years ago, I was really impressed with it. I hadn't really played any modern city-builder games since SimCity 4, and so the jump to 3-D graphics, the ability to draw curved roads, and the sheer size of the maps was enough to win me over initially. But as I've played the game more, it's limitations and weaknesses have become much more apparent and hard to ignore. This is especially true in the game's interface and controls, which are very rough and full of nagging annoyances. When compared to the much smoother and organic controls of games like Tropico 5, the modern [disastrous] SimCity reboot, and even older games like Caesar IV, Cities XL really starts to look bad.The biggest deterrent to enjoying Cities XL is its UI and controls. There's nothing that really single-handedly breaks the game, but there's a cacaphony of small, nagging problems that gradually wear down your resolve to play the game. The first thing that you'll notice is the ugly and disorganized interface. There are buttons and widgets floating all over the screen: build icons, overlay toggles, camera control widgets, zoning sub-controls, and so on. You can customize some of the UI elements by dragging them to different places on the screen, but there is no arrangement that really feels comfortable.Read full review on my blog:http://www.megabearsfan.net/post/2015/04/28/Cities-XXL-game-review.aspx"

And they did. *** it up completely.* First the rendering engine has gone haywire, torturing my video card for 120+ FPS on region selection screen, the fan went crazy. And there's no vsync option so I can't help it :( In-game it's flickering terribly, random roads and buildings disappearing on zooming out.* New UI... Okay, maybe old one did need some facelift, but it wasn't that bad to replace it with this buggy hell. Some buttons require some searching for a spot that would register the click. Hell, it looks like exactly same UI that was in previous games, only repainted black, added transparency, and rounded buttons replaced with plain rectangles.I can't say much about other features, as I can't really play it because of the flickering and tearing (come on, give us vsync!), it hurts my eyes. But based on the promises of added features it isn't that much different from 2013 Platinum.Right now it needs some patching up to become playable. If that happens (which we don't know, FHI never communicate) it might be recommendable to people who haven't played any Cities XL games.But right now you'd be better off with Cities XL 2013.

Yes, it does look graphicaly better, somewhat, and the Multi-core support is showen. But just barely. When theres zones being built, I see massive frame drops and the game starts to lag quite a bit. Which is surprising because it was suppose to be such a smooth game to play. The UI is the same, with only the play/fast-forward buttons moved, and the color of the UI is now a dark grey instead of blue.Persionally, this game should be running way better on my system, seeing as how I have a high end gaming PC, (system specs below), but it barely maintains 60 FPS on a 4K screen. Which makes no sence since BF4 and BF:Hardline, both way more demanding games, especially on 4K, runs better with a comfortable 74 average FPS on my 4K monitor.Yes, the game does look slightly better, I will agree with that, and the map sizes are nicer too compared to SimCity, which I have played a lot of. But, SimCity does run better and looks way nicer with a better user interface then what Cities XXL has now. Yes SimCity 2013 did have an absolute horrendus launch, but after all of the patches and bug fixes that they have released, I'd much rather spend my time on SimCity then on Cities XXL.If you have not played Cities XL 2012, or Cities XL Platinum, then you should still get the game. But if you already have one of those two, and dont mind the UI, and lower frames, then I do not recomend this for you unless you have a pile of money burning a hole in you're pocket.Let's just hope that Cities: Skylines will be better. From the game play that I have seen on youtube about Cities: Skylines, it seems to have a much better user interface and it seems to run better over all.

The first iteration in 2009 felt like it was made with a lot of love. It had with its release the promise for a bright future. Since the demise of the original developer, Focus has had the tendency to ride it like a cash cow. It has neglected the franchise like an abusive parent witholding affection from its secretly adopted middle child.CitiesXXL is the latest annual crayon drawing posted on the refrigerator from the intern at Focus. Its release was preceded by an intentionally anemic campaign consisting of decent stills and an admittedly well-done video of the city they made for their marketing coordinator. Thinking about it now, it probably took that intern longer to build that city than the entire update to the poor shattered dreams of Monte Cristo's original code.It's been made clear why the publisher was so quiet leading up to its release as the expressed promise of a new game would have been somewhat misleading. CitiesXXL is sort of a new game.....but it's more of an update.I wouldn't call it a patch because that would imply a fix. My experience so far has been that it runs a bit slower than XL Platinum. It uses the same maps, and the same textures on some buildings which clearly spell ""CitiesXL"". Ironically, this seems to be the only thing spelled correctly. The updated metro-esque menus are poorly QC'd and have flagrant visual bugs on the surface. It feels like I'm beta testing.While I would love to be completely on one side of the black and white vitriol I find in the forums, I find myself kind of liking this update. The flaws haven't so far been game-breaking, and I really like the Steam integration. Mods are now incredibly simple to install and they have improved my experience. There is greater control of the camera, an updated soundtrack, and an Expert mode which is a wonderful addition.  I still don't like the classism that plagues the heart of the series, but I understand how it works and Expert mode helps dull that edge quite a bit.Attention to some of these details but not others has left me confused. Why are the controls so strange? I know it's European, but I would love to use WASD instead of arrow keys and edge tripping. Why can't I edit these controls? Why can't I edit mouse sensitivity? I should be able to upgrade roads in place-- especially when I meticulously curved that one to fit that ridge. Ugh.This isn't a bad game. Yes, it is an obvious cash-grab that should have been an update or DLC. Yes, Focus is deceitful and disgraceful. It is, however, an update to a pretty fun game. Casual CitiesXL Platinum gamers will be disappointed. This would likely be worth the purchase for avid players and new players who just can't wait for Cities:Skylines."

So the save menu and load menu are the same which is confusing, and there is no overwrite function really, without having to make two new saves and typing in the exact same name for each. i had hours of work erased. and even though the game autosaves, when i accidentally restarted the game it erased those. like, whats the point of having an automatic save system if it just erases it when you make a mistake. just bad system design and for that i have to give this game a thumbs down."

Well don't get me wrong, challange is a good thing but I never felt much chalanged by cities xl as I felt ""Chalanged"".But only if I look at the game without looking at the competition. I find simcity 5 still to be a much better game in many aspects of the gameplay. But finaly simcity 4 is a way better game. Even SiomCity 3000 is because of it's charme and it's mechanics a much better game. I wouldn't say it is worse than simcity 2000 or simcity classic but since those are about 20 to 30 years older than this game, this doesn't mean allot.The best improvment over cities XL is the music.I say I will play it more than cities xl and will get arrant for my money but no sir, it is a rip off.Also I didn't spell check because I don't belief the game is neither good or bad enough to be worth the time. I think that tells allot.Edit: Well the Music Tracks are awesome except ""Synthesized Troughs"", why is that so? Because it sounds like the put in the sound of a toilet flush with 22kbps sampling rate, severall times. How can you ruin your own music whith something that awefull that leaves a disgusting aftertaste. The good news is that you can just put that file out of the audio folder and steam doesn't try to replace itr, you can even put your own music there.Bad thing is that for a game like this all the tracks are to short even they could be much longer. You can listen to the same music far longer but the titels are betwen 2-3 minuts while SimCity 4 for example 4-7minuts and even there I found the tracks to short for a game like this but at least there where about 20 not only like 7, but thank foxy than they don't sound all similar like in SimCity 5.Oh and Btw. thje Multi Thrad Support works, but it needs a very while until it works. The game will start using one Core, at least if you minimized the window and maximized it after that. But after a while it will even use all 8 cores of an AMD FX8120. Sadly the Improvement seems subtle."

Though i have seen performance improvement in the game, i have a task manager that shows cpu usage is like %50 and it was like %25 in the cities xl. But this does not satisfy the people who already own cities xl.But here is why i recommend this game for newcomers. If you have played city life 2008, this game is so similar to that one. If you have played sim city 4, this game is easier and has a little bit different concept and understanding.If you are totaly new to city building, i would chose this one over cities skylines. This is not a hard game because there are easy and resourceful maps. There are pain in the♥♥♥♥♥maps too. Cities are groving quickly but you still have to be careful while groving and keep the city in balance. There are nice arcitechtural options like curved roads or filling up ares with plazas or parks. You do not have to build square like cities so you can create an esthetic city. Building on mountains are easy and roads have option to be elevated. You can go down to street level like google street view :D Visuals are amazing. There is a photo mode. Soundtrack is cute, i love listening them. There are bridges and tunnels as well as trains and highways. There is a summarized information about cities needs and surpluses.

BUT SEVERELY LACKING THE 'NEW'As soon as I heard that a fresh new Cities XL game was on the horizon, I had really big hopes that this would finally be a new start for the series, a proper major upgrade from Cities XL that maintained the best bits of the series whilst introducing significant improvements in gameplay, customisation and capabilities. This is a game that had to be MORE that Cities XL was and, given the title's new X, one would assume this to be the case. But, alas, two hours in and I find myself disappointed.Like with previous annual 'new releases' it feels that Focus have merely taken the same old game, given it 2015's lick of paint and sent it on its merry way. Underneath it all, this game feels exactly the same as the previous three incarnations and offers very little in the way of new. Don't get me wrong, it's not a 'bad' game. As city-builders go, Cities XL (or XXL) is a very different take compared to others in the genre, and where it excels in some areas of micro-management, it's lacking in others. But ultimately, if you are looking for an evolution from the previous versions of the game, XXL just does not cut it.Focus are crying ""wolf"" with this latest offering, and had I known Cities XXL would be an almost identical carbon copy of Cities XL, I would have stuck with the Platinum version and invested the money in alternative new takes on the city-building genre, such as 'Cities: Skylines'. Whilst Focus' rivals, Maxis, may have their critics and problems with their latest SimCity offering, they've atleast made the effort to evolve the series, even if it is with varying degrees of success. And while the latest SimCity has been an education for Maxis, Focus have yet to demonstrate that evolution is in their nature."

Did I really just get suckered out of $20 for a patch? WTF? It turns out I’m not alone, this developer has either taken us to be fools or has suffered some form of traumatic head trauma. So BUYER BEWARE this is a classic used car salesman stich, you know ""Used car for sale, belonged to a sweet older lady, only driven to church on Sundays…blah..blah,blah…suckers"" this developer should be ashamed.From title:""Bigger and better than ever before with a more powerful game engine and new interface, become the mayor of your very own sprawling metropolis.""Translation:So we slightly made a few tweaks here and there that we feel are ground breaking. BTW you know Steve in development? Yea it’s sad, his house caught on fire and burnt to the ground the other day. Then his wife ran off with one of the firemen. And if that wasn’t enough his car wouldn’t start this morning, he tried to push start it… ended up rolling the car over his sleeping dog. Poor little guy never saw it coming.  Soo needless to say, umm, yea he kinda, sorta, um well… he didn’t make to the release with the game content, so we released a repackaged version of the last game, our bad (it was totally for your enjoyment). Oh we also changed a few colors and added a useless interface here and there.To the developer: Gee thanks guy, I’m really glad I could pay you $20.00 for the same game I bought years ago. You really should hold onto your marketing team though, they managed to polish the hell out of this turd.I have 2 favors to ask of you:1.	Get the game data from Steve (tell him were sorry for his loss) and give us the “New” game we all paid for.2.	Since I doubt the above will happen, in the next Cities game please include an empty jar of Vaseline in the games title menu. This way we will know were about to be royally f@#ked.Steam,I know this may not be a burning priority and probably wont set off any warning bells (it should), but in the best interest of your customers I feel that this developers actions warrant a major review. I mean come on, I could see this being delivered in its current state as a work in progress had It been billed as an alpha/beta. But taking a several year old game and polishing it ever so slightly does not make it a new game. We (your customers) were taken for yet another ride. Something has to give, at some point someone there needs to stand up, grow a pair and say this isn’t right. Not every game is going to be a winner, it’s to be expected.

The same bugs, the same graphics, the same annoying errors that stopped me from playing previous editions.If you are new to this series, here are some facts:During first hour you will enjoy what seems like a vast array of buildings, options, possibilities.Soon you will realise that the fact that you can't control tilt of the camera is fricking annoying.You can't map any keyboard shortcuts neither so forget about wsad camera movement.Buildings are pretty but most of the non gridded ones will not connect to roads in a nice way so theystick out like frick.Roads are really not flexible. Apparently you can bend them which looks like all hell broke loose on antyaliasing. They constantly have problems connecting one to another if you try to do anything else than 90 degrees. You can upgrade them on a random occasion but you can't preview your choice (not even statistics so you don't know what benefits you will get) and often choice is totally usless. Also, if you decide you want to delete a road in an area with many gridded buildings, and replace it with a bigger one, often preexisting connections won't won't work forcing you to reverse the whole process or deleting a line of buildings which you will have to do one by one or with a radial tool.Seeing how roads are exteremely important in this game, the fact that they often don't work is quite a biggy for me.Roundabouts are totally useless. Won't connect to some roads and cars dissapear on them.Talking about cars, I don't know if animated vehicles reflect traffic but I do hope the don't as they drive like a bunch of total morons. Turning left? Sure, I will use the most right lane and stop all other cars. All. The. Time.The vast selection of buildings I mentioned before? Not really. Most of them you will find in a section called ""pack"". They are categorised badly, according to continents and have quite a few nice objects there, but it's difficult to find what you are looking and often they won't stick to your roads.In default categories you will often face a selection of a single model of a particular building making you create basketball courts all over your city as there is almost no leisure objects and the most efficient ones are sea based and costs sums of money that must have been set by jamming a zero on a keyboard.There is no multiplayer so whenever you have stuff to trade with, you often do it with a corporation that will give you a 1 to 1 exchange rate making it feel soooo realistic. For example, you can exchange 1 unit of unskilled workers for 1 unit of oil.You can't overwrite buildings meaning that you have to delete them before you can build something on top. Doesn't sound like a big issue but it starts to get supper annoying when you have a big city and need to increase any of public services or add stuff where other stuff already exists.Nottifications don't lead you anywhere. Unskilled workers need more leisure? Ok no problem. Which areas? F*** you. Find out on your own. Heavy traffic is making some roads unusable? Ok let's upgrade them. If only I knew which ones you mean. Yes, you do have some overlays to chose from (btw. icons here didn't change since I can remember) but still, would be so much quicker and easier if that little help was available. Who cares though, right?All in all, I'm really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that I spent £15 pounds on a game that I preety much already have.

,Recommended,313010,14346359,"Posted: 5 February, 2015",all,Swoy,"New info added! seeNEW:tags below.IntroductionWell, to start with, I have played all CXL there is, from the very first one to this - very last one. And I will have to say that this is however worth the money for once. I am actually impressed by the small things I have been annoyed by in earlier iterations of this franchise. Let me sumarize briefly what elements they've improved, and what is not changed about the game.ImprovementsThis is my list of things I have considered annoying for the past few games, and the status of their current state.AnnoyanceDescriptionStateCommentRoadsnappingOdd or erronous roadsnapping makes laying roads difficult and is sometimes a tedious jobFixedFrom my perspective this is fixed. I have tried to place roads on top of roads, build tunnels under districts and placed bridges in places not possible in previous iterations. It feels more natural now, which is good enough for me.Traffic jamWhen building a block or a few streets, and want to allow the citizens commute to work, you end up with traffic jams all over the place and those ""real life""- scenarios wont work as expected. Forcing expressways where a normal avenue should have sufficed.Fixed and FixedAt least, it seems better now, after making a few neighbourhoods as i normally would do, the difference is clear from CXL and CXXL, the traffic flow is just that much better, and I can focus on infrastructure the way it should have been from the start.PollutionIndustry and car pollution either grow to fast or is totally out of proportions from the start.FixedThis is where I actually became the most surprised! Things work so much better now, they've tweaked the industry so that the polution is less problematic where you expect it. And if you place coal-plants, they polute exactly how I expect them to.MenusThe menus lack certain areas, such as achievements - and they are extremely laggy and can sometimes crash you game if not used in certain ways.FixedNew shiny black UI, they've added a filter for housing - possibly to cater for the many mods which you can find in the workshop!! Good workshop integration as well.Multicore support and memory leaksGame goes haywire if you have a 300K+ city, this is due to several memory-leaks and 1 core utillization. The game runs as well on a pentium single core 4Ghz as it does on a 5970X.FIXEDCurrently I'm pushing 4 cores active on CXXL, memory usage is a steady 2.2GB and I must say the game is snappy as it can be so far!New content from developersVery little content is published by the developer and there is not much new stuff in terms of new housing, maps and blueprints. The variety of games features is heavily dependant on the work in our communityNot fixedHowever, they've implemented workshop -  which translates to a better way of adding mods to your game. Would have liked to see some more content anyway.Running issuesWhile they've improved plenty, there are also many issues here. Some are even newly introduced and others are adopted from back in the previous versions.Long roads are laggyIf you place long stretches of roads, it becomes laggy when you lay new roads intersecting these roads. It stutters a lot but is not unplayable. They should fix this very soon.BroadcastingBroadcasting can introduce some lagg as well, Especially when you try to zone large districts.Many cities slow tradingIf you a large amount of cities, it can have a slight effect on the trade menu.Savegames disapear/crash the gameI have already experienced savegame corruption and crashes from loading saves. To avoid this, do not use workshop yet. And do not download the community pack yet. There are issues which have deleted my savegames  (or they just disapeard from the load menu). And when I load pre-workshopped saves the game just crashes. This is a must solve as soon as possible..NEW:Instabillities while playingIf experienced more instabillities, the game is very laggy when deploying new Metro Systems or other routes for public transport. Once you lay more than 10 stations of metro, and have a few lines running allready, you will start get lags and other issues like problems to move about, long waits while calculations are done.Another point here is that it seems they have downtweaked the amount of people using the metro and bus systems, making it harder to maintain traffic flow and forcing you to be really smart when planning ahead for a new metro system. This can of course just be my imagination, but I feel that I need to be more careful now than in previous games.OmnicorpOmniCorp trading is just the same as before.NEW:New content worth mentioningIt's worth mentioning a few of the things new to this game in terms of content. Here are a few things i've come across so far:Farm ploppingIt looks to me as if they have tweaked the plopping of farming zones, it is easier to make irregular shaped farms around corners and along the boundries of the areas where farms can be plopped.TerrainTerrain responds better to changes done by development. For example, you will notice that laying out all types of zones in slopes and uneven terrain is easier and you experience less problems with road issues (Where roads cannot be constructed.) This is done by finding alternative paths for them in a more smooth way. I like it this way, makes more sense.Metro tubes disappears during gameplayIf you construct tubes with max amount of stations, they will just disappear after a while, leaving only the stations behind and potentionally crushing your infrastructure. This has to be fixed at some stage very soon!ConclusionAll in all, the game is a fresh breeze of cold air on a hot summer day.. Still there are a few issues here and there, surely these will be fixed in later patches for THIS game and not for future COMPLETE rewrites of the engine.For theTL;DRfolks out there, many of the problematic traffic, population and polution issues are solved. And I can confirm that it runs on all my cores and has so far not burned up all my memory (at a stable 2.2GB RAM) I'd buy it.I give the game a 8/10 in terms of its current state, and 6/10 for the hefty price -  considering the amount of money I have spent on previous broken titles. Owners of  two or more from the same title should have received 75% off of the price.I can warmly recommend this game for newbs to the CXL scene, for you guys who own other games like this, or is saving up for Cities> Skyline, have a look at the myriad of new gameplay>videos and decide for your self - i`d buy it."

Performance is slightly improved from the previous version but there are some weird bugs now.Over 9+ hours of play this is what I have found that I consider game breaking:1. When you re-load a game the game forgets what ever trades you had set up. So as you may leave the game with a positive trade balance, you will now suddenly find yourself deeply in the hole.2. The moment I hit more than 500K people living in the city my office start dying for no apparent reason. This has a knockon effect to all the other industries. Basically the only way around this is to ""import"" office services, but that quickly eats up your exports (not to mention you cannot sell other stuff as they eat up your precious export slots).3. Randomly areas go from ""happy with entertainment"" to ""not enough entertainment"" even if nothing else has changed.As it stands, it's unplayable.

City building simulations are kinda rare, and I really liked Cities XL. It wasn't ground breaking, but an overall decent experience...The Graphics? Are quite good, actually. I like them. The game mechanics? Nothing revolutionary, but they do their job.Cities XXL isn't a bad game. I played it for short and it carried over the fascination of the previous installments. Actually, scrap that. It is pretty much the previous installment. And that's my major complaint. It doesn't really add to the franchise. You got the same world map, the same trade system (inter city and Omnicorp), the same buildings... oh, and even the same bugs. Allright, they added at least a tiny bit of new content... a handful of new buildings, a few new maps, some little recoloring and multicore support. Still, it's like they just copied and pasted the last incarnation, slapped a patch(!) over it and sell it now again. Yeah, you are paying for a patch. Or a stand-alone DLC, whatever. But it is not even one that fixes all the problems, that are haunting the game since, like, forever.It is, on a side note, also not the first time Focus did that with this game. I don't know what they are thinking. Program a patch, rerelease. Program a patch, rerelease. Program a patch... it is one of the purest versions of moneygrabbing. Unfortunatly, I fell for it. Won't happen again, Focus, I tell you that. This is the fifth(?) installment of the series. Don't just sell us an updated version of the same game over and over again. It's bad enough that other publishers, which I won't name here, do that the whole time. You know what I did with their games? I stopped buying them, because in my eyes it wasn't worth it. Please, stop doing this. Cities is one of the last city building simulations left, and I would hate so see it going down.As it is, I just can't recommend the game... at least if you already have one of the previous versions. There are way to little changes and content additions for a 20 Euro price tag. Everyone who hasn't got a game from the series might consider it... when it is on sale.

The game is identical to Cities XL 2012, still a great game but my advice is ""DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY OF THE CITIES XL SERIES"".2. The render engine has had some tweaks, but after an hour of game play I've been finding myself stuttering and jumping around and when rotating at times to build from another direction, it just locks up and jumps. My rig Win7 Ulti x64 - i7 4Ghz 16GB DDR GTX980 @1080p.3. The UI is now lots of grey boxes, why do I get the Windows 8 feeling from this thing?4. New music, love it! Shame there are only 4 or 5 tracks on repeat.5. New video intro6. Building snapping is a bit better, however I've noticed when joining zone areas it often just stops and requires me to click, anywhere just to get the thing going again.

And just as I re-ran the game, loaded up my save point after writing points 1 to 6 above, I now longer have the options for placing any new buildings for skilled, unskilled, elites and execs... hmmmIn short, still a good game (when it works), still better than sim city (for me), but lacking oh so much, but a good game none the less, still hours of fun and frustration.

As is stands with Cities XL Platinum it hard to recommend it.I have played Cites XL and enjoyed the breath of wonderful features and good graphics.  It allows for large cities in the millions, something Sim City has yet to do.Now to the changes, there are some changes from Cities XL:   user interfaces make over,  new/ugraded graphics engine, new music, and new upgrades to the buildings.    The user interface has been cleaned up and now looks more in line with Microsoft “Metro” look.  This works, It is easy to see and distinguish the icons.  I have seen little functionality changes though.  The newly upgraded engine is smoother show off better pixel shaders.  The engine is still fresh and I saw the roads gliching at certain zoom levels.  There are more and better skyboxes so that is a plus.  There are a few additional upgrades that you can add to the city utilities, but they are later in the game and look like minor changes gameplay.  The tutorial has not changed, for good or ill.  So what does $20/$40 get you?The good:Better engine, User interface, Sky boxes, Music varietyIndifferent:Fuctionallity (The same), Frame rate difference is hard to notice, Music changesThe bad:Still Glitchy, paying $20 for a large patchIf you want to get this game, buy fresh on a Steam sale.

The world map has hundreds of city sites you can build on, and each city can interact and trade with others. Each city you build stays there, and you can use its surplus resources to develop other cities, or contribute to megaprojects.The economy is balanced in such a way that although you could build a self-sufficient city, it is more productive to specialize  in some group of industries and trade. So you end up making rural agricultural towns, polluted industrial centers, busy office hubs, beautiful tourist spots, etc. Each place has a character and a reason for being.Trade between your own cities is completely up to you, without any buy or sell prices. You could send electricity from a more successful city to a struggling one for free, or also choose to send something else in return. For more conventional trade, there's the off-world megacorporation, which you can buy and sell resources from. The prices aren't very well thought out there, it's obvious the devs ran out of time. But the result of that isn't too bad, it just means many things are not profitable to sell and many things are not worth buying, which is somewhat reasonable even if it sometimes feels awkward (what do you mean I have plenty of oil, but exporting it actually loses me money?!). If you want an export-based economy, you have to figure out what you can make cheaply.The maps are very large, compared to some other city builders, and although I never ran into perf issues, others reported them for very large cities. Of course, nobody forces you to build a massive city either, so if you do run into problems, you can just do another city nearby and ship resources between them.There are some bugs and awkward UI that takes a little getting used to. You do need to save, because crashes do occasionally happen, especially if you have a lot of mods.And, yes, in all fairness, there isn't all that much new in XXL compared to XL, but I personally feel the extra megaprojects content was worth it (got it for $15, which is more than the current full price), and the whole point is moot anyway if you haven't played the older versions, so don't let the bad reviews based on that deter you from trying it.It's the best city builder game there is, as far as I'm concerned."

Overall it comes across as having all the ingredients to be the the greatest city building game ever, and If they fixed some of the flaws it would be great, as it is, I just can't recommend it.I know of the big furore over this game essentially being a poor update on a previously released title ""Cities XL"", but I never bought those games and cannot judge this game against it; this review will just be of the game on its own and in isolation. If anything my comparison point would be ""SimCity 4"", because like most people we've all just been crying out for a sequel to that game that has never happened (at least not how we wanted it, looking at you SimCity Societies).The Good:- You can build a city as pretty as the pictures above, it's all very zen.- The music is quite nice and generally the onscreen notifications aren't overwhelming or irritating.- Gameplay is fairly intuitive with nicely varied levels of difficulty, especially if you're used to the city building game format.- The trading system is balanced meaning specialisation of a city can be done easily, you want to build a tourist paradise or an farming utopia? Knock yourself out, it's a lot of flexibility with how you play.The Bad:- Poor terrain modification tools, the maps look how they look and you'd better like it.- The UI is a little bit clunky, occasionally you'll miss-click things.- Zoom out a little bit and all the vehicles turn to weird grey/black boxes on the road. It upsets your zen greatly.- I can build individual buildings to a style or I can basically pot-luck it with the city zoning, I can't just set a style of building? You crazy.- Roads vs Terrain, being unable to properly terraform the landscape makes this maddening however.- The tutorial thinks it's funny.The Ugly:- This game will crash on you, a lot, regularly.- Lag. Laaaaaaaaggggggg.Verdict:If they got rid of the ugly, you could live with the bad, with both however you end up struggling to play the game, this then magnifies any flaws with the game. Like old Lara Crofts terrible camera angles, or resident evils weird control schemes, you fight with them for a while and then you put the game down and you just never pick it up again."

Surely an interesting topic, especially if one goes by that even on lowest graphical settings a game in its endphase (and rig filling specifications) allegedly didn't uphold a proper game experience and should therefore fix an arguably essential issue for free. Myself I don't remember free nor discounted upgrade e.g. from Windows XP to Windows 7, to name an example of where there was apparently not really addition of features neither, while it was arguably laggy or such with plenty of stuff doing in XP. So such argument sure may seem valid a lot, but it does not really seem a proper review for the Cities XXL version anyhow.- and argument about an ""either - or"" approach, which may be understandable if one wants to point out what may seem a better alternative but in my view doesn't justify a negative review as such. Meaning that just because someone may have more fun with one title surely doesn't mean that every other title of such genre is bad just becuase of that.Anyhow, Cities XXL review of my own:Overally, I found the video game Cities XXL to be an enjoyable city building simulation, which offers complexity with not really need for tedious micromanaging (besides issue of that inter-city trading may have been made more streamlined by offering a global pool, but isn't really complicated as is).Various resources, possibility to build roads and large zones in different ways or plop individually, demands and desirabilities and population satisfactions (where eventual problems are mentioned with top bar where icons for industries, offices and workforces), plenty large maps in various setting (snow, beach, desert, greenlands), day-night cycle having various times of day with moving shadows and possible to switch inbetween (with moving cycle possible to be turned off), city overlay maps (such as for air or noise pollution, or particular satisfaction, and more), possibility to zoom-in to street level and as if walk around looking around, tutorial, possibilities with mods, all there.In terms of performance I can't complain. With a what I would call mid-range rig (multi 3,2GHz (64), GTX 760, and 8GB RAM) and everything set on high I didn't really experience lag, even with city size having more than 10 millions of population. That is that zooming in or out quickly from top to bottom or vice versa did show a fraction of second lag, similarly sometimes on street level looking around, and at night when zooming out it took a moment for all lights to be rendered, but besides such it was fluent all the time. In around 90 hours of gameplay I experienced a few crashes, but such as far as I remember only when leaving a map, which was not much an issue to me since it successfully saved the map before the crash, so no building time lost with it.As for gameplay more in detail:Cities XXL offers both sort of career mode for every map as well creative building possibilities straight on, meaning that one can go with starting with low density buildings and have further possibilites unlocked as the city grows in population (recommendable to learn the ropes and mechanics), or simply use in-game option to unlock most buildings straight away, or even called cheat to have e.g. cash added, or even have mod for such.Game is rather resource rich, ranging based on map limited resources such as water and food, to resources such as heavy industry and workforce split into 4 categories (with each category having housing of their own), which makes it on a larger scale a good idea to develop more than one map with each city specializing and trading with each other. But it is also possible to develop only one map-city while trading as possible and needed with Omnicorp (which is in-game a trading partner having unlimited resources to buy and sell, tho usually at a rate giving 2 resource tokens for 3 resource tokens taken, but also offering easy way to increase cash flow with resources traded from surplus). Specialization also brings possibilities to increase production of commercial resources a lot, meaning that map-total e.g. electricity production can be increased by 40% by placing one building only, which has prequisites to be unlocked. Many a resource usually requires other resources (e.g. heavy and manufacturing industry needs some offices, electricity, water, waste disposal, variously skilled workers, while needing to be near a freight connection such as road connection at map border, freight airport or harbour, and so on), which is why specializations are handy to use especially where the resource production requires upkeep (with every map supporting full specializations of max. two resources). Resources get distributed automatically within a city as long a road connection is there (including water and electricity).Inner-city mass transportation exists but unfortunately has only buses and subways (not counting mods) with no revenue from it (but limiting air pollution and usually decreasing travel time). Having to make those mass transportation lines manually is easy to do but may somewhat seem as micromanaging even tho with bus lines it requires no building of bus stops as in buildings taking up space at roads, and with subways it gives a map view where sub-stops are easily visible.Desirability factors (especially ""quality of life"") are important especially with higher tier buildings, such as offices and high-tech industry but also holiday hotels, which unlike business hotels require appropriate landmarks, which on some maps may be the whole coastal area in the beginning but usually require buildings (on maps with holiday resource). So while these things offer additional variety in terms of planning, I found the holiday factor in terms of gameplay rather boring quick tho since it doesn't seem that tourists have any impact whatsoever on retail nor leisure. So while it is easy to make a sort of eye-candy district for holiday hotels with retail and whatnot, in terms of gameplay it isn't really as if connected to each other as far as e.g. holiday hotels and retail is concerned, which is why I myself ended up trading for holidays from Omnicorp.While it may sound complicated that there are various resources with somewhat different requirements, it easy to keep track of, both in terms of having neat table overviews of which resources are lacking or too much off, but also since if e.g. offices lack business hotels the icon for offices in the top bar will turn yellow or even red with it telling what the issue is if one hovers with mouse over the icon.All in all, even tho not having a sort of endless career mode such as in terms of SimCity 4 filling a region map with cities for sake of having a view of a huge metropolis, plenty to do in career mode and even more if one enjoys creative building. Therefore from my side a recommendation for this city building simulator."

I'm quite enjoying playing this, it's quite relaxing, interesting and challenging - all at the same time. It seems complex and in-depth enough, although this is my first city-builder game (I haven't played any other, so I've nothing to compare it to).Graphics seem good enough, although there's a graphical glitch where a swathe of green is spread across parts of the map (I think this is a problem with my now-aging system rather than the fault of the game).I like that I can play it at my own speed (and indeed, it seems that the slower one tries to progress, the more one is likely to succeed). I can see myself sinking MANY hours into this game - and not regretting any of them.If you're new to this genre or not sure about this game in particluar, I recommend buying it.[EDIT]I now have almost 150 hours play time in this game - and I'm absolutely loving it!  I don't understand all the negative reviews - and if you read most of them, they're not actually about this game being bad, or having any particular problem - it's about this game being released as a separate game, instead of a free update to owners of the previous incarnation of the game. ""This game sucks - just because I don't like the marketing strategy of the game publisher!"" - yeah, that's what they essentially boil down to.I really feel that you can't go wrong with giving this *excellent* game a try!"

,Recommended,313010,14456140,"Posted: 13 February, 2015",all,Jimmy,"Swift ResponseThe initial response to the latest instalment of this huge city building game from focus interactive has been somewhat negative to say the least, certainly on Steam, you can’t move for cries of “rip off” and the now days inevitable  “Do not buy this game” threads.There is an element of validity to some of the criticism levelled at the title, but it needs to be taken in perspective, more on that later.Tailor madeSo, for the uninitiated, Cities XXL is a city building game on a huge scale.Think Sim City on steroids and you’ll be on the right track.In the equally criticised at launch title, Sim City, you were presented with a region in which you could choose a plot of land to found your city, or cities. In Cities XXL you are presented with a whole world to choose from!When you load up the game, you have a spinning globe in front of you with a multitude of vacant spots scattered across the continents, any of which you can select to build on.Each spot has its own levels of raw resources (water, arable land, oil etc.) and its own topography.You could pick an ocean side setting and build your own tourist capital, gleaming with glamorous hotels and a bustling centre of entertainment.You could choose an inland arable paradise with rolling farmland, nothing to break the sky line apart from the occasional silo stack you decide to drop down.From an Industrial smog filled manufacturing powerhouse to an elitist, country club dwelling hamlet of snobbery, you are not limited at all in what you can create.Blank SpaceOne of the noticeable differences which sets this title apart from its peers are the map sizes.There are no Sim City postage stamp sized maps here; no matter which location you choose to build on, the maps will be huge.You’re going to have space to plan out your city however you want, with multiple industrial, commercial and residential areas and still have room left for some pretty countrysideWonderlandIf you’ve played a city builder before you’re going to be on familiar ground here.You can choose between industrial, commercial and residential zones and their placement in relation to each other is key to keeping everyone happy.A nice aspect is the ability to choose the population density of each zone, High Density for any potential Sky Scrapers, medium density for multi-story buildings and low density for one or two stories.You can also place special themed buildings, beach huts, snowy log cabins etc. Which all help add flavour to the game.There are your usual requirements of water and electricity needs to be met through various power station types and water extraction facilities.There is also the really nice touch of being able to add parkland or plazas to fill in any gaps between your buildings and roads, this works like the fill brush in paint, click and it paint trees or slabs across the required area to fill in any gaps.I can’t state enough how much this fairly simple mechanic enhances the look of your city.Highway Don't CareCities XXL has a plethora of different road types to choose from, from small dirt tracks, through various sized avenues, expressways all the way up to highways. I haven’t encountered as many varied road types in any other game in the genre and it really does add something to the city creation experience.I Wish You WouldWhat CitiesXXL doesn’t have is a rail network and it is sorely missed.Why they’ve never chosen to incorporate train tracks and stations into the game I don’t know, maybe they’ve felt they had transport covered with all the different road types, but as great as the road choice is, I would have liked the option to have a train or two chugging around my metropolis.Shake It OffAnother thing that’s missing from Cities XXL that are the disasters, no tornado’s, no alien invasion to level your creation, not even an earthquake to shake your metropolis to ground when you’re board or frustrated with it.I Knew You Were TroubleAs I said at the start of this review, there’s a lot of anger out there on the inter-web at the time or writing, Some of which is trolling, but some is justified.Cities XL as a franchise has been around for a while now, it has seen several “updated” releases over the years and this is where most of the anger comes from.Each new release of the game, Cities XL, Cities XL Platinum, Cities XXL etc. are all essentially the same game.They look exactly the same and they play the same but with a few additional buildings added in to try and justify the “new” release and whilst focus often discount the new version for previous owners, they still charge around the £15, $20 mark for what is essentially the previous release with a small content pack added. Understandably this upsets people.There has also been a lot of talk about optimisation and the lack of multi core support in previous titles, the game tended to be more than a little laggy once your city grew to a respectable size.There's a new game engine this time around and it does seem to run a little smoother for me than it has in previous versions, however, I also have a much more powerful system now than I had when I played the previous version of the game which might have just as much to do with the performance improvement than any engine optimising that has gone on behind the scenes.----------------------------------------------------NEVER PLAYED A CITIES XL TITLE BEFORE?----------------------------------------------------Players gonna playViewed as a standalone title, and assuming you do not own any of the previous Cities XL titles, then this is game well worth the entry fee.There is a vast amount of city building fun to be had here, huge maps, huge numbers of varied building types, a nice selection of roads to watch get clogged up with traffic and it’s pretty good looking too.If you’re looking for a competent city builder that isn’t Sim City or Skylines then you should ignore the negativity surrounding this game and take the plunge.You’re very own metropolis awaits.Reccomended--------------------------------------------OWN A PREVIOUS CITIES XL TITLE?--------------------------------------------Haters gonna hateViewed as the next release in the series, Cities XXL does not do nearly enough to justify its price point. If you’ve played the previous titles, you’ve essentially already played this game and If you have any expectation of improved graphics (not that the graphics aren’t great anyway though) or improved game play you are going to be very disappointed.There just isn’t enough new content here to warrant a purchase unless you’re a huge fan of the franchise and really can’t live without that extra X in the title.Keep building in Platinum my friends, there’s nothing new for you to see here.Not Recommended( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visithttp://www.review-well.com/)"

I had Cities XL, but never really played it because it just didn't run well when I tried.   I figured that since it was half off and only $20, and everyone said it ran well, I'd give it a shot.The first major annoyance is that game doesnt use WASD and is fairly tedious in the controls.  The reactions for zooming and moving seem to have a bit of a lag and it's difficult to actually pinpoint where you want zones, roads, etc because of it.  I'm over the minimum for system requirements although I don't have a super gaming computer.  All the other games in my library have no issues of this type, including resource intense games like Watchdogs.I didn't spend a lot of time on the game, but it's not one of those learning curve type games where it gets better (for me at least)."

I had to post this review due to the amount of negative reviews and people blathering on about how much they like Cites Skylines. I find the game play mechanics in skylines clunky, and for me it's difficult to get a city going with possitive cash flow, sure I could watch some more youtube tutorials, but I don't feel like it, I rather just play something else. Like Cities XXL. Things in this game work intuitively and I have a possitive feeling as my city makes money and I unlock achievments and more things to place in my city. My city actually grows and I have fun, isn't that how a game is supposed to make you feel? This is the modern day successor to Sim City 2000 and 3000 (and 4k I suppose :-)) that we always wanted!

I like the fact you can choose street options (for example building lay out 2x4 , 2x5 and so on), i like the range of maps and slightly differnt UI.The roads can still be a bit of a pain to lay and especially things such as bridges and tunnels and joining avenues to roads and expressways...I really do enjoy the game, however i feel it can be a bit annoying when objects won't go in a space and the game does not give an indecation of why.For me, i only paid £15.00 for this game and it is a lovely step up from XL, but i can see how it for those with the newer versions of XL it feels like nothing has been changed.My verdict is if you dont own any of the previous cities games, get this one- It is really good.If you own XL (original) or older and you can get this at a good discounted price (like £15.00) go for it :)But if you have the newer ones, it may not be worth it..."

Having played this, Cities Skylines and Sim City (all of them) I can say they all kind of blur into each other and not one is perfect.Most of the negativity towards this game stems from the fact it is not much (if any) of an upgrade from Cities XL. I agree that it is not much of an upgrade. But that does not make the game bad it just means at the cost it's a bit disappointing (but still not bad) but if you don't have a previous version that negativity is void.The second thing that has also been complained about is the performance once the city starts to get larger. Well my quantum computer suffers none of this, and Skynot AI said ""Any more complaints and I'm going to remove humanity"" Has anyone looked at the interconnected complexity of any of these games?? most games when you are playing them have nothing going on when you are not in that area so of course they don't suffer this issue. BTW all the Sim City style games suffer this issue to some degree. It's more program than you can handle ;-)A few notes on the BIG 3If you want the best graphics, smoothest gameplay, smallest city, lacking mod support get Sim City (5 aka 2013 aka EA why oh why) it's not terrible but it could have been the one!If you want the most options to select where you want to build in the world get Cities XXLBut if you want the game with the most mods get Cities Skylines (what I think is the best allrounder)BTW the hours recorded by Steam is not even close."

I love the global overview off the starts that allows me to basically build several citites on a continent and attempt to balance economies by trading between them. Its adictive...I find myself spending an hour or more on each city of mine daily to increase population and balance trade. No bugs or lag issues to speak of. I have a solid 30fps at all times even when conducting long roadway placements. One week in and I've got 4 cities up to 300,000 and each has a market niche to generate revenue. Once you find what your city excels at you can either trade to the game 'OMNICORP' for cash flow or use it to balance your other cities shortcomings.

The biggest selling point for me was, i got it for 50% off, the maps are massive and Steam workshop is intergrated now.Though It's clear that not much is different and it has enraged an entire population of steam consumers who wanted something new and if you want a completley new game, don't bother.Buy this game for it's size and Steam Workshop, the devs are clearly supporting the modding community with this one and if things continue to go forward, like it has, this will be one of those titles that really benefits from the fans and the developers support of the fans.I have not experienced any issues with this game and definitely none of this lag that some people are reporting.Cities XXL is a game about creating epic cityscapes that span what seems like entire continents. I love how everything comes together and exploring the city you have created is so rewarding, especially when you get down to the street level. Obviously having a powerful rig helps in this case and it is worth having one, just to experience it.For those of you who would like refunds, it's too late.

The game engine has been improved and the detail that shines from your monitor is glorious to look at.This may look like Cities XL of old but if you just give it a chance and embrace the community around it, you will enjoy your time playing this. If you want a new game with the ability to micromanage every small detail of the cities execution find something else. Let the vast environments of XXL suck you in and just enjoy it, i do.Lastley i would like to add the following point. People are calling this a glorified patch for $20 but let's just agree to say it is and it would seem like a massive rip-off to all consumers to pay for a patch. Now, just think about every new game these days, they offer season passess for atleast $25 and map packs/skins new characters etc, some of which are extras outside the season pass inclusions. With this $20 patch, you get a new game engine, maps, challenges, buildings and workshop support, additionally whatever they decide to add later and it won't cost you anymore then $20. For a game to be released at such a low price and not even ask for a single cent more for content, you really can't beat that logic.Nb. i am expecting alot of hate for enjoying this game, i challenge those to just play it for a couple hours, you will like it."

If you're new to the city building genre then this is an adequate game and you'll have some fun with it. However if you have played one of the many iterations of the City XL franchise then there is very little to see here at this price. The new elements and enhancements to the game simply cannot justify the asking price of this game. The changes are worthy of a patch or maybe a low priced DLC, NOT a whole new game."

I'm a big fan of Cities Skylines and I have + 6000 hours on Simcity 2013. I think the devs made a mistake on how they presented Cities XXL. It's not that renewing compared to XL Platinum. However bugs are fixed and the game definetely performs better.In fact Cities XXL is a no-nonsense City builder and you can build really nice big cities. The trade system Omnicorn ha a little bit steep learning curve but is a great feature. The cities you build can trade with each other. The maps are very nice and there are plenty. The graphic setting of the buildings is realistic and the citizens a bit cartoonish.I recommend this game and give it a try especially when it's on sale.
,Recommended,313010,14367853,"Posted: 7 February, 2015",all,ThatsMichaelNow,"My Personal Review of Cities XXLFirst off, I put less than 2 hours playing CXLPlatnium, (which I did get on a deep discount), because of it's cam controls. Being able to get the latest version CXXL on a deep discount was a sweet bonus. I was hoping for a cam controls fix or at the very least, a place to adjust the sensitivity of the mouse movement. In spite of the cam controls, I spent no less than 22 hours straight playing once it was finished installing.An immediate reloading of the game from a shut down seems to bring about a downloading of data for the game each and every time it is re-loaded directly after shutting the game down (still looking into this). So, game re-load time is a bit slow. The cam controls are just the same as in CXL but I've decided to just do my best at learning to manipulate the cam and adjust to the super sensitivity of it. Alternatively, there are key commands that can be used to control the camming as well. During the first 20 hours of play, not once did the game ever crash on me. Kudos to the devs for that man. Not withstanding that at the time of posting this review, I found this tip posted by my good gamer buddy Monterico athttp://youtu.be/HQgg1S2OgBINow while I've not put hardly any time into the previous version, there are at least 3 noticeable differences between CXL and CXXL: 1. A whole new interface. Getting use to it was not difficult at all. 2. Adjustable sky options which act sort of like mood filters. The Rainbow and Black Storm are my favorites already. 3. New Maps. Oh yes, the maps are freaking huge and there are some new ones albeit I do not know at the moment which ones they are exactly. In any case, if you didn't like small map sizes in previous city building games, you'll spend a lot of time trying to fill up a map in CXXL.A sinde note here is that of the first 22 hours of game play, it never once crashed on me.The fact that I spent 22 hours straight playing this latest version should tell you a lot about my first impressions of the game. I love being creative but prefer low impact games due to my failing health issues. Use to love shooter games but now, I just like a game I can play while laid back. I was asked often last night while streaming my game play, ""So is it better than SimCity?"" To answer that in a nutshell, no, it is just another city builder style game. Big maps or small, I don't care about that and find that some of the gaming community is a little to stuck up and demanding when it comes to what ""they"" think should or should not be in a game of this style. I enjoyed SimCity a lot and the multi-player online feature was what made the the latest version so much fun. While CXXL does not have multi-player, the shear sizes of the maps should keep me busy for a very long while till ""No Mans Sky"" (the next game I am holding out for) is released at which time you may find my solely playing that exclusively if not permanently. Until then, sorry Maxis/EA, you just lost a loyal fan till you can come out with a bigger, better SimCity. :pI wonder how long it will take to even try to fill up a full map in CXXL. Guess well have to wait and see. Looks like I might have to go after the 10 million population achievment at least."

It can feel a bit lifeless in comparison to other modern city builders (notably CSL), and isn't that challenging, but it is my go to game for making beautiful, realistic cities.As far as technical issues, the game runs fine for me. Had it bug out on me once when I tried to place a blueprint structure.

(Cool mods out there, visit this linkhttp://xlnation.city/Playing mods are more better :) )- Pedestrian walking with styles (base on how they live in unskilled, skilled, executives, and elites)- Many landmarks in real life.- Can see pedestrian do in outside buildings. (Like beach, Stadium, and football field, go-kart, and etc)- Make more populations with unlock many options building. (Like on scenario campaign)- Have winter theme world and in snow buildings. (I like this)- It combines all previous Cities XL series in one game. (If you not have own previous Cities XL, this game is for you)- Can be trades resources in another regions. (If you have two worlds or more on earth)- Have cheat options such as add cash, unlock buildings, and more. ( still you get achievement if you play cheat :P )- Many more- I have upload a video about my gameplay 'Cities of Kuala Lumpur Malaysia' in Youtube, better watch it:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA8u92LdFqINotes: Buy this game when on discount, it very worth it and cheapest and also you will like it.

While I do agree that Cities Skylines is a better city simulator OVERALL than Cities XXL, the buildings and structures in Cities XXL looks way better and much more realistic to me than the buildings in Cities Skylines. When you are down at ground level simply looking around, down the street and/or across the way,etc. Cities XXL is a better experience in my opinion. I therefore play both and would recommend this game to anyone truly interested in ALL aspects of city building simulation - especially if you don't already own Cities XL."

The exact building is a must. EX. Clicking on a residence shows need for education, open menu to schools and they have yellow and green borders around them. That means....er...um.. idk so I place the green one(10-18yr old) on an adjacent block wait a few ticks....nope, must be the yellow one(elementary), place it too right next to it, Wait a few ticks...nope. open menu again and see there isn't anything left but a school that is 10-14yr old and not 10-18yr old and place it and bam they are happy. What?...Retail is broken the same way. Demand is huge groceries but if you place a zone the game will put down a bar. Place a whole block and it will put a shopping mall, bar, and everything else but groceries, then commerce will start to go OOB because to much retail. No problem I'll sell excess to Omnicorp....oh wait they don't buy retail. SO a huge block of commercial next to residence and still dissatisfied cause they want a grocery store. Now you can manually place a grocery store, but you can only guess at what specific building they want by plopping down ...test ...destroy, plop down different one....test.Hi-tech says it uses waste, but in fact it uses the resource of waste removal, so it produces waste...er no cause if the waste removal resource is used up, they just go bankrupt.Size of fields do not equate to product produced. Ex. 30x30 forest vs a 4x4 park. Yes the 4x4 park @ 5k per tick reduces pollution better. So how about a 6x6 park? Nope, does nothing. Garbage dump 4x4 costs the same as one 10x10 and produces the same er... rids the same amount of waste and produces less pollution.Bus and Subways are designed so segregation of class blocks are the only cost effective way to use.Memory leak is still an issue, runs fine for a couple of hours post 500k, but then just gets worse until close and restart. Still not as bad as XL.Factories have to be placed at borders next to city connections or they will pollute and destroy your city and not be profitable for the lack of freight. They did add making building E+ friendly, but hardly ever stays when you switch from one city to the other. (there is a workshop fix, but that is not what I am reviewing)If you are going to buy and play this game, a pre-fab computer from Best Buy will not cut it. You need quality parts not new parts. The pc I use is 6 years old home build. Yes VISTA was brand new at the time. I play a lot of different games and have no issues at max settings.AMD Phenom II x4 955Radeon HD68708G ramWin 7 pro (blu ray playback forced the upgrade)Nothing special by today's standards, but runs game fine for hours.I'm not going to mention the UI, it is bad but there are other reviews that beat that horse to death.Recomend?

On the negative side, it really isn't significantly different from Cities XL, so I don't see how the publisher can even call this a new game.However, the big problem with Cities XL was that it would slow WAY down once your city got bigger, and they do seem to have done a lot to address that problem with this version.So this is a OK city builder to buy. If you already have Cities XL and don't mind paying $20 to get a version of that game that actually works OK, then go ahead. Just don't be deceived into thinking that this is a radically different version."

I still would buy if it was released today though.I like that the cities are large (not like Simcity), but size isn't everything.. The game needs to be fun. The cities seem to run well so far, the Steam workshop is a very nice feature and will continue to grow, some added buildings, like the bridges/road options, freeways, etc. Zooming in and seeing things in more detail is nice, clicking a car and seeing things from that cars perspective going through the city is nice. I also want to mention that there are some cool building options.. I just noticed I can place certain restaurants, a night club, etc. There are a lot of cool new buildings that you can select and place; this is in addition to the standard ones that develop in zones. These extra buildings are growing on me, and really could help make this game much more enjoyable for me.There are tutorials in the beginning menu, and I suspect most people have not even looked at them. I am going through some of them now, and they are very nice. There also is a hidden menu on the right that shows more detailed information like traffic areas on the map, satisfaction, etc. If you hover your mouse way to the far right of the sceen the extra options come up; this is in addition the menu options of top of the screen..As the city gets larger it becomes more of a joy to play.. I am enjoying setting up the transportation system, seeing the city expand, demand change, etc.Things I don't like include the buildings don't develop like in Simcity which to me is a big deal (at least it was for me when I first started playing), the city progression starts out really slow (demand for goods seems to stay pretty low for a while which I think is where some people lose interest, but it gets a lot funner soon after), and the graphics/buildings aren't all that exciting to me (it is growing on me though like I mentioned in regards to the specialized buildings). Trade/manufacturing chains are to simplistic. .I'd say if you want a large city builder this could keep you entertained, but shouldn't be the only city builder in your aresenal imo. City Skylines looks like it will be good as well, Simcity was nice from the manufacturing/trading standpoint and it was fun, but small maps. If it were me and I either liked Cities XL but wanted better performance, or you like city builders in general I'd pick this up. I will say that we also live in an 'instant gratification' world, and 1 hour of gameplay isn't going to do it for those people; so expect to see the enjoyment increase as the cities grow.I will say I haven't developed a 'huge' city yet mostly because it starts out really slow, but I am now enjoying this game and see myself playing this more."

I love City builders and this game in all its versions has sersiously frustrated me. It's a good game but just as you get going in the previous versions it would lag to an unplayable state.That being said, I want to note a few things for people that are considering buying this for first time as well as upgrading.1) So far im well past population where issues start occuring in the old version and I have flawless performance. So the folks on here and youtube that are stating there is no performance increase I'm calling BS.2) It's a GREAT City builder that got a bad rep because of past versions performance issues (this HAS been fixed)Now on to a few points concerning the company.Do I think they are shady and does it anger me that I had to pay 20 bucks for a patch? YesIs this the same game reskinned? YesIs it a bad game? NOThe people raging on Steam are simply♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off that this isn't a new game. I watched the trailers and any people that has played the previous games would know by looking at the trailers that it was the same game. What do you expect? They have released 3 ""new versions"" that were literally the same game. I didnt expect any less. I just wanted the performance fixed so I could enjoy the damn game for what it was and unfortunately I was forced to pay $20 to do so.Focus you should be ASHAMED for treating your players like that.They said a long time ago that the game needed to be rebuilt to get multicore support and maybe thats how the justified the ""new game"" this time. But its the same game WITH MULTICORE. People are saying there is no multicore support when indeed there is you can see it in your CPU monitor.Is it even across all cores? No, but it works and it runs great.So take the complaining with a grain of salt. A lot of people expected something different when the trailers clearly showed the same damn game and anyone that spent any time in XL knows it.Thanks and I hope this helps you buy or not buy the game.

Because of how poorly optimized the last Cities games were, people began developing some sort of bias that any future Cities game will always be bad. That's not the case here, anymore.Cities XXL is actually a big improvement from Cities XL 2012.I remember getting CXL12 back in 2013, and that was sort of my replacement for the awful SimCity game. Originally, I thought it was pretty cool. I made over 20 cities in a span of 5 months, but that's not the point. The game was no longer stable by the time my city was as big as a quarter of the map, and that's not good, of course. After a year-long hiatus from the game, I've wanted to play it again, but it's not even playable anymore. The game would randomly crash every 15 minutes or so, and that was very bothersome, and the game couldn't go above 30 fps, and it basically became a slideshow. CXL12 was ruined for me.But that was when I realized that I could get CXXL for a 50% discount. I've looked on their website and it says that they've improved their engine, which would make the game run faster. Being a customer of Focus for over 10 years, I knew they wouldn't lie to me, so on the day my father gave me a $50 Steam gift card, that was the first thing I bought with it.I began playing the game now and wow, they really weren't lying. There was definitely some improvements to the game's engine. Of course it still goes crazy after about 10 million residents, but remember, this engine is based off of a 2005 game engine that can only useonecore, which is pretty impressive if that's true. My game was able to stay at a stable 60 fps even with a million residents, and so far, no crashes yet!This proves once again that a terrible video game franchise CAN become good if problems are fixed.

However if you insist on getting a Cities XL game then XXL is the one to get.Coming from Cities XL 2012 to this, gameplay wise, its almost exactly the same game.Its got the same UI, just recoloured from blue to black (although it does look a little more tidy).Resources are still all the same as well as all the categories of buildings such as heavy industry.I have noticed a few new features and buildings in the game such as being able to edit how many plots the game places in the square building zones when building and choosing if the game places plots on one side or both sides of the road with the linear zoning tool. New buildings include things like the pollution sensors and electric car dealership just to name a few.Now whether these new features and buildings were in Cities XL Platinum, I have no idea. I never played Platinum or have seen any gameplay of it.The graphics look slightly better in this than Cities XL 2012 but its really not by much. I'm not sure if its me but the colours look a bit more vibrant in XXL though.Performance is much better in this than XL 2012. Focus Interactive have finally figured out that multicore computers are a real thing. In Cities XL 2012 there would be a noticeable drop in performance once your city hit around 50k population and would gradually get even worse as the population grew. In Cities XXL however, I have a city with 600k people and although there is a bit of a loss in perfomance it is no way near as bad as XL 2012 and still perfectly playable.For a new player to the Cities XL/XXL this game would probably be an 8.5/10. For a player who has owned previous Cities XL games its a 5/10 at best.So basically if you're new to the Cities XL/XXL franchise. Get this.If you've owned previous Cities XL games and are willing to pay for some really minor new features and multicore support then get this but maybe wait for a sale.If the performance of previous Cities XL games doesn't bother you then don't get thisI'm gonna vote yes to this game simply because of the fact that you can now build massive cities and still get a playable frame rate which in previous titles was almost impossible.TL;DRThe performance is a lot better. The are some very minor new features. Other than that its pretty much the same as previous Cities XL games."

It runs smoother than previous versions and does not sufer from the horrible memory leaks found in prior titles. I find the new UI to be a step in the wronge direction. Much of the text is hard to read because the colors are so close (black text on a grey background for example.) It does take up slightly less screen space so those with smaller monitors may find that a plus.As far as what is new:- The new freight airport is a nice addition.- Also found in the marinas is a few new leisure options to make the waterways more usefull.- In the view panel you have the option to set a different background option and is nice for screenshots.- Some of the roadways are available from the start without turning on expert mode. This helps early game traffic managment and city planning.The main reason i recomend this title is for the people who have not played this title before and are looking for alternatives to games like SimCity. This title has the feel of SimCity 4 but with greatly improved graphics and trade options done on very large maps. It does however have it's own bugs and oddities though most are just anoying in this version and not game breaking. The steam workshop support allows for easy mod access. If you are new to the series watch some youtube video's and tutorials first (as mentioned before Cities Xl 2012 videos are still valid with only minor changes.) This game is not like other city building games and you will want to get used to the diferences.

My advice when you start is to not skimp on roads!!! Congestion becomes a real problem at around 20k, and then you probably have too many things connecting to small roads and would need to knock them down -- that is unless there is an upgrade feature, but I haven't found it yet if there is.The negative reviews appear to be an angry mob, rather than a coherent group of people experiencing real problems with the gameplay. I haven't experienced any problems, however, the one thing that did frustrate me was the no load of a self-saved game at menu, BUT once it loads from autosave you can load your Save, so that is not an issue at all.

Its nearly the same.+ New maps and new music. But the music is also a negative part, but we will get to this later.+ I already have a pretty big city and didn't experience fps drops so far.And now the negative parts:- The music. Really, am I the only one who thinks that this music is absolutely depressing? Its a sad, female voice most of the time, it gives you the feeling you are doing something terrible, like killing a family with a shovel or something. I accept the typical citybuilding - chillout music, but this? Okay, its only my taste.- A few graphic glitches, like flickering streets in building mode and stuff like that. Nothing they coulnd't fix in a few small patches.- As I mentioned in the positive part - this game is very similar to Cities XL. Very, VERY similar. Imagine Cities XL with a black interface and thats it.- Wrong messages. At something around 2.500 Citizens you get the achivement you unlocked the medium buildings for the workers and the supply stuff, like electricity. Wrong message, because this happens at 5.000 citizens.After the first small game I can say: This game is definitly not 'new' its basically Cities XL with a new Interface. If you like City building games you can buy it, if they fix the small bugs I mentioned above.And please, developers, give us some happy music. Make it dubstep if you have to, but not this depressing stuff which makes the game hard because you cant see♥♥♥♥♥♥thorugh your manly tears."

With that said, the game does indeed have multi-core support, and runs very smooth. It has full Steam integration, with Workshop support. It does have some new content, though much of the game is the same. Clouds, and other little features are sprinkled around the game.Basically, everything that they said was going to be added, was. It's worth the $40.00 bucks if you haven't played it before, as it is the prettiest city building game around by far. Its worth $20.00 as an upgrade, because multi-core does indeed work, and works well.Anyone hating on the game, saying nothing was added is wrong. By default, the mere fact that multi-core was added makes their statement wrong, as that is not something that is just easily tacked on. As it stands now, a lot of the bigger mods, such as RHM aren't compatible, but is already starting to be converted over. Is XXL perfect? No. Is it an improvement over Platinum? Yes, a big one.

If you like city building games it's worth picking up on sale. The game looks ok but still seems like the developer copy/pasted the old game into the new game. The multithread support helps however it still seems the game is jittery and has lots of screen tear issues (no vertical sync option?). I have an i7-4770k and every game I have thrown at it runs smooth except this game, the screen tears are really just annoying more than anything. The game is great for capturing single screenshots of HUGE cities and the trading works well (although can be easily exploited). I don't yet have a lot of hours however I can already see it's almost identical to the previous games, of which I own them all.Overall I have liked the previous games and this is the best of the series. That being said, it's more of the same old game. I'll dump 50 hours or so into it within the next few months, but it's not going to blow me away. It's still better than SimCity though since I can have a functional city larger than the size of a single neighborhood.

I LOVE THIS GAME!!!The positives:- The graphic are great!- Things are running smoothly on my machine- I like driving through my city and standing on top of buildings looking at what I've done- The farms are expansive- It's really fun seeing all the different buildings- It's challenging trying to balance the city needs, especially trying to solve traffic issues- I love that services are distance-based and not radial, and they have decent coverage- There are so many things to do and new things unlocking all the time- The tutorials help a LOT- I haven't encountered a single bug.The negatives:- The MUSIC... omg- It's lacking some flexibility with the roads (tight angles, on/off ramps... maybe I just haven't gotten that far)- I don't like having to bulldoze long stretches of roads to make minor tweaks and to upgrade roads.- It's more difficult than I thought to master the mechanics.- The ""look around"" feature with the mouse wheel is WAY too sensitive. It's an art form to pan where you want.- I wish I could choose whether or not to have suspension beams on my high-traffic viaducts.- It's kind of a pain having to drill down into each tool (and having it reset the default tool)The neutrals:- The controls are fine once you know how to use them, although some people are REALLY passionate about this.- The UI is intuitive and clean in my opinion. I used the tutorial so I know where everything is.Overall, I REALLY like this game so far, although I do get what people are saying about not being able to ""connect"" with the game. Something is lacking there, but I can't put my finger on it. Still I find it very enjoyable. I personally think the developers did a great job because the game is beautiful. I can imagine the challenges they went through. I think people are nitpicking over some very small things, but maybe I feel that way because I haven't owned a previous version of this game (and that was by choice, not from a lack of knowledge about the game)."

Stop reading the thumbs down reviews. they really aren't helpful….period. If you're looking at it, it's most likely because you are looking for a more original city building simulation game. Its simple mechanics allow you to focus more on the city building while easily managing economic efficiency.Once you spend the first 30 minutes going thru the tutorial *i recommend* your basicly ready to lay out something quickly and effectively. Starting is very simple and allows you to focus on the design and layout. While later slowly introducing elements that open up more economic strategy. City utilities are managed on a simpler and more macro size scale. You can create trade routes between two cities to share resources, *yet to explore it more* and so on.Basicly its enjoyable.Now for quality. This game has no more bugs than an average AAA title does that releases for “your console of choice” or any other system. I personally have not run into anything. I have a 2014 edition of the razer “blade pro” playing on full settings at 3k. I have not experienced any lag or slowdown. I average about 60 fps and dips down to about 45 fps while exploring on ground level. So im sure anyone with a mid core gaming desktop or consumer laptop should be able to run this ok. I have also managed to run it on low settings on a surface pro 3 i5 variant. Runs around 20fps, so hopefully that gives you a benchmark range of what to expect.Well what's with all Bad hype behind Cities XXL?Lets be real, what more do you want to see from this particular series? A future space theme skinned game that really gets no improvement in gameplay and just adds more bugs?If you are familiar with the Cities XL game and really enjoyed it for what it was, then you will like Cities XXL. Not a lot of re learning so we can focus more on what we love to do. Build huge gigantic cities! I dont have the biggest city yet *only been playing for about 3 hours on 5x speed* but so far iv not run into many hitches.Cities XXL is basicly the same thing as Simcity: Cities of tomorrow was. But less disappointing.To be fair in their advertising “at least from what i saw” never said it was going to be a new engine. And all the screenshots look like they might have been taken from Cities XL. So what did you expect when buying itt? I feel the game undertook some massive improvements as far as rendering, and speed. I treated this buy more like an expansion then a whole new game. Yes it does suck they did not just improve the old engine but.I mean we got multiple truck simulators, farm simulators, bus sim…..you get the idea. Only so much can be done with a game series that is so fragile right now no one wants screw anything up.They added steam workshop content to the game and which is like the developers giving us the tools to build whatever you want. So for the hardcore citie player you have nothing to complain about. If we give it a chance to grow it has the chance to become basically whatever we want.No online multiplayer, And honestly this should really be no surprise. Games like Anno and Simcity do not have the best track record of been successful at multiplayer online. Why risk breaking a perfectly playable game with multiplayer. We can still share cities with our friends.Steam workshop. Must i say more?In short i got exactly what i wanted. Hoping that the community will grasp it and love it for what i believe it deserves.7/10 would buy again. I really want the creationist user to grasp modding this game.

Having purchased this for 50% off, I cannot complain about the price.  I enjoy sandbox simulation games and though I loved SimCity, this is the next level.  Mind you, these are merely my initial impressions based on only 30 minutes or so of gameplay."

(No longer true, the forums have become a bastion of help and support, very good turn around, people are now free to complian about the game as well).There still are some issues with MODS causing crashes, and the 2 patches that were implementd did cause problems for some.I think I WOULD RECOMMEND this now, the MODS are excellent and it's kept me enthralled for nearly 125 hours I think.You may  need to be prepared for to do some tweaking though, there are step ny step instructions on the forum and it only happens around certain mods and patches.I'm REALLY ENJOYING IT NOW!"

It seems to have helped a little bit, but it's still not exactly butter smooth.*The game is a resource hog, but you'll be able to power through it with a quad core. Graphics requirements are mild.* It does seem to have some lags when you're changing your zoom and going through different tools because its pulling textures and file from my HDD on the fly - something many games get away with these days.*The ""upgrades"" not enough to get me back in after the last ones, though some new tools and tweaks make life a little easier. For someone brand new to this franchise, you'll probably love the scale. I know I did with these games. I've always thought of them as more of a sandbox than a challenge in management. They do make mechanics and cause - effect simulations pretty easy to figure out, so you can learn it pretty fast."

Keep your money, go to Cities Skylines.(The only way I see that this game will get back a good review is if micromanaging got a huge upgrade and being able to see almost every little stat in your town like how many crimes, where those crimes are committed, how efficient is your facilities are being, basically redo the whole game please, that'd be grat)"

76561197978815095,Not Recommended,313010,14344887,"Posted: 5 February, 2015",all,SirLANsalot,"The game is very well done with some immense maps, I mean these things are BIG, and they are bigger then the ones in the first XL game (the prior one) hence the extra X.  Not much was changed over the older one, but the game was updated to handle the bigger maps/cities that the old one choked on.  All the negitive nacys are just idiots and have zero sense of game desgin.Game runs far better then the old one, even though I never got very far in the last one.  One thing that is still lacking for a good game is multiplayer, to work together to build a mega city.  The maps are by far big enough to support it.With Steam Workshop support I am sure someone will figure out how to add it in via modding.  At least this one has steam support so cool stuff like that CAN happen.Overall the game is great if you like to build super cities, and were found lacking in the new Sim City (I felt the same way, game was good but needed bigger building plots).The game is very playable now (over the old one), however that is all dependent on your computers hardware configuration AND what other programs are running the background.However despite all of that, Cites: Skyline is much more sim city, then this game is, hence now a negative recommendation"
