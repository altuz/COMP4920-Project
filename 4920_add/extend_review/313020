Killed a guy? Go to Jail. Avoided a fight with the guy? Go to Jail. Punched him out and left? Go to Jail. Ran away from the cops questioning you with your godlike agility? You get caught, go to Jail.This section is the most indicative of the game, what little choice you have is invalidated when the game has few actual choices, and no matter what happens, you always 'win'. The worst case is that you defeat the evil and end up in an asylum, but only comes about from the most rampant disregard of common sense.Linear plot that varies by about three choices, railroaded locations that can't be avoided, once you've played through, a second playthrough consists of 70% of the same material, no matter what you do. Not worth money."

Games that reinterpret classic books usually end up being tedious and ruin the original work.Soul Gambler, on the other hand, is a beautiful modernization with an elegant subtext of its own.Our main character, Faust, is easy to empathize with. He is a young adult stuck in the dreary routine of everyday life: bored and jaded - until an old crone makes him an offer he cannot refuse... He is given the opportunity to sell pieces of his soul to rearrange the reality according to his own whims. We make some choices and live through their consequences while trying to discover the actual price of our new found powers.The display is quite basic; with hand-drawn art and thrilling soundtrack. The story is incredibly well put, with consistent references to the actual tale and a well weaved world of its own. The narration is easy to follow and sets an air of mystery and the thrill of the unknown successfully. As a visual novel, it presents actual replayability and several different endings to discover based on your choices.As a surprising side note the price of the game hits ridiculously low from time to time, it is a welcome addition to anyone's library. You shouldn't think twice before grabbing it. As a modern interpretation of the classical Faustus tale, this visual novel is a marvelous little gem for the ones that enjoy a mystical story.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

I am happy to report that this has finally been addressed with what I believe was a new programming team if I understand things correctly.Anyway, I was pleased to finally be able to play this game, and it was actually quite enjoyable, so in this case, it was well worth the wait. It's an interactive novel presented in comic book fashion, with the page frames and such. The artwork is quality. You would expect to see this published by a larger comic company if it was in paper form due to the excellent artwork and coloring. The story was also well written and engaging, and in fact, there seem to be many variations on how this tale can play out, so it carries a choose your own adventure style to it as well. You start out with some very basic RPG options which impact your choices later. There aren't upgrades or anything....whatever you choose is what you stick with, although your choices may end up adjusting some of the stats as part of the story.There are some issues with the actual script itself, such as poor sentence structure at certain points (much like my writing here in this review, lol). It seems like English may not have been the original language for this script, and the translation was solid with just a few blemishes. Anyway, nothing major, but you will notice it when you read through the text.The OST was quite nice, and appropriate to the theme of the game as well.All told, I think I give this game an 8 out of 10 surprisingly, and I would encourage people to read the more recent reviews when making a determination as to whether or not you might purchase this game, as the technical issues that caused a lot of the negative reviews have been solved at this point."

The story was interesting and the different choices certainly had you involved. However, being one that wants to get 100% of the story and achievements (100% story you need to go through every possible dialogue; there are guides for 100% achievements), I sort of wished there was an auto-read or skip function after playing for a few hours that I ended up button mashing to skip the dialogues that I had read several times over.I certainly liked the comic book style they were going for with this--it adds to its charm. There were some minor typos here and there, but nothing that was too distracting to take away attention from the story. The soundtrack was lovely--save for at the credits. I expected an elongated version rather than a loop-track to play for it. But despite all these minor things, I found the game enjoyable and interesting and would definitely play it again.

I spent enough time goofing off with it to make it worth the investment, and I have had friends play it while over and like the play. I also got it VERY cheaply, so that helps. Do I recommend it to others? I'm torn on that. Honestly, I wish I had a ""well, it depends"" option.The pros to this game are that it is shorter, can be completed fairly easily, and that it has an interesting story buried in it. I also like the art style and, in my opinion, it made playing through everything fun.The shortcomings to this game are that choice, or what you can do, oftentimes lead to the same outcome. I went through the entire game multiple times to see where every option went, and many simply ended in the same place. I get that this was because the story was leading me somewhere and I can forgive it somewhat, BUT it really did make me question why I should invest replay time when all roads lead to the same highway.I like what they were trying to do here, and it makes a decent play on the extremely cheap side, but there are things that need a bit of rework to make something like this solid.

You yearn for excitement, adventure, and maybe even a bit of romance. You could leave it all behind, but you've become paralyzed by your own fear of failure and have no way to overcome it until you're introduced to the world of soul gambling. Turns out your soul is good for something after all. In fact, your soul can be used to change the very fabric of reality — if you're willing to make the gamble. Each choice you make determines your path.The story isn't incredibly complex, but there are quite a few different endings, and even more special pieces of dialogue you can only unlock through certain choices. I recommend playing more than once because each playthrough is different. The first time around, I got the best ending, but it was fun going through it all again to see where my choices would have brought me if I hadn't been quite so, uh, moral in my choices. A few of the things I did made me almost proud that I had the forethought to hedge my bets, and other choices left me feeling sorry for my character, because I knew that I had not given him the best path that time around.The art is decent, but a lot of assets are reused many times. In my opinion, this doesn't really detract from the game, but your mileage may vary. This game is more story-driven than anything so don't buy this if you don't enjoy reading. I'd hesitate to call this a visual novel, but that's essentially what is is. One problem, though: there is no ""skip"" button. You'll be desperately clicking through a lot of text you've already read when you're on your second, third, fourth, and fifth playthroughs.The bottom line is that Soul Gambler is a really great game for the price. If this is your type of thing, there are enough mysteries and secrets and hidden dialogues and ending to keep you busy for a few hours."

The story is about an average guy called Faust, who gets plunged into a hidden side of the world where souls are a currency that can be used to make wishes come true. Like all currencies, souls can also be used to wager (hence the title of the game).The story is told by means of comic book-styled illustrations that are easy on the eye. The background music is subtle and atmospheric. It is up to you, the player, to make decision after decision for Faust, which will decide his fate at the end of the novel. The story branches out a lot and there are 5 distinct endings. At the start of the novel, you get to spend some points in any of 4 'skills' that Faust has. These determine which options you will or will not get in conversations and situations, further branching out the possible paths the story can take.If you go through the novel once, so only viewing one of the paths, you'll likely finish it in less than an hour. But the story is interesting enough to at least go through it twice, taking a completely different path the second time just to see how things turn out. In the case of 'Soul Gambler', the Steam Achievements add an extra layer to the novel and a welcome extra motivation to try and get to see all the possible branches. It is surpising how many paths there are. I went through the novel 5 times and got all the achievements, and according to the in-game counter, I still have only seen 86% of the novel."

The multiple outcomes added a lot of replay value to the game: a single run of the game lasts about one hour and you can get up to five different endings.The main character is inspired in Goethe's Faust, like he was a ""modern version"" of him. Great allusion! Faust has boring job and an ordinary life, but all of that changes when he sells his soul (voluntarily or not) to a witch and now can fulfil his desires. Each wish granted takes away a part of his soul and that can self-destruct him.

It is not so much about an game-experience but self-experience. It is an touching game if you take your time and just do what you would do by having the same choices and chances as the main character has. You figure out luck and waste chances while you are trying to find out why you are in your position in the first place.The contra-side:As charming as the game is, you will need to run through the game again, having the knowledge you haven't had before and that is making your choices become more or less incorrect to what you would do usually. Therefore you are only trying to break your own destiny. You are desperately searching for the best outcome and I bet you will make it all worse.My thought:This game is art and not really gaming. The clicking of up to 4 possible answers/reactions on any given moment will change your personal outcome and represent how miserable your life is. It is deep, hard and true.So:As I said before, I like games like this. The almost everlasting run for the best possible ending on the other hand turns games like this into an mountain you can never climb up on to see what would happen by the change of every single choise. It would just take to long. But as morbid and macabre entertaiment it is.. I will surely give it at least one or two more runs and see what may change in the end.Recomended to ""Story-Based""-Gamers 9/10"

If you bear with it, there are interesting moments, even if just to see what the writers had in mind.What first caught my eye was, of course, the the incredibly sexy red-head hanging over Faust's shoulder. The art style really appeals to me and I love that the graphical user interface and scene composition is made up of comic book elements! The characters are mildly interesting but ultimately it's this red head, andher presence changing the scenes to macabre versions of themselves, which kept me playing.Now, the story has some serious moments and some of the explanatory options do satisfy my curiosity, but overall the dialogue feels strange to me: ""I couldn't understand this entire situation."" for example. The few atmospheric NPCs (doctor, flight attendant, your boss) are not using lingo fit for their professions: ""Keep yourself quiet. You need to rest. I've requested more exams to better understand your health status and what happened to you."" It's not intolerable and can be amusing. One solid gripe I'll offer is my annoyance with the repetitive music, which loops itself far too quickly.I haven't played any other game (so far) that involved making choices around gambling/bargaining your soul off and while there aren't an awful lot of long-drawn out or creative choices, there's just enough content to appropriately play out the story.Some WTF moments.

I won't get into details but the tale is about mystery and romance and the manuscript is quite pleasant. This is not a child feature though because there is some drugs and murders included.The chances to affect in tale are various and it should take 5 or 6 times to see every possible dialogue and event. The diversity of storyline is achived with the decision crossroads and four different attributes chosen in a beginning.  Although 'all roads lead to Rome' - the choices made aren't remarkable. No matter how you played your cards you are more or less chained to follow the main agenda.The graphically well drown Soul Gambler might not be the long lasting joy taking only 1 hour to complete, but the decision points add some re-play value for as long as player is not annoyed of already seen events.In my opinion Soul Gambler is good for its price and great when on sale.

While the low stats may prevent you accessing some dialogues, the higher ones opens new directions to the story.However, The game normally takes 1~2 hours to finish.

,Recommended,313020,28883015,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,Strange,"The revamped Soul Gambler tells the legend of Faust through a glorious interactive graphic novel.Plot (4/5)You start off the game as a man named Faust who seems to be the unluckiest person on the planet and has a terribly boring, humdrum existence. One day while leaving work, Faust is approached by a mysterious woman that offers to grant him any wish in exchange for him selling part of his soul. And so the soul gambling (or not) begins.While the game seemed pretty silly at first, I was intrigued by what was actually going on towards the end. The earlier parts seemed a bit like the movie ""Bedazzled"" - you know the movie with Brendan Fraser being tempted by Elizabeth Hurley as the Devil? Oh wait a minute, I just discovered it's a remake of a 1967 film which is in turn a comedic retelling of the Faust legend - so that's probably why this game reminded me of that particular movie :).The game does become a bit more serious towards the end though and it seems more is at stake than some harmless granting of wishes.Gameplay (4/5)The game is a visual novel which means it's a narrative where you can change how the story unfolds depending on which choices you make - a bit like those Choose Your Own Adventure books of the 80s. So gameplay is pretty simple although I have to give some credit to Tion Studios since they've made it slightly different to many visual novels in that they've incorporated rudimentary stats to the game a bit like a role-playing game. You can choose to invest points in the beginning for things like strength, intelligence and charisma, and at certain points of the game it will perform a check against your stats in order to determine whether you are successful with certain encounters or not (e.g. checking you have high enough intelligence to provide some extra insight).Sound (5/5)The game contains no voice acting and has minimal sound effects. No issues with the audio.Music (2/5)Music is okay but there's only four tracks in the soundtrack and they're actually selling it as paid DLC! Sure it's only $2 for an artbook and the soundtrack but you can definitely find better value with respect to DLC elsewhere.Graphics (3/5)The game has some good artwork of the comic book variety. Sometimes the style even reminds me of the early Broken Sword games.Replay (1/5)Since it only took me 40 minutes for one playthrough of this game, you can tell it's a very short game, even by visual novel standards. There are also no Steam achievements even though the game has in-game achievements - surely it wouldn't have been too much to ask them to integrate it with Steam's achievements right (although admittedly, I've never done it myself so who knows)? Being a visual novel though, there's bound to be different paths you can take depending on what stats you pick at the beginning of the game and what choices you make in the game proper.Polish (5/5)I didn't encounter any serious bugs while playing this game and the interface seemed intuitive enough.Summary :Soul Gambler happens to introduce some gameplay elements that improve the traditional visual novel formula but ultimately the game is too short to make it a memorable or meaningful experience."

,Recommended,313020,21710882,"Posted: 8 March, 2016",all,stardustsunday,"OverviewThis is a visual novel where you get to make choices throughout the story that affect what happens next and possibly the final outcome as well. At the start of the game, you can assign ""points"" to your character's assets (e.g. +3 health, +1 intellect, +0 charisma, etc) which affect what options are available to your character when dealing with situations that arise.ProsHigh quality feel- Well-made, aside from some poor language and editing at times.Good story- Has drama, excitement and is intriguing.Interesting characters- BONUS: And you get to sleep with some of them.Great artwork- Comic-book style, with rich, vivid colours and wonderfully-drawn background environments.Good flow- No matter whether choice A, B, C, D or whatever is made, the plot and narrative still proceed smoothly.Multiple endings- I found it worthwhile to play the game a few times over to get all of them. You get different cutscenes.Assignable assets- Found it refreshing that you can choose how smart, strong, charismatic & manipulative you want your character to be.ConsNumerous linguistic errors- E.g. ""Fuss"" is spelled as ""fuzz"", ""charisma"" as ""charism"", etc; and there are several instances of bad grammar or vocabulary. It gets grating after some time and demeans the overall quality of the game.No nudity- There is sex and characters explicitlytalk aboutit. There's even a bathroom ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. So let's have accompanying visuals alright? With themes such as those dealt with in this game (like drugs for instance even), this was never meant for kids in the first place!Really short- Playing the game once through it took me 30 minutes or so.Quite a few choices lead to the same outcome- You can choose A, B or C and what happens next is still the same. Same text and character responses.Loses its charm after the first play- Once you've played the game once through, you will know what it's about and how things end. So all other plays are simply to unlock achievements or cutscenes.SummaryA very short experience, but a nice one nonetheless. Liked the artwork and presentation a lot, and the music was very fitting and at times atmospheric, helping to increase the sense of immersion. I enjoyed it, but due to the short playtime, cannot justify spending more than perhaps US$1 for this."

I bought this because it was on sale for like 50 cents or something and had been curious about the genre for a while.It's sort of an illustrated choose your own adventure. It is exactly as the title implies, you have to make decisions, and for certain decisions, you forfeit part of your soul. Sometimes it works out, other times it doesn't, or so I assume, otherwise this would be a terrible game and story if you said ""No"" to everything and that was the only way to have something good happen.From what I gather, it's basically a beautiful Jessica Rabbit looking devil trying to trick you into selling your soul. Unless something good comes from the soul gamble, I kind of fear that the entire game will just be you selling your soul, having bad outcomes and then the end. But I obviously have not complete the game yet, so I'm sure there is a better way to win than just going with the ""boring"" choice.It's well drawn, although not my particular taste in art, I cannot deny the artists technical ability. However, the drawings lack soul. They're great drawings, but they don't really feel like ART.Maybe I'm seeing this through the specs of witnessing a new genre, and it really isn't as good as I think. One thing is for certain, this game has officially hooked my interest in the genre. I'd love to play similar games, however, unfortunately teh only ones I have seen are all anime dating simulators, and while I don't have an issue with anime (I actually quite enjoyed a few of them) I don't want to play a dating simulator. So if anyone reads this, and can recommend a good game in the genre, I'd appreciate it.Now, the reason I recommend this game? It's cheap. You can relax on your couch or bed (assuming you have a wireless mouse), read the story and click your choices.However one thing makes no sense, considering you're literally choosing answers from multiple choices, is that there is no controller support. Literally all they would have to do is allow you you to use UP, DOWN, and ONE face button to select your choice. Kind of stupid that they didn't include it.But I definitely recommend it. For it's low price, it's worth getting a couple of hours of enjoyment. Too many people expect to get 3000 hours out of a video game that costs less than the price of a movie ticket, and that's just silly. So buy it. You could get this for what you'd pay to buy a candy bar."

Faust is a young man who is suddenly faced with the possibility of turning his boring life around by making some shady deals off his soul. It may not be the story of the year, but it is well told and kept interesting throughout the game.Characters:Faust, contrary to some main characters I've had the displeasure to withstand, is likable and amusing. All the other characters such as the Guide (the red head), Peg and especially the green eyed man are brought to life with very interesting and obviously well thought out designs. Dimension and detail was given to the characters without overdoing it - and both their dialogues and reactions were made believable as well.Visuals:This game, as seen on the screenshots, has a very nice (and well done) cartoonish style to it. The backgrounds are full of detail and the style adopted is a likeable one - plus the ""dark reality"" is very interesting on the details too. The downside, however, is that, near the very end, the characters seem rushedly drawn.Gameplay:Your choices alter your consequences - and that's the core mechanic of the game. I felt a little bit of an unbalance here, since most choices lead to seeing the same things. The ending might change, but what you have to go through is very similar in all of them.Achievements:Annoying to get as all end achievements need a replay to get. Saving the game file and then reloading on crucial points has to be done manually if one doesn't want to play the game 5 times or so.Artbook & Soundtrack:As an artist, I found the artbook definitely worth it. The soundtrack, however, is actuallyannoyingto listen to once you've played the game one so many times as myself.Extra info:* The game can be beaten withinone hour, but all the achievements require more time (I'd wager some3 hoursor so).* This game hastrading cards(the downside is that, since they only spawn from 2hrs on, by the time you beat the game you won't have a single card yet).* This game is also available in Br-PT (although, being Brazilian myself, I felt the ENG was a more pleasant read).obs:I bought the Dark Arts edition of the game (that includes artwork and soundtrack) on a sale."

There is a fluid story, good graphics and multiple endings.I would pay $2.99 for this game easy.Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

Albeit if you're savvy, it is quite obvious what you must not do in the game.The story has a lot of potential as it empathises the amount of 'choice' you have in it regarding how you sell Faust's soul and how much you can influence the story.However I say potential because at times it feels lacking, Faust ultimately has to go through some of the same scenarios no matter what you choose and your options on what Faust sells his soul for are limited. It would be nice if there were more diverges in the story-route and unfortunately there are no game overs as you play through. (Unless you count the bad endings as such)The art has a comic-book style which is nice to look at and the soundtrack was fitting.The game has good replayability if you want to get the achievements and see the multiple endings but progress is slowed because there is no option to skip and you can't save the game and reload at specific points. For example at the final choices, once you complete a cycle of the game you have to start from the beginning instead of reloading and seeing the ending the other choice gives you.However, whilst I'm critical of the game, it is still good and is worth a couple of hours. For the price it is worth it and you can also wait for a sale and then the price of the game is basically a steal."

Well, you're forced to accept the offer in the end anyway.Apart from that, you're given plenty of choices that will change how the story plays out from beginning to end.The story is pretty intriguing, but short and sweet. A single playthrough would last about an hour or less, depending on your reading & clicking skills. Enough and worthwhile, at least, with the current $0.34 the game is priced at."

It grabs an interesting idea and develops it, creating an enjoyable story and experience all around. The idea is that, by making a certain pact, you can sell tiny bits of your soul in order to fulfil certain desires one might have. Ence the name, Soul Gambler. However, by decreasing your soul, the person will feel less and less human, and by reaching 0% he or she will simply become empty inside, unmoving and depressed.Choice making also affects the outcome of several actions, something that makes the player want to replay the game a few more times. This is positive due to the low playtime this title offers. Also, the background music could be better. Sometimes it doesn't actually fit what's happening throughout the game.The story of Faust and his misadventures with soul gambling are compelling and I ended up completing my first playthrough in one sitting.The art design utilized in this title is satisfying and I have no complains about it. Overall, I have no complains about Soul Gambler, besides the short playtime, which is balanced by the high replayability value.Conclusion: Certainly a nice addition to any gamer's library. The exploration of soul gambling is original and makes the player interested in the overall story and in the different outcomes possible to achieve. One of the best visual novels I've played as of yet!Recommended achievement guide:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=422324989Screenshot:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=515487589"

The music is not good, however, and beyond being simply repetitious and uninspired, it does not cleanly loop and digital clipping is audible upon said looping.The story is the primary focus of the game here, and it is really pretty solid. The sheer number of choices the player has to make will guarantee the need to replay the game multiple times to see all possible storylines and locations. A first run of the game will take an hour or so, and depending how into the game you are, that time may double or triple as you explore other choices. The game actually tracks what percentage of it you have seen, so you can gauge how much is left for you to hunt down.If you can catch this game on sale (I got it for $0.29), I'd recommend it. It has achievements and cards, and if you sell your cards you can almost recoup the cost of the game in its entirety."

The first thing is that, if you are looking for a ""choose your own aventure"" type of game/VN, then this is really a bad one for you, because the game is not making any effort to let you identify yourself as the main character. It doesn't give you the amount of choices and freedom to feel & empathize with your character.On the other hand... the game do tell an interesting story. The lack of choices and freedom are somewhat justified and understandable once we finish the game and get the ""moral of the story"". However, it is sad that the story is not more developed, and lots of potential are unexploited...I would recommend this game to lovers of VN who crave for a decent title.

So the game is short. But I just wanted keep on going. I really liked it. I wish that it was longer. On my save it actually says that I have only concluded 37%. But what happens when you get to the end is that you are able to continue from the start of the game again. So that percentage value from what I can gather isn't so how far you have gotten through the game but of all the different options you could have taken what percentage of them you have made. But I don't want to go through all the same scenes again just so I can raise that number. I liked original path that I took and I played that I wanted to play.First impressions:I've played the game for about 35 minutes so far. Out of the four games I looked at today it was easily the most fun.(optional let's play footage)http://youtu.be/QSoMEGHIDN4The game look's pretty good. When it says graphic novel it really means it. There doesn't seem to any animation at all. I like it. The gameplay relies heavily on the dialogue which have to read.Starting off you actually get to choose the protagonist's attributes i.e. level of physical strength, intelligence, charisma and so on. These determine the success of certain actions e.g. you need adequate strength to fend off a brute or good charisma to get information from characters. As the game progresses you are presented with various situations where you are tempted to sell your soul in exchange to manipulate reality in a way that benefits you. You start with 100% soul and the price for changing reality is offered as a percentage usually 10%.I like how can you customize the attributes of your character. You can't make them all high. I think it adds to the variety of gameplay and potentially the replayability of the game. You can be a physically weak person who is adapt at manipulating people or someone who is average in most areas but really tough (this is what I chose). Not being very charismatic I sucked at convincing people to provide information to assist with an investigation but because of my strength I was able to fend off a thug. The game is all about making choices, do I sell my soul for this or that, do I skip a day at work to or track someone down, do I cooperate with this person. Your life seems to be manipulated those who want you sell your soul in order to tempt you to do so. For example after refusing to sell your soul you conveniently fall very ill and come close to dying. You are offered to be healed in exchange for a fraction of your soul. However if you continue to refuse you eventually make a full recovery mysteriously. I stubbornly refused to sell any of my soul at all. The way some offers are made to you kind are sort of reminiscent of receiving phone calls from telemarketers 'for just 10% of your soul you can turn your boss into a camel' lol. I enjoyed just saying no to every offer. I really felt engaged in the narrative. You don't who to trust, who is really good or whether someone apparently trustworthy really has ulterior motives.So far I would definitely recommend this game. One of the things I liked most about it was that no matter what you always seem to have the option to stubbornly refuse to sell any of your soul. I was even able to not skip going to work and agreeing to work late at a job which my character hated and thought was completely boring. So basically I played a stubborn boring character lolClickherefor more let’s play videos =)"

I spent like 20-30 minutes and get the story to the end. Saying that I was disappointed is like saying nothing. Really, I walk my dog (in both meanings) longer than completing ""Soul Gambler"". It should be longer, a little at least.Second: you cannot skip dialogues. So if you want to have 100% achievements - once again, rethink, because you'll end with 3 hours of clicking. And while clicking isn't that bad in clicker games... well, other visual novels rather have that option - guess why? So the player won't get stuck with the lines he read already few times.Third: the story is lame. Seriously. I'm a big fan of Faustian myth - starting from the short stories from 15 century to Goethe's masterpiece and then to contemporary literature and movies that cover many interpretations of the same story of Faust. And to be clear: I don't expect the game (that cheap at least) to have complex, wonderful plot just like writers decades ago. But I expect it to have at least decent story, decent writing and characters that will have my heart. In the end, it's a visual novel and that genre is ALL ABOUT STORY. And this one is... bland. It just takes few trite motives connected to word ""devil"", mix it without understanding and voila! You have a pact, some of 666 here and there, ridiculous rituals and bam! you're done with the story, leave it idle for cards.Fourth:  the ending. Except being lame and devil-may-care, it's basically always the same. Minor things changes depending on your choices, but you will always see the same scenes, the same dialogues, nothing will surprise you. So, if you're looking for the game where you can create a story from beginning till the end and where CHOICES MATTER, sorry, but it's not the game you're looking for.To be honest, I really wanted to like this game.

It might even be worth the full $3!So you play some shmoe who gains the ability to sell parts of his soul for supernatural favors. The art is a nice comic book look that's better than all of the bargain bin visual novels on Steam. You have an icon showing how much of your soul you have left, and 4 stats.Asweome! This is going to be a nifty time/resource management sim with a neat storytelling twist, right?Nope not really. The stats barely come into play. As far as I can tell they just alter dialog choices. If you fail a stat check trying to do something, you just end up accomplishing it some other way.So you manage your soul stat, right?Again, not really. The main problem is, the ""tempting"" offers to sell your soul are just lame. You would think offers to sell your soul would involve becoming a rock star, famous actor, superstar athlete, or billionaire. So what are the offers in the game? Sell a chunk of your soul to finish a night's worth of paperwork at your dead end job? Make a bus arrive a couple minutes early? Find out someone's apartment number? I'm not joking the majority of soul selling offers are that lame. The closest any comes to tempting is 15% of your soul to bang a tatted up hipster chick you meet at a bar. Satan, dude, she aint THAT hot! You almost expect to come across Homer Simpson selling his entire soul for a donut...It's still an amusing hour to spend for a buck. It's just a shame the story is so short, linear, and the faustian bargains are so lame that they couldn't tempt squat. This game would have been a lot better off ditching the linear story (which ends before it even gets going) and going for more of a dating sim time/stat management deal, selling chunks of your soul to cheat the system. There is some definite creative talent going on with the developer, and it's worth keeping an eye on them for future games."

Every point in the game where you sell your soul is optional however it can be extremely useful at points. Plus all of the offers are tempting to take on. When you pick your attributes it seems like the limited number of points would be a downside but the point system only takes one or two points to turn the tides on a check. I do have to say though that the ending I got (the best one on my first playthrough) left me wanting more, hoping there'd be more to the story, which left me disappointed when there was no more. all in all though, this game is great if you find it on a sale like I did its definitely worth it.  8/10"

It has re-playability value too. The story is well written and I could not stop playing just to see what my choices would do and see what happened next.This game made me think about things. Deep things. Suicide. Soul Mates. Having depression all my life, it had a really different take on suicide I never thought of before. I've been with my Soul Mate for over 7 years, but it posed the question about having more than one Soul Mate? Possible? I think so now. But I love my girl and am happy, and that's all I need. But there might be more out there somewhere.Got this game off of a coupon making a badge, best coupon game ever! I couldn't believe how good of a game it was.

It also does it with a very COOL ARTSTYLE. I would have liked more work on the replayability, or the music, or a wider number of animations of characters and scenarios. But these little lacks do not minimize the FEELING of power and emptiness for selling your soul. This game is suggestive: it is able to connect you with your inner side and guides you through a travel with multiple endings to discover something new every time.As I have said, this game is great, BUT you may feel a bit disappointed if you don't buy it with a great DISCOUNT, because the game is great the first time you play it, but you will finish it in no more than two hours, and the second time you play it, the game will be losing its interest due to a LOW REPLAYABILITY."

While the choices are few, it does give SG some replayability if you want to see all the options.  The premise is interesting.  You play an ""everyman"" who is stuck in a boring job and social life.  Early in the game you are approached by a mysterious woman who offers you a deal to make your life more interesting.  Suffice it to say you don't have much choice, and from there you are presented with a series of scenarios where you can choose to expend a portion of your soul in order to influence the outcome favorably.  You don't have unlimited soul ""points"", and this is where the gambling part comes in.  You can elect to spend the points or not, but there are consequences either way.  The goal of the game is to uncover the true identity of the old lady and figure out why you were selected for the ""deal"".The graphics are very clean and cartoonish, but not in a silly way.  The game takes itself seriously for the most part, and some of the decisions you make have serious consequences.  The sound is good, and for the most part the dialogue is well done.As I mentioned there is some replayability in that you can re-load a save to see what the other choices bring.  This is definitely one of the better visual novels I have experienced in that I actually finished it (it's not overly long).  The ending seemed a bit abrupt, but it does have an actual conclusion.  If you enjoy visual novels with some meaningful choices then you may enjoy Soul Gambler."

I dropped a few cents on it just because, and it turned out to be more than I expected. The story is very intriguing, not boring at all, and I found myself clamoring to know which ending I would get (there are multiple endings). Every choice you make in the game determines how things play out later on. It is also important how you distribute your character points at the very beginning - this makes some decisions suceed and others fail.The art style is smooth and simple but nice. I never got tired of it. The music loops, but not flawlessly, and if you take your time reading you can tell when it starts over again. There are a couple of dialogues where the grammar isn't perfect, but it didn't take away from the experience at all. The achievements aren't too difficult to get, however there are a few where a very specific scenario is necessary to  achieve them. It took me several playthroughs to get all of them. A general tip: if you're going for the achievements, save periodically; this way if you mess up you can quit without saving and start right before you made the wrong decision. Saves some time since you won't have to play through the entire thing again.Like I said before, I got this game for a few cents, but I think it's worth it at full price ($2.99). The concept of gambling part of your soul to make things easier in your (Faust's) life is unique, you don't really see that in other games, especially visual novels. As of right now this is the best visual novel I've ever played.Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is even remotely interested in the story, or to someone who likes visual novels in general. I only wish it was longer. 9.5/10"

Using a simple mouse click, traverse the comic and choose your path of what do your sell your sell for? and gain character stats like Health, Manipulation, Intellagence and Charism. These stats do let you do specific things in the story if you have enough of them. Its a ''game'' changer for sure so pick wisely. The music is alright and there is actual background sounds for the scenes. ''It sounds like an office when you are at work ''.

Then there's the issue of the main character being told by a hot demonic chick to stalk his perfect ""soulmate"" (one of many, we're told); and then offered 15% of his soul to convince her to join him when he refuses to force her to date him.Kinda messed up.It's worth a quick read (under two hours) if you find it on sale (at least 50% off or more)."

The plot was interesting, the writing was good, the graphics/animation and music were good as well. My only real complaint is you are basically given unlimted power, but you are never given the chance to use it, outside of mundane things like ""would you like to use your power to make your work day shorter?"". At one point, someone states you have the power to do things like turn your evil boss into a camel. Why sure, let's do that. But no, that's not a choice you are given.

But as you go for more achivements you begin to realize the flaws within Soul Gambler. Now I only consider these flaws since I've played a few Japanese visual novels, and elements from those games are missing here.I can't really think of many GOOD points for this game.-Art is good.-Music is okay and fits the atmosphere just fine.-It's short.What I didn't like about Soul Gambler. (BAD)a-Some decisions didn't really matter.b-The mouse is the only way to prgress.c-No skip feature.d-Autosavea-The choices feel like a forest path you can't stray away from. Occasionally there are two paths, one will take you out of the forest, the other path will lead into the first out of the forest... why?b-Since there's no way to skip text you're constantly clicking and there's no keyboard function as an alternate control. (a feature strangely missing)c- Skipping text feels slow since it transitions to each frame by fading, so clicking faster doesn't matter. There is also no feature that skips already read text. (a feature commonly seen in current visual novels.)d-Now this is the worst. Autosave can make or break games, and you DON'T, put Autosave in a visual novel. If you wanted to see what the other route looked like, you had to play through the whole thing again because it Autosaves at every chapter. It also doesn't help that you can't restart the savestate to the begining without losing your save file. So if you started with stats you're unhappy with, well too bad, either start on another file or finish the game again.Wrap It Up!Playing through the game normally and naturally is fine. Achivement hunting is when the game starts to stagger and fall short of expectations. Now from what I feel the developers were aiming for more of an adventure feel, but it in a visual novel format it becomes too story heavy and there isn't enough weight to throw around. It also feels like their first visual novel so I'm criticizing this too hard. Now I know I went over the bad points a little too much, but Soul Gambler does have it's charms as it is one of the few Visual Novels I've enjoyed that wasn't from Japan.Too long?Just buy it if you're looking for something to just pick up and enjoy."

Yeah, I`ve got different endings only twice, but there are also lots of opportunities to finish the game in the other ways. Let`s review its all advantages and disadvantages.Firstly, the story of the remaked poem is interesting and full of different unexpectable moments. Most of decisions can be well-done depending on chosen skills of Faust. Anyway, it was fun and improved quality of my emotions about playing.I must admit that it`s good to build your own version of Faust, and for discovering his character it`s better to finish game a lot.Secondly, don`t be afraid of wasting some power of the soul for making wishes come true. The first time I made this mistake, but the second time I was more hedonistic.Frankly speaking, there are some disadvanteges, which are important to be written there.The game is only for an hour. If you are not liker of such short type of games, it will be better not to download Soul Gambler. Personally I don`t see this like a con.Your modern young man Faust has his own personality, and sometimes you have only to read his dialogues with others without chances to do a choice.So, I want to give a mark for this product.

But as with any visual novel with multiple endings, you do have to play through multiple times to see all parts of the story (and get all the achievements.)

I do find the game pretty boring alot of the time. It reminds me of one of those web browser flash games. Based on finding romance or trying to get the correct plot option. These games get broing really fast because there is not much in terms of gameplay. I found myself really bored at times skipping through most of the text to pick an option. Some of the character designs were pretty cool but some were just creepy. I think if the characters had voices I think that could have made the game more interesting or if you were able to actually explore. This game is a lot like a choose your path book. a comic book. with music and next to no gameplay. Luckily I got this game super cheap it was short. Short enough to experience it and gather an opinion. I will say its fun if you wanna see options and kill some time. But thats all there is to it. Very cool artstyle.

I'll talk first about the good stuff: the story, the choices you can make, and the art. The music wasn't bad, but it didn't catch my attention either. Now for the negative points: The game is too short, even for it's price. And i know that you can replay the game many times with different choices, but here's the main problem: there aren't many choices that feel really different. Apart from the 5 possible endings, there are less than 10 meaningful choices in the entire game, most of them just to affect the ending you get. All the others are basically a change in dialog. And even different paths have the same outcome. For example, there's a part where you go to jail. Before that, there are at least 4 choices, each seemingly different. But you'll always end up in jail. And replaying the same parts over and over isn't fun. The game isn't terrible, but i think the choices in the game are disappointing, considering that's the only replay value here. And it will get worst with each replay. If you want the game for the story and don't mind a short game, then you're okay. Otherwise, you can try it on sale. But be warned."

In this instance it's really a case of getting what you pay for, and when you take into account that the game comes with Steam trading cards, the amount of money you have lost is even less again. But, since I'm not one to simply give a game the red thumb without at least a little bit of an explanation, I'll tell you why I wouldn't buy this game if I had my time over.Mostly, it's the terrible English translation that ruins Soul Gambler for me. I suspect that if you played this game in Portuguese it would be MUCH better, but I'm afraid that if you're going to make a game that is essentially based on text, the text needs to be gramatically correct no matter what language you release it in. It's a major deal breaker. Whether you pay 50c or $15, what you're reading needs to make sense, otherwise any and all immersion is killed. It's a shame too, because Soul Gambler actually has a good story for the most part. There are some pretty heavy undertones despite the colourful comic-style art, and there were a couple of moments where I was genuinely surprised by the severe outcomes of my nonchalant decisions. In fact, the adult nature of the story was the only thing that made me play through Soul Gambler more than once, but unfortunately the more obscure my choices became the less the translations retained any semblance of the English language.Soul Gambler can be quite a short game if you don't want to give up any part of your soul. In my first playthrough I refused to give up even a single scrap of my soul, and it felt as though the writers almost resented me for it, with the game finishing in less than an hour. I thought I'd be rewarded for having the will power of a Tibetan Yogi, but it turns out that if you play more like a Tattslotto winner from Melton, there's actually a lot more content to enjoy. It's lucky that I wanted to see if there were other ""soulmates"" to discover in the game, or I would have been far more disappointed by what I assumed was the main storyline.On the upside however, the comic-style artwork is endearing and actually reminded me of some of the great games I played on floppy disk as a kid (but have long-since forgotten the names of). Soul Gambler certainly isn't so bad as to put me off this type of story adventure, but I'll certainly be a little more discerning next time I buy a game that's under a dollar."

There is also a delay after a new text box pops up, before you can manually skip to the next piece of text.This results in one mashing the mouse button over and over to get to the new parts of the story. Combined with the delay it makes any playthrough after the first 30 minute one a chore.The game itself isn't that amazing to begin with.

Faust has always lived a boring life, until the day he made the Pact that allowed him to make wishes using part of his soul.Pros: The game is drawn in a comic-book fashion with a peculiar take on the visual style that give it a gloomy, but not too dark atmosphere. You are regularly confronted with a variety of choices that may or may not succeed based on your stats, most of which open entire branching paths that change the story, allowing you to play through it again to try different thingsCons: The game is terribly short, and within a few hours you'll have tried every single different paths. The writing isn't all that great, and although there are multiple options, you remain limited within the confines of the game, most likely that the choices will all bring you to the same result.Verdict: ★★☆☆☆ - Forget itThe story had me intrigued, but not interested.

,Not Recommended,313020,17355630,"Posted: 2 August, 2015",all,PhineasPoe,"TL,DR: If you can get past the very awkward translation and don't mind that your choices don't matter that much, Soul Gambler is not bad. It's cheap, the art is nicely done and it has an interesting concept. However, personally, the lack of some key visual novels features (bad save system, no skip option), the mediocre translation, the shortness of the game, the fact that a lot of your choices don't matter very much and flat characters make it difficult to recommend. However, it really comes down to how much regret you'll have over spending $3.-------------------------------------Soul Gambler is not a bad game, especially for the price. It's a somewhat unique entry in the visual novel genre (at least for what's on Steam) as it features Western-style art and is not a story about falling in love (eh. . .mostly) or going to school. You play a guy, you make a devil deal and get the ability to slice off bits of your soul to trade for things. Things don't go well, because of course they don't.The art is great, the premise interesting and the story is somewhat engaging. I found myself wondering what was happening at a few points. These are the good points of the game, the rest is not so good.The game is extremely short. This is nice if you like 100% games, but it really hurts a story-centric game. There's no time for any characters to get developed. For instance, your soul-mate. . .don't really know that much about her. Something bad can happen to your friend. It has no impact, because you've know him for about three minutes. All the mysteries of the plot never get time to really breathe. They're brought up and then revealed very quickly. The final reveal is just kind of, ""Oh, okay, that's what was going on, huh? All right."" The premise is never used to its full potential. Every thing is very self-contained. ""Hey, want to sell your soul for this? Yeah? Okay, moving on. Want to sell your soul for this?"" It'd be nice to see how more of our character's life is changing and being effected. To get to know people more. To really be intrigued by the plot.Choices do matter. . .kind of. Sometimes. Usually, they don't. There is two choices during the game that actually have an actual impact. Now, there are a couple choices at the very end that will change things, but, again, those do not come until the very end. Other than that, every other choice is just kind of for flavor. Another aspect of the game that's fairly under-utilized is your stats. There are times when they get used, but they feel very much like an after thought.The translation for this game is not great. It's not terrible, I've definitely seen worse, but there are a lot of typos and a lot of very awkward phrasing. Here are some examples: ""I'm gonna spend some time on my parents' town."" ""Confront Hog would be just stupid."" ""Ask for help to that witch."" It's not super distracting, unless you're like me and you're always on the look out for it. However, the stiff writing stands out. Characters speak very formally and often say things that make sense, but the phrasing is very weird. It's not a dealbreaker, but in a visual novel, the novel should be well polished.Finally, this has problems being a visual novel. There are two key features that are missing:1. A good save system- You cannot have multiple saves. There are multiple save slots, but while playing the game, you can only save in one of them. Also, when you finish the game it auto-saves and if you try to load it, you start a new game. So, if you want to see everything you are forced to go through the game multiple times. This made much worse because there is no skip option. Get ready to click a lot to get through it after you have the dialogue memorized.This has been a very long review for a very short game. A game that has a lot of problems, but is not that bad. Especially for $3."

It looks impressive up front--it has a nice graphical style, a neat concept, and throws a stat screen at you to make you feel like it'll have some RPGish elements. But like the worst of David Cage or Telltale, what ends up happening is a strictly railroaded plot where very few decisions have any major impact beyond, at most, a stat going up or down. The ending/s is based on a single ending choice combined, possibly, with a single stat value. Outside of that, there's little variation from scene to scene, with major story beats happening no matter how hard you try to derail the plot to something else. Add to that the dull, sometimes poorly translated narration and dialogue and the fact that there's no dialogue-skip option for subsequent playthroughs, and it adds up to a pretty disappointed visual novel experience."

Probably one of its strong points.+ Story seems to have some potential of being something good after exploring most of the choices the game offers.+ If you understand PT-BR, game's script is actually good compared to their English friend.- Looks fun to play after some minutes, not so great when you finish it for the first time. Game is simply too short.- Short game if you don't care about different endings. Takes like 20-60 minutes to end one gameplay depending on how fast and how much you spam your mouse.- Ending feels always wrong. My first ending made me ask where is Episode 2 of this game. A game from 2013.............. A few endings later and I still ask where is Episode 2.- There is a decent amount of replaybility value in it because of the different endings and choices but as soon as you end it once, you will want to skip the already played scenes and are left with very quick plays of ~20 minutes so what seemed good ends being a chore to kill curiosity or to get the achievements.- Stats feel pointless, they have no use in the game besides find out small bits of the story that even if you didn't know, wouldn't make any difference. What's the point of adding something like this to later do nothing special about it? There is only one situation where they actually matter and if you don't care about achievements... well, means zero.- Sound could be better even if the basics are there. It's really bland at times.- English looks odd at times (typos, poor choice of senteces since they look direct translations of PT-BR to ENG), something that should be one of the strong points in this type of games. It's decent enough to understand what's happening so it's somewhat ignorable if you don't care much about it but may bother some players.- Lots of anti-virus report their exe as an ID.Generic virus. It's a false positive but...It's not exactly terrible for its price but being so short when the plot was good enough to make a game of a decent size (it's basically the film Bedazzled, something that I, and many others, like a lot, which, for who doesn't know, is based on the amazing story of Faust) surely make it a weak game.There is potential in here, sure there is (it's one of those games that I like because of its art), but misses something to pull it from a game with potential to something bigger like Deponia so I can't recomend it."

,Not Recommended,313020,34454231,Posted: 24 August,all,Seaside,"To be honest, I can't recommend this game. I suppose I shouldn't have expected much from a game that's three bucks, but I've had many games for around the same price that was far more satisfying. The music is rather lacking (I could swear it's just one song, an uninteresting one at that) Visual novels are, at its essence, a story dressed up by the graphics, music, etc. The story of Soul Gambler is, to be blunt, subpar.There many grammar mistakes that will break your immersion (had you cared enough to really read it carefully). I didn't bother, the writing simply wasn't gripping enough to make the majority of the (unskippable, I might add) story worth rereading. Usually when a story is good, I won't notice the mistakes. Yet here, the problems are so obvious that they are hard to ignore. The writing is also so basic and blend that they couldn't help cover up those grammatical errors.Another thing I found fault with in this game is the many plot holes littered throughout the story. The rules of the world and the deal the main character makes is never specified. Understandable due to the circumstance, yes, but rather distracting and annoying when new information about the fundamental rules of the universe is still being discovered at the very end of the story. It's one thing for Faust not to know the reason for each character's action, it's quite another for him (and the player) to not know how or why any of the magical things happening works. The story doesn't really flow properly. Due to its shortness, all the plot points are rushed and given flimsy excuses. The romance is a sorry excuse for one if you can even consider it a romance. You are forced to accept Peg as your soulmate, supposedly one of your many, and that's it. It's weak and loses any flavor due to the simple dismissal that your love for her (and vice versa) is due to fate.Another downside to how short the story is is that none of the characters are remotely developed. All you know of each character is their basic (and very cliche) motivation. And even those are simply stated by each character, there isn't any discovery, any change. While Faust's change (or lack thereof) is understandably in your hands, the rest of the characters has neither the time nor the basis to be developed. The redhead, for one, has far more flushed out character and is interesting than Peg (your plot device of a soulmate). Yet even she falls flat due to the lack of a core or consistency throughout the novel.There are, however, some things that this game does really well. The artwork is quite nice. It's colorful, interesting and very consistent. It helps carry what is ultimately a boring story. The characters are easily recognizable. The backgrounds are nicely done. The choices you make have major consequences, which was a big plus. There are multiple ways to get through situations and checkpoints, which is quite nice and makes a lot of sense. Despite the linear storyline, you are made to feel (quite rightly) that your choices do matter and that what you do make the story change. Which, of course, still highlights painfully just how short this story is.OverallPro:Nice artInteresting premiseAbility to influence story and main character in an obvious and satisfying wayCon:Flimsy storyBad grammarBoring musicUnsatsifying plotVery very shortLack of options (no skipping, no lowing sound, etc)"

This has to be one of the few good non-anime visual novels.The story is a modern young adult take on Goethe's Faust and builds up very strong, with a complex plot and unanswered question, but will leave you with a false sense of a grand adventure that is inadvertedly cut short by the shoebox budgets of the game. Before you know it, you'll hit the wall of the story culmination and it will all wrap up in a multiple-ending finale.Soul Gambler's ""good ending"" is extremely easy to pull off, just use common sense and some financial responsibility (hehe!). The bad endings, they are worth it only to see how the game will bend itself to ridiculous plot twist just to keep you moving forward.The visuals and art style are great for a comic book and the simple ""choose your adventure"" stat mechanics work very well. Where Soul Gambler falls short is the music and the SFX department - music is repetitive, badly stiched together, and sound effects are atrocious! The sounds for choice selection and that dreaded gunshot feel taken straight from early 80s arcade. Whoever did the SFX, should have never been hired, or paid.Also, with the latest trend of achievement hunting through all possible options in the story, it would have made sense being able to speed up the dialogue. Unfortunately you can't do that so getting all achievement requires much significant portion of your soul."

Like I'm gullible and someone successfully pulled a fast one on me and is laughing their head off. That's what I think the designers of Soul Gambler are thinking now. Free will? Are you kidding me? I tried in one save to get as far away from the witch as possible, but she ended up forcing me to make a pact with the bloody demon!This game is incredibly linear. A lot of the same things- emphasis on A LOT- happen in each save. Sure, you may spend your soul on different things, or you may get out of situations differently, but the next scenes or consequences are always the same. And that really grinds my gears. I could ramble on about the free choice system and the strange ""RPG"" elements in it, but what about the actual game? Okay, here's a good simulation. Just put your finger on your mouse and click it. Over and over again for about thirty minutes. There's the game.Again, certain choices and moments in the story are enjoyable, but because it's a lot of the same stuff happening all the time, there's little incentive to go back. But go back I did about five times to find out every bloody secret this game had, and realized just how little the game actually had to offer. Besides the well-drawn scenery and poorly done sound (no voice actors, really? And why does the sound loop stop at the end for a moment before it begins?), it just isn't that immersive. I would've enjoyed it more if my actions had more consequences, or if the story had more variation. And this is a game with no voice actors and just drawings in its design! It'd be damn easy to make a whole new plot from decisions. But we have this. A crappily-put-together game. And, yes, I am bashing it a bit too hard. It does have good things in it. And I hope the developers learn from these errors in the game and make something so much better in the future. But as it stands, the best choose-your-own-adventure games that I've played so far are made by BioWare or TellTale."

The reason I feel the need to write a review is, while the premise of this game is a pretty good one and the art is kinda neat at times, I still feel like it's not up to standards. I think this was a flash game at some point, and it really shows; the production value is just too low.You can hear the music / background noise suddenly start again when it reaches the end of its loop.It runs at a fixed resolution, and it has no option to run windowed either, as far as I can tell, so basically if your monitor isn't 4:3 because you live in this century, you're gonna have those ugly black bars on either side no matter what.The dialogue is pretty terrible, which, for a game that is only a story with decision-based mechanics, would be bad enough - but it goes beyond just being bad, to the point where every other sentence has at least one grammar mistake in it. Not to mention, the dialogue is done in all caps so it might take a while to shake the feeling  that all these characters are yelling at each other constantly.Overall, I played this for two hours and all I got from it was ""man, Faust is a cool name""So basically, I'd say don't buy this."

The story is decent, but it feels like it was translated either in a hurry or by someone who has an incomplete grasp of English. Also, once you've gone through the story once, the variations are really pretty minor on subsequent playthroughs. None of the endings resonated with me. Achievement hunting is fun at first, but some are way to easy to miss and replaying the game is difficult because you can't skip text you've already seen, or even cycle through it quickly.

I honestly didn't really know what to expect other than the fact it was an interactive graphic novel and based on a play. Although it's based on Goethe’s Faust, I found the story rather cheesy and only mildly interesting. However I did love the many different choices and outcomes! It is probably one of the shortest games I have ever played, but I didn't mind that. I'm assuming that English is not the creator's first language because the grammar was awful during some scenes. I wish the game was a bit more interactive. The only thing you do the entire time is click your mouse which got annoying quickly.

You'll need less than an hour to finish it the first time...Low consequences... and when you discover on your second playthrough that your choices have little to no consequences on the story, either you will stop the game because you consider it's worth the time, or you'll rush as many playthrough as you can to grab all the achievements.Missed opportunity for a great gameThe game had everything in gameplay & world, but because of a short story and choices with low to no consequences, the characteristics system becomes useless as for the soul gambling. The two of them simply alter a little what information you get in your playthrough and some storytelling, but not the endings that are too close of each others and too bland. The ramifications in the story are too short, making the game deliver you one and single story. No alternative path or things like that since every actions in a certain time of the story will ends the same way.I played the demo first before buying the game. I finished the demo many times because I liked the concept delivered, but the game haven't given me enough. The demo is simply 1/3 (if not half) of the full game, and was good enough. The game simply doesn't offer multiple destiny for the character, even if the world is made like this doesn't mean the character's can't have choices with bigger consequences."

Get used to it. I mean, how can a game with such replay value NOT HAVE some kind of fast forward button?Still worth it.Now if you'll excuse me, I have more endings to explore."

It was unlike any other game I've played before.  It's more like a ""choose-your-own-adventure"" comic book than a video game, but there are also stats the character uses to help him out of situations.  For the price I paid for the game, well worth it.  The art is well done, the story line is pretty decent, and the length time from start to finish of the game is good.

Even though it is primarily a visual novel, it has a  lot of different unique elements that help keep it interesting. You get to pick 'stats' near the start based on a few questions and this changes how the story will progress(The Fate of Faust). Playing through the story different ways to get the achievements is pretty amusing.  It is fairly short but otherwise good. I'd love to see a sequel or something similar."

I generally prefer visual novels have fairly compact stories so it's less of a chore to explore the different branching paths. Soul Gambler has plenty of branching paths but they all end up at the same place. It also lacks the ""skip"" button most visual novels feature, allowing you to fast forward to the next choice with minimal clicking. So much clicking.The story is interesting and the comic book art style works well. There's a bit of stat-building at the beginning which influences dialog options and results sometimes, which is neat. Soul Gambler is not perfect but having gotten it for less than the cost of a soda, I'm quite happy."
