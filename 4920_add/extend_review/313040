One, this game has no apparant autosave feature after each level to hold your progress.  Another problem that is very annoying is the SHIFT key being used in this game to shoot.  Requiring your pinky to access the shift while walking and jumping was a serious mistake on the developers part and leaves the player with a huge disadvantage!  The levels can feel very repetitive as to each character being spammed in the world ever few feet from the character and it has no exact story line (Not saying all games have one or need one but this one sure could have had a storyline to make it better)!  You could say this game is very choppy and the enemy mob variety is very scarce.  The game is very short and honestly needs retouched.  This game can leave you raging because you can't make any progress and it very stubby with the key.  To add, it needs an options menu to bind shooting with a better key."

Still, paying two dollars for a game you get for free on your phone? ♥♥♥♥♥ please!It's good and all...but not original...enough...to be on Steam. Yes, I get it that you people wanted to share your iPhone/iPad app on Steam...but take money for something you can get for free on your phone? Seriously?Just for that it gets an 5/10. Graphics are okay. But now gameplay...Who the heck though moving right while spamming shift was ""okay""?That takes it down to a 3.Each level is unoriginal and repetitive, not to say frustrating. Also, no offense, music was kind of bad.I got this for 90% off...still kinda overpriced even though it was less than an euro.3.5/10 Would not reccomend. Could've tried better."

I didn't expect much from it having only paid 49 cents for it but it went above and beyond my very low expectations.Pros: Playing on Fantastic The voxel graphics were fairly nice but in reality without any expectations they were pretty shoddy.Gameplay was not challenging at all but very casual with simple controls.Cons: Ridiculous checkpoints, Easy levels, Easy boss battles, Rubbish story.For the pricetag just buy it to make up your game collection. Its what I did and its pretty worth it."

,Not Recommended,313040,33544059,Posted: 14 July,all,Verdantil,"Tags: PlatformerAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from LibraryTLDR: Its trashReview: No Xbox360 pad support. Same strech of background with the same trees reused constantly, character design for protag and foes dont make sense. You hav to shoot blue balls at countryside animals that fire back at you with lasers. The voxel thing brings nothing to the table, the implementation of it is minimal art direction. Jumping is very bouncy and fast. Targeting with blue balls is not possible just shoot forward, making the use of jump+attack even more frustrating to perform. Very generic and uninspired. Removed for declutter"

Don't get me wrong, I've spent my fair time playing it. Got pretty far, but everything that I've seen has a reoccuring theme. You run, jump over useless things that happen to be in your path, and spam the shoot button. Unlocking new guns makes it eventually to where you don't even have to repeatedly press the shoot button, you just hold it down. Yay, as if the game couldn't have gotten any more lazy. 7.5 hours is a fair time spent before giving up on finding a gem in the rough. Simply isn't worth the $0.80, or w/e i paid, much less 4.99 when it's not on sale."

But if you don't care about that you might like to give it a try for a laugh (a BIT of a laugh lol). Update: I tried playing through a bit more, I just found it hard to keep going. To be honest it is a pretty bland game. I quit when I got up to a bit were you have to jump between 2 enemies and it was impossible to avoid taking damage. I died and it was my last life after countless deaths trying to complete the same level...http://youtu.be/Wxqxw9b0rOgSurprisingly to actually move your character and stuff it feels okay, it's fluid your character doesn't doesn't become static when you attack and that sort of thing. On first booting up the I found games sound track and short story explanation amusing. It's actually a hard to avoid some enemy projectiles because of the their unpredictability and lack of fine control over your character. I found a good tactic is to just spam your weapon before enemy even scroll onto the screen. But that's a pretty lame way to play and the weapon noise would annoying. Truthfully I only played for 10 minutes or so, so far. But I've completed the first of 5 worlds in what felt like 5 minutes. At that rate it would take only 25 minutes to complete this game. Even at this low price it may not be good value for money. Also the music became pretty repetitive and it seemed to only be a short loop. Obviously that can become annoying. And lastly the weapon that you unlocked after the boss fight was only different from the first weapon in that it fired a different coloured projectile. That was kind of lame lol"

,Not Recommended,313040,19578136,"Posted: 8 December, 2015",all,The Watching Shadow,"First things first, I noticed I picked this game up back in Sept 2014 (yeah, finally bothered to finish it Dec 2015) when it was $4.99.  I got it for $0.99 due to a 80% discount and I see it's currently priced at $1.99.  I wish I had gotten this for less than a dollar, honestly.So...the whole point of this little game is a hunter's guns are stolen by various, er, animals (?) and he wants to get them back.  You start off with a single shot (semi-automatic? :P) gun that is fired by pressing the shift key.  Like a few other reviews state, you need to turn off sticky keys or else you'll have, um, issues.  The game itself is rather short overall as it has only 5 main levels.  Each level/world has 3 stages to it and each stage has a couple checkpoints.  Sounds straightforward right?  Well, your ""points"" if you want to call it that are pieces of meat you collect while killing the various animals and 100 pieces of meat = 1 continue after you lose your 3 lives...and boy did I need them in some places.The first level (a forest) is waaay too simple as it's nothing but move right, spam shift, kill things, get meat, and get to the boss (after the 3 stages).  From there you get a new gun (rapid fire by holding shift instead of spamming it).  Each main area gets progressively more...involved I guess with a bunch of awkward platforming to deal with.  I had more game overs (and time accumulated) that I was wanting because of some jumps were just really awkward to deal with.  Oh, and before I forget on a game over you have 3 choices - continue (using 100 meat to restart at current checkpoint), restart (at the beginning of the current stage), or main menu (to start at the 1st stage of a different level).  Yeah..you don't collect meat all that fast unless you bother to go back to a different level and farm meat (I didn't).I will say that I enjoyed the music in the game.  The last level (a beach level) had music that REALLY reminded me of the ship theme from Final Fantasy 1 (NES heh).  The music on the main menu was rather cute too so yeah, the music was good in this one.The voxel based graphics was an interesting take I will admit.  I guess it has a certain charm to it instead of actual pixel platformers (decided pixel being in the title).  A couple levels had a few...gimmicks towards the end of the last stage that were amusing to do once but annoying to have to do over and over and over...as they were right before the boss. -.-;  With the frustration had in the game though, the ending was rather...unstatisfying.  Oh well...So, if you like platformers (with guns) you MAY want to give it a try but ONLY if you can get it for less than a dollar (maybe 50 cents?).  It had a few fun moments but going to have say NOT recommended unless you get it for cheap and just want to waste a bit of time with it."
