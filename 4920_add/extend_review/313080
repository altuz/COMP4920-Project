This is more of a puzzle game than I anticipated, the maps are mazes to coordinate through and the goons perform a fairly simple function.  I think the game is very cool, and fun if you enjoy the puzzle, and buy into the dynamic of the heists... but if you're looking for a heist planning sim, this is not it."

However, there are some glaring issues.Firstly, this game could be SO much more. You could add extra features such as, selling hot goods, selling weaponsnotority rating, using the hideout etc. I'm hoping that they'll add these features in future updates.Secondly, I'm about ready to smash my PC with the amount of times this game crashes. I feel like I'm a kid playingNES again and my mom accidently pulled out the power cable, while I was on the final stage of Super Contra.There is no semblance of a save feature, during LONG missions and the game always crashes at the end of thepolice station mission.Please sort out these problems and add a little more depth to make this game epic."

Review is for v1.2.2Unstable.Crashes too often (Seems to be a memory leak. Perfomance gets worse the longer you play), especialy on the later levels that take longer to complete. Can't complete my current mission (3rd to last) as the game will crash before the mission can be completed. By design, you can't save durring missions. I'm ok with the lack of saving, but having to rush to try and finish a level before the game will crash, is not ok.Controls are bad.Opening/closing doors are a large source of frustration. Game uses swinging doors with physics. To open a door to a room, you have to walk in to the door and then in to the room to open the door all the way. Until the door swings out of your face, you can't see anything past the door.Closing a door when facing it is often a two step proccess. You click the door to close it, and it swings on to your goon. He then has to turn away and walk away from the door as it will push him in the back if he does't move quick enough or of another goon is too close and blocking his path. Once the goon has cleared the door jam, he can turn around to face the door to lock it. This process takes WAY TOO LONG to complete. Have fun doing this when you want to lock enemies in a room before they can rush the door, push it open and punch your goons silly.Due to the bad controls, you are required to use two or more goons to do what should be simple tasks for a single goon. One to close/lock the door, second or third to hold a gun on the enemy to delay them breaking control. Sure you can knock everyone out and drop them in the room you plan to lock them in. You end up having to do that anyway, but it feels forced as the other method is so bad.Pathing can be bad. Tell a goon to backup to move a small distance away from an enemy or anything actualy. Instead of turning and moving to that spot, they will try to move far away (often in to another room) and then loop back to the spot you told them to move to. It then turns in to move, cancel order, move again.General bad stuff you can find in this game.Hire goons based on their stats, yet once you hire them you can not see those stats again.Goons can be killed by gunfire (including your own). OK that's fine. Goons can be killed by melee attacks. These are the same attacks that only temporarily knock out the enemies. Can't revive your goons durring missions, nor can you carry them back to the hideout to be revived. They can be killed from being punched with bare fists. Not OK.Enemies can have melee weapons (baton) yet will not drop them when knocked out or killed.  Late game you find 1 brass kncukle. Whoopty-doo.Achievement to hire enough goons to reach a team of 6. What's the point when you can only bring 4 on any mission. Outside of that achievement, there is zero reason to have more than 4 goons at a time.Pro's.Sound and Art are nice.Edit: Went to double check the version of the game v1.2.1 or v1.2.2 and now it crashes on launch. Avoid this game."

Would be nice to have an ability to rewind a few seconds of gameplay to fix stupid errors you've made, on last levels it takes lots of time to reach target and becomes very frustrating when something stupid happens right before finishing level clearly, take Doorkickers as example.  Community maps will make this one a perfect game. Thanks devs, almost finished the game, would check it later, hope this will bring requested features and clear out bugs."

Not so much that it's not worth the purchase, I do still reccomend the game, but you do see that it's riddled with potential. For example, in the safehouse there's tool tips saying that in the future you'll be able to buy and manage your crew and equipment as well as various other cool stuff that makes the safehouse more than just a pre-map screen.It has crashed a couple of times but the heists are short enough that it didnt infuriate me.

The interface isn't quite as nice as other top down tactical games (e.g. Doorkickers). I hope the developers will keep working on it to make moving through doors and ordering around hostages feel a little more intuitive.The reason why I'm giving it a thumbs down is because this game still has game-breaking bugs that need to be sorted out, even though it is no longer in early access.The game is worth 15$ assuming you can buy it one sale, but 20$ feels a little steep considering the current state of the game.

Unfortunately the creators never really seemed to get past that part. The gameplay itself starts off as a complex 'stealth and steal' but quickly boils down to a game of 'Find the red key' and 'unlock the blue door'.Completing your 15th mission is a lot like completing your 5th. The only thing that changes are the sizes of your guns and the number of your crew. Don't get me wrong- I thought this game was a great idea. I just wish they had done more with it.

Once you figure out what you're supposed to be doing, this is one of the best heist games ever made, if not the best. The threat of violence always trumps violence, and stealth is to be preferred, if not always feasible. You control the crowds as well as you can, and if things go♥♥♥♥♥♥up, it turns into a smash-and-grab, trying to get out before the cops arrive and you end up in a firefight, which will at best be expensive (you're responsible for paying for ""cleanup"") and at worst devastating, with a party member dying. It's like a very slow-paced, straighter, prettier Hotline Miami, if Hotline Miami was about working your way from knocking over convenience stores to robbing Fort Knox. I haven't heard a ton of buzz about this, but it's been occupying my attention for short bursts for the past few weeks."

I suppose that micro-managing a robbery/heist wouldn't sound too exciting, but the very first time you walk out with that cash in hand (and no cops giving you a hard time), it gets you hooked.There are many different ways to complete each heist, but eventually it all boils down to busting through the front door with SMG's, Shotguns, and Rifles, and mowing down everyone, greatly hoping that you make it out with at least half the loot. OR, you could go the stealthy methodical route with silenced pistols and tranquilizer guns, taking down cameras and stuffing people into rooms. Each heist has their own way of making you think, with their own way of rewarding you by doing things by the book. Some heists you absolutely have to go in armed to the teeth, and some will brutally punish you for not sneaking your way in.The Soundtrack is simple and somewhat dynamic, but still does its job good. Makes the setting feel like a real 70's action flick.

Do you want to try to rob it? Then BEWARE, ADVENTURER ! BEWARE THE CONTROLS AND THE SLUGGISH MOVEMENT OF EVERYTHING ON THE SCREEN !The main problem is managing the actions you want to engage. Your goons are kinda like Sims, they can either do the right thing or completely fail just because of stupid behavior, like standing over a bag of money instead of grabbing it, disabling the ability to pick it up for smarter criminals of your crew.You may end up in ridiculous situations where you're in a hurry because your smash&grab went wrong and guards are trying to arrest you.Imagine the scene : You give N°1 the order to go and get the money. Same order for N°2. N°3 is asked to pick up a note and N°2 must keep a guard in control with a gun on his forehead. Here's what happens : N°1 & N°2 put the money in bags, the bags are now on the floor. N°3 doesnt pick-up the note, but instead, tries to open a door you don't have a key for. N°4 stays in front of the guard which is getting a little less intimidated every second.N°1 & N°2 are standing ON the bags but cannot pick em up because bloody garbage, N°3 is sad because the door won't open and N°4 dies because you couldn't manage to save the entire  kindergarten you're managing in this heist. Result : You rush on the screen to try to give correct commands to your characters, which move incredibly SLOWLY and sometimes do the wrong thing over and over.Concept is super cool, but the gameplay is clunky, frustrating and not so rewarding.Sorry Sharkpunch, but it's too much for me."

This is not a matter of skill but abysmal pathfinding (e.g. on some maps, the first time you click will send characters walking all over the map instead of going through an open door) and animation (when you order a goon to lock a door there is a 70% chance that he'll get stuck in a loop, shuffling trying to get close enough to the door)2) game mechanics are odd, and terribly explained - e.g. the tutorial teaches the player that you can hold people at gunpoint to control them, but fails to mention that this only works in the tutorial (after that, it takes at least TWO guns to control people; keep in mind that you only get a single gun at the start until you grind enough cash to buy more). Have fun figuring that out.3) game is unstable - in my experience, there is a 50% chance the game will crash when you finish a missionEdit to add: And now the game crashes every time I try to launch it.

Another main one is the controls, it is not to difficult to get used to, but the choice from blasting a hostage away or selecting him is just either Rmouse or Lmouse(so you'll accidently blow away civis like 70% of the time) even if you do press c and save his life by canceling command,the whole place will be alerted by your shots. Other then those two main problems, it's pretty flawless  (the AI path finding needs  little work but it could be a lot worse).

76561197993197707,Recommended,313080,16421044,"Posted: 15 June, 2015",all,ribbakylling,"A good game that with a little more effort could have been a great game. I've currently played 15 out of 20 maps.The good:- Good game mechanics. Hold up hostages, disabling camera feeds, line of sight, fog of war.- Nice graphics that combined with the music, suits the game very well.- Nice map design that combined with the game mechanics offers different approaches to reach your goals.- A lot of potential if the developers decides to improve the game or make a sequel.The bad:- The UI is lacking. Too easy to make mistakes- The AI is lacking. The NPC are too naive- The game is too easy.The ugly:- Others have experienced game crashes and I've sadly exprienced that a couple of times myself.- Some NPC are too (and unrealistically) trigger happy. The police chief at the impound started shooting my goons that had stood idle beside the van during the whole mission. He never saw the one goon that had been active and who also was the guy that ""unlocked"" the chief (I hid behind the door when I unlocked the southern door). I just ran outside and started shooting like a maniac. So that was police brutality at it's worst.As I said, this is a good game that could have been great. Even if the game mechanics is good, the game itself is just too easy. When you've gotten the basic and you have hired 1-2 more goons, found a guards uniform, you will, with a little patient, most likely run through most of the missions without much drama and no collateral damage. Basically, you send the guy in dress as a guard, and he will get you all the keys and cut of the camera feed without any problems. And then it is pretty much straight forward for the rest of your goons. You find yourself a room where you can lock off all exits (and make sure that it doesn't have a phone inside). And then you just ""invite"" one after another of the guards/civilians to that room.Much of the problems is that the NPC, especially the guards, are too naive. Other problems is that the guards don't try to fix the missing camera feeds.So what I would have liked to see regarding this is:- Guards try to fix the camera feeds. And if they cannot fix it, they become a lot more alert.- The guards communicate with each other for instance, via wire less (walkie talkie). So if the see something suspicious like a broken window, the call over other guards and they conduct a search. Also, they have com-checks now and again. So if you have lock guard A inside a room and guard B calls out for guard A and does not get an answerer, he will conduct a search.- More random behavior from NPC. For instance a guard get bored standing/patrolling, so I go to chat with colleague or goes to the kitchen to make a snack or go out for a smoke.- Different skill level on the guards. You can have one slacker who don't care if he saw something suspicious, others are extremely professional. And maybe having somebody that is completely paranoid.- random behavior when you hold up an NPC. For instance that some NPC can panic and try to run off.This is not part of the review, but more on how I would have liked to the game to be.I would have liked to see a more complex campaign where the police will investigate your heist. Basically, your goons can leave evidence during a heist which may increase the chances for the police to find you. For instance if you get caught on the camera, if you don't get the tape containing that recording, the police will know how your goon look like. NPC can become witnesses if they see your face. You can leave fingerprints at crime scene. So to counter this, you can wear masks and gloves. But using this when you are only gathering intel, it will increase the rate of suspicion by the NCP's. Also, there should be a notoritey level, so the more aggressive you are, the more public wants your arrest, and hence, more resources will be put into trying to solve who is behind these heites.Also it would have been fun if the game focused more on gathering intel before a heist. For instance you must have contacts to get the blueprint of buildings. Without these blueprint, the layout will be covered in the fog of war. Also you should be able to buy more intel, for instance how many guards there is at duty, how professional they and so on.And of course, it would have been cool having some RPG elements on your crew, learning skill and so on.And if all the above was include, it would the be put together with a sandbox career mode were you can include fan made maps to, and the ""plot"" is just to ""earn"" as much as you can until you either get caught or until you decide to retire. A little bit like Pirates. And this would also require a time-line where new technology becomes available both for you and the police (DNA for instance).And if you get caught, it would have been cool with a some prison break maps so you can arrange an earlier release. And if you don't decide to escape, you also can continue your career after you've served your time, if your health allows it.And what to do with the loot? Well, buy a lot of cool stuff, a mansion, a yacht and so on.Multiplayer would also be pretty awesome."

You.will.not.regret.it.When I played ""The Masterplan"" for the first time, it blew me away to what extent it was uncomparable to anything else I've experienced before. At first glance you might be intrigued to draw a reference to Hotline Miami and honestly, this is the best thing that could happen to this game. While it presents itself in a familiar, established style, the game-mechanics itself are so one-of-kind, that it just draws you into this form of - I call it - ""new"" nostalgia, being reminded in a pleasant way of various, well-recieved games, such as Payday 1+2, Doorbreakers with its similiar top-down view and pace, Monaco with its different classes but by far not as arcadish and thought-out and finally a stylish, fitting gore which is reminiscent of the gruesomeness from the legendary Hotline Miami (of course by far not the same amount). And then again, it's a game of its own, which utilizes these known gameplay-mechanics in a different manner.For me personally, the cherry on the cake, is the amount of choice it provides you with. You will always find yourself polishing your approach to a mission which fits your preference the best and honestly, if this game pulls off to show this many alternatives to finish a level on the small maps included in the Early Access, I can only imagine how far this will reach out when the game hits release.Sure, there isn't very much to do at the moment but to replay the same levels and I'd understand, if you want to wait for more updates before your purchase.Personally though, the developer had it easy to convince me. Subjectively: Hot favourite for the best indie game of this year.You might ask yourself: Why didn't you play it more then?My answer: I don't want to spoil it for me too hard - I will play every update, see what's new, how it handles.Hope that makes sense to you.

Then use two other robbers to stickup (lock them to the cop!) to escort your cop to the holding area and transfer custody to the door guards, before theyhead back out to get another cop.  When your getting ready to lock the cops in the room make sure to rob the cops first to steal their keys.Useful hints that sound a lot like complaints to even my own ears:If your trying to get your stick-up guy to do an alternate action like knock-out someone.... then be prepared to put away your gun first and get into a fist fight because pistol whipping doesn't exist.Take away a persons keys and lock them in a room.  They don't try to break down the door.  Ever.

The Masterplan is a game I really truly wanted to love. But… I just can’t… First off the game feels too half-baked for a game supposedly out of early access. Examples, why are there two lockpicks you can find on one level but no more anywhere else? Why can I not view my goons stats after I hire them? Why can't I buy a bigger car? Why after the final score is the only way of exiting back to the normal game to quit to the main menu? It in turn doesn’t save the game from that score so you can technically never fully finish the game. You will still get achieves for it however. And why oh why does the game crash so much? 30 out of my 50 hours spent on this game have been afk for the last 3 nights trying to get the, “It’s my dayjob” achievement seeing how it’s the last one I need to get only to find in the morning that the game had crashed when it didn’t even have to do anything other than just sit there. Finally, I am running windows 8.1 and have a GeForce GTX 750 Ti 2gb version and yet in full screen mode I only get 30 fps where in Battlefield 4 I get 80 fps that can drop to 40 when intense events are happening. That should not be the case at all for a top down game with such basic graphics.The good.This game did provide me with some 20 hours of entertainment and I ended up beating the whole game. In this time there were some pretty fun moments. For example, when I used explosives to blitzkrieg the bank and later perfected my technique to blitzkrieg the casino. It is also pretty satisfying to go through all the work to clear a level and make off with the loot walking through the stealthy (or loud) chaos you’re leaving behind. Some other fun moments consisted of, holding up around 15 guards with 2 goons while my other 2 rounded up everyone else on the level, having a level without cops or cleaner costs where I basically stormed in with Uzis and murdered everyone, making off with the 4mil from the final score. Despite not being able to keep it was still fun. These are some examples of the good times you can have while playing this game.Pros and ConsPros:Fun top down gameplay.Ability to hire and make a full sized crew.Satisfaction of perfecting a plan all the way through (as long as it doesn’t crash!)The ability to carry out a plan in such different ways really makes you wonder how you can approach each level.Pretty original idea.Cons:Frequent crashes.Low fps regardless of good graphics card.Half-baked unfinished features. (example lockpicks)Loud not a very practical option as you can lose up to 96% of your payout from cleaner costs alone.Can’t view goon stats after hiring!The game will never technically acknowledge you completed the final score outside of an achievement, but everything else for that score resets.TL:DR/SummaryAll in all this game is pretty fun at first providing a new and original idea. However, this game was yanked out of early access way to soon with too many unfinished features, and crashes to make it worth its $20 price tag.Recommended?No"

Some gameplay mechanics such as hostage system are fresh and very intresting and rewarding to use. Each heist lasts from 5-15 minutes on initial playthrough, and you cannot save during the heists. It adds to the tension, and I personally wasnt annoyed by the lack of mid heist saving or didnt find retrying a failed heist a chore. Usually the hardest parts of the heists are in the beginning of them as well, so you really dont need to be afraid of losing 15 minutes of time with every attempt.What is a shame though, that some minor errors plague the game, that make it frustrating for many I believe. What is even bigger shame is, that the developers could have fixed these issues very easily, if they just were willing to give up some of their ideas  (ie. just remove the friendly fire, since the AI is too stupid to make the mechanic work). The game also has a memory leak, and will crash after an hour or so of continuous play, so better quit and restart the game after each succeeded heist.Nevertheless, the game is still a fun tactical action/puzzle game for the ones  who can handle some small but irritating bugs in it. If you are a patient player and just take your time, they wont stop you getting a good experience from the game."

This view makes the environment you are robbing feel like an actual map as you can plot your movement from room to room while scanning the entire location.  The map/level design is the sort of addition that some may overlook as a basic visual style, but it really helps bring together some of the strategy needed to successfully complete a level without your fellow gang members dying.  The lighting is also a huge highlight ofThe Masterplan. As your characters creep around corners, you will see shadows of upcoming textures begin to reveal themselves. It helps round out a very solid environmental design.During your heists, you will find weapon fliers hidden throughout the building that you must pick up and bring back to your hideout in order to unlock the weapon for purchase. This makes sense, but it would be nice to purchase some of the weapons a bit earlier, such as the silenced pistol, which is incredibly useful and would have been great to have access to from the beginning of the game. Then again, using a weapon can lead to less money as you are charged a “cleanup” fee at the end of each mission that is based on how many people you killed, with one kill cutting your overall pay in half.When it comes to the members of your gang, permanent death is a thing to look out for. You can replace your goons by hiring more using the money you have acquired. The criminals you can hire will come with different weapons and varying statistics and specialties.With the huge selection of locations available, it is hard to find yourself tiring of robbing each and every location you come across. The levels become infinitely more entertaining when you figure out the perfect plan that sees you getting past every guard and squeezing out every dollar possible.The Masterplan’s in-heist gameplay is, without a doubt, the most frustrating part of the entire experience. While looking over the map and devising a plan is fun, it is tough to set that plan up perfectly due to the confounding controls. The controls are based all around the right and left mouse click, with the left selecting your goon and the right controlling pretty much everything else. At first, you catch yourself constantly trying to move with the left click. You can open up each character’s inventory by clicking on said character with the right click, which is also how you pick up items. Because of this, you will run into multiple situations that bring about a host of frustration as you struggle to tell your character you want to pick up the money in front of you as opposed to just opening up their inventory. Another incredibly frustrating aspect is when you are expected to perform a hold up on your enemy. In a perfect world, this would have you throwing your gun up at an enemy and them following your commands. But inThe Masterplan, you must keep your visual cone on the enemy or they will go crazy and call the cops. Doing so is much harder than it sounds, as you will find yourself needing to order enemies around to unlock doors they have the key to. Once you order them to unlock the door, they tend to move outside of your visual cone. Establishing constant sight on them feels next to impossible, as you must hold down right mouse button on your character to rotate where you aim. Being unable to use the right mouse button can lead to frustration, which can ultimately lead to your entire plan falling apart.THE GOOD- Welcoming art style- Lots of locations to rob, including a bank and arcade- Decent amount of goons up for hireTHE BAD- Frustrating inventory design- Would be nice to unlock certain weapons earlier- Clumsy controls7/10DISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY |GOOD| GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE"

Overall I definitely enjoyed it; pretty much played it nonstop since I bought it.There were a few minor things that I did not like though. One, it crashed quite often and when I was on the very last level on the very last part, it crashed, so I had to redo the whole entire level. Another thing, is the weapons pretty much suck overall. The only weapon I really used was the shotgun. Dont invest too must into weapons, rather invest into better goons. Finally, friendly fire is on and is not optionable, so whenever you got to stick people up or whatever, make sure you place your men strategically using the space bar. By strategically placing them in a room you make sure to avoid friendly fire if shooting must take place. This is definitely more of a stealth game than a shooting game. I, for one, avoided shooting at all cost because it is VERY expensive in the end.This is a fun game with minor problems. It is a bit of a puzzle and stealth game so it is fun and relaxing yet edge-of-your-seat fun. I recommend it for just about anyone."

You will forget about characters on larger maps, like the warehouse. There is no game play, just managing what is happening. Management with no action is not something I like in a game. It will be interesting for about 20 minutes before the grind starts to set in, and maybe an hour before you realize your just doing the same thing over and over too slowly to be rewarding. The crashing is going to happen eventually, alleviated some by disabling the Steam overlay, but will still happen.

I can play the same missions again and again many times, trying to see the differences of the consequences I have choosen =)But there are many missions (I think more on workshop, needs to check).PROS- Missions can be played many times and have different experiences- The way you buy weapons, unlock missions and in-mission paths is really nice and fun- In your base you can remember what is the gameplay, nice for newcomers- Each mission has different challenges and gameplay is evolving- You can hire criminals, buy weapons and grow your base. There is no other game like that that delivers this experience- Idea well implemented, well doneCONS- Crashes... I did not have many at early missions, but bigger missions tends to crash sometimes.- Basic stuff in games like this, like: checking your goons stats, is not available after you hire... I don't know why devs did not implement this.- The controls at the beginning may be challenging for some, because it is not the standard of handling weapons and attack. This is a minor issue I found myself. But the gameplay fits very well- Music is really repetitive some time, although is really nice (I will buy the soundtrack just to support the devs next month)- Some in-game actions needs more info, so you don't get lost when you first try your heist (this is fixed by yourself when playing again, but sometimes it ruins the experience of your first heist in a map ever) - but again, not a problem for me, it can be for some- Goons hit each other when shooting in front of each other - I think this is a game design feature, so, maybe not bad at all if you think bigDevs, I did not see too much of this game in game channels and media, please, try to explore more of this in a future game or this one. I know a lot of people that could enjoy this and don't know.Worth the price and the content inside the game, but there are crashes, be aware of that.I have a ""Transformer"" PC and, sometimes, the game lags when too many guards locked in rooms until crash (also, when police arrive, game crashes if there are too many guards).I will keep my positive review because I do hope it will get fixed and also it is a great game."

,Recommended,313080,16916522,"Posted: 6 July, 2015",all,COCAINE DINOSAUR,"For those that don't know, or are interested in buying;The Masterplan is a top down strategypuzzlegame. From appearance, it looks like a Payday: The Heist gone Door Kickers(but being the criminals) mixed with a crime-like aspect of Hotline Miami... with polished gameplay with many awesome features and unique and appealing graphics. There is a lot to this game and I'm going to try and cover most of it.When I first bought this game, I was dissapointed. The first mission is quite confusing to someone who has never seen gameplay or a video of how it's done and the game's version of a 'tutorial' is confusing and quite unhelpful. This, being a con. However because of easy controls and UI you will figure it out within a minute or so. After you complete missions you go back to your hideout, which, is mostly pointless other than for you to mail order yourself weapons and accessories, or to hire another goon (Hitman/robber/whatever you want to call it). The more goons the better. Once onto levels with security you will want to hire another goon and make sure two of your three goons have guns. It takes two guns pointed at guard(s) to make their resistance level stay at 0 (Full circle), while your third goon beats them up. The gameplay is quite fluid and there is no pause button, but there is slow motion which is essentially the same thing except that the game is still moving. (reaaaaally slowww)Due to the top down, slow paced aspect the game can probably run on any PC or laptop. The graphics aren't really changeable (Not like you would want/need to). And the game rarely crashes and doesn't ever crash on startup (for me, and I haven't seen any crash on startup reports on the forums). The developers and moderators on the forums, to those interested in the community, are very very nice. They seem to be open to critisism and are nice to the players and those asking questions on the forums. They reply to nearly every post, crash log, bug report, suggestion, etc etc.Lets talk about how the game does in its genres.Strategy 9/10. Very strategical, will have you dieing/running to your car from cops/shooting cops, picking places to hold people up, hide bodies, etc. Needs some working on the paths your goons follow but that is it.Action 5/10. Not in 5 as bad but 5 as in it depends how you play. If you are the other 50% you will refrain from any 'action' and only hold people up and knock them out. If you are the other 50% you will be seeing lots of action, like shooting at cops, security, civilians, running to your car before the police show up, etc. So it heavily depends on how you choose to play.Puzzle 4/10. Most people are probably suprised when I classified this as a Puzzle game, however, most players would agree. It's not really a puzzle game, it just has puzzle aspects of it. The whole mission is essentially a puzzle that you have to figure out how to get through a room and get the pieces inside of it using means of holding people up, telling hostages what to do, hiding bodies, locking doors and lots more. Since the game only has puzzle aspects, and isn't a puzzle game. So if you aren't into puzzle games, but this title has caught your eye, keep looking. If you are looking for puzzle games, this isn't one.Now, to other qualities of the game..Graphics 10/10. It has its own unique, and good looking style of graphics. Whereas, if you are looking for an HD clean realistic looking graphics, you won't find it here.Bugs/Glitches 7/10. The game has bugs/glitches but they are few and far between. Most that get reported get patched that same day/week.Gameplay 10/10. Challenging as hell, exciting, keeps you on the edge of your chair hoping you don't slip up and ruin your heist.This game is unique, fun, challenging, appealing, and very exciting. If nothing I covered in this interests you, check out more reviews, gameplays, to get a feel of the game. If you still aren't interested, I suggest you look for a different game.OVERALL:9/10"

,Recommended,313080,19992828,"Posted: 27 December, 2015",all,Kunovega,"Funny storyline, interesting setup. The gameplay is more of a puzzle/planning game with some very minor tactical elements. If you are looking for depth of action, look elsewhere.The downsides are really all in the mechanics though, a lot of the games difficulty comes from unresponsive controls and the clunky interface that doesn't do what you want it to do ""in the moment"", leaving you frustrated when one of your goons runs off and trys to circle around the building when what you wanted him to run over and do was directly in front of him but some stray box told him to go the long way.Also of interest is the metagame style used here where you evolve your crew and its tools between missions (or by going back and redoing missions to perfect them) which should in theory make every play through unique. Unfortunately there's not alot of depth to this either and the customization ends up coming down to generic thugs with random names and sometimes just redoing missions over again to get the money you need to finance a tool you need for the next mission.There's a lot to like in this clever little strategy/puzzle game, but it's also pretty unpolished and it's not terribly long. Unfortunately it also started to glitch and hiccup. During the pause screen (which is like a bullet time where you set up a series of moves) the game would often hiccup (pause within a pause) and not actually accept your input commands. And since its not actually stopping the action you get to watch in slow motion as your goons don't obey your detailed commands. (And than trying to reclick on the person you need when there's 5 of them overlapping to redo a command sequence that was multistepped is an excercise in frustration)...I wish I could write a glowing review for this game, the core elements are there it's just not quite perfected and it's probably never going to be.In the end I would still recomend the game but only on two conditions:1. you can tolerate some frustration in your puzzle interfaces2. get it on sale, I don't regret spending $5 on it, but I'd be pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off if I'd spent $20I'd kill for a less buggy version of the game or a ""pause while planning"" that isn't in glitchy slow motion, that would have been worth $20 instead of $5.Anyway if you played cops & robbers as a kid and were always the robbers, you'll probably find something to like in this game if you pick it up on sale."

,Not Recommended,313080,13201252,"Posted: 2 December, 2014",all,tajmone,"GOOD POTENTIAL, BUT TOO BUGGY FOR NOW! The game is quite nice, and it's developing around a good idea. Hopefully it will end up in a good final product. As for now, the main issue is constant crashes. In the last week there have been 2 consecutive updated (5.0 and 5.1) but for some (like me) it just meant that the game became unplayable because it crashes every time I choose to play a heist.Unfortunately, because Steam App handles all the updates automatically, I'll have to wait for the next update hoping (let's cross fingers) that it will work again. And updates are not all that often.So, if you are looking for a game to play, I advice you wait till the game is less buggy. If you are ok with bugs and just want to support the project, then give it a try.Regarding the game-play experience I have mixed feelings: I really like the game and the ""idea"" of how to conduct it; but I find that game controls are a bit clumbsy. Even though I've spent a good amount of hours playing it, I often end up stumbling while I try to put into action game strategies due to the difficoulties of having to control the characters with mouse and keyboard -- too many passages (clicks, menus, queued actions, ecc). At times I've found that frustration is more than fun during gameplay. Hopefully, this might change with future editions of The Masterplan, but it would require some rethinking of the user-interface/controls-implementation on the developers' side.Overall, it's a very original game and I really hope it will develop into a great final product. But I don't feel like advising to buy it at this stage -- at your own risk: you might be amongst the unlucky ones who end up always crashing!"

The learning curve i found to be actually pretty enjoyable, but ya half the time im screaming at my guys trying to figure out what idiotic thing they are up to now, but still a good time.  You basically are a full time armed robber and while there are only 19-20 different jobs from what i can tell, you can redo them over and over again and grind up cash to hire new guys and new weapons, and the levels themselves are done decently imo.It can be frustrating at times as the ai doesnt really listen to you and has a hard time walking around objects and other characters.  When it starts getting stuck he starts walking around in erractic patterns and will get out of range of the guy supposed to be covering him (and it takes about half a second to break) and the guy will take off running and call the cops.  Its far from perfect and some levels are flatout painful just to get people where you need them to go, but it could be worse and usually you can either bypass the specific issue plagueing you or you can try guns blazing.Will be better if they release some map making tools and mod support (kind of shocked it doesnt have this already), or would have been cooler if it was randomly (or even semi-randomly) generated levels but still pretty fun game."

,Not Recommended,313080,18089787,"Posted: 18 September, 2015",all,Blandman Bob,"Review update:Game is abandoned. Shark Punch, the creators behind this game, handed over the rights to some other company, which presumably from the fact their website doesn't work anymore, had shut down shortly after.The game was fairly decent, but the crashes were, and are still a problem.If the damn developers actually cared to have at least worked on this to make it a little more stable, it probably would've worked out to be a decent choice to buy.Trust me though, crashing at Fort Knox, towards the very, very end, was an absolute buzzkill.In a 'out of ten' rating system, I give this game a five. I would like to point out, while making the statement in regards to the Fort Knox deal, that the rating change is not out of experience bias revolving around that statement, and the rating is in fact going towards the overall events surrounding the game, and what has happened.Stay away from this game. If it were possible to do a personal review with the Valve team, to discuss the matters behind this, so that I may or may not be eligable for a refund, rather than base it on a flawed steam time system, I would so definitely take that, to get my money back.The game had good potential. But the workshop community is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke, and so are the morons who couldn't even maintain this game.If the game somehow becomes free temporarily in the future, feel free to give it a go, but if I were you dear reader, I would just stay far, far away.Original review (September 15th, 2015. Ihadrecommended it.):It's a pretty decent game. I like it a lot.The only issues I have with this game is THE FREAKING CRASHES! Seriously. It crashes a lot. Well, not a lot per se, but it crashes at the most unfortunate times. (Unrelated Note: Removing the Crash Dumper folder in the game's files delays these Crashes, but they still can happen at any possible time.)The other issue being that there is no save feature. Sure, it autosaves, but without a manual save option, you can't save on important setups and maps just for safety from these annoying crashes.All in all, this game still has bugs and issues, and it was sent out of Early Access a bit too Early.I recommend this, but I also recommend caution, and not playing it for a extensively long time, or else you'll be in tears.8.8/10Would Crash on (Spoilers?) Warehouse 9 Diamond Room again."

All planning occurs on the fly at the heist location, so don't expect to spend any time devising a meticulous plan and then executing it Rainbow6 (original) style.Still worth a buy though as, despite being a bit clunky, controlling your 'gang' to get the job done quietly and efficiently is fun.A great way to burn an hour or so."
