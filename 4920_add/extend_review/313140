This is a very good adventure game, well worth your time and money if you found yourself fascinated by the imagery and concept like I was. The story starts out simple, but as you progress it becomes clear there is more going on. The personality of the psychopath you play is quite amusing. Many objects in the game can be examined twice for humorous responses, and sometimes hints about what to do.There are 10 chapters in all with varying length. If you don't use a guide the game will take 6 hours or more to beat (about 7 for me). I've personally found no bugs or glitches. What sound there is is well done and in certain places adds to the tension, as does the music. The game will occasionally switch to 1st person and this is done very well and further adds to the tension (this is first done in chapter 3, and if it had stayed in birds-eye view that section would not have been as interesting).The meat of the game is indeed the puzzles. I admit I found myself stumped for awhile on several of them, but they are solvable without a guide. I did need a hint for one of them, and one particularly aggravating puzzle had me stumped for over 15 minutes. And this was just chapter 3! The puzzles continue to be challenging all the way to the end.My only complaints are the numerous spelling and grammar errors, and the lack of a save anywhere feature. Otherwise I had a blast! I therefore recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of adventure games and wants something bloody and freaky."

When you go in expecting roses, sometimes you get daisies and sometimes you get smacked in the face with a rotten tuna fish. Blackbay Asylum is like having both of those things at once.""Blackbay Asylum is a top-down/first person puzzle/horror game set at the eponymous Blackbay Asylum, which is located off the coast of Innsmouth, Massachusetts. For those who are unfamiliar, Innsmouth is a fictional city known for it’s relation to the HP Lovecraft mythos. In here, you play as Doug, a large and heavily muscled man who recently incarcerated at Blackbay for being a mass murdering sociopath.Gameplay in Blackbay Asylum generally consists of moving Doug through the level, collecting the equipment and knowledge to solve each puzzle as it pops up. Speaking of the game as a whole, the puzzler aspect is much stronger than the horror one. Although the first few chapters left me unimpressed, (if you can make sense of it then you can get through the first level within 10 minutes) it was probably designed that way to bring people into the game a lot more. The puzzles in the first level aren’t too difficult and they get you really immersed in the game and also makes you feel more intelligent than when you started. And it doesn’t take long for them to get genuinely tricky. Some of them have fairly simple gimmicks to work out before you can progress, but for the most part they’re cerebral enough to keep the old noggin’ working. Just like any good puzzler, the challenges you’re faced by start off fairly simple but ramp up the difficult as you go on.Characters in the game are rare to come by; a lot of the other people that you see in the game are dead, dying or will soon be dead (either by monsters hands or by you) but the people you do come across aren’t overly well written. For instance you come across a man who is hiding in a dumpster in the first level who sounds insane, ironically, and some of the things he says just seem a bit too wild even for an insane asylum. Also a receptionist at the front desk who is working and on her cell phone the whole time doesn’t seem to care when a giant man covered in blood walks from Isolation into the lobby which is a bit odd. That being said, it’s worth reminding you thatBlackbayis indeed a horror game. While the dialogue and descriptions are exceedingly silly, every aspect of the game is eerie.So, I’d played through the first two chapters of the game and then I landed in Chapter 3. The third Chapter of BBA is almost flawless. It is genuine horror, perfectly executed. The camera moves from being a top down puzzle adventure game to a first person perspective and it’s at this point where you start to notice the graphics of the game, allowing you to see more of the surrounding environment more than before. From the top down perspective the graphics don’t really seem to great however once you start looking through Doug’s eyes you notice some smaller things in the game. And this was a great way to use the shift in perspective because there are things that you can only see through Doug’s eyes at this point such as items on the middle shelf or a piece of information written on a notice board. While in this first-person section, there were times when I had to stop playing for a few minutes, and just breath. I don’t mind admitting that I got genuinely spooked by the atmosphere it managed to create.Whether you should play this game is determined by your tastes as a gamer. If you’re on the older side and looking to play as many adventure games as you can or don’t like puzzles, horror games, or any horror games that don’t take themselves seriously, I can’t say I’d recommend BlackBay Asylum. As for me, I think that Blackbay Asylum is a welcome addition to my Steam library and hearkens back to the days of top down action adventure, with a touch of horror, and some first person puzzle games which is terrific."

Being an avid horror lover, I figured why not give this game a chance; I am definitely not disappointed! I currently have nearly 5 hours on record while on Chapter 5, which for those unaware there are 10 Chapters included in the game. The graphics may not be the most amazing you have ever seen. However, you will not be disappointed as the game is packed with puzzles that will not only challenge you, but also test your ability to retain information.Some people have complained about ""typos"" or the fact that there is no ability to save between levels (that's right folks - you have to beat the chapter or it won't remember your progress). Despite the whining of others out there, I found the typos to be apart of the game's charm as you are playing a psychotic killer who obviously is not the sharpest knife in the drawer, lol. I also want to mention that Doug has a very dry sarcastic personality, which can sometimes be downright hilarious as well as borderline offensive; you will see his personality is based on his limited understanding of the world and society in general.Also, the inability to save challenged me to focus and complete a chapter either in one sitting or retain where all the clues were so when I came back through I could catch-up to where I was quickly. Thus, I would not let a few minor things that people did not like keep you from this awesome indie horror game that you are sure to love. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves horror, puzzles, or adventure in general!"

It's like a higher res playstation 1 game.

76561198018899489,Recommended,313140,14963932,"Posted: 19 March, 2015",all,KingHadas,"I've been interested in this game since I saw Jim Sterlings greenlight video mocking it. Twenty dollars was too rich a gamble for me, seeing it on sale for 5 though I bought it immediately. No regrets.It's a funny little puzzle adventure game with early nineties PC graphics. They're not beautiful, in fact they're really ugly but they fit well with the games flippant attitude. Doug, our protaganist, is the mouthpiece for the majority of the game and to be honest I thought his goofball one-liners were really at odd with who he is but whatever. The game doesn't take its self seriously so why should I?The puzzles are pretty good. The first few are infantile but they get harder and more interesting. Sometimes you'll get stuck because you missed an item which is a common failing of Point-and-Clicks. But to be fair this is not a Point-and-Click, its a Move-and-Push-Space and Doug is one bigass cursor. So comparitivily it's a little easier to find things you missed.My only solid complaint is the voice acting, it's terrible. Doug is mercifully mute but you meet NPCs whose voices are somehow both obnoxious and boring. I can't skip through their dialouge fast enough!I still dont think its worth twenty dollars but it was a fine game for five."

And let's be honest, the graphics of this game are pretty awful. Animations are pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥too.However, the idea behind the game interested me so much that I bought the game. And it was very entertaining from start to finish!I'm usually not the puzzle-kind-of-guy, but the puzzles in this game were pretty understandable and fun to solve. The rest of the gameplay is your typical run around and discover what items to pick up and how to use them.The best part about this game is the story. Being inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, there are very interesting (and disturbing) things that you find out about Black Bay Asylum. I'm not gonna spoil it, but it was an exciting time I had with the game, and every new unlocked part of the game made me more interested to find out what's happening next.Another very fun thing about this game is the protagonist. Playing a psychopath opens some interesting ways to solve some puzzles. Also, Doug has funny lines even for some very mundane things, which keeps the game interesting, even if you are just running around clicking on random stuff.Two major flaws that I want to mention:1. I don't like how some puzzles can actually kill you if you fail. This happens only 2-3 times in the game, but I don't like to re-do stuff, just because I didn't do it in the arbitrary way the dev wants me to.2. There are no save-games in this game. So if you start a chapter, you should make sure you complete it in one sitting, because the game only saves whatever chapter you have unlocked.But even those flaws (while being a bit of annoying) did not lower the fun I had while playing.Overall I can recommend this game to anyone who is interested in the obscure story and doesn't care if the game looks like from the early PS1 era."

Uninstalled as many puzzles are not described properly for you to find a logical solution. Lots of bad spelling typos too (didn't the dev think to use a spell checker or does he suffer from dyslexia?). No proper save in between chapters, so if you want to quit you have to either finish the current chapter or start over again. Chosen resolution and windows/full screen option doesnt save either, so that gets a pain to deal with also.

76561198010608791,Recommended,313140,22890877,"Posted: 9 May, 2016",all,SeriousStrelok,"Well, this wasn't what I expected. BA (Blackbay Asylum) is exactly what I needed at a recent time of personal horror/adventure-craving. It's not easy finding many horror games that are this scary while focusing on puzzles. Yes, BA is at its core an adventure/puzzle game. It's even comparable to Sherlock Holmes The Awakened in a few ways: puzzle-heavy game with Lovecraftian horror and Cthulhu story.PROS: Considering that most of the game is in top-down perspective, the creep factor is still huge as you wonder what you're going to come across at every corner. I say ""most"" because a few parts of this game are in first-person. Amazingly the game brilliantly combines the two gameplay styles together without difficulty. I have to admit that Chapter 3 (in its 1st person) was a level I won't forget anytime soon; this area frightened me so much I had to take minor breaks. While I don't need breathers while replaying (knowing now what to expect) I will say the level includes some horrific/bizarre imagery and edge-of-your-seat sound. You'll find more quality and depth in this one mission than the entirety of most other horror games! I also love the protagonist's endless un-PC comments whenever he interacts with something he cannot pick up. If you aren't easily offended, you'll get more than a few laughs. There are some good challenging puzzles which ocassionally required a walkthrough, but otherwise make you feel good as you accomplish them.CONS: Given the chapter count, you would think during the first few levels that the game is lengthy. Unfortunately it's not. Surprisingly while some chapters are long, some are ridiculously short in comparison. If you know what to do, one of them can even be completed in less than 30 seconds! The second half of the game isn't as engaging either. From the 1st Chapter your character lawnmowers a mad cook, later followed by the horrifying 3rd. These left me wondering, could the game get any more compelling and strange? Not necessarily, but I certainly wouldn't expect it to be less! As you delve closer to the Cthulhu-mystery the game loses a lot of the shock and style that it opens up with. I liked the final boss ""battle"" but the concluding cutscene, though interesting, was brief and made little sense. It almost seemed very anti-climatic, and this doesn't look the kind of game that aches for a sequel.Overall, I enjoyed the game a lot and it's well worth a purchase. I do think there's a slight missed opportunity here though. As a Cthulhu-inspired story it had a lot of potential, and the game's first half makes you believe it will reach it. Though it never ceases to be fun, I did feel a bit let down towards the end with the lack of horrifying build-up. Maybe I was expecting too much, but when the first few levels really displayed something special I would hope the game persisted from that. Still, if you're looking for some challenging puzzles filled with memorable and horrific moments then BA might be the right choice!77/100"
,Recommended,313140,28958958,Posted: 2 January,all,Doctor-Gadget,"When I first hear of Blackbay Asylum I immediately got interested, despite not being a fun of puzzles, but a gore and insane-related stuff lover.The game is very interesting and catchy, with a psycho killer who has to explore an asylum to get out from and realizes that something there isn't right: monsters, dead bodies everywhere and a terrible truth to discover.Puzzles are the main part of this game: in order to continue your adventure you have to explore the place and resolve these puzzles; some of them are very easy, while others apparently look difficult, but once you realize how simple these lasts are, you can beat the game with no problems. And the diary helps you with them.The gore is also an another element that impressed me a lot, despite the simplicity of the graphic, mostly when I played in first/person mode (and Chapter 3 scaried me a lot, just to say). And I kinda liked it.At the end I really enjoyed the game and I would suggest it to puzzle and gore lovers."
,Recommended,313140,14793496,"Posted: 8 March, 2015",all,Nth RooCH,"This is a pretty niché title, and I strongly believe would only really be enjoyed by a select sort of gamer. Let's look at the basics. It's a very old school looking top down (and occasionally First Person) adventure title. Gory and silly humour, horror theme, and plenty of puzzles along the way. The puzzles are generally fair (only ever found 1 that the clues, or lack thereof, weren't good enough for me to understand), and the story is just silly enough to keep you interested throughout the campaign.The bad, however, are fairly obvious things. Firstly, it's a very old school game. Meaning the gameplay is a little clunky, the action sequences can frustrate, and the graphics are notably dated. It's also a fairly short game. Almost all of the chapters can be completed within about 10-20 minutes. The only exceptions are longer because the actual gameplay takes longer (such as the first person sections, where the movement is quite annoyingly slow).Those things aside though, I had fun with it, and for the price, I can't really argue with the length or gameplay quality. This is the kind of game that people who still revel in retro would find enjoyable. You have to push past the annoyances to get to the fun, but the fun is there."

For instance Blackbay Asylum starts you off in a birds-eye view perspective then depending on the chapter or/and situation will automatically switch you to a first-person view; then once you complete the chapter or complete a certain task in the game it switches back to birds-eye view which along with the graphics doesn’t clash with the overall gaming experience instead it enhances it.  While the game itself has sick twisted sense of humor to it that can be very funny at times which is due to the protagonist Doug reaction in not just in cut scenes and situations he finds himself in, but also when you interact with the environment around you in general in terms of dialogue.  Lastly the main strength of the Blackbay Asylum seems to be the puzzles which come in not just a mixture of reasonable difficulty, but also the creative ways you have to go about solving the puzzles by finding clues with in the environment itself which the clues presents themselves in a way that doesn’t hold your hand which helps with the overall pacing of the game and gave will give a sense of accomplishment (note: unless you have a photographic memory I would recommend pencil and paper on certain puzzles).While I did enjoyed playing Blackbay Asylum, however the game is not flawless it does have certain glitch issues and concerns I have (best way to describe it), but in no way ruin the gaming experience but stood out which I put them into two categories neutral = +/- and negative = -:Neutral:+/- Screen Settings: Which it can be only be access by going back to the point where the warning content label appears.  When you get to this setting you have two screen options window and fullscreen, now window no matter what screen resolution is chosen it works while fullscreen seems to only work on the first resolution 1024 X 780.+/- Story- The story is handled well when presented in forms journals, logs, files, letters and talking to some of the inhabitants while in general it does come across a little cliché and certain part seemed rushed; for example in one chapter Doug reminiscence’s a part of his previous life which would been interesting to see more of this in gameplay and/or story considering the ending that I saw which will make you formulate two conclusions.+/- atmosphere- Now the game doesn’t go out of its way to necessary scare you but does provide certain type of discomfort which seems to be more of a mix bag.  For instance in the game while in birds-eye view all you can here is the music and the sounds of your footsteps will creates an eerie feeling with in the game, then once you get further enough a in gameplay event occurs which the overall execution in terms of tension was great, but there was part of me that feels that this was put in too early while the other believes the main issue is that this gameplay event doesn’t occur little bit more.  Lastly the first person view is highly variable is the best way to describe it.  I think part of the problem is from my perspective there is no type of game over if protagonist becomes too distress going into certain areas which is understandable because base off of my time playing it seems the developers goal was to immerse player’s in the environment (recommend playing this game in dark with headset on ).Negative:-	Only saves fully after completing chapter-	Replay ability (note: review ends here and only represents my time playing the game and things that stood out to me which if your still not sure I recommend to read other reviews, go to the community forum to ask questions or check for any type of game updates.

I had this issue originally with my Windows 10 PC and the game was completely unplayable with framerates as low as 1-4FPSThe developer did say that there should be a fix on the way, but that was a while ago and I don't think this issue can be solved making this game broken. I did originally ask for a refund but the wonderful staff at Steam told me to bog off and did not offer me a refundThe only way you can fix this is by either reverting back to a previous version of Windows 10 which removes the update that made the game completely unplayable or do like me and play it on a PC (or laptop in my case) that has either Windows 8 or Windows 7 installed on it, otherwise don't bother getting this gameI do hope a fix can be made for this game as I would like to play it on my better PC but as it seems, this issue cannot be fixed...I therefore only recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of adventure games and wants something bloody and freaky and does not have Windows 10, otherwise, don't bother getting this game that had so much potential...RECOMMENDED :)If you have an earlier version of Windows or got the game working somehow, otherwise...NOT RECOMMENDED :(If you have Windows 10"

The typos often take the form of broken English and as for 'contradictions' I believe the biggest that comes to mind is the fact that in the intro it states that Blackbay is 8 mi. off the coast of Innsmouth, Mass. yet a little later in the game there is an indication in a journal entry or pamphlet that states it's 12 mi.That aside, I did enjoy this game and Lovecraftian themes are always a plus in my book (uber Lovecraft fans may argue that this borrows a little too heavily from HPL's lore without giving a proper shout-out to the mythos he created, such as by straight up saying that the main baddie in the game is Cthulhu...which it clearly is!!).Regardless, as far as puzzle/adventure games go, this isn't half bad, but do yourself a favor and hold out for a sale if you do decide to get a copy."

Not that it is a horrible game by any stretch, just not my cup of tea I guess. I got it on sale for 5$ however and if you are lucky enough to grab that up then maybe. I think I'd actually be upset had I paid full price for it.Blackbay Asylum is a horror game set in asylum, and while asthetically that appealed to me I think the game designers could have done a better job with it's execution. But that isn't what they are all about either... It seems like their whole attitude about this game was to make it as over the line as they could...right down to the disclaimer on the opening screen.One of the things I like most about this game is that the (hero?) is such an... unlikeable; or even evil character. I thought that was a pretty interesting spin on it and was anxious to give that a shot. The menus and dialogue are intuitive and easy to use; it's not really a hard game to play.The biggest reason I'm not recommending this game is because of the flow of the game. The game goes from a move at your own pace speed of game to a do this now or die speed with little to no warning at times. And when you have to redo an entire chapter because you weren't quite quick enough to figure that out it's a little annoying. Some of the puzzles in this game are easy, some of them a bit more challenging; and some of them are downright bizarre and not intuitive at all. I play a lot of video games and really very seldom have to look to community guides for help, but I did have to in here. And in all fairness even after having the answer I could say yeah, I never would have thought of that.Overall I'd rate this game about a 5 out of 10. I wish they had a step between recommend and not because to me this is neither really. It's not a horrible game, just not a good one. If you're interested, get it on sale and give it a shot. To me it would not be worth 20$ though."

Games like portal had a way of guiding the eye towards what might be a clue -- this game leaves you to pixel-hunt over and over and over. if you don't press space is the exact right spot you won't even know an object is the ONLY OBJECT YOU CAN INTERACT WITH TO PROCEED. 99.9% of the objects in the game do nothing and are just decoration, but scattered among them are objects that are of critical importance and there is NOTHING that suggests their significance until you've picked them up.

There were a few occasions when I got stuck with the puzzles. In one instance I almost gave up. But once I got past that everything was okay lolhttp://youtu.be/FCLC-3d4YikThere is no combat. It's basically a series of riddles and puzzles. The puzzles are challenging and feature quite a bit of variety. I had to sort of cheat a bit by checking the community for answers and tips.The graphics are definitely not amazing. But I was happy with how the game looks. I thought it actually kind of looked better in first person perspective. Perhaps the whole game should be like that. However one really annoying issue with first person view for me was that the cursor would go into my outside the screen to my second screen. If I clicked while it was there the game would be minimized. This was a constant issue in first person view. I hope the dev fixes this. Yes the game is really gory which personally I generally don't really mind. But the one thing I would have liked not to have seen is the naked backside of the monster after it has passed you through it's system at the start of chapter 3. Also the game is full of jokes which I usually found amusing.So yeah if the style and the aesthetics of the game appeals and you like puzzles then this may be a good choice for you. It's not $5 but you can probably get an adequate amount of time out of the it for your money.Clickherefor my YouTube gaming channel"

If you have the chance to purchase this at $5 or so then I'd give it a whirl.Where to start?  It's an interesting concept, using a mental asylum as the backdrop.  A serial killer who's the protagonist.  Find your way out of the asylum and figure out what's going on.It's a concept that has been done before, and better -- Asylum I & II (Med Systems Software) in the 1980s, Sanitarium in the 1990s (available at various websites).  Radio Shack had a ghetto version of the asylum thriller called ""Bedlam"", it wasn't that good.The view is from above, and is basically a pixel hunt and a challenge of paying attention.  It's gruesome at times, inappropriately funny at others, sometimes just plain obscure.  Some of the puzzles are easy, some more complicated.I think that the main reason I would recommend against this game is the lack of a save feature.  You have to start at the beginning of a chapter each time you play.  This gets tedious.  Would it really have been that hard to add a save option?The whole testosterone-fueled, inappropriately humorous game was played out by Duke Nuke'em.  The humor in this game isn't really so juvenile as it is unnecessary.  It adds nothing to the experience.  Much of the humor is merely recycled cliches in one way or another.So, if I look at all the moments of my life as being precious and if I want to make sure that I don't waste those moments, I have to say no about this game.

Only to find out the doctors of the place are performing experiments on all patients, even rats!It gets nasty at times, with humans stitched upon other humans...in multiple ways.You see rats dissected after they evolve into massive rodents.Has great atmosphere, multiple dialogs if you keep 'inspecting' things, which nowadays adventure games don't really do anymore. It also has a lot of puzzles.Now the puzzles for the most part, are logical. But at some points I just got so confused I had to look up some door codes or set patterns because it became frustrating going back to read a certain clue and remember it by the time you needed it. Sometimes I had no clue at all what to do even when reading the clues, but it all does really make sense but might turn off people who don't like puzzles. Make no mistake, this is a puzzle game.Graphic wise, it reminds me of old PSX games. You play from a top down perspective, and a few levels use first person, which I could have done without.The game runs on my toaster of a PC no problem.it works flawlessly with my Steam Controller.Adventure game fans would love this.
