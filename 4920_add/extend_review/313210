,Not Recommended,313210,14905328,"Posted: 15 March, 2015",all,Silverstream,"I did not play this game. I endured it. This product fails in almost every regard.The graphics and animations are terrible, they look barely better than the original Playstation.The sounds are generic and often are implemented wrong. In the level where youdestroy 12 cent's sports carthe baseball bat makes a clanging sound even when you miss. On multiple occasions, I've heard enemies death sound effects when I plant explosives or pick up extra health.The controls are terrible and you will die repeatedly (or at least more than usual) if you do not rebind them. The down button crouches, but the up button makes you crouch and move forward. Jump and melee are 1 and 2 for some inexplicable reason.The combat is mindless and unfair. You just aim at an enemy and open fire with your infinite pistol or machine gun until they die. You will take hits from the enemies no matter how good you get. The game hides instant death traps behind foreground objects, and I have had humvees drive through walls and kill me.In addition to ALL OF THIS, the game is glitchy. As I said before, humvees will occasionally drive through walls and kill you, falling off a building can crash the game, and I've even been hit by a humvee through a wall and ended up outside the play area. I was promptly run over by a humvee that drove through a building.In short, this game is terrible in every way. Every way except its enjoyability. For some strange reason, I found an odd charm to it. Its story was as cliche as possible and the gameplay really shouldn't have been fun, but it kind of was. If you like games that are so bad that they're kind of fun, then this game could be worth picking up. For everyone else though, I would highly recommend you stay away."

To truely understand just how horrific this game is a person needs only turn it on for the first time.  I am pretty certain I got this game for less than a dollar, and that is one dollar I'll never see back.This game is worse than one of those free flash games you get from a shady website that pop's up while your surfing for porn in the middle of the night.  In fact many of those games are far superior to this mess.I'd say this game is like getting a root canel, as the numbing agent starts to wear off and you can feel the dentist begin to kill the roots in your teeth.  Except having that done is probably more fun than this flaming pile of refuge.Please do yourself a favor, take that dollar you would have spend playing this game, set it on fire and place the charred remains between two slices of bread.... you would get more value out of your money this way...Although if you do buy the game, keep in mind you'll join the ranks of gamers like myself who love picking up crap..."

I had to map the keys with Xpadder to a 360 controller because the defaults require 0 and 1 as keys and my laptop has fourth row keys for numbers (Zero and One are on opposite sides). Now instead of changing them I decided to skip/upgrade straight to a controller but it doesnt change the horrible basics of control in the game. First flaw, left and right are called left and right but up and down are labeled forwards and back which is the opposite of intuitive. The enemies are either blind and deaf or they see you from off screen and when you crouch you move slowly foward. I felt like I was playing a lighting demo and the game was coded in an hour to use said lighting. Lame."

This game is the exact opposite of what Spec Ops: The Line was trying to do, and the results are just fantastic.Here are a few sample activities you will experience while playing Alpha Zylon:- being chased by a Hummer only for it to blow up after you run for so long- attacking hostages to free them from captivity- witness the death of your commanding officer, only to see him perfectly fine 2 episodes later- blow up a bridge in a desolate Brazilian village for no reason- become a rooftop crime fighting vigilante while rich white people give you health packs (I cannot make this crap up)- beat on notorious gang member ""12 Cent's"" new car with a baseball bat until it blows up- live through an onslaught of gang members and hummers in a first person shooting segment (I had a Hummer climb over the wall and fall on me more than once. The first time was admittedly pretty amusing.)And yes, that is only a few of the activities you will experience. I actually recommend playing this once, just to question what the devs were thinking when they made this game. It's a memorable experience, to say in the least.And yes, I did beat it, dear God."

This game is a do not buy, And I heard someone made a complete remake of this game thats better, and its free on Newgrounds or one of those websites. Like I said on my War Operations review, Games like this,War Operation and Bad rats are the reason why Strategy first died."

Coming out in 2007 is such a surpirse for the amount of content and gameplay you're getting. The graphics, while some may say they're dated, I'd say they aged nicley, having a stylistic point of view also does great for the gameplay. The sound is wonderfully composed, Mozart himself may have had a hand in the music. The story, amazingly written and for a mature audience, plus this comes with not one, not two, not three, but THREE CAMPAIGNS. The first one tells of an epic straight from a Tom Clancy novel, you are Brad McBadass and must search for your enemy's super weapon, how did you get there and why do you have three minutes and nine seconds? that just adds directly to the experience, then you must murder all of the terrorists and save the buyers in an action packed ride straight from a Tom Cruise movie. The second is another epic straight from the Hardy Boys, you are the same hero, Brad McBadass who must stop a drug cartel and Rambo style take out all the drug boys surrounding the camp. The third one is an epic straight from something I would make up while sh!tting, this one I think acts as a prequel to the other two. So you're young Brad McBadass, there are thugs all armed with the exact same gun on a rooftops, you are tasked by Latino Jesus to kill all of those thugs in a straight line and avoid his clones. After you destroy the threats that the cops can't handle you must destroy none other than El Chapo's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cousin's car with a baseball bat, **** using a gun. Then you must take out the gang members and all the cars that come flying at you in a rage induced high. The sheer quality of this game alone coupled with the writing makes this a must own for every single steam user that has, will, and does exist!"
