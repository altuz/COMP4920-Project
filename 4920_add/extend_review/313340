,Recommended,313340,12871672,"Posted: 9 November, 2014",all,Duke Silver,"I don't think a lot of people don't see the value in Mountain, and when people do they tend to simply overcomplicate the game for what it is. It's not meant to be a 'game' exactly. The developers of the game purposefully say this originally: ""Leave it open - it's designed to run in the periphery of your life. Only interact with it when you feel like it. You can play Mountain while playing other games. If you are not playing it, it will play itself. "". Again Mountain is just mean to be left open and you can return to it when you feel like it. You might not see the aspect of it originally but you can find it later… hopefully. But then again, what are the standards of a 'game'? Are we to simply segregate Mountain simply because it is possibly outside of the norm? On the contrary! Different experiences lead to different viewpoints which make you more open-minded. So can people truly state that Mountain is not a game but a screensaver? There are many ways to view Mountain and seeing it as a screensaver is one of the more popular demoralizing viewpoints to which many have so acquired. So one can only view Mountain as simply a standalone and not compare it to more contemporary issues. Or one can compare it but by doing so one loses the face value of the game itself. I think I've settled for now the dispute that this 'game' might be a screensaver or simply not a 'game' at all.On another note, the developers stated this: ""If you're having an annoying storm or boring night, play a melody (using your keyboard) and time will accelerate."" Mountain is there for you when you decide to return to it and play it. I think that is a common misconception. It's not as much meant to be a 'game' but rather a subsidiary and supporting game next to you. Yet there are many ways to view Mountain as with any form of issue in life. But the Way Mountain was constructed, at times unappealing to the eye, allows it to show you a different path and possibly one you may not have seen before hand.But you don't have to follow what the developers say. A 'game' is meant to be played whichever way you feel like it. If you feel like you've been cheated off by buying this game, then take two steps back and think about the aspects of this 'game' and the elements. Perhaps you begin to notice that wonderful ambient sound that plays amidst the night, or perhaps you fall in love with the way the streaks of the sun touch your Mountain. But you might not have to like all these things to truly enjoy the game. Perhaps you have all these games and you developed a love for the game. Or perhaps you try to ridicule the game but in turn you've actually Grown accustomed to the game. I for one cannot answer that question of whether a gamer should like this or not, but it is all up to the gamer who buys it, and whether he is willing to open up his heart and mind.Now is the Mountain truly your Mountain and your own property? I think that is in the conception of the gamer alone for the gamer can make notion whether the Mountain truly is a self embodiment, or the player truly controls the Mountain. Does the Mountain not speak to us and tell us of its thoughts? Or is it conveying a hidden message to where we might be its own spawn and it is the master. Whichever way you see fit, there are quite a lot of ways to see Mountain, as with any game. Mountain might not have a storyline, no shooting, no love triangle (unless you begin to make one up between somehow the items, the Mountain, and the sky in which case you probably might have gone a bit too far), but Mountain contains a moment of solitude in which you might notice things in games that can be recurrent in Mountain. Perhaps Mountain might contain all these elements in which you create the story. Mountain can always be a storyline in which you, the gamer, is going along a path with the Mountain to a destination into your subconscious. There is much to do in Mountain and blocking your imagination and logic will only hinder it. But if you so choose to do so than you have not hurt no one but yourself in denying the possible powers in the 'game' itself. This review cannot display my neutrality toward the game but I only wish to explain to the gamer that Mountain can only be accentuated by only the gamer.And another thing many question is the role of the keyboard in the game. Although at first it may seem like the keys simply advance time and increase it in a way the human eye can perceive, Mountain is inevitably omnipresent and time is of little importance to him. Binding ourselves to this thought, we can perceive the passing of time as not one full of dread and dreariness, not one full of change and a different scenery, but becoming part of the universe and its infinite realm of possibilities. What we perceive as a minute can seem as nothing more than what has occurred to the Mountain. What we perceive as the future is simply the happening in the Mountain. What we perceive as the past is imply seen as the done by the Mountain.And another question still remains as to what is the value of the items that the Mountain contains and at times loses. Are those pieces of our memories or life lessons that we must cope to accept? Or are those as somewhat like to put it as simple items that simply 'fall' on the Mountain. No they are granted upon the Mountain and delivered first hand to the Mountain or possibly to you. And what is of this item leaving our grasp and floating off into space? Have we broken your heart, Mountain? Have we done some unforgivable act too which I've lost my pony? That alone can be answered only by the gamer and his affiliation with the mountain.And what of this inevitable destruction that reaches the doorsteps of the Mountain ever so often. Are we to simply ponder over the oblivion of the Mountain or sputter key notes to protect the Mountain? Or can we observe the Mountain and it's destruction in all its gloom and tidings of change too which a new Mountain is brought forth to bring new waves of joy to the gamer, too which the cycle is repeated. Why do we have the ability to protect the Mountain or is it even in our ability to protect it? Is it predestined that we protected or is it by our own free-will? That is something that neither I can answer you and only you can resolve either by justifying it or believing in something.This setting that surrounds the Mountain is quite serene and yet the darkness around it is quite opposite. Is this serving as a contrast between dark and light? The battle of how light destroys the darkness. Or perhaps the story has been switched and light is simply a harbinger of this cycle of death that is ever so dreaded upon. Again, I am not in any sort of ability to answer that question, and it alone can be sought through the Mountain.So if you ever feel hurt or saddened than perhaps a tune on the fashioned keyboard can mend your heart. Or perhaps a stressed out day simply requires a concerto done by your own imagination. And maybe in the end when you've discovered the infinite combinations on the keys that by which you alone and the Mountain as well contains in the hidden locks of memory, you realize all this and then come to think in terms of the Mountain, and how time is not congruent, but simply an assortment of things by which we alone can process and that by which we alone can control. Mountain is infinite and it is up to the gamer only to perceive the game as he wishes."

You could grab random objects, arrange them, see the seasons change, maybe there would be some birds flying around. It gave the impression that even though there wasn't a point to the game, the experience alone would be fun, and you'd stick to it just to see what would happen.But I never saw that. I played for 20 minutes. I spun the camera, i played the keytar, I zoomed in and out, I found every feature on my mountain. It rained, i spun the mountain to make the clouds go away. I saw the little thoughts my mountain had. But nothing happened. I pressed every button, manipulated every control I could think of, and made as many patterns with my mouse as I could imagine, and nothing happened.I can't honestly recommend it, because I've had more enjoyment from that Windows '95 screensaver about a maze (with the rat in it) than I did from this game. Maybe there's more to it than I thought, maybe you need to leave it on overnight for something to happen. But it's not presented in a way that makes me want to stick around to find out."

,Recommended,313340,30264624,Posted: 1 March,all,Doll & Chain,"I don't really play video games.  An old shoulder injury prevents me from manipulating a mouse at a computer for longer than what is required for work.  A few weeks ago, I herniated a disc in my spine and was bedridden for several days.  I discovered Mountain.  A video game with no controls.  Initially, I had the same reaction as everyone else.  Neat, a pet rock to check in on occasionally with calm music and ambient sounds!  Perfect!But unlike everyone else, I kept Mountain up at the forefront of my computer screen while I knitted and listened to podcasts.   I interacted with Mountain a lot.  I spoke to it, cared after it like it was a plant.  After 30+ hours of game play, I realized that this game actually has a few delightful little secrets.You actually do have some control in this game.  The objects that land can be rearranged and moved by clicking and holding on them.  But if you move an object too many times in a row, it can be lost, and too many lost items makes Mountain depressed.  You can also literally shake off clouds.  Mountain is intuitive to your interactions with it.  The more you click on it, the more positive and happy the thoughts are.  I once was rearranging objects and moving and clicking around for a solid 15 minutes and Mountain's response was, ""I'm a total babe."" Another time, I was rearranging objects and lost a cool item, so I closed out and reopened to the last save, and it responded with, ""Wasn't I just here?""Mountain gets depressed and lonely if you leave it alone too long.  It appears that it when you have the game running for several hours, eventually, Mountain starts pulling away from you by zooming out slowly on its own.  If you let it zoom out all the way and forget to zoom in again, Mountain eventually crashes into something fatal.You can also play musical notes with certain keys of your keyboard, and certain melodies will trigger different events.  If you catch Mountain in the midst of crashing into something fatal, you can spam these notes to put up a shield to avoid death.I'm still in recovery now, and will continue to play it, and mess with it, and am excited to see what other secrets this game has to discover.  At one point, Mountain said, ""The patterns are hidden.  The game is to help them find themselves.""David O'Reilly once said in an interview: ""Everything interacts with itself and everything around it throughout time and space. Everything is also a game, including this sentence, where I can make your eye move left to right, and make sense of these abstract shapes we’ve agreed upon. You’re rendering these shapes into thought on my behalf, it only feels like you’re in control, and you are for the most part, but I’m guiding you, and I want you to keep going, even though you can quit at any time.""Mountain is a piece of interactive art.  I'm glad to have discovered it when I did, and in the way that I did, in order to really appreciate what O'Reilly has created."

76561198011336658,Recommended,313340,11832935,"Posted: 23 August, 2014",all,Kim Jong UN,"Mountain works well as an artistic statement; it's fairly direct in its questioning of what is/isn't a game but outside of that there is still a lot of fun and humor in the game/non-game.The arts-y side of things:One of the most important aspects of this is the presentation! Mountain first and foremost feels almost like the modern gaming answer to the post-WWI Dada art movement. Where Dada used collages and pre-made works (such as a urinal) and presented them as high art by putting them into galleries in order to challenge the concept of art, Mountain puts itself on the steam store under 'rpg-games' when I think you'd be hard-pressed to find it fitting this term. The 'gameplay' in Mountain is virtually non-existent, since the act of playing Mountain is leaving in on in the background until you hear a sound and can view whatever new content pops up. Like a lot of (post)modern-art Mountain is ultimately making whatever artistic statement you get out of it, there's no real easy answer here.Ok, but how is the ""game"" fun?:Well it's pretty relaxing, the visuals are amazingly surreal and serene. There's a lot of goofy items that will periodically crash into your mountain as you leave the program running and your Mountain will often present these funny faux-deep statements about its existence; this effectively works as a way of the game poking fun at its artistic ambitions. While it's hard to say these are of any real substance they're genuinely funny and will at least make you smile reading them. You can check up on your Mountain to see trees grow, seasons pass but the mountain remains a constant.The only thing that really bothered me about Mountain was the clouds that will clip through the mountain rather than moving around in a way that doesn't make it look so artificial, also some shadow issues happen from time to time. These might seem like minor nitpicks but this can take you out of the expirence.If you're in the market for a piece of relaxing software that you can leave on while you're working/using the internet/playing other ""real"" games the Mountain is great, it engages you by being fairly passive. With it being a $1 it's kind of hard not to recommend it to anyone interested."

On some computers, this will cause overheating which is entirely unnecessary in a glorified screensaver.*The game isn't limiting resource usage on its own, so it's causing components to run too hot. It's using more resources than much larger, graphically intensive titles. This is indicative of poor programming, not that any one persons computer is lacking. Any computer would have more trouble running this program than what is reasonable, and it's caused by the same lazy developer who decided to sell a thrown together mess of pretentious bile.  Any attempt to explain what this game is actually trying to say is going to end up being a guess at something the developer doesn't even understand.  A stream of conciousness has never been so dull and pathetically attention seeking, while still managing to turn your room into a furnace.It's unacceptable, and nobody should fall victim to buying this abysmal excuse for a game.If you ""play"" this ""game"" as if it were a screensaver, you'll get a somewhat interesting, passive piece of eyecandy that might grab your interest every once and a while"

I wondered what in the world it was so was compelled to go check out the store page.  Well to be honest it didn't look like much, a mountain floating in mid air with stuff growing on it.  But hey, at ninety nine cents what can you expect really.  I mean, sure I could have turned that same buck into a tasty cheeseburger or chili dog, maybe gotten a soda or ice cream cone but something made me want to buy this game....  So what did my dollar get me this time??Well so far I've drawn three pictures, and seen a mountain spinning around and around.  Not sure if they all start this way but mine seems to have a bare spot on one side.  I've seen pretty fireflies, watched night turn into day several times, winter came and went, and I've played a few notes on the keyboard as well as seen what the mountain is thinking from time to time.  And that's it, nearly an hour into the game and I've seemingly done all the interactivity you can do with it.Wait, what's that? I just heard it talk in the background......something about seeing itself in this night.....  Uh..... Is that a mushroom, a red mushroom???  That wasn't there before.... and what happened to that lone shrub that was on the bare side?  Now it's even barer than before.....  And what's this deep rumbling noise I keep hearing??  Like thunder but it's sunny out...  And this, my friends is the lure and fun of Mountain.  Patience and a deep craving to see what happens next and then being in shock and awe when something does happen.  It’s not a high speed, boom, bang game.  It’s  a slow, lazy river kind of game you'll set in the background while doing something else.Did I mention that I love lava lamps?  No really I totally love lava lamps.  What does that have to do with this review??  Well Mountain is kind of like a lava lamp on steroids for your computer.  You don't really do much with it.  Not a lot to play with really.  Oh there are some secret tunes you can play to make things happen but honestly, at the end of the day; this ""game"" is about leaving it run and seeing what happens from time to time.  And much like the lava lamps in my bedroom you could just sit there watching this mountain spinning around and doing its thing and be absolutely mesmerized with it.  Why?  Because it's simple.  Because it's like life in the fact that you never know what's going to happen next.  Because there's something totally relaxing about it.  Now, if you'll excuse me, it's winter on my mountain and it's totally covered in snow.  Think I'm going to go watch it for a while....  Huh, there's a tiny planet now stuck in the side of my mountain...................weird.............."

To really enjoy what this game has to offer, one needs to have patience and an open mind. Mountain isn't an action-packed, groundbreaking journey; instead, it's a breath of fresh air in our otherwise hectic lives.While the controls are rather self-explanatory, there is a sort of ""piano"" that players can use within the game. The keys for striking up a tune are A-K and Z-M. I don't believe they have any direct effect towards the gameplay, but they're still fun to mess with.Ultimately, this game is perfect for those who need a little time to wind down and get away from everything.-(2/7/17) EDIT: Apparently playing specific tunes with the ""piano"" will initiate certain events!

Anyone who reviews Mountain as if it is your traditional game needs to reevaluate it under a different perspective.Mountain can be seen as a screensaver, visual entertainment, aesthetically appealing content--anything along these categories. If all you do from morning to night is play mainstream high-action games (i.e. Dota 2, CS:GO, etc.), you probably will not immediately be able to enjoy the abstract simplicity that this game offers.Let's get down straight to the meat of this. The only user interaction that you have at your disposal is using your mouse to move the mountain three-dimensionally, your keyboard to play music notes (which can be used to unlock easter eggs), picking up and organising ""artefacts"" that drop on your mountain overtime, and the almighty eye of the beholder to watch the mountain collect random objects and pile up on the mountain. The biggest input the player has to the game is three questions asked in the beginning, prompting the user to draw three images to represent three different things (i.e. mother).The only spontaneous events to occur are a meteor that may destroy your mountain and changing weathers/seasons. Ocasionally your mountain will ""think"" and provide some interesting, philosophical annotations about its existence. If you leave the game open for a few minutes, your camera eventually will zoom out into an outer-space view of the mountain.I would recommend it buying it especially for how cheap it is (kudos to the developers for not overrating their game). I really just leave the game open and use it to take a break from my studying to look up at the screen and just relax a bit.You can check out why Mountain is a legitimate thing here:http://www.pcgamer.com/why-the-media-loves-mountain-but-steam-users-are-calling-it-a-screensaver/"

,Recommended,313340,28708086,"Posted: 27 December, 2016",all,othrr,"An ExperienceAbstractMountain should not be considered a game, it is an interactive piece of art. One that promotes meta-physical philosophical thought, and one that doubles as a relaxing view of an amazing Mountain. The meaning of this isn’t hard to unearth, it only takes a willingness to dig.A truly beautiful game.The PurchaseWhen I first purchased Mountain it was out of curiosity. There seemed to be something that drew me to purchasing it, it was less than a dollar after all.David O’Reilly created an aesthetic for this work that challenged the premise of contemporary art and modern video games. As an artist and film-maker, he ventures far and walks the line of virtual reality and our reality. Mountain is not a game, and nor is it a background program (as many reviewers say it is). It is an expression of the mind, it is a work of art. A critique of Mountain cannot be done from the perspective of entertainment or aesthetics, it must be done from the view of the raw human mind.OpeningOpening Mountain leads directly a blank space framed with a black border. To the top of the blank space, in the frame is written a random word. Mountain then urges a player to “Draw Something”. At face value this seems almost silly, but the randomly generated word isn’t so random. It is something that is a large part of our lives as humans. It begs the question: What does this word mean to us? In my first experience of this, my first word was “Art”. My task then was to create a visual representation of art that fits my definition of what art means to me. After painting in only black and white, the user is prompted to click done. This then repeats for a second and third time. The next drawings I made were of “Fear” and “Confusion”.With progression into Mountain, it is learned that whatever I drew in the beginning had no effect on the mountain itself. As if to hint that whatever those words meant to us, mean nothing to the rest of life. That our lives mean less in the big picture than what we define our lives with.After the three drawings a mountain is generated. With a holy choir note in the background, the user is spoken to. “You are mountain.” says the game “You are God.”“Please Enjoy Your Time Here.”Then I was left with a mountain.MountainIn what seems like an endless endeavor, Mountain rotates in an empty space.With time, day and night will pass, Fall will turn to Winter, and Spring will dry into Summer. Rain will wash down the slopes of Mountain and winds will ruffle the trees growing on the sides.Every once in a while Mountain will think. With a pleasant note, a thought appears on the top of the screen. But this thought is seems empty. It is almost, meaningless in the grand scheme of things. The thoughts of Mountain are small compared to what the situation is.These thoughts are a connection to the daily life of Man. How our small opinions have no real impact on the world around us. When Mountain speaks the thoughts are comments on its current position in the universe.However I would be wrong if I said that all of Mountain’s thoughts are transparent.Some comments paint the grim reality of many people.“Why am I alone?”“I don’t really know what I am”“What Am I? Are you part of me too?”These thoughts appear in between the comments on the warm Spring sun and on the bright blue sky.After observing these more meta-physical questions, the normal thoughts are shown in a new light. It leads to one thinking that these thoughts are all that there is in life, that in an empty and endless world our voice is the only existential connection to our being.But this is idea is quickly brushed away. Maybe there is something else to remind us of our being.Maybe materialistic entities can be our connection to ourselves.So every once in a while, about as often as Mountain thinks, an item falls onto Mountain.The item has no meaning. It just lands onto Mountain, and sits alongside it for the rest of eternity. Some of these items are references to previous works by O’Reilly.Early in my experience I was pleased to learn that pressing different keys caused a different musical note to play. If played in specific orders, those resembling main melodies to famous pieces of music, an effect will happen. The connection of the action done and the song is up for interpretation, and can be seen differently by different people. The combinations so far act as entertainment, but to each person his own analysis of the music.Besides musical tones played at the users command, there are ambient sounds to accompany the experience. Crickets at night and the sound of wind create a mood of relaxation and peace. This harmony is the true experience of peace for most of our lives, or to many, the external façade of peace, a mask of stress and pain. The calmness is almost surreal in this context.After a random amount of time, Mountain will end.The player can force it with the musical tone aforementioned, and a randomly generated object will collide with Mountain, ending it (It is said however, that with spamming musical notes, this can be avoided, almost as if we can postpone death with meaningless, or to some, meaningful, noise).Or Mountain will reach a more natural ending. And a message will appear describing the death of Mountain.The message can be natural, that Mountain was ruined by a passing sun.Other deaths are less natural, that I, Mountain, died to Rupert, The Bringer of Ice.In essence, Mountain is an experience, not a game.An Experience that is unique, special, and a reflection of who we are."

It's 0.99 € game that allows you to be a randomly generated mountain lost in space. Mountain generation is fueled by player's simple drawings. Once it's generated, Mountain basically allows players two different actions.The first one, the one you'll be enjoying a lot is waiting. Waiting and observing is at the game's core. As time passes, so will seasons, days and night. Soon enough, an idyllic mountain will become home to different random objects such as wall clocks, baseballs, traffic cones and high heel shoes. After some time, your mountain will start looking like a decorated Christmas tree.The other function is experimental piano. By using keyboard, you will be able to play up to 16 tones. Playing speeds up time, but if you play some of the traditional songs such as Marry Had A Little Lamb and Jingle Bells, you will unlock different secrets, and effects of those can be turned on and off.When you really don't get any story, directions and ideas, you tend to pursue your own. That part of human nature has been driving the video game revolution for so long. Telling stories. Experiencing. Feeling. Unfortunately, Mountain's lack of interactive tools doesn't allow you to do anything thought provoking beyond one hour of gameplay. As an experiment, I've seen better ones. As a screensaver, Mountain can suffice. As a philosophical digital experiment, go for Everything.***You have reached the end of a review.

So will you join me in this journey to become a true mountain?In all seriousness, all this game is, is you get an all around view of a mountain that is growing and changes during seasons, at least from what i've seen. Also, for some reason, the mountain grows pies and chairs and umbrellas. So thats cool I guess. This game looks like it might actually have a lot of content though. For just a game with a mountain, it looks like there are still a lot of things to see and discover. I don't know. I bought it because, why not I guess. It looks interesting, and random.

On the lowest settings (which I usually use since my computer isn't really a ""gaming"" computer), it almost looks like a watercolour painting that you can interact with.As I said before, gameplay is lacking. What isn't, in my opinion, is sound. Users can make music with the keyboard, and can play around with it to make or recreate little songs. Some specific songs give interesting effects or filters to the world, like raining blood or frogs, or even ""snowglobe mode.""I'd say it's a neat little program and deserves a place in anyone's library, especially if they enjoy just sitting around and watching things change around them.

It is as the title says....a Mountain, which is a god, a single great entity, and being that is finding a sense for itself and asking the basic questions beings ask themselves...why am I, who am I, am I alone, and so on. While this is happening, weather changes, day and night cycles, and random objects crash into its surface. You can use the keyboard to craft/play songs, many of which unlock various weather and artifact features, thoughts, and so on. I recommend leaving this game open and checking on it every so often to see what it is doing and has done while you were away.When you grow weary of it, you can destroy your mountain, wipe its surface clean, or whatever.This is something people should be experiencing.

I can appreciate a good art game like Dear Esther and Gone Home but at least there you had some level of agency. In this game you have gimmicks instead, such as raining frogs and raining hearts. I generated a new mountain several times and failed to see much of a difference between them.It feels more like an artistic statement than an artistic game, and while I don't mind artistic statements I'm not sure I like being charged so that somebody else can make one. If I just wanted to stare at something moving and growing I have a really nice hourglass that I got as a gift (I mean REALLY nice!) and I feel like I'd get just as much enjoyment watching that. In fact I just confirmed it. It moves at more than 20 frames per second, has better sound effects, and if a celestial body comes crashing down it won't look like someone attached a translucent red glass texture to a very low polygon sphere.So I can't recommend this artistic statement. It has some charm but that alone isn't enough. If you want to see my first impressions of this game, check out my video below.

,Recommended,313340,11845510,"Posted: 24 August, 2014",all,Synergy Silverr,"A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level. These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystem of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction and recreation, such as mountain climbing.The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia, whose summit is 8,849.868 m (29,035 ft) above mean sea level. The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m (69,459 ft).DefinitionThe Matterhorn, Swiss AlpsDôme du GoûterThere is no universally accepted definition of a mountain. Elevation, volume, relief, steepness, spacing and continuity have been used as criteria for defining a mountain. In the Oxford English Dictionary a mountain is defined as ""a natural elevation of the earth surface rising more or less abruptly from the surrounding level and attaining an altitude which, relatively to the adjacent elevation, is impressive or notable.""Whether a landform is called a mountain may depend on local usage. The highest point in San Francisco, California, is called Mount Davidson, notwithstanding its height of 300 m (980 ft), which makes it twenty feet short of the minimum for a mountain by American designations.[citation needed] Similarly, Mount Scott outside Lawton, Oklahoma is only 251 m (823 ft) from its base to its highest point. Whittow's Dictionary of Physical Geography states ""Some authorities regard eminences above 600 m (2,000 ft) as mountains, those below being referred to as hills.""In the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic, a mountain is usually defined as any summit at least 2,000 feet (or 610 metres) high, whilst the official United Kingdom government's definition of a mountain, for the purposes of access, is a summit of 600 metres or higher. In addition, some definitions also include a topographical prominence requirement, typically 100 or 500 feet (30 or 152 m). For a while, the US defined a mountain as being 1,000 feet (300 m) or taller. Any similar landform lower than this height was considered a hill. However, today, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) concludes that these terms do not have technical definitions in the US.The UN Environmental Programme's definition of ""mountainous environment"" includes any of the following:Elevation of at least 2,500 m (8,200 ft);Elevation of at least 1,500 m (4,900 ft), with a slope greater than 2 degrees;Elevation of at least 1,000 m (3,300 ft), with a slope greater than 5 degrees;Elevation of at least 300 m (980 ft), with a 300 m (980 ft) elevation range within 7 km (4.3 mi).Using these definitions, mountains cover 33% of Eurasia, 19% of South America, 24% of North America, and 14% of Africa. As a whole, 24% of the Earth's land mass is mountainous.GeologyMain articles: Mountain formation and List of mountain typesJeff Davis Peak seen from the glacier-carved summit of Wheeler Peak, NevadaThere are three main types of mountains: volcanic, fold, and block. All three types are formed from plate tectonics: when portions of the Earth's crust move, crumple, and dive. Compressional forces, isostatic uplift and intrusion of igneous matter forces surface rock upward, creating a landform higher than the surrounding features. The height of the feature makes it either a hill or, if higher and steeper, a mountain. Major mountains tend to occur in long linear arcs, indicating tectonic plate boundaries and activity.VolcanoesMain article: VolcanoGeological cross-section of Fuji volcanoVolcanoes are formed when a plate is pushed below another plate, or at a mid-ocean ridge or hotspot. At a depth of around 100 km, melting occurs in rock above the slab (due to the addition of water), and forms magma that reaches the surface. When the magma reaches the surface, it often builds a volcanic mountain, such as a shield volcano or a stratovolcano. Examples of volcanoes include Mount Fuji in Japan and Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. The magma does not have to reach the surface in order to create a mountain: magma that solidifies below ground can still form dome mountains, such as Navajo Mountain in the United States.Fold mountainsMain article: Fold mountainsFold mountains occur when two plates collide: shortening occurs along thrust faults and the crust is overthickened. Since the less dense continental crust ""floats"" on the denser mantle rocks beneath, the weight of any crustal material forced upward to form hills, plateaus or mountains must be balanced by the buoyancy force of a much greater volume forced downward into the mantle. Thus the continental crust is normally much thicker under mountains, compared to lower lying areas. Rock can fold either symmetrically or asymmetrically. The upfolds are anticlines and the downfolds are synclines: in asymmetric folding there may also be recumbent and overturned folds. The Jura Mountains are an example of fold mountains.Block mountainsMain article: Block mountainsThe Catskills are a dissected plateau.Block mountains are caused by faults in the crust: a seam where rocks can move past each other. When rocks on one side of a fault rise relative to the other, it can form a mountain. The uplifted blocks are block mountains or horsts. The intervening dropped blocks are termed graben: these can be small or form extensive rift valley systems. This form of landscape can be seen in East Africa, the Vosges, the Basin and Range province of Western North America and the Rhine valley. These areas often occur when the regional stress is extensional and the crust is thinned.ErosionMain article: ErosionDuring and following uplift, mountains are subjected to the agents of erosion (water, wind, ice and gravity) which gradually wear the uplifted area down. Erosion causes the surface of mountains to be younger than the rocks that form the mountains themselves. Glacial processes produce characteristic landforms, such as pyramidal peaks, knife-edge arêtes, and bowl-shaped cirques that can contain lakes. Plateau mountains, such as the Catskills, are formed from the erosion of an uplifted plateau.ClimateMain article: Alpine climateA mountain in Carbon County, UtahThe Rockies - Valley of the Ten PeaksClimate on mountains become colder at high elevations, due to the way that the sun heats the surface of the Earth. The sun warms the ground directly, while the greenhouse effect acts as a blanket, reflecting heat back towards the Earth that would otherwise be lost to space. The greenhouse effect thus keeps the air at low elevations warm. As elevation increases, there is less greenhouse effect, so the ambient temperature goes down."

I was not that kind of people who are good at making friends and a student in my class freaking hated me. He told everybody to isolated me just because that I was fat and my scores were bad. It was a stupid reason but students in my class thought that was funny so they started to isolated me. I pretended like I don't care about them so I went to school alone and left school alone. By the way I had a elder brother but he thought I am fat and nerd so he didn't wanna play with me.I was sad and I felt I was a loser. I even wanted to suicide. But nobody knows cause I always pretended I was a happy guy and I told my parents that I made a lot of friends in my school. But in fact, I cried after everybody went to sleep.After my freshman year in high school, we had 2 months of summer holiday so my parents sent me to a summer school which was located in a small town in England called Hastings. It was actually great because I went there with my father's friend's relates. In the camp I met a girl from Ukraine. She was beautiful, but I was just an fat and ugly boy and I didn't dare to talk to her. We were in different summer camps but our schedules was same (Which means we would meet everyday). I REALLY wanted to talk with her  but I was shy and I got no balls so I just pretended like I had never know her.But in the summer camp everybody treated me nice and I talked a lot to my friends. I became a out-going person after I went to the camp. It really changed my life. After the camp I thought "" I MUST LOSE SOME GOD DAMN WEIGHT"", so that I started to go to the gym and whenever I wanted to ""Take a rest"" or give up. I always inspired myself：“U freaking fat♥♥♥♥♥ stand up and keep working hard"". And the reason was quite immature:Ï wanna be a handsome and muscle man, then I'd just go and find the girl.I made it. Not only I became a guy with perfect body with strong muscle, also my GPA reached 3.9 and I went to a really nice university. At that time I bought this game, just like what I said in the beginning, I played it when I felt bad and when I think about my goddess. I really tho a lot of things, but finally I am now going great and two weeks ago, I went to Ukraine and I wanna find the girl.( I knew which block do she live, I didn't stalk her or what, I got these informations from her facebook.25/6, I will never forget this day. I went to Sumy, Ukraine and I took a taxi to the block she lives in. It was like 7 or 8 o' clock. I walked on the street and I saw a view that I'd never forget.She dressed like a sex worker and she was like waiting someone on the street. I saw a lot of girls who dressed almost the same as her. I knew what exactly was goin' on. She became a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.I knew that was her, she looked just like her photos on facebook.I went back to the hotel and I felt despair. I opened my computer and I saw Mountain, I clicked the client like what I did when I felt bad. I started to close my eyes and trynna calm down. Suddenly I heard a blare and I opened my eyes. I saw my mountain got destoried by meteorites just like my heart got tore apart when I saw my dream girl became a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥.Mountain isn't a normal game. It's more like epitome of my life.

A game is a form of play or sport, usually competitive, involving rules that is decided by skill, strength, or luck. Mountain involves none of these things. This should not detract from what it is and not everything developed with tools often used to make games needs to be a game.That aside, here is what you can expect from Mountain:When you launch it, you are asked to draw a few things on the screen with your mouse, to generate a random seed with which your mountain will be generated. After that, you will watch your mountain (a hunk of earth floating in outer space) spin slowly around. Sometimes the weather will change and foliage will change. Sometimes, an item will land on the mountain, like a ball, lollipop, jet engine, ladies shoes, or umbrella. Every so often, the mountain will say something to you, like ""I feel at one with the universe, tonight"".After a bunch of hours, something happens. I don't know what it is, because I fell asleep. When it hit about the 20th hour, it started making a ton of noise and went to a ""game over"" screen.Essentially, Mountain is what used to be considered a demo. A little program that someone would have distributed on a floppy disk for free -- or maybe sold for fifty cents at the local nicotine-filled hacker-computer-shop that we haven't seen much of since the mid 90s. It doesn't really do anything; you don't either. You just look at it until it stops. You can make the screen small and stick it in the corner of your screen, if you like.So, would I recommend it? I wouldn't say it is garbage, by any means. If it seems like something you might be interested in and you buy it with the understanding that there's no game involved and you wont' be doing anything, then it is hard to complain about it costing a dollar -- which is absolutely the right price for this tiny curiosity. Therefore, with those reservations, I'd give this a recommendation."

The deep thought process along with a blank page gave me an open mind ready to take in something. That something was the meaning of three simple words and then i expressed them with art onto my blank canvas. Afterwards my mountain erupted from seemingly... nothing. It was just there. It was all mine to control, not with controls, but with reason. I felt as if the blank pages that i had spread my deep thoughts on had emerged into something greater. Something self-sufficient. Something that knew where it was headed in the future. Trees began growing. Wind began blowing. Precipitation began falling from the universe around me. At first I was not sure, but now i know.. This mountain is my life, my heart, my soul. It is me taking a journey through the world alone.. just waiting for the next time i experience something greater.

As my hatred grew deeper and deeper for Mountain I once again initiated the annihilation sequence a s , z b this time with the intent of ending Mountain once and for all. The object of destruction was beautiful, a massive pulsating eye, it hungered for Mountain. I watched eagerly as the Eye approached, closer and closer it came. Ohhhh how happy I was to finally see Mountain pay, but then something happened. As the Eye was mere seconds away from ending Mountain as I knew Mountain, a single rogue item drifted on to my screen. A heart. I was astounded. Even after all the terrible hatred I vented at Mountain, Mountain loved me. I quickly mashed my keys in an effort to save Mountain and the screen went blank. Through a miracle I had managed to save Mountain. I do not know what happens if you let the object of destruction hit Mountain and I do not plan to find out, nor do I plan to ever see that wretched Eye again.

The game was not damaged after delivery, only a tiny little scratch on the backside, but I personally do not find it disturbing as it does NOT affect gameplay in any way.The packafe contains the game, forums and guides. Then I launched the game, not before having read through the license of agreement and notes for the safe use of this game carefully.The intro shows all companies involved in the making of this game. Luckily, the intro can be skipped upon pressing enter, this will save a lot of time in the future.The graphics are very good looking- thanks to the physic/graphic engine develoved just for this game. I myself disliked the strong effects at times, referring to the motion blur and lens flare, luckily it is possible to turn these effects off in the video option screen. The graphics can be ranked as ""Next-gen"" for sure.I've benchmarked this game on two different machines; one AMD and one intel/nVidia run each. It is a slight better performance on the AMD machines, but that might be just me.Unfortunately, the game did NOT support my Logitech G27 Steering wheel, so I had to stick to my Razer Deathadder 2015 Chroma and Savior gaming keyboard. This is a real bummer, looking at the fact I bought this Logitech G27 steering wheel just for the sake of enjoying ""Mountain"" even more.I will not talk much about the gameplay itself since I do not want to spoil anything, however I will talk about the mechanism the game works with.The playground is a open world, taking place on a mountain, based on surviving the difficulities of mother nature.It features a lot of variants on how the game can be completed. Please keep in mind that there is no real way of failing, however there is no way to achieve 100% either. Due to the missing challenge at occasions I found the game not too interesting at times, however I have enjoyed the gameplay so far.I myself think trying and finding out for yourself is the best way of knowing whether you like the game or not :)TL;DR: The game is a very challenging game, newbies will find themself helpless at times, but luckily there are many guides to read through to help out.Package and delivery: 9/10Graphics: 8/10Gameplay: 8/10Hardware compatibility: 7/10Overall: 8/10.I hope I could help you people out!"

Two, random occuring events will play out in which random items will crash into your mountion.   Three, its only 99 cents so why not buy it?   Four, the mountion has its own 'thoughts', so you have a virtual buddy who talks to you I guess.Overall, this is not a game, but more of an app that aims to relax and please.

Sounds are pleasing to the ears.EDIT:  As for April, 20th 2017, Mountain has had a rather sizeable update.

Simply put, it is a game that serves as a place for meditation and self-reflection. You can think of it as a substitute for that one place in your childhood that you always felt safe in.Not only is ""Mountain"" a game of self-reflection, it is a well thought out idea that, in my opinion, promotes setting time aside and devoting it to peaceful silence.Mountain is quite possibly one of the best VR games I have ever stumbled upon.

You expect, you question, you get hopeful, you get disapointed, you get inspired, but most importantly you think. The creator of Mountain specified that this game is best left running for you to occasionally check in on. I left mountain running for 6 hours while I did work.

Maybe not though, maybe it's touching on the cynicisms of life and time?Art is what makes people think. This interactive piece of art will let you poke at it all day and you'll never be satisfied with any conclusions you may create regarding its purpose. You will keep poking, keep wondering.

,Recommended,313340,12098397,"Posted: 14 September, 2014",all,BRAINDEAD,"A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level. These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystem of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction and recreation, such as mountain climbing.The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia, whose summit is 8,849.868 m (29,035 ft) above mean sea level. The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m (69,459 ft)."

It is basically a screen saver, except it feels alive.I started to feel attached to the mountain I had made, I even found out a way to remove junk from my mountain by throwing it off, or by playing a melody.

It's not hard to figure out if you will hate this or appreciate this. I was glad I got it.

You have a mountain which rotates and accumulates random objects (the first object to crash into my mountain was an umbrella -- wtf, how did an umbrella get into space is what I want to know).  On occasion, the mountain thinks very mountain-y thoughts, like ""I'm diggin' on this storm!"" or ""Hey wow this spooky night is the bomb!"" (paraphrased).  The player can pick up the random objects and set them down again (exciting).  Other than that, I'm not sure if this ""game"" does anything else -- well, there are the musical notes one can play which sound pretty nice when scrolled way out, so that's a thing.All in all -- I shouldn't like this ""game"", but I sorta do, but honestly as it is I can't recommend it.

Its rambling, yet deep thoughts only lend to its personality, and bolster my affection for it. The items we have accumulated are a testament to the trials and tribulations we have been through. The duets we have played are a requiem of our love, and make time seem ethereal. The only issue I have with it is that I think its only engaging in this relationship to take my cpu away from me.

I remember the day like it was yesterday, my wife had left me and I had nothing but a dollar, a laptop, and my Steam account. I drank so much back then, shot after shot, it did nothing. While drunk, I pulled out my phone and bought this game which is called Mountain. Once sober, I opened my computer to see that I used my last dollar to buy a stupid game. I was ashamed, this led to more drinking. It eventually led to more than the hard liquor. I stole Cocaine, Valium, and Vicodin. I was addicted. I didn't know what to do. I finally opened Mountain after a long line of Coke. Then it hit me. The game was speaking to me. Not literally, but almost telepathically.

76561198085349542,Recommended,313340,32829498,Posted: 26 June,all,BlueHaven,"Personally, I love this game, if you want to call it that. There's really very little to it:  you just open it, leave it be, and come back to it every once in awhile to see if your mountain has evolved, if anything has changed. It reminds me of those electronic pet games people used to play, except that your mountain doesn't require feeding or anything else from you.My favorite aspect of this game is the ambient sounds. If you zoom in on your mountain you can hear the peaceful weather sounds that come and go, such as rain, wind, thunder, etc. If you zoom out to space, you hear a continuous meditational ""OM"" sound. I often leave this up, just for the audio ambience, to help me relax and unwind while surfing the net or browsing Steam.By the way, you can interact with the mountain to a certain degree. Aside from being able to turn, rotate, and zoom, you can also interact with permanent items that eventually appear. For example, I now have a rake, shovel, and message in a bottle (3 hours in). I can tap on them, or pull them up and reposition them. Funnily enough, when you drop them, they sound like an immense asteroid hitting the earth. Also, I accidently flung the bottle out into deep space, never to return, though a new one eventually appeared (or the old one?).Aside from this, there are random philosophical 'thoughts' that appear occasionally, signaled by a tone. Some of them really make you think about your life.For adjustments, there's a settings menu, with a simple graphics low to high option, as well as the ability to turn sounds off/on, thoughts off/on, windowed/full options, and whether you want auto mode on/off.I only gave 50 cents for this, and consider it well worth it, especially for something so zen-like. Heck, I'd probably give up to $2, maybe even $2.50. I recommend buying it, but just remember it's not really a 'game' as such, so some people may find it a bit boring."

You don't really play it, aside from mashing keys to make songs and occasionally pressing the ""."" key to check in on the mountain. You leave it to run and see how things progress. But for me, at least, its kinda relaxing. Just seeing this mound of earth being drizzled over by whatever that day's weather maybe be it raining frogs or an asteroid shower feels soothing. This, and coupled with the soundtrack, feels good. It's only a buck at normal price, and a great break from all the hectic gameplay of the usual stuff I play.

This game is a decent experience, especially for the price. Its an idle game for the most part but there are several things that players can do to interact with the game. You leave this game alone running in the background while you do something else. I usually play this game while I'm downloading a bigger one.In the game you can press certain keys on your keyboard to play musical keys and if you play them in a certain sequence you can cause events to happen. One of these events includes summoning an apocalypse onto the mountain. You can then frantically spam your keyboard to play musical notes inorder to defend yourself from said apocalypse. Repeat several times over for some of the achievements.If you can't read whats above because you're a lazykcufjust read this pro and cons list:Pros:1. Over 24 hours of gameplay if you want all the achievements.2. A total of 31 aesthetic achievements available.3. It's less than one dollar.Cons:1. Zero to no action unless you summon a apocalypse.2.

While I'm falling asleep, in the shower, on a long car journey or simply on the toilet I like to think about the story of this game. There are many different decisions for you to make in this game leading to 7 possible endings.Multiplayer-All diamond SMGs now, working towards my shotguns, very unique gamemodes and killstreaks make for an exciting and different style of FPS. The devastator mech does seem to be a little OP and should be nerfed as it seemes to obliterate anything within range.Co-op missions-Over 50 different missions for you to try with up to four friends that can be replayed on 3 different  difficulties. The levelling system carries over from multiplayer (100 levels, 10 prestiges) each mission gives you around 100,00xp which can get you from level 1 to level 5 in one game but it's likely you won't complete a mission until you're at least level 30.Raid bosses- The raid bosses in this game are possibly my favourite part. They can take up to an hour if you trying them at the recommended level but rarely defeated unless you have a full lobby of prestige 6 or aboves. The final raid boss still is undefeated by me as I'm only presige 9, level 20. Getting pretty close though.Zombie survival-Most violent thing I have ever seen. Must be 18.In conclusion this game is incredibly violent but very enjoyable. I highly recommend that you buy it even if you're not normally into strategic first person shooters but I do have one more warning:strong sexual themes and constant nudity.99/10"

This is not the case at the moment.

Don't rush, you have to experience the surroundings to get clues about the story and move forward. Yeah it's a walking simulator but also a good thriller/detective story. Some clues are more obvious than others but in the end, if you reach the final point in the story, you will even get a help (literally).I can't really talk about the story because... there are so many questions. Also it's really easy to spoil everything. If you like movies/games where you left with several questions in the end and it's up to your interpretation what the story was about then I recommend this game because you will enjoy it.Also it's not a horror game even tho it has a cold and dark feeling.

You haven't to do someting and you should only enjoy the atmosphere. I don't think you are the mountain, you are the god of the mountain and can watch the mountain from every reach. It's not some you can make for hours, but when you like meditation, you will can enjoy this. Try to meditate without and with the mountain, but you will find out that it is hard to meditate without because you can't concentrate yourself. When you have a picture in youre brain you can concentrate better.And what is the aim of this. I will give you an answer.could you live a life without doing someting. and can you see the little happy things in live. Would you say a live only in one mountain where every thing happen again for 100 years is worthless. Or would you say it was the best time I ever had, because I understand whats important. And this is a good test about the own thinking can I really rest for a long time without thinking something. When you would have the choice between this live or the lonely life at the mountain what would you decide.and how must feel god, when he have to see the things again and again for ever. Did we learned someting or do we walk in a circle like the mountain. Or did we understand the mountain and the mountain will understand us.enough answer why the game is good and why does it needs a big history when you can create youre own thinking.Try this game before you go to sleep than you sleep very well (:"

The gameplay is next to none, it's deep and enriching and makes you want to come back for more every day. This, along with the sound design, which is top class, puts you into the world and your are instanly immersed in the lore and background of Mountain.This brings us to the story of Mountain. The writing team should be given countless awards for this masterpiece. You will cry, laugh, and jump for joy along the ride. Your drawings at the begining of the game may seem odd at first but they dramaticaly effect the gameplay as a whole and I was very impressed in seeing that unfold throughout the story I forged. Its less of a game more of an experience.And story is beautiful paired with the greatest voice acting I've ever seen, or heard, in a game. I expect the voice acting budget was giant and the game lives up the hype. I really enjoyed the hint of a sequel at the end of the game. I hope we can see Mountain II, and jump back into this amazing world. Once again, a perfect 12/10. We may be looking at the next Elder Scrolls.

Это не значит, что это «игра». Разработчики игры целенаправленно говорят об этом изначально: «Оставьте это открытым - оно предназначено для работы на периферии вашей жизни. Только взаимодействуйте с ним, когда вам хочется. Вы можете играть в гору, играя в другие игры. Если вы не играете Он, он будет играть сам. "". Снова гора просто означает оставаться открытой, и вы можете вернуться к ней, когда захотите. Возможно, вы не сразу заметите его внешний вид, но вы можете найти его позже ... надеюсь. Но опять же, каковы стандарты «игры»? Должны ли мы просто отделять гору просто потому, что это возможно вне нормы? Напротив! Различный опыт приводит к различным точкам зрения, которые делают вас более открытыми. Так могут люди действительно заявить, что Гора - не игра, а скринсейвер? Существует множество способов просмотра горы и ее просмотра, поскольку скринсейвер - одна из наиболее популярных деморализованных точек зрения, к которым многие так привыкли. Поэтому можно рассматривать гору просто как автономную, а не сравнивать ее с более современными проблемами. Или можно сравнить, но тем самым теряешь номинал самой игры. Я думаю, что теперь я решил, что эта «игра» может быть скринсейвером или просто не «игрой» вообще.С другой стороны, разработчики заявили следующее: «Если у вас неприятный шторм или скучная ночь, сыграйте мелодию (используя клавиатуру), и время ускорится». Гора там для вас, когда вы решите вернуться к ней и сыграть ее. Я думаю, что это распространенное заблуждение. Это не столько игра для вас, сколько вспомогательная и поддерживающая игра рядом с вами. Тем не менее, есть много способов увидеть Горы, как с любой формой проблемы в жизни. Но Путь Гора был построен, порой непривлекательный для глаз, позволяет ему показать вам другой путь и, возможно, тот, который вы, возможно, не видели раньше.Но вам не нужно следить за тем, что говорят разработчики. «Игра» должна воспроизводиться в зависимости от того, как вам это нравится. Если вы чувствуете, что вас обманули, купив эту игру, тогда сделайте два шага назад и подумайте об аспектах этой «игры» и элементов. Возможно, вы начинаете замечать замечательный окружающий звук, который играет среди ночи, или, может быть, вы влюблены в то, как полосы солнца касаются вашей Горы. Но вам может не понравиться все это, чтобы по-настоящему насладиться игрой. Возможно, у вас есть все эти игры, и у вас появилась любовь к игре. Или, может быть, вы пытаетесь насмехаться над игрой, но в свою очередь вы уже привыкли к игре. Я, например, не могу ответить на этот вопрос о том, понравится ли геймеру это или нет, но все зависит от того, кто его покупает, и готов ли он открыть свое сердце и ум.Теперь Гора действительно ваша гора и ваша собственная собственность? Я думаю, что в концепции только геймера для геймера можно составить представление о том, действительно ли Гора является само воплощением, или игрок действительно управляет Горой. Гора не говорит с нами и не рассказывает нам о ее мыслях? Или это передача скрытого сообщения туда, где мы могли бы быть его собственным порождением, и это - мастер. Каким бы способом вы не сочли нужным, существует достаточно много способов увидеть гору, как в любой игре. В горах может не быть сюжетной линии, не стрельбы, не любовного треугольника (если только вы не начнете что-то делать между вещами, Горой и небом, и в этом случае вы, возможно, пошли слишком далеко), но в Горе есть Момент одиночества, в котором вы можете заметить вещи в играх, которые могут повторяться в горах. Возможно, Гора может содержать все эти элементы, в которых вы создаете историю. Гора всегда может быть сюжетной линией, в которой вы, геймер, идете по дорожке с Горой к месту назначения в ваше подсознание. В горах многое предстоит сделать, и ваше воображение будет блокировано, а логика только помешает этому. Но если вы так решите сделать это, вы не обидели никого, кроме себя, в отрицании возможных сил в самой игре. Этот обзор не может показать мой нейтралитет по отношению к игре, но я только хочу объяснить геймеру, что гора может быть акцентирована только игроком."

You build your mountain by drawing three random things from a list. The mountain generates and you watch it spin. Seasons pass and the mountain changes. You can play music while watching the mountain do it's thing. Playing certain music allows for things to happen. You can make fish rain down or a mystical glowing light destroy the mountain. For 99cents I suggest anyone who is a true fan of games should pic this up.

I have spent hours after hours with this game and I have loved every second of it.Mountain has unparallel storytelling that immerses you into the highly detailed story. You will surely spend hours just admiring the complex but interesting storytelling. I'm guessing that it is written by really talented writers and it has taken a long time.The voice acting in this game sounds really natural and it fits really well into the theme of the game.The graphical quality is top-notch, but you can easily get reasonable framerates with an older CPU and GPU.  I would definitely recommend playing in 4K for maximum enjoyment. The audio quality is eargasmic when listening in 7.1 or even 5.1 surround sound systems.Would definitely recommend trying Oculus Rift and if you like using a controller, no worries since this game has it covered.The multiplayer is something you should try, but I feel like it has some polishing.

That's how Mountain looked like at first but look closer and you will see all the trees, rocks and flowers growing around it. And isn't life just like that? We often neglect things that we already have.We sometimes feel stuck, with nothing good happening in our life. Every day is the same as the day before it. That's how Mountain is like as well if you just keep staring at it. But go back to it an hour or so later and you may be surprised to find a giant dice has landed on it. Doesn't life surprise us much in the same way as well?And the mountain's incline? It represents the challenges that we have to overcome to reach the peak of our potential. Often it may seem unreachable, just like how the peak of Mountain is usually covered in clouds. But at the perfect moment, the clouds pass by and you can see the beautiful future ahead of you.If you zoom out far enough, you can see Mountain covered in bright light, and the entire universe surrounding it. This implies how small we are at life and that there is an entire universe out there to explore and experience.

That's because Mountain is an interactive screensaver. Nothing more, nothing less, even if the genres on its Steam store page incorrectly label it as a 'simulation' and 'RPG'. Mountain does attempt to foster actual interaction by allowing you to play musical notes on your keyboard which when a correct sequence is played (Hot Cross Buns, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, etc), you can cause various effects to rain down on your mountain, like hearts, fireballs or in morbid manner, blood. These effects are only visual, unfortunately, and gameplay in Mountain doesn't improve from there. You can use your mouse to look around your mountain, spin it or zoom in and out for a closer and more distant look, and cleverly enough you can briskly shake your mountain to clear away clouds if you want a clear look at your personal piece of rock (despite the trees and other textures looking incredibly poor). Oh, random space debris will also fly in and crash into your mountain, like a traffic cone, a child's toy block, a futuristic sphere and other oddities that you can then move around or throw away. Why? Video games!Mountain falls apart at the seams once you realize you've exhausted these gameplay elements (and I use that term loosely), since the only progression in the game is the passing of time, the weather and seasons in your little bubble of an atmosphere, since zooming out will reveal your mountain is floating in space for reasons I still can't figure out. Apparently your mountain has emotions and sentience, since every few minutes it will make an observation or statement about the current weather, time of day and how it feels, even if during the night it will claim to be nervous one minute, and then another claim it feels bold from the darkness. Another 'thought' your mountain can have is some kind of existential question or statement regarding its existence, why its out here in space, if the player is a voice inside its head, why is it alone, are there other mountains like it, etc. and so forth (you can also press period to force one of these thoughts if yo﻿u don't want to wait). Apparently this is what has attracted players and journalists to the game, supposedly eliciting emotions and 'feels' from your mountain having a crisis of its own sentience and having to cope and adapt with the bizarre circumstances it finds itself in while 'living' day by day, season by season.﻿The glaring flaw in trying to stir thoughts in the player this way is that Mountain is still a screensaver. Nothing more, nothing less. I've tried to find something positive to say about Mountain, but excluding being able to shake your mountain to clear the clouds being clever, I have nothing. Mountain feels like it's trying to be something unique, but it ends up looking utterly ridiculous and full of itself in the process, and the fact that it carries a price tag doesn't help its case. Yes, ninety-nine cents is a piddly amount which could easily be raised by selling Steam cards, but charging money for screensaver under the guise of an 'ambient procedural mountain game' is an absolute joke, where the punch-line is on the consumer.In no way can I recommend Mountain, even at the price of being a penny shy of a dollar. It is a waste of time, money and patience from the four hours I burned away on this game, trying to make sense of it and realize what the positive talk of it was about.﻿"

As all things are, this game is completely relative to your opinion. (Believe me, this game will arouse a strong opinion.) I consider it more of an art project than a video game. There's no purpose or controls, just the Mountain.You draw images based on the queue of the Mountain. Based on these images, your Mountain is decorated in odd objects. Strange philosophical sayings cross the screen periodically, and these are to represent the thoughts and feelings of your Mountain. Confused yet?I typically let it run while I am asleep. I get the suurprise, and sometimes horror, of what has crashed into my Mountain during the night. Once again, don't expect a traditional ""video game"", but more a ""video game-esque"" art project."

Some people dont like this game, these people are stupid and dont realize that a minimalist calm time game for such a low price can be entertaining (they usually dont even give the game more than a few minutes to prove itself), these people are heathens and should not deter you from spending a measly dollar on a calming game like this."

Then you start to wonder, why are you just a mountain? Where is the rest of your plantet? Why are there so many houshold items floating around in an unescapable abyss? Is this a sign of what is to come? Then you realize that it's up to you to rebuild the beutiful plantet that was once your home.

,Recommended,313340,11786266,"Posted: 19 August, 2014",all,pliable,"First off, if you see any review that has a playtime of less than an hour, ignore it because it's more than likely a child crying in impotent rage about how ""dis game dum"" simply because their feeble brain can't handle a concept like this.With that being said, this isn't a game in the traditional sense. If you're expecting exxxtreme mountain action, well, you won't find any. I think calling it a game is rather inaccurate but, that's still okay.However, this is still a pretty neato piece of work. When you start the program, it presents words or questions to you and then has you draw something. The drawings are used as seeds to generate your mountain, to make each mountain unique.The idea is to just leave it running all the time, and you check on it whenever you want. I leave it minimized or off to the side, and then just completely disable the noise if I'm going to play another video game. The ambient noise the program makes is also very pleasant for general computer tasks. You can control the type of ambient noise by zooming in or out of your mountain, to get rainy/windy noises to a tao/zen like sound for outer space.As you check your mountain, you'll find more and more items piling up on it. As of this writing (and leaving it running for 12 hours), I've got a clock, a top-hat, a barbell, a biplane, and a cement brick. You can interact with these by clicking on the object and holding it down, and you can either toss it back out to space or redrop it somewhere else on the mountain.Various things will grow as well, and so far I've got various kinds of oakish and pine type trees going. You'll also get different kinds of weather going as well, depending on however the hell your mountain feels.There will be an audio cue at random, at which point a ""thought"" will pop up. The thoughts oddly put a smile on my face :). You can provoke ""thoughts"" as well by hitting '.' (the period key).So in summary, it's a really weird concept at first, but the key really is to just leave it running all the time.

You can also, for some reason, play music with your keyboard. I can't imagine a better way to spend your time than playing happy version of Freezing Moon to your mountain. Unfortunately there's no grass in this game so I can't combine this realistic experience with my favorite hobby; watching the grass grow. Hopefully we'll get a grass DLC soon!This game also has a psychological test when you start to play. I in fact had to rely on a walkthrough to be able to pass this part of the game. I really like this feature - keeps adhd kids away from the game.The roleplay feel in this game is immersive! You can identify yourself as whatever mountain you want to be! Stone mountain? Sure!

Actually, I don't even think i could even call it a game at all. Calling it a game would suggest some sort of gameplay, some sort of meaningful interaction, something to do... all things this ""game"" almost entirely lacks. 99% of this ""game"" consists of just staring at a floating mountain as it slowly rotates. Yeah, that's it. It's about as interesting as it sounds. I've seen a lot of people praising this game as something innovative or something that challenges what a game is. Don't get me wrong, there are some games out there that are doing just that... this is not one of them.The game starts with you being given a vague subject and you draw out a little picture based on that. As far as I know it goes into seeding the RNG that creates the mountain. It doesn't really matter what you draw but it's probably the most interesting part of the game. After that you are shown your mountain. It just sits there slowly spinning as it changes from day to night and the seasons change. Every little bit some text will pop up and once in a great while some random object will land on you mountain. All you can do is wait, you can zoom in and out or rotate the mountain, you can play musical notes with the keyboard, and you can pick up the objects and drop them back down on the mountain. That's about all there is to it. Sounds like a lot of fun, eh?Mountain might be somewhat redeemed if it actually looked good. If the graphics were even decent it might make a good screen saver but sadly they are not. The graphics are poor and I have problems with textures flickering and such. It's just not that pretty to look at. The dev also recommends that it's something to leave running while you do other things but it's so poorly optimized that it uses much more resources that in should for what it is... So much more that some people have suggested that it could be a Bitcoin miner in disguise, lol. There's no reason to believe that but the fact is that it's a bit heavy for something that's meant to be running it the background.If you are looking for something to blow a dollar on there are definitely better things you could get."

You willl feel like this is your mountain because you see it age through it's own bubble in the universe. What I do reccomend is a surround sound headset or surround sound sterio. If you use a sterio that is surround sound and you turn off your lights and just listen...and watch you will feel comfortable and at peace. Now listing to this review (reading) you will think that i'm describing the feeling of what every parent will say about going out side, but my friend what i'm saying is how you will feel like you are outside, this game truly shows what DEV's are capable of doing and what a real life game simulator can be. Every once and a while you will be notifide by a sound that will say something at the top of your screen. But to really feel better about this game make sure that you have a pure black backround and that no other colours are showing because this game does not have a full screen mode that I know of ATM, if you do please comment on my profiles review page :). One really quick thing that I would like to say is that you can scroll out and you will see this bubble that I was talking about ealier and also every so often click and drag your mouse around so you can look about and under the mountain................................................................................But let me just stop talking, buy this game, get comfortable and play"

The game looks great graphics card is kind of demanding for what it is but if the graphics card is a realy good one then your all good for some sweet graphics. Next question and the last,What are the flaws of the game mountain? Ok so i have some flaw dissapointments i would love to see in this game like wildlife and harvesting for mother nature but the flaw of this is the seasons they move to fast but the game does not end so good but it just moves so fast like its summer then beofre you know it its winter and well thats it so over all i give this game a thumbs up a 9/10 so buy now and enjoy the peaceful cycle of a mountain everybody have fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

,Not Recommended,313340,13277874,"Posted: 7 December, 2014",all,Wilson,"Mountain.TL:DR+Beautiful Soundscape and ambience. Keyboard makes a lovely mock piano.+ The space background upon zooming out is nifty, although it doesn't move or change.- Quite literally no interaction in-game.- CPU hog.- Fairly ugly; looks at the very least 10 years out of date, made more noticable because it is TRYING to look good.- The same seasons doing the same things on rotation.- Only at the most three types of vegitation, with a handful of trees to each. Mostly a Ctrl C Ctrl V job all round.- Awful shadow mapping issues - Many textures simply become a mess of flickering black lines.- In the few hours I've had my mountain open, nothing has changed. No extra trees, no life - if all there is to see is the mountain at night or with a snowcap, why would I leave it open? Why would I bother saving it?- Is a prime example that a minimalistic game cannot simply get by on the gimmick of 'exceedingly simple'.Maybe I simply haven't 'played' it enough. Maybe I just don't get it; which is odd, considering minimalistic games can be something I appreciate. Mountain is an aquired taste, one I wouldn't have tried if it wasn't for its nomination at the Game Awards the other day. Having enjoyed games like Proteus, Dear Esther and to an extent Sword and Sworcery, I thought I might like this, but there is a slew of reasons why I'm unable to.Unfortunately, this 'Video Game' is all 'video' and no 'game'. There are no controls at all, and past the little Brain Training doodle boxes at the beginning of the 'generation' the only interaction you will have with the Mountain explicitly is zooming in and out and wazzing it around from side to side. Besides this, the bottom two rows of keys on your keyboard act as a mock piano, allowing you to create some beautiful minor soundscapes of your own.The ambience of the wind and the twinkle of the piano is actually the game's strongest point, and the only one I would award credit for. Clearly, they want you to feel something with this Mountain, but the sounds very quickly become the only thing to which you have any connection. The Mountain (mine atleast) was practically barren, and barely changed noticably at all in the two hours I had it open (it is still running as I type) except a few dustings of snow as seasons shifted and an extra spatter of orange in Autumn. The only thing of note that happened was the appearance of a skull. Devoid of context and completely out of place, it simply floated there with the rest of the pointless immobile objects until it snowed again.From a technical standpoint, the feelings you should have toward this natural structure simply fall further. The horrendous geometry, poor texture work, shoddy repeating trees, small size, lack of colour variation, inability to zoom in close enough to inspect properly and crappy lightshafts make the game in its entirety feel and look like a loading screen from a game released 12 years ago, huge Xbox-style, and drag you back out of whatever 'experience' you should be having. Not good at all, considering the light could have aided it.Finally, I also made note of a post regarding Mountain that stated you should simply 'leave it open', which is all well and good but the app is quite a CPU hog, warming up my i5 4670K 3.8GHz a fair amount, spiking a lot, and having a load similar to Alien Isolation or GTA 4. Why? Furthermore, with the 'keep it running' philosophy being emphasised by the ability to swap to smaller windowed modes quickly on the fly I'm surprised to see that the 4:3 windows it chooses actually chop off text that occasionally appears in the top-left of the game screen. Yet something else that doesn't even work as intended.I would have LOVED to see more varied foliage, better geometry, and perhaps even to pull at the humanity it is obviously tying to reach for have a little creature or two, maybe a tiny cabin in those copy-paste trees, anything that would make you stop and look for more than ten seconds (and honestly I thought this was what I was buying). I wouldn't want Banished - Don't Touch Us We're On a Mountain edition or anything too extensive civilisation-wise, but it this game wished to play at simplicity, then simplicity across a wider range of landscape and visual tools would have been to its aid, ENORMOUSLY. Even for 99p I cannot recommend this; its an ugly background processor warmer with no redeeming qualities except the sound. The only other potential positive I could draw from it is that it has exponential potential, and I'd check in on it every few months, but I feel I say that in vain as the dev's seem to be in the completely wrong frame of mind for what most people want."

But after fiddling around with it for several hours, I had to give up.The game failed for me because it failed in it's primary function: it wasn't beautiful. When you've got a game that's little more than a glorified screensaver, it has to deliver aesthetically. And I couldn't really enjoy my mountain when it's got random objects being hurled at it every hour or so. A pickaxe? A bed? After a few hours my mountain felt more like a junkyard. TL;DR I would have been much more pleased with a mountain that randomly generated plant growth and rudimentary animal life than...whatever this was. I'm not going to gripe about the cost, since at 99 cents I DID get my money's worth, but I wouldn't go back for more either."

It is truly a CPU hog and I have no idea why such a simple game can use so much of your CPU. It defeats the purpose of leaving it running in the background. Not only is this an issue, but the ""game"" itself is an issue. What, exactly, is the point of this game? People claim it's art, but people don't get that games can't be ""art"" in the sense of a painting. Sure, you can draw a few black lines on a white background and call yourself an ""artist"", but you can't do so with a game because people pay for a game and they expect to get something out of a game. You don't get anything out of a painting except for your own thoughts and you don't pay to see the painting either. This game is like a painting with a few black stripes.

The game will also spout cryptic one liners here and there to keep you on your toes.If I had to find an equivalence somewhere it would be the tree of wisdom in Plants VS Zombies.Conclusion: Overall with the limited interaction both at creation, and afterwards that this software has with the player it would not really qualify as a game, so it is kind of a short lived curiosity piece that ends up cluttering the library"

It's more of an experimental project. I love this sort of thing, and I couldn't recommend it more. It's full of pleasing little events and is quite artistic in a way. The only reason to be upset about it is if you didn't actually read any description of it. It never pretends to be something it's not, and for $.99, it's definitely worth the price.

You have to see it for yourself.What it does have is aroun 50 hours of 'gameplay', if you can call it that way.Rating:4/10I wouldn't recommend the game. You can't really call it a game. There is not much to do, besides playing some songs and look at your mountain with random items on it, but it's still very relaxing. Relaxing, but only for a couple of minutes. One of the worst features is actually the fact that you have to keep the game on (afk) to receive items on your mountain, but is it really worth to wait? No."

If you enjoy looking at something beautiful and the emotional representation of this, then I would say $1 is a nice supporting price to pay for this kind of thing. After awhile random objects like anvils and soccer balls will show up that you can move around, but nothing else really happened, except changing weather. You can play your mountain tunes using the keyboard that act like basic piano notes, and the mountain will send a soft single note to let you know it's going to say something in writing on the top left of the screen. It can be interpreted as the changes in you or emotions that you can experience.This product is definitely not for everyone and some people will be confused by it or angry at the limited interactions, while others will find it beautiful and calming, enjoying the presence of the little mountain in the background of their computer.Pros:- Beautiful- Music and sound effects are calming, beautiful, and simple- Relaxing and emotional- Only $1- there are very subtle interactions that are really calmingCons:- Very limited interactions, it would be nice if you could sculpt your mountain or move the trees around- Most people will not like this game, as it is more art than a game.I am recommending this to you if you are an art person or somebody who enjoys relaxing sound effects and beautiful things, otherwise, I would recommend not buying this as you will most likely just be disappointed.If you like these types of things, I would suggest it be an 7.5/10, if you do not like these types of games, I would say a 1/10, it is hard to give a rating too."

Mountain is marketed as a Mountain Simulator. No controls what so ever. I wanted to like this game but theres a lot of reason why you shouldnt even bother with it. This is a screen Saver and not a game. All you have on youre screen is a mountain and things happen on it. You can spin it around but thats all you can do. For 99 cents i wish there was more to it because so far you shouldnt buy it. The game looks nice and thats about it. Writing this review i dont have nothing to say about it. Overall Mountain is not a game its a screen saver. Stuff does happen on the mountain but its barely visable. If you have 99 cents and you dont know where to spend it than go right ahead and buy it. But For those who want a full expierence from a gameSkip this. I give Mountain a 1/10

Occasionally,  indie games such as this do not give you options, just because of how simple it is *cough* The Plan *cough*. My computer is not exactly cutting edge so I was able to apprecieate this game almost as much as other people with the fancy new 800 series. This game has some really great features. I am able to watch my mountain as it progresses through life. Seeing every angle. I think this game is actuall superior to being a real mountain because you can actually see what is going on underneath a mountain. This is not something you could just do in everyday life. You also get neat features that give a nice roleplayin vibe during the mountain generating sequence. You are able to choose lineage among other things. I love hearing the thoughts of my mountain. It makes me start to question what mountains think about IRL. Do they feel joy, anger, depression, boredom or love? These emotions are there. In the form of weather. When it snows on this mountain, you FEEL his cold and, to an extent, lonliness. It makes me start to question what really is a mountain? Are they really just elevated land? Or something more? Something with a soul? This  game makes me question my previously negative stance on mountains. I shouldn't go into detail, but I was unfair to them. All it took was some understanding and observation to realize that mountains are people too.I give it an 8/10It would be 10/10 but it needs multiplayer of some sort. I hope the developers get this message because I want to play this game at a LAN party. Coop would be nice BUT I think competitive multiplayer would be sweet.

But they don't appreciate it.Mountain is something you have on whenever you just want to chill. You can read, pet your dog, relax, watch your mountain, take a deep breath, and just relax. It's worth the dollar if you have had a long and tough day and just want to mellow out.If you're expecting a game in the traditional sense, then don't buy it.

I was incomplete, a person born into the wrong body and unable to come to terms with myself as a human being. Who am I? What am I doing with my life? What is all this even for? These questions gnawed at me, eating me away from the inside until I was hollow and thinking I couldn't live with myself anymore.Then I played Mountain.I realized what was missing from my life, there was a cavernous hole in my psyche in the shape of a mountain. A chunk of myself spinning in the void, disconnected and fragmented, completely without purpose. I watched as it slowly rotated, each angle subtly different, like a babe beneath a jingling plush mobile I was mesmerized.What am I doing? I pondered as a placidly watched the seasons pass me by, weathering me down, making me smoother, gentler, capable only of idly commenting on the notion of time and how something so indifferent to my existence can affect me so greatly. Has this face changed since the last time I gazed upon it? Its creases and angles seemed inherently familiar, yet the pattern of life across its surface strangely foreign each time I see it anew. I was always getting older, spinning in place as life moved on around me, embedding me with memories of a life once lived, leaving me with impressions, pieces of the world around me, seemingly random and yet unshakable.Where am I? Lost in an endless and empty vacuum, suspended in a spherical prison pieced together from the materials of living matter I've sorted and categorized to be able to comprehend as existence. Unable to see beyond it to greater meaning. Unable to feel the difference between moving through space and space moving through me. I cannot fathom a reason for my being, why I ended up one place and not another, if I am alone through action or if I am made alone in my awareness of self.Who am I? I knew there was more beneath the surface, if only I could dig my nails into that crust, pull at its crumbling edges and explore what skeletal frame held up this facade, knowing... Nay, praying, that there was something more to me than this ponderous slope of earthen matter. Something to express in more than a few staggered notes, something greater than the deafening silence. But no matter what I grasped at, what extrusion I prodded or angle I explored, I was faced with nothing but the naked truth of myself:I am Mountain.TL;DR 6/10 - Most hipster screensaver ever."

You will experience the calm, serene life cycle of a lone mountain caught somewhere in the vastness of space. Anything goes in this no-holds barred life experience and every playthrough will have a unique spin to it. By the end of the game you'll be questioning both the very being of your life as well as the fabric of the universe. ""Why am I here? What is my purpose? Where do we go when we die? Why is the universe so vast when we cannot even explore it? Who is the true creator of everything?""

You can also play what sounds like piano keys with your keyboard which is fun.- The DepthCurrently I have an alien spaceship, a giant cube with grooves on it, and snow all over my mountain. Other things can happen and its a joy and shock when they do.I dislike:- The lack of more things. (There are a lot of things -- I just want even more things to be in the game.)Although I have probably yet to experience all possible things I still believe that there could be more things. Not sure why, but I suspect it.- The GraphicsBy god the godrays are cool. They do a fantastic job with the snow on mountain, and all my items look cool. I have a problem with the actual mountain though. If the textures were just a bit cooler looking graphics would be in the positive.Conclusion:From the experience I've had so far I give the game a 9/10 for it's uniqueness and outrageously amazing price point. You get so much for a dollar. I am excited to see what mountain will bring me in the future and I implore anyone reading this to buy it."

It is also not a screensaver. It slots in with many other games that let you play a bit, then you leave it for a bit. The best example I can give is the Virtual Villagers series. You play a bit, you leave it to let your villagers grow. Then you return, get an update, play a little more, go back to normal life.Modern games keep you fixated on the screen way too long. This breaks that rule and is much respected by me for doing so.Yes it's not perfect. But for £1? Can you expect perfection? If it could be made so that it's not as memory intensive, it would no longer have any negative aspects. The only negative aspect is the attitude of the people who buy it unknowingly.That was going to be the end, but whilst I was writing this review, I got a little update on my mountans thoughts and aquired a new object to add to the collection: a little black hatchback. This is how it should be played. And to all you haters who are here to moan at a lack of a game: I have no time for you."

Your mountain floats in space, whilst other, much more boring mountains, are earth or planet bound. you can glare into the vastness of a space skybox and listen to your mountain say small things every 3ish minutes and watch things crash into your mountain, making it unique.

This is not a high-action packed game of excitement and joy.  No.  This is a game of waiting and, if you can see behind your tears, occasionally there will be an object that hits your mountain.  If anything, this is more a screensaver than a game.  You scroll out, in, possibly watch an object crash into your mountain, and play notes, (C-to-C,) on the ASD and ZXC lines of your keyboard.  That's it.However, for one easy-earned dollar, all this can be yours.  I say it's worth it.  What do you say?

Most of this game is staring at a rotating mound of dirt.

Every once in a while the mountain speaks and may say something ranging from potentially deep to banal; assorted surreal space debris hits the mountain every once in a while adding to its character. As time goes on the mountain evolves into something quite different from what you first saw after inspiring its creation with shaky-lined cursor paint, and it continues to grow even then.For one American dollar, pet mountain simulator will give you this.

I know, it sounds exciting already, but the best is still to come.You can play a piano. That's right, read that sentence again. You can play a piano. I put it here again so you can read it a third time. Your keyboard enables you to play a piano, and it's literally the most exciting thing I've ever done.I poured hours into this game (this does not show on my steam account because of reasons). Literally days, and this is where it all went wrong for me.I live in a house with my Mother, Father and Two dogs. Sadly, while playing this game and excitedly trying out all the different keys I could use to play the piano, I failed to hear my Mother shout as she fell down the stairs. She broke both of her legs and stayed there all day. When my Dad returned home, he tripped over her unconcious body and also broke his legs. At this point I was mastering Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, having finished all of his other symphonies. I did not hear them shouting for help.The days came and went, the mail piled up on my doormat and the milk went bad outside the door. Eventually, after two months my neighbour came around to check on us, and roused me from my waking coma. I stepped downstairs and found that sadly my dogs had gone without food and taken to eating my parents. They had developed a taste for human flesh, and had already killed my neighbour, and had begun feasting on her.I left them to it, as I'd been out for a few minutes and missed playing Mountain, and continued playing for a few more weeks until my electricity was shut off. I then went downstairs, fought off my dogs with a toaster and made some soup and am now waiting to die. I am typing this with 19% battery left on my phone, as I could not find a laptop with enough charge to play more Mountain.Overall, I'd give this game a solid 11/10 for gameplay, however owing to it's addictive qualities which led to the early demise of both my parents, our concerned neighbour and my two beloved Dogs, I have had to lower this figure to a more conservative 8/10."

The mountian changes while you sleep and the objects are mostly different when you wake up.I really like having it around, kind of like an aquarium or a fireplace. It's nice background and you can wiggle stuff when you want. This is not a game to play to keep you busy, it's a game to play while your doing something else like working or sleeping or even cleaning. The keyboard aspect is fun if you need a little distraction and I make up little songs on it all the time when I can't sleep. For a dollar this is a great addition to a collection of intense games if you want a break between games or a way to wind down. Really lovely ambient game just like it says."

,Recommended,313340,11864866,"Posted: 25 August, 2014",all,WolfEcho,"This is a long, but completely honest and unbiased review, if your considering buying mountain, read this first.First, the reviewers and reporters who made such a big fuss about this game, both good and bad, are turds. Take it for what it is, its a small time no-to-low budget game. Its not life changing, its not exactly special, its just unique because nobody else has thought of making a mountain the focus of a game before. Its not a new genre of game, its not going to cause a huge shift in the industry (damn I hope it won't, shooters will turn into an episode of the simpsons).Yes its pretty much a screensaver like everyone claims, because its not really an interactive game, you just sit and look at it (probably why reporters made such a huge fuss about it, had to be the high point of their day...). I do hope that improvements will be made to it, I'd consider mountain to be in beta state still because its lacking some basic features like being able to start a new game. It has potential to be better then it is, but that would mean adding a few levels of interactive features. How about subtle things like affecting the weather or events that change the shape of the mountain, the plantlife, the items on it, maybe even add some animals or stick men? The simulation idea is nice but its progressing way too slowly for me, consider adding a speed switch on how fast changes take place maybe?The people who complain about spending their one dollar, what else were you going to do with it anyway? buy a pack of chips or bottle of coke? Big freakin deal, you spent one dollar to pay for a game you can't create on your own without weeks of training, no matter how bad you think it is, at least have a little bit of respect for someone else's work.In conclusion, Mountain is a nice start to a game that you can leave on while your busy with other things around the house, its pleasant to look at on max quality settings even if its not the sharpest textures out there, but it needs improvement and additional input from the creator to make it a great small background game. It needs something to keep you interested for more then just a few hours."

I tried to open my eyes, slowly, and I saw a gigantic pyramid dashing to my Mountain. The music, man... The music was scary. My screen started flickering, and as I was kinda still sleeping, it felt as like some kind of spirit had entered my computer and was haunting it, just to kill my dear little mountain. As the bloody pyramid came closer and closer, the screen started to turn red, while still flickering, then... Then... A flash. An explosion. Then, the silence. My mountain was destroyed, killed, annihilated, by the bloody pyramid.20/10.Actually, I wasn't aware of such a thing, I didn't know we could ""lose"".

You don't know what to do until it says draw something.Connections are made. You realize it's making you draw an abstract concept.Does it do anything? Who knows. Maybe it's a metaphor.Then it draws you a mountain.It draws you.You do what anybody else would do. You click on it. It stops. You drag it left. It spins faster to the left. You drag it right. It spins to the right. You scroll for fun. The camera zooms in and out accordingly.Suddnely, a sound. A wonky chord, played upon a piano.The mountain says something. Was it you? Did you do anything? The answer is no. You didn't do anything. The mountain has thoughts. It thinks.Later, a few presses of your keyboard reveal that certain keys produce musical notes, and that there's even one to make the mountain speak, to think. This isn't the natural way of things. The mountain thinks, speaks on it's own terms. It feels forced otherwise.After playing around with the notes for a bit, you feel adventerous. What happens if you play these notes? What happens if that song plays? What happens, if for no reason at all, you decide to play that five note tune fromClose Encounters?Maybe it's best you don't right this instant. A time for everything, and such.Then a loud noise, and a shake of the camera. What happened? What is it?You search the mountain for any clues. Then you see it.A giant rubber duck.It's right there, buried face-first in the side of your mountain. You can't see it from the front to confirm it's a rubber duck, but there's nothing else that's quite got that shape.So you click on it. Maybe there's a rubber duck noise. Maybe not. Nothing much happens. So you click it and hold it.It shakes. It pops out of the mountain. In shock, you let go of the mouse. It flies back into the mountain. It makes you chuckle.The mountain keeps thinking, keeps spinning, just doing it's thing.Then you remember theClose Encounterssong-tune-thing. You plunk out the keys badly enough to figure it out, then prepare to play the thing for real.The final note rings out. A giant red eye appears out from nowhere and comes ever closer to your mountain. The tense music begins, growing ever louder as the eye gets ever closer.And then it reaches the mountain. The eye destroys your mountain. The thing that ou didn't work at all for.And you feel a loss.And then you start again."

I don't see this as a game but a simulation or a piece of iteractive software (like how some people have characters that live on their desktop).I'm going to point out why I like Mountain.Firstly - With sound blocking headphones on the ambience of the game is amazing and you can choose to have the sound play while minimized.Secondly - The world around your mountain is influenced by what you do. The more and faster you play the piano the faster the mountain spins causing the days to go by quicker. Spinning the camera causes the wind to remove the clouds and interact with raining objects.Thirdly - There are a lot of hidden things in this 'game' to find with your piano keyboard.Forth - It's only 1 dollar... I enjoy having it open while I am working on things.TLDR:The shaders seem to glitch every now and then which is a downside but a part from that I find it interesting for a dollar. If you are expecting this game to something that will blow your mind or be marked on gaming history as the next thing it wont, and why should it?. It's a nice zen 'game' to have open while you work."

,Recommended,313340,11803665,"Posted: 21 August, 2014",all,Xariann,"As a game I should really downvote this. But there are enough reviews here to show that this isn't really a game, so since we already established that, I am going to review this for what it is, an intriguing piece of art. I am an art lover, and as such I find this interesting.The concept of a lonely mountain that goes through changes, comments on its existance, has reactions and so on is just a really good concept. It lives up to the creators of Her.You kind of wonder if this mountain at some point is going to become so evolved that it will go away to a ""higher place"" with the other Mountains. And you know that this isn't going to happen, that obviously this isn't as complex as the ficticious AI OS starring in Her. But your mind goes places, and then your attention is brought back to the Mountain, even as I type this, as the sound of dawn chimes.You are there going about your business, doing your own thing, and so is Mountain. So why blame Mountain for living its own life? Yet unsuspecting that you can turn it off at any time, only to resume from where it left off the next time you turn it on.But you could ask, are we also all unaware of some higher power that is watching us from a computer screen while we go about our lives?You'll probably say, ""You are crazy, of course we are not.""Yet all I have been trying to do here is to embrace and show what kind of concept Mountain really is. At least my artistic interpretation. Look elsewhere if you want a game, but if you want a piece of art, a silent ""companion"" then you might want to spend the little money it costs. If not, nobody forces you to buy this, you keep going about your business and play the games you enjoy, just as Mountain goes about its own.P.S.: If you really don't like your Mountain, you can always ""as,zb"""

Few controls, a spinning mountain.Then I started reading the reviews and thought ""maybe I should do the same as these people"" and started naming a rock Sam. After some minutes I already forgot which rock was Sam.But after ~15 to 20 minutes a group of three fir trees came to my eye and I came to like them. They grew on a kind of bare side of the mountain and I don't know why, but I was happy they were a group of three so that no one of them was alone. By now there are more trees, and I'm slowly entering the autumn season.A table crashed into the top of my mountain. I can only see two legs of it. I don't care about him, since he left my group of trees in peace.The mountain just asked ""where do I come from?"" and my first thought was ""sorry, that's my fault""."
