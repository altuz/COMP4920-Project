I never got stuck or spent long trying to figure out what to do at most points. I liked it, it's good.http://youtu.be/5GaX9p87oEkIt basically plays like a like point and click adventure game. I worked out the solutions to most situations pretty quickly. They are usually fairly obvious and there weren’t really many red herrings or that sort of thing.I liked the aesthetics, the characters, the music. There is virtually no sound, just rain pattering down sometimes. There is no voice acting, all dialogue is written. But I really liked the it. I thought the world populated with androids was cool. The plot was interesting even though the premise was cliche, waking up with no memories. There was an interesting twist at the end.Okay, what's available now is a pretty short. But once all the episodes and vignettes are available I think you could probably get a decent amount of game-time for your money. It's not really expensive anyway, I felt like it was already worth it. I am looking forward to episode 2 and 3.Clickherefor my YouTube gaming channel"

Meanwhile, I've seen about 10 different scenes in a cartoonish style, telling the story in typical bubbles. I've solved two major puzzles (cracking a door lock terminal and setting together a recording with soundclips) that took about five minutes to figure out and accomplish each. There are only a few animations, sometimes the game just feels like looking into a picture book - and that in turn seems rather unlively.The soundtrack sounds quite decent to me, but no accents at all. There's no voice acting or material sounds either, and the music gets repititive after half an hour.So far, that's a big minus for atmosphere. But what about the story? Maybe it is able to compensate the lack of it, at least a bit?Well, for me, it does not. You don't learn much about the character you're playing. Circumstances are: You're awakening from cryostasis, world has changed, one big company to rule it all, no more humans but lot of androids populating the city/world. An underground union planing an uprising that you are joining. You want to know who you are. But the way the game tries to keep you motivated, creates tension, introduces characters - it just doesnt work well. The world simply does not seem credible - I think that is the closest word  I can describe it with.The game has to improve a lot in my opinion, in all areas - the state the game is in at the moment, I'm not looking forward to playing episodes 2 & 3."

The end of this episode includes a nice little twist and leaves you curious about how the story will unfold.Note that this is NOT a classical point-and-click adventure. No overflowing inventory or stupid combine-those-items-to-use-them-in-a-ridiculous-way things. ""Motion comic"" is an accurate description imo. This kind of presentation fits the story perfectly, supported by an awesome soundtrack which really sucks you into this world.You can play in your own pace and the checkpoints are not too far away from each other. Usually I prefer free saves, but the game isn't too long and there are no complicated actions to perform so here I'm okay with checkpoints.If you like comics / graphic novels, visual novels and / or a good story, PLAY THIS GAME.  For the hesitating ones: there's a demo available on the store page."

There is a long delay when changing locations.The game is quite huge, about 1 GB. However, it is only text and images. WTF.Voice acting would be great.The Act 1 is ridiculously short, the gameplay mechanics are ridiculously simple.Althoug the game isn't really bad, But in the meantime, I recommand players (and developers) to play e.g. Gemini Rue to remind themselves what the term ""high quality adventure game"" means. The Maker's eden has potential, but it IMO needs some major interface and design adjustments to exploit it."

I love the fact there are multiple choices in dialogue. I like the art style, it could be better, but it could be a lot worse as well, plus it has its own flavor. All in all, the game is a good purchace even when not on sale. I'm looking forward to the third and final installment."

I also enjoyed the semi-3D environments that move with the mouse. It is more like a visual novel than an adventure game, but it’s a nice way to spend a little less than an hour. For the most part you just have to click on anything that’s clickable in any order to make the story progress; there is very little difficulty.The story is short and quite raw and unrealistic (random strangers trust and help you almost immediately), but not uninteresting. Very little happens in Act 1.Due to its very short length I recommend buying it on sale. Act 2 is supposed to finally be released this month, but even if it adds another hour it will still be a short game."
76561198054291418,Recommended,313360,21987528,"Posted: 22 March, 2016",all,Ellaliini,"A game with beautiful art and music, a surprisingly interesting story with some pretty good and funny dialogue, well-written characters and interesting ideas. It took me only 2 hours to play Acts 1 and 2, but it's definitely worth the price and I plan to play it again when the third act finally comes (probably a year from now). You will take longer if you stop to admire the art in more detail, soak in the atmosphere and listen to the music. The puzzles are not terribly challenging, so that cuts the play time short as well.There are a few minor technical issues: if you exit to Windows for whatever reason, the music may stop playing and it won't restart until you restart the game. Occasionally text is cut and only partially visible but you can still make out what it is supposed to read. In the bar scene, you have a conversation option available when it shouldn't yet be, but you can guess that you shouldn't pick that one yet and it won't ruin anything. Moreover, the dialogue could have been proofread more thoroughly, as I spotted a few missing or incorrect words, but overall the dialogue and texts are very well written.I don't have the heart to fault the game for these small issues when the overall experience is so pleasant and inspiring. You will like this if you like scifi/cyberpunk stories, beautiful art and atmospheric music. And you can always wait until the final Act is released and it won't feel so short."

If the art and soundtrack is appealing to you, maybe you should buy it and wait to see whether there would even be a sequel. But considering how unpolished the plot and dialogues in this game is, I doubt act 2 is getting any better."

NOT AN ACTUAL GAME.After playing the super short, but highly stylized demo I was sold. The futuristic film noir vibe was right up my alley. The illustrations were futuristic & mysteriously beautiful, yet somber. The storyline was intriguing enough to hold my attention from interesting puzzle to puzzle. The writing, acceptable & the last few puzzles all seemed very promissing... Like there would be so much more in the full game. So I chalked the super short demo up to the Devs not wanting to ruin the story's mystique & I immediately purchased the game.I justified justified spending $10 on an unfinished indie game because of the promise of 3 full episodes & that seemed WELL worth it at the time. WELL, IT'S NOT WORTH IT. Not unless you wait for ACT 3 to come out (maybe 2019? LOL) & it's on sale but seriously- not enough content & too much time between episodes for the price. smh1. BOTH episodes are TOO SHORT (ep1 Puzzles/Story/Ok ep2 30min of reading, 0 Puzzles)2. Ep2 is just a 'DIALOGUE SIMULATOR' with no real puzzles or choices. Not fun.3. Waiting 2 years for 30mins of reading?? W..... T...... F........4. SAVE YOUR MONEY, this is maaaybe worth $2 but never worth $10.I'm never buying anything from these DEV's again. #unprofessional"

I love the comic-like storytelling and it's a wonderfully crafted world that has been created.For only 5.99GBP, this is a cheap fulfilling game that is sadly still incomplete though is still being worked and is not abandoned.My only gripes would be the duration between acts, but of course there is only I believe a small team not all full time working on this game so it is understandable.Lastly would be the usually minor bugs, aspect ratio issues, UI being cut off, sound bugs.It's only a real big impact is when the sound stops all together or when the UI has cut off in a way that you can no longer proceed.Overall though at the price it is being sold at I love the game! How I can tell? I've gone out of my way to write this review AND submit bug reports.The game and characters while sometimes basic are intriguing and captivating and this is what has brought me back time and time again to play it.EDIT: I will agree that some voice acting or voice sounds even could be a nice addition."

,Recommended,313360,18092529,"Posted: 18 September, 2015",all,Kelsah,"Episode 1:I've played through the whole Chapter 1 in one sitting. You play as 905, someone who doesn't know what or who they are, and why you are being hunted down. The game play is simple point and click- but the story really draws you in, giving you little information at a time.The graphics are not terrible, but I was expecting more. The game is marketed as a motion comic, but I beg to differ. It's got some of the black frames and dialog boxes but still lacks in a true comic book style feel. It shys away from really reaching that graphic feel that it needs. There needs to be more reference in the direction. What are they going for?  Is it concept art? Is it sketch-y? Is it graphic? Is it rendered? I'm not sure. It's a mishmosh between styles and it looks poor. The only good design choices are the several perspective shots (that are repeated with differnt environents may I add, some variations would be nice), and the color pallette. Even the intimate moments with memorable characters are tossed aside frame panel to panel in quality. I'd expect more of a final design when I'm speaking to a character. It seems that the art style is unresolved and needs refinment for the next two chapters.Tossing art direction aside, this game does a great job with its characters. They're memorable in their own ways and it's interesting to see how they interact with you with various dialouge trees ( I love me some dialogue trees). Each character molds well into the world. Without spoiling any of the storyline, I'm just going to say that I'm very excited to see how the other chapters unfold with them.Overrall, the gameplay is super catchy. Like I noted before, the story really draws you in without giving you much of a bone when you get more information. Good games work because of interesting storylines and gameplay. Graphics wouldn't make this type of game more fun, but an upgrade would really help to make this game stand on it's own even more."
,Recommended,313360,11538286,"Posted: 3 August, 2014",all,TheDietCokeofEvil,"a respectable first outing from Screwy Lightbulb.Cons: it's a bit short, but that's at least partly because it's only the first episode out so far.The puzzles/interactions could be a bit more complex/challenging.Pros: It's a good story, loaded with style. I'm very much looking forward to learning more about the characters and the world.The artwork is well done, especially the scenery/locations. Very moody. Likewise the music.All in all, I enjoyed playing it, and I'm looking forward to learning more about the characters and the world. This is a game that focuses on storytelling, rather than in-depth interactivity, so if you're big on shooty stuff, or complex branching dialogue or skill trees, maybe it's not for you. But if you like interactive storytelling, you might want to pick it up. It's fun."

The graphics and OST is good quality. The price is rather high for that kind of experince for only act 1. But when act 2 and 3 will come out (free of charge) - we will see. I liked it.

The puzzles aren't too difficult but the writing, art, and worldbuilding is superb. While only the first act (plus a few side-stories) is currently avalible, the developer is showing consistent evidence of progress, and it looks like the second act is coming soon.This is a good buy if you're a fan of easy adventure games where the point is the actual adventure, not the puzzles.I would only caution you that the developer is working on this project part-time, so while progress is being made, it might be a while for the series to be completed."
