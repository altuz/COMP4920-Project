,Recommended,313390,32486554,Posted: 16 June,all,kirtanloorii,"Not bad at all! Basically, this is an arcade game where you battle wave after wave of enemy forces until you either get killed, or you get tired, lol. I like to think of game as being Ace Combat lite. In many ways, the gameplay feels like Ace Combat. You carry way more weapons and any fighter jet can possible carry, but that only means that you get the satisfaction of wiping out entire nations (it seems).It is the sort of game you can jump right into. There are two modes you can choose from: Anti-Air and Anti-Ship. Anti-Air has you battling wave after wave of enemy fighters while anti-ship has you taking out enemy destroyers.  AA gives you a greater challenge while AS is more relaxed, allowing you a bit more stress-free gameplay as it is hard to lose.Another thing you might notice is that the game has lots of achievements, mostly for just playing the game. You might like that if achievement hunting is your thing. At full price, this game costs about $5, but I've seen it even lower than that during sales. It is absolutely worth it. In fact, I would have paid $15 for this as I just love Ace Combat-style games. You won't regret getting this game.Note: I played with an Xbox controller. I don't know what keyboard gameplay is like."

Then you might want to give this one a try. (Be wary, the gamepad controls are by default in Japanese; Circle to confirm and Cross to exit)From the image I got following Project ICKX's YouTube Channel for more than a year, Vertical Strike was originally intended to be a mod for Raiders Sphere, just like many Japanese-exclusive direct-to-discs Raiders Sphere mods in the Japanese PC market. Kinda explains the similarity in UI and gameplay, huh? This one's the first to be officially sold abroad though.It plays almost like Raiders Sphere, with HAWX/Vector Strike's ""AoA Limiter Off Mode"" added in and Ace Combat's ""weight"" in flying mechanics. Weapon loadout are customizable just like Raiders Sphere, though they may not offer much if you're accustomed to arcade flight games.The game's still barebones, though. Only an Su-33 type for air targets, a Japanese Destroyer and a Russian Modern Battleship/Cruiser for the sea targets. Selectable planes only include an F-22A with canards and an ATD-X/F-3 Shinshin. They'll probably only give you 15~20 minutes of fun until the endless wave of enemies bore you out.If you're a flight game afficionado like me and willing to pay to help boost the Japanese indies confidence in Steam (or for more better flight arcade games), give this one a try. Just be wary that it won't get deep, and the price has set that in stone."

As the description says, there are two gamemodes: Anti-Ship and Anti-Air.  The former pits you against ships and eventually enemy aircraft.  The latter is just Aircraft.  What makes this game particularly fun is the ability to disable the Angle of Attack Limiter, which allows you to perform maneuvers that should be impossible for a fixed wing plane to do.  The game does fall short in a few areas, mainly the fact that it has only two flyable aircraft and only one type of enemy plane.  It has a very arcadey feel to it, by which I mean it seems like something you might find in an arcade.  It's cheap too, so if you like games such as Ace Combat I'd suggest you get this.  For those that prefer a list of pros and cons, I'll provide one:Pros:+Cheap Price+Wide arsenal of ordenance+Nice Graphics+Lots of Achievements+Toggleable AoA.  Toggling it off allows you to do absolutely insane maneuvers.+Suprising amount of replayability.Cons:-Lack of Aircraft.  There are only two.  One is the FSX-something or other, the other is an F-22.  As for enemies there's only the SU-33.  Unfortunately you can't fly it.-Lack of gamemodes.  Your options are ""Anti-ship"" and ""Anti-Air"".  Both are endless, so there's no real goal other than surviving.-Barren maps.  There's no real scenery to speak of on the maps other than the terrain.  Honestly, that's not an issue for me."

On seeing the recommendations for it as a clone of the Ace Combat gameplay I decided to give it a go and while that is accurate, there's just nothing else to the game aside from dog fighting above a featureless terrain which quickly gets quite dull leaving the game to feel like an early alpha release to show the gameplay."
,Recommended,313390,32149127,Posted: 3 June,all,MiracleAttack,"**If you love the Ace Combat series and need your fix on PC-- grab this game. It is excellent for 5 bucks.**Cut and dry arcade-style air combat. There is a great assortment of weapons which make hunting all the achievements fairly entertaining since you are forced to change up your playstyle. However, it's easy to 100% this game if you set out to do it.I would love to see future updates with more misson and aircraft variety, but I would not consider this a con due to the price and the amount of entertainment you get out of the game in its current state."
,Recommended,313390,31517680,Posted: 2 May,all,Aquila13,"Fly beyond the limit, and take the Air-Dominance backVertical Strike is one of AC-style indie game which I like a lot. Arcadish control and maneuver, plenty of armaments, decent graphics(uses Unity-based VSEV engine, thanks @YumenoJMD), everything AC fans could imagine. Of course there are similar games such as Vector Thrust, but this one has a lot of potential and almost flawless perfection for sure.So, do I recommend it?The game is really polished, and price is reasonable as well, so why wouldn't I play it?Too obvious, but I'd say YES."
76561198048099412,Recommended,313390,32076467,Posted: 30 May,all,Fox_Quantum,"So, I played one round and decided I had to write a review immediately.This is a really excellent dogfighting game. If what you want is to just fly a combat jet and dogfight, this is the game you should buy. There's no story, no extra frills, no nonsense. It is perfect in its simplicity.Gameplay is pretty straightforward - waves of increasing numbers of enemies. You get reloaded in-air after every few waves (if you survive). There's no fuel limit and an endless sky, so you can just keep flying forever.A gamepad or joystick is really necessary to play this correctly. The flight controls feel very responsive with my Logitech F310 (nothing fancy or expensive), and I suspect if you've invested in a really nice set of flight controllers this game will work very well.The controls are fully customizable, so you can set up your flight axes and buttons to whatever you're most comfortable with, and there are sensitivity adjusters for the axes and for the buttons (which is an uncommon and appreciated level of control).Some features that would be really nice additions:- More interesting ground terrain (canyons or mountains or cities to fly around/over would be cool)- More aircraft options (there are only two right now)- PvP dogfighting (though I assume that would be complicated)This is definitely worth adding to your library, especially for $5."

,Recommended,313390,32052643,Posted: 29 May,all,𝓙ajka,"Picked this up on sale cuz I was looking for something arcadey like Ace Combat. Gameplay is pretty fun. You fly around without a care about things like G-Force and firewall the hell out of your jet while shooting down bandits with AIM-120's. Music is pretty repetitive though and there really doesn't seem to be any voice acting either which is probably expected of an indie game like this. There isn't a story mode or campaign or anything like that so gameplay is split into modes of defeating wave after wave of enemy aircraft or naval vessels. I'm playing with a Logitech controller and the default controls are a bit odd but it's nothing that can't be managed with a bit of setting tweaking. Not sure why the ""simulator"" tag is on the product though. It's not anything at all like a flight sim. Buy it if you like Ace Combat and feeling like an unstoppable ace pilot, not because you're looking for a flight sim."
,Recommended,313390,31577950,Posted: 6 May,all,Commissar Laiton,"This game is fun, especially if you like achievements. There's a lot of achievements. For the love of GOD the first time you play this game, you'll unlock at least ten.Apart from that, VSEC is good fun for $5. Two planes, two modes, a decent spread of weaponry to use - I can't wait to see what's added later on."

,Recommended,313390,33234048,Posted: 4 July,all,Mindslash - the Belmont,"Not bad game, at all. Its really short, low amount of customization and planes, but it really reminds ace combat a bit, which is very good. If had missions , workshop/mod support and additional/unlockable  planes/equips, it would be far better. My rating to this is 6/10 . Still I recomend it."

76561198060243785,Recommended,313390,33093099,Posted: 1 July,all,Chief1924,"Pretty fun game, I'd say worth the $5 (though I got it on sale). As it is, it's very good for what it's supposed to be, that is, an arcadey jet combat game. Shooting down a bunch of planes with missiles is fun. However, my only gripe with this game is that I don't know if it will be updated anytime soon, if ever. In other words, I don't know if they'll add at least a splitscreen function for multiplayer coop or competitive. Nevertheless, though I have only played a little (I have other Summer Sale games to play, too), I would recommend this game for anyone that likes this kind of thing or if they want an arcadey experience. I would give it 4 out of 5 in that I don't feel it is complete without at least splitscreen, but it is still very enjoyable. Thumbs up."

,Not Recommended,313390,33491095,Posted: 12 July,all,GOZAR,"Controller support is buggy and broken. Does this game not recognize Xbox One controllers? I can only get my 360 controller to work, and even then I have to try to trick the game into recognizing it. To get it to work I have to start the game with the controller plugged in, then switch the control options to keyboard only, and then restart the game, and only then can I use the controller (but not the one I want to). I'm asking for a refund, because this game is unplayable with a mouse and keyboard, and I'm not doing all of that every time I want to play the game.I really want to play this game but controller support is so profoundly broken. I tried reinstalling the game, even when I get the 360 controller to work, only the D-pad works. Confirmed controllers work with everything else, I'm a hardware tester for a living. It's not the controllers."

,Not Recommended,313390,34317133,Posted: 17 August,all,Crooked Hillary (Trader),"This is one of the worst games i ever played by FAR, and here's why.GAMEPLAYThe controls are awful, one of the worst up is down and down is up it's really hard to get used to you half to spend at least 2 hours figuring out how to control it well. The controls are stiff and almost unplayable even with the controler!!  Another thing to about the controls there is no tutorial so you half to figure it out on your own and you half to play it with a control because for one none of the fire keys work on the keyboard so you half to hook up an xbox/ps4 controler or buy one!! Even simply navigating through menu is hard even with the controler it's like balancing a plate on a horse!! Lastly the graphics is like, no even worse than microsoft flight simulator from the 2000's.CONCLUSIONLike i said before it is one of the worst games i had ever played. Do not buy this game it's a waste of money time and resources. even if it was free i wouldn't want to buy it."
