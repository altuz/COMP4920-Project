The central ""gimmick"" here is that you can rotate the battlefield through 360 degrees to evade bullets and concentrate firepower etc. Whilst this seems like a simple idea, in practice it is one of the most inventful, unique and genuinley challenging shmups I've played for maybe 20 years. Grab it for less than a fiver if you like old skool shooters. If you don't (you should) then buy it anyway."
,Recommended,313400,12627356,"Posted: 25 October, 2014",all,Hobbes,"Fast, blue, stylish and clean. Ikaruga's wilder, more futuristic cousin I think. That's a good place to start when discussing RE:ACTOR. From Cross Eaglet, this bullet hell shmup takes a simple premise and adds a unique mechanic, instead of polarity, you're dealing with rotation. The field of play can be rotated along a 360 degree axis around your ship. In effect, you're flying through a ""cylinder"" as opposed to a flat playfield as is often the case, with enemies swirling all around you, and the landscape forming a three dimensional tube that often branches and splits, with numerous junctions appearing that will allow you to choose your route (this offers -immense- replayability as you high score hunt or figure out new routes through various stages).As you rotate the field of view, the bullets also rotate, so a near impossible field to navigate suddenly becomes a flat line that's easy to dodge, and all of a sudden the game forces you to think in three dimensions, with objects often coming at you from ""depth"" as well as from the top, sides, front and back. It would be a bit easy to lose track were it not for the utterly gorgeous aesthetic which keeps things simple and easy to keep track of. Everything is presented in a washed out, futuristic neon blue, clean lines and clear presentation keep the game running at a flawless 60fps no matter what you're doing, with everything maxed out on my rig the game looks nothing short of artistic (Oh god please let there be an occulus rift option down the line).As is the norm for such japanese bullet hell games, the music is energetic, electronic and upbeat, it maintains a strong pace and a good sense of place, but isn't exactly going to reach the heady heights that Ikaruga managed (but then nothing is ever going to manage the soundscape of Ikaruga, let's be fair). It's good enough though, as is the sound effects, which do the job with satisfying explosions and gun noises, everything sounds correct, which is really all that needs to be said. You don't buy these games for the sound, but it's good to see that Cross Eaglet got everything lined up and the sound presentation is clearly up to spec.What makes this game stand out is the rotational mechanic, which is nothing short of inspired, it imposes a learning curve, and with an Xbox or PS pad, you'll be wise to map it to the shoulder buttons, but after half an hour of getting used to it, you'll be swooping back and forth like a pro, and the game opens up, once you make it past the opening stage, you'll then find junctions everywhere, and you'll be able to navigate through a gorgeous cityscape.It's hard, as any good bullet hell should be, but it's worth every second of your attention, offering visual and gameplay delights as you duck and weave your way through a constant barrage of firepower. Each boss makes full use of the rotation mechanic too, forcing you to quickly improvise and adjust to the constant incoming flak that they toss your way, and within a few goes, rotating will be second nature, you may even look at other bullet hells and feel a little... lacking... when you try to change perspective and find you can't.At this price, it's an absolute steal as well, for what you are paying for, you're getting one of the best experiences since Ikaruga, if you're a fan of the shmup genre, this is an easy sell, if you're new to the genre, getting this and Ikaruga should be high on your priority list. Both of these games are well worth your attention."

I happened to see it on the store front and checked out the video - at that point I knew the game was for me!The game's unique gameplay mechanic is to rotate the world around your ship and this is exploited brilliantly to chain enemies and avoid walls of bullets.  I wouldn't describe the game as bullet hell, but more like a Cave shooter; there are plenty of bullets for sure, but every single one of them is there to be used to increase your multiplier.  Although you only get a single life, the game isn't so punishingly hard that you can't progress a few levels with some practice, but like any good shooter you can choose the risky play styles which could net you much more points at the expense of progress.Graphically the game has a unique look to it, very reminiscent of the demoscene product ""cdak"" by Quite and Orange.  On level three things get shaken up a bit which is welcomed at that point.  Musically this game is incredible, covering a wide range of styles but remaining high quality throughout, and the soundtrack is right there in the game folder.A fantastic game then and one that I'm sure I'll keep replaying not just for the score but for the sheer enjoyment of it.9/10"

The gameplay is fun without falling into bullet-hell masturbation, and being able to revolve the screen adds a really exciting mechanic to this style of game and it designs for it pretty well. On top of it, it's a very solid & responsive feeling shootemup.The downsides are that the graphical style makes it hard to understand what's going on at certain times (nothing too frustrating, but certainly dont' expect to pick everything up on the first play), and there could stand to be a better introduction to the revolving mechanic opposed to throwing you straight into the fire.

,Recommended,313400,17519573,"Posted: 13 August, 2015",all,lob☆lob,"Revolver 360 is an STG (or ""Shmup"") that is innovative in its mechanics whilst remaining respectful to the classics and fundamentals of the genre. To summarise, Revolver 360 is a 2.5D STG taking place in 4 stages, with branching paths and bosses at the end of each level. The player shoots enemies and objects coming from all directions in a 3D plane whilst moving within a rotatable cylindrical playing field. Bullets can be rotated-around and cancelled through abilities which use up constantly-recharging resources. The scoring system is based around cancelling bullets and enemy chaining (although the chaining is not nearly as strict as games like Dodonpachi, which is notorious for its perfection-demanding enemy chaining). There are also 50 short challenge levels which test the player's knowledge of the different game mechanics, as well as their memorisation.As someone who usually plays STGs for survival and tends not to care about getting high scores, the scoring system in Revolver 360 is so addictive that it has gotten me hooked and trying to improve my scores regularly in spite of my preferences for survival play.The scoring system is based around two multipliers: a first multiplier which is based on chaining enemy destruction, it is capped at X16, although this limit can temporarily be broken through using overdrive mode; the second multiplier is a count of how many bullets you have cancelled. Bullets are cancelled through destroying enemies as they are firing lasers, using your ship's own lasers, or using the emp shot (a powerful charge shot which breaks through blue beams which lasers cannot cancel) and overdrive, which cancels all bullets on screen once activated. Larger enemies fire more bullets at lower health, so the player has to be careful to leave them on as little health as possible to cancel as many bullets as possible. The effect this has on the gameplay is that it encourages players to be constantly taking risks, as it requires them to rotate clouds of bullets directly towards them to cancel them out with a well-timed/positioned laser cancel. The nature of the first multiplier encourages players to mix up their main shot (which works as you would expect from a basic STG shot type) and their laser for the most optimal chaining. This combined with the fact that there are many routes to take throughout the meticulously-crafted and gorgeous levels (there are even secret routes!) means that there is a ton of player freedom and replay value."

It is gorgeous in its gameplay and most definitely in its graphics.I have a mediocre laptop, so I'm surprised I could run such a detailed and vibrant game.You're a small futuristic ship I guess, and you have the standard attacks you'd find in any side-scrolling bullet hell (well, not THAT many bullets, but still) shooter, like a normal dual laser shot, a bigger laser, an EMP, and a freakin' Overdrive that I still don't understand what it does b/c I didn't bother to read the manual (it's in the main menu after you finish configuring, choosing a name, and achieving the first achievement just for buying the game, sweet!).basically they let you change bullets into points and increase your multiplier so you can have like billions of points OH BOYThe rotation mechanism is very interesting. What you see on your screen is not always the whole picture. There's enemies in the background, as well as ZOMG HUGE ASTEROIDS AND SPACE JUNK (and other crates that can help your ship but those aren't too frequent). So, how do you destroy these things if you can't see them at present? You rotate thorugh your 360 degree field of view, of course! That way, even though you're looking at your ship and the approaching enemies from the side, you can also blast background objects and enemies away, whether they're above or below you! It's a fascinating concept that really sets this game apart and makes it that much more enjoyable.You really should get this game if you enjoy a challenge. It is a challenge, honestly. Not that you'll die all the time, of course. But y'know, you could just have rotated through the 3D space to avoid that humongous helicopter's laser.Okay, whatever, just get the game already, it's breathtaking! No joke!"

Get it.Long version: I'm so happy there are more and more Japanese games appearing on Steam. Sure, some of them are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dating sims but there are lots of gems still not released on the platform. Playism has been delivering (and translating, I believe) Japanese indie games for a while now through their site. Some of them make their way to Steam and they're always very well ported: there are always proper resolution config, control options and such. Revolver360 looks great, supports up to 4K resolutions (16:10 option is hidden under F10 key but that's a minor thing) and of course runs at 60FPS.Revolver360 has been praised in shmup circles and rightfully so. It's a great take on the genre with 2D plane you can rotate to avoid bullets or find secrets in the background - see the trailer, it explains the basics pretty well. The game's as hardcore as you can get which is the main draw for me. This wouldn't matter if the mechanics weren't fun, of course, but they surely are. I only wish the game would use more colors as it's blue on blue for the most part but that's a design decision and who am I to teach the devs. The tutorial is hidden somewhat in the challenge mode, be sure to try that before trying to clear the main mode."

THIS GAME IS AWESOME!REVOLVER360 RE:ACTOR is a shoot'em up game; but it has a very interesting difference from other games in this genre: you can rotate the enviroment!For example, you can use this ability to line up several rows of enemies and destroy them at once or to avoid screen filling attacks. This ability also made the game a lot challenging since the enemies and some goodies are placed around the enviroment. In addition to this ability, you have access to a straight laser attack which can eliminate enemies and some projectiles, and an overdrive move which removes every projectile from the screen.There are three modes to play in this game. I recommend completing the challenges before playing through Reactor mode to learn the basics.Positive Points:- The enviroment rotation mechanic is very innovative and has made the game unique- Multiple paths in stages- Nice difficulty (The game is hard at first. But when you get used to the mechanics it becomes easier.)- Nice visuals and soundtracks (Soundtracks are bundled with the game.)Negative Points:- TOO MUCH BLUE COLOUR!Notes:- The game can freeze on launch due to one reason: downloading scoreboards. To avoid this, check ((Offline Mode)) in game's config file which is in the game's main directory.- I haven't finished the game, so it's early to tell the game is short or not.

I love them, I have a passion for them, but I'm not spectacular at them. This game makes me feel like I'm a professional anyway. You will slowly learn the game as you continue practicing it, figuring out ways to make seemingly impossible attacks become trivial. You will watch yourself destroy massive hulking behemoths of nightmarish blue metal and you will feel invincible.I often watch replays of top players just to watch the backgrounds, just to see the details in the landscapes that I'm otherwise not paying attention to.

One of the great things about this game is that it is very approachable for all skill levels.  In fact, I actually cleared this game (there are no continues, so every clear is a 1cc), which is a first for me as I have never cleared a shmup without using a continue (terrible thing to have to admit, I know).  It only took a few practice runs of the 2nd and 3rd stages, and a couple replays that I watched from the leaderboards to achieve this too.  However, there is alot more difficulty and depth in the scoring, plus numerous challenges to satisfy you after you have gotten that first clear.  In addition, each stage has multiple routes, some of which require conditions to unlock, so the stages have alot of replayability.  My favorite way to play this game is just practice one stage, experimenting with different routes and rotating in different areas to shift bullets for better scoring, or to find more items or destructible objects.From the video and screenshots you can see that the graphics are very unique and original, and quite good too.  The first time you play this game, make sure you try the challenges first.  The beginning ones are what actually teach you to play the game.The rotating mechanic is also very original.  It feels like you are actually changing the shape and pattern of the enemy bullets and I think this game is worth playing just for experiencing this neat new system alone."

,Recommended,313400,13792707,"Posted: 2 January, 2015",all,Allan Gordon,"If you like more puzzley STGs like Ikaruga then this is right in your alley. I've gotten to rank 32 in the leaderboards so I feel like I've gotten a good understanding of the mechanics.You have 3 types of shot. Normal, Laser, and I guess you could call it destroy. Normal rips up enemies but gives little score, laser shoots through enemies and builds score by giving a chain kill bonus, and destroy shoots through enemy blue/purp attacks and also leaves anything it hits near death. Normal shot is the only one that can hit enemies in the background which shares a different chain bonus from laser. You have limited laser shot that regens. Destroy uses meter that is shared with the overdrive power which when activated rapidly regens your laser as well as buffing your shot damage.You can also rotate the map left and right to line up enemies for destroy/laser combos or to avoid shots that would normally hit. It is also crucial to rotate to be able to attack background objects that will give score.There are background chests that hold powerups. You don't build up your shot like most STGs from powerups in this one. Instead they hold health, laser reload, or overdrive reload. They spawn the same powerup in the same location everytime so for score its important to know when you should be using your laser/destroy/overload abilities so that you don't waste any powerups.It's quite a bit of fun once you get into the mechanics. There is also a challenge mode which helps you understand how to build score and utilitze the mechanics the best. Only minor problem I have is that this game is fairly short and the final boss at least in my opinion was somewhat lackluster. But this is an indie STG which has really amazing mechanics so I can't get too hard on it.The brightness (and afaik the lack of ability to turn it down) is another minor problem but you get used to it.tl;dr if you like ikaruga and can deal with the fact that this is an indie game and thus doesn't have as much production values or as tuned boss fights as some other STGs then you'll be in for a treat."

The ability to turn the camera around 360 degrees seemed at bit gimmicky at first, once I got used to it I started to like it though.The main problem of this game is the difficulty level: it’s just way too easy. I managed to beat it after just two hours. You can get hit countless times and still make it through the levels. This means you don’t really need to use the camera system that much, since even if you do get hit by offscreen enemies, it doesn’t really matter.Still, there aren’t many recent 2D shooters with such a nice presentation and the game is definitely fun to play, so I can easily recommend this to any fans of the genre."

It's like Gradius, except you can tilt the angle of your vertical view, so an attack that would take up the whole screen can now be easily dodged by flipping it onto its side. It's a unique and polished ride. Be warned though, the game is not for the lighthearted. You get a good amount of health in the beginning to fend off damage, and you can repair your ship with pickups found through the game, but you only get one life, and if you die, it's game over. Bottom line, I have yet to beat the game, but I'm very close, and I still recommend this pretty little gem in my steam library."

This game has some serious good music (i am not even into this genre but still dig it!) and has no OST as DLC... that is rare. Production values are very good. The rotating camera is really well done but it does have one flaw that even though the bullets fly in a 3D environment where you can line up the shots the hitboxes are still in 2D so even if the part of the line of bullets would be in the background they will still hit u when u fly over them which is ok but for the line lasers it does get a bit problematic at times to dodge them. Still very recommended for bullet hell shmuppers alike. I hope this developer will make more shmups in the future, would be like a Chinese Siter Skain! :D"

The revolver mechanic really makes the background a massive factor in the game. However, all of the enemies bullets are two dimensional. It's really hard to explain but think of it this way, you see off in the distance an enemy that is shooting a laser out, it looks like it's there to block your path but even though its far off in the background, if you move your ship in front of the laser, you will get hit by it. It can be really disorienting at times.Second, the ship is boring, you have 3 weapons, your standard shot that shoots directly infront of you, a laser that shoots right in front of you, and an EMP that shoots right in front of you(or clears all bullets on screen if you let it charge) Lasers turn yellow bullets into points, EMP turns anything into Points. But since you can't shoot anywhere but in front of you, you can't hit anything above or behind you. This wouldn't such a problem as long as things didn't attack from behind or above, but they do, a lot. It's just angering since there is almost nothing you can do about those enemies. What would be so wrong with having multiple weapons that shoot somewhere besides infront of you? Oh yes and inorder to hit background enemies you have to get close to them in order to shoot them, so if that thing shoots you from way back in the background it will hit you instantly and you'll be ""too close"" to dodge.Third, the arching paths is really a non factor, there is almost no difference between the different paths, I'm not sure why they included it. Do you want the tunnel full of enemies, or the other tunnel full of enemies, it makes almost no difference.The Graphics are very good for an indie title and the music is great, and the game comes with the sound track. It's well polished and has no bugs as far as I can see, it's not great but it's not bad either and the price they are asking is completely reasonable. An okay game with one cool mechanic, but not much else."

I played for 4/5 hours and I have already got half and more of the achievements, completed the story mode and won half the challenges (which can be really challenging, however).The final level and boss are almost a joke, since the level has half the lenght of the first one, and the boss is really easy to beat, even if it's not being compared to other bosses as the second level one, which I find to be the more entertaining and difficult.Graphics are really nice, and go along with the game.I loved the game, but I feel like I need more to play with. More levels, sometimes more bullets, and a thougher final boss would make this a 9 or 10.Also, I buyed it on discount, but the full price seems a little too much for the product given.[EDIT for the steam awards: I think It should win something because its graphical awesomeness and its entertainment value!]"
