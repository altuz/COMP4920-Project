76561198049500020,Recommended,313480,19593126,"Posted: 9 December, 2015",all,76561198049500020,"I wanted to comment to anybody not liking this game due to it being ""unfair"" or because the pathing sucks, or because of this, or because of that. That fact of the matter is that you're dealing with total, brutal, and almost perfect simulation of a battle. It has its quirks, and its weak points, but not buying this game is really forcing you to miss out on one of the best WW2 strategy games ever created. Below is a rant and roast of persons saying this game sucks:Firt, You realize how deadly a fight really is, right? I mean, 80 percent of your casualties are going to be from indirect fire, shrapnel, and explosives anyway. That's a HISTORICAL STATISTIC you can look up. As far as pathfinding, I agree. It is pretty irritating, but that's why you should be using the shift key to manage the path your units take.Even so, I don't find your review fair, in and of itself. Despite what games like Company of Heroes will display, a tank is not going to bulldoze a damn tree, so not being able to drive through a forest is realistic, open ground means death, cover is an absolute requirement for survival, and stationary tanks and guns are incredibly accurate. A tank or AT gun is essentially a giant rifle, as the grooves in the barrel are pretty much the same as the grooves in a rifle barrel. I found the deadly aspect of weapons refreshing. If you get shot, you're going to die. That's just the way it is. If a round busts through a weak point in a vehicle's armor, its going to be destroyed. Again, that's just the way it is. On some tanks, particularly the German Panther, the armor in the rear is only a few millimeters thick. If that thing gets hit in the rear, either the engine is doomed, and the vehicle is pretty much screwed, or that round is going to travel the length of the tank until it stops. There have been accounts where a bad enough hit on a tank carries enough force to blow the turret off the top of the tank. The HEAT rounds from a Bazooka, PIAT, or Panzerfaust are shape charges, meaning it is designed to literally burn through the armor of a tank and get inside, killing every man in there.Furthermore, the allied tanks during the war toted weaker armor, less effective weaponry (until high caliber AT guns were placed into them, boasting faster velocities and better ballistic characteristics). Even more, the Germans had the BEST ENGINEERS IN THE WORLD at the time. Most of their military equipment was better in almost every way. The allies won due to sheer numbers and better tactics/strategy. The game boasts encyclopedia knowledge to orient you to the time period and situation, fulfilling a stronger level of immersion. The game's historical accuracy is almost uncontested in comparison to its sequels, and similar games of the time period.I want to reiterate that you need to realize just how DEADLY combat is. If you make a bad tactical decision, you are going to get your a** kicked. A good tactician takes their disadvantages and turns them into advantages, anyway. Or, he/she mitigates their disadvantages as much as possible to make victory possible.Although, I do, again, have to agree with you about the pathing. It's really heinous, which is why I downloaded a new ailogic.dll I found online, derived from games based on the Blitzkrieg engine, that fixes the problems the AI is having, and many more mods exist in Blitzkrieg communities to make the game better still.Your review lacks a realistic point of view, thus I must disagree almost entirely with it. You're dealing with an entirely new breed of strategy game with this one. That's why it's so popular with strategists and WW2 grognards alike. Buy this game. NO, SERIOUSLY, BUY IT..."

A few things to know about this game:THERE ARE NO BASES - There is something awfully appealing about having a certain ammount of units and being told to capture an area without reinforcements.The Campaign is fairly repetitive after a while. Essentially you will end up doing similar convoy missions, town clearing missions, defend the gun emplacement missions etc to get upgraded tanks and artillery.Without fail i have hit a point in every campaign where i need a break - Everytime i have played though it (more than two dozen times for each side) I will find that the missions get too repetitive and i need to play something else. I find that this game draws me back like a wasp to jam, and i need to take my units though the campaign so they can go home.This game is a relic, it is from 2003, so don't expect fancy graphics, or elaborate game plots. This is exactly what it says on the tin, and without fail i would say that it is the best strategy game I have played. True, it has it's bad points, but every game does, but the magic i got when i first played this game is still there, and it's still worth playing!I notice that i doesnt have much play time on record, truthfully i have sunk well over 1500 hours into this game, but having just bought it on Steam, i have yet to match this."

76561198028170373,Recommended,313480,31910492,Posted: 22 May,all,Benzin,"Bottomline:Probably the best real time tactics ww2 game ibe ever played, certainly the best in the blitzkrieg series imo.There is no base building, resource gathering, increasing production, or managing whole wars & armies here. Just good old military tactics.I played this game for 100s of hours years ago, and even though i have my original disk (somewhere) i bought it again on steam.Graphics are a little dated of course, but still looks good enough. The best part of this game is its gameplay, not its looks so if what you are looking for is flashy shinny explosions, there are better options out there. But if youre after a challenging, realistic and extremely fun gameplay, with complete historical accuracy, this is certainly what you are looking for.This is one of very few games, where TACTICS are really crucial for success. Sure most RTS games say that, but in the end you can just throw a blob of units and win. Not here.This game is one of very few, in wich just throwing a large blob of units at your enemy is a guarantee of defeat. Here you need to do recon, most likey a long range artillery strike before the assault, be carefull of artillery counter attacks, use your air support, complement your tanks with infantry support, etc.Failure to use TACTICS in this game, in any difficulty above easy will result in the speedy death of your forces.About the only negative point i can pin on it, is its pathfinding for units is sometimes crappy. Units DO get where you tell them to, but sometimes they hessitate looking left and right before going on their way.If you do get this game, i suggest downloading the EXBK mod. It extends the size of the maps, adds extra challenge, improves units, in general it makes the game even better:DISCLOSURE: i am the author of the EXBK mod. haha"

I've remembered when it lagged frequently on my old compaq Pentium 4 computer lolThis game is so good that I still have my first physical copy installed since 2008 (wanted to play it during that time and it was only about ~800-900 mb so it doesn't tax on your hard drive at all). So since 2008, After playing all the mission that was offered in this game + expansion, I wanted to see if there were any modifications to this game to further enhance my imagination. My god, there was; mods like CSLA and ROK 1950 mod was the best that I've seen for this game and probably was the reason why I never deleted it. If you ever wanted to play this game but in a different time period (i.e. Korean War/Cold War) you should definitely try out the CSLA and ROK 1950s mod (the 'official' blitzkrieg mod forum was shut down [Bk portal] in 2009 but that place had everything, every custom map every mods were there and now its gone....) I'll post link to the mod in the comment (glad to see that the other old sites are still working). With this mod, I had so much fun in playing that I started making tweaks of my own to these mods especially combining these two mods together.However, the issues that exist with these mods are that there is not many of the single player custom missions that comes with it (it takes alot of time scripting each units and making waypoints, such). So you are left with downloading other custom maps and making the missions on your own but again too much time. But these few missions have some memorable missions like the Fuldagap in the CSLA mod where you are holding off the Russian invasion into Western Germany with German and US forces (Of course TONS of new units, new Aircraft animations, helicopters as well).Bottomline: Game is worth every cent, still play it (with mods too), my first WWII strategy game"

There a few little annoying things to make you crazy such a vehicles that run around in mad circles and get lost. The tanks need a reverse button so you can back out of a firefight instead of being shot in the butt. It is very frustrating to ask a vehicle to back away and then have it sit grinding its gears until its armor is all blown away.There is heaps of action and some scenarios that are as good as anything in the genre.

76561198263380562,Recommended,313480,30542892,Posted: 16 March,all,Fluffiest Tank,"Going through each of the games in the anthology, I will say that Blitzkrieg itself is not like most RTS games in the sense that it really puts emphasis on tactics rather than force. While you will undoubtedly get a lot of more powerful core units as you progress in the game (at least for the Germans and Russians), you have to really be careful of what you do or else you'll really lose a lot of good core units in the process. The main game is good overall, though the encyclopedia was lacking in descriptions for some of the units, compared to its successors. The Allies in my opinion had the hardest campaign out of the bunch merely because of the fact they don't have units that are as powerful as the Russian or German units, and while you do get a number of them in the historical battles, almost are ineffective in anything else besides contemporary armor. Tank Destroyers like the M36 and the M26 heavy tanks are about the only real threats to the German Tigers and such. Meanwhile, the latter two campaigns (Germans and Russians) are a bit easier to play, simply because you get access to heavier weaponry like Tigers or ISU-152s (the latter of which I kept throughout the entirety of campaign after obtaining them). After I had finished the main campaigns, I then went on to Burning Horizon, and finally Rolling Thunder. I am going to be honest and say that I found Burning Horizon to be significantly easier than Rolling Thunder because the latter's finale has you go through an almost impossible-to-complete situation whereas the former's finale essentially has to do with storming the fortress motive. Either way, I still enjoyed these two parts of the Anthology as well, and was also quite pleased by the introduction of a lot of new units. However, I also felt that the descriptions for these new units could have also been spruced up at the time of their release, but otherwise I have no other quarrels about it. I find it a good game in almost every aspect and highly reccomend it to those who want a real challenge."

The pathfinding can be pretty bad at times with units most commonly taking the shortest possible route which has obvious consequences. On ""attack"" missions the enemy AI usually just waits around for you to attack.There are two types of missions, the randomly generated and the historical. The random ones are all right.

I played a demo back in 2003 and I love the game ever since so I was happy I could replace my scratched up disks with a digital copy. The game itself lets you control infantry, vehicles, tanks and even planes (to a certain limit). And it is LOADS of fun. You can go bulldozer through enemy ranks (if you are lucky) or can instead send a sniper to scout and then blast your enemy with your artillery. The historical missions are great and will make you think. Downside is that the side missions scenario repeats so it gets repetitive. Also the movement/placement/pathing is a bit obstructed by the 2D graphics and gets annoying sometimes. This also makes the AI glitch up occasionally.

The tight pixel artstyle blended it with 3D tanks has allowed the game to age well.As for gameplay, that warrants a mention in of itself. Unlike most RTS games, Blitzkrieg is a patient man's game, and requires careful planning and precision to be played well. It's a game that forces you to care about your units like company of heroes, but unlike company of heroes, you are forced to look at a larger picture.

I have played many rts games (Supreme Commander, Company of Heroes, World in Conflict, Sins of the Solar Empire, ect) and I really enjoyed this one due to how resourceful and careful you have to be. Every unit given to you has a purpose and once lost (with the exception of infantry unless you loose your supply truck or your transport plane is shot down) cannot be replaced.  All in all in my opinion its a great game and well worth $5.00."

Giving you the options to play as the...BritishGermansAmericansRussiansDuring each mission, you are giving as many troops as your high commanders see fit to the mission you lead. One thing I believe makes the game the most unforgiving is it's heavy, but realistic focus on artillery and vehicles. You can basically win every mission with artillery and tanks. Only issue infront of you is other tanks and infantry, but that's besides the point.This beautiful gem of a classic RTS can only be played by those that wish to be beaten to submission, then turned into hardened RTS players. Think of it this way, Blitzkrieg Anthology is like bootcamp, it'll force you to your knees and break you into submission, only giving you the choice to pursue, or to cower. If you chose to cower, you refund the game with anger in your eyes wondering why you wasted time and money on the game. If you chose to pursue, it will be a hard journey, a path that only the brave and bold are willing to take. Will you take the path of pursuing? Or will you cower like a whipped dog. The choice is yours.I warn you, it is a tough game, it will make you scream and cry, but do not give up, because that is only step one to your victory. From there, it only gets worse, you will lose masses of units. From infantry collapsing to the ground by a round to the chest or worse, a tank bursting in flames by defeat, artillery supressed into the deepest crater to Hell, planes crashing from the sky, convoys ambushed to death by lines of bullets swiping through the tarps that held young soldiers, and more.Will you take the stand and lead your faction to victory? Or will you fall like the weak."

You will feel the importance of keeping a wellsupplied artillery line and how devastating they are towards infantry. It is hard to find things that is bad in this game, you can see the importance of keeping a strong supplyline, using the advantages of placing out mines, anti tank obstacles or making trenchen. Even swapping from explosives to smokegrenades on your artillery will prove to give you an tactical advantage over your enemy in some cases.What Nival has done is adding elements of realism into a simple game, by showing how dangerous a simple hidden gunspot can be, or how important it is to avoid destroying trees just to keep a stealthy approach with your small amount of armor units. Perhaps the only things that can draw this game down is it's stability on modern computers, while i do not experience many crashes i will have some occasionaly along with framerate drops if i increase the game speed too much. Otherwise the game might be quite tough for new players as the learning curve is quite high, but once you experience the game properly you will begin to see how dangerous certain combinations is and how important it is too use certain tactics against certain positions.One of my favorites of RTS games, 8/10"

This isnt a strategy game, its a puzzle game. Every mission seems to have an incredibly specific path to complete it and losing a single key unit can mean you have to restart. There is absolutely ZERO room for ingenuity and flexibility in the way you tackle the missions. It became so grating playing a mission over and over again so you can know where the hidden artillery pieces and anti tank guns are. This game doesn't reward good strategy, it rewards meta gaming.However, while I know this game certainly isnt for me, I know there will be a type of person that loves it. The repitition and difficulty will no doubt appeal to some and could possibly end up being very rewarding, like a RTS version of darksouls. For me however, its definetly a no."

The downside to the game is that the missions do get repetitive. Take the town, capture the warehouse, secure the bridge and so on. However, the realistic gameplay always pulls me back to play another mission because it's so much fun to level an entire town with heavy artillery or when I pull off a masterful attack that annihilates the enemy.Bottom Line:Old graphics with fun, engaging, and realistic gameplay but repetitive missions.If you like old strategy games and realistic gameplay, Blitzkrieg is a must-buy."

Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.

You can upgrade units to newer and more efficient models but these have to be earned, promotions give you more units to your disposal. Units also have ammo which needs to be replenished etc.  However the game is brutal and hard, you will pay for your mistakes or fielding wrong type of units, small mistakes may cost you the entire battle."

An rts where you have a core army of eventually 6 tanks and 6 artillery/anti-air guns and a fixed amount of support units. My game time is high, cause my main way of attacking the enemy was with 1 sniper and 3 tanks (because of path finding issues). Maybe artillery for support or maybe I just like the aesthetics of seeing artillery craters. Anyways, the sniper in this game is really OP. If the computer had their own sniper deployed on most maps, I would have had to use a different tactic. The sniper is basically invisible and has a high spotting range. Therefore, I could use my artillery or my tanks to attack from a safe distance, since the AI doesn't move when being attacked by an unseen force. And since these maps seem rather large, it took me awhile to clear the objectives with this tactic. On maps were you get a useless officer instead of a sniper, meant I either had to use my infantry as a sacrificial shield or play the load and save game. I would have gladly traded away all my useless support army for just for 1 sniper.You have to be careful of the enemy artillery, cause they seem to know the exact location of where your artillery is firing from. If you don't shoot and scoot your artillery, they definitely will kill that unit and to a lesser extent your frontline units.  It is really great to achieve air superiority, but it was hard to achieve. I usually can easily get their bombers with my fighters, but since you can't have fighters escort your bombers, you fall prey to their fighters or your bombers stupidly flying over to the enemy's side to get shot down by their AA.There are 3 campaigns, Allies, Germans, and Soviets. I did find the first 2 or 3 Allied missions underwhelming. I think I did stop playing for a while because of this. The missions have a sameness too them, especially the random ones, but I never got bored once I understood the game. Those historical missions where you are defending are almost epic. I'm not sure how many missions are in each campaign, cause I didn't notice there were historical missions mixed with random missions. Also you can do more random missions to get ""elite type"" units. Though I didn't notice this aspect until late into the last campaign. Though those random missions for those 6 IS-3 was definitely worth it.I like how they have stats for the tanks and other units and a brief historical description. This is nitpicky, but they really should have given some stats on how many enemies your core army killed and make you rank up higher. My core probably killed 100s of tanks and thousands of men and yet they were still lieutenants. I got this on sale for $0.99 so definitely worth it.  7/10"

I was happy to find them on Steam.In my opinion this is one of the best RTS games ever made. I only hope someday we get to buy the rest of Blitzkrieg based games from Steam too."

But you'll need some patience, because it's not very well polished. The pathing of the units and responsivnesss of the controls will test your patience. I often found I have to click on units or buildings multiple times before it registers. If you can get used to that, then it's worth it."

You can slow or speed up the game and You can give orders during active pause. This game is old, but You can still play with a pleasure. There are some issues with modern screen resolutions, but it is still playable.I bought box version many years ago and I finished base game and both expansions. I had only problems with Rolling Thunder that not all my core units were moving between missions (there was same units avaliable so that was not a case that I should not have them in the mission).I played only Iron Division expansion on Steam. You can access it from Rolling Thunder expansion when You choose custom game. I played all 5 missions from Germany side, but I was unable to play whole USSR side. I was able to finish only first mission and then it was end (suppose to be 4 missions in a row).About all units in game You can read some historical facts in encyclopedia inside game."

So this is my first time playing this and so far so good. I'm liking the gameplay. Denfinitely going to play more and finish the game and all of the additional content. I'm glad this went on sale for under $4 and enabled me to find it because of it!Downfall so far (unless I just haven't found it yet), not being able to play skirmish games against the CPU. A feature I love the most with RTS games."
