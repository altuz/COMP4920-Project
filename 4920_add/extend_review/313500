I played this many years ago along with the first one, Now the first game has terrible graphics but is still playable. Blitzkrieg 2 is a lot better but you still have to manouvre around the age barrier of the game. Realistic to an extent as bombers actually destroy tanks and not just knock a little bit off the huge red health bar games tend to have these days. You can build trenches, road blocks and other types of obstacles which make the  whole concept a lot more appealing. I have the first on disc (still) and just downloading this second anthology now, deffinitely worth the time and specially worth the low cost of money for the amount of gameplay you will get out of this!8/10(If you played the older generation of Command and Conquer, then you will absolutely love this!)"

Have been playing it for years and still holds its replay value with great multiplayer and campaigns. I recommend this game to any WW2 lovers or just strait up strategy gamers.Why get this game?:- posseses almost every vehicle and artillery system used in World war 2, ranging from the French Renault R35 to the Russian IS-3 main battle tank- Great multiplayer with a small but growing community of players- Requires tactics over massed tank rushes(unless you want to be slaughtered by your friends entrenched infantry and anti-tank guns!)- Deployable air support such as B-29's, Me-262's, and the famous P-51 Mustang- An amazing single player campaign throughout the game and its added expansions featuring US/UK, German, and Soviet campaigns with the Russian one featuring one of the most epic last stands in history known as the Battle of Berlin"

Whether you get this or the first game, it'll be well worth the the $5 fee. It has a great campaign with famous battles from World War II, with the ability to play as America, Russia, or Germany. Beyond that it has a great custom map editor that allows you to create entire campaigns. The possibilities are endless with the map editor and a healthy amount of mods for anyone who wants anything extra. To add to this deal, the game includes both expansion packs for free."

Campaign was really good in my opinion, but multiplayer is where it really shines.Sadly, there is a problem with the screen tearing and I do not know how to fix it. It really bugs me and I wish I could find a solution. Hopefully they add an update and fix it. It seems to happen with people who use 1920 x 1080 resloutions.Another downfall to this is that multiplayer is disabled, which is a really huge shame. I hope this gets enough support and they will add steam servers to Blitzkrieg IIOverall, if you likeanyRTS, (especially company of heroes) then i definatly recommended this game."

I remember playing this game for hours on end, even had a 6 hour multiplayer game once (not proud, but sorta proud). The campaign is amazing, very indepth and offers tremendous amounts of player skill to vary the outcomes of any scenario. You can play a total of three campaigns, one for USA, Germany, and Soviet Russia. Although these campaigns are great, and could easily suck up a few days of your time, the real fun is in the multiplayer area. The game is a totally different animal and is immensely fun as a multiplayer, unfortunately the multiplayer function is disabled :'( I'm sure this is one game that steam would not regret opening some multiplayer servers for. Back in the day, this game always had around 50 people playing it at any time, which is much higher than most RTS games can say for their landing lobby. If you're into WW2 tactics and creating your own strategies in real-time combat, this is the game for you."

,Recommended,313500,25462421,"Posted: 11 September, 2016",all,Burn,"I haven't played Blitzkrieg 2 when it first came out, because I thought that the 3D graphic was cartoonish looking and it had a gameplay mechanic that I absolutely hated in RTS. In one infantry unit you can visually see 10 soldiers. The less HP this unit has, the less soldiers there will be. One soldier is not an individual unit, but just a 10 percent of a whole unit's health. I love it when RTS games give every unit some individuality, like the kill count in Starcraft or a personal name like in Original War. And I just hate when RTS games, like Blitzkrieg 2, go in the opposite direction in that regard.But playing this now, I can look past that. Even playing this today this game is fun, though it feels a bit arcade-y, less difficult and certainly more friendlier to WW2 RTS newcomers.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=761274778http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=761918483"

I go with a single player review as I have had limited success on playing multiplayer (connection issues before it got on steam).The game itself is the traditional RTS with three sides to play as (U.S, Germany and U.S.S.R), facing battles as far as the pacific to the inner steppes of the Soviet Union.Strategy in this game is key as you immediately see in the campaign map, after you finish the mission you start with (TIP: Retreat from that mission to gain a commander to one of your army branches to gain experience) you will see a counter.This ""reserves"" counter tells you the available ammount of units you can call in on a mission on that total front.Making you decide where to put the most reserves in, put most on the smaller side missions or save up for the grand mission that is the largest and most important to progress. Taking in my regard strategy to a ""front scale"".Maps are of varied size and scale,  and it's understandable when you might get a mission with only infantry and on others you have tanks and artillery at your disposal and it gives a variation in challenge, albeit at times a bit too much of a challenge.Gameplay can be as fun as it is frustrating, gather intel through recon or saturate an area with bombs/artillery by chance, it is up to you how to advance but it can be costly and each loss is counted up for your commander of that branch it belonged to, a bit of a extra challenge for those who want to go through the war with minimal losses like me.Graphics may be at the brink of being dated but in my eyes it still looks good, damage models and vehicle wrecks mixed in among the craters of different size (depending on the caliber/type of bomb detonated) can make the game look like a scene for a movie.The age is more or less the only thing I have against the game, I will not talk about multiplayer as I have not tried BK's steam version.As a history nerd I like the cutscenes with old film footage and the historical narration, I don't know how many times I started my own research during progressing in this game.To those who have finished the game and those who like to make maps there is a map editor, alter missions to your advantage or make them more difficult.Sadly the lack of a workshop (to my knowledge) makes additional player made maps lacking.In all, it is a game worth buying. It carries on the tradition of Blitzkrieg and still keeps it well and alive to this day.If you are new to this game or like me, nostalgic you won't regret having this in your library."

Instead, you end up leveling up ""classes of units"", which gets you slight to very good improvements.  Some of the missions deploy you in a bad spot, so it makes it hard to achieve no losses for a particular class.  I miss have the sniper as my spotter. I basically used my disposaple infantry as spotter and cannon fodder. The AI still attacks the nearest units, so my entrenched infantry were being attacked instead of my anti-tank guns or tanks.  The AI still doesn't move when being attacked by an unseen force. You are restricted as to what units you can deploy as reinforcements, but you are given a good amount if you just want to zerg across the map.  My prefered method of attack would be ground air planes as spotter. mobile artillery so I can move it out of the way of enemy counter artillery, and heavy armor for their sligthly better defense. However, I usually had to use infantry as spotter and medium armor to attack.There are 3 campaigns, Allies, Germans, and Soviets. At least 15 missions in each campaign. There are more variety of missions  compared to the first one. Some of those missions are rather fun.  Only the soviet campaign has some almost epic defensive battles.I like how they have stats for your kill to death ratio.  I got this on sale for $0.99 so definitely worth it.  7.25/10"

The scenarios are more varied and dynamic than those of the original game, which makes for more compelling gameplay. I've beaten two of the three campaigns the base game comes with, which took me about 30 hours on Hard difficulty.The game is at it's best when you control a slightly under-equipped battle group and need to use reconnaissance and cunning tactics to decide how best to dismantle enemy resistance.My biggest criticism is that as the campaigns ramp up, the scenarios pit battlegroups of increasing size and firepower against each other, to the point where the only viable scenario is to incrementally carpet bomb everything in your way to avoid taking unmanageable losses.Still a great game overall."

The second i started the tutorials i realised that brute force and overwhelming numbers don't work. You have to use strategy, such as an artillery bombardment before your charge, or hitting the enemy in the rear and making there defences useless. The reinforcements system forces you to think about what the attack will cost you, it affects you in the long run. They feature that cought me off gaurd is the ammo system, your tanks and soldiers RUN OUT of ammo, when this happens you need to have a supply truck resuply them, and they have a limited supply, making ware houses (infinit supplies) something to defend as well as your supply routs to the front lines. Further more unlike some games that just copy paste units, every side (even the NPCS) have thier own unique rooster of units giving them an advantage in thier field. Germans: Tanks Soviets: Rocket artillery Americans: Jack of all trades. The graphics arn't master pieces but they are pretty good for 2005. As the campaigns go on, you steadily start being assigned larger and more important missions, which makes it feel as if you are rising through the ranks from some leutenant commanding a few squads of infantry and a hand full of tanks to a general commanding an army to glory. Over all it is a very realistic RTS, gameplay wise, and it will apeal to those who like a realistic RTS.PROS:unique units all aroundrealistic combatsupply linesentrenchment abilities (mines, trenches, obstacles.)bridges can be destroyed and take engineering crews to rebuildunits run out of ammolimited number of reinforcmentswell balanced (MOAR TANKS! strategy doesn't work)Use your own strategyAI actually does stuff (most of the time[sometimes forgets it can reload artillery])Strategy required (can't just charge and hope for things to turn out OK)CONS:graphicsSoviet Rocket truck spam(3 SRTs> 50 German medium tanks gaurding a town)Have to micromanage my army.

But I think BK 2 is much better than former one.Of course BK 1 is also astonishingly awesome but BK 2 has several attractive features -1. You can form your own army & advanced tactics in single play missions with finite reinforcements.In BK 1, you could't organize your own as each mission provides certain troops and you can receive certain reinforcements under certain conditions. But in BK2, there aren't much troops in the very beginning of the missions. So you must call reinforcements that you want to prepare for defensive or offensive actions. And I am lovin' it. If you are good at infantry tactics, you can form your army mostly with infantries. If you good at armoured tactics, you can form your army mostly with armours.2. You can train your troops by experiencing themin BK 1 you can only train certain artilleries and armours but in BK 2, you can train Infantries, armours, artilleries, and even airforces in Group!

For example, if you have 10 tanks and want get to one point. if you are lucky 5 of them get there on the same time and the rest 20-60 secs later. if you are unlucky some of them goes in to enemy territory and get blown up.- Some of your units goes kamikaze without reason. AA trucks starts chasing planes all over the map, tanks starts chasing units, infantry with camouflage on tries to kill enemy units far far away and gets killed on the way there. The list goes on. One funny thing, I did not have this problem in the German campaign. Just the allied campaign.- Not so very good music. Sure its from 2005, but it is still below average.- Enemy AI can see you before you see them. Sadly this is quite common in most games, Enemy AI don't have ""fog of War"" enabled.Quote ( A staple in both the real-time and turn-based strategy genres, Fog of War simulates the unknowns of the battlefield by covering areas of the map, to be progressively revealed by the player )End Of Quote"

It is still a good game, as I said before, but it's just that there are better games out there that you can go for, especially in terms of pacing. The game's pacing is a bit too fast for my taste, as one can end up beating this game in probably two days at most if you plan on playing nonstop. That said, I wouldn't suggest getting the game right away, but maybe if you have nothing else to really do and can't decide what strategy game you want to test your skills at next."

This sequel looks the original one, but without the ability to mount, equip and keep your own forces like in the previous game, in this version you can only use the vehicles they give you. You also can't repeat battles to get additional upgrades to your forces.The maps are terrible and most of time you just can´t maneuver because there are single roads running directly to enemy fire. I played the first 3 battles and the only artillery I got was two mortars I captured from enemy. Air support was useless as they did not attacked the chosen coordinates but far away targetsHowever, the reason I uninstalled this game is the annoying AI. All the time your troops move without orders, tanks turn their backs to the enemy when ordered to retreat and many other AI issues. I cant stand so many silly behavior. So I can only advise you to do not buy this game."

HOW IS A TRUCK ABLE TO BLOW UP IN 2 SECONDS AFTER BEING FIRED BY A 5 MEN SQUAD WITH BLOODY MP40s?!!!!Only on your side there is a strategy, but by the part of the AI, there is no strategy or whatsoever... The AI looks pretty much like a 12 year old kid that just select all the units on the screen and order a full out assault.Plus, you can't do anything to stop it, since your MG nests, even though they are entrenched, are going to be cleared within a *blink* of yours... and AT guns? well, they do have some AP power, but absolutelly no defence... A german rifleman can just aim at it and with his magical 900/rounds per minute Ka98, is going to rekt him, only if the AT gun is paying attention somewhere, because if not, its probable that the poor rifleman is going to face his worst nightmare... A Machinegun enplacement with the ability to fire AP shells.+Plus, the infantary requires some hacking-like skills to be fully used, I have lost the count of how many times I have seen entire companies being whiped out in questions of seconds by OPS AT guns and mortars...

It is more dumb than... well... the level is so low that I can't even explain it. I GOES OUT OF THE RANKING.I can't think of why the developers would made a tank AI so dumb that it just TURNS ITS BACK ARMOR to the enemy when ordered to go back... Also, it doesn't really looks like the AI has more functions than:1. Avoiding hitting hard objects (houses per example)2. Shooting with a shameful precision sometimes and a sniper some other times.3. Fire and reload faster than Flash on cocaine (giving a new meaning to ""BlitzKrieg"")...If you are looking for realistic gameplay, this is a REALLY fast paced game, so you do better get away from this page right now and never come back.In the other hand, if you are looking for CHALLENGING gameplay, this is the game for you!the game where a Panzer III would get rekt by a british AA gun, and where Light AT guns shot like machineguns...P.S: After writting this review I guess I just discovered the meaning behind the name ""Blitzkrieg""."

It offers a lot of missions through 3 different campains and each mission is truly unique in it`s own way. They could range from full scale assault operation to bloody deffensive missions and also to specialised missions. There are 3 campains you could choose: either you can play as the allies starting in the pacific campains and ending your war on the western front, you can play for Germany starting with the fall of france and then standing your ground in the west as the reich falls and finally you can play on the bloodiest fields of the eastern front as the soviets and then drive your attack all the way to Berlin. You will always be stuck with the dilema of what type of reinforcements you should call in and moreover, as a strategist, you have to know when to deploy them. Be aware however that you are also limited to a certain amount of reinforcements that you can call on the battlefield in every mission which adds the fact that you should carefully plan your attacks and that every move you make may end up granting you victory or leading to your inevitable end. Also, unlike the first blitzkrieg, this one has a more enhanced army upgrading system. Each mission, once accomplished, rewards you with much better equipment and therefore makes your army much more efficient and advanced. In addition you can assigne officers to your different  army branches which with experience receive combat bonuses. This allows to therefore customise your army. In general, this is a very nice RTS game. A very worthy sequel following the first game. If enoy RTS games in general then I`d say it`s defenitely a must have."
