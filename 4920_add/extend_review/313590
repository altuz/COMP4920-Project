,Recommended,313590,11983767,"Posted: 4 September, 2014",all,shoggofu,"I have played Boo Bunny plague for 2 hours. I thought it was alright, good for it’s price.- Some of the dialogue is amusing and the music is cool- Generally the actual combat isn’t very interesting and mainly consists of swinging an assortment of guitars at run of the mill enemies, but some of the later bosses were interestinghttp://youtu.be/HrO-LCD3rDESo your abilities in combat are limited to swing your equipped guitar and a manually activated protective shield that has a limited charge. There are no special moves aside from a third consecutive guitar swing which will do extra damage and have an area of effect. The charge of your shield will regenerate but health and shields can be replenished by picking up shield or carrot powerups which will respawn.-----You can hit snowballs back towards ice men by swinging your guitar at them. But this wasn’t really very effective or particularly fun. So I usually just swung my guitar at most enemies without bothering to activate my shield because you can’t move or attack while shielded. When you are low on health you can just kite enemies around while you look for health pick-ups.-----Other than that you can run. But there’s no dashing, sprinting or rolling. But I think that kind of feature would have been nice. One of the bosses will moves exactly as fast as you run and once you are in his range it is can be very difficult to avoid his attacks. That is until you learn to stand on top of vehicles which will explode causing him to be stunned. You can toggle run mode and move even slower by walking. But I’m not sure why you would want to do this.-----Sometimes your robot friend will accompany you in battle and if you hit him he will fire his guns killing all enemies instantly within a short radius. He will despawn and reappear after sometime before you can activate this ability again.-----At one instance I noticed that he had trouble finding a path out an area and got stuck. I had to go in and coax him out. I also noticed that you and some AI controlled characters will clip through some of the walls.-----While you don’t really have any special attack you can equip different guitars which have different effects and deal more or sometimes less damage. New guitars are hidden around the different environments. I found my first new guitar by belting up a hippy. It was an acoustic and made love hearts appear when used. I’m not sure what was special about it aside from the comedic value. Some of other guitars I found were imbued with fire and lighting and did extra damage over time.-----The first few bosses were pretty straightforward and not really challenging. Most of their attacks could easily be avoided just by side stepping or running away. There is almost always plenty of respawning health pickups you can use to replenish your life whenever it gets low.-----It didn’t really start to get interesting or hard until I encountered the bosses War and then Famine. You couldn’t just simply beat the latter into submission, there is actually a special way to defeat her. Finding out what that was puzzled me for a fair while. After her the next boss Death was also challenging.-----The games graphics definitely aren’t fantastic. But a fair bit of effort went towards populating the world with some colourful characters and some obvious parodies of the Thor featured in films over the last fer year and the band Slayer with a song and very a very Slayer like emblem.-----The game is really more about the music. After all it is a musical. The fact that characters in the game frequently burst into song during cutscenes or even during the action was kind of cool. Real music is a nice touch.-----In regard to dialogue and lyrics, not all of it was amazing. But some of it was amusing such as that of the Vikings who occasionally call out ‘Kill the rabbit’ like Elma Fudd.-----The enemies that I encountered so far other than bosses were all vikings. Unless you count the robot bunny ‘competition’ and assembly line machines you encounter at the very beginning. I thought there would be more variety to the hostile entities you come across.-----But their was a fair bit of variety to bosses you encountered. There was a giant toy robotic T-Rex, Thor God of Thunder posing as a ‘Village (person)’ construction worker and so on. The most interesting were the four horsemen of the apocalypse. Each was a variant of the Robot Bunny protagonist or one of his friends, the succubus, the elephant man and the military robot. A moment during the introductory cut-scene of the latter felt very reminiscent of Borderlands.I enjoyed playing this game. For it’s price the game is pretty good. I think it’s worth taking a look at."

BUT...I couldn't help being entertained by the story. The voice acting is great, the music is awesome, and there are tons of (American) pop culture references. Just as I started growing bored with the action, a cutscene would make me laugh out loud. Did I mention musical numbers and rap battles? And heavy metal? And hitting enemies with guitars that spew fire? Awesomesauce.For under $5, playing B.B.P. is far more entertaining than watching a re-run of your favorite sitcom."
,Recommended,313590,18705249,"Posted: 26 October, 2015",all,Sherlock Hound,"The gameplay is pretty lacking with only about three open world levels and the rest of the game just back-to-back boss fights. The boss fights get repetitive, with most being defeated by simple ""hit, hit, dodge, repeat"" tactics. When not fighting bosses, you're forced to fight through droves of the same two types of enemies (vikings and ice monsters) while exploring barren levels. There aren't really collectibles so there's no incentive to explore. The combat is clunky and I kept on experiencing a glitch that didn't allow me to adjust the camera while running.So why am I recommending it? The music and the main characters steal the show and are the main reason to play this game. For two dollars, it's a blast just listening to the crazy banter and music. While it started getting stale towards the end, it wasn't really a problem because of the game's short length. I found myself just looking forward to the next cut scene and not really caring about the actual gameplay."

Bunny moves very awkwardly at least by modern standards. I found the KB + M controls more comfortable than the X360 controls but I guess that comes to preference.

,Not Recommended,313590,11995248,"Posted: 5 September, 2014",all,VENumos,"I completed this game in 2 hours (That includes times I died) I don't recommend it as it is an extremely short and basic game. The only real good thing is the charm of the one character you play as ""Bunny"" who in my opinion acts kinda like deadpool. This makes the cutscenes and dialog the best parts of the game by far. The combat system consists of nothing but lmb to hit and rmb to block, there are some strategies required for the later bosses and some of them are quite interesting but apart from that just running around and hitting them should be fine. I suppose you kind of pay for what you get seems it's a very cheap game however there is better out there for the same price range. Considering the best part of the game is the dialog and cutscenes you may aswell just watch videos of said scenes seems the rest of the game isn't that great. Graphics could definetly be alot better with the unity engine and the story line is also very.. You guessed it! Basic. The music is alright and the game sometimes turns into a musical seems bunny loves to sing about dismembering his friends, Which is good for a few laughs.If you want a couple laughs and not much more then I recommend the game but if you want a game with good game mechanics, Graphics or story then you might want to pass on this one."

I had read that it was humorous, but do you really trust people when they say something is funny? People called American Pie funny after all. With prejudice about humanity's sense of humour I nearly skipped this game. But something about the ragtag cast of characters just wouldn't let me simply write it off.Good thing I didn't.While the visuals aren't aweinspiring, they work just fine for the game and, when looking closer at some of the characters, you can see that they are actually well made (just look at Ganesha, he is cool).What really makes the game shine is the writing. Especially the singing. When Bunny started to sing, all my reservations about the sillyness of this game washed away. The game is funny and it is made by one talented team.Mind you, I have had some minor performance issue, then again, my laptop has seen better days.Wholeheartedly recommended to anyone who'd enjoy a grotesque musical about hiting people over the head with a guitar (or three). And everyone should enjoy that."

And this is the reason why is stuck with the game the whole way through.- This game also has great voice acting and each character has their own unique personalities that i really like.- The game also has decent graphics. they aren't bad, but they arent great. Also the characters are nicely detailed.Cons:- This game has terrible gameplay. You can only do a 3 combo attack and an air attack. If Gunny is around, you can hit him with your guitar and he will explode to bullets. To bad he dissapears every 30 seconds.- The game has crappy animation. In the cutscenes, they act so fidgity and sometimes there movements dont corespond to what they are saying. Sometimes the models cease to exist.- This game is short. For a $3.50 game thats not a big deal, but campign is all you have. And the campaign is about 8 lvls (correct me if im wrong). There is no extra mode like survival or coop.- This game gets hard for no reason. The games first boss was an easy, but then the second boss get difficult and you may die once. But then he becoms easy. But the rest of the bosses have some sort of logic puzzle aspect and it either gets confusing or almost unbeatable (also the bifrost level sucked).The biggest problem im having with this is the dlc i payed an extra $1.30 for. I dont know how to access it or where i should look. If anyone can help me with this, please tell me how. Again, i really like the music in here and i really want to read the DC comic."

It's so rare for me to be perfectly ok with mediocre gameplay just to keep hearing more dialogue.Boo Bunny or just Bunny or...I'm honestly not sure, I don't recall a NAME being said...is born when a disgruntled employee in a robot bunny factory uploads a virus thing and you spring to life as a crazy person with a guitar, which you use to beat on things. There isn't really much in the way of a combo system, and you are fairly fragile, but you can block with a recharging shield that doesn't really work great either. You're saved from a robot t-rex by Gunny, a robot that may be just made entirely out of guns...and you're the best of friends from the start. There's a story from that point on, but it's sort of....confusing....but still funny. You fight Thor, founding member of the Village People. Some other things happen.

Because about 80% of the game's fun comes from the music. The humor is very adult-swim-ish, so if that's your bag? You'll like it.But you should know that the gameplay? Is just alternating between hitting things, and shielding yourself. And the enemies don't really put up that much of a challenge.Bosses are also pretty straightforward, save for a couple that I'd like to share some hints on.- During Famine's fight, pay close attention to what bunny is saying. She isn't like the others where you can just smack her around and be done. Use the handicap to your advantage. It took me a little while to figure it out, but the fight is really easy once you get it.- The hippie guitar you get in the beginning works REALLY WELL on one of the 4 horsemen.It's also a relatively short game, and one you're not likely to play a 2nd time. But it's funny, it's very playable, and I can imagine them doing a much more polished sequel if they get enough support. If you've got the spare cash, it's worth playing and supporting the devs."

,Recommended,313590,12672955,"Posted: 28 October, 2014",all,Hugkyu,"Let me tell you about this pretty game called Boo Bunny Plague.I picked it up using some of the rare Steam funds that I only seem to get once in a blue moon while it was on sale, and honestly I do not regret a penny. This game proudly holds the title of ""the first game that made me buy it instantly after watching the trailer.""So what is this game about?It's a game about a metal toy bunny who just wants to make the money required for an auto-repair, and along the way he goes across an intergalactic journey with his three pals trying to earn that money. I can only describe it as a linear action/adventure game, similar to games in the PS2 era. I loved my PS2, so to see a game that was so new yet classic-feeling at the same time was really something.But where this game truly shined was in its creativity. There's no exaggeration when I say that this game is really freaking funny. There are hilarious moments with every cutscene, and even during the gameplay itself, which are either original jokes or references. In the first half of the game, the subtitles definitely made me crack up a few times.On that note, the voice acting is brilliant. Each voice actor truly gave their characters life and personality, and a lovely singing voice I might add. Yes, there are numerous songs in this game, and for some reason, I love it. I've never seen another game do anything like it, and it worked beautifully. I am actually listening to the soundtrack while I am writing this, which I got with the game.Oh yeah. It's not just the singing I like, but the music too. It's so memorable I catch myself singing random songs throughout the day.How is the actual gameplay like? For me, it's smooth. I used the highest graphics settings and the game looked beautiful. This may be different for other computers though. The graphics themselves may not look as ""detailed"" as modern games, but personally I enjoyed the cartoony feeling this game gave me.The controls are simple to understand, and I used a gamepad for it. The levels themselves aren't too difficult, and there's an amount of different guitars to collect, some of which are optional and hard to find. Bosses occur very often in this game, and while some of them are easy to defeat, others are tricky and cause you to think before you just rush in and attack. There usually isn't a large penalty for dying, you'll just respawn instantly at the beginning of the room, or somewhere a few seconds from the point you died at.When completing the game and finishing the credits sequence, you unlock Impossible Mode, which, as you would guess, unlocks a much harder version of the original game. There's not much else going for it besides an achievement for beating it, but that was enough for me. By the way, I should mention that the game itself is rather short; it would take an average playthrough about two to three hours or so to beat it. But that doesn't make the game bad; I've played countless games that are short, but have loads of charm and memorability to me, and this is among my favorite. I've actually played through the game three times at the time I write this, once on Impossible Mode. It's a heavily enjoyable experience and I've actually found a few funny bits that I missed on my first playthrough.The combat system is very simple. For the most part you have to mash a single button to beat enemies down, and hold down another to activate a temporary shield. Some of your guitar-weapons, however, have special effects to aid in combat.Another enjoyable aspect about this game is that it makes no darn sense. As the plot unfolds you're asking yourself just what the heck you're playing, and it kept me entertained the whole way through, what with Bunny's singing episodes and Gunny's overuse of the word ""Yes,"" which I have begun to take up when I type to people.Many of the levels are linear without a whole lot of exploring, but I can guarantee you'll get a laugh out of the game at least.Also, the developers are very involved with this game, and they will be very responsive to almost any question or concern you may have. A few updates have come out already fixing certain bugs, and I feel the developers are doing a great job. A sequel is possible, and I would love to see that; that's why I hope more people will learn about the game after reading this review.Even at full price, this game is entirely worth it. Whether it's for the humor, music or gameplay. It's a strange yet fun adventure filled with wonderful characters and a great sense of humor. It may be short, but think of it like a Jolly Rancher; so small, but bursting with delicious flavor. Boo Bunny Plague is a fabulous gem worthy of more attention.I recommend this game, yes."

The play mechanics are very simple (only one attack button!), but the many mini-boss fights require figuring out a different strategy, so there's variety that way.

The boring levels are for the most part forgivable, as the player knows they are working towards the next interesting boss fight or funny musical interlude. My main criticism is that the combat lacked depth and level enemies didn't vary enough. For the price Boo Bunny Plague is definitely worth a play through and has earned 6 out of 10 from me.STORYI actually really enjoyed the crazy storyline of Boo Bunny, and loved the ridiculous face-offs against some pretty famous gods of Viking mythology. I have to reinforce though, this game is a musical as well as an action adventure, and for the most part the songs littered throughout the game are very creative and funny, but occasionally out stay their welcome.GAMEPLAY & COMBATGameplay and combat in Boo Bunny, is simple, with the player being able to slip straight into this game and get the hang of it quickly. This straight forward control systems seems like a blessing initially, but soon becomes the weak point of the game. With a one button combo system, a difficult to use block mechanic, clunky movement controls and a touchy camera, things get stale quickly but this is alleviated slightly through some fun boss fights.Fighting against gods like Thor and Tyr are exciting, and the challenge in this combat is in trying to analyse the patterns and work out their weakness. I am torn about the control system in Boo Bunny Plague, on the one hand it is boring when implemented in each level, but when considered in the realm of boss fights it is still clunky but far more entertaining. I won't go into any more detail about the boss fights as they are the core of the game, but I will say there is one boss in particular that has a very clever design.VISUALSGraphically, Boo Bunny looks like an early cell shaded game from the PS2/Xbox era, though I am not sure whether this was done to make the game more feasible to create or as an art style choice. At any rate I think this dated-vintage look works for the game and apart from the odd clipping and collision detection issues I enjoyed the visuals on the whole.MUSICBoo Bunny's music is a central point of the game, and I found myself having a good chuckle through many of the songs. There is the option to purchase the deluxe edition, including the soundtrack and a couple of other goodies, but the songs in my opinion are a listen once affair, and are more entertaining when heard in context.For my full review and heaps of other delicious content seeGlitch"

But that's one of my only complaints, really.Boo Bunny Plague was a silly, fun experience. The game's combat style reminds me most of that one Simpson's title on the Wii, except that you're only ever armed with a guitar for close-range fighting. I enjoyed the game's soundtracks the most, consisting of goofy metal with lyrics that almost always put a grin on my face. The game's plot is anything but solid, but with a consistent wacky flow I just couldn't turn it down.If the game's on sale for a low price or if you managed to snag a coupon, I'd suggest purchasing this gem just to be able to see how much of a joyride it can be."

They give you so much at once and yet?? Not enough. I never REALLY know what's going on. The controls are okay, the voice acting is pretty decent (the jokes are not, mind you) and the only real fault I can point out is that a lot of the game is obnoxious. The characters and songs are obnoxious. Mostly Bunny. Bunny feels like if Deadpool was written by a 12 year old who was going through his ""lawl random"" phase and his ""Edgy OC"" phase at the same time. The mechanics of the game, bare bones, work fine. Not fantastic, but fine. I have a hard time with the story and the characters because they're either obnoxious or I don't understand what's happening. If I can't enjoy the decent-at-best game controls and mechanics because of the kind of bad world that you opted to put around said mechanics, then it's hard to enjoy anything about the game, aside from in an ironic sense.However, all in all, it's not completely awful. It's not a BAD game. It's decent. This is a case of ""You get what you pay for."" If this game were to cost more than like $5, then I would judge it a lot more harshly. It's decent. If it was possible, I would give it a neutral rating."

It's one of those games you'll have people go ""Wut?"" to whenever you explain it to them, but it makes them more interested in playing anyway.""Boo Bunny Plague"" puts you in control of a rather semi-insane animatronic bunny that has an adventure with his friends, namely a military gun robot, a semi-demon girl and an elephant man, battling gods and whatnot in order to get himself an Auto-repair unit. The premise makes no sense whatsoever, and will have you wonder what exactly it is you're playing most of the time, but it's not to an extent where you don't understand it anymore. Even though the game feels extremely illogical, it's never inconsistent, and especially the boss battles have a pattern that can be found and followed nicely. There were a few moments where I got stuck on where to go, but they were few and far between.The gameplay is very basic. You control the main character the same as any other 3D platformer/brawler, and only has two moves, namely an attack and a shield. At first, you won't be using that shield much, but in the end it'll be your best friend. You attack using a guitar, and you'll find several of them along the way, each with their own powers. Attacks are always basic, there is no true ""strong"" or ""heavy"" attack, but you will be getting a combo kind of idea when you attack an enemy multiple times.The graphics are incredibly average. I can't really say they're good, but they're not bad either. It kind of feels like an early Telltale game, with cartoony edges and lines displayed on the characters and the environments. It fits rather well with the whole setup of the game, and I enjoyed its style quite a lot.The music, other than the singing, was really good. However, if you're not a fan of (soft) metal or fast-paced rock, there might be a chance it'll put you off. Once again, the music compliments the overall game really nicely, and especially the boss battle music really did a good job at improving the gameplay.The game also features voices, and yet again these fit great with the characters. The main character Bunny has a voice that'll make you think you won't like it at first, being a bit naggy and over the top, but grow to love as you progress through the game. I personally love the voice of his sidekick Gunny, because it sounds exactly like it should with his character. The other voices are what you expect, nothing special but fitting, and there is one voice in particular that'll remind you of someone later on in the game.In conclusion, ""Boo Bunny Plague"" is as random a game as the name it's known by. Though you won't be getting more than a few hours out of it (3-4), your time won't be spent in vain as you'll be welcomed with a crazy story, insane characters and horrible yet lovable singing (and as another reviewer said, this is supposed to somewhat represent a musical). And with a price tag of 2 dollars, there's very little reason not to get it, though I suppose you could always wait for a sale.Rating: 7/10. Let's hope they'll release that sequel :)"

Now I have the actual paperback DC comic and when I read it, I was interested.  I kind of enjoyed Bunny and Gunny and the idea behind the story was pretty cool, especially to see in video game form.  Then I actually played it and well...For a beat-em-up, this game feels awful, clunky, and unpolished.  It feels as if you're sliding on ice, and when you hit someone, it feels like your weapon is a foam noodle in the shape of a guitar while everyone else has something that can stun lock you for eons.  Then there's the shield meter, which honestly is a pointless gimmick because it doesn't really stop people from attacking until your shield energy is gone, leaving you with two choices.  Hit and run, or hit and get hit by everything else.How the story is executed is kind of irritating as well.  The jokes aren't placed well at times, voice acting goes from Dynasty Warriors bad to pretty okay.  Bunny, even though I like the character, got on my nerves quite often, and there felt like there were a fair bit of things that weren't explained in the game.Don't get me wrong, I would love to see a sequel, or even a remake of this game.  But only if they fix the awful combat they had in it.Oh right, the music was pretty good."

Not doing a formal pro/con thing.I bought the game and soundtrack on yet another ridiculous Steam markdown.  I think it was $1.49 for the combo.Ok, so, the best way I can sum up my review is this:  if you have no speakers or headphones, or if this game lacked all audio, it might *barely* be worth a dollar.  The graphics are fun, but pretty basic; if you're expecting AAA level characters, backgrounds, and animations, then you really gotta re-evaluate your expectations.  The enemy variety is nearly nil, as you're mainly dealing with a handful of Vikings, and a bunch of bosses.  The fighting system is meh.  Blocking seemed to be unnecessary for most of the game (except for boss fights, which is actually most of the fights).  You have a guitar-sword (a selection of them, really), and you can jump.  But jump-strikes don't seem to do anything special.  No distance weapons, either.  You also get your ""friend,"" Gunny, who will jump in and shoot on occasion.  Gunny's kinda cool.  Like a weaponized version of Pintsize from the online comic Questionable Content (though it's possible I'm the only one who sees a similarity).Now, re-enter the reality in which you have working speakers and/or headphones.  The audio completely makes this game.  The soundtrack is an absolutely great match for the style.  The writing and voice acting is great.  It's good, on its own merits, but it's damn near perfect for the feel of the game itself.  And the writing is great.  Very creative, very clever.  Irreverent may be a bit too understated.  The characters are generally well-crafted, though I will say that Faye could have used more development.  She's an interesting character, but could have used more backstory.As an aside, as weird as it is, the game made more intuitive sense to me because back in the days (ok, two decades ago) I became obsessed with a PC title called Hammer of the Gods, by Holistic Design/ New World Computing.  That game seriously deserves a re-boot for this generation of PCs.  But I digress.Here's the bottom line.  I paid $1.49 for the soundtrack and game.  I don't know if the game would be worth the original $5.00 asking price in terms of gameplay, but I think it's worth the asking price to reward the creators and publishers for releasing something this creative and original, and as encouragement to make a sequel.  (On second look, the original price might have been $2.00?  Really?)"

,Not Recommended,313590,15178637,"Posted: 2 April, 2015",all,Sheep!,"While it's true that one should offer more leniency when reviewing an indie than when considering a big-studio product, Boo Bunny Plague doesn't feel like an indie game; it feels like a game-development student project that accidentally got a commercial release.First, and most importantly, there isn't much actual gameplay here.  It's ostensibly a 3D third-person beat-em-up with a bit of platforming and frequent boss battles.  But all of those elements are pretty sad.  Combat is primarily mashing the fire button to flail madly whenever an enemy is in range, and running around to collect the respawning health bonuses.  There's also a recharging shield, but it's hardly worth using outside of certain boss fights.  The levels aren't very well designed, the graphics are minimal and the attempt at platforming is sad.  The boss fights are the best part of the gameplay, but even those are far from spectacular.  A couple of the boss fights rely on gimmicks that aren't made obvious -- in a better game, there'd be more temptation to return to the fray and puzzle out the secret, but in Boo Bunny Plague, it doesn't feel worth the effort.Despite the terrible gameplay and shoddy graphics, Boo Bunny Plague does have some strengths.  It's a comedy game and a musical game.  And in terms of humour and music, it has some strength -- just not enough to make up for its other failings.  What's more, the quality of the music and humour is decidedly uneven.  Some of the songs are worthy, but others make you sit through something that should have been left on the studio floor.  Similarly, the jokes range from some genuinely amusing twisted surrealism, down to crappy unimaginative one-liners trying to pass for wit.  A harsh editor with no tolerance for sophomoric crap could have done the game many favours here by paring it down to the genuinely good material.Bottom line: some of the people involved in this project on the writing and musical sides showed genuine potential, but not nearly enough to redeem this sad, shoddy, half-baked little pile of failure."

While this game is seen as finished, it certainly doesn't feel finished, which makes me sad because I actually really like it. This game is very glitchy, a bit broken in feel and needs more work done on it. The frame rate is not consistent, which makes you feel like you're either not going anywhere or you're teleporting all over the gosh darned map. Cut scenes have cut themselves off before in my playing. I only know this because the subtitles are too fast (I have bad hearing, so it helps). The main problem I have is that I like this game despite how flawed it is. If the devs were to just polish it up, it could easily become a much better game. In short, don't buy the game unless it's at least 50% off like I did. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this train wreck, despite the fact that I do really like it because there are free, unfinished 3D games made with unity that run better than this oddly enjoyable game. So what I'm trying to say is save your money by waiting for a sale, but if bad controls frustrate you, don't buy it at all unless the devs polish it up."
,Recommended,313590,25432787,"Posted: 9 September, 2016",all,math823g,"TL;DR: I definitely recommend this game, but only if you really like games that are funny and do not mind simplistic gameplay.Plot: You are a singing robot bunny named Bunny who is on a musical quest to earn money. This somehow involves beating up religious figures.Pro: The humor is really strong. It basically carries the game.The music and voice actors are also really good, which is also important since it is a comedy musical game.Later bosses are quite interesting.Mixed: The game is very short. This can be a bother, but as the game is quite cheap, you do get your money worth. This is especially true when the game is on sale.Con: The gameplay is very simplistic. It's really just looking at an enemy and holding the mouse button until the enemy dies.Is mostly a boss-rush game, which is made less interesting due to the weak mechanics.The first boss fights are not that memorable.Overall: This is definitely the kind of game where the story and characters save the game from weak gameplay. If the game was more expensive, I wouldn't recommend. However, in this case, the game is quite cheap, and the humor and songs are very strong. It is quite obvious that while the developers may not be talented at gameplay, they are very good at delivering funny moments. Therefore, if you like funny games, you might like this game."
76561198116795299,Recommended,313590,25358426,"Posted: 4 September, 2016",all,Sir Real,"(Note: I've only played through the Thor fight, so my opinion might not be very credible. Also, SPOILERS for the first few minutes of the game.)I went in not quite sure what to expect. The opening where Bunny ran down the conveyer belt destroying other versions of himself was fun, though the pacing was ruined by the robots to the side shooting you and the Bunny bots on the belt that suddenly required more hits to kill. The fight with the T-Rex seemed like it would be epic, but it got boring once I realized I just had to run around it and spam the attack. After that the story was introduced and felt a little rushed. Meet a teleporting robot who's now your best friend (and maybe malfunctioning?), take a bounty hunting job to get money for an auto-repair unit, get into a fight that destroys a diner, and now the team is assembled. After that, the first real level is started and it feels so empty. Just a few buildings with two or three enemies around each corner. The combat system felt lacking as there's only one attack that you just use when you can get close enough to the enemies who will sometimes run away. I said Gunny is maybe malfunctioning because as you make your way down the streets, he'll just dissapear and reappear some time later with no explanation. Is the meaning here that he doesn't have full control of his teleportation? You find Nimrod who tasks you with killing some more enemies. While doing so, Bunny sings his hunting song. The emptiness of the level and how the enemies are spread out makes it obvious how repetitive and annoying this song is (which might have been the intent considering Bunny's character, if so, good job). After that, you can start the fight against Thor which was where the game really picked back up for me. The music was good for the level (even if the area was empty, just saying, some construction workers off to the side cheering for Thor would have been a nice touch). The fight itself was an enjoyable departure from how you fought the enemies prior. Though the method for beating him, hitting his hammer when he throws it felt a little broken. Sometimes it would still do damage to you, sometimes it wouldn't register the hit (unless it was just an issue with my laptop which is very possible), and sometimes the hammer would get stuck to Bunny which would do so much more damage. All in all, I still think it's a fairly fun game that I would recommend."
