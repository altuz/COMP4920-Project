It's not uncommon to have to click on a object 2-3 times to get the game to recognize that you've found something, which is pretty much a no-no when you're dealing with achievements awarded for minimal clicking.  The design of the story can also be prety frustrating here, and it's not intuitive compared to a lot of their other games.  Also, the achievements are a little lacking compared to A.M.'s other games... there's no tier of achievements tied in to the mini-game that substitutes for the hidden object scenes.  Perhaps most egregious of all though, is the fact that several of the objects in pictures are literally hidden COMPLETELY behind other objects.  No recognizable piece of the object sticking out, literally the ENTIRE object is obscured by something in front of it.  Which means in several of the hidden object scenes, you're going to end up just randomly clickling around hoping to find the object behind other objects.  If you want a great hidden object game, check out Enigmatis 2, Nightmares From the Deep: The Cursed Heart, or Abyss: Wraiths of Eden.  All three of those games are much better in their design.  Even Clockwork Tales, a smaller effort, feels of a piece with those three, and the sequel to Nightmares From the Deep, while not as good as the first, is certainly worth playing.  Time Mysteries 2 feels like it was designed by different people, from the cut scenes, to the structure of the gameplay, to the hidden object scenes themselves.  It's a bit frustrating when played after the standards set by those other games."

The hidden object scenes are nicely drawn, but it's often hard to find the objects because they're quite well hidden and undistinguishable from the others. Most scenes come with a color palette containing many shades of gold, orange or brown, and these can be incredibly difficult to complete. Nevertheless, there is a hint button that recharges almost instantly, in case you get stuck.The novelty that this game brings is the travel device that allows you to travel to important moments in your family’s past, and the actions you do will alter the future scenes. The device also serves as an incredibly helpful map - you have different symbols for the rooms you need to visit (those that have incomplete actions), for the unexplored rooms and for the scenes that change due to actions in the past. It also serves as a fast-travel device, even within the same time.I found the game very enjoyable and interesting, but I wouldn't recommend it to people that are beginners in this genre because the difficulty of the hidden object scenes will probably set them back.More reviews on theLilly's Corner Curator page"

Not my favourite Artifex Mundi game and I have played all of their games that are currently on Steam, but definitely worth playing by any fan of the genre.I should mention that apart from the game engine, which is very slick and for instance auto zooms when you need it to, it has the standard map feature which is present in all but one (the oldest) Artifex Mundi game currently on Steam which allows fast travel by clicking on the location in the map screen.The artwork is the usual high standard I come to expect from Artifex Mundi.The games main feature which sets it apart from other Artifex Mundi games it involves time travel, such that you have travel to the past, change something and then return to the present, or to a later time to advance the plot of the game.So in closing I would recommend the game, as I said not my favourite, but well worth playing and playing this game did cause me to purchase and play all of the other Artifex Mundi games on Steam which is a recommendation in itself."

And I have to admit, I'm quite enjoying this one.There's lots of moving back and forth to get various objects to complete tasks, and the 'time device' you gain quite early on can certainly assist in where you need to go to next, should you get stuck.A nice touch is the ability to swap to a mini game if you get fed up of the hidden object path.The only downside so far is the voice acting. it's very meh. As if the actors weren't being paid enough!!In general though, if you want a bit of a time waster game, with some light challeneges, and something that's not too mind bending to figure out, then this should do the trick."

There are a lot of locations to visit, so it's nice to have the map pointing out where I should go next.In the hidden object-scenes, some of the objects are actually hidden behind others :( And I got quite tired of returning to the same scenes over and over again.

It actually got a little tedious for me on this one. Other Artifex Mundi games have been a lot better about mixing up the puzzle games to keep things a little more interesting. The very few puzzle games that were not hidden object made no sense to me. I did like the story and I liked the time travel idea, and like all the A.M. games, the artwork is great. I'll recommend this one because it was good enough for me to go on and want to do part 3 of this story line, but unfortunately this isn't one of the better A.M. games. They could have made this a lot better."

The hidden object puzzles can be hard, but with persistance you can find everything without having to use any hints. This game is part of a trilogy and the first game isn't on steam as yet, this might have an affect on the story for those of us who haven't played the first game. I haven't played it and I still think this game is worth it, especially if you find it on sale. The puzzles themselves aren't overly complicated and if you are wanting a hidden object game I'd recommend you try this one out."

TM2 is a solid P&C/HOG with a decent story, 'okay' graphics, and acceptable VO (btw - I'm referring to the voice acting and not lip sync, which is often off). Mini games were the standard fare. I enjoyed the art and the upper-moderate difficulty level of the hidden object scenes. Also, know there's no storyline continuity lost by passing on TM1 and starting with TM2 (i.e., you won't be lost in the story by starting with TM2). The game played well on Linux Mint 18.The main issue I had with the game was regarding the high degree of backtracking required (which I don'tnecessarilyconsider a bad thing) in context of the configurability of the difficulty settings (two choices: Regular Mode or Expert Mode).I prefer to play these types of games without the active areas being given away by sparkle (or otherwise indicated by anything other than cursor change on mouseover). To achieve this in TM2, you set the difficulty level to 'Expert Mode'. So far, so good.The issue for me came later in the game when I wanted to see the map locations of the scenes with available actions (which requires you to be in Regular Mode - which turns the sparkle back on). As many reviews note, there's a lot of backtracking required in this game. And although you often know which items are required next, much of the time those items' location is not deducible, nearby, and/or apparent. Once you have all the levels and scenes opened up, there becomes a somewhat overwhelming number of possible locations (and many times there's only one action available at a time in the whole game). So your choice is to systematically backtrack the entire game (scene by scene - area by area) to find the required item in that one - just now made active by your most recent action - hidden object puzzle or switch from Expert Mode to Regular Mode to see the next available action (and then switch back to Expert Mode to turn the sparkle back off). This became tedious for me and I found myself wishing the devs had made the difficulty level more configurable.I get that this issue stems from a personal preference and may not bother anyone else. But I thought I'd mention it as it was the main negative I experienced. Besides that, I have no problem giving this game a recommend.PS I almost exclusively play offline. I typically only play online long enough for Steam to allow me to write a review. So Steam only shows that I played 0.2 hrs as of the time of this review, although I've played at least 8 hrs and have completed both games."

It wasn't just a go this room then this room point and click, it was a go here, then go back here and do this, then go over here. It was a little hard to figure out at first, but when you got the gist of it - very cool! The bonus pack was GREAT what an unreal twist to the game! Definitely liked this one!"

If you've played the first game, this can make aspects of the story confusing, but the third game in the trilogy connects all the games and ties up the loose ends. The gameplay and mechanics are more polished than in the first game, so that's a plus, and again the music is good. The Bonus Adventure is a nice addition to round out the story, and you can get more background from the encyclopedia entries as well.Just like the first game, however, this one doesn't work well as a standalone game due to literally ending with a ""To Be Continued"" on the screen. As with the first game though, I give it a recommend if you're a completionist who enjoys that sort of complexity and you're a fan of Artifex Mundi's other works."

The hidden object puzzles are extremely difficult - I play a tonne of these kinda games and get though them without hints, in this game I relied on them heavily. The voice acting is horrific, as are the other Time Mysteries games. I wouldn't bother with this game or the others in the series. They are way more difficult than they need to be, incredibly repeative and downright a waste of money. I only spent three hours in the game because I wanted to finish the darn thing."

And the puzzels are ok -I quite like that you can puzzel your way to get the items you do not find. BUT what I don't like is how it is.. not logical. So, I know that I need item x, but if for say it is milk, is it in any of the dining rooms?? Nooo.. So I keep having to go through each location, clicking everywhere to check if I get up any of the hidden objects games to Maybe get the item I am searching for. Like, from the bedroom scene or something. And some of these hidden objects games pops up at unlogical places (I am thinking about the tree house one where you click at a random leaf. Would never have found it without ""cheating""/using the hints.)  Very frustrating.As far as Hidden Objects go, this one gets 1 out of 5 from me.Ok sound, ok story, ok grafics, terrible game flow."

I tried hard to summon the strength to finish but the game unfortunately got on my nerves.Pros- The concept of time travelling to find and solve clues is great!- The artwork, as always, is good (not the best in this game but still looks nice)- The story seemed like it would be interesting from what I played so far.Cons- The worst culprit by far is the female narrator. She drove me nuts! She narrates what is happening to her like she is reading the weather and it's going to be sunny all day. Not convincing at all and I couldn't even click through the narrative to shut her up (she really needs shutting up).- The HOS seemed too cluttered (yeah, I know they're supposed to be) to the point where I struggled sometimes to distinguish one shape from another.- The time travel tool gives you a ! which indicates an area you can explore/solve a clue next, but I got to the stage where there were no ! anywhere and for the life of me, I couldn't find the last item I needed to progress. I even consulted a Bigfish guide but gave up when I couldn't find a solution.Sorry, Artifex Mundi. I love and have played most of your other games but this one is not your best.Hala xxxP.S. Please don't use the same female narrator again. She was awful :("

Entertaining, in a way. I had already played a similar one and, for the price (I got it on sale, of course) it wasn't bad. Hidden object scenes are beyond boring, but I knew what it was before I bought it. Also the mini-games that you can escape to are boring, but that's not so bad either.Not so cool that you can't save your game, then go back and correct something or do it better; the game saves its own progression and puts you back where you were everytime you log back in.What unleashed my fury:I finished the game and started the bonus adventure, called ""Save Esther"". I was in the doing a puzzle and decided to close the game to continue later. When I wanted to come back to the game, my profile disappeared, so all my progress (meaning, the entire game) was completely gone. Now, if I want to go back to where I was, I have to play it all over again.Sure, it's a very short game; I played it all in 3.5 hours (plus a few times that I left it standing by to go eat or whatever), but do you think that means I want to do it all again, just because the game had a stupid hiccup and lost all my progress?So, you can either STAY AWAY from this game and go buy something cooler, or get it on a really cool sale (I wouldn't pay 2€ for this) if you really really really like hidden object mixed with point and click puzzles."

There's a really stronger focus on HOS than puzzles in this one (16 different scenes and you'll visit most of them 2 or even 3 times). Story was average but flow was good. Extra chapter really goes down a notch in terms of quality especially cutscenes.
,Not Recommended,313650,16155809,"Posted: 3 June, 2015",all,Mickmane,"I haven't played Time Mysteries 1 yet.I like these games for the puzzles (mini games), I would be happy with just them and no Hidden Objects and no story. Most of the time, the rest is fun too though. Here not so much.The hidden object scenes are a bit too difficult for my taste. Some things are really hard to find. The sparkling thing that helps find some objects is always in the same spot for HO where you don't combine things. (Edge of inventory, pointing at leaving the scene.) In scenes where you combine things, it stays stuck on an already solved part of the combination.The alternate to the HO games is great though. A different kind of matched-blocks-disappear game. That adds a lot of replay value for me. Too bad it doesn't count for the achievements for hidden objects, so I have to play them anyway if I want that.The story... At the start, in the mansion, it somehow didn't feel like a whole place, but more like disconnected, unrelated rooms. The immersion I am used to from other games, including other Artifex Mundi titles, was missing. Maybe it was the setup for the story. Too little reason to go there, nothing urgent.The jump-to-room-and-time function is great to save manually walking around,while I had it, anyway,but here it increased the above mentioned feeling. Without any real goal/coherence, I ended up just ticking off of exclamation marks from the device. Maybe that it didn't show where I was added to the feeling of being detached from the whole story.The puzzles (mini games) could use an explanation on what to do. I had to find a guide for the disks and knobs thing because there was no indication of what to do with the discs. Same for some puzzles in the bonus chapter.So, with all that, the only part I can recommend it for is the alternative to the Hidden Object games, for those who like those types of games.Edit: It seems the alternative is not available via extras, so I'd have to play the story through again to get to those games.

Except for the creepy lip movements from an elderly lady at the very end.There are some appreciated attempts to make the game lovable, you know, a bit closer to actual life than they tend to be  - like some passers-by when you look down from a window, or gossiping ladies in the street.I can honestly say I laughed at the ending with it's 'men-in-black' wannabe thing. All in all, a nice game, mostly focused on hidden objects scenes. The plot is ridiculous, but logic in actions is OK, and the atmosphere and art are quite appropriate to my uncultured eye.

They also have very hard to find actions to find in order to show some hidden objects.This game is so bad and its illogical puzzles so annoying I uninstalled it without finishing it."
