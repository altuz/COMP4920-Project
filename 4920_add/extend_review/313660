At its heart it is very simple and the age engine itself is Imo much easier to learn than some of the Clausewitz games e.g. HOI3. True the tutorial does not explain enough and formulating strategy is the main difficulty and can be very complex in the generally bigger original scenarios. Some of these are quite formidable multi-front affairs  (for these its best to look at the AARs on the ageod forum/youtube). Hence I would advice to get most of the dlc, especially BOR, Spartacus and Parthia. These are smaller, easier to manage affairs generally. (Hannibal is great too, but 2nd Punic war is quite big) (Cantabrian wars is hard). The AI can make mistakes e.g. placing its main army in cities that can fall at a stroke to a successfull siege, and other supply stuff, but overall it is pretty capable and can be a worthy adversary/ and can win sometimes.But what I really enjoy about these strategy games is how much history I have learned from them. Like whether Pompey was right to go to the East and the pros/cons of adapting the corvus boarding devise to the Quinqereme ship. I also love the alternative history (but based on facts) Caesar's revenge scenario against Parthia (easy Roman whitewash :) ). I cannot emphasise how much it has taught me and makes me want to read more. In summary a true Roman game for true Romans :)"

I have lost many a glorious hour in the maps and stat screens and menus of this game, now its finally on Steam.If the strategic aspects of Roman warfare, such as logistics, army movement, stances and numbers appeal to you; if you were disappointed by the lack of strategic depth and authenticity in Total War Rome 2 or the shallow military aspects of EU Rome; you owe it to yourself to give this game a try. Actually at this price... any strategy gamer should give this game a try.AGEOD veterans will be right at home. Others may need to look at a few Youtube tutorials and playthroughs.

If you can't be bothered reading the manual, this type of game is not for you.I had some initial problems, but I watched Exxar and Charles Cummings on youtube and read through the manual and now I love playing this game. I can spend 20 minutes planning a turn which is why I am not bothered by long end turns because the tension really builds.If you have some issues with jerkiness at full zoom out just check the forum because you fix it by changing one setting.This is a fantastic strategy game for this era.

I would say, it is the best game of the Roman period  on a strategic and operational scale.  The standalone titles are pretty nice, especially BoR and PAR.  Supply routes and weather conditions are substantial part of the the game, the command chain is well done and leader abilities can change the course of war.Where light is , there is shadow. The worst on this game is the unstable engine, especially, if you run other programms in the backround. Furthermore you can search a long time for opponents, if you don't register in Ageod's Forum, which can be difficult, because there are constantly error messages, when I have tried to register and wrote four damn  letters to them, but they don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about it, so I would suggest, you better try to register BEFORE you buy this game, because once you learned it, the AI  will be no challenge and no fun at all and if you don't know anyone, who play it, you find yourself in a ugly situation.What is the final score? I would give the game 8/10 ( 10-2 points because of stability issues) and 0/10 for Ageod Forum. Since it is concerning the game, because there is no pbem server, I would take it in the multiplayer part and my final rating is 8/20."

I remeber buying the DVD version of it (those were the days!) playing thru the tutorial, a big WTF and then I didnt touch it for 3 years. Then I got somehow back into it, checked the amazing Ageod forums and became a lifelong addict to anything Ageod ever released. This is the best company for lovers of history ever. You will feel the pressure that  generals back then felt. Dont be discourged by the apparently steep learning curve, check the forums (the BEST gaming community out there) and the youtube videos. Theres an excellent tutorial AAR by Narwahl and Loki that teaches everything as well as an incredibly detailed Chalres Cummings youtube series out there. Once you learn one game, youre pretty much ready to tackle any of these company's games. AJE has a somehow simplified supply/OOB structutre that makes it the ideal Ageod to start with. Totally immersive, extremely detailed, this is for real hardcore armchair generals ony. But once you get into Ageod, you will barely find the time to play anything else!"

Tough to get into. I myself played it and abandoned it lots of times (been playing a non steam version for the past 3 years). Howver, the developers dont really support the old games when the new AGEOD titles come out. Thus, dont expect paradox/taleworlds kind of mod support or dev support. This is the only dissapointement. THe developers actually make no attempts to make it more enjoyable for th community. They probably believe that people who're hooked into strategy wargaming to this level of realism (I havent found anything more ""real"" till date) have no option but to eat out of their hands."

One of the best roman games i played, and on sale with all dlc its not that pricey. The game is largely about logistics, since you don't personaly fight the battles yourself, but has a lot of strategic depth. It also has just the right about of scripting to keep as acurate as possible to history, without feeling railroaded. However, if your expecting a top notch graphics game, or something more sandbox like, then this is not for you.As for performance, this game has never crashed for me, it lags if your really zoomed out on the map"

There needs to be a mod or DLC that changes the turn length to a week or so might make this game believable.Old review -Boring and generally a bad design, but it gets points for trying. There are so few real (non-RTS) based strategy games, you could give this one a try. The game is complex and deep, but, by far, the biggest challenge is overcoming the game design. DO NOT PLAY FOR HISTORICAL ACCURANCY. The names, dates, and locations are accurate, but the game play isnt. Ai runs single units around like mice, 30 day turns are used to help AI seem smarter, senarios are made with pre-planned outcomes (no what-ifs). Some of the senerios play out as if it has scripted AI. If the senario wants the AI to get to a town, your army will stop moving. In my current game my army is plotted with a 28 day move up only moves one zone per turn just so the AI can get ahead. IF my army is limited in some way the game should not display my total move as 28 days.I would have returned this game, but I am over the time limit. I recommend people to play for 30 miuntes and if you have ANY doubts, return it without a second thoughtEdit #2: Most importantly, the game is unrealistic and feels broken because of the one month turns. You can have an enemy army on the other side of a river and you decide ""I will attack"". It might take 2 days to cross the river. Once you end turn you will waste 30 days to start the battle. If the enemy retreats one zone, you are 30 days behind. The Ai will detatch units and run them around your flanks and run across a dozen zone before you can even engage one of their units. No general in history stuck to a one month plan no matter what. This alone makes the game unhistoric. In one of my turns I was determined to use all of my 30 days of my turn and I ran my army around in a circle. This was one of my single greatest turns because I caught so many 1 and 2 unit armies that the AI made.It is unbeliveable to think that Caeser would say -""Ok troops we are going to march North for 30 days."" Sergent says -""North Sir? The scouts say the enemy might be on our west flank."" Caeser replies - ""Well we will march for 30 days and see what happens after that."" THIS WHOLE GAME IS BUILT AROUND SEEING WHAT HAPPENS AFTER 30 DAYS HAVE PAST.The game does not make it clear what is important and what isnt. And things that are important are not emphasized. The UI is a pain and is not clear. It took a bit of reading in the maual to figure out the ""build"" button was actually a little Eagle figure that looks like UI artwork, not a button. I just count that the UI has about 56 differnent elements and all of them look like boxes or buttons, execpt two. WHY JUST THOSE TWO?  Its like they got toward the end of the design then saw the UI looked ugly without art work, but simultaneously realized they needed two more buttons. Game designers - ""Hey lets throw the players a curve ball and make these two artwork pieces actually buttons! PROBLEM SOLVED!""While playing the first campaign after the tutorial, I have got to a point where all of my armies are immobile (""not active"" in game terms) and I cant move anything, and the game does not make it clear why. Obviously there is a reason, but darned if I know it. It is bad when I have to fight 6 armies in this campaign and I cant move any of my own.Edit #1: Forgot to mention how hard it is to read the text on some of the windows. Tiny black text on medium gray background. I cant tell if it is the text reading or the game that is giving me a headache."

Generally speaking it has all of the necessary components for a historical wargame. The battles themselves are quite hands off, the game focuses on the logistics leading up to a battle and then the calculations are made. It seems reasonably well researched, though it's more of a spreadsheet than an immersive experience as a Roman general/politician/powerbroker.However, what leads me to caution others about the game is the extremely poor optimization. The load times are bad, things get kind of choppy and unresponsive, and it just makes the whole experience a drag. You know this game is going to be a time investment to learn, and that poor optimization is going to drag the whole experience down as it aggregates. In this day and age, the discerning wargamer doesn't mind playing a game that could have been made in 1994, but it is expected to run fast and stable. As such, I cannot reccomend this game, unless you are an absolute fanatic of either Roman History or historical wargames.I will happily change my review to a reccommend if they improve the optimization. Until then, stay away, especially at retail price."

However, the game is not for me.  Overly complicated management systems are fine when they are less obfuscated.  The tutorial teaches you the very basics, and then you are thrown into a set up limited turn scenario where you cannot waste turns figuring things out.  I cannot figure out how the economy works.  Some of that may just be that I am currently playing multiple games and don't want to spend the hours trying to learn it.  There are only a couple lets plays, and they move pretty quickly and either don't explain, or spend 15 minutes explaining the history of a feature in Roman civilization rather than how it functions in game.  I get it, some REALLY love Rome. I enjoy but not on that level.  Basically, I learned the paradox games no problem, but this one remains vague.To top it off, the game engine is a pig.  You resolve a turn, and the game basically freezes until you get to a battle screen.  Turns take 30 seconds to a minute depending.  I hear that the game this engine is from ""Pride of Nations"" was much worse.  I really want to try the Civil War 2 game based on the engine, I am just afraid at that price that I won't be able to learn it.  I have limited gaming time these days with kids/wife etc, and don't want to spend a week of gaming time learning a system.The game looks nice, although I have to play in in a crappy low res because the ffonts are so small I couldn't read it.  The game is all about reading text and figures, and I couldn't.  Not only size, but the particular font didn't blend well with the backgrounds thru my tv.  I play paradox games at 1080 with no problem, so I'm not exactly blind.I applaud the developers, and I'm sure there is a really nice game here.  For me, as a moderate wargame tactical fan, it is just too much when coupled with the bad UI and long turns that you cant even scroll the map during.  If I ever find the impetus to learn the game and put some time into it, I may change my vote.  Not bad, but not for everyone.  Romanophiles and serious warsim people may enjoy a bit more, or if you have some experience with the engine, which I do not."
