After all, the game is advertised to have full controller support :)________________________________________TL;DR: This game builds upon Lego Batman and DC Super Heroes. It improves controls and visuals, and offers a new, unique story. Combine this with a change of scenery, and you’ve got yourself a hit.I’m not going to say much that others haven’t already said. But to sum it all up, this game is like “Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes” on steroids. All the classic features that made people love this game are present. That “Batman: Arkham City” style free roam. The “brain friendly” (detect sarcasm here) puzzles that made “Lego Indiana Jones” a hit. The powers of all your favorite childhood super heroes. And now, a story worthy of the game! If you’re like me, and have played any (or all) of these titles, you’ll get a major de ja vous.The last two Lego Batman games were astounding, but this ramps up everything to a new level. As mentioned above (in other reviews), the graphics in this game are improved. And when I say improved, I don't mean a tiny bit, I mean A LOT. I know this might not be the best comparison to make here, but if any of you have ever played Minecraft with the R3DCraft resource pack and/or Shaders (SEUS) mod enabled, you might have an idea as to what I mean. For those that haven’t played Minecraft (haven’t played it seriously, I mean) try googling images of the Shaders mod. It’s a night and day difference between the standard shader pack. While the difference between “Beyond Gotham” and “DC Super Heroes” might not be quite THAT drastic, I think my example gives an accurate portrayal of how much better the game not only looks, but feels. And keep in mind, Lego Batman 2 was NOT a bad looking game. The change of scenery doesn’t hurt either. I love the fact that this game takes you places you don’t often get to go in the DC universe. It’s really quite refreshing. Honestly, I think that this game rivals even “Arkham City” in terms of the best Batman game. Well, that might be pushing it. But one thing’s certain: It’s certainly a great deal better thank “Lego Marvel Super Heroes”! :DIt sometimes boggles my mind; why make such a great title a Lego game? But in actuality, I think it’s that fact that makes the game as enjoyable as it is. For any newbies, don’t let the fact that it’s a Lego game discourage you; this game is definitely worth the play. I know as well as anyone that the constant sales sometimes, or often, make us want to spend no more than the price of a sandwich on a game. But this is one worth full price. Honestly guys, you should have picked up the Premium Edition yesterday!P.S.  “Lego Batman 4: Justice League” anyone? XD"

,Recommended,313690,12983286,"Posted: 17 November, 2014",all,ChaseS19,"Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham is a solid Lego game for better and for worse. Sporting over 100 characters and numerous locations, Lego Batman 3 has to be the most expansive and diverse Lego game to date. However, platforming is still frustrating and at times it all just seems so overwhelming and underwhelming at the exact same time.Lego Batman 3 from Traveler's Tale interactive is the 4th game in the Lego video game franchise to feature DC comics’ characters. The title “Lego Batman” is incredible loose at this point especially after 2012’s Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes added a bulk of the Justice League to the line-up. The story starts with Batman and Robin as they chase Killer Croc through the sewers of Gotham City. Meanwhile, the Joker, Lex Luthor, Solomon Grundy and Cheetah invade the Hall of Justice in order to take over the Watchtower, the Justice League’s space station.Soon after the Justice League bring their villains under control in the Watchtower earth is invaded by Brainac who has stolen the power of all the Lantern Corps’. Using these powers, Brainac shrinks the earth and the Justice League and their villains have to work together to save the earth and free the Lantern Corps’ power.The Lego franchise of video games have never bolstered a great story and the same goes for Lego Batman 3. The story primarily serves as a means to bring all of the DC comics diverse characters together. However, cute, clever, or down-right goofy events allow for fun and exciting moments. Early in the game Batman, under the control of Brainac, begins tearing apart the Bat Cave. I played as Alfred through most of the encounter and giggled when I got the chance to beat up Batman as his butler. Moments such as that are the highlights of the franchise.Lego Batman 3 offers the same simple cooperative option as the previous titles. It is still fun working out side quests and free play mode of the story with another person. It also makes exploring the multiple hub worlds easier to manage. However, the dynamic screen split that started in Lego Indiana Jones is still confusing, but the option for a fixed screen split is still available. The co-op mode still remains the best way to truck through these games. It will always be more fun to bring a friend with you in the story missions.Outside of the main story, Lego Batman 3 features several unique hub worlds to collect new characters and golden bricks (the trophies of the franchise). In the previous Lego titles Traveler's Tale has pushed to feature large open worlds that the characters need to explore. These huge worlds were overwhelming at best and rage inducing at worst as it made tracking down side quest difficult and confusing. Lego Batman 3 breaks away from that by only having a handful of hub areas that are incredibly easy to navigate. Side activities no longer feel as much of a chore now that the player can easily bounce from one to the next.The side quests and who assigns them to the player is the real highlight of the game. From the expected characters such as Booster Gold and Aquaman, to unusual like Ace the Bat-Hound, Conan O'Brien and writer/director Kevin Smith. The game even features a prominent role from the Green Loontern, Looney Toons’ Daffy Duck with the powers of the Green Lantern. Traveler's Tale has gone out of their way to offer the silliest and most surprising cameos in this game. Seriously, the Bat-Cow is in this game.The best and most surprising cameo in the game is a collectable that is devoted to Adam West. In the various story missions and hub worlds Adam West is in trouble and the player has to rescue him. During the first story mission I heard, “This is TV’s Adam West and I’m in trouble!” and I became immensely giddy. However, to save Mr. West I needed a character I had yet to unlock which was annoying and frustrating to encounter in the first mission.The Lego games have always locked away secrets and goals behind unlockable characters, but this game seems to handle that in the worse ways. After completing the main story I had only completed 20% of game and was only able to unlock maybe 10% of the secrets hidden in the main story. The franchise has always been about replayability, but it would be nice to at least end the story unlocking more of that contentThe Lego games have always had a fatigue associated with them. I love this series and have played a majority of the titles, but I have yet to 100% one of them. The Lego fatigue stems from a bloated run time and story missions that feel far too long. Story missions in this game took me between 45 minutes to an hour each and the thought of having to truck through one again for a single unlockable adds to the fatigue. I burned 24 hours in this game, but I doubt I will spend much more time in Lego Batman 3.Excluding the bloated nature of this title I do feel like the franchise is improving. The platforming in the game is still terrible like all the previous Lego titles, but there is far less emphasis on jumping puzzles. Flying characters such as Wonder Woman and others are unlocked early in the story missions and aid in the navigation of the worlds. This is better than Lego Batman 2 where I had to wait till the very end of the game to unlock Wonder Woman.Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham is proving to me that Traveler’s Tale is improving the franchise. The game is fun and a nice diversion during the crazy video game season that we are currently in. It is great for kids, a good time sink for any adult and almost a must play for any DC comics fan who will get excited at the thought of playing as Wonder Woman disguised as Cheetah. I am mainly referring to myself of course. Oh, and when you fly as Wonder Woman it plays the theme song to the 1970s Wonder Woman tv show! That detail and others make Lego Batman 3 a game worth playing."

NOTE: This game's free roam is NOT like LEGO Marvel or LEGO Batman 2. There is no large city or area to mess around in. Instead there are multiple small locations and planets that are free roam-able. This is similar to LEGO Indiana Jones. I bought this thinking that I would be able to fly around in Gotham as Superman but this is not true. This is a very good LEGO game, but if you are looking for more replay value LEGO Marvel has more."

76561198168088787,Recommended,313690,13921129,"Posted: 10 January, 2015",all,mermaidaura,"As I write this review the Arrow DLC still has yet to drop so I'm basing this on having 100% this game with the current three dlcs out with the season pass.  First and foremost let me say how much I hated the storyline in this game.  For me it was the  worst of all the lego games I've played (the other Batmans, Harry Potter, Marvel, Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribbean, Lego Movie).  I will admit my biggest problem is that I'm not a big DC person.  I only like a few characters and Batman is one of them so when I buy a game called Lego Batman I expect the storyline to be promeniently about Batman.  This wasn't that.  This was Lego Green Lantern or Lego DC Universe but it wasn't Lego Batman.  I realize that they probably called it that to make more money but it really irks me.  Don't get me wrong I still had fun with the game, as I do with all the lego games.  I was just really looking forward to a batman centric story.  That being said I did not run into as many glitches as others have complained about.  I also played this game with the XBOX wired controller for Windows and never had a single problem with the controls as some other people have said.  The controller worked fine for me and I played all nearly 70 hours with it.These are the glitches that I did run into however:-The bat computer doesn't work in the bat cave to allow you to see levels and replay them even though Conan says it does.-When you run over a heart after taking out an enemy it doesn't always add a heart to your meter if you are low.  This is a problem I also noticed in Lego Marvel but not as prevalent as here.-When I was free playing the level Lantern Menance the game crashed on me three times.  There wasn't a checkpoint before each crash so I lost everything each time.  I had to save and exit a few times as well as start at a different point in the level then go back before I could get everything.  The game never crashed before or after this.  Only when I free played this level.-Some of the Quests glitched in various ways.-The rest were standard Lego glitches that are pretty much in every game.Ok so I guess this is where I'll go through my pros and cons:Pros:-All the suits in this game can be accessed by holding down the Y button if you're using a controller, once you find the corresponding token.  Makes things a lot easier when you need different suits, also if you place the character by where they need to do the suit change sometimes you can just hit the B button and it will automatically change to the suit you need.  I liked this a lot better than the previous games.-The Bonus Batman '66 level and the DLC levels which I enjoyed more than the game itself.  There's a lot of fun stuff there. Totally can't wait for the Arrow, Bizarro and Suicide Squad DLCs.-Geoff Johns, Jim Lee, Kevin Smith, Adam West and the Green Loontern are playable characters which is just awesome.-That they shut up Conan O'Brien in the last update so he only speaks if you walk up to him and hit the B button.  He's incessent talking was annoying before but you may want to talk to him the first time through just to get the lay of the land.-managed to finish the entire game in two weeks and sixty-seven hours which isn't bad for a lego game.-Voice acting was fun and good as it usually is since they started letting the characters speak.-There are a plenty of characters in this game so have ample combinations for free play, quests and races-There are many places to visit with quests and races including the bat cave (which has a room modeled after the batman tv show), the hall of justice, the watchtower, the seven lantern planets and a moon base-Each free play level is broken up into different sections so you don't necessarily have to start from the beginning-You can find unlocked red bricks in both the bat cave and the watchtower by going to the trophy room.  Much of what's in the watchtower is also in the bat cave so you can decide where you want to go.Cons:-This game has the fewest checkpoints I've ever seen for a lego game. This became a problem when I went on to free play as I mentioned above-Couldn't access any free play levels or characters that were unlocked until after you got so far into the story.  Once you were done with the story you could access unlocked vehicles in Oa, unlocked characters by holding down the Y button or visiting one of the Lantern planets and free play levels from the control room in the watchtower.  It could sometimes be annoying to go from one to the other just to unlock something, especially since the bat computer didn't work.-The map wasn't as good as Lego Marvel and when you got past a certain level in story mode you kept going back to the control room and had to find your next level on it.  I really didn't like that, it was a bit obnoxious.-there are no extra hearts or invincible red bricks in this game, which could have been useful, but there's a ghost stud collector... except there is almost no ghost studs in this game.  Pretty stupid.-VR Missions- I really hated these.  Almost threw my controller at my monitor a few times.  Need to do them to get some characters, vehicles and gold bricks though as well as complete a few missions. Was glad when they were done.Overall I like the game and do recommend it though I wish there was more batman but I believe the dlcs in this game surpass anything they've done in the others and I can't wait to play them all.  Below are some tips and suggestions if you are not the kinda person who likes that stuff stop reading here.Tips and suggestions:-I found the red bricks for the gold brick detector, quest detector & adam west in peril detector were very useful on the hub planets-If you are like me and like to get all the achievements then to get some of them do the following things: visit all the hub planets on a single gaming session; Jump on something 50 times in a row; the one with Krypto in the Man of Steel level you have to change both characters to Krypto; When you are in the control room there is a room to the right which you will need to go in for two of the achievements.-Wait until you're done with story mode to do free play, it's just easier-I found doing quests and stuff area by area worked best.-On your way to Oa for the first time inspect the moon instead of going through the grate. There's an achievement with cows that isn't too hard to find.-When in Oa I used the cars for the land races (Flash's Car worked best for me) but I used flying characters for all the air races because the planes flew like junk.  You just got to find the right one to use (Zatanna, Red Torando were among the ones that worked best for me) and may also have to boost the character in flight when the gates are farther apart.-Zatanna is good character to use on things because she can fly, blow up gold objects and go through grates.  Cyborg is also cool cause once you have the space suit when you double jump with him (no matter what suit he's currently wearing) he'll switch to the space suit and fly.Well if you've read all this you must have had a lot of time on your hands lol.  Thanks for reading and good luck!**UPDATE 3/20/2015** Since I wrote this review all 3 of the remaining DLCs for the season pass have been released. Due to space limitations I decided to combine my updates on these into one.  My favorite of the three was the Arrow DLC.  Good length, plenty to do and and a cool lego riff by Stephen Amell of his Arrow intro.  My least favorite was the Bizarro DLC.  It was really hard trying to figure out what you were supposed to be doing in that one.  Felt like throwing my controller at my monitor.  The Squad DLC was pretty cool but felt shorter than the others.  All the DLCs give you more cool characters to play around with so worth it for that reason alone.  Now I'm just counting down the days until Lego Jurassic World is released. Can't Wait!"

I have learned to live with that, but it just seems like it is worse in this game, mostly becuaseof the 7 hub planets you can visit, here the camera placement is so annoying it made the whole gaming experience a bit worse.Nonetheless, this game is awesome, and you should definitely buy it.

,Recommended,313690,15194062,"Posted: 3 April, 2015",all,Harley,"LEGO Batman 3 starts slow and then gets a lot better, and then overwhelms with so much content it's hard to be disappointed.I don't think I've ever played a game so clearly made with hardcore fans in mind. Not only is LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham a DC fanboy's dream come true (unless you happen to love one of the few characters not included), but also a LEGO fan's too. If you happen to fall into both categories, knowing, for example, both who Mr Plastic is and what LEGO master builds are, then you've hit the jackpot. For everyone else, this is another slick, content-packed LEGO game that will feel incredibly similar to previous LEGO games you've played.Dropping the open-world design seen in LEGO Batman 2 and the more recent Hobbit game, Batman 3 returns to a series of individual levels and a number of hubs and planets that can be explored. With a storyline that centres on the evil Brainiac's intention to shrink down planets, and the involvement of the Lanterns, an open world wouldn't really work. The result is a game that offers some lovely diverse locations, and a lot of fun, once it actually gets going.The opening few hours were a bore. Mainly set inside dingy locations or dull space station rooms, it all felt rather 'been there done that'. New playable characters were slow to arrive and the introduction of new suits for characters (giving them new abilities, such as magnetism, electricity, flight, etc) made for a rather prolonged tutorial. I wasn't feeling the love. It was another LEGO game, done well, but there was no spark. And then things suddenly got a lot more interesting.It takes a while, but once you're outside the game comes alive. Not only do the levels become more colourful (especially the Lantern planet levels) and clever in their design, but the characters can use their abilities more and the increased cast plays off each other very well.While the game is largely played from the same fixed camera angles the series has always used during levels, meaning you can't pan around to take in the environments, parts of Batman 3 look lovely. A couple of boss encounters really impress, as do a set of shrunken city levels that are entirely made of LEGO. Sure, this isn't a next-gen showpiece, but I paused on more than one occasion to take some snaps. Of course, the audio work here is brilliant, with top notch voice acting to deliver the humorous script, and all the classic music associated with the DC super heroes.Speaking of the DC heroes, LEGO Batman 3 can't help but suffer to the casual audience in comparison to last year's Marvel Super Heroes game. While Marvel is on a high at the cinema, unless you are really into DC you'll struggle to recognise most the characters here. Batman and the rest of the Justice League characters, along with some of the enemies, will be familiar faces, and if you've played the Arkham games you'll at least know some of the Batman friends and foes, but this will largely be a game of discovery for many players. That's not necessarily a bad thing, and you'll know going in how much fanservice here will excite you or go completely over your head.Designed for an audience so diverse in age (very young kids through to fully-grown adults with kids of their own), LEGO Batman 3 often feels like it can't quite be challenging enough. I'll admit to being stuck from time to time (entirely down to overlooking objects in the levels that needed to be destroyed in order to be built into something else), but the puzzles are borderline pre-school level and the mini-games are atrocious (aside from the shmup-lite sequences that resemble a super simple Resogun). A set of stages in which you have to run around Tron-like worlds are so poor I'm surprised they made the cut, and offer nothing other than tedium.If you're disappointed about the lack of open world, you can explore the Lantern planets via a moon base (Oa, for example, lets you drive vehicles around, but they all offer plenty to do along with the moon hub itself) and the hub zones (Batcave, The Watchtower and Hall of Justice) have so much to find that you'll be playing well beyond the end of the main missions. As is always the case in LEGO games, there are an obscene number of characters to collect, bricks to find and secrets to uncover. This is a massive game that will keep you (and a split-screen friend) happy for a long time if you're into collectables of the DC variety. Freeplay has always been a series staple and it's great here, and there's even a character customisation tool.LEGO Batman 3 starts slow and then gets a lot better, and then overwhelms with so much content it's hard to be disappointed. It's hard to get really excited about a game that feels largely similar to how the series started with LEGO Star Wars almost 10 years ago on the PlayStation 2, but DC and LEGO fans won't care as much about the sameness. For everyone else there's no doubt this is a classy package packed to the brim with content, but new ideas are definitely needed. LEGO Batman 3 eventually becomes very good but it's time the studio attempted to build a new mould.9/10"

Just not the one people were looking for...There are definitely a lot of characters to choose from, and that is a nice feature that I love. Some mechanics of the game and the story were disappointing. Some of the main heroes and villians, such as Batman, Robin, Joker...each has 8 different versions of them, each with unique abilities. Trying to remember who was which became frustrating. Of course, though, there is Cyborg. Cyborg is the most overpowered character in any LEGO game ever. He can literally do everything, and while it may be useful, I wanted to rely on more than 1 character to get the job done. Instead of me trying to widen my character range, I was stuck going back to one guy, over, and over again.One of the things that I really enjoyed about LEGO® MARVEL™ Super Heroes was the city of New York, which you could freely explore. In the second LEGO Batman, you could explore all of Gotham. This one sadly had a couple little planets, which you could fully explore in about 2 minutes. Something that really brought it down, as I love free roam.65 / 100It isn't the worst LEGO game out there, but its one that doesn't stand too high on my list. Too many features made it fall short for me. If you can get past the fact that there is really no Free Roam at all, and that you will rely on 1 character for just about everything, than you should give it a go.(SPOILERS) One thing that also really frustrated me with the story was the mission where the Joker dresses as Batman, and Wonder Woman as Cheetah, and it was just too confusing."

I love how much care is put into the characters. Characters like Frankenstein, Polka Dot Man, and Atrocitus are awesome. Giving other characters suits was really cool. This game had a better story mode than Marvel. The space ship shooter levels were fun, but it would help if the player's ship was easier to see. My favorite level was the bonus classic level based on the 1966 Batman tv show. Some of the ""virtual reality"" levels were fun, but some were not.There are a lot of characters, BUT I was really dissapointed at how many popular characters were left out: Raven, Starfire, Terra, Scarecrow, Power Girl, Two-Face, Doctor Light, Clayface, and more. WHY!!!?? The hub planets made me feel dizzy. I did not like having the horizon being so close because of how small the planet is (its like walking on a giant ball). Conan Obrien is really annoying after hearing him over and over again. The BatComputer does not work. The levels in the DLCs were terrible. The narrator with the australian(?) accent was annoying and weird. They made the scene from Dark Knight where batman stops the joker using his batpod a comic book cutscene. That was dissapointing. Instead you shoot at cars and make a crane. I really did not like all the wasted space in the hubs. Blowing up cars in the Marvel game city was fun, but there is none of that in this.What really made me mad was finding out that the TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY gold bricks that I collected did not make anything. No secret level door, no secret character or vehicle. Instead, it rains studs in 1 room. At that point in the game I had studs x6 unlocked and plenty of studs to spend, which means I got ALL THOSE GOLD BRICKS FOR NOTHING. Lego Lord of the Rings made use of gold/mithril bricks the best. Each one was used to make something. That is how it should be done."

Players are tasked with visiting the Green Lantern hub worlds and each one starts off the exact same way with a Daffy Duck-led tour of the planet followed by repeated treasure hunts. Wash. Rinse. Repeat. On all six planets. This is a stark contrast to Lego Marvel Heroes where the open world allowed for a more varied game experience. There is no ""open world"" in Lego Batman 3, just a series of hubs and levels. Worse, “invisible walls” exist in every level, taking away much of the fun of having a flying character by limiting his range and mobility.Minor glitches abound throughout the game, including NPCs with poor pathing getting stuck behind (or inside) objects and Lego Red Brick choices (minikits, gold bricks, character studs, etc.) either not properly showing the locations in the level, or showing white arrows above locations that were already discovered.Finally, the voice acting was atrocious throughout. Unlike Lego Marvel Super Heroes which maintained a stellar performance by all while still maintaining a fun atmosphere, the majority of the players in Lego Batman 3 seemed to have been told to ham it up with their worst superhero parody voices. The biggest offenders were Robin (Tim Drake), played as a cross between American Dad’s Steve Smith and the Cowardly Lion; Supergirl channeling an 80’s valley girl; and Joker by someone desperate to make you wish he was Mark Hamill. Luckily, Clancy Brown reprised Lex Luthor (the best actor who ever played the villain) and Tara Strong, Harley Quinn. The best voice over in the game was easily Kevin Smith as a parody of himself (#37-emblazoned hockey shirt included), although Conan O’Brien is worth a mention. Gilbert Gottfried earned a paycheck phoning in Mr. Mxyzptlk.Regular Lego gamers will also welcome the fact that Traveller’s Tales FINALLY made it so that Video Effects and Red Brick Extras settings are saved so you don’t have to turn them on (or off) every time you continue your game.Bottom line, this was another good entry in the Lego games catalog but nothing extraordinary.Lego Marvel Super Heroes is still the cream of the Lego crop."

There is a fair number of places where you can stuck your character without escape. The next step in the mission progression is sometimes unclear, or what exactly to do in order to interact with an item or a scene. Some abilities or scene let you control remote or tiny vehicles which open a new way to get stuck, or just lost when you drive in the dark...Obviously, those issues won't happen to everyone. But I ran into much much less issues with the preceding game in the LEGO Batman serie.The puzzles are very basics and not particularly entertaining (I prefered the ones from LEGO Marvel)Because of the story, everything is set to interiors. And they more or less all look the same. The feeling of repetition is coming quicker when LEGO Batman 2 offered fun moments driving in gotham city (when pursued by the Joker robot) or flying above the city (the Joker chase or asaulting the robot with Superman).The plus, you can play a expanded roster of characters, including some villains, during the main story. There are new suits. And there is a new story so you don't have to replay the previous game for your LEGO Batman needs.So you can get the game, be entertained (or in my case, have my kid boy entertained). Just don't expect the greatest LEGO Batman game or, actually, the greatest LEGO game even.--------------No support for XBox 360 controller.

76561198047867971,Recommended,313690,13018677,"Posted: 20 November, 2014",all,Captain Alex,"Feels watered down.It's a good game.I recently played Lego Marvel Superheroes, and to be honest this game does not live up to the standard of that one.For one thing there is no sandbox map, it is all made up of levels.From what I've heard, the former instalment in the series had all of Gotham as a sandbox map.This one is rightly so called ""Beyond Gotham"" but compared to a giant sandbox this doesn't really live up to its predecessor.There is a hidden Adam West 1969's Batman episode that I implore you to go complete since it is far more entertaining than the main campaign of this game.But the one thing that really bugs me about this game was the 'costumes' you can get for SOME characters (Batman, Robin, Cyborg, Joker and some others) because these costumes effectively renders entire characters useless in the game.Having only played Marvel Superheroes I'll use that as an example.Every character in that game had a unique function, well in this game several characters shares these unique functions which in other words means you won't need to swap around as much, but worse than that it also means that you'll never play as regular batman, you'll always be playing as 'spacesuit' batman, or 'diving suit' batman etc.Of course you have characters such as superman and the martian manhunter who does not have a single costume, which means they will stay as they are meant to, in their original image.I can see why they would want to do this, but the fact that several characters shares these unique functions, means that they are left behind useless.Good game, but not worth it's predecessor's reputation, nor does it make for a good competitor for its Marvel equivalent.Its Story campaign is also remarkably short compared to Marvel's Superheroes.I think it's worth looking into Lego Batman 2 rather than this one if you are planning on buying it, unless you are a very dedicated Lego games fan, and that goes for your kids as well of course."
,Not Recommended,313690,15673060,"Posted: 3 May, 2015",all,Captain Zaphod,"TLDR; No open world and for the most part stupid dialogue, pass on this one.I had the highest of hopes for Lego Batman 3. I love lego and the DC Universe and Lego Batman 2 was one of my favourite games of 2012. I had completed the first game to 100% and it was fairly by the numbers for a lego game, hub area and missions branching off of that, the thing I really enjoyed was the villain storyline, noticably absent from subsequent releases. Anyhow, trailers for Lego Batman 2: DC heroes unite hit the internet and I was super hyped, with promises of heroes from other DC books including the flash, green lantern and superman. I bought the game and it delivered in spades, but what I didn't know I wanted was the amazing open world hub of Gotham city, now obviously it was scaled down but it was all there, arkham asylum, ace chemicals, and nothing could beat the feeling of getting a mission and racing to arkham in the batmobile, or running through the city at ridiculous speeds as the flash, and flying with the old superman theme blasting away was absolutely stunning. My two gripes were however, even though we saw metropolis, it was not available for roaming around in and the other dc heroes apart from superman were introduced late and kind of an afterthought, but it didn't matter because I could fight crime as them in the open world. Inbetween the release of lego batman 2 and 3 there was an amazing game by the name of Lego Marvel Super Heroes, and I am less of a fan of the marvel stuff but it was incredible, new york city was huge with the baxter building and the sheild hellicarrier available to fly to or jump from. ""Okay"" I thought, ""how are Lego gonna up the anti in the new Lego Batman game?"" ""What's the subtitle again?"" Beyond Gotham, In my head this was going to be what Lego Marvel was but the helicarrier was the watchtower and we could have metropolis and coast city. But no. I bought the game on a sale as I didn't have the money on release, I played the story to the point where I could return to watchtower, and was dissapointed. ""Okay"" I thought ""I'll just beat the game and then we can see what we unlock"" not a single city is what. No patrolling gotham to kill time, no flying over in the batwing or chilling in the batcave before rushing through the secret door to the rescue. You can now access the suits anywhere by holding Y, now in theory I see this working for overworld fun, instead of having to place suits everywhere, you can just change on the go. But it doesn't work because batman with a jetpack is amazing in gotham city but boring in the hall of justice, so all it does is force the suits to require these charging stations which limit your use of batman with a jetpack in order to make the puzzles less easily solvable,  this creates a ""you can't tell me what to do feel"" toward the game because you have the suit, the game just won't let you use it. The writing is stupid save for some admittedly funny lines, braniac is not in the least intimidating and sounds like an annoying idiot who likes collecting things rather than the calm calculating evil mastermind he should be. Apparently batman thinks heroes shouldn't have emotions which is stupid for so many reasons but mainly because his emotion of greif for his parents' deaths and his love for the city and not wanting anyone to go through what he did, he becomes the batman. Don't buy this game, if you haven't played Lego Batman 2, go and buy it instead and if you have play Lego Marvel and if you have played both wait for lego batman 4 or lego marvel 2 because this one really isn't worth your money."

Once in control configuration select change device and tap a button on the controler and then the game should auto fill in the remaining buttions. finally click accept and you will be good to go.The main problem with this is while playing the game does not use the Xbox controller button colors and button referances like it will say use button 4 or 3 and not Y or X with its associated color which will be a problem for my kid.

This is a lego game like many others before it: go through the story, then go back through it again when you have characters unlocked to collect and unlock everything. I am a person who loves collecting things in games to get that 100% mark. Sure this doesn't have an open world map like Lego Batman 2, but I feel it doesn't affect the gameplay. I experienced very small amounts of technical issues, but these only occured post game, which was my favourite part of the game (the end game content, not the bugs). The only gripe that I had was that by the time I got to this game the music became very repetitive. The music changes a little between 1 and 2 but thats it. I've got no idea who most the characters are in these universes but nevertheless I enjoyed this game (and series) immensely."

I'd recommend for you to buy this game if you like collect-a-ton games or just LEGO games in general... IF IT WEREN'T SO BUGGY.I tried to play this game so much, but it freezes up for short instances (UPWARDS OF AROUND AN ENTIRE MINUTE), characters get stuck in walls or don't appear in areas they should, resulting in levels where you cannot progress because a certain character is unusable. The game hasn't crashed to desktop for me at all, but it doesn't like to minimize itself for no reason at all.I can't even pass the 5th level of the game because it's one glitch after the other preventing me to move forward or progress! Either its Joker getting stuck in a wall or Cyborg deciding to go out of bounds, I just can't pass the level since a bug will cause me to never be able to progress.This is such a charming and fun game too... But the developers/publishers were too lazy to bother patching the game up to at least prevent these game-breaking bugs but I guess WB Games already got their fill from the purchases of this game, so why bother?"

,Not Recommended,313690,22150774,"Posted: 30 March, 2016",all,PinkPony,"[New Review]: Batman 3 is no longer a Batman game, instead focusing on Green Lantern lore. There are only a handful of Batman characters you'll see throughout the story, and even then they all play miniscule parts besides Batman, who himself only plays second-fiddle at the best of times. Only two levels have anything to do with Batman, while major characters like Poison Ivy and The Penguin from the last games are nothing but unlockables with no helpful skills.There is no open world like Batman 2, instead letting you explore a number of sperical levels and three hubs, which isn't necessarily worse, but does feel very limiting. Vehicles are all but worthless, limited to a single level of gold brick races. The introduction of VR missions is very interesting, but fairly limited. The gameplay in general is exactly what you'd expect from a Lego game, though there's less of a grind for studs, but this just refocuses the grind on having to play levels multiple times to get everything, long after studs are worthless.This game has more bugs than any other Lego game I've played, both progression-blocking and crashing. It is also impossible to get 100% of the acheivements without buying all of the underwhelming DLC. And as much as I enjoyed the old TV series level and characters, Adam West is overplayed SO much in this game that it will stop being cute long, long before you're finished.If you want to play a BATMAN game, go for Lego Batman 2 instead.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Old Review]: Lego Batman 3 is a strange part-forward, part-side-step in the series. While clearly better than the first, Beyond Gotham does away with the vast, open world of Batman 2, instead giving us a handful of 'hub worlds', which are like a typical level comprised of a few rooms that you can free-roam around - much like the 'base' you have in any of the Lego games. Each hub has multiple side-missions and other 'mini-puzzles' to unlock bricks and characters, as you'd expect, as well as each having their own version of important rooms, like character creation, etc. - While this fits in with the story, it makes the game feel very small and confined, while limiting the sense of freedom you got from heroes with travel-powers.Batman 3 is a game for a different audience. While previous Batman games required only a basic knowledge of lore found either in Arkham games or the old movies, this game seems focused solely on long-time comic readers. There are multiple references that go over my head and many characters I've never heard of, and I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of ""oh wow!"" moments. In fact, most of these character-moments feel like they might as well have been OCs since they fall so flat on me.Another issue is that Brainiac's power to shrink things turns levels into the same all-lego style of the bonus rooms from previous games, which were by far my least favourite thing in them. Maybe I'm just not into lego as much as I should be, but fully-lego worlds feel completely devoid of charm of interest to me. Not only that, but the real-world locations weren't even close to accurate, which may seem petty, but it frustrated me, and was a missed oppertunity in my opinion.But to get to the real meat of the matter: This game has had more game-breaking bugs than any other Lego game I've played so far (and I've played plenty). At only 7 levels in, I've already experienced two bugs that required me to fully quit the game (and lose my level progress), as well as a bizzare one that made the game load extremely slowly, which was again fixed with a restart for no discernable reason. And this isn't counting the typical bugs you find in Lego games, just the progress-blocking ones.So in short: This game is for DC fans in general, but diehard fans specifically, which is a weird focus for something that is  allegidly a childrens' game. Almost all references here will go over a child's head, leaving them with little more than the slapstick humor and goofyness to enjoy... which is fine I guess, I don't really care. If you're into the comics, even the obscure ones, then this is made for YOU. If you just have a casual, pop-culture knowledge, then you'd better already be a fan of Lego games to enjoy this.I wanted another world of Lego fun to enjoy with a Batman twist, but instead I got a few connected rooms, 75% of the roster is either not Batman related or I don't know them, and an equal amount of frustration and fun so far. If this were LEGO Justice League I wouldn't be complaining, but a lot of the Batman characters I know and love are relegated to side-missions and nothing additional characters since, frankly, this isn't a Batman game anymore."

This really is just a Lego Justice League / Green Lantern game.Cons- I really disliked the flight mechanics. Sometimes you'd get stuck during races and thats just frustrating.- The 3D globe effect is headache inducing. The spaceship battles are tolerable.- The story wasn't as interesting as previous TT games. The old LEGO Star Wars games were funny and smart even though it didn't have any dialogue.- No open city. Would've like a Starling City or Keystone City to roam around in.- Conan O'Brian was annoying as hell.TL:DRMoney wasn't worth it. Get LEGO Batman 2 or LEGO Marvel instead

Well...  It's pretty much the fact that they removed something that was the part I enjoyed the most out of the few ones I played...So I'll just let it out, this game has NO hub world.I mean, yes, there's a hub, but it's nothing compared to the one in Lego Batman 2, which considering it's ♥♥♥♥ING CALLED BEYOND GOTHAM, it kind of goes against your expectations.Which really saddens me because... There's still so much of it that it's an improvement-I like the new designs-The humour's way better-Once you get a suit you don't need to find its platform to put it on anymore-Batman can glide without an special suit!-There's a flying theme for Wonder Woman now too!-Flying controls are much better now!-The new space shooting missions are a lot of fun... For the few there are...-There are way more charactersAnd yet, with all these new features, all I can think of is how nice it would've been if I could've enjoy them playing in a city hubworld or something like it.and by the way, even thought the fact that Wonder Woman has a flying theme is awesome at first, you get REALLY sick of it after a while, Why? Because since there's no hubworld, IT SOUNDS IN THE GODDAMN MISSIONS!!It really breaks the mood to be constantly changing themes you know, I'd say the same thing for Superman's since it's returning too, but you barely play as him during the story so it doesn't matter.You know, hearing it was in space, what excited me the most about this game was how we'd roam around it, going through space sounds awesome!... That was a big missed opportunity, Tt, It wouldn't been so hard, just do like with the hellicarrier in Lego Marvel, going up gets you to space (Trhough some load time I guess) and there you can see the planets there are to explore alongside the Justice... Space something (I'm sorry, I forgot its name) and flying towards one gets you to it (through another load time probably too)Sure, that'd mean each planet would have a smaller hubworld to fit in the game, but hey! It'd be way cooler than none at all!!If that wasn't enough, the planets you visit in the game are... Boring, you only go to the lantern ones and they're one color themes grow old really fast, I guess this was to tease Green Lantern fans after the cancellation of the animated series, or maybe the developers didn't had any idea of what other planet could they add, but it's still very underwhelming.It also helped me realize how... Boring the levels are over all, normally, it doesn't stick with me so much because I have this big hub world to explore that keeps me entertain, but♥♥♥♥♥♥ now the boring levels are the only thing there... AND THEY'RE BORING!!sigh, so... They also come and tease us with their approaching Lego Jurassic World in the credits, You know what? That sounds great!! Exploring the whole park, and if we get to play as some of the dinosaurs that'd be even better!!DON'T ♥♥♥♥ THIS UP!! TT GAMES!!"
,Not Recommended,313690,24605300,"Posted: 29 July, 2016",all,A very hot piece of Kek™,"Seeing how this game came 1 year after TT game's big seller Lego Marvel Super Heroes you thought they would have learned a thing or 2 about what people enjoyed in lego games.But apparently not.I guess a part of it comes from not being very set-in on DC characters since the characters i know i can probably mention on my fingers.But what mainly did it for me was the overall dull look.The DC movies and pretty much everything has often been dark toned and tried to be cool and taken very very seriously. Which means it translates poorly into lego worlds. It means the world just become awefully dark but without any sort of cool or interesting feel to them, it just makes the maps dull. The main hub you're left at too is something that's bad.While Lego Marvel Superheroes had a whole city to run around in with vehicles to choose and go around in and special levels to play through gates that you make with golden blocks, this game gets a space station. One that you can't even fully explore. Yeah, it got like 6 rooms in total. Actually, if you've played Lego marvel super heroes, let's say it this way. Imagine only being able to run around the helicarrier. That's what the space station is like.It has other worlds you can travel to,like the hall of heroes which is really just 1 room, with a hidden path that leads to the legion of doom, which is again. 1 room. They do give you all the lantern planets to play on, which sounds cool. Until you play them.These planets are so damn small, and so lacking of anything interesting that it's almost interesting how they managed. Not only are they a pain to walk on, (can't find a good way to describe it. Just look it up on youtube or something) they also give you the moon to play on. Which is pointless, there's nothing to do there. Except find portals to the lantern planets, but you can fast travel to them via your map which you carry around. Sooooo...The biggest offender of worlds though, must be the damn green lantern planet. This is the ONLY MAP IN THE WHOLE GAME THAT YOU CAN USE VEHICLES ON.And do you know what it is? JUST A BIG GREEN EMPTY ROCK WITH A FEW RACES THAT YOU CAN DO JUST AS WELL WITH CHARACTERS RATHER THAN VEHICLES.I thought the lego games were going to be interesting, but i was wrong. I completed this game to 100% like i do all my lego games, and while i sunk only 40 hours into this, it felt 3 times as long as Lego marvel super heroes, because that time i had fun, this time i didn't. I thought lego jurassic world was the worst offended of all lego games but no, this by far is.They even nerfed the combat.You heard that right. The big characters, they nerfed them. I remember playing them alot in Marvel super heroes because they were strong and easily dispatched groups of enemies in seconds, but this time, no attacks they do can target more than 1 enemy. Now, you might say ""But that's just so people won't use an OP character"" which would be fair. IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE GOD DAMN SUPERMAN IN THIS WHICH IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF OP.I really can't see anyone have much fun with this game, it feels rushed and overall dull.I do have to give it credit for bringing in Adam West as voice and character to find and rescue, but he's noStan Leeso to say, even if he on his own is a great personThe most fun i had with this game was whenever Mr. Mxyzptlk was on screen, because of all people. They choose Gilbert Gottfried to voice him, in a KIDS GAME. Sure he doesn't swear but, really?! Pretty much anything that guy says is ment to offend someone, so just hearing his voice is cracking me up because i hear curse words and offensive jokes just by hearing his voice even if he don't say them in this game. That's just hillarious."

Beyond Gotham goes even farther with tons of post-storyline quests and locations, different fight animations for different characters, and an amazing amount of voice-over recording.For me, though, my favorite thing about LEGO games is the humor, and I didn't find as much as usual in Beyond Gotham. Maybe it's just that I missed all the inside jokes (I'm less familiar with the DC universe than with other LEGO game topics). Normally, I find myself laughing out loud frequently, and wanting to show all the silly bits to friends. But my snickers-per-minute ratio was far below standard with this particular LEGO game.So, if you want hours of gameplay, especially co-op with a less-skilled friend, Beyond Gotham is a fine choice. If you want silly humor, there are better LEGO games to start with."

It was a good change leaving gotham which had already been the main focus of the last two installments, but it wasn't a batman game, which sempt really weird with it not only being named ""Lego Batman 3""  but being relased on his 75 Aniversary .The game was highly adicting  which is obvious seeing how i've been playing this game for the last week and am currently sittting at 98.5 percent, and you would think that I would have finished, but I haven't and probaby won't.Two days ago I atempted to complete all of the planets but the shape of the planets being round and to small to look flat made me sick and often the experince would be boderline nuziating. Odym was the worst as it was layered and there were difrent floating islands, most of the other planets followed a similar structure. all but OaOa!!!!!!! BlOODY OA (Rage Is CoMING!!!!)

While it lacks an open world to explore like the previous installment and the recent Marvel Superheroes game, it still delivers a satisying LEGO experience.  Gameplaywise, not much has changed.  The LEGO game format is in full use, but still manages to be fun enough to push you through the story.  You break bricks to build with bricks, and pummel enemies with your vast array of characters given in each level.  This game elaborates on the tool specific costumes from previous LEGO Batman games, adding more suits for Batman, Robin and other characters.  The story is pretty light, but is entertaining enough to keep you playing.  As LEGO games always are, the story is childish; there are many instances of cringe-worthy jokes being littered through each scene.  But, as LEGO stories go, it's good enough for an original tale.All in all, LEGO Batman 3 is a fun, family-friendly adventure taking you through the heart of the DC Universe.  So many amazing chracters are represnted, and their inclusions alone should warrant interest from any avid DC fan.7/10  Pros- Fun story, Consistent gameplay, Good value, Plenty of DC loveCons- Repetetive missions, Cringe-worthy comedy, Okay PC port"

They all have roughly similar gameplay dynamics - each figure has special attributes that you use to negotiate the level (use Superman's heat vision to melt ice, use the Joker's joy buzzer to jumpstart an electric turbine), then you come back through again with your choice of characters and you can do more things to unlock more characters and rewards.Much of the stuff added for Lego Marvel is here, just with giant ""DC COMICS!"" stickers slapped on them - instead of Deadpool Bricks, you collect Plastic Man Bricks, the ""Stan Lee In Peril"" puzzles now feature Adam West, and so on.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Of particular note is an entire level done in the style of the  '60s Batman TV show.  It's cute, and silly, and hits the sweet spot for those of us who have fond memories of Cesar Romero covering his mustache with greasepaint.This particular iteration of the series leans heavily on DC's contemporary Lantern mythos - there's not just a Green Lantern, no - all the colors of the rainbow have their own Lantern teams, and chaos ensues when bad ol' Braniac kidnaps all the Lantern leaders to do, you know, villain stuff.  Goodies and Baddies have to team up to stop Braniac from doing whatever, you know, just go hit stuff and solve puzzles and let the paper-thin plot do its own thing.Some of the puzzles are a little complicated, especially for the 6-10 crowd that these games seem to be aiming for, and the presence of filmmaker Kevin Smith and comedian Conan O'Brien in the game is downright weird, but at the end of the day, it's a Lego Superhero game.  Either you like these, or you don't.(One particularly nice thing - they licensed the iconic John Williams ""Superman Theme"" for the game.  That's a lovely piece of music, and I'm quite content to just soar around the world as Superman, letting it play in the background.)"

It doesn't take itself seriously, it doesn't try to contend itself with any game that carries a DC or Marvel label on it and (sounding like a massive, massive nerd) they're the only places where you're able to see an entire extended universe cast in one place and interacting with one another. The amount of comic book references in this game is astounding, with characters involved from the DC universe from ages back that the average gamer will have no clue (Composite Superman, I'm looking at you), and the situations you can create in terms of characters are hilarious. No-where else in gaming am I able to have an occassion where I can have a Red Lantern punch Captain Boomerang in the face, and that's just amusing in it's own right to love it :PThis game isn't something you take seriously. It's something you boot up, start playing and laugh at. And the game knows this and will laugh with you and how stupid it it. Then you go back and play a level again with different characters and unlock the rest of the fun stuff in the level. There's plenty in this game to keep people interested, just take it as it is.

Lego Batman was finally a shift to an original story, somewhat, based on the source material and then Lego Batman 2 had full blown dialog for each main character. It became much more funny and an interesting game to play since then. Lego Batman 3 continued that and its working fanstastic now that theyve increased the scope of these Lego games to be actual, games, instead of cheap nostalgic trips. I found the replayability parts of the Lego games to be fairly weak (aka going back to the story and gaining 100% stud pieces, etc) so I was happy to see they made multiple hub worlds with small extra bits of questing from various NPCs to be refreshing.Like any smart PC gamer I got this on a mega discount so I feel sorry for all shallow gamers that paid for the Season Pass early on.

I do have to warn you though, flying on the lantern planets + the moon can get really really headachey and you may get nauseous. I know flying around them for an extended period of time made me want to throw up. Doesn't mean I didn't like the game, but some missions on the lantern planets (like finding certain characters for a mission) took me an extensively long time because I had to stop so I wouldn't get too nauseous. Collecting everything was amazingly fun, and as always, LEGO put their own spin on lots of things. The voice acting was pretty good I'd say, and there's lots of characters that you can get that are super entertaining. I had my fun with flash considering how fast he is (really sped up free play, haha). Near the end, it took awhile to find some character missions in the Batcave and the JL base in order to get to 100%, but other than that, it was all good. I can't say I'm the most experienced LEGO games person out there, but I do have a few, and I've played a lot more on other platforms."

Free Play allows the player to use each unlocked (and purchased) character in the single/two player story levels without being constrained to the characters required for the mission.Purchase this and play to your heart's content!"

I had a blast working my way through a campaign built for the Justice League. It's for this purpose that I feel that the whole DC universe and Justice League campaign as well as the awesomeness of this title is not worthy of holding the title of Batman.It runs fluidly and features lots of DC lore and related content. You'll get to explore beautiful distant planets in a wonderfully realised legoized style. There's no substitute for this games beauty, character rich gameplay, and the DLC in this title is particuarly interesting. It uses the standard LEGO base with their unique additions, and it really is fun to play. There are also tease moments for known coming games including the Avengers and Jurrasic World.I generally avoid all DLC, but this title provides an exemption. Two DLC moments worth noting would be when you play through the Arrow and Dark Knight DLC. As Arrow, you make your way through a dessert island with a bow and arrow, with your mentor, and it's a wonderful rendition of the TV series which I'm familiar with. In the Dark Knight Trilogy DLC package, where I really wonder why the word trilogy appears there... You get to play as Heath Ledger dressed as the Joker in a nurses uniform with a rocket launcher. This moment alone is worth getting the parental title without question.All in all, this game is incredible, immersive, filled with personality and content. The developers have done an amazing job all around. My only gripe is that as it's labelled as ""Beyond Batman"", I was expecting them to build upon Batman 2 with the open world Gotham - but I suppose this component wasn't what I expected. This game is deserving of it's own unique franchise for the Justice League, but the open world in this title feels constrictive as you're isolated to the Batcave and the Watchtower (a spaceship). For this reason I like it less, but it's purely preference and it's logical, but it does feel like a step back from it's previous title.There's a bonus level too, in which you play as a 1966 batman, which pays an enormous respect to the original Batman, and the 1966 counterparts for superheroes and villans. Make sure you check it out, it's so much fun and to tributional.If you at all like comics, consider yourself a nerd, love the DC universe and lore, and perhaps even slighly enjoy lego as a product or digital entertainment medium, you really will love this game. Go and grab it already!"

The story is really good, even if it is a game for kids, the level design is really good and the soundtrack is great. The additional content is worth buying and fun to play. The controls can be tricky and there are some bugs, f. e. on hub planets, the speedsters cannot reach their full speed. Also some hub missions were frustating, especially the Qward one with the slaves and the Nok one with the bugs. But to conclude, this game is really awesome and I like to see LEGO Batman 4 or a LEGO DC Super Heroes to spice things up a little."

76561198044522566,Recommended,313690,28396400,"Posted: 15 December, 2016",all,KaizokuNinja,This was almost the perfect Super Hero game.  The cast is massive and the DLC list was impressive.  They did a lot right with this game.The story is actually really fun and in classic Lego style the humor is adorable.  The DLC stories were also engaging and overall the play experience provides a lot of replay value.  This is a great co-op game as well and a must for parents that want something to play with kids that doesn't require a complex game mechanic.They dropped the ball a little on the vehicles though.  There is only one area to use them and the map is quite small making most of the air vehicles pretty useless and not fun.  Water vehicles were dropped entirely.  The vehicle planet is very boring looking and makes driving just to drive less fun than the predecessor.The character cast is great.  As a huge DC fan I loved how many lesser known heroes they got into the mix and I love the little Easter Eggs where they sing theme songs and make comments to each other as you run around.  The cast is so big and the powers so numerous that you can get everything in the entire game without even using 80% of them and thats just fine.  The one thing I wish they had done is allowed for more random battles and heroic deeds even after everything is unlocked in the hubs.  It would have been nice to be able to still save people and have more battles even after they had been completed for objectives.This is a recommended buy for parents that like to play with their kids and for the young at heart gamer.  I paid full price on this and it was worth every penny.  If it is on sale it is a must have.

In this game you cant go to Gotham or Metropolis, but instead you go to lantern hub worlds. They seem cool but its hard to navigate with a speedster or a flying character. The roster is unbelievably great, the game play is smooth, and the story is funny even for adults or late teens. The DLC for this game is the best in any LEGO game. 10/10"
,Recommended,313690,31961971,Posted: 25 May,all,WizardJeremy,"Brilliant LEGO Game that showcases a ton of fun and cool heroes, villains, and characters from the DC Comics universe.With an original story containing all the major DC characters such as Batman, Superman, the Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, Wonder Woman, etc. and many many more. Traverse across space and other planets to play as these multitude of characters to defeat Brainiac who wants to... take over the world... (shocker).There are ton of wonderful characters to play as, pretty much all of the major characters in any DC comic and a ton of minor characters too. All have their own unique look and abilities which make them all fun to play as.Pros:- Great gameplay- Good graphics- Fun hub worlds- Very big variety of characters- Many fun levelsCons:- Gameplay can be repetitive (Is standard with LEGO Games)- Story is weak in most areas- No Gotham hub world sadly. They literally mean BEYOND gotham.My Rating: 8.5/10"

76561198044551402,Recommended,313690,32018257,Posted: 28 May,all,Koodlevoodlen,"My feels about this game shifted as I played it, but the TL;DR version of this review is that if you've played other open world LEGO games before and liked them, you'll likely feel the same about this one.The longer version is this.The campaign is fine. The story is no better or worse than the other LEGO games and the corny humor managed to draw a smile and even a handful of chuckles out of me even though I'm a young adult. I'm a huge superhero - and specifically a DC fan - so the settings, the lore, and the characters were fun for me to play around with.Speaking of characters, this game has all the ones you'd want in a DC game and then some. From the A list to the Z list, there are so many characters to play as. Ever hear of Polka Dot Man? I read the comics and even I hadn't heard of him before playing this. Yet he's in and playable.The open world was my first bit of disappointment. Gone are the days of a single space to run, fly, and drive around in to pick up quests, save citizens in peril, and unlock collectibles in. Now everything is spread out around a bunch of smaller spaces with their own flair to them. All 7 Lantern Corps home planets are their own hubs with the Batcave, Watchtower, Hall of Justice, and Legion of Doom headquarters making up the rest. It may sound good to have so much variety, but truthfully, it kind of has some drawbacks.There's this wormhole animation that plays when you travel between hubs where you can't really do much of anything for about 15 seconds. It may not sound that bad, but when you reach the point where you've had your fun and just want to finish the game, it just feels like dead air and wastes your time. 3 of the Lantern planets look fairly similar to one another to the point where it will take a little while to distinguish them from each other mentally.Next, the controls. Flight took some getting used to in previous LEGO games, but once you figured out how it worked, it was easy enough to complete races and get from point A to B. With this game, I struggled all the way to the last race. The spherical planet hubs are cool to look at in the beginning, but when you try to do the races, the camera will sometimes throw you off entirely which will screw up your flight path and you'll time out your race. I've had to put the game down and walk away for a few days due to getting too frustrated with the keyboard controls in races that required sharp turns. Some vehicles control better than some characters, so when they were available, I eventually found the right fit for what I need to do for the race.Otherwise, I feel I can recommend the game. A good time for the majority of it and some neat fanservice to people who like DC."

,Recommended,313690,28950805,Posted: 2 January,all,Kailen,"This might be my new favorite of the Lego games.  Star Wars III might still be a technically better game, thanks to those RTS-like zones, but this one had a lot of good things going for it.  And a lot of bad things, glitches etc., that particularly show up in the late game.  However, this one's got a new story, focusing more on Braniac and the various Lantern Corps, with a good bit of the classic Lego game humor, and a whole lot of homages.  And it's those homages that put this game over the edge for me.  Superman and Wonder Woman play their classic theme music when flying around, there's a secret level based on the 1966 Adam West show, complete with the sound effect cards when you hit things, and the usual assortment of DC characters ranging from classics to obscure.  All in all, a very fun game, one that I'm actually pondering picking up the DLC for.  It has provided enough hours of entertainment to justify it, and hey, more fun could be had that way."
76561198121092239,Recommended,313690,28824635,"Posted: 30 December, 2016",all,cf.barbossa,"If you know any of the previous LEGO games, you know exactly what to expect.Graphics and sound deliver what they are expected to- surroundings and characters look fine and the music includes licensed tunes from official TV- and movie soundtracks. Nice, but nothing raelly outstanding.The reason to play LEGO games is the gameplay and that is so addicting that you just keep coming for more. So I was really happy to see that the levels felt longer and overall better designed in this game than its predecessor.The downside is well known: hardly anyone seems to like the multiple hub worlds. I don't see the 7 lantern planets as actual level hubs, as neither of them actually connects to any level or, any other world than the moonbase (which in turn becomes a hub for the planets). Actually, there are only two real hubs: the space station and the moonbase, with no less than 9 additional areas to explore. Sounds great, but becomes tedious as none of these areas are interconnected. All in all, a big step down from LEGO DC Superheroes and LEGO Lord of the Rings with their enormous overworlds.On the other hand, the side quests are fun and sometimes form small story-arcs (or rather, arcletts) wich can be quite funny. The variety of the quests is great and I could have done with quite a few more.All in all, a solid instalment of the LEGO series that offers more of the same- not yet stale, but lacking fresh ideas."
