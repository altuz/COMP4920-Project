The riveting story is supported by emotionally engaging characters such as rising Judo star Gushiken Takahiro, our main protagonist, on a quest to bring honor to Japan by winning an upcoming Judo competition (as Judo is the most popular sport known to man, so winning this competition would prove Japan victors of the world). His friends and family, having no faith in the spirit of Japan himself, mostly because the main character is a giant nerd, tell him he should pray at a magical temple to give him good luck.With directions given to him by a female Judo teacher he watches bathe because he's an unlikable pervert (this is okay, because this perversion gives the charactermore depththe only depth he gets in the entire game), he walks into a mystical forest, only to find an abandoned, but well kept traditional Japanese shrine. Walking inside, he begins to pray, but not after long, he hears a woman talking in his ear. He gets dizzy and falls to the floor, but not before getting a glimpse of this figure, who appears to be a succubus! All of a sudden, it's clear! The Americans tricked him into going to this shrine to sacrifice himself to Satan unwillingly! It was all a clever ploy to get Japan out of the running for the Judo competition!I wont ruin the rest of the story, but the essentials are that he meets some fair maidens who are total♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but then he meets some that are like, fox girls, or something. And the fox girl in blue is my waifu, so I'm just gonna put it out there, she's off-limits.This VN has a lot of references to Western pop culture and old Japanese mythos, while retaining a feeling of being true and unique to a real life situation. It makes the player feel as if they are actually a Judo star from Japan stuck in a world full of chicks with huge boobs and almost no men to stop you from hittin' that. Because if there were, you'd probably be too beta and ugly to get some.This is theBoku no PicoEvangelion of visual novels.10/10, it was kinda garbage, but I got a new waifu, so I'm definitely not regreting the $7.49 I paid for this."

There is *spoilers* only 1 choice to be made, and the story doesn't branch too differently whether you choose one or the other.The art is pretty good, but the story is super standard, there is no meaningul drama and characters aren't very fleshed out, it's also not the best writing out there, without taking into account the typos here and there. Pretty much like many Type B anime series out there at the moment. But if that is your thing however, then this is for you. The novel is pretty short and all of the 'content' worth paying for is already leaked out in the Community Hub for this game, so take a look at that before wasting money on this.To be honest there are much better visual novels on Steam already. Like Narcissu, and that one is free. Go ahead and play that.That said, support all kinds of Visual Novels on Steam, for great justice."

The situations are very funny and sometimes so absurd that you can't not laugh. But and that is the point you have to know, its like you read a book or a manga or something else. A visual novel isn't a ""real"" game where you can interact with your environment. You get some beautiful wallpapers from those girls that show you the current situation. But that's all. You have only one decision in the whole game and the story ends always equal! So ionlyrecommend it if you like to read, are interested in an unusual funny story and see some great wallpapers with some ecchi.Otherwisei can't recommend this visual novel for you.Is it porn?No, it isn't porn (or hentai), but and that is fact, it includes some nudity and some sexual allusions but you'll get to see anything. There is always something in the way, so it's skillfully censored, which is completely normal for this type of representation (called Ecchi).Don't buythe game, if you only want to see boobs!To bring bring it to the point:funnyvisual novel with sexy girls. 6/10In summary:ProContra+ funny story- only one selectable decision+ absurd situations- maybe a bit short+ nice wallpapers- no voice acting+ sexy girls- price is a bit to highPS: I just wanted to write a short review, which brings the essence of the game to the point.

This would be forgiveable if the CG involved some actual nudity; but there is no REAL nudity whatsoever, it's all implied.  Ditto for the complete lack of sex or the like.The game struggles at basic romance, and the plot doesn't even give you a conclusion to the relationships it tries to show you.So:Effectively no interactivity;No real nudity;No sex or physical intimacy;No conclusion to the plot;And the plot itself is incredibly thin / brief.The characters are well drawn and while they're pretty stereotypical they're appealing fun enough for there to have been a shot at a good visual novel here; but unfortunately that opportunity is wasted by a terrible lack of content.Not worth buying - just watch a vid of a playthrough on YouTube or check out the CGs, there's really nothing more to this game."

But I do not recommend this visual novel reason can be found below.The StoryTake on the role of a Rising Judo Star Gushiken Takahiro was two weeks away from the match that would make or break his career -- a championship match where the winner is then signed up to be a young national athlete for Japan.He's prepared and ready, but that doesn’t stop him from being nervous about his upcoming battle. At the suggestion of his friends and classmates, he goes to a shrine that is rumoured to grant any wish or prayer. He pours all the coins from his already full coin bank into the offering box and says his prayer. After praying, he becomes dizzy and nauseous and eventually faints. When he wakes up, he finds himself in an ancient, unfamiliar place.While searching for a way back to his village, he stumbles upon two girl wielding swords chasing after two… foxgirls.Music and ArtstyleMusic feels average at best nothing too fancy here, But for the artstlye it is honestly very good as much I hate to say this I enjoyed the overall artstyle of this Visual Novel the CG scenes are good making good use of smooth colors.Reasons for not recommending this Visual NovelThe story is very generic, when I first read this visual novel I felt bored very bored because its generic and predictable. Some guy got tranported into another world and then gets into some nice situation where everytime he opens a door there will be a half naked girl in it and then he needs to find a way back to his original home and a great miracle happend he got sent back. (sounds familiar? Probably yes because this type of storyline can be found in everywhere)The artstyle of the sprites for certain chracther I think the chracther name was slime (I think) those 4 chracthers were so lazily made all of them have the same chracther model and the only difference is the eye colour, and the colour of the slime covering their body, other than that all is good.The fansercvice, while playing through this visual novel you are literally being slapped in the face with boobs every 15 minutes, this just shows that they are using fanservice to cover up their bad and generic story.To sum upNo i do not recommend getting this game at all unless you are a sakura series fan or just want a story that slaps you in the face with boobs every 10 minutes in a attempt to cover up their bad plot/story."

A rising star in the field, he gains some level of fame and earns a scholarship to the school he wants. Everything he came back for, right? It'd be totally stupid if he were to, say, immediately throw away everything he came back for and go to the shrine and yell for two months, trying to go back to the other world.Oh waaaaaait.Why the ♥♥♥♥ did you even go back if you were going to invalidate the only reason you had to go back, Takahiro? You showed up, did the thing, and your yell of THE TOURNAMENT immediately turns to GOTTA RETURN TO THE PAST-FUTURE!!The rest of this game was some seriously amateur nonsense.

Patch it and give it some more game elements. Good luck Devs.I bought it with steam funds I made from playing counter-strike. I don't think you should spend 7.50 USD on it. If it gets down to 2 USD or less you can think about it."

I will attempt to be as unbiased when writing this review. I will warn those of you that are reading this that there might be some spoilers, but seeing how I finished this game in about 2 hours-ish while trying to figure out how some of the characters sounded like when they were speaking, I don't think you'll mind as much. If you speed read I think you might be able to finish this in maybe 20 Minutes - 50 Minutes, depending on how fast you can actually read. I visited their website and it says that it is their first Original English Language Visual Novel that wil be published on Steam. I assume this just means that it is the first OELVN to make it onto Steam. Now onto the review.Peronsally, I felt that this game could've been more...There is a lot of potential in this game, especially in games where it should focus mainly on the story, while giving players a choice to choose where the story goes. A visual novel by any other name.But this was more of a... digital book, instead of a VN. It gave you only a single choice for the duration of the entire game, which honestly disappointed me. Not only because I only had one choice through the entirety of the game, but it had such little impact on the story that the second time I went through it to choose the other option the only thing that changed was who you went with to the festival. Everything else remained the same.The story was somewhat generic, but I love stories.However, this story seemed to go at too fast a pace. Things were happening much too quickly and the story advanced way too fast. Situations changed from confused and nervous, to happy and perverted, to sad and somber, and then to happy and perverted again faster than flipping a coin and watching it fall on the table.In no time at all you've already, somehow, made it through several days, and then somehow you made it through an entire week! Then suddenly you are shoved through a portal that takes you back into the world where Takahiro was originally from. No explanation as to how that portal appeared, but it did. You got shoved through it. Good job.I'm not saying that there wasn't a lot of scenarios, because there were a fair amount of scenarios. They just felt rushed in hindsight. They came in much too abruptly, and ended far too quickly, and then another scenario comes in just as abruptly as the last one did. There is no breather, no build-up, it's just one thing after another. There could have been more pauses to lengthen the story, some dry spots where the characters could get to know each other better. But they all seemed to get along pretty well in some very perverted situations.But then the characters! The characters!One of the key items to any good story is the characters! But they just don't have any... definition. Nothing to define them, nothing to make them stand out, make them more unique. They're just sort of there, with a REALLY quick and sad backstory. But even then most of the characters don't have backgrounds and the game conveniently states that they all don't remember their past. Just... kind of sounds lazy to me... I'm being honest. There's little heart-warming bonding moments between the characters. They just... kind of splash water on each other and show each other their semi-naked bodies. That's all I remember from those ""Bonding"" moments.The artwork is very nice! Pretty much all I have to say on the artwork.There were also some spelling and grammatical errors and typos.So to reiterate,-Generic story, but I like any kind of story that can take my attention.-Scenes go by really fast.-Characters are there, but they lack definition.-Really short game. I got through it in about 2 and a half hours.-Lack of choices for a VN, therefore a lack of results and consequences.-More of a digital book with pretty pictures.At the end it said something about a ""prologue"". I hope that they will add in new chapters for free and not make us pay for it seperately. In the end I would say the $7.49 I spent on it was worth the pictures. I know how painful it can be to draw pictures like that. Even if you know what you are doing, drawing things like those in the game is a time consuming activity. I would not say that it is worth $9.99 however.That is my review thank you for reading this lengthy thing, but I felt that it had to be done.I give Sakura Spirit a 6.5/10 simply for the drawings."

,Not Recommended,313740,11181411,"Posted: 11 July, 2014",all,The_Idiot,"This is a poor example of the Visual Novel genre, which is unfortunate because the story has so much potential. The story seems to revolve around the fanservice, rather than the other way around. Where some fanservice is expected from this type of game, the story goes out of its own way to work fanservice into practically every scene. If that were the worst of the story's problems, it could perhaps be forgiveable, but there are several additional problems that turn this story from so-so to bad.There are consistency problems within the story. At one point, I thought the program had bugged and skipped me through a part of the story, due to failure on the story's part to remain consistent within itself. There are several ways this could have been done better, but the story as it is leaves you going ""Now wait a minute, I thought..."" every so often.The story does not branch. This is perhaps the most egregrious problem with the story as it stands. The visual novel presents you with exactly one choice throughout the story. In addition, the choice has no bearing on anything, only giving you the option of seeing one of two events before the two paths merge once again. There is one ending and no branching story, and you're basically taken on a ride on rails.I will withhold judgement on the numerous grammatical errors for now, as there is supposedly a patch forthcoming to address this specifically.This story had huge amounts of potential. Unfortunately, it seems that potential will go unrealized; this visual novel has been released as a finished game instead of as an early access, indicating the developers have no desire to flesh the story out further and improve the quality of this game.I will give this visual novel credit; it has beautifully drawn pictures and good ambient music. With a good story behind it, this game could have been favorably compared to other visual novels such as Katawa Shoujo, and the story does have the potential to compare to Katawa Shoujo... with a lot of work. Without a good story behind it, though, the pictures and music can't carry the visual novel alone. As it stands, the visual novel is like a Cadillac with a go-cart engine; beautiful on the outside, but nothing worth mentioning under the hood.Graphics: 4/5Sound: 4/5Story: 2/5Interactivity: 0/5Overall: 2/5"

This review may also spoil the game, so you have been warned.Pros:-Funny, interesting, and cute characters throughout the game.-Wacky, funny, and flat-out insane scenarios the main character ends up in, as fitting for the Sakura franchise.-Tells a complete story, and said story has a very happy ending. (personally, that's the best part) :steamhappy:Cons:-Story is waaaayyyyy too short. I prefer lengthier ""games"" like this. Perfect examples are GBDNATE and Max's Big Bust.-There is no nudity, in spite of the game's page saying there is. And even with the ""nude"" scenes, the girls are covered up in one way or another.-Only one choice in the entire game. And it doesn't even matter because it's just 2 pathways to take to reach the same ending.-Seemingly promises some sexual content, but all we get is just some what appears to be half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥innuendos and♥♥♥♥♥♥blockings.These are the simple pros and cons of the game that I have noticed. I know there's more that people would put into the list, but I'm just making a general overview. Personally, I would have liked to see several choices that lead to several outcomes. Like, what if Takahiro never did go to the shrine? What if he decided NOT to escape with Maeko and Machiko? What if he decided NOT to attend the festival? What if Tsuyuki had never interfered in the first place? Alot of questions like these would have to be answered by the devs themselves. But, i'm getting off topic.For my opinion of the game, i've got a mixed review. For the Sakura franchise, it's a decent filler if you're waiting for different things. If you don't care about how long it takes to get through, (or just want to see boobs) then I would say get this game. However, in the broad scheme of things, it's not as good as some ""games"" like GBDNATE and Max's Big Bust, which have a wide cast of funny, unique characters that go through wacky scenarios and have very decent quality behind them. The dev of those 2 told me himself that he aims for those things: a quality game/visual novel/whatever you wanna call it, with quality, and a cast of funny, unique characters. I'm not saying Sakura Spirit was BAD persay. I'm just saying it was short and could have been better executed. Overall, it's not something I would recommend for fans of this franchise.Sorry if i♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥anyone off, but i'm giving an honest review, trying to keep my views as unbiased as possible.Until next time."

It's usually pretty clean down there. This game is full of♥♥♥♥♥♥ asses, upskirts, downblouses, legs, thighs, and lots of wet skin. Also fur, ears, and tails. Some people are into that sort of thing.Posing as a crude visual novel, Sakura Spirit is really just a softcore hentai manga. And super softcore at that. You'll see plenty of cleavage and skin, but never a nipple. There's definitely a lot of suggestive dialogue, but never any actual sexing. It's like watching a porno purely for the cheesy opening dialogue, but right as the clothes start coming off you shut your computer off.It takes a very special kind of person to enjoy the opening dialogue of a super cheesy porn. Most of the time, people will just skip right past it. And Sakura Spirit is no different. If you can't sit through and watch as these two people that clearly are going to bang talk in a clearly scripted and poorly acted out manner, you won't be able to stand a second of this game.The dialogue is dry in that same sense. There's little substance to it. It's a light-hearted story, and the writing is sometimes humorous. But to call it witty, or clever, or really well-written is kinda pushing it. There's even some basic spelling mistakes and typos in the game, and it wasn't even developed in Japan. It'll be mildly self-aware at times, but never really enough. There's a few parts where it'll try and get you to take it seriously, as the story's main plot points come and go. There's a lore to the game. A mythos. A very well-endowed mythos.A young boy, self-proclaimed judo star, has been transported to feudal Japan. And that's where all these♥♥♥♥♥♥are, apparently. Yes, as many have you must have learned in history class, feudal Japan is famous for its many furry, voluptuous girls. Japanese people are actually born with animal ears and a tail, but they're surgically removed at birth to keep white people from beating off in their ears. Getting ♥♥♥♥ in your ears is kinda nasty. Especially if they're all furry, and the♥♥♥♥♥is all sticky and gunks up your hair.From there, you learn the troubled past of feudal Japan.

That wouldn't make your parents disown you most of the time. It just kinda makes things awkward at dinner, especially after you just had the talk about why haven't you moved out yet and how a thirty year old man should have his own place.The art is pretty nice at the very least. Someone could definitely spill some baby oil over this game. It is pretty generic as far as anime-style goes. All of the characters pretty much have the same face and body, just with swapped out hair and a different eye color. But that's all it takes for some people.For some people, this is the best thing to happen since someone decided that anthropomorphic animals make perfect children's cartoon characters. They don't have to clear their internet history, and they don't need to worry about getting a virus on a shady website. They just go offline, fire this game up, and transport themselves to a far away land where they can use an animal's ears as ♥♥♥♥ handles without getting arrested.If you're that type of person, how could I steer you away from your perfect game?

Essentially, this VN is a book that has one ""Chose Your Own Adventure"" decision and ultimately changes nothing.Finally, the game is extremely short. I finished the game in approximately 90 minutes and even though I have fast reading speeds, it's ridiculous how short the game is. The choices change around eight minutes of dialogue for each.Overall...The game is essentially a fan-servicey fan-fiction with stylish art that has mediocre writing, characters anda lack of originality. I don't recommend this game for a person that's looking for a good story."

76561198112059304,Not Recommended,313740,12264165,"Posted: 27 September, 2014",all,Pannacone,"I came into Sakura Spirit expecting it to be a shallow dating sim game with attractive, overly busty girls. As part of the visual novel genre, I also expected it to have long stretches of text between gameplay decisions. However, Sakura Spirit falls far under my already low expectations for it: there is very little diversity between the female cast of characters and there isn't much gameplay to be found at all—in fact, there is only one choice to make in the whole entire thing. Sakura Spirit, unfortunately, isn't much of a game at all.Had Sakura Spirit's plot been less generic, I may have forgiven it its incredibly limited player choices. However, the storyline of Sakura Spirit (a high school judo star that goes to make a wish at a secret shrine in the forest before the biggest competition of his life and is then sucked into an alternate reality where spirits exist) is somewhat overdone and rather boring. I found myself reading through an hour's worth of content and then pressing the skip button to see when I would eventually come to some sort of choice in the narrative, while also enjoying the various pictures of attractive characters in promiscuous positions.The main character is as underdeveloped as the plot. He is both noble and easily flustered, two traits which should be endearing but are actually sources of irritation in a beta character that has absolutely no game at all when it comes to the ways of women. All of the girls are equally irritating: some will clearly try to seduce the main character and then back off at the last second while others will be innocently talking to the main character and then climb onto his lap—all of which would be perfectly acceptable if these advances ever led to any development in the relationships between characters. Instead these isolated incidents only serve to end in a main character who almost seems to be eternally friendzoned. Altogether, the characters of Sakura Spirit are lacking any compelling qualitiesSakura Spirit does have a couple of redeeming qualities. Some of the humor found in Sakura Spirit can be amusing, at first. The game relies heavily on pop culture references, lowbrow humor, and the overuse of common character tropes, all of which earns minor chuckles at the beginning of the game, but grows somewhat tedious later on. Nevertheless, Sakura Spirit does have the occasional redeeming moment. Unfortunately, those moments aren't frequent enough to earn it my recommendation."

Despite what others say there is more to it than just spending your time looking at scantily clad women etc. it does have a story for you to follow and it ends on a cliff hanger so I hope there is a follow on. While sakura games are known for the ""more revealing"" women and sexual nature; for me it never takes anything away from the story; I enjoyed the story and when the pictures came I enjoyed them too.sure a lot of people give negative views because of the pictures and they may not be to everybodies tastes but at the end of the day if you buy a game blind than that is on you, any sort of tiny amount of research into Sakura games would show what you were in store for; so the people complaining about it you only have yourself to blame.to get more on to a review topic the story is enjoyable as I said and while not everyone agrees with the pictures they can add to the characters/story, quite a few are from ""misunderstandings"" as they're spirits and want to be liked and are going by heresay on what a human man likes from a woman, as with other Sakura games I have played the main character you play isn't a perv or anything, situations just keep happening and he tries to be respectful and gentlemnly and often acts just as shocked and embarrased as the person and looks away.Even at full price which I paid; this game it still cheaper than going to see a film at the cinema and lasts longer (for me anyway) and provided me with just as much enjoyment if not more depending on the film at the cinema, so in my opinion is it worth the money, yes for sure and I plan to get other Sakura products in the future."

It isn't interactive enough to be considered a dating sim (literally one decision, and playing that one branch is maybe 20 minutes), it isn't complete enough to be called an interactive book. It doesn't commit to the cheesecake (and beyond) enough for the pervs.  It's not funny enough tie all these shortcomings into something more.  Oh yah, and it's incredibly short, even for the genre.  3 hours in and I finished both paths, looked through teh gallery, and then finally quit.It reminds me of a low-rent Tenchi Muyo.  Which is too bad, because I like Tenchi.Don't let some of the reviews fool you, this doesn't go much further art-wise than the preview.  Literally every single piece of art in the game can be found by the front page of Google Image Search, without even clicking through.Redeeming factors:What art is there is quite good in the genre of anime cheesecake. Unrealistic, idealized, likely not matching what bones actually do, but definitely fun to look at. (if you do end up getting it, make sure to look at the gallery after beating it.  There are some entertaining outtake pictures, which you won't see in-game)If this really is a prologue as suggested by the ending, then maybe there's more in this world that will be more fun.Ultimately, there are better dating sims if you want that, there are better interactive novels, and there's more committed cheesecake.

Buying it full price is a no-no, and any discount less than that goes with a huge ""Maybe."" I put the rating at Not Recommended because of how most of the time you wouldn't be getting your money's worth with this game, but my opinion is a bit more complicated.Now, when you're talking about a Visual Novel, the first thing that comes to mind would be either the story or the porn. I'll just put it out here that it doesn't have any of the two. It got a story with an okay-ish foundation but horrible execution and it doesn't have porn, just almost-naked girls. You'll have a better time watching the seasonal anime than this if you want fan service.The story is... it got some good touch, but it's ruined by lack of elaboration. Everything just happen at the speed of bullet-train and the length is as short as your disappointed b_ner. It's got what I'd call the Ground Zeroes problem, selling what is almost a demo at full price. Two dollars is a fair price for the length (just as long as Ground Zeroes' main campaign if you fast read it), which felt like maybe a quarter to half of the common route in standard VNs, but it's still lacking in many areas:The interaction with the village, for example, would be interesting but is glossed over, the story jumps all over the place, and the worst thing is, there is only one point of choice and there is no multiple ending at all. Sometimes it got the mood right, but then comes the fan service which really disturbs the atmosphere of the story. The jokes are enough to make you grin and say ""Heh,"" but not enough to cause a real chuckle, and that's if you're okay with standard harem anime stuffs. The ending does not resolve anything either. The writing itself is fanfiction-tier, the mediocre ones. But again, the length is the worst part. If it wants to be taken seriously, then it needs to double the length of the original story's by adding more events, then add some extras to the post-tournament stuffs, before heading to real routes. Yes, it has NO ROUTES. By the gods.Characterization for the girls are two-dimensional. One ""default"" dimension (their stereotype) and one ""we actually have a hidden depth"" dimension. As the dimension's naming suggested, it felt like it was there only so that they could claim that the girls are not one-dimensional. Problem is, the story touches the problem but then goes ""Nah! Fooled you,"" and not elaborate at all. The biggest offender would be Narumi and Machiko.Narumi has a history with Machiko which might be instrumental to understanding the current situation with the spirits, but it's never explored and is abandoned except for the reasoning for some hijinks, despite how Machiko seems to had a sealed/repressed memories of it.Honestly, Narumi is so Mini-Machiko (Machiko with less traits on her) that she might as well just not be there and pass her role to Miyo, who is only made of tsundere+duty like a Mini-Aisha (Koihime Musou).The writing/language also attempts to be a ""Fan Translation""-esque in its style, addled with Japanese honorifics, which doesn't have Fan Translation's handicap of being originally made by Japanese who understands its usage. The most particularly jarring one would be how it used ""Elder-sama"" like they couldn't make up their mind whether to use English or Japanese for it. There is also a high usage of -chan honorifics, and the weirdly absent usage of -dono despite it being the right period of time.Now, on its arts, it's actually pretty good IF it had more variety in it. There is a distinct feels of being western-made with it, but otherwise it passes. The background isn't bad but it's ladden with straight lines and repititive backgrounds. The CG is... good enough to be mildly stimulating, but lacking in originality and creativity. The best part would probably be the shading, but that's like having a good roof but a cheap foundation - one good advanced aspect while the basics aren't well-implemented. If the length were any longer, than it would have overstayed whatever welcome it had, but otherwise it was good enough for one not to mind it too much at least.The music has only one track that is good... but that's one out of like five or three tracks they had. They could really have just gotten some free-licenses musics as some filler, I believe some ONScripter games had free-licenses music though I will admit I don't know much about it.Now, about the only reason you'd want this game is because it's a western-made VN with easy accessibility on Steam and arts that looked good. About the only reason I could give to recommend this game would be to encourage the developers, but that's only one point out of dozens of points against it. So I will have to settle this lengthy review with a rating of:3 out of 10 - Not really good, hardly recommendable under most circumstances."

I'd rate it high for artwork, but low for choice making. so call it a qualified recommendation, for the reasons stated below:There is only one choice for the reader to make in the whole reading, and it doesn't really affect the outcome.That said, I thought the artwork was quite good, and the story was decent enough, but I would not buy this if you are looking for a game with choices to make. (Heroes Rise: The Prodigy, and Heroes Rise: The Hero project are much better for choice making, but lack artwork).The story seemed to be the prologue of a much longer story though, given the end credits end with a teaser.  Perhaps I'll give the story another chance if they come out with a ""Sequel"", but again, it's the anime style artwork that was the draw for me.If you do decide to get this visual novel, be sure to wait for it to be on sale. I usually rate my games on how much I have to spend in terms of dollars per hour. This novel lasted about an hour and then some, so it doesn't rate high in that respect.If you don't mind spending the time to read a light short story, and enjoy ecchi anime art, then it's not so bad. But again, I'd wait for the novel to go on sale."

I've seen more skin at a regular beach. Breasts without nipples does not count as nudity. Honestly, I think the flesh-colored balloons were the only ""nudity"" in the whole thing. Sure, there is plenty of fan service all over the place, but if you really want to see naked anime girls and whatnot, go find some hentai or something. If you want nudity in general, there are TONS of PG-13 and R rated films out there offering way more.3) Mature? Only if your children have been closeted. From what I've seen in the reviews and guides, it looks like it's actually the immature that get their jollies on this one.4) The warning includes ""explicit sexual dialog."" I would say that everything ""sexual"" in this story was rather weak.As it was progressing, I was actually hoping it would morph into a dating sim and that I would get to see the ""losers"" catfight each other, and that other complications and choices would arise. Alas, it was a letdown on that part. So, that ""Dating Sim"" tag really needs to go.Luckily, I got this on sale. There's no way I would pay $10 for a rather generic combination of themes and story.

I spent 2 sessions of reading this digital, visual novel and I must say it is great. The story itself is fairly average, nothing is too extreme and you are always entertained by the dialogue which despite a few spelling and grammar mistakes here and then is still easily comprehensible.Sakura Spirit is about a teenage boy who lives in Japan and pretty much practices Judo every day and is competing in a Judo tournament that is to happen in 2 weeks time. However after visiting a shrine that is rumoured to grant any wish/prayer he finds himself in another realm were he runs into 2 feline guards chasing after 2 fox spirits. The 2 guards protect a small town within the middle of the forest that has a bad relationship with the forest spirits, the boy finds himself helping both the town and the 2 fox spirits to get along.As a visual novel it met my expectations, the story, dialogue, characters and pace was all very good. I never felt like the story was rushed and you could easily save your game at any point in the story and return to it at any time if you ever need to take a break. You were constantly entertained by the ""teasing"" fox spirits and guards but push aside the teasing there is a pretty solid base on a story which with the cliff-hanging ending it had deserves a sequel. It is even said at the end of the game that this is a prequel.Overall, it is a fantastic indie and it has led me to look into purchasing of some the other titles that these developers have released but have yet to play at the time of typing this.

This also appears to be the oldest in the Sakura series, and ends with a message that this is the prologue to further adventures. However, right before that message was one stating that this hero's story was also finished.Considering one never finds out which of the four maidens he chooses in the end, it ends a bit too early. And yes, this means there are not separate routes for each of the four girls. (While either of the foxwives would be interesting, and the fun-loving naginata wielder is cute, I figure he ends up with the katana wielding ""Tsundere Tyrant"". If only because her name ends up on the village which appears to become his home city. So yes, there is even an implication that he got sent to the past.)For a test of their games, this was fine. And as such, I will recommend it. However, I am unsure if the term ""dating sim"" actually fits this.

I seriously doubt you are going to find what you are looking for.  If you are interested in more than that, here is the review.Sakura Spirit is a Japanese visual novel featuring many ladies and a male protagonist.  The plot is paper thin.  The interaction is minimal, featuring few choices of what story path to take.  The visuals are...  well...  the visuals are of scantly clad women.  The ambient music varies from generic Asian to generic pornoesque, depending on the scene.  No voice overs, only text.The entire experience for me was about two hours on my first run.  There is some replay value if you desire to unlock all of the different gallery pictures, and read all of the different ways the story plays out.  Overall, it was pleasant, but very mediocre at best.  If you are a big fan of anime, and you really love the 'one dude, many women' genre, give it a shot.  For everybody else, I simply wouldn't bother."

To be perfectly honest, I got this game for the boobs, and in this aspect, it did not disappoint.Yes, I'm perfectly secure about my sexuality and did not start giggling like a teenage ret*rd when I was presented with anime breasts. And this seams to be the main problem when I see the reviews complaining about this ""game"" (but this is another debate, since I don't really consider VNs games but rather an own form of media). Since when does the fact of something showing skin make anything bad? By that standart, I can see a lot of people justifying r*pe because the victim wasn't dressedproperlyand other poor excuses.Quite honestly, I really liked the drawings made for it. I found them rather tasteful and sexy, and I'd say for 5 bucks they were totally worth the money. But from the technical aspect of a VN, Sakura Spirits is more disapointing thanbad.The story actually is okay, it is just unfinished. The writer really took a liking to the characters and made up some scenes meant to show off each one of them (personality-wise as physically) in a rather clichéed way, but that's what you actually expect, so there's nothing wrong from that point of view. The main character too, is actually rather sympathetic.But here already come the problems: in a VN, or you give every character, as minor as they are, a portrait to go along with, or you give them solely to the main cast. But here it seems like the devs couldn't decide what to do and gave them to the main cast and three random people you meet at the beginning of the novel who are never to be seen again, although they seemed rather like key figures for later on. I suppose that proves Winged Cloud's decision to give every character a portrait. I don't know exactly what they did, but it felt unnatural. Maybe it was the fact that we never saw the initial three people again.And this fact actually clashes with the notion of poor writing, in a sense of it becoming very noticeable towards the end that the writer really didn't know where to go with all he had made up until now and dumped everything in a cliff-hanger, in the hopes they could fix everything in a sequel.By the way, Sakura Angels and the anounced Sakura Fantasy have nothing to do with Sakura Spirits, story-wise. Yepp.Let that sink in: you are presented to a world and characterswhich don't carry any importance whatsoever. And that is the real problem here, if you bother to show something in a good story, it's because it is some integral part of the whole thing. Even if you show something to flesh out the world the story plays in, it is still good enough if it at least serves that purpose to the reader, but here it felt like a mess. And it really just feels that way because of how abrupt it ends.That is not to say the VN is not enjoyable. It actually is, trust me! If you like to read, and anime, it might be worth checking out, even if you just enjoy looking at anime chicks. The art is excellent! But Sakura Spirits just isn't the full package. The impression it gives off is that the devs had something really promising at hand, but decided to rush the product out as fast as possible when they were only midway through the story because they were getting short of money. Which, by now, they should have made enough of it to fix this problem giving Spirits a decent closure with a proper sequel.Sakura Spirit is a promising VN that leaves you hanging and angry if you enjoy a good plot with closure. Don't buy it if you want it for the story. But if you are satisfied with a superficial character study and good drawings, you might get your kicks out of this VN."

I thought it looked nice, so I bought it. Big mistake. While the art for character sprites and event CG's is well done, and it has nice backgrounds, that's about as far as it goes visually since everything else looks like they barely tried and looks bland. Although even then the art has impossible breast-physics and the girls all look fundamentally the same just with different hair, eye colours, and clothes.The 'story' and characters were...Well, about ten to twenty minutes into playing, I decided I was thoroughly bored and uncaptivated by the story or the characters and skipped the rest of it just to see the CG art. There was nothing really likeable about anyone besides that they were vaguely cute, and other than that were a cliche mess.There was also a lot of historical incontinuity and other mistakes with the labels of weapons and such.There is a single choice in the whole game that affects nothing besides giving you some more CG's of pretty much just the girls breasts and nothing more.The music wasn't anything special, although I got so sick of one track -I'm not even sure which one it was now- that I ended up muting the game. The rest was just plain unremarkable.I feel wholly unsatisfied and disappointed that I've played visual novels in languages I can barely understand and be far more captivated and intrigued than this one that's written in my native language. For me personally, nothing salvages this 'game', not even the cute artwork."

Very good, the storyline was good and text was easy to read/follow along. This my third VN I have gone through, the other two being Hate Plus and Analogue: A Hate Story. Be prepared to have a box or two of tissue handy for those emtional moments, like other reviewers have suggested. ☺I think whilst I was playing this, I had a friend de-friend me *silently* on steam, presumably because I was on this, but who cares - play what you want/like, this is free country and community(well free enough to allow this kind of stuff on here...)! Also had to explain to my sister, who happened to walk passed my room whilst playing this, why I was playing this. Yeah make sure to close and or lock(if you have a lock, I don't so I have to look behind once in a while) your bedroom doors, tip from me.Hm, let me see, any negatives? - Oh yes, there were a few or so typos and grammatical errors that hopfully the devs will patch. Also if you got friends who will judge you, play while having friendslist in offline or just play offline so steam doesn't even record your hrs played(probably better). Actually even better, just find a DRM free version(or an alternative make another steam account and buy this game on that and have no one in friendslist or at least no one who is judgemental) of this somewhere and that way you don't have this game linked to your account and can play at your heats content without judgment(Just make sure to do it in your own time if you live with people that are judgemental)! For me, I don't care if they do - I'm sure everyone plays at least this kind of game once in a while, hidden from prying eyes but they don't admit it.So yeah, if you like ecchi/furry and like to read(or have time to read) alot of stuff, this is for you, if not go somewhere else.I'm expecting a sequel for this art, and hopefully roll over the saves from this.And that's about it I think.

But, overall it was a bit of a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting some story-rich plot anything spectacular. I can appreciate fluff for what it is. I enjoy guilty pleasure gaming from time to time just for the sheer entertainment value. But, this game was just too lacking in nearly every way for me.The art is well drawn, and the characters are beautiful--but doesn't have much in terms of actual character design. Most characters have one, or maybe two expressions. If you look at each character side by side, there is barely no distinguishing them aside from the color of the hair and clothes. I know the game celebrates big breasts and shiny butts, and there's nothing wrong with that--but if you're going to make it the focus of your game, why not add a little variety to the body types and facial features?You can tell there is decent production value, but I really wish they would have used it to the fullest extent. Voice acting would have been a great touch, and might have added a little depth to the characters. More music would have been great too, especially without voices, but there seems to only be two or so songs. Choices would have also been worthwhile, so be warned if you enjoy your visual novels with lots of options and different routes or endings. This game has none, which is a shame considering the whole ""harem"" style of it. There is a single choice given in the entirety of the game, near the end...and no, it doesn't really have an effect on the plot at all. This is more of a kinetic novel, which is simply a story played out for you with little or no interaction on your part. Which would have been fine, if only the story were better."

A game requires some level of decision making to it throughout the whole game, or even in the case of the quick time event, would require you atleast push something to cause or prevent a particular outcome.This is just a etchi/hentai style novel with music and character images which fade in and out as the characters ""walk"" in and out of the scenes.The plotline is kind meh, but if we take a look at most hentai out there, they can be a good deal worse, so I'll give it a pass in this category for now; even if I don't care a lot for some of the dialogue out of the protagonist (whom your supposedly viewing everything from his point of view).However, what is unforgiveable is the constant rehashing of the same pose for the same character for everything, I understand there is a limit to how much artwork you can get done, but when a person changes facial expressions/moods, they tend to also change stance as well to better emote that emotion.  Even on the store page you can blatantly see the sword girl has that same positioning between her regular image and when she wears a kimono (which lacks the sword entirely) and thus looks awkward.  Even hentai of the manga variarity get that bit right.Don't get me wrong, there are a few moments where they ""change it up"" but those moments tend to be the stuff that are a still image all together, and only on the moments that are suppose to show the near if not complete nudity of the girl they are currently focusing on.  You spend about 15 minutes (if your reading the dialogue and viewing the images at the same time) with the standardized and boring fade in and out character settings, and maybe 2 to 4 minutes on only one of these still images (also if you still read the dialogue).Is this worth $10? No. No its not.However if it goes on sale for a particularly cheap price (half or less), then maybe it will be worth the price; otherwise there are plenty of free places to get good hentai out there, or if your into visual novels, theres also some good free visual novels out there as well.Also, minor issues I've noticed here and there as far as the dialogue is concerned: there is atleast one or two typos in the first fourth of the novel. Not a big deal since I still could disern what was intended to be said, and also usually you'd want this sort of thing for the visuals alone."

This is not an RPG, there is only 1 point at which you may select from multiple dialog options, and regardless of what you pick the ending will be that same. This dialog option will effect the next few scenes of the novel, but it will reconnect with the other option's path after a short time. This plot isn't the best quality about this game, its quite generic and predictable. The highlight of this game would be the the high quality artworks. This game has a lot of nudity and partial nudity, so play at your own eyes expense. I reccomend this game only because it is accurately advertised with the videos you find on the store page, I would not recommend actually playing this game unless what you're looking for is a cheaply put together story with high quality perverted images. I personally enjoyed this game because i didn't think the game makers would actually take the sex jokes and perversion as far as they did, so it has no replayability for me since its no longer a surprise, but was interesting in the first playthrough."

My complaints for this was the price and what it actualy was. $10 is a bit over priced cause its only replay value is the equvalent of reading a manga again. In the future i hope they acutaly draw out more scenes and actually add more stances and posses for the characters and their emotions. This visual novel lacks alot but its got a good story.

I also liked the background music, never did I find it disrupting and most of the time it was appropriatefor the situation, I did find there wasn't too much different scores...the dialogue was mostly funny and there were some good moments (not spoiling anything here since... well... it's so short everthing I spoil will be a major spoiler...).but the ""This game includes nudity and explicit sexual dialog."" warning you get is well~ barely applicable. there were some moments but nothing really too much.As for the €10,- price tag, It's a bit much for the amount of time you get to spend with the VN, one run through on auto play will take you around 4h, default settings. if you are a fast reader you'll finish it in half time most likely. I would recommend to buy it in a sale.I really enjoyed the game, but I wish there was more replayability, the lack of choices and the amount of time you can spend with the game is just too little.On the other hand, I really enjoyed the art, the music and the dialogue.In the end I will recommend the game, but I also would recommend to wait untill Sakura Spirit is being discounted for at least 50% or more."

For starters, the story is okay, it's about a young Judo athlete aspiring to become a national-level athlete suddenly being brought into a different world where he meets moderately busty, mischievous fox girls along with a tsundere human. The story goes on from there and it's the games strong highlight. It creates emotions and ties the player to the characters greatly. I, for one, have taken a great liking to Machiko, the older sibling of the two fox sisters. She is a darkened skin, moderately busty fox women with a flirty attitude. The game has taken great strides to entice players to bond with the characters. Along with the emotions created through the exciting story, the game also displays great visuals with each of the main female characters having a medium to large bust with breasts that defy gravity. This can be seen as a positive or negative aspect of the game seeing as people have different opinions and choice tastes. The same has solid functionality, sporting a good options menu and save/load functionality along with quick saving and loading during your play through. As you play the game you can unlock images of the several characters in game. There is also a help menu to teach you how to play the game in case you're a laughable, short-sighted retard with motor skills deficiency. In all, the game is a good purchase for the current 2$ CAD.

There are quite a few girls in this novel and they all want to get down and dirty with the main character badly. The main character however, is not interested in them. So the game is not a very good eroge game.Someone will say: ""It is only meant as a tease, the novel is not trying to be an eroge game, just a good visual novel"".That would be great! Seeing as this is Steam, I did not expect an eroge game anyway! But because the novel is trying to be flirty with you, it kind of forgets to add a serious storyline.

There is onlyONE CHOICE IN THE WHOLE GAME, WITH ONLY TWO OPTIONS TO SELECT.And the worst is that this ""choice"" barely matters at all.The fun of visual novels is to be able to replay the story differently. It works best when you need to play all the ""branches  of the story tree"" in order to truly figure out what is going on. When the game involve sexy girls and romance, being able to romance the one you like is also a major incentive to play a game like this.But there is none of that in Sakura Spirit. Just one path in which you interact a bit with all the girls, but can't choose one. And I'm not even talking about unlocking romantic/erotic scenes : you can't even decide to spend more time with your favorite girl in order to talk and learn more about her!It is not a game : it is a digital picture book for teen and adult anime fans.I guess technically that makes it a ""visual novel"", but without interaction, why purchase this rather than watch an anime or comic which will have more pictures and be more dynamic?If I can't play a role in the story, I'll just watch a technically more elaborate story with roughly the same subject. And there are legions of those (""Izumo - Takeki Tsurugi no Senki"" comes to mind).The worst part about Sakura Spirit is that since there is one (meaningless) choice into the game, it means that the game engine actually supports a tree-structure narrative......And that means that implementing different branches for the different girls and/or more choices would have been quite easy for the developers.Just 10% more work from them would have made the game 200% more enjoyable.Even if you didn't give us a branch per girl, at least giving us some conversation options to vary the dialogue would have been a step up...It is truly a shame. My hopes is that the developers will use critiques like those and the money they earned in order to remaster the game, by adding choices and girl-specific events. Steam would allow this and it would actually be a great consumer-friendly upgrade and gift for people who have purchased the story.Will the devs do this gesture of good will? I sure hope they do."

About 1.3 hours into the game, I got to make a decision.From this point on, it seems I might even have more choices to make. But Ye Gods, that was a long introduction sequence... O.o"
,Recommended,313740,13926961,"Posted: 10 January, 2015",all,Weydabomb,"So, after having played this game for an hour, I can honestly give you a full-fledged review.First things first, if you buy this, everyone will judge you. I originally did not want this as I am not a fan of graphic novels nor am I a fan of the ultra-flamboyant colors and atmospheres advertised by this game. However, due to the hilarious reviews, appeal of unrealistic bust size, as well as the price drop by 66% during a weekend sale, I decided to buy it for around $4.00.Now, as a ""game"" this is an absolutely♥♥♥♥♥♥game. There are no choices to be had, there are no interactive sequences, there is nothing even remotely related to a game. I guess you could say the gallery collecting is somewhat game-like but to achieve 100% gallery you literally have to abuse your left mouse button. The story, visuals, and dialogue progress by you clicking. In fact, you don't even have to do that as there is an option to pace the screens.Do not be fooled by the claim ""dating sim."" Unless you're dating a porn actor or you're paying big $$$, there is no relationship that will EVER be like this. I will take an analogy from this story as proof. // You are walking down a trail by a river with two female companions, one of them runs off and jumps in the river and begins screaming ""HELP, I CAN'T SWIM"" you save her, she is unconscious, you decide to do mouth to mouth CPR, she wakes up just before your lips meet, she then starts flirting with you and demands you take her clothes off, you help unwillingly (unwillingly because your character is a ""17-year-old rising judo star with no knowledge AT ALL of female anatomy), you get knocked out, you wake up beside her in a bed naked // If you have a first encounter with a lady that goes like this, you should run. Run fast and don't look back.Overall it's *enjoyable* (wink/nudge/wink/wink) I like scantily clad ladies with large *personalities* as much as the next guy, but it an AWFUL ""game."" It's much more of a visual novel with a shallow cliche story than it is anything else.I rate it the br-best visual novel on Steam."

Excellent to enjoy for ironic reasons, just know what you're getting intoHonestly? Not the worst VN I've played on Steam.The advisory and the screenshots/previews will tell you everything you can come to expect from this game. It's porn. Instead of simulating sexual activity, it aims to have a sense of humour, and much of the fanservice is associated with lewd humour and wacky misunderstandings. It misses more often than it hits, and the plot and writing isn't winning any awards for outstanding quality, but it has its moments. More likely, it will amuse you for unintentional reasons, considering how loony it is.It's a static VN for the most part; I clocked in at roughly 3 hours, so it's not a long read (they promise subsequent episodes). It's not a long game. You might want to wait on a sale, $10 for 3 hours of gameplay isn't a good return.It's a competently-made game. No issues with the UI or music and the art is generally appealing; there are signs of laziness with the character poses never changing throughout the story. The fan service stills are also appealing, but undermined by them sticking around longer than needed, even as the dialogue continues to progress; at some point, you are going to try and ignore the barely-clothed amazon facing you to keep reading what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on.For all its shortcomings, there are 2 things to state. It is a porn, and, moreover, it is an absolute delight to enjoy ironically. This is one of those ""so bad it's good"" games that you should be getting your mileage from pure ironic enjoyment. Bring a friend and tear the game a new one, it will be a fun romp.If you're part of the demographic that enjoys big busty anime girls, or just want a game to enjoy for an evening for ironic purposes, this should satisfy your tastes. This is nowhere near being a good VN on Steam, but it occupies a niche no other release can approach. Check your brain and standards at the door and you'll be fine."

,Not Recommended,313740,11239343,"Posted: 14 July, 2014",all,Ahobaka,"Not really sure what to make of this game. I went in expecting more of a full game, but got something more akin to a demo version.The game drew me in with the artwork and I was hoping for some interesting choices or paths down the storyline. But there's literally only one option and all it changes is what Gallery CG you unlock. The ending it results in is still the same, no matter what choice you make.It's clear that the devs want to make more out of this, going by the ending card message. Here's to hope that they improve on what they have and add some more meat to the whole game, because right now it's looking pretty slim.As I said before, the artwork is pretty good. Although the design is very hit or miss on the characters, Tsuyuri standing out the most, not matching any of the others in any way or form. The cast of ""villains"" is just a case of copy/paste with differently coloured hair and eyes.Storywise it's quite lacking. The background story is way too short and thin, you don't know anything about the main character apart from him being a ""Rising Judo Star"" and see traces of him being a stuttering and silly carbon copy of most bland animé MC's with a little dash of Gary Stu over him. The girl cast is nice, but you hardly get to know them in the short time that you get to play (aka: read) the game. Just when you get to the point that you start to see some development, it ends.Then there's the writing. Sentences have very stiff structure, some come out almost as if they were translated literally from Japanese even though the game is English from the start. Some sentences have several spelling errors and grammar issues. The main writer also seems to have a fetish for the word ""seemingly"". So the game could do with some serious quality checking, including a couple of editors and proof readers before getting released.So in short, would I recommend this game for VN / Eroge fans? Not really. You'll get some light fanservice, nothing overly lewd. The writing is subpar and the ending way too quick with nothing really major in terms of choices. I have to give it to the devs for the art though, for being their first (?) game it is quite well done. But other than that this doesn't really go to any great lenghts to improve on the genre."

I had assumed it would be some sort of choose your own adventure type of story... but it ended up being a completely linear sequence of typo-laden text with horrible writing, repeated images, and little in the way of discernable plot.Again, making this clear to anyone who might be poised to buy this: There are no choices. There is little story. There is no dialogue.

It'll tease you, but it'll never deliver, so if you're looking for naked anime girls, look elsewhere.  But once you get the semi-naked girls out of the way, what you have here is actually pretty decent- if it's on sale.The storyline is a bit simple- you're a guy who has an upcoming judo match, and he wants to pray at a specific shrine to ash for luck in an upcoming tournament.  When he does, he ends up falling into the past, meeting a bunch of overly-developed girls- a pair of kitsune who are tormenting the town, and the two guards who are trying to stop them.  Long story short is, you're there to try and broker peace between the humans and spirits before things go too far.  How do you do this- a fight?  A multiple-choice conversation path?  Nope.  Your success is automatically guaranteed- there's only one real choice to make, and it just tells you what path you take to the ending and who you spend that path with.  You can either choose to spend time with the kitsune, or with the two guard girls- the ending will not change, though.I would say that while this VN is actually pretty good (once you get past the whole half-naked girls thing), it's not worth ten bucks.  Grab it on a sale and expect to get three hours or so of play out of it, maybe more if you let it idle for cards.Part of me wishes that there would be a sequel with more depth to it, with multiple endings, but I doubt that'll happen- or that there'll even be a sequel."

At least it actually functions properly, and doesn't have an issue with running on ALL OTHER brands of GPUs except the one the developper used when creating it!The game actually runs smoothly, and despite the story being, of course, shallow and uneventful at times, at least, it's bareable, and makes looking at the well drawn♥♥♥♥♥♥and asses conveniently censored to keep the shallow minded community on Steam happy, at least tolerable.I'd say, if you're looking specifically for a game to fap to? This is as good a game as it gets if you're for some reason deciding to look for these games on a 3rd party software whose TOS directly doesn't allow full on sexual games.The controls are very customizable, allowing you to choose whether the game should progress on its own, and how fast/how many seconds it takes between frames to appear, or for new text to appear. You can also simply have it set to remain on the same page until you click any key. This gives the possibility of maximum storyline immersion, or maximum fap capability, depending on your individual desires.Regardless, I recommend this game purely due to the type of game it is. It would be unfair to rate this game compared to the rest of the games on Steam, as this is hardly a 'game' and more a story telling session, with lots of blushing boobs and conveniently nude, but not revealing, bodies.I'd say, for what it is? It's one of, if not the, best Ecchi game on Steam, and if you're deliberately looking for this sort of game(BAKA HENTAI! D: ), then I'd definitely say that this one is the best option for you."

The game manages to beautifully blend elements of mystery, suprise and world class dialogue, among other things, in order to create what has been come to be known as a masterpiece of gaming. The game's usage of slight erotic tension to make a social commentary on the importance of control of sexuality was absolutely surperb. (incoming potential spoilers) The way that the main character Takahiro, or as the lovely ladies and spirits of the game say Taka-nii, constantly refuses to take advantage of the women of Sakura Spirit is a commentary on the tendency of males to take advantage of women. The developers are intending to make a feminist statement about the world we live in by contrasting the fictional environment of Sakura Spirit. Because you, as the player, are living vicariously through Taka-nii, his tendencies and values are transcribed onto you as the player. Because Taka-nii chooses not to objectify and use the women of the world, these values are therefore transcribed onto you. As such, Sakura Spirit is attempting to make positive feminine statements about men taking advantage of women, even when they are not fully in control of themselves (Maeko-chan's post magic haze and Miyo-chan's drunken bath). However unfortunately the same cannot be said about the tendencies of the game to♥♥♥♥♥♥Shame. On multiple occasions the clothing or lack thereof is commented negatively on by the protaganist, as per the aforementioned transcription, the values are then put on the player. Whilst my feminist core urges me to be angry at the game for the♥♥♥♥♥♥Shaming, I can't help but forgive the game because of all the other fem positive elements as well as, feminism aside, the great core game. The game is absolutely amazing, especially for it's time. The dialogue is, as previously mentioned, word class, it blends elements of sarcasm and seriousness in an attempt to create an environment that helps to flourish intellectual discussion about the elements the game sets forth. The art style and visual elements of the game are absolutely amazing, the style would be considered all round generic and in fairness it is very similar to popular styles, however developers of Sakura Spirit manage to take the original style and portray it in a way that contributes to the  current trends of animesque art. Now we come to the core element of the game: Characters. The character construction and development throughout the game is extremely exquisite and depicts great strong powerful women throughout the game. The development of the individual characters is done in such a way that the player cannot help but be left confused and unknowing which girl they like the most.All Round Great Game; 10/10P.S Maeko is best girl."

You know the kinds of things that it's going to try, but you don't quite know exactly when it's going to do it. As a piece of narrative, Sakura Spirit is relatively engaging as the main character is actually well-written. The writer clearly has either great insight into the kind of person that Takahiro is or he/she has great command of certain characters. I say certain as some of the characters do come across as rather bland and seem to exist only as vehicles for the jack-in-the-box tricks. Even the character after which this game is named is one of the most two-dimensional characters that I have ever seen. That being said, I found that the writer and the artist both do have their talents, but they should look back upon this game as a learning experience, finding out how to make some of the other characters more believable and learning how to create proper tension. I felt that the lack of motion on-screen and soundtrack cues took away from the overall experience. This all aside, I found Sakura Spirit to have its own unusual charm. The over-the-top Ecchi and contrived plot are things that I find adorable. If it were to take a Saints Row-esque path in future titles, wallowing in its own over-the-top-ness and improving the writer's talents as the games go on then I think that this series can go far. Why does a toddler laugh at a jack-in-the-box? Yeah, I don't know either."

The story isn't bad, however there are cliches that are associated with anime tropes. As for the game's warning of ""sexual content including nudity."" Meh considering manga titles it isn't that bad really. Lots of side boob, but no actual nudity. So if anything it'd be rated for older teens to be honest. It would have been nice if there were more backgrounds for the scenes that were described but not shown. All in all, 8/10. Wait for a steam sale to get it."

That's the whole thing. Done. It's essentially a prologue so there's no payoff to anything that happens, the plot thread we came here for never (which is ""Romance"" [and by romance I mean bone] someone) gets resolved... It just ends. Literally just ends, as any other VN would be getting started. It was funny whilst it lasted, but man, I am dissapointed in it and it's runtime. Literally had ONE choice the entire game and it changes about 5 minutes at the end of the game, with basically no consequences from it. I skipped through it again to check if more opened up after what I guess you'd call the ""intro tour"", but there was just nothing but that one meaningless decision.To wrap up. When I can go find completely free VNs that go for longer without even leaving steam, I can't ever possibly reccomend this unless it's on sale stupidly cheap, considering I can get a LOT more similar content for free on any number of easily reachable platforms.

This means their are really no choices to be made that effect the outcome or change the events* , you are here to read the story and enjoy the artwork.*(Technically there is one choice that effects which group of girls you spend time with at the festival near the end of the game but it has no impact on the actual story and the game can be saved before making this choice and you can quickly replay the different scenes before it carries on as normal)The story involves a young rising Judo star, nervous about a big match coming up, who whilst praying at a supposedly magical shrine to calm his nerves is whisked away to another world. Here he meets two female fox spirits who are at odds with a nearby village and the young female warriors of said village. The young man must help both groups come to understand one another whilst finding a way back home and preventing the village from being attacked by other spirits.When it comes down to it the story is tired and predictable, however the writing and descriptions are very good, and these almost make up for the lacklustre plot. Likewise each of the female characters are pretty much your standard animé stereotypes and although there are a few flashes of deeper character these never really develop much or are forgotten once they start fawning over the main character...which they all do of course. Sadly very little is done with the characters from the normal world that are introduced.This is a ""fan-service"" VN designed to titillate male players, and there is nothing wrong with that and the game does this well. however there is very little on offer for anyone else The artwork and backgrounds are good although lacking variety and the occasional CG image of a scene (usually of the girls in ""fan-service"" poses) are all very well drawn. The music is ok, a few tracks repeated for different types of scenes but non of them are particularly unpleasant...the real downside is that there doesn’t seem to be any voice work.It took about two and a half hours to finish, that includes going back and seeing the festival with both groups, there isn't really any replayablitiy (my total playtime includes the time for mining trading cards). At full price this is a difficult product to recommend however if it's on sale, I’ve certainly read/played worse VNs.Quick Summary:-+ ""Fan-Service""+ Well written dialogue and descriptions+ Funny+ Nice Artwork- Predictable/Stereotypical Characters/Plot- Linear- Short with no Replayability"

There are several suggestive images and some suggestive dialogue (some very much so) but no actual nudity (though it comes close) and no 'sex scenes', just flirting.With all that said, the game is fun, pretty tame if you're a rational adult and especially so if you're a Hentai fan (sorry, keep looking for torrents on your favourite websites).  It's short, I enjoyed the characters and was genuinely fond of a couple by the end of the game.  There's a few erros with the dialogue in places but nothing awful and given the brevity, the limited amount of content and the very tame nature, I honestly wouldn't want to pay full price for it, given what else is availabe for $10.I do sincerely hope there is a sequel and that it makes it to Steam soon and honestly, I would favour it being just as suggestive but ultimately more explicit.  If it's going to be labelled as such, due to US hangups, might as well make it worth the rating, without getting unnecessary.Although there are certainly other games in this genre that are better, in my estimation, I have never seen any of them on Steam or similar platforms, indeed many are only available to English speakers from questionable sources, unfortunately.  For that reason alone, I would have to recommend buying this if you are at all a fan of visual novels, erogames, manga, etc.  As the US is well aware, ""Money Talks"" and if games like this make Steam significant revenue, simple economics will lead to them stepping up to fill that demand.Rating the game directly, on the enjoyment I had and its content, I would give 7/10.  It could have been a 9/10 without the minor errors and with about twice the length and some more branching.  10/10 is going to require them to really step up their game and take some risks, too, in my opinion."

I have bought other visual novels for maybe 20 bucks that had 15+ hours of content at least and this may give you 3 hours at most with the first playthrough depending upon how quickly you read. So, yes, it is quite short.Also, the ending is very unsatisfactory. There is all this buildup for the plot and you are expecting a couple of climactic scenes throughout the story that never actually happen which is a huge letdown. The end almost hints at a sequel which seems really unnecessary.The ecchi situations the main character gets into are pretty ridiculous. One scene you will be thinking, ""How can you not know that what you are doing is a clear indication that you want sex?"" I found the scene really amusing but not in the best way.There is only one choice throughout the story. ONE. So if you like making choices and that's one of your criteria for good visual novels then just don't bother. The choice also really has no impact on the story whatsoever.There are also inconsistencies where the girls in this alternate world do not understand customs or terms of speech from the main character's world but somehow know others they should not know as well. *Spoiler* Covering yourself in chocolate and asking your friend to lick it off you is not how you improve a ""friendship."" You are going into a whole different territory.The text has a ton of huge grammatic, sentence structure, and other language problems. And when I say a ton I mean a TON. It was almost unbearable to have to reread every other sentence at times to figure out exactly what was being said. And a lot of the time the same word would have the exact same incorrect word that replaced it which makes it seem like it was run through a translator or something and nobody even bothered to revise it.Now I may have seemed kind of harsh and you're thinking ""how did he give this a thumbs up?"" but I'll get into the positives.The artwork is extremely well done and there is a fair share of ecchi pics so they don't cheat you there. I'm actually surprised that steam allowed this game on here because it is borderline nudity at some scenes.The characters are very likable even if they do have certain stereotypical personalities many of you may find often in your typical ecchi/comedy anime.The main character is not a wimp but he also isn't a complete badass either. He can handle himself and isn't too OP so he is a very balanced character overall with a pretty good personality, even though I thought some dialogue with the girls was not typical for girls you have just met.Now I guess I'm neutral with the rest.Typical story you'd pretty much find anywhere else that isn't bad but really isn't referred to as much as it should.Ecchi scenes are so completely random that even by manga/anime standards it is silly. I know you have your typical ""I wandered into the hot springs by accident while girls were in it"" moment, but having it happen every ten minutes or so is pushing it. That being said, it was bearable and the end result could be rather convincing.Overall, I'm surprised by the number of negatives I said in relation to positives because in actuality I finished the damn thing. I kind of have a hobby now of collecting visual novels and I don't really regret having this one in my collection, especially since it seems like there will be updates for this. My recomendation, wait a little while before getting this game or even wait a while for a sale.So I give this novel a thumbs up (barely) because everyone has different tastes. If you like ecchi and don't mind a story that isn't all that great but has likeable characters then I say give this one a chance in your collection. If you are looking for a somewhat deep plot with a little conflict then this is definitely not a visual novel for you.Hope the review itself helps more than the actual rating. :)"

Though did my perception change when i actually played it, lemme tell you.Art - 9/10The characters look amazing, the backgrounds work so well with the story that is being told and above all else - a great looking shot of each of the characters throughout the story in a provocative position or pose. This may sound inevitable given  the warning steam gives about the game but lordy you aren't prepared.Sound - 8/10Music worked well but it needed more sound effects and possibly voice acting could've been a great feature. But apart from that, yeah, the music always sets the right tone.Story - 9/10You wanna do the fighty thing. Appear in alternate world. Fox spirits think you cute and take you to their home where they sleep naked next to you and then tell you their backstory before helping to save a village. Not much else I can say.replayability - 9/10It's not a very long game but if you opt out of using skip mode or holing down space, then you get time to just re-read the story and pick up certain details you missed or subtle/obscure references that aren't always quite obvious; you get to choose the choices you didn't pick on your first playthrough (granted there aren't many). just seeing your favourite character nearly-fully naked again is an added bonus.Overall - 8.9/10Enjoyable little visual novel and certainly one of the best available on steam in my opinion."

Bonus points if you like fox-girls.Plenty of general videogame and anime references that confuse the heck out of the other charactersPlenty of good jokes (""Considering the Grand Canyon lurking underneath [Nagami's] clothes, I doubted I'd be able to endure the sight"")Sublime art quality - those CGs are amazing, and not just because of the sexy!Good scripting - the protagonist is actually relatively genre-savvy. Decent character development considering the length of the game. The fight scenes are pretty well written, although it feels like a couple CGs would have done nicely in the fights.I think the typos mentioned in other reviews have been fixed - I haven't spotted any, myself.However: as a visual novel and game, compared to others of its kin, it somewhat falls flat. There's only one storyline choice (which affects the last part of the story before the ending, and both are necessary for all CGs) and the whole thing lasts about an hour if you're a quick reader like me. Also, the save function is more of a bookmark - and also a fast track to said story-line split.Totally worth the read/fap, especially if it's on special offer. Giggity."

Voiceless, generic japanese style music and with its graphics meant to obviously attract the male (teenager aged) audience, I was rather bored with it within minutes of playing.This is not to say that this is a bad visual novel, as I'm likely spoiled by visual novels that had actual (usually complicated) plot, multiple paths and endings, so take this review from a 30-ish year old man with a grain of salt. While bland for me, it's several steps above my tolerance levels compared to the official Baldur's Gate novel....Before anyone complains, I said the official NOVEL of it, not the game. There's a difference, look it up.Anyways, As far as I can tell, this is likely the developers first game ever from my searches on the internet, so it can somewhat explain why the game is bland to me. Could the developer improve? Only if he or she is willing to be, so I can only hope so."

I bought it on a sale, so didn't expect too much out of it but was pleasantly surprised. Story starts off by introducing the main character, who is rather nervous about an upcoming judo match that will make or break his future within the sport. Thinking it can't hurt he goes to a shrine located close to his school to pray for good luck, after which the story starts in earnest. Transported to a new world remiscient of old Japan and introduced to the four girls, he finds himself thrust into a small quest to make peace between the rogue spirits and the human villagers.There's only one choice to be made in the game, unlike the other visual novels I've tried which had quite a few. Also unlike others of its genre there are no real ""routes"" and you see roughly equal amount of all the girls, though the ending seems to imply this is but a prologue. Another thing that's slightly misleading is the ""nudity"" tag, since there's no actual nudity.I'd mention what I thought were pros and cons if I actually had any semblance of experience with dating sims, but because I don't I'll just skip that. In conclusion, this was well worth the price I got it for (roughly 3€) and look forward to the sequel."

I'll give it a reccomendation cause i enjoyed the story, but there really needs to be done alot to it to justify the 10 buck price mark, add more choices, more paths, more choices more ....stuff..."
