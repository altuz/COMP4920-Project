,Recommended,313810,17257961,"Posted: 27 July, 2015",all,Uncle Benjen,Very good remaster of a fun game I played on PS2 almost 10 years ago.Pros:- Great platforming- Fluid and challenging combat- A lot of variety in activities and challenges- New textures look great- Comic book cutscenes are cool- Very nice soundtrackCons:- Voice acting needs improvment- Script outside of comic cutscenes is quite poor at times- Camera can be annoying at times (especially in constrained areas)8/10

These sort of kid like platforming games is what pc honestly needs.+ Great graphical update from the original+ Combat is great among most hack & slash games, its pretty solid on all levels+ Platforming is fun and brings you back to when platformers weren't only 2d indie hardcore platformers+ The sound is a huge bump up in quality, although I did experience a few very minor odd sound placements but I won't detract any points from it+ Runs great on a 1080p monitor and at 60 fps, so all the resolution problems people are talking about are foreign to me+ Beautiful levels+/- Quests are what you'd expect from games like this, fetch whatever to do whatever or activate some thing, personally I had never thought of this as a problem but you be the judge+/- Voice acting in my opinion is great for me, its the original voices (I believe) and sure while the protraying of the emotion is laughable its far from being unbearable nor does it detract from the feeling of the game at all+/- The camera needs a bit of work since it feels like its pointing more so to the ground, not really giving you the control of having a full 360 view of the world, so seeing whats ahead of you is a bit of a mystery until it hits you like a boar. Pretty sure this was the same problem with the original so I don't hugely mind but if this can be addressed i'd say it'd be pretty welcome.+/- This is my own personal gripe on two points, unskipable dialouge and the UI. With the original dialouge you could just skip past boring tutorials an other small quick conversations. The original UI, while not styleized in its sort of Chinese style with paintbrushed texts and scrolls and whatnot it feels too bare. The way it was in the original was even more akin to a Chinese style with having a Jade stone background where the health and items were so i'm not sure why they changed ithttp://s.pro-gmedia.com/videogamer/media/images/ps2/legend_of_kay/screens/legend_of_kay_30.jpgQuick comment about the weapons and armor if anyone is curious and hasn't ever played this, you can get 3 types of weapons with around 2 upgrades each (If I remember right) if you exclude the base weapon which changes the apperance quite a bit and of course the damage outputs. The 3 main types are the sword, claws and the hammer. There are also 3 different types of armor, Jade, Red colored armor and cool looking black armor.This game is in every way a must buy if you want to relieve your past of 3d platforming, I don't wholey remember how long it took me to beat the game, since as a kid I had the IQ level of a bug, but i'd say its safe to assume you'd clock in at least around 7 hours, give or take. It all entirely depends how fast you rush through but this game should honestly be taken at a steady pace, it just feels so good to play it.Edit: Looking at my current time this game will probably take you longer than 7 hours to beatThey also say b*stard twice for an E rated game, if I was a kid I would feel so edgy right now"

,Not Recommended,313810,29738629,Posted: 6 February,all,"""Bob"" the Space Cadet","Legend of Kay seems like a good idea, and it gets a lot of good reviews, but that's often the problem with remasters - people get all nostalgic and look past the flaws.In six hours of gameplay the toughest fight I had was with the camera. It frequently locks into a position where I can't look in the direction of upcoming obstacles or platforms, which results in missing many jumps and getting knocked down by many things.The story is pretty dull. A martial arts trainee is spoken of in some prophecy and must save the village (along with some neighbouring villages). The game has voice acting, but many of the characters are written in a horrible way that makes the game seem laden with casual racism, rather than the voice actors just having those accents naturally.I didn't finish Legend of Kay, but I don't feel like punishing myself any further. Six hours was more than enough, and there are much better third person action/adventure games on Steam - Psychonauts, The Last Tinker: City of Colours, and Oceanhorn, for example."
,Not Recommended,313810,32633188,Posted: 21 June,all,TerribleLiar,"To sum up this game, I'd say ""nothing special.""It's a standard action platformer from the PS1/PS2 era. You'll explore and fight enemies. Unlike most action platformers, this one focuses more on fighting. Which is strange because there are not that many enemy types. You fight rats, rats with bombs, gorillas with axes, gorillas with maces, (teenage mutant) ninja turtles, crocodiles, and various animals and plants. But then you have the most difficult enemy, the camera. This is most easily one of the worst cameras in any video game. In tight spaces you're definitely fighting it. Aside from that, combat doesn't have much variety and feels like a chore for the most part.Exploring is mostly just doing what the game wants you to do. Platforming has the same problem that combat does, in that you're fighting the camera a lot trying to not fall into pits. Pits are strange because falling in one makes you go back to the last checkpoint instead of just losing a heart, so if you fall in a pit during a fight, you'll have to do the whole fight again (and your health is what it was when you fell minus 1). Puzzles are mostly finding a number of cat statues (seriously, why so many cat statues everywhere throughout the world?) to continue, and they're not incredibly hidden.I also had a problem playing on a 144Hz monitor. With vsync on, the game strangely ran at 93 FPS constantly. But animations are at least somewhat tied to framerate, as cutscenes were always messed up for me. Characters ran too far and were obviously not where they were supposed to be, and right at the end of the game, there was one hazard that I had to die to the first time because the sped up animation made it kill me before I could move. Luckily the game lets you skip cutscenes you've seen, so I just did it again and skipped that so I could actually progress. So it was nothing gamebreaking, just really annoying.Another thing that really irks me is the target audience. I thought it was for children. The main character is a kid and is pretty terribly voice acted, and the theme and appearance is mostly happy (excepting the whole being conquered by an evil race of gorillas) and cartoony. But it has quite a bit of cursing in it, which makes you wonder who this game is for.Overall, this is a very forgettable game. I'm not sure why they remastered it honestly. It doesn't do anything new or do anything the best, so you're missing absolutely nothing at all by not playing it. And it's not the most fun game ever, and I'm sure I'll completely forget everything about it in a month."

The soundtrack is lovely, the gameplay is smooth and despite the nostalgic feel of this classic collect 'em, bash 'em platformer it doesn't feel dated at all. Legend of Kay provides relatively simple gameplay without being lackluster, the storyline is pleasant and engaging and though the cutscenes are a little lengthy at times there's hardly any cause for complaint if you're after a fun, easy-going action-adventure game."
76561198000652940,Recommended,313810,17294489,"Posted: 30 July, 2015",all,AftermathFox,"This game is a great combat-based platformer with branching paths and a bit of exploration. Yes, the voice acting is bad, but it doesn't interrupt the fun parts of the game. This game takes a new spin on combat through its use of the three weapons and offering the player enough choices to conquer each fight.The only upsetting aspect of this game was its difficult camera controls. Some times you will have to back away from the action in order to move the camera into the correct position or else run the risk of getting hit. Often, the game tells you where the enemies are, but it would've been nice to see what they were doing as well.Overall, the combat aspects of this game are incredibly unique and refreshing compared to most hack-and-slash games. I highly enjoyed the challenge of Nightmare difficulty, and I hope that Kaiko develops more games like Legend of Kay."

,Recommended,313810,19546436,"Posted: 7 December, 2015",all,Lartay,"Remake of the PS2 version from 2005. While this remake will appeal mostly to the people who have played it before, if you're a fan of 3D Adventure Platformers then I recommend you give it a tryIt's been done really nicely, it controls well and is identical to the original. My only complaints are the camera, cutscenes and the voice acting; all are a bit janky at times. Unfortunately there are no graphical options but it does run at the same resolution as your monitor, in full screen and very smoothly. Try not to tab out, it doesn't like this.Cutscenes seem to be out of time to the voice acting but matches perfectly in-game, just a warning.Overall I recommend you give it a try, especially if you've played it before. There aren't enough 3D Platormers that take me back to the days of Sly and Ratchet and Clank. There's nothing quite like replaying a great old game you thought everyone had forgotten about.

The game progresses linearly in levels of zones, and has many puzzles, most of which are optional.The game was originally relased for the Playstation 2 in 2005 and is based on the artstyle of 3D JRPGs at the time, (but its not really that weeby).The games strong points:+ Superbly optimised+ Updated graphics+ Audio touchups (Removal of compression static, but not an overhaul)+ Very good PC controls+ At least 8 hours of well structured, rewarding gameplay+ If you've seen a cutscene before, you can skip it+ Steam Achievements+ Newly added difficulty levels+ Taught 8 year old me 12+ games could have strong swear words+ No frame rate CapThe games weak points:- It's been highly touched up, but this is exactly wat it says it is, an Anniversary Edition, not a complete remaster.- The voice acting is the same, it was quite low budget, but its ok- Unskipable Self dialogue eg.

With a major graphical overhaul, there are few problems with the game that linger. The second Boarax fight scene is made more diffucult due to the camera angle constraints, when using a gamapad atleast. You can leave alot behind if you are not well versed in the game, for example, I haven't played it in a long time and I managed to skip over most Demon portals, finding the Crocodile Tear (Got in through second entrance under the crocodile head, left side.), and the entire fight scene at Frog City, which bummed me the most. The combat held up very well, but is not as difficult as I remembered... All in all, I'd still give it a go today, even if I hadn't played it before-hand.PS.

(I know, its a remaster after all)some of the other reviewers say, the controll is not really good and sometimes very difficult (some of them dont even know what they are doing during fighting). I didnt have any problems at all. it was all fluently and that jumping with Kay is really fun.the controll on jumping on ropes and other platforms are logical for me as it always was back in ps2 days.I hadnt any problems at all with it.of course, the combat system wasnt clear sometimes, but I managed to see through the enemies and used combats like grabbing, defense break and switching to the right weapon on many enemies at the right time. it just needs a bit training.the most negativ in this game is the view for me. I have the feeling you are stucking on the ground and you cant look at the sky at all. thats what really got on my nerves. never had a clearly nice sight of everything.also, it may be that I am an aduld and this is a kids game after all, but that game was with his riddles to easy and that game is only straightforward. i mean, it only goes in one direction, you cant go back in precious levels and the quests youhad are mostly for the story anyway. i wished for more quests to get back to the cat village for example....but you have brokeable armor, which is nice.I recommend this game, because I had fun. It really is a sort of a game I miss to play these days. Also, the combat system is really fun.If I ever will play that game with all achivements, I dont know.

But couldn't bring myself to keep playing.Pros:+ Cats!+ ""Martial arts""+ wild hog riding minigames+ interesting combo mechanic+ No insta-death when falling into waterCons:- voice sync is off (unintentionally like those old kung fu movies)- can't skip laborious exposition dialogues- most voice acting is dull and uninspiring- game crashes after cutscenes- camera controls like emo teenager"

The gameplay is really fun and entertaining, the story is interesting even though the voice acting is pretty weak. It will never compare to big action platformers like Ratchet and Clank or Jak and Daxter but it's really good to play a good action after such a long time. It might not the best game out there but if you're looking for fun I recommend this game."
