,Not Recommended,313830,28550498,"Posted: 22 December, 2016",all,.Loopy.,"Initially Interesting concept that just fell short of being fun4/10Worth the price?:It plays to much like free flash games, just with better graphics, buy on sale.PROS:-Decent FX-Nice to see the leaves/paper move around when you walk by-Voice acting-Game logo is pretty-The cryptic and helpful level titlesCONS:-Puzzles feel very generic-The sound design and music are painful-Uninteresting Story-Plays very slowlyGoing into this game I was hoping for a fresh concept on this puzzle genre, unfortuantly it ended up being like all the rest, avoid the enemies, push some boxes, step on some buttons. See No Evil started out with me feeling immersed in the world and story and wanting to know more about this character I has taken control of, the feeling ended very quickly as the game just became what felt like generic puzzle room after room, losing the sense of adventure I had started out with. As far as difficulty, no level had me stumped, most people should have no issue with solving these puzzles especially if you have already played similar games. All in all this game just didnt meet expectation and ended up falling short, though I did only pay $0.54 so I truly have no reason to complain."

If you are out of good puzzlers, you might give it a shot on sale (my recommendation min. -66%). Not a very bad game. Just doesnt click well enough."
76561198043663357,Recommended,313830,29323449,Posted: 17 January,all,PaleMimic,"There are a number of indie, puzzle games out there, most of them very similar in both concept and functionality. A lot of the time using a simple graphical style, with a mostly basic story-line and more often than not, reusing the same puzzles and mechanics. So what sets See No Evil apart from the endless stream of clones and failures.To begin with I’ll start by mentioning the fact that it’s not too dissimilar from a lot of games in the genre. The puzzles are somewhat familiar; pushing boxes, standing on switches all to reach the level’s exit. There is a bit of twist, however. Sound plays a very important part in the puzzles, in some more than others. Blind but dangerous enemies patrol some of the levels. If they hear your footsteps or your shouting they will hunt you down. Standing still can sometimes help you survive, but very rarely. This gives See No Evil a slight stealth feeling to it. Watching the enemies patrols and waiting for the right moment to move can feel very sneaky sneaky. You can distract them too with bell flowers or huge horns, allowing for you to tiptoe past while they check what’s going on. Some of the puzzles are quite complex and take time to think about before actually setting things into motion. Some blocks will lower when the matching pressure plate is pressed, which in turn can raise other blocks instead. Sometimes enemy patrols will prevent you from getting to where you need to be. There are a number of different obstacles to overcome in order to reach the exit, and as you progress through the game things gets tougher and a lot more complex.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Graphically the game has a charming, hand drawn style to it. Levels are mostly simple, with an obvious theme running through them. Whether its through a crumbling castle, a lush, green woodland or an abandoned factory the style is somewhat refreshing. As well as that, it’s not overly cluttered or distracting, allowing the player to easily see the sound indications as well as which objects can be interacted with and not.The sound effects are very clear as is the music. Each area has a different music track, which at times can get a little bit grating as it plays on a constant loop. But it has a somewhat retro or classic feel to it, along with most of the game for that matter. Even though the game has a dark and foreboding story running through it, the music almost lightens the mood.Talking of the story, you play as a Seer, whatever that is, and are guided by a journal left in your prison cell. You’re opposed by a group of blind evil doers that are afraid of what they don’t know. It’s not all that in-depth, to be fair, but it stops the game from feeling dry and emotionless, not to mention it helps with that feeling of progression.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lastly lets talk about the games mechanics. There are always small problems with indie games, when it comes down to mechanics. Sometimes they’re things not even worth mentioning. But there are some that affect a game in such a way that they can’t be overlooked. In See No Evil there are a small number of glaring mechanical problems. Interactions with certain object require the player to be in a particular spot for it to actually work, which can be frustrating when you might be against the clock or trying to avoid an enemy patrol. Alongside that, some of the walls seem to be made of glue as the player might find themselves getting stuck to said walls. This doesn’t count for every wall, infact I found it to be a rare occurrence, although it was a small annoyance when it did happen. Lastly it would be nice if the player were able to move even a smidgen faster. Moving about the levels seems to take a long time, a small sprint function or maybe just an increase in movement speed would be a welcome thing.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------But, to conclude, I’d say See No Evil feels almost original in its ideas. The graphical style is pleasing to look at and the music is refreshing to boot. The story is lacking however, but I guess you can’t have everything. If you want a different angle on the indie, puzzle genre then See No Evil might be worth your time. Good Day!"

,Not Recommended,313830,33564949,Posted: 15 July,all,Frostbyte,"As a completionist, I forced myself to play the entire thing in order to get every single achievement, and even playing it casually, it was a painful experience.See No Evilis a puzzle game where you manipulate the sound in order to avoid enemies or remove what is blocking your path. It is a nice idea, but poorly executed. This review contain bits of the story that you would comprehend by playing it.Where it shinesAs I have mentioned before,See No Evilhas an awesome idea behind: the majority of humans have decided to cover their eyes to hide themselves from the evils of the world, and you are a Seer - a person that decides to keep their sight, and therefore you are persecuted by the society. Enemies will hunt you through the sounds you make - and eventually, by your scent -, and you can activate or deactivate walls by screaming or by the sound of your footsteps. Great, isn't it?Also, you find more about the story through the narrator every time you complete a level, and they have done a neat job with the voice acting.It's great to add that this is a cheap game and I've seen it more than once on a 90% sale.Where it failsHitboxes in this game are weird, so you'll see yourself hitting a lot of walls and then having to restart the whole puzzle. Talking about the puzzles, loads of them are unrewarding; I almost never felt that I had thought of something unthinkable, most of them involved only timing and running through places that looked like bug exploits.Its achievements are all over the place. Some of them demand that you walk through every single leaf or piece of paper in the whole chapter, and this can easily bug and make you repeat a bunch of levels just so you can get it; others would require you not to die a single time during the whole chapter, and this would end up being extremely frustrating.Even though the voice acting is nice, the Seer's voice isn't. His screams are hideous and playing with an headphone will easily give you a headache.The Seer is slow, so a few easy levels end up taking forever to be completed. And the game is really repetitive, I was never able to play more than an hour at once without getting bored.ConclusionSee No Evilisn't a bad game, it just isn't as motivating and well executed as I wish it was. I can't fully recommend it because of the flaws I have pointed above, but I am sure that people can enjoy it more than I did."

The puzzles are clever and just a handful are a little bit hard to figure out. The concept is also nice, kinda a philosophical journey about self-discovery. The art is simple but it is great. The controls are also good, is easy to play.Found no bugs or crashes. Works fine on win 7.Now, achivements are broken. To me is not that important when the game is good, but some might hate this fact.It's usually pretty cheap, especially on sale, and also includes cards. Is long enough for the money you invest.

,Not Recommended,313830,30605725,Posted: 18 March,all,ＲＥＯＮＡＲＤ,"Keep your eyes closed.Going in, I really wanted to enjoy this game. The synopsis was fascinating, and the reviews were mostly positive. I somehow had it figured for the nextBastion. But after playing it, I can only pictureSee No Evilworking as more of a free internet flash game than something I would pay actual money for.See No Evilis a puzzle game primarily, not the story-rich fable I had gone in expecting. A series of vague, proverbial journal entries from a book you find next to a dead man offer supposed clues to the puzzles you face in each room, and a female narrator occasionaly remarks on your journey as you progress from room to room. As far as I can tell, that is about the extent ofSee No Evil. The gameplay is unbalanced and frustrating. The music and sound design choices are strange, questionable and, at times, uninspired. For example, your character uses sound to navigate and activate parts of the puzzles. While this is an interesting concept, his scream (""Loh!"") gets old quite quickly. Simply adding a few variations of his scream could have alleviated this. An example of unbalanced gameplay is that your avatar moves much slower than your enemies, making them nigh on impossible to avoid when they detect you, and as soon as they do catch you, you must start the puzzle all over, regardless of the progress you may have made. The only checkpoints are at the start of the level. The puzzles, might I add, can become very tedious, and the prospect of starting one over after making a considerable dent in one does not appeal to me very much.Despite all this, I did enjoy the visual aesthetic ofSee no Evil--the style minded me ofBastion--and it did seem like there was an interesting story hidden in there somewhere. However, from a very early point this game failed to catch my attention or stroke my curiosity enough to overcome these shortcomings. All it has done thus far is frustrate, confuse, and dissapoint me, and for these reasons I cannot in good conscience recommendSee No Evil. I shall continue to play, perhaps with the assistance of a walkthrough, but at this point I doubt my oppinion will change.Like my review? Check out myCuratorpage!"
,Not Recommended,313830,32877629,Posted: 27 June,all,DodgerCrow,"Bottom line, there's no reason for me to be solving these puzzles. This type of game has the disadvantage of being unable to keep the player engaged by maintaining a good pace, since said pace is totally dependent on the player. Furthermore, in order to keep a person playing, a puzzle game needs one of two things (though preferably both): a good story/goal to motivate me to solve the puzzles or a sense of satisfaction from doing so. See No Evil lacks both. Up until the last two levels I played, it was mind bogglingly easy. The last two were plain frustrating. None made me feel that essential ""eureka!"" moment. There is simply no reward for being clever. Does it need to give me three star rating like some crappy phone game? No. An A+, million point score because I did my best? Of course not. But _something_ every once in a while would be nice. Maybe tell me why my character decided to see again or give some exposition as to what the hell is going on in this society. You know, something other than some vague narration (which is activaley discouraging me from progressing).(Voice acting on the narration is nice, though. Gotta admit.)The motivation you're supposed to have is you're trying to get to a mountain to scream in a horn and ""wake up"" all the people who decided to cover their eyes and live in blindness, which is apparently all of society. The problem here is twofold: first, while I might have been a little keen on saving the world at the start, that quickly changes when you discover that everyone wants to kill you. Second.... what? I spend the entire game sneaking around and trying not let enemies hear me so I don't get killed, just so I can then scream at them from a mountain? Maybe it's explained in the end, but I honestly couldn't force myself to care. I didn't play through the entire game because I wanted to make sure I could get my refund back, though I was halfway through chapter 3 out of 4 and I don't see it picking up that late into the game. Apparently there's a new game plus where there's more/tougher enemies, but if I could get through chapters 1, 2, and almost 3 in little over an hour, I can't see it taking much more than 4 hours to beat both ng and ng+.The mechanics are interesting, but could use a little work. For example, there is an enemy that fears sound and moves away from it. This is implemented as a sound activated switch that consists of the enemy standing on a button and you having to scare it off in order to lower a barrier and progress. The enemy moves back onto the button after a couple seconds. I discovered, however, that walking so the enemy is no longer on screen freezes it so it won't step back on the button. Not knowing that you can actually keep it off the button makes two specific levels in chapter two unsolvable. I have looked online for solutions to those levels and they all use the same technique of freezing the enemy by leaving the screen.There's ways for sound to travel diagonally by redirecting it through a sort of two sided megaphone, but you can't scream (i.e. make sound) diagonally. In order to use the megaphones that are diagonal you need to stand at a specific distance so that the expanding sound waves from your voice actually go through the funnel at a good enough angle to be registered.The camera is glued to the player and you can't use it to look around, so often you have to (very slowly) walk over to what you want to see, look at it for a second, then (oh so slowly) walk back. I understand and agree with the choice of making the character's speed what it is as some puzzles would be completely broken if he walked much faster. Nevetheless, it would make the game much more enjoyable if you could just drag your mouse over to the edge of the screen to look a little farther, or control the camera a little with wasd if you're moving with the arrow keys. Something like that would remove a lot of unnecessary (and very slow) walking.TL;DR: good idea, good narration. The mechanics need a little work. No motivation to play or keep playing whatsoever. It's not a terrible game, just not fun."

It just dropped on Steam for $15 after a successful Kickstarter campaign earlier this year, and sports a surprising amount of polish.Players are abruptly dropped into a discomforting alternate reality where humanity has sworn off sight and progress in favor of comfort and consistency. Voluntarily shutting their eyes, ostensibly for generations, the protagonist opens his when a body crashes through the roof. Belonging to another Seer, as the dissidents are known, the late individual’s journal is read, line by line, as players advance through the initial set of levels. He must use his newly-acquired sight to escape the dystopian realm.See No Evil is a dark, isometric puzzle game about sound manipulation. A harsh fantasy where the willingly blind are hostile to the nonconformist. Sometimes, the world seems darker with your eyes open. Unfinished, unpolished game.

I get scared and sucked into stories very easily, so just the idea of sneaking around and nearly getting caught because of the sound of my footsteps is enough to raise my heart rate a little bit. The narrator raises interesting questions about the world of the protagonist and the philosophy they live by, and on occasion makes me question my own philosophy. Introspection win right there!I've had no issues with the gameplay itself, very smooth. The art is reminiscent of dystopian novels and movies, everything is familiar (everyone has seen boardwalks, boxes, and flowers) but vaguely unsettling. The soundtrack is okay, it's not too fantastic to distract from the story, but not mediocre or repetitive enough for me to hate it.Having played with both the keyboard and the controller, I recommend the controller because it lets you run SIDEWAYS!"

,Recommended,313830,32904598,Posted: 27 June,all,cresentmoon125,"I absolutely loved this game! It's reasonably challenging without being super frustrating. The puzzles are really clever and thought-provoking, as is the general message. Is ignorance truly bliss? Or is it better to lose what may have once been a paradise for the chance to learn more. Definitely well worth a play! The challenges and achievements also offer a fair amount of replayability as you improve on the skills you learned."
