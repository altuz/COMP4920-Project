,Recommended,313870,13737685,"Posted: 31 December, 2014",all,Tailen,"This little gem of an adventure game grows on you. Despite the main character being from Paris and talking in a German accent, the game is a suitably silly vampire story about an opera singer (who doesn't really believe she's a vampire) trying to escape a castle in Draxsylvania and get back to Paris. Her comedy sidekick bat sits on her shoulder and supplies plenty of sarcasm. There are some memorable characters, the voice acting is pretty good, and there's lots of jokes on just about every clickable object.The controls are decent, a few of the puzzles are illogical, but otherwise bearable, and the story gets better and better as the characters grow.Be warned that it ends sort of abruptly and was supposed to have been a two-parter, but the second game was never made. Some sort of information about that would have been nice up front, but it doesn't actually matter much. It's not too much of a cliffhanger, and the game is enjoyable enough that you can't really feel mad about it. If anything, you're sad you can't spend more time with the characters, but a prequel is in the works, so here's hoping.I couldn't get the game running when launching from steam, but running the exe file in the game folder worked."

The story itself is nothing new with the female seeing an out of a bad relationship that was forced upon her.  She's trapped and looking for a way out of it and to get to Paris.     In some waysthe puzzles and gameplay reminded me of the first Broken Sword game.     And the atmosphere.    The voice acting was rather good and the sense of humor in the game was funny and enjoyable.    At times I felt the puzzles didn't seem to flow well with the story and found myself aimlessly exploring trying to find the next clue which led me into mystery.  The story began to lose some cohesion as I went on so I felt some of this was clumbsy with respect to delivery of the story and puzzles in the game.   The puzzles themselves weren't overly hard but, enjoyable.   At times I would get bored and save the game to find myself coming back to it in 30 minutes time enjoying it some more.    With that saidI found it to be a cutsie , entertaining , get away from the standard hack and slash and shoot em up games I enjoy as well.    Recommended to get it when on sale as a 20 dollar price tag is far too high for this game.NOTE: I am running Windows 8.1 and have experiencd no problems running the game.  My system is up to date with an AMD 8350, 16 gig of ram, Radeon R285 and all windows updates (including optional) installed.  I recommend optional updates as they do typically have game compatibility fixes in them.  But I've run into zero issues with playing this game on a modern computer."

The story is very colorful and the location scenery is relatively easy to navigate except, anywhere that the character is allowed to navigate to, it just show a big red arrow! it won't say: ""Kitchen"" or ""Dungeon"".  As far as getting it to work, I had to go to where the game was installed, in ""game"" folder, I changed the ""libpandadx9.dll"" to ""libpandadx9.dll2"", clicked on ""main.exe"", and on the starting screen, turned the anti-alising down to ""0"", exit to windows, THEN I could start the game like normal.Aside from that, and the fact that this is only ""part 1"" (no one told me, I had to finish the game to find that out) I enjoyed it.

I used to play the DVD release back in 2008/9. Sadly it no longer works with modern operating systems, and publisher responsible for the Steam release few years ago apparently never had any intention to ruin their perfect money grab by fixing the game before the release. Some people have been able to get it to work, but most have not. I'm sadly one of the latter ones, so I am unable to recommend the game at the moment.So if you have an older computer with Windows XP or Windows Vista, go for it. A Vampyre Story is totally worth it if you just have the means to run it."
,Recommended,313870,18541039,"Posted: 17 October, 2015",all,Encephalon,"A Vampyre Story is a 2008 horror comedy graphic adventure set in Europe during the 1890s, and follows a young female opera singer, recently turned vampire named Mona with her trusty sidekick bat companion Froderick as they attempt to make the journey back home to Paris.As with any graphic adventure games, puzzles feature heavily. Most puzzles are creative and challenging and have a logical solution. I didn't however like a particular ""Mix Potions into Different Potions"" type of puzzle as it seems too over-used in graphic adventure games. It shouldn't be too hard for seasoned adventurers, although for me, I have to refer to the walkthrough more then once. Overall it took me around 15 hours to complete the game. Your mileage may vary.This game introduces the concept of an ""idea icon"" in the inventory. Lets say if you attempt to have Mona take a sword, a sword-specific icon, not the actual sword will be added to the inventory. If necessary, Mona will teleport back to the sword, grab it, and teleport back to use it where she's supposed to. While unique, I thought it to be unnecessary. Nevertheless this is one of the game's unique way of distinguishing itself from other titles.The voice acting for all the characters were pretty well done, but I especially enjoyed the playful and witty interactions between Mona and Froderick. Fantastic chemistry between these 2 characters and I really enjoyed the work done by their voice actors. The game also has a very beautiful orchestral and very professionally done soundtrack.That said, there are also some serious shortcomings to this game.Firstly, I understand that due to the age of this game, there are some people who are complaining that it doesn't even run on their computers. I am lucky that I am one of the few who have no such issues running it on Windows 10.Secondly, there is no way to play this game in widescreen mode. The whole game is permanently stuck in a 1024x768 resolution with a 4:3 aspect ratio which means you will never be able to get it to play in fullscreen and will always have 2 thick ugly black bars at the side. In-game video resolutions are even lower then 1024x768 making the whole game look extremely dated in 2015.Then there is the cliff-hanger ending. This entire game is only Chapter One and I understand that it was originally intended to be the first of a 4 part series. Sadly it seems that while a sequel was announced back in 2009, nothing was ever heard of it ever again due to some budget or legal issues with the publisher. As of 2015, it has already been 6 years since the initial 2009 announcement of the sequel. I highly doubt that it will ever be released.Overall Rating: 8.0 / 10Despite its low resolution, aspect ratio and other technical issues, I actually enjoyed the game very much. The cartoony 3D art style, wonderful soundtrack and whimsical story really brought back many fond memories of the good ole days of point-and-click graphic adventures.If you can look past the technical issues that I mentioned and don't mind that the game ends at a cliff-hanger and is unlikely to ever release any sequel, I'd actually recommend this title to anyone who enjoys a good funny story with moderately challenging puzzles."

I was thrilled that it showed up on Steam and I'm very happy my memories of the game weren't just nostalgia, it's very fun and polished. The tone and puzzles are reminiscent of classic LucasArts games and the art is top notch, even by today's cartoon game standards.Some have not liked the voice of Mona, the main protagonist. It is high pitched and I can see how it could annoy folks but I thought it fit and didn't mind.Yes, the game ends on a cliffhanger and a sequel hasn't been made - yet, but don't let that put you off, the game that's here is still great. Plus, the creator, William Tiller, has been looking at creating a prequel and possibly a sequel though the initialKickstarter campaigndidn't pan out.I personally didn't have any problem running the game on Windows 8.1 64-bit. I also tried it on Windows 10 and in that case had to launch the game by clicking on the executable instead of through Steam.I think if you are a fan of classic point-and-click you'll like A Vampyre Story."

The game has many bugs that make it a headache. Whoever tries to, please install it under C: directory. Don't know if you have Steam under C: but the Steam client accepts to install a game in whatever drive you want. Feel free to give administrator permissions and I hope it plays because it may NOT...The graphics are good for an adventure game but I would like a widescreen but NO, there isn't. It has video cutscenes that make it good. It's all 3D and good looking.The story is black. The game is attractive but after a while playing it you'll feel that you think black,too. After all the game is for late teens and adults. It has many things in the dialogues and in view that newer eyes would be sensitive. The game is full of black humor but ... it has really many dialogues and so many black jokes that in many cases it will be tiresome. You're supposed to be a female vampire that NEVER accepted her later nature and tries to free herself from her master and his castle. The game was written by some makers of Monkey Island series but no way,it's not like them, One more thing you have to consider is that the second part of the game NEVER been made. So, don't search why the game ends this way, leaving many question marks behind.The sounds are pretty good. Black music and very good voices make the game excellent at this point.The riddles. You will be SO TIRED of them. Even the hardcore Adventurer will want to see a walkthrough. The game never stops having riddles. Riddles everywhere. And the possibilities are many. Because you have always to compare the new and the OLD and try them too. And it has many things in the environment that you will NEVER use. I was really tired of this game. And if it wasn't an OLD quality game I would place a negative review. I place a positive one for the game. As much for the controls, keep ""Tab"",""Space"", left and right click in mind.If you want to buy at your own risk and the game is playable under your system,if you can handle so many riddles in a very short space, if you like so many lines of dialogues and black humor then this game is for you.I would say that this is a Hardcore Adventure game with many bugs!"

The setting is nice and the background art is really well done. However, the 3D modeling could use some work as well as the animation. It isn't smooth, but if it were an old game, it would be forgiven. The voice acting and jokes are really good but it just takes up a lot of time within the game. You really should give the option of skipping dialogue, especially after we've heard it.As I said, it isn't the worst, but it's not the BEST. I was interested in the story and the art was really well done in the introduction. As for the gameplay, it could use some work revolving around typical point & click games. Let us skip dialogues, give us a button to access inventory, and make the characters move a little bit faster. With those alone, this game could be more tolerable."

There seems to be a pathing problem for most people so you have to download the game into a new steam folder with the shorter path or it won't start. Otherwise, the game works fine for me on Win7,64.A Vampyre story has good kind of cheesy jokes, creative puzzles, fun characters and very good voice acting.There are very few games in this genre where I actually listen to every single line of the dialogue. When you start randomly clicking just to hear a pun you know you have a good adventure game. It seems like no matter what you do it will trigger another joke.Main characters have something to say even about most useless combinations that make no sense. Like you can click ""Talk"" on any object that can't talk and you will hear a unique comment instead of -can't do.I love voice acting here except maybe for one person. Characters show emotional range instead of just reading their lines. It actually seems like they were having fun doing their job. Not sure why all of them need to sound like old school mafia but why not.The art style reminds me 90th animated cartoons and I am a huge sucker for those. There is a lot of nice perspective in scenery like flying above the place where you have been. The game is very colorful and has a lot of attention to detail. Places are fun to explore even if you get stuck.Puzzles were pretty hard but I would not say unfair. For the most part its the creativity of those puzzles that really slows you down. Gameplay is just a traditional point-click game but you can also use your flying friend to access places that you can't . So you have to keep in mind that you have 2 character and sometimes only one of them can pick something up .Also, you can press space to speed up walking or text. Very nice feature that some games do not have.The story is not complete. However, a good story leaves you wishing for more. I don't think it will happen but I would love to play another one.Score: 9/10I think the most important thing for a point&click game is fun writing. I wanted to listen to every single line of voice acting which is something that most games can't do to me. It has good characters, interesting puzzles, full voice acting and nostalgic animation. This was a perfect game for me. It is kinda old to pay $20 but I highly recommend it on sale if you like casual puzzle games with lots of jokes."

It also looks good, but the animations can sometimes 'stick' shall we say, although this is not a big issue.Any fans of P&C's will not be diasapointed in what this has to offer, although not the most challenging game out there, the puzzles aren't ludicrously obscure as they can be in some other titles and range from simple to medium difficulty.A couple of notes the game might need tweaking a little to run on newer systems but a quick search and you can find the simple information needed. Also I would add that you should try to 'Pick up', 'Talk to', etc every object as mentioned above the dialoug was for me the best part of the game. Lastly use the right click button when changing screens or rooms as Mona, your character, does walk slowly and using RC will skip the walking.Overall a enjoyable experience - 3.5 (bordering on 4 at times) out 5."

Being able to fast-forward scenes, dialogue and player movement via keyboard would have definitely won me over but my impatience got the better of me. Could have panned out better but i'm very disappointed :("

Something is wrong. And I really wanted to play this game. :(Update: Tried again with steam support person helping me. STILL doesn't work.Since it runs in the background it's over the time to get a refund as well.This is stupid. Fix your damn game.

The plot doesn't take itself very seriously at all and is filled with cheesy puns and references but still has a genuinely interesting cast of characters; Mona herself is charming with a ridiculous amount of denial about her vampiric nature, while Froderick has some very sarcastic lines that would often make me laugh. The animations can be a bit off at times but the designs have a lot of personality and the voice acting is really high quality. Like other point and click games some of the solutions to the puzzles are absolutely ridiculous, admittedly I did have to look up a walkthrough a couple of times, but they were still pretty fun and gave more opportunities for the fantastic dialogue to shine through. I've seen other people talking about issues with the game running, but apart from a weird instance where some of the cutscenes repeated themselves I didn't have any problems at all.Once I finished I looked up some information on the sequel and it doesn't look like we'll be seeing it any time soon, which does put a downer on the experience as it means that (spoiler) the story remains incomplete due to the cliffhanger ending. I would love to get a continuation to Mona's journey at some point, but I had fun with what we've been given and could see myself playing it again in the future. Overall I had a great time playing this game and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys point and click adventure games with a sense of humour."
