The bonus matches are always the same, regardless the stage or game mode- AI sometimes is insane and impossible to win. This should be fixed."

The controls are intuitive, the visuals are very impressive, and the new modes are very welcome. Only two real problems with this game, you have to tinker a bit with the graphics to get it to run smoothly, and two which is sorta minor is that they don't list the challenges for each particular match in the pause menu like they did in the original. This is really annoying when you forget them, but it's minor. I think the worst thing the developers could have done to this game is make it free-to-play. This invites the stereotypical freeloading gamers who think they're always entitled a completely free game and review the game negatively.  This is not how commerce works, so get over it! It's a great game for what it is, and ignore the majority of the negative reviews because they don't even bother to review the game itself."

I never got round to writing a review for it because it wasn't a GOTY or a flop. It was a niche game with quite a nice gameplay.Pool Nation FX takes Pool Nation and adds several bits to it which Pool Nation didn't have but could have done well with.Straight off the bat, a new game has been added: Snooker. The other game modes from Pool Nation are still in FX but so far I can't find 8 Ball UK (which is red and yellow and a 2 shots rule), but 8 Ball is merely cosmetic seeing as rules are now customisable.Menus are suspiciously like Codemaster's DiRT Rally but are more clear to navigate than Pool Nation's.FX is currenty in Early Access which may be a concerning factor, however this does mean that they can do some things which are a bit off. The contols aren't as smooth and nice to handle in Pool Nation (I'm surprised why they didn't copy and paste the controls). Vibration of controllers doesn't actually work. All the icons are for the Xbox One controller (even though both the Xbox 360 and Xbox One controllers are XInput as far as PC is concerned) meaning that users of the ""old"" Xbox 360 controllers might be confused.If you liked the first Pool Nation, FX is for you. If you thought the first Pool Nation was a little lacking, FX fills in the spaces. If you didn't play the first Pool Nation, take a look at FX if you're into Pool/Snooker."

In my Early Access review ofPool Nation FX I'll try to convince you that in thiscase the choice is easier like never before in thewhole Early Access games history.LOVE POOL...The pool love story all begun in the biblical Gardenof Eden where Adam and Eve were happily pottingunder a cherry tree very first balls. Yes, it was allabout cherries from the beginning. And then Godsaid: ""You can pot every ball except the apple-redone and you'll be enjoying the game of pool for thewhole eternity."". But as soon as God left, Eve lost byher own desires potted the THAT ball, just becauseit matched her lips (she was eating strawberries fora moment before). Since then we have to paymembership's fees in our pool clubs while welight-heartedly could play whenever we wish tounder every cherry tree in the world...LOVE POOL NATION...Released in 2013 first instalment of Pool Nationwas true revelation. After years of waiting since Iguess late '90 or even more ancient times of Ageof Amiga we finally got a true, uncompromisingpool simulator, Pool Nation. It was honest attemptbuild on real code-craftsmanship without any helpof big brands or names. Just a group of braveenthusiasts realising their bright vision. Theymanaged to achieve the impossible - combiningthe perfect gameplay experience with stunninggraphic. Since then Pool Nation maybe isn't onlypool game on Steam any more but still is leavingany competition far behind and now we even gotthe sequel, Pool Nation FX.One could wonder whether creating a sequel hasany sense or that the developers can make itsignificantly different to give Steamers owningPool Nation reason to buy Pool Nation FX. We allknow how it ends in other sport games franchises,year after year only few cosmetic changes, smallupdates here and there and here you go ""dear""gamer, a receipt for a ""new"" game.I must admit, I was really afraid. I'm with thisfranchise since the beginning and had a lot longhours of fun through last two years but it alsocreated even more expectation towardsPool Nation FX. What made the matter worse forme, it was Early Access. I simply don't buy ANYgames released in this way. But I've already seenwhat Cherry Pop team is capable of and had thatstrange feeling of the need to believe in them. Thefact that Pool Nation FX needs Early Access mostlyfor developing/adding even more features that italready has became the decisive break I neededto buy it.When I first time launched it I experiencedsomething truly wonderful. That evening I intendedonly to check it out, adjust some settings... but itwas impossible. For almost four hours I was fightingwith this game, it hugged me so strong and didn'twant to let me go:D. It was like a Christmas, thosevery first ones you remember from your childhood.Every piece of main menu was like yet anotherpresent box you were opening with blushes on yourface and there was so many of them!:).They really did it! Our beloved developers fromManchester made Pool Nation FX much, much morebetter simulator than ever has been seen and sinceit's Early Access it represents Cherry Pop'steaminvitation for full of attractions journeythrough Poolchester in luxurious VIP compartment.You might ask what they could possibly do more?What could be done more in game of balls and cues?The answer is: a lot. Of course I'll try not torob you now from the chance to experience as muchas possible of it for yourself - the preciousthing about new game.The Pool Nation FX's biggest asset is naturallybrand new game engine. Unreal Engine 4 makes allthe difference for game's mechanic and looks. Itwas brilliant move, perhaps even Top 10 of thebest decisions of Cherry Pop studio's history,one not far away from founding the company itself.Building such specialistic game type likesimulator requires solid grounds andUnreal Engine 4 provides them with no doubt.Picking new engine allowed not only fulfil allthe current ideas and gave balls more freedom butalso it left a window of opportunities opened forfuture development.When it comes to games with brilliant gameplay,especially the simulators, visuals really don'tmatter. But... how possibly one could skip it in caseof Pool Nation FX? You remember like I was writingthat Cherry Pop achieved something impossible(ok, at least almost impossible;)? Normally itends in making a harm to gameplay or visuals, veryrarely those two ""elements"" are mixed in evenproportions. The certainly impossible part is thatPool Nation FX is made in a way of classic,perfectionist, oldschool times. Pool Nation FXsimply looks so lovely! Realistic balls,magnificent cloth (ah those charming zooms)...Just look at the screens or clips... You just haveto see it in action. Such fantastic masterpiecepainted with high quality textures bewitches withits very classy kind of beauty. It's hard tobelieve that all data files of this game weightsless than a half of the weight of files from thefirst Pool Nation (SDD enthusiasts standingovation for Cherry Pop please;), multi-TB HDDsowners please stop boo-ing;)) and we're getting agame so many times better than its predecessor,yay!:) And with all those crazy high resolutionsand no FPS lock there's so much place for even morevisual magic. There's quite a lot options too (instill increasing number), not only graphic ones butalso those such as FOV, Cue Distance, 2 camera types(manual and TV) etc..Of course Pool Nation FX isn't bug free, but hey it'sbarley a week in Early Access and honestly theretruly isn't nothing worth of mentioning. All modeslisted above on Steam Store page are working fineand eventually encountered bugs are just detailsand definitely not disturbing ones. PlusCherry Pop team is extremely devoted in making thissimulator better with every day.BE PART OF POOL NATION...I simply can't find a single reason to not to enjoythis title from the beginning of its existence. EarlyAccess games always are a certain risk, but you,dear fellow Steamer have to look at Pool Nation FXdifferently. By owning it now you not only will beable to enjoy highest class addiction but you'll alsobecome a part in history of this one and only, thebest pool simulator on this planet. There's otherthing too. Pool Nation FX needs you, yes you!:), meand many others to become the ultimate solution forall our pool needs. Your input dear fellow Steameris so important because will help to make thissimulator our game. Everyone can leave in this pieceof code ones mark. Participation in Early Accessdoesn't reduce itself to reporting bugs.

(on 980GTX / 660GTX and 540M (Mobile)Controls:Controls are great. Reason for giving this a 9/10 is due to the 'console' generation of controls and GUI which could have been a lot easier to navigate through. Would still love to know how to access my 2 shot replays (lightening bolts) otherwise the rest of the controls are well documented.Audio:The audio quality is perfect but the reason for this being 4/10 is the limited midi instrumental soundtrack which gets a bit monotonous after a while and for me, personally, there is a female laugh which cycles every 10 seconds or so which also gets a bit grinding after while. These individual volumes are all adjustable and you can always run mediaplayer with your own beats.Gameplay:There is only so much the game of pool can really offer yet the developers have created heaps of different content from trickshots, multiplayer live matches to career mode. Personally, I will still play ocassionally with mates but doubt I would ever hit the 50 hour mark.Developer Commitment:To be honest, I have never seen a developer more involved in the 'Negative Review' community than Cherry Pop.This however can also be their biggest problem.X-Factor:Where to start...An over committed dev ('we listen to the community' style) has both positive and negative attributes.Making this a F2P game was a mistake. It just doesn't fit the model of a successful F2P game.Obviously this was adopted to increase the database of online players to counter-act complaints of 'servers are dead' by game purchasers. We all know that the development of a game costs ... yet for some reason its always the F2P that write all the negative reviews ... These should be labelled 'Demos'.Would I purchase at this very moment 13/01/2016?No probably not.If you take the dev/community out of the equation, I would definately buy this game again without hesitation.As of right now it seems the F2P version would be the better choice if you enjoy a casual game of pool.Seems like the developers are pretty much unlocking everything besides online play in F2P version.A positive is the fact that a F2P can access all the content when playing with a game purchaser.I'm interested to see what transpires here wrt dev vs community interaction."

Trying to just play a game with someone seems to take forever to try and organise.The control is what finally kills it for me.  You aim, and then switch to top view and then to ball view, and then try and set you spin etc and all this requires 3 to 4 different views.  It takes seemingly forever to set up any real shot, and even then the actual control is still very poor.The crunch is this game is a low end game design to suck thos micro and not so micro transactions out of you to enable you to actually play it.Give this game a miss!"

There's a short answer to that question: absolutely (with a few annotations regarding improvements).First of all, the game is not hard to play if anyone is worried about that, as the controls are quite simple, yet sufficient for cueing with more precision. Truly anyone can learn to play pool with this game. Secondly, the graphics are beautiful (if your pc can handle the game at the maximum settings of course, although the system requirements aren't really demanding). The locations in which you're able to play are stunning and decorated in great detail to fully immerse you into the setting. There are numerous cues, ball sets and even decals to choose from (if unlocked through playing the game), wich give you the ability to personalise your game. Great lighting effects and realistic sounds add even more to this emuneration.I need to mention, however, that there's still room for improvement. When the ball(s) have been cued the edges of the ball(s) seem to deform slightly when looked at from a (greater) distance. It may be due to anti-aliasing, I'm not sure about that. Besides, it would be great to have a few more camera angles to play with aside from the two that are currently available. The physics could be better as well, as it nearly seems as if the balls roll across a grass surface rather than a table. The balls seem to come to a halt too soon, but I might be wrong about that.My overall opinion about this game is very positive, especially when you take the fact into consideration that the game is still in the alpha stage. Keep up the good work and try to fix the bugs and alterations I mentioned before, please :)"

They have some sort of cash system that looks like it was thrown together overnight and can only buy things that were already included in my copy of the game. There is some single player mode which is very boring.

The good graphics is ok when you like it, but in reallife you will never see this kind of effects.Since the change of the pricing model you can play for free with the lite version, this is a good decision by the dev's.To unlock all areas of the game you can purchase some bundles or purchase the full version.When you will play a funny sports arcadish game with bad physics but good graphics then purchase this game.When you are a huge fan of Pool/Snooker and you LOVE simulate a real pool/snooker table on a PC then spend no Money for this game.

Some people wondered why the devs seemed to go silent, but its because they were too busy bringing their awesome game to Unreal Engine 4. The graphics are better, the physics are better, more game modes, including Snooker (Which I have no idea how to play but everyone has been asking for it).Being in early access, you can expect a few problems. I had a crash trying to play the daily challenge (and couldn't play again without using up prize money), and my time records in Endurance aren't being recorded. Also, Borderless Window doesn't center the game window on the screen, causing a bit of the game window to be cut off. But other than that, things are pretty smooth already.  It may be in early access but it is totally worth its price tag, especially if you own the original. Many of these issues have since been addressed, and so I highly reccomend it. There aren't many people playing online right now, but I find that really puzzling, because it's such a rock solid pool sim. It's the perfect game to pop on when you want to relax, and it's even a good pick if you don't have a lot of time, because most pool games don't take very long.P.S. Devs, please add an American English option. Some of the terminology in the text is a bit awkward to me"

If you liked Pool Nation, this is that, with a new engine, better graphics, new music, additional snooker mode *that I know we wanted in the original*.Some complain about day 1 DLC, usually I would agree, but this is pure cosmetic, and can be unlocked for IN GAME money. So if you really do not want to buy the DLC don't, I did and do not regret it, but as I said, it is unlockable.Some gripe that some features were promised in the original, I am not recalling that exact promise, but I know it was something to look for *in the future*, and here it is.I think a updated release is well justified here, and I am quick to burn Devs for re-releasing without real progress, but I think this is real progress.I *dispise* early access, and buy very few games that are early access. This game is a fully working game, with in progress development, and THAT is the right way to do early access, so Cherry Pop gets my money and approval.On top of all this, both Pool Nation and Pool Nation FX are quality products with value pricetags.

It obviously has some bugs that need to be worked out, but don't be too quick to judge it. It play it casually with my friends, I don't take it too seriously, and I have fun every time. I'm only writing this review because honestly, it needs some more positive ones. I was shocked when I looked into the negative reviews to find someone complaining that the game is ""pay to win"". That statement couldn't be farther from the truth in my opinion. The only thing you pay for in the game is customization (which there is a fantastic amount of), and it's all payed with using in game currency. Just off the top of my head, there's probably  6 or 7 different game modes which are all fun in their own way, with the classics like snooker, 8 ball, and 9 ball being my favourite. Having just partook in my first tournament after reaching 24 hours in game, and playing against certain friends, I can also say that there's a fantastic amount of variety in player skill that you can come across playing the game. Lastly, only being an occasional pool player IRL, I can't vouch for the physics, and I can't knit pick them and tell you how bad they are, because I honestly whouldn't know. (Oh, and the upcoming patches sound like they're going to improve the game even further, and make it even more enjoyable).So, if you're looking for a solid, rather customizable pool experience to casually play with some friends, and have a good time doing so, for a relatively fair price, pick the game up and give it a shot."

P.S. my only complaint is that when playing online there is a shot time period that doesnt give much time to figure out, and do what you want to do. maybe its different in some different game modes like league and torniment i dont know at this point, but just basic play online there is a ""shot time"". i assume they do this so people dont sit there forever doing whatever. but if they would just employ a system that allows you to "" contest "" a shot that is taking forever, meaning if the other person for whatever reason doesnt do anything for a time, then you can "" contest "" it and if the other person doesnt respond in a short period of time then you automatically win the game."

The draw strength seems very low, and needs boosting a bit to make it to feel better.This may be because of the leveling system with in the game. I have not played enough to use the higher cues. So maybe with experience points you get better realism. If this turns out to be the case, then this is a bit sad. In real life better cues do not hit harder, or change the way the balls hit each other. More expensive cues have better tips for more control. This should be what you get when you purchase a better cue in game.Lack of keybindings is a huge miss. I cannot adjust the butt angle because of my mouse driver not being recognised as middle mouse button. Yes I can change the mouse binding, but tbh, I will wait for a fix and play something else for now. Having played pool nation extensively, I know what to expect enough to not have to put the effort into it.Biggest negative I can see though is the view distance. Or rather big lack of it. The view distance needs to be increased massively. Having to use overhead view on distance shots just kills the realism in the game. Ideally set up a point of view key so you can offset what you are looking at, Just like you do in real life.Graphics support could use some tweaking. I was unable to set my native resolution 2560 X 1600. I ended up having to play in full screen, non windowed mode with 4k resolution. Which is not bad since pool games are not gpu intensive. I would rather play in my native resolution in windowed mode so I can view my second screen inbetween shots.Overall for an early access game,  a good experience. The fixes are minor programming wise, with the exception of a better viewing angle. The only real bugs I saw was the graphics detail set up.Looking foward to the full game in a more refined form."

Now that I have it, and have played it for a few hours, I highly recommend this game.  It's a beautiful game (no surprise there).  I love that they added people in the background milling around the venue while you play.  I had to chuckle that there is a TV going on in the background and they are showing Pool Nation on it.  The control scheme is smooth.  I also love the new tournament aspect.  In the original game, you had a string of players that you played through to make the title match of a tourney.  In FX, it's done in the fashion of a tournament tree, so you can see how the other players made it to that point.  I like that feel.  There isn't much else to say, really.  It's a pool game.  If you like pool games, then Pool Nation is one of the best that I have played.  They do it better than about anyone.  FX doesn't disappoint.  The price point is very reasonable, too.

A large portion of the background animations have been removed, which has greatly improved the game. The balls now move with great fluidity, without the need of reducing the quality of graphics to the point the balls started to look square. This has had a consequential effect on the AI, which no longer performs a rather obscure lining up ritual: aiming for the ball to be hit, veering wildly in another direction, wait for about 60-90 seconds, whereupon it would then realign with the original ball.I am disappointed though that all the cues, ball sets and decals have been unlocked, as it was fun trying to win the money to unlock them. Now there seems little point in winning money; unless there is some gambling possibility in multiplayer; I don't know because previously the game lagged so badly, I feared my latency would get my @ss kicked from Hawaii to Japan because of the embarrassing length of time it would take to make my shot.Thank you Cherry Pop 8)If the devs would only optimise this game so it didn't run like a sloth on mogadon, then it might be okay, but as it is, the completely pointless animations and graphics going on behind the table really slow the game down on higher settings; and even on lower settings there's no real fluidity to the ball physics.I really don't know why they put all that rubbish in. Pool Nation ran like a sloth on PCP, and was a dream to play. But this, as it stand, is really a poor successor."

Pool Nation FX introduces a more robust and challenging set of aiming mechanics, vastly improved graphics, and online competition.  It also features the triumphant return of Snooker, my personal favourite way to play pool.  Snooker has largely been ignored since the glory days of Virtual Snooker on Windows 95, and I'm glad Cherry Pop decided to feature it in this next installment.  I'm also glad to see some NPCs hanging around the venues to make things feel more realistic, instead of feeling like I'm stuck in someone's incomplete virtual reality program.  Still, they should be interacting more with the player.  I wouldn't mind some tournament backdrops with an audience.  Pool Nation FX sticks to the down and dirty basics of pool, but it needs some dynamic atmosphere to really make it come alive.  The music is better than the original, though nothing spectacular.  Who else wants a custom soundtrack option to be able to play pool with their own playlist?  Are you listening, Cherry Pop?In Early Access form, I feel that some things could be refined, most notably the mouse aiming.  It can feel a little sluggish when lining up a shot, and I wouldn't mind being able to scroll back a bit more for a better view.  Does it kill the gameplay for me?  Absolutely not.  But I think the original control scheme was far more swift.  There are a lot of modes to play, tournaments to enter, and online bouts to keep you entered for hours.  Pool Nation was a step in the right direction towards becoming the world's foremost billiards simulator.  I want to see Cherry Pop perfect the FX version even more than they have.  No resting on laurels!  This is too good a foundation to pass up."

Snooker is added, but the cue handling for a shot is still console ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Time to prepare a shot (for example jumpshot) in an online match is much too short, especially when you're new to the game - no chance.If you want to play a good billard game, get Virtual Pool 4 and forget this console/arcade game."

The only gripe I have for this game is that there's very few updates, I would love to see more updates coming out for this game to make it even better. The user interface on here is very slick. Only thing that's out of place is the chatbox, which I hope they fix to make it more in line with the rest of the gorgeous UI.Also please add the ability for customizing the HUD. I would love to have a feature where you can completely disable it all together to make the experience a bit more immersive.Would be cool if we can mod this game, such as adding in our own music, new locations and venues, new pool table skins, etc...Please continue to make this the best pool game out there! Amazing graphics!"

If you have ever played pool in real life just spare yourself the agony and buy a different game.1) you scratch on break: re-rack and computer breaks. Computer scratches on break: you get ball behind the line (you can still shoot at any ball on the table tho). You scratch at all during the match and CPU gets ball in hand anywhere on the table. CPU scratch you get ball behind the line.2) bottom english - straight shot; cue follows object ball into pocket (what in the illegitimate fxck?!). No matter what power your shot, if its a straight shot cue ball follows object ball. Its all messy.3) So limited on view options that it hurts. You can be right up on the cue ball or overhead view and everything else is a lie. When you are up on the cueball (view) the camera follows the stick when you change angles. You have an absolute shxt view of the table.4) CPU takes FOREVER to shoot. It acts confused moving left and right and finally shoots no matter if its a difficult shot or the object ball is sitting right in the fkn pocket. You can skip watching the shot by right clicking but thats equally annoying because there is no indication that you have skipped the shot til suddenly all the shxt on the table is just reconfigured and CPU is taking next shot. You basically end up mashing right click constantly until its your turn.5) Cant change the difficulty of the CPU in versus mode. Why? WTF Why?6) Good luck playing online. Either nobody is ever on there or its broken (maybe both).7) They call solids 'spots'. Hipsters?8) On easy have watched the CPU run the table off the break uncountable times. Hard to believe if you ever watch the CPU shoot it seems confused about what its even doing. Put it on medium and the CPU cant make more than 2 shots in a row.9) You can only set it to call the pocket on the 8 ball? Seriously? How bout every shot? CPU will slop shot you and its extremely annoying.10) You will get aids and so will your PC"
