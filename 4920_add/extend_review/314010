76561198008088676,Recommended,314010,14511061,"Posted: 16 February, 2015",all,Ether Bunny,"The early access bit:TL;DR - It's an excellent game, well worth the price of admission. Everything seems to work, and work well.This is a very simple to learn RTS, with good level design (thus far), a pretty good base mechanic, and a brilliant art style (literally and figuratively, the lighting is a bit intense).The basic premise is that you control a constantly-spawning highly mutable lifeform, and by taking and holding various points around the map you gain access to different sets of abilities for your units. Basic units spawn at a constant rate, and the biggest challenge lies in determining what to turn them into and where to attack. Resource management boils essentially down to ""how long do I wait before expanding"", which is a simple enough thing to measure.The good stuff:As I've said, the art design is excellent. Seriously, everything is pretty clear in its function at a glance and the game looks gorgeous.It's got a really intuitive interface. Even novice RTS players should be able to pick this up and figure out just about everything extremely easily.Speedy matches aren't something I'm used to in any RTS. It's nice to be able to knock out a quick game or two instead of an hours-long slog sometimes.It's quickly engaging, and the additional features that are supposed to make that even better.The downsides:If you're looking for something with a lot of depth, look elsewhere. There aren't lots of resources to juggle, there's no campaign, it is exactly what it appears to be.It's really heavy into micromanaging units for a sizeable portion of each game. Towards the end it can get a bit more macro, but misplacing half a dozen guys (not tough to do) can have pretty dire consequences early on.Momentum is massively important. This isn't a negative thing necessarily, but it becomes pretty clear pretty quickly who has the advantage in a battle. It's possible to come back if you're behind, but there's an obvious tipping point.You can't control units while you're zoomed out. That's a bit of an odd design decision and I'm sure there's a reason for it, but it's a little bit frustrating.All in all this is extremely well done, and for the price you seriously can't beat it for entertainment value."

The last release was May 18th.Update 03/06/16Around 6 months after my original review, and the game is still the same, no a thing has changed, haven't checked if the Devs had say something, but i suspecto they haven't.

,Recommended,314010,17241372,"Posted: 26 July, 2015",all,micbemac,"I have just spent several hours with Boid,  a simplistic 2D RTS that has you take control of several amoeba like organisms in underwater cavernous environments and pits you against an equal foe located on the other side of the map. Brought to us by indie developer tinyBuild Games, also known for the satrical ""No Time To Explain"".The idea is simple, take over all control points on the map before your opponent can. Control points are broken into two basic categories,  spawn points that slowly spawn new troops up to a maximum of five at a time, and evolution points which allow you to morph your creatures into various upgraded forms, like a strong crab like creature, a long range laser canon, and speedy scouts among other variations.  You are tasked with controlling your flow of new units while strategically choosing which path to take and which upgrades to use and balance everything accordingly. All actions are controlled by a simple click of the mouse, and a side panel gives you a brief summary of units available, and selected, and you can use waypoints to help automate some of your troops to specific defense points or upgrades to capture.Both offline and online modes are already included in the most recent build. The offline version features a fairly good A.I. which can challenge new comers to the game and is a good way of getting acquainted with most of the unit types, and general gameplay. Multiplayer of course is where a game like this shines, as adapting to a human player's differing strategies and changes of pace are where the real challenge and fun is. With the recent addition of leagues, and ranked play, you can easily lose hours to Boid.Graphically Boid's 2D graphics are simple, yet colourful and make it easy to identify unit types by their shape, as well as identify enemies. Winning and losing spawn points is shown graphically by quick flashes of light on the screen to give you a quick clue that you may need to investigate elsewhere. The submerged aquatic setting is full of life, and the lighting effects give great depth on what is otherwise a flat world.Available now on the Steam Early Access program at a measly $3.29 CAD, Boid is a steal for anyone looking for an easy to pick up, but competitive RTS. One that is being well supported by the developer with regular updates and improvements.www.micbemac.com"

It's too early to expect balanced gameplay but what's there is solid.

As soon as I understood what I was doing, matches were smooth, quick, and there were no futher problems. Got me really into strategy games. By far my favorite map is Venom valley, since it requires a lot more thinking. There's a good learning curve for anyone who is just starting on RTS games, and a challenge for anyone who already knows everything about these type of games.If you're going to buy it, consider getting the 4-pack and giving some copies to your friends. it will greatly improve your experience to play with friends than with bots.

You can choose any map including the ones you made, then AI will adapt to that map like other strategy game's AI do.Yet there's some problems including crashing issue, but still looks so fine for me as a game in developement. I'll be waiting for the next update.-------------------------------------------When you start the game, you're given one testicle which continuously produces sperm cells. You move them into other egg cells to dominate them. Once dominated, it also makes sperms for you. More testicles means more sperms.Once you reach enough amount of sperms, you finally march onto enemy egg cells to make them pregnant. Grab this game and make your baby!+Pros+Simple, noticeable graphic design.+Various mutation choice and many mutation spots around the map, which requires both strategy and tactics.+Short play time per a session.-Cons-There's no real egg cells to inject my REAL sperms.-Game shuts off occasionally, hope developers fix it soon.It's currently on early access but still very enjoyable.

And while it still looks good in it's way (kind of like neon sperm.... who doesn't like that?), it creates it's own set of problems:The minions move in swarms, which makes it difficult to distinguish between different classes of minions. Not that unit diversity is really noticeable anyway, but still....The way point ""dots"" can be difficult to click on and move for some reason.There is no way (that was made apparently by the tutorial at least) to hotkey select groups of minions... you can only select them by class, which makes directing your forces an exercise in frantic click-and-drag motions to separate and direct them accordingly.Add to these issues the fact that the AI is INSANELY fast and proficient in making an enormous force in about 10 seconds, while you're still desperately trying to drag the first way point to the predetermined spawn point.... the game becomes boring and repetitive very quickly."

Those spells are AoE and because your units move as swarm they can easily get frozen resulting in your army been wiped, just because you was not the first to rush this spell. Because of the nature of this spell ""INSTANT"", because of balance issues on all games in the world there is COOLDOWN or CHANNELING TIME. This is because this is game changing ability so the other player can respond to this high threat. Because of the nature of this game maybe you sacrifice units in order to cast this spell and the effect is based on how many units you sacrificed since you risk nothing casting it and you gain only benefits.Recommendations:*I can see you created waypoints for the spawners which is good for automation purposes, but make the spawner size smaller and the units to be unable to go on top of it that that much so players can more clearly know what they are doing.*While having spells is cool function adding channeling/recharge time is recommended. Other option is to make the effect based on how many units you sacrificed on the platform.Conclusion:*Because of the above problem I find this game to be unfit for play and I cannot recommend it until the above problem is fixed.*If they don't put some interesting campaign in this game and increase the size of the arenas I can't recommend this game for above 5€ as at the momment it have less content than a tetris and the size is the same as well."

Beyond that you can't control from maxized map, so the camp vision becomes really lame.Ninguém online para jogar qualquer partida online. As partidas de Bot são incrivelmentes difíceis e são injustas. Além de que você não pode jogar usando o mapa de forma ampliada, deixando o campo de visão muito pequeno e totalmente chato."

The devs seem to be doing a good job so far, the rest is up to you but id give it a 10/10 for the price."

Since there are three different difficulty settings for bots, you can freely experiment with lots of strategies before jumping online. I've just started playing and from what I can see, Boid has potential. I'm not good enough to jump online yet, but I will soon to at least test the waters. I believe TinyBuild is creating a rather unique game. I'm eager to see how it updates over the next few months."

Players can have lots of fun playing with a friend, as a early access game it have great and unqine game play. The different types of transformation made the game more competitive, taking key transformation point made matches between players more fun. There are also counters to different types of transformation making the game balance in many ways. There are different game play style with starcraft where you go rushing or play solid defense. The game developer also promise to make a system for player making their own map, letting player make crazy maps to play with friends. But there is one thing they are lack of, which is number player. As a early access game I understand lack of people is normal, but its hard to play online with low amount of players. MAYBE YOU CAN JOIN!"

While this does make it more interesting and fun (in my opinion) it can get really annoying to some people.Other than that, I feel this game was really well done."

,Recommended,314010,29747153,Posted: 6 February,all,Purple Guy,This is the best puzzle game in my mind what I have ever played my my life. The little green and red things reminds me of DNA what it would look like inside my or your body. It is very challenging when you try the DLC single player campaign. I am saving my money for another Steam card and I will spend it on the DLC of Boid because that is how much I love the game. If it is O.K. try on the next update to the game Boid if you can try and change the color of your team. Please try and put that on the next update. This is the best puzzle game I can ever play in my life.

I just reinstalled the game to play again and I’m very surprised by what the developer has added; last time I played they had added multiplayer, this time there is a single player campaign. The game is very well made, very nice clean and attractive graphics with fun gameplay. The developer has exceeded my expectations!It is a casual strategy game, great for casual play when you don’t feel like investing a lot of time into gaming. (My hours played is much higher than stated, probably from the restructuring)."
