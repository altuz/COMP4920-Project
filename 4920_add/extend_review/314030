Had a little trouble with it at first but now it runs great and my Xbox 1 controller works great on it! Highly recommend if your looking for a new fighting game, it has a cool style and awesome soundtrack.No online but I never really played online, theres a lot of content to keep you busy offline.Has Story Mode, Mission Mode, Arcade mode, M.O.M. mode, VS.

,Recommended,314030,14717460,"Posted: 1 March, 2015",all,RUNNING ★ WILD,"The Guilty Gear series has come a long way since it's humble beginnings on the original Playstation, up to it's high resolution upgrade X in arcades and on the Dreamcast, where the game really broke out and put itself on the map, especially when XX (Also known as X2) came along on the Playstation 2. Many iterations later, Slash, Accent Core, Accent Core Plus, Accent Core+R, Guilty Gear finally got a true sequel in the form of Guilty Gear Xrd.And yet, here I am still playing X2 #Reload. This game is by any means not even close to being balanced, nor as refined as later versions of X2, like say Slash or Accent Core, but I always keep coming back to it. I just like Guilty Gear back when it was a bit more simple, ya know? No Slash Backs, no Force Breaks, hell you can't even Throw Tech, no Blitz Shield, and no silly stuff like Danger Time and Hellfire. Just good ol' fashioned Guilty Gear with it's absurd gameplay, ridiculously awesome soundtrack and character designs, and thanks to this PC port, the first iteration of the series to have decent netplay, thanks to a fanmade patch.I would highly recommend this game if you consider yourself a fan of fighting games, I mean, you can't call yourself a fan of fighting games if you don't play a legendary series like Guilty Gear, and X2 #Reload was like the peak of the X2 series popularity. Even Daigo Umehara was playing X2 #Reload. You owe it to yourself to play this game. Sure it's outdated compared to Accent Core+R, but ya know, going back to the roots is always fun."

F12 made my game exit. That and no overlays worked for me (Steam or Afterburner).As with BlazBlue Calamity Trigger, you get a digital version of the OST (in mp3 form) found in the game folder."

Same with F12 - no screenshots till you change the button in Steam settings.This version CAN be patched to play online, however I am not sure how well it worksso try it yourself. Hopefully devs will move the patch into the main game so people won't have to do anything aside from clicking 'Install' on Steam.On the bright side - the soundtrack is shipped with the game and it is awesome (in the game folder).If you want to play online with fixes - just find the Japanese version on the internet and patch it. This one is not worth the money at the moment."

,Recommended,314030,16085581,"Posted: 30 May, 2015",all,Dr. Mircow,"Guilty Gear X2 #Reload (GGX2) is exactly how I remember playing it almost a decade ago - a very fast-paced 2D fighting game with a stunning soundtrack. That is because it is literally the same port which was released in 2004. Nothing was altered in this Steam version.Straightway, the first observation is that GGX2’s art style is anime. Actually, I lie. First observation is its blasting intro music which blew my mind back then, but I’ll discuss this later. Anyhow, I am not a fan of animes because a lot of themlook like♥♥♥♥♥♥/strike] simply do not appeal to me, but I can make a few exceptions and GGX2 is one of them. I suppose if you like animes then you will definitely find the art style appealing. But that is not to say I dislike some of its stage environments and character designs. This game does offer plenty of characters with distinctive abilities to choose from: Sol Badguy, I-No, Ky Kiske and Johnny are some of my favourites. Naturally, some are still pretty weird in a Japanese sense, but I came to expect this sort of stuff from Japan. To its credit, I still believe the art style in this game is unique compared to the mass of fighting games. While there’s a plot (through Story Mode) which is pretty mediocre and a bit absurd at times (typical of animes), I never really paid much attention to it; and that is because the game’s story is not its strongest aspect.The gameplay is where this game excels though, even if it is a bit outdated. It is rapid and the difficulty progresses with each new stage. Although it may seem pretty basic at first glance to anyone unfamiliar with fighting games or playing any GG game, GGX2 actually hides relatively intricate fighting mechanics beneath it, with various unique special attacks and “Overdrives” which are not that easy to master. More importantly, it is not a simple case of randomly mashing buttons, despite most people having a tendency of doing that when they initially play the game due to their unfamiliarity with the combos. It is a case where by the time the boss stage is reached, you really have to be on top of your game. So inevitably there will be lots of cursing (Hello. I-No!). The problem with this though is that you require patience and time to improve your skills and this may not suit everybody. To summarise the gameplay: easy to learn, hard to master.What distinguishes (any) Guilty Gear compared to other popular fighting games is its sonic, ear-shattering soundtrack. Oriented on hard rock and heavy metal (even a bit of jazz) with huge focus on guitars wailing in the background, you can trace all its influences from classic rock bands in the vein of Queen, Deep Purple, Genesis and Led Zeppelin, up to faster and more heavier sounding bands such as Iron Maiden, Metallica, and Dragonforce. Aside from its heavy sound, it is its progression and harmony in songs which were excellently executed by the artist -- not a single note misplaced -- making the overall soundtrack to stand out. All of that combined helps to produce the game’s unique energetic atmosphere. If you are the kind of person who has a passion for this kind of music, then GGX2’s soundtrack does not disappoint. Thankfully, by purchasing the Steam version you also get the entire soundtrack for free. Now go out, release the anger and let’s kick everything around, or how they say in the game: “Heaven or Hell! Let’s rock!”.On the other hand, considering that this port did not receive any sort of “remastering” treatment when it made its transition onto Steam, it has some glaring issues. The resolution is stuck at 640x480, so it looks pixelated and switching to Full Screen can cause some Direct3D errors. Sometimes Steam’s overlay is not always functional, thus it prevents you from taking any screenshots or browsing the Internet in-game. There is also a bug where the pointer keeps flashing on the screen when moving the mouse, causing further annoyance. Then you have the multiplayer which in its current state is simply broken. You need a specific fan-made patch to have access to a stable one. Frankly this is unacceptable from the developers considering the multiplayer is what kept/keeps (if patched) this game alive.Conclusively, GGX2 #Reload is a solid, yet a bit outdated, 2D fighting game with an excellent hard rock soundtrack and unique visuals, making it a must-play for anyone who likes challenging fighting games and has the patience to master its mechanics. While the game is very much playable despite being a weak port, I can only recommend this version for nostalgic purposes. Lastly, just remember to turn up the in-game volume to 11.Bridget is a guy. What the actual ♥♥♥♥!!"

I actually remember this game from old arcades and I'd say Guilty Gear X2 is one of the best of its examples. Flashy animations, original moves, tricky combinations, great character concepts and even including a storyline for each and every character, this game has always been one of my favorites of the genre. It's tricky to follow the storyline without some research though; my only regret about the series is that no one made an actual anime or OVA for it yet, so understading the references and character dialogues is a bit tough. Oh, whatever! Grab it, play it, abuse it, enjoy it! It's old school fun for a sunday afternoon."
,Recommended,314030,13063188,"Posted: 23 November, 2014",all,Malloc,"I spent a hideously massive amount of time with this game when it was released for the original Xbox way back in the day. It's lovely. It's also ten years old, and it shows.The quick and dirty tagline: If you purchase this on Steam, you are buying the 2004 PS2 console version of this game that automagically runs on your PC. Make no mistake though, this is the PS2 version. Nothing more, but also nothing less. That means no online play and even the button callouts are for a PS2 DualShock controller. Does that hurt the game? Honestly, not really. It was a great game then and it's great now, just don't go expecting much in the way of modern amenities. You're buying a classic.Let's get the cons out of the way right now:- No built-in online play. It's possible to use a third party program to do this, but it's not something that comes with the game. If your primary motivation for buying this is online matchmaking you very likely already know how to make this work, but if not, it's...a process, and it's not perfect.- The resolution's a tad funky. You're given a reasonable amount of settings options, but the fact of the matter is that you're basically running a standard-definition 4:3 aspect ratio game on a modern system that very likely has far surpassed those specifications. The game will technically run in fullscreen at 1080p and 60FPS, but there's going to be some pillarboxing involved, and (as with most games from this era that were console exclusive), there's some empty space at the top and bottom of the game as well. It's essentially a 4:3 square floating in the center of any given modern display. It's not awful, and it's certainly playable, but the game simply isn't going to make use of all your screen real estate.- Setting up the controls can be a bit of a pain. There's a handy program included with the game designed to do this, but it must be run outside of the game itself, after which you have to quit out and reboot the game proper. If you have  PC-compatible arcade stick, it's possible to map it to work with the (admittedly kinda weird) default arcade GGXX layout, but this will take a bit of patience. This can get doubly weird if you're like me and have an Xbox One controller plugged into the PC along with your stick; the game will assume the XInput controller is Player 1, and you have to manually remap the stick to be player 1 if that's what you want to use it for. It's not impossible or even particularly difficult, but it's quite a bit more involved than the usual in-game, press-this-button-to-map-it-to-this-move shennanigans.Let's go to the Pros:- This game's brilliant aesthetic style is peerless even relative to other games by the same company, and getting to play it in razor-sharp resolution brings out a lot of the astoundingly beautiful pixel art detail you never noticed on an old CRT screen. This is what high-budget, mega-creative fighting game character design looked like in the early aughts, long after SNK had dropped the ball but before Capcom had/has picked it back up again.- It runs great. Yes, it's a PS2 game port, yes tossing it in high res shows you that the much-vaunted ""high resolution"" sprites of the time...well, *weren't*, but you know what? You'll stop noticing the negatives about five seconds into actually playing the game. Outside of the odd screen size, the game runs absolutely perfectly. Everything is faithful, there's zero slowdown or other port-related weirdness, the controls are broken-glass sharp, and it's just an absolute blast to play.- There's quite a lot of content for single players. Even compared to modern fighting games like Street Fighter IV and King of Fighters XIII, there's a weirdly comprehensive story mode in GGX2#R that makes most everything else look weirdly anemic in comparison. Fully voiced (in Japanese) radio-drama style stories for every character in the game, a boatload of secrets, an art gallery, and tons of other goodies are all built into the game. The Steam version also comes with the full soundtrack in .mp3 format, which is a lovely touch.- The game itself holds up incredibly well. Guilty Gear was always something of an underdog series, but it has had (and continues to have) its die hard following for a very good reason: This game is fun as hell to play. Every character is entirely unique and they all have their own devoted mechanics to master, or work around if you're fighting them. Air dashing is a universal skill, one-hit-kill moves are possessed by every character without (somehow) making the game seem unbalanced, and everyone's got a giant mountain of personality to go along with their movesets. You've got a American playboy who fights with a cane sword, a pirate teenage girl who fights with an anchor bigger than she is, a witch rockstar who attacks you with her living hat, a corpse controlled by a liquid demon who can change shape at will, a 9' tall psychopath with a bag over his head who can teleport by opening doors in the background, and a bent-backwards down on his luck giggolo possessed by the ghost lady from The Ring (yes, really). That's just scraping the surface of this game's impressive roster. You will never be bored playing this, and the fact that the attention to detail runs so deep is just icing on the cake. None of the characters are throwaway gimmicks. Everyone has a personality, a story, a sometimes-incredibly-complicated moveset, and they all ooze style in a way few games can pull off.\- The rest of the package is what you'd expect. You've got training modes, Vs. modes, an Arcade mode, and a bunch of extras to poke around in. Again, if the idea of ""Play the PS2 version of the game on my PC"" sounds like a good deal to you, you'll get exactly what you were hoping for.At the price they're asking, this game is worth picking up. It wasn't terribly long ago that the idea of a semi-obscure japanese fighting game appearing on Steam seemed like something of a pipe dream, but here we are. With any luck, more will follow. In the meantime, if you're a fan you've probably already picked this up. If you're not a fan, though, this is a *great* place to start with these kinds of games. Highly recommended with some slight reservations regarding technical aspects."

Unfortunately, the netplay patch has problems with Xinput controllers since it's a really old patch, so be wary of that, but the vanilla game without the mod handles them well.Now this Terrible, Terrible Review might make it seem like I have a favorable bias towards fighting games, but that's because it's completely true, and this is one of the main games that caused it. Also, be sure to try out Guilty Gear Xrd, which is currently not (and probably never will be) on PC.~Til Next TimeSantana"
,Recommended,314030,13134751,"Posted: 28 November, 2014",all,Arcana,"The controls in this port might take a while to sort out if you are using a controller (it took like an hour for me to successfully figure out what action should be bound to which button), but once you get that down, this game will play just fine.My main gripe is not being able to change the character dialogue to English. I know that the English voice acting was never done so that is why everyone speaks in Japanese (minus the announcer who, oddly enough, only speaks inEnglish), but not being able to understand anything that any of the characters ever say does get rather frustrating after a while (especially since there are no English subtitles in the game to nullify this translation issue). That, and the sound of little Japanese girls constantly producing high-pitched anime-tier screams at the top of their lungs when both attacking or harmed (see: May) makes me want to deafen myself after like three seconds of hearing it.But that is probably just because I hate hearing children in general.I also do not like the one resolution in the game being a mere 640 x 480. That is far too small, so any Steam notification that shows up will cover up a huge chunk of the screen until the box goes away. That, and the in-game Steam Overlay is rather microscopic and unusable at such a small resolution, since everything is scaled to a size that looks best at the resolution that your computer is currently set to, leaving everything uncomfortably close and difficult to navigate unless your resolution is, for whatever reason, set to 640 x 480. Again, that might just be a personal problem, since I am too used to playing at a resolution size of 1280 x 720 or greater.Control setup issues, Japanese-only dialogue complaints and fixed resolution gripes aside, this is still a wonderful game all around. The various game modes, many character stories to play through and other included features give this game huge (if not infinite) replay value, depending on what your attention span is typically like. Once I relearn the controls, I am certain that I will end up getting lost in this game like I was back in my high school days (withGuilty Gear XX Λ Core Plusfor the PSP).Overall, I give this game an 8/10."

It is their First Series which also was the First Game for Designer/Composer Daisuke Ishiwatari.Its a 2D Beat em Up like Street Fighter, etc. but it is much different, since it uses a heavy reference on Rock/Metal Music (kinda like Brutal Legend).The Characters are awesome in their Ways. Here a short Description of them:-Sol Badguy: Arrogant Badass Bounty Hunter (and Scientist!). Listens to Queen and is a perfect Role Model for all Men. He uses a Rectangular Sword for more Coolness. Good Allaround Char for Beginners-Ky Kiske: A Zealous Priest(?) and seems to be an avid Fan of Metallica, since he listens all the Time ""Ride the Lightning"" during the Match. Can be pretty annoying, since he can spam Charged Edges all the Time which is also a Coward Way in my Opinion if overused. Also Beginner Char-Robo-Ky: Robot Copy of Ky Kiske with his own Moveset. Bonified Waifu Hunter. In this Installment he overheats slowly which is in his Favour (In Accent Core he was rebalanced to overheat more quickly) and has also quirky ""Gadget"" Moves-Bridget: !!!WARNING!!! Appearances may be deceiving-Johnny: Badass Pirate Swordsman. If Sol isnt cool enough for you, Johnny will gladly fill this Role. His Swordstyle is Japanese (Iaidō) and has very cool Moves, but requires Training and Tactic for his Mist Finer Moves-May: Member of Johnnys Pirate Crew. Has an Love Interest in Johnny but he has only Eyes for Mature Ladys. Has the most cutest and deadliest 6P in the Game-Slayer: Classic, Aristocratic and a Vampire. He is the very Definition of SWAG. He also has a immortal Wife (Blood Source for him) which follows him everywhere. High Damage Output and his Dash Teleport makes him unpredictable.-Baiken: Has only one Arm and Eye. Hides Traps in her Lost Arm. There is Questions if only there are Traps. She can counter Attacks while she is guarding so keep Attacks short to avoid it!-Anji Mito: Another Badass with Open Chest. Can be pretty annoying with his Dance Style, since its not possible to interrupt with single Strikes. He also can counter while attacking, so watch out-Chipp Zanuff: Ex-Drug Dealer/Junkie and now American Ninja. In this Installation he speaks random Japanese Words for his Attacks without knowing what they means. Bit Arrogant tough but due to his Drug abusing Past, he is somewhat idiotic and can be easily manipulated trough Words. Speed Char with lowest Defense-Venom: English Gentleman who plays Billard. Will take your Balls and play with his Killer customized Queue (No Pun intended). He is a very technical Character due to the Balls he summon, since they can be shoot in every possible Ways, which opens nearly infinite Tactics-Eddie: Eddie is the Monster (Forbidden Beast) and NOT the Human Character which is only a Corpse (Zato-1). Zato-1 has also a hypnotic♥♥♥♥♥which many couldn't get their Eyes off. In this Installment he is the Strongest Char-Millia Rage: Ex Lover of Zato-1. She has also a Forbidden Beast, but this Time in her Hairs. She sure has a lot of Costs to maintain those Hairs. She is a true Russian unlike Potemkin. Her ""Tandem Top"" Move is dangerous Oki Move, so watch out-Faust: The most Original Character (hence his Theme ""The Original"") in the Game. His Scalpel is also used in the Game for deep Probing (Medicine Use of Course). His Stance is crouched and hops all the Time like a Frog (Due to its Height of nearly 3m!)-Zappa: Poor Victim with bad Fashion Style from the 60s. His Charisma attracted a Ghost which haunts him all the Time and even taking Control of his Body which ends very painful after that. He is constantly searching for Faust for a Cure. Summons Ghosts to aiding him in Duels-Dizzy: Another Crew Member of Johnny. She is the Child of Justice (Half Gear tough). Kind, Sweet and Adorable (Watch out, she is only 3 Years old) but her Left Wing, Necro, doesnt like other Persons too close to her.-Axl Low: Another English Gentleman who is Lost in Time and only wants Chips and Fish back again in his Time (also his Girlfriend too). Has many Counter Moves which makes him dangerous to Attack and a Kusarigama for wide and safe Attacks. Can be played cowardly against Enemies, due to the Reach of his Kusarigama-Jam Kuradoberi: Only Girl in the Cast who is somewhat ""Normal"". She is also a good Cook which comes handy but is a cunning Saleswoman who likes to employ (or rather force them) without paying as much as possible. 3 of her Moves can be charged through Cards-Potemkin: Ex Slave who is in Military now. Juggernaut of the Series. Has Long Legs despite his Appearance, hence he fights some sorta like crouched all the Time like Faust. He is NOT a true Russian since he is born in Zepp. The Juggernaut Char-Testament: Human who was turned to Gear. He's like the Personification of Death and has a Crow Succubus(?) as Companion. Was before the Stepson of Kliff Undersn. Trap Char-I-No: ♥♥♥♥♥ of the Game who has Sadistic and Masochistic Tendencies. It must be fortunate to be her Guitar seeing how she treats it. She ""flies"" as her Dash-Kliff Undersn: Old Man with a Huge Toothpick for keeping the Kids away from his Lawn. Only Character who can damage using his Taunt (Rocks comes from his Mouth which falls to the Ground)-Justice: A Robolike Bioform with huge♥♥♥♥♥♥♥?). It's by the Way a Girl, so be Nice. Pretty Broken in this Installment, so watch out or avoid FightThe Rest is up to you now to discover their Personalities and Moves.There is also a Netplay Patch, so there is Online Functionality"

Which is weird. It's known for it's beautiful animation and unique characters, and is one of the more modern fighting games. Guilty Gear XX #Reload is essentially an add-on to Guilty Gear XX/X2. I was a big fan of the original X2, and it seems that all of the Guilty Gear fans play #Reload, even though it isn't out in America, save for on XBox. Well, I didn't have an Xbox, and I didn't plan on buying it, a new Guilty Gear, and a new controller (Xbox Controller? Ew.). So I looked for an alternative. Importing it for the Ps2 was out. So all that was left was the PC Version, which, I, er, just happened to get for free..somehow *wink*.GRAPHICS : 10/10In case you haven't been looking, Guilty Gear has some of the best 2-D graphics I've seen on the Ps2. The characters are high-resolution, the effects and animation are great, and..yeah. The graphics, like most 2D fighters today, are anime-ish. But yeah, the graphics are really great. The only thing I've seen outdo it is probably Street Fighter III: Third Strike, but it's still amazing. On the PC version, the sprites look a little less clean, and the character's eyes look weirder, but I think that's actually because I'm playing up near the screen, rather than a couple of feet away from it on my Ps2.STORY : 6/10Uhh..there's a story here, I just can't find it. I'm pretty sure the story is about giant robots or something..but even in story mode, I really can't find much. Here's a tip: If you've been playing 2D fighters for their awesome stories...you may want to stop.MUSIC : 7/10The music in Guilty Gear is all heavy metal. It's pretty good, I guess, but in reality, it matters if you like this sort of stuff--and I really don't. Even if I did, though, I can't imagine myself humming these tunes in my head like I do with Street Fighter II's themes. Well, at least it's not music that I actually mind listening to while beating people up. The sound quality on the PC version remains the same.CONTROL : 10/10The control in the game is really responsive, and this is definitely necessary, because it's really, really fast-paced, and you have to be able to pull off complex moves in a split second. With that said, don't expect to actually play this on a keyboard. You need a joypad, whether it be an arcade stick, a 360 controller, a SmartJoy--something.GAMEPLAY : 8/10Guilty Gear's gameplay isn't all that different from other 2D fighters, although there are some minor changes. In Guilty Gear, your characters walk really slowly, so you can double tap << to backflip/hop or >> to run. The jumping is really floaty compared to other fighters, you don't just jump and hit the ground, you take off and kind of hover before hitting the ground. Also, you can double jump--not something really common in fighters. Your super meter is called Tension, and you can do a lot of things with it besides doing super moves. You can do the faultless defense, which is just blocking, but instead of losing a little HP, you lose tension. There's also the roman cancel, which lets you cancel at any time in a combo, letting you start up a new one, but it costs half of your tension. Neat.The characters in Guilty Gear are pretty amazing. They range from a 9-foot dude with a scalpel to a a crazy posessed dude. All of them are pretty memorable, and that's important, because there are plenty of fighting games that have 40-something characters that are all look the same with slight differences, and nothing that stands out about them. Not only that, though, the characters all play differently. Even characters who appear the same do. Speaking of which, RELOAD adds one new character from X2.After playing the game for a solid amount of time, however, I am kind of disappointed. Not because of the lack of quality for the game, but that I kind of fell into the hype of people saying how great RELOAD was, when, in reality, it's a pretty minor upgrade. I've definetly noticed some minor changes, but they're just minor. I'm glad I didn't pay 60+ bucks to import this, because it'd be essentially buying the same game twice. It's pretty obvious why hardcore GG fans play Reload; because they're hardcore GG fans. They want the most balanced, fine-tuned version they can get. It's like playing Street Fighter 2: The Warrior Within when you could play Street Fighter 2: Champion Edition. They're pretty similar, but why not go with the one with the frills? What I'm saying is, if you're like me, and you had X2 for Ps2, you don't need to go crazy trying to find a method to play RELOAD..but other than that, this is a damn solid fighter. Invite some friends over and have a party.Anyway, the main changes about the PC version...there's no online play, first of all. Gotta go for the XBOX if you want that. Next, sometimes the loading times can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ When you start a round of Arcade Mode, the first person you fight will have like, a 10-15 second loading times. These loading times also happen in training mode. Other than that, it's pretty much the same game. Who coulda thunkit?OVERALL (NOT AN AVERAGE) : 8If you really must play Reload, try to, uh, er, ""find"" this game online. If you have an Xbox, and some cash, and you like Guilty Gear, you'll want to go with that version instead.Reviewer's Score: 8/10"

For those that have never played a GGX title (for shame!), this game has a really good free-flowing combo system combined with some really cool in-air mechanics, and the characters all have a cool hand-drawn-anime-type look. At $9.99 this is a steal."

This was the very first guilty gear game I've been able to play and it was an absolujte delight. All of the charaters pop with both their fighting styles/weapon choices and the wonderful japanese voice acting that I've come to enjoy through far to many subbed animes. Needless to say it's an otaku's wet dream.As far as acutal game play its quite a challenge, combat reminds me of the rotational systemthat I experienced in Persona 4 Arena, diffucult to master but oh so satisfying when mastered. I recommend a controller for this game as making rotations with the w,a,s,d keys is quite tricky. An amazing fighting game for lover's of the genre.10/10"

,Recommended,314030,12170462,"Posted: 20 September, 2014",all,D Money,"This may not be the most up to date Guilty Gear, but GGX2#Reload is a really good version and this port plays really well if you can't get Accent Core on the PS3 or Xbox 360, and dont' want to wait for Xrd Sign. The sound and visuals are perfect, the controls are good, Even though it doesn't appear to have xInput support, I was able to use LT/RT on my Xbox 360 MadCatz TE-S fightstick with no problem. Yes, you do need to install a mod to get netplay which I didn't do and can't comment on because I  just don't do netplay on fighters even though everyone else seems to. And as far as Guilty Gear X2 #Reload itself goes (assuming you've never played a game in the series,) it's a great fighter. it's fast paced, there's double-jumps, air-dashes, penalties for trying to turtle, and your super meter builds fast. It's designed to make short combos easy, and long combos doable. You will feel awesome when you play the game well, and it's definitely a must if you're even casually into fighters. Also if you're into instant-kill moves the game has those and you can do them any time in the match, but you basically announce to the whole world you're going for it and you handicap yourself severely if it whiffs."

Skull Girls is a spawn of it if you want to compair mechanics. The mutliplayer patch is a bit of a pain to get set up and hard to find ppl in your area but definently a great game and worth grabing. Would be better if they add'd mutiplayer without haveing to grab a secondary patch. Since fighting games are ment to be competitive...you just dont feel acomplished slaping around an npc...or at least i dont...but still grab this game if you love fast pace fighters and ones that arnt clunky like streetfighters or want an acual charter selection that your sure to find a char that you  can play comfortably...Jam and Chipp ftw : D

Gameplay is highly engaging, with good pace, an accessible control system and smooth rate of motion. The playable cast is a good size, and demonstrates a great deal of quirk and imagination from the designers. I particularly enjoyed the choice of modes available, as well as a standard arcade affair you can play through a scripted story route for each character, a survival mode, a coin-collecting mode called MOM, a mission mode where you can take on a series of preset conditions, among others.The AI is highly variable, mostly manageable according to your personal settings, however the last fight in Arcade mode against I-No can be, and often is, extremely trying, and may be off-putting for many players. By and large though, a strong single-player experience, though a venerable treat in the multiplayer stakes. Get yourself stuck in, I say!"

,Recommended,314030,13097749,"Posted: 26 November, 2014",all,✨Parado✨,"Let me start with the fact that I've been a Guilty Gear fan for just over a decade now, and I assume any fans of the series planning to buy this don't need much detail, and that newer fans might likely get it in an effort to get into the series before the release of Xrd on PS3/PS4 or just because they want a new fighter to play.The game itself is my personal favorite version of Guilty Gear X2. There are actually tons of versions of this game already, the original, #Reload, Slash, Accent Core, and a few others. While not the most balanced, this is still the best, and the closest to what Xrd's gameplay is like from my experience with an early build of it's console version.Since this is Guilty Gear, one of the big selling points is the soundtrack. Guilty Gear is full of references to rock and metal bands, and the soundtrack is amazingly original and just overall great.Now for story, X2 is the second GG entry to have a full story mode, with only GGX Plus before it. It follows a visual novel  form of story telling, which BlazBlue fans may be familiar with, where some dialouge choices here and there and loses/winning and how long it takes you to finish a fight can affect the story path. Plot wise, this game doesn't really have too much importance int he overall story of the series, but it does help develop each character. Every character has their own story, which is mostly unique, with a few crosses into the other character's stories here and there. One of the main themes of the series is ""Chaos"", and having a non linear story and no real overall story in this game really helps get that across.Controls are fairly easy to set up if you take your time to do so. I play with a PS3 controller with ""Better DS3 tool"", set to Direct Input mode. Just set up the controller in the config and everything should work fine.My only real problem with the Steam release of #Reload, is that before the game became available on Steam, it was on GOG, and the GOG version supported both PC and Mac, while this version only works on PC. I doubt that'll be a problem for most people, but it's just something I thought I should bring up.Overall, as a long time fan of Guilty Gear, I highly reccomend #Reload if you're trying to get into the series, or if you just need a new fighter with a wide variety of characters and play style."

This version is a little out dated, but for the asking price its worth trying out. It has a crazy cast of characters and a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome soundtrack plus some of the best gameplay that puts even newer fighting games to shame. If your not interested in fighting games, then stay away. This is a PC game from 2004 that (as I said) needs a fan patch and some fiddling to get online and do some other stuff. If you want to get into fighting games, and want a starting point I reccomend getting Skull girls or blazblue instead as they include indepth tutorials for newbies."

I haven't beat the whole story mode yet but out of the 3 fighters I used I was starting to see a pattern.

This is the game that set the standards for balance among tons of series and is referred to. There are no useless/joke characters, there are plenty that lend themselves to different gameplay preferences, and there are no real infitite loops or exploits thanks to easy to use mechanics like dust and faultless defense so newer players won't find themselves getting stuck and losing due to a hit making it through. Outside of that, the rest of what makes the series famous is here and holds true. Really cool 80's rock vibe for the soundtrack, and a cast of bizarre and over the top characters. That alone makes it worth it, so it's a double bonus that the gameplay matches up with how great everything else is. This is definitely a must have for a fighter's library.fyi this is a straight port of the xbox version, and a very good one at that."
