The video filter just makes things blurry, so you're best just leaving it off. You may want to set the scanlines to about 20 for that old CRT TV look and feel. If you were into the Double Dragon games back in the day, buy this. If you're too young to remember how awesome the Double Dragon games were back in the day, buy this. There's nothing better than seeing where some of the great games of today came from."

Play DD Neon. You'll get more fun out of that than this, seriously.First thing you'll notice when you start up the game is the interface. The menus look impeccable, and work nicely without many hiccups, although I did have to restart the game after changing resolution. (It crashed.)The second thing you'll notice is probably the music. For the record, Double Dragon's OST has some of my all-time favorite tunes. Unfortunately, the remixes don't quite live up to the originals. One such remix contains the groans and moans of the various characters... used as if they were instruments. Needless to say, I switched to 8-bit soon after, but even still, the music doesn't loop properly-- it fades out, then plays another song that wasn't connected to that level in the original version. It can, naturally, be very disconcerting.As for the HUD, the health bar is quite the looker, but the plain text for time and points in DD I and II you see in the screenshots... that's what you'll get in the game. It's ugly and doesn't fit with the rest of the game. Really, I wouldn't have minded using the original HUD at all, especially if they were not intending to ""finish"" the rest of it.Something that irks me as well... ""Story Mode"" isn't exactly a story mode as advertised. No cutscenes, no dialogue or the like. You kind of have to already know the story to understand what's going on, although fans of the series won't have an issue. Basically: ""Story Mode"" is a level select menu without continues after you lose your five lives, despite the fact ""Arcade Mode"" gives you infinite quarters.Few things to the game's credit: it does have a difficulty setting, and gamepad support works great. This will allow me to introduce Double Dragon to my friends without them becoming discouraged by the learning curve. The buttons were even mapped just about where I would want them automatically-- the jump button in between punch and kick, allowing for easy execution of the jump kick and elbow.If you can look past those things, the games are playable, and just as intense as they've ever been, but my grievances listed above really break the immersion and don't allow me to fully enjoy this game. If those things are fixed in a future update, I will happily recommend this game and rewrite my review."

Instead of using the score and time indicators of the original first two games, text is overlaid on the emulation and it doesn't really suit the games.There is a dearth of extras - arranged soundtracks are welcome, but they are implemented poorly; where is a sound test option, or artwork used to promote the games? No in-game manual? This is a bare bones release.""Story mode"" is just a level/mission select with no narrative, despite the name.  There are a number of filters, resolution and scanline options, which is welcome.  I have played a couple of games online.  The first seemed to be laggy for the host (or the host just didn't know how to play the game) whilst the second was fine.As for the games, Double Dragon is a classic beat-'em-up and still holds up today despite some annoying aspects.  The sequel is a remix of sorts and is playable and has some interesting ideas.  Double Dragon III is a jerky, terrible mess.  Whilst the initial characters are pleasingly acrobatic and have a wide range of moves, the game itself is mediocre and - in the arcade - the only way to unlock more characters and moves was to insert more coins.  This proto-DLC is still here, but you seem to be limited to just one ""coin"" so choose wisely.  This does mean that you will not get to play as all of the extra characters (I would love to be proved wrong here).To sum up, only buy if it is really cheap or you really, really want to play the games but bear in mind that the games have been tinkered with."

While Double Dragon Neon has a lot more gameplay and features better graphics, I believe $6 is a fair price to ask for what you're getting here.  I blew through DD1 on easy mode (there are three settings) in about 10-12 minutes.  Assuming the other two take just as long (on easy), you're looking at about 30-45 minutes of gameplay for your first playthru.  There's also a story mode in addition to an arcade mode, so there's more play time right there.  There's also the ability to continue where you left off when you run out of lives, which is (in my opinion) an added bonus.  All in all, this is an easy recommend for you retro-gamers out there.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKcSEUf6SxUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFTgZzyI1Pk"

At the time they were great games to play with friends for quick bursts of action. Here we basically have the best versions of these games with number 3 thrown in too. They have aged okay but don't expect anything earth shattering here. These are simple games from simpler times. There are some irratating traps that eat your lives near the end of the games. However, you can start each level with full lives once you reach them. There are weapons to pick up and it is quite fun to play alone or in co-op. If you had to choose I would recommend Double Dragon Neon more (basically the 4th in the series). However, if you are into retro games and nostalgia this is a nice set to purchase at a reasonable price. Just waiting for the Golden Axe games now..."

No unlimited continues for arcade mode was a horrible choice too.  Story mode is a different story and there shouldn't be unlimited continues.

His shadow move is hard to dodge, but not impossible.A couple of times I had to actually kill myself in game in order for the game to proceed.  Occasionally stairs wouldn't acknowledge I was even there and fell off to my death.  The game would often crash in local co-op and would have to exit to desktop and then enter back to fix the issue.

It's great having a compilation of the arcade versions of the Double Dragon games. I played the first DD arcade quite a bit when I was younger, and played DD II some in the arcade as well. Honestly, I am way more familiar with NES versions. I grew up on those games. I had all 3 mastered at one point. While there are some similarities, and some familiar locations, the arcade and NES version are very different from each other. The arcade versions are more straight forward beat-em-ups. They're all 3 similar to each other, but different enough it doesn't feel like playing the same game. I've only played single player so far, so I can't say yet on local co-op or online co-op, but so far I'm loving this game."

This game somewhat faithfully follows these ports but the original arcade GUI is missing from the original counterparts. Double Dragon 3 only gives you so many credits to spend in the weapon shop the first time around and every shop you go into the game from there on keeps saying insert the coin. If you have played the game Sonic CD on Steam you will know that this particular game was built from the ground up. This is the emulation that seems to take place in this game. Tile for Tile. Using the original sound track as digitized BGM (sound track) and not arcade native. I've seen that there have been updates to this collection to fix bugs, etc, but it's not enough to bring this collection at arcade perfection. A great game if you want to play 2 players locally on the same computer but I think this game is for die hard fans only as opposed to someone who is looking for something else to play. Grabbed this during the sale. Not a bad game but I feel kind of left hanging expecting more from this game."

Because of that it's extremely unforgiving - it was designed to drain kids' quarters with cheap and frequent deaths.  The controls are also clunky with a gamepad, plus I forgot how DD2 makes you kick behind you.

,Not Recommended,314150,30892627,Posted: 1 April,all,Marloo Redd,"The ports of the first two games are ok, though everything seems a lot smaller than I remember in the arcade, and not just because of the screen size.  The Rosetta Stone makes baby Jesus cry.  The game itself is just bad, but since this is intended to be a compilation, I can't hold that against this release.  What I can hold against it is how lazy the port seems to be.  Want to get power ups from the stores made to sell them?  Nope.  There's nothing equivalent to inserting quaters here.  Also, there seems to be some lag in leaving the stores.  That ""no inserting quarters equivalent"" holds all three games back, since these games were designed to be quarter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  It could be argued that it adds to the challenge, but it still would have been a nice option.I'd like to recommend this since the first two Double Dragon games are classics, and because they were actually intended to have serious stories.  Maybe there was supposed to be one in the third game too, but it's just so bad that it's goofy despite itself.  I can't, though, because of how lazy the port is.

,Not Recommended,314150,14112611,"Posted: 22 January, 2015",all,comboace,"Not an exact arcade emulation...These games are not ports of the original arcade games. They're recreated games using the sprites, backgrounds, and music ripped from the arcade game. If you have played the original arcade versions of these games you will know where all the enemies are placed, how many hits (elbows) it takes to take out the enemies, and also including button layouts.Double Dragon 2 is the prime example of exactly the reason these games are recreated and not even emulated. The control scheme for Double Dragon 2 is Left Attack, Jump, and Right Attack. On Double Dragon Trilogy there exactly like Double Dragon 1 control scheme (Punch, Jump, and Kick) only switching out the kick to always do a back kick no matter which side your facing instead of meaning if your facing right you would press the left attack to back kick and vice verse. Also they don't even have the original hud of the game and instead made a ""modern"" hud with a generic font.I guess for nostalgia purposes these games serve their purpose. and for $5.99 you do get pretty good recreated games (including the awful controls of Double Dragon 3). Also note that they have it set to a certain number of continues for each difficulty as well as how many lives you start of with. And they don't even show you how many credits you have either. So don't expect to be able to insert coins or even have infinite credits.Final verdict is if you like a classic beat-em-up style game then this game can satisfy for the price. But in all honesty nothing beats the original arecade games (although this does come kinda close)."

Fond memories of hours trying to rescue Billy and Jimmy's love interests. Especially with friends to play co-op. Unfortunately this failed to compete in my eyes. I feel like the hit detection is really off here. Maybe I've lost a step over the years but I remember going through multiple levels before losing a life and now I'm losing 2 or 3 in the first level. Plus I took an elbow to the face at one point with so much space between me and the enemy that it looked like a punch from a bad made for TV movie. I loved seeing it but sadly it did not live up to what I wanted from it. I guess I will be putting the NES cartridge back in and getting my Double Dragon fix without acheivements in the future. If you don't have access to the originals you might want to give it a try but for me it was just off.

The UI of the first two games has been replaced by an ugly version that I assume was designed for scalability on mobile phones and it looks terrible. The games are artificially sped up to compensate for the slowdown that was normal in the arcade versions and you can't toggle that off to play the original way. The original music is not emulated properly and the available re-mix music is awful and sounds like it was done on a mid-90s MIDI keyboard. They also removed any ability to coin up which breaks Double Dragon 3 as that game uses additional credits as a means to buy powerups.There are modern resolution options, local and online multiplayer (thoughno oneis playing this online and you can rebind all your controls, though the Xbox 360 controller buttons are not properly represented in-game.If you just want to play Double Dragon and aren't a retro enthusiast who wants the original games properly preserved, this is OK I guess. However, if you are someone who at least wants the original games as an option and thinks original preservation of retro titles is important, this is a poor choice and DotEmu should have done better."

Maybe its the way DotEmu are emulating the first two games where you only get one continue no matter what mode you play and can always hit the other player with you, or maybe the first two games were just garbage where enemeis can hit you and stunlock you the instant you get up. I think the nintendo versions are way more playable and reward skill, even if they put a level at the end that just steals your lives with platforming and traps.Double Dragon 3 is the only good one with cool moves you can do and where you can actually get a chance to hit things back, even if it was the birth of microtransactions, you didn't even really need them."

This is a side-scrolling beat-em-up in it's purest and simplest form.  You can punch, kick, jump, jump kick, and do a scant few other moves.  The enemies you'll face all have personality, but it's of the behavior-based variety.  The game is challenging, particularly on the Original and Expert difficulties, but can be finished in a short amount of time... even shorter if you become particularly skilled at the game and the nuances in it's play.Despite the inclusion of a ""Story"" mode, you're not getting a contemporary story here.  Double Dragon Trilogy hearkens back to a simpler time when games either didn't have a fleshed out story or if they did, it was typically comprised of a few static screens at the onset.  Back in 1987, Willy belting Marian in the gut and dragging her off into the unknown spoke volumes and provided all the inspiration needed to get her back.You're also not getting deep backstories to any of the characters... the protagnoist(s), enemies, or otherwise.  All of the characters in the game have distinct personalities certainly, but there won't be any flashy character introductions or drawn out narratives to tell you what they are.  Working with what little is there and utilizing some imagination would likely be your best bet.So with all of those limitations, why do I recommend this game?  As others have said, much of it is about nostalgia.  While I can certainly appreciate where the state of gaming is at today, I have an equally large appreciation for the games of my youth that effectively paved the way.  Double Dragon was not the first side-scrolling brawler, but it was the first to capture gamers imaginations in a way that it's predecessors and other titles of the era couldn't.  Whether it can still do that today depends on the individual.  In a generation rife with 1080p visuals, multi-channel surround sound, and multi-million dollar budgets, it's admittedly no easy task.Still, if you're looking for a game that can still retain it's charm despite almost 30 years of wear, Double Dragon Trilogy is it."

At $5.99, young gamers can also now experience the history of the virtual mean streets during the late 1980's. The old school can even meet the new school online for cooperative play. What else do you need?Not much. Double Dragon was never complicated- street punks kidnap girlfriend, must get girlfriend back. This simple premise was flawlessly presented with no dialogue at the start of the original in a matter of seconds. Azz-kicking ensues thereafter.There’s been plenty of sequels, remakes, and reworks over the years, and none of them were too shabby (save for the terrible one-on-one fighting entry that was Double Dragon V). With Trilogy, you should expect more arcade faithful versions of the original three, rather than the fondly remembered and popular NES ports. I’m sure we can all agree that Double Dragon II for NES is the superior version, but the original was a great game in its own right.The very best in the series, Double Dragon Advance, incorporated skills from previous entries like the headbutt, spinkick, hyper knee, mount, stomp, wall jump, grab, and parry to name a few. These powers complimented each other for a furious festival of flowing fists and feet. You won’t find such a diverse arsenal of moves in Trilogy- only the simplistic fighting styles that graced arcades back in the golden age.That being said, don't assume the most recently released homage, Double Dragon Neon, is the superlative entry. While it did wield an impressive move list and an insider's nostalgia, it never felt quite like a Technos game. For those looking for the genuine experience starring their beloved super-deformed characters and pick-up-and-play controls, Trilogy is the way to go, even if the platforming has aged beyond rationality by today's standards.http://zbronpsn.blogspot.com/2015/02/a-return-to-golden-age.html"

Big thanks for remastering the Double Dragon Arcade games of old, old school gamers like me grew up on these when they filled the arcade halls of late 80s and early 90s.The remake is very close to the original but there are a few things auido and graphic wise which are not identical to the original, I have this on MAME32 Emulator which is 100% identical for comparison.The 3 games are great fun and takes you back to in time, they also have the option to change resolution and music/audio track which gives a slightly different feeling whilst playing this old school beat em up.All in all if you played these back in the day then do yourself a favor and grab this and keep it for those rainy days or to show the youth of today what games were before it became a business industry focused on profiting from the very concept that my generation invented to escape the boredom of business and work."

This is a port of the arcade games. This review focuses more on the port than the games.Quick Anecdote: There's this thing called MAME, which stands for Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator. I played and beat the Double Dragon games on this MAME doohickey. Despite knowing this fact, when this trilogy port hit Steam I bought it immediately. I thought, ""Hey, maybe this port has some cool features and other settings like those boys at Iron Galaxy like to do with their arcade ports. Maybe it has cool cards that I can score a neat background/badge from.""Nope. You get a single video filter, ""On,"" which is French for ""Blurry,"" and three scanline settings: off, 50%, and 100%. The scanline effects are nice at least, though it'd be great if you could use a slider or it had more increments. There are some achievements and plenty of cards. Most of the cards, however, look like screenshots and cropped sprites ripped from said screenshotsWhat? No trademark laughably bad promotional art or marquee mockups at least? That's pretty much a Double Dragon staple.Oh and there are resolution settings too, but cough what kind of cough emulated port on pc cough past the year of 1999 coughwouldn'thave this option. cough. There's an option for arranged versions of BGM available as well, but to me, they're not as solid as the original songs and in no way possible could top Neon's arrangments.Hey, the menu's pretty nice to look at and the HUD is radical barring the Lucida SansTIMEfont, but that's just trivial. There's a difficulty select, which I assume is based on the dipswitch settings from the original arcade boards. At least they had the option. The Story Mode is just an overglorified level select. You have to beat the game on one continue and for each level you beat you can return to playing it in that level. I was expecting cutscenes or still images like the NES ports had, but I guess not.As for the multiplayer.. If you have a good connection with your partner, it's fine, but if you're like me, and your modem is a Texas Instruments calculator jury-rigged to a car battery and a mobile phone SIM chip, it's hard not to lag in games. From my experience, DD1 runs the best, DD2 doesn't lag that much, but DD3.. It's not as great. Couch co-op is fine but it seemed like the controls were even jumpier than usual.The controls are responsive, though a bit jumpy (with a gamepad at least). I'm not entirely sure, but a lot of other reviewers are mentioning that hit detection in this game is wonky and unlike the arcade versions, but I remember the arcade versions were kinda poppycock too at times. I CAN, however, tell you that there are frame drops in all games. Not always and completely noticeable in the first two games and DD3 had slowdown issues to begin with, but an FPS counter and/or v-sync option of some form would've been nice.To be fair, it doesn't seem like DotEmu churned this out for a quick cash grab, because it already has a patch. And I assume they're making or will make more patches in the future. That's always nice of a developer to do, at least. It shows that they pay attention.I rate this port a softcore 6/10.The games are goodand make up 5.9999 of the 6 points I gave it, but it's too bare-minimum and unrefined of a port to be giving it the time of day. Just go play it on MAME and wait until DotEmu (hopefully) polishes this jewel a bit, they're not even asking for much, too. And hey, if you feel bad about emulating these games, don't. The rights to Double Dragon games have been a mystery since the first game was made, and I'm sort of doubting DotEmu had the license to do this, so in a way, you're just about doing the same thing but paying for it.~ ""King"" Niddo D.

However, even I can admit that the original arcade games have not aged very well over the years. This collection only serves to prove that point. Compared to what is available today, the gameplay found in these classics has grown quite stale.As for the collection itself, DotEmu has done a serviceable job with the overall emulation. It's not perfect (some graphic overlays and music cues are missing), but it will do. However, other than featuring tracks from the remastered soundtracks that were released in the 80s (which are quite good), there are hardly any extras to speak of.If you are a super hardcore fan of the Double Dragon series that must own every release out there, then the $5 you'll spend here is worth it. Everyone else, however, would do better to spend their money elsewhere. I'd suggest tracking down a copy of Double Dragon Advance for the Game Boy Advance, as I feel that this game is the 'superlative' version of Double Dragon."

I have found this bundle to be very fun, and well worth the price.  There are no ""attract modes"" for any of the games, and I read that the attract mode actually tells the story in Double Dragon 3, so that's lost with this bundle.  However, Double Dragon 1 and 2 are still a ton of fun to play.  I would say Double Dragon 3 is not a very good game, but it was still worth a playthrough just to see where they went with the game.  Attempting the achievenents has been entertaining, as well.  The bundle includes the original music, or remixed music for each game.  I played through with each music setting, and enjoyed the similarity to the NES ports' music.  There are also several graphics settings, including scan lines or a smoothed out mode.Overall, I'm definitely happy with this purchase, and I think anyone looking for the original arcade Double Dragon games (not the NES versions) will have fun with this."

When double dragon was remastered for the xbox 360 with new graphics I was very dissappointed in that version for two reasons the first reason was they made Abobo look like a crack head or maybe he's just brain damaged in that version, I don't know. The second reason I was dissappointed in the xbox 360 version was the slow down issue wasn't resolved. I've played double dragon on mame32 and mame 32 plus and the slow down is there on those emulators. I was so happy with the slow down being fixed in this version that I had to write this review. I am thrilled that the slow down is finally gone and I can play this game without the slightest bit of annoyance. I bought this game only for the right to own the double dragon 2 rom and play it legally but I was so pleasantly surprised that slow down is no more in double dragon for this version which makes it the best version of double dragon to date, not to mention the music options. Another interesting change is the life bar has multiple layers. I couldn't be any happier with this game my dreams for double dragon with out slow down are fulfilled and more."

,Not Recommended,314150,34939525,Posted: 13 September,all,Gator MacReady,"Double Dragon WAS my 1988.I spent a lot of that year in arcades (back when they were operated with 10p coins) and played a LOT of button mashers and coin gobblers of the era. Double Dragon got most of my money and was the first side-scrolling beat-em-up I never played. The anime aesthetic and pumping soundtrack made it stand-out from the competition and the game went on to be a classic (thanks to many dodgy home console ports) with fans.This collection of the first three games might ruin the nostalgia for you. The legacy is not as spotless as you remember.Double Dragon (1987) 4/5As Billy and/or Jimmy Lee you battle through a post-apocalyptic city (with wildly different environments hilariously segueing into each other) to rescue your shared girlfriend Marion from gang (bang?) boss Big Willy. The usual hand and foot combos are aided by bats, barrels, whips, knives, and boulders. The game is fun until you reach the last stage and are actually murdered by the lancing statues and smashing stone beams.Double Dragon II (1988) 3/5I first came across this one in an arcade in the Florida Mall in summer 1989, six months after it debuted. I was beyond excited to see it but I didn't get very far, not only because I wasn't very good at video games back then but because the game is sadistically hard. As with the first you can just elbow smash your way through the entire game and this is actually recommended since if you attempt to punch and kick the enemy everything you do will be in vain as they lay waste to you non-stop. Collision detection is very poor and the level design is virtually a carbon copy of the first game. Still cannot finish it, even on easy mode.Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone (1990) 1/5An absolute abomination of a game and one of the most miserable gaming experiences I have ever had. If you thought that the  Mega Drive port was bad try playing the arcade original. It's utterly appalling and irreparably broken. Enter this game at your despair, I mean it!Sadly, this collection is a bust. It improves on the arcade in regards to the increased RAM, so there's no slow down when lots of characters are on screen but the controls are terrible with serious lag and sensitivity issues. You'll accidentally commit suicide many, many times and I once wasted six lives, count 'em...SIX, trying to get across that broken bridge in the first game. If you don't want to hurl your controller at the TV screen then I'd avoid it. The collection advertises the original soundtrack or a ""brand new, remastered one"" but it's not brand new. For the original game they've worked in the arranged soundtrack from the 1988 Japanese CD single, for Double Dragon II they've used tracks from the long out-of-print soundtrack CD but without the awesome ""Dead or Alive"" vocal track, and for Double Dragon 3 tracks from the old arranged CD are used. None of this music, or the remix of the theme tune on the title screen, have been made available for download, which is a shame since the CDs go for huge prices and a digital soundtrack release could have kept them contemporary. However, considering how popular these tunes are I'd expect a vinyl soundtrack release sometime in the future.There are 15 trophies/achievements with this Steam release (I only managed 10 as there is not a herd of wild horses on this Earth that can drag me back to Double Dragon 3) and 11 trading cards."

76561198372535646,Not Recommended,314150,35449192,Posted: 3 October,all,thingymedingy,"As a Double Dragon fan I have mixed emotions about writing this unfavourable review; I love the arcade game but don’t care much for this port.I'd also like to point out that I got this game in the Steam sale so I didn't pay full price of it, and I'm glad I didn't, here's why:I've been  a hugeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Double Dragon fan ever since I was a kid, I spent many an hour down my local arcade pumping serious coinage into my fav game. (Despite being able to beat it using one credit using the infamous elbow cheat, that’s because the wall section on the last level didn’t work for some reason lol).I purchased this game on different formats over the years; Commodore 64, Sega Megadrive (Genesis) - now whilst I enjoyed these versions they weren't exactly 'arcade perfect'.I missed out on the opportunity to buy it on the Xbox 360 arcade, shame really as that looked like a good port. (I won’t cover MAME emulation for legality).When I seen this on Steam my eyes literally lighted up, filled with tears of nostalgia. With it being on sale too it was a no brain-er!Blinded by my love for the game and ignoring the negative reviews I decided it buy it, a decision I immediately regretted – what is wrong with the audio?!The graphics and presentation are fine, gives you a few options to tinker with them which I like. Though the new health bars look ‘ok’, why wasn’t there an option to include the originals? The intro music as you start the game from the car garage is wrong (It uses the last level final boss music instead!). In other parts of the game it is also missing sound effects and music, for example the 2nd boss who comes up to fight you from an elevator.These could be perceived as small things to the average gamer, but on a game like Double Dragon with it’s loyal fan base these are big issues. I really did mar the enjoyment for me and subsequently I haven’t played it again (I haven’t bothered playing the other 2 games in the trilogy – the 2nd Game in the arcades was a bit meh, but still had some charm. I don’t even consider the 3rd instalment a DD game if I’m being honest).To summarise:If it was arcade perfect with a few extras throw in it would easily be worth the money (I’d even pay ‘double’ – pardon the pun), but this is but a pipe dream. If you’re the normal gamer and can get this cheap in the sale it ‘might’ be worth considering. True Double Dragon fans and anyone thinking it purchasing it full price then I personally wouldn’t bother."
