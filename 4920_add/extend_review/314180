,Recommended,314180,21756213,"Posted: 10 March, 2016",all,NeoStrayCat,"""Angels Smile in the face of Death""Well, Degica yet again brings you another CAVE game, that brought you guys Mushihimesama, here's Deathsmiles.Made in 07-08 within Arcades and then later on to X360 ports worldwide and into Mobile, Deathsmiles is one of CAVE's greatest Shmups ever made.The story is this...4 (or 5) Girls from various countires (Windia/Casper/Follett/Rosa), known as Angels by none other than the host of the manor they live in by Count Dior, have suddenly been transported to Gilverado, unbeknowning to them, they appear to understand and how its connected to their fates, they also appear to have ""Faimilars"" as well. Thus far, on All-Hallow's Eve, a man named Jitterbug appears in Hades Castle, summons a portal between Gilverado, and the real world and tries his way to get back into the real world, he also has a family with his Wife and his daughter, Sakura, the Witch of the Bog Wastes (Also a playable Angel), from where the portal appears, monsters and beasts have appeared all across Gilverado, and its up to the Angels to stop Jitterbug and turn everything back to normal, but not only that, a sinister being appears what stands between them and it, can they defeat it? Its up to you, the player to find out.Either way, the game's based more or less on the US/PAL 360 version (with less on the text accents) with all of the features so far and all modes pertaining to this release (Arcade/1.1/Normal/MBL/MBL 1.1/MBL Normal), Arcade and Normal modes are your default modes with its own scoring mechanic and difficulty selections in-game, while the 1.1 Arrange modes play slightly different, and requires a controller with the 2nd thumbstick to move your familiar to handle the suicide bullets easier. (Be reminded, there's no online co-op unlike the 360 version has.)PC Options will be there as usual to check within your own resolution and style. For bug problems and all that, as usual, refer to the forums for this game.Note: More on this review will be compared and fully complete as soon as I get enough time onto it. I recommend it, as would others that like the Shmup genre as well, thanks CAVE/Degica! X3"

While Deathsmiles is not their best and certainly one of the easiest danmaku games you can play, you gotta keep in mind that it was developed nearly 10 years ago and danmaku has come a long way since then.  Still, this is a highly enjoyable experience and the characters have a well-indicated hitbox so you'll know exactly where you need to be.If it wasn't good, I wouldn't have bought it twice."

76561198047468776,Recommended,314180,29928853,Posted: 14 February,all,Calamity Kitty,"This game took me back to the days I used to play in the arcades and waste all my money there attempting to get just a slightly better score than the one I already had. It exceeding my expectations considering all the recent bullet hell games I have gotten were ok, but a little underwhelming to say it nicely. This game delivered the bullet hell and I am a gothic lover and just the entire game has a gothic feel to it that is unique to bullet hells. This game rewarded me for buying it on sale for 8$ but I would pay the full price knowing how good it is now. It's become an instant favorite for me. You will die ALOT lol.The game mechanics are really unique, I play Mega Black Label mode the most as I find it the most fun, But the game has many unique game modes that don't ""Seem"" too different at a glance but you will find they are different enough to change the entire way you have to handle enemies. Positioning is much more important than in other bullet hells since certain modes make enemies explode into bullut hell bombs on top of enemies coming from both sides of the screen at the same time..and sometimes even from below or above.The bosses were quite difficult, I don't know about anyone else here but I absolutely hate it when a game is so difficult to get to the end boss and then you get to the end boss and you slaughter it and you're left feeling like it was pretty anti climactic. I didn't get that feeling at all from this game..It was a rough ride after the 1st few stages and one I thoroughly enjoyed. I plan to go back at some point and play it in 2 player local co-op again, I'll likely come back here and say more good things after that :3EDIT:After my 2 Player Co-Op of this game my view on it has not changed. This is probably one of, if not my absolute favorite bullet hell game.10/10 would buy at full price."
,Recommended,314180,22092386,"Posted: 27 March, 2016",all,Reverend Klaus,"I loved this game back when they released it for the Xbox 360, and I love it now. CAVE releases some of the best bullet hell shmups out there. Creative artwork, lots of great bullet patterns, and best of all they are really approachable.While your goal should be to avoid death and rack up the highest score possible, they are content to give you continues out the wazoo, so that you can experience the entire game no matter your skill level. This way, if you are new to games like this, you won't be put off by hitting a wall right away, and can still experience all the challenge and creative fun this game has to offer while you work on improving your skills.Between finding the best ways to maximize your points and use your familiars, this is the kind of game you can lose countless hours just trying to perfect. If you haven't liked shmups in the past, this MIGHT change your mind just due to its more forgiving nature. Of course, if you just don't like chasing high scores or the concept of shmups, this game probably isn't going to change your mind."
,Recommended,314180,22323698,"Posted: 9 April, 2016",all,somebody336,"Deathsmiles is a horizontal Bullet Hell centered around five girls and their fight against evil. Right off the bat you are given 6 modes to choose from which all feature subtle tweaks to the gameplay. Normal mode allows you to pick which ever difficulty you want and Arcade mode only allows you to pick the easier levels a few times before forcing you to up the challenge. “Ver.1.1” is definitely a mode you'd want to avoid picking the first time around as it only gives you one bomb per health bar and causes enemies to fire yellow projectiles once they are defeated far more often. Mega Black Edition adds an extra fifth character called Sakura to the fray as well as one new optional level and an new harder, more insane difficulty called “Level 999” that will test even the most hardened bullet hell player's skills.  It is quite an overwhelming number of modes to choose from the first time you play and they don't state what the differences are so I thought I'd dedicate a paragraph properly explaining them.After you choose your mode of choice, the game will start up in a rather small screen that you can tweak to your liking in the options menu as well as change the border art. Depending on the mode you choose you are able to choose from either 4 characters or 5. They all have the same speed and health though what really separates them is how they shoot their projectiles and their unique familiars that accompany them throughout. Sakura fires in a narrow spear like formation and has two crow familiars that take quite a bit of skill to use correctly but allows you to fire at any angle. Follet fires in a wide helix like formation and has a dragon familiar that rains fire in a short but devastating stream while Rosa has a single giant stream that sparks a few extra projectiles toward the end of it and has a fairy companion that can shoot through any objects which is insanely useful. The other two have their own quirks too and none of them feel better than the other which really helps fuel the need to discover the ins and outs of all the cast.One of Deathsmiles most unique features is the ability to choose in what order you take the first 6 missions on. You can play them in any order and if you are playing Arcade mode gives it a bit of strategy as it will not let you play all the levels on easy so choose wisely. After you finish the batch of 6 levels you are then given the option to head to either the last mission or the completely optional stage. Mega Black Label modes adds another optional level resulting in two optional stages if you are brave enough to face them. Those two optional levels do not have a difficulty mode you can set so these will be your demise if you are used to playing on easier difficulties. You don't receive anything for completing them other than a higher score at the end assuming you don't die so it may be best to skip them if you are attempting to run with no continues or a 1CC as Shmup fans call it. With 7 levels and two optional ones it will take you around 40 minutes to get through this.The gameplay has a rather neat feature in which you can shoot to the left with one button or to the right with another. I really liked this unique mechanic as it keeps you from remaining stationary on the edges of the screen like so many other bullet hells. In Deathsmiles sticking in the middle is your best bet as enemies will swarm you from both sides of the screen which feels absolutely awesome as you lay waste to your foes and feel like the anime version of Neo from the Matrix. Unlike most other games of this genre you will not die from a single hit, instead you have a life bar with three sections.  Taking a hit will cost you one section of the life bar while touching an enemy or a hazard will cost you half of a section. Losing an entire section will reset your bombs to max capacity though they do not stack so taking a hit while still having bombs left is incredibly wasteful. Bombs work like in any other game and they clear the screen of all projectiles and does heavy damage to your enemies.You can increase your life bar to allow you to take more hits if you do well enough though it is a very difficult task and using a continue will reset it back to normal. Holding both firing buttons at  the same time allows you to fire at any enemy in short range of your character which is less useful than simply firing in that direction. Where it becomes really useful is when facing bosses as getting in close and holding both buttons locks on to him meaning you can focus on just avoiding his attacks while doing consistent damage. As you defeat enemies they will drop items that both increase your score and fill up a number meter at the bottom left of the screen. Once you hit 500 or more in that meter and you press both attack buttons you will enter a “Power-up mode” where you cause more damage and receive much more points per kill.In “Ver.1.1” entering this power-up mode becomes much riskier as killing an enemy while it's in effect guarantees that it shoots projectiles once it dies and your attack becomes much more flashier making it hard to keep track of where the projectiles are. It is a risky gamble while on death's door and you are hoping the extra points you get from it will get you a health item or a bomb. Holding the attack button slows you down and deals more damage but the amount it slows you down is so minimal you are unlikely to notice. The amount of continues you can use is unlimited so any one can get to the end of this title.One minor annoyance that remains from Cave's last Steam release called Mushihimesama is the lack of one overall option for your screen settings. That means you will have to tweak your preferred screen settings on each of the 6 modes which is a very slight annoyance yet a remaining problem of their ports.Where Deathsmiles really messes up is on the story. It is pretty terrible and that is nothing new to the genre but there is too much of it here and no way to turn it off. It's pretty bothersome to mash a button to slightly speed up the cutscenes that were boring the first time around and it does reduce my will to keep on replaying it. Each character has slightly different things to say throughout the course of the game and each one also have one of two endings to choose from at the end. You know nothing about the characters which makes it hard to care but it's a cool feature nonetheless. A simple option to turn the story off would do wonders for those that have already seen all it has to offer or simply don't care. Graphics are do the job yet for some reason the characters are 3D models that have aged far worse than the 2D sprite work. The game also has objects like walls or cliffs that block you and forces you to make your way around it. I'm personally not a fan of stuff that impede your movement in bullet hell games but the real problem here is that you occasionally don't know if it's an actual object or just background scenery until you try flying through it. In a genre that requires split second timing second guessing yourself like this will likely spell your doom.Enemies in this game range from minotaurs, cyclops and even tanks. It is a very cool and whacky mix of both reality and fantasy. Each level has a boss at the end waiting for you and they all fight quite differently. Bosses are far odder than regular enemies and your jaw will likely drop when you see one of them is a giant cow. All in all Deathsmiles is a fun Bullet Hell that tries many different things and succeeds on most of them. While the story is a pain to read through having 5 characters, multiple routes and many modes to choose from is more than enough reason to replay this game time and time again. It's not the best the genre or Cave has to offer but it is a unique enough experience to warrant a buy from any fan of Bullet Hells."
,Recommended,314180,28460160,"Posted: 18 December, 2016",all,Celery,"Deathsmiles is one of the few horizontal shooters by CAVE.  Due to its unique nonlinear nature, it also happens to be one of their easier offerings, and therefore suitable for players new to the genre.  It debuted in Japanese arcades in 2007, and was later released on iOS, Android, and Xbox 360.  Thanks to Degica, it has now been released on PC as well.  The Steam release includes normal, arcade, and 1.1 versions of both the original and MBL (Mega Black Label).As the name suggests, the arcade versions have the same graphical appearance as the original arcade release.  I could be mistaken, but as far as I know, normal mode is exactly the same as arcade mode except it features upgraded graphics.  I purchased the game exclusively for the original versions of normal/arcade mode so I can't say I have the knowledge to speak at length about 1.1 or MBL.  From what I know, in 1.1 you have a greater degree of control over the character's familiar.  MBL is a different version of the game that features an additional playable character.  What I do know, however, is that some or all of the modes of MBL are either missing slowdown or don't have it at all.  If you're buying the game just to play anything other than the original version, I highly suggest exercising caution and doing some research.  That said, the remainder of this review will be about the normal original version of the game.Deathsmiles features four playable characters.  As usual, CAVE's focus was clearly on the gameplay and not on the story.  While the plot is minimalist at best, it does seem to have more of an involved story than the other two CAVE games currently available on Steam.  There is even a small amount of dialogue and two endings for each character.  Deathsmiles takes place in the magical land of Gilverado.  The characters are from real world countries but were transported there under mysterious circumstances.  The gist of the story is that someone opened a portal to the realm of demons and now Gilverado is being overrun, it is your job to save the day.Perhaps more so than in most other shooting games, saving the day is as easy or as hard as you make it.  Deathsmiles allows you to not only tackle the stages in nearly any order you wish, but also lets the player select an individual difficulty level for each stage.  If you consistently pick the highest difficulty level the game activates suicide bullets with death mode to further ramp up the difficulty.  If that's still not enough, you can choose an optional late game stage that is far more challenging than the other levels.  If the hardest path is not chosen, Deathsmiles is probably one of the easier CAVE STGs to 1cc.  One other difficulty factor is which character is chosen.Each of the four girls have different properties, the most obvious of which is the shot type.  Without going in depth, they all have familiars that function differently from each other.  The shot type strength and ease of familiar control makes some of them more friendly to new players than others.  For most Rosa will probably be the easiest and Casper the hardest.  They all have small heart shape hitboxes in the center of their bodies in addition to the ability to fire forward and backward, perform a special lockshot, and enter power-up mode after collecting a certain number of items.  Advanced scoring strategies involve clever uses of power-up mode.Admittedly, Deathsmiles isn't my favorite STG, but that's mostly due to personal preference rather than any inherent flaws with the game itself.  I haven't sunk as many hours into it as CAVE's other games, but I've had fun playing an odd credit here and there.  It's a solid shmup and yet another good title from CAVE.  I'd recommend this game to anyone that has enjoyed their other games, and is more interested in playing the original game than any of the MBL modes.  As of writing this, it has been nearly a year since release and unfortunately there is no sign of proper slowdown being implemented in the modes that are missing it.Edit: As I wrote previously, over time I've occasionally played a credit or two.  It's worth mention that I feel this game has grown on me. I've found the more I've played and learned the intricacies of its mechanics the more I've enjoyed it.Like the review?

This version also includes all of the updates and modes, including the Mega Black Lable DLC with Sakura as the 5th playable character and an extra additional level. Deathsmiles stands out as a Cave shmup title because they've committed to a horizontal side shooter which has been rarley seen with their titles. Each of the 5 playable characters have their own individual abilities with slightly different mechanices and their own familiars that also adds another layer to the gameplay can can be used in a number of situations.Pros:-4 Playable characters with different attributes with a 5th playable character in the included MBL-Decent amount of variety in its mechanices with the characters and their familiars-Non linear levels with various difficulty levels ( Levels 1, 2, 3 and the dreaded 999)-For the purist out there, the arcade modes is mostly faithful to the original arcade's resolution while Normal and 1.1 modes has a much cleaner, updated higher resolution for those who want their old school games to look their best-Some of the dialogue has been improved-Gothic lolitas!Cons:-Missing online co-op from the Xbox360 version, although there is local multiplayer-Found a minor bug where the game crashes when trying to switch from window to full screen. Luckily to fix this when the game does crash when switching to full screen, just restart the game and it will display on fullscreen.-This is considered one of the easier Cave titles to 1cc, which may turn off the most die-hard shmup fansVerdict: Thumbs up! Despite the minor bug and the missing online feature, Cave and Degica has done this game justice bring it out to steam and for the right price with everything featured. This is another sleeper hit I think gamers should look into and give this one a go. It may not be quite as intense as Mushihimesama but its just as enjoyable."

The goal of the game is to blow things up and go for the high score.Now your mileage on the game will depend on 1.

The gameplay is fantastic yet easy enough for someone who isn't great. I love the soundtrack. The different modes all offer something different and you'll find yourself going back to play more to improve your score or try different routes. If you do find yourself good at Schmups I think you'll find this is plenty challenging. At least I think so but I'm not the greatest at these types of games.

76561198068659415,Recommended,314180,21758770,"Posted: 10 March, 2016",all,Finally,"BewitchingDeathsmiles is a fascinating game that bridges two classic traditions of Japanese game design. It is, of course, a shooting game. But CAVE has chosen a curious theme for this game: horror. Often, shooting game themes are ornamental: despite how beautiful the graphics might be, the meat of a shooting game is in its mechanics. Post ""bullet hell"" this has never been more true, as graphics have been borderline abstracted to hitbox pixels and bright blue and pink bullet patterns. I have never minded this distillation of shooting mechanics in an era when, in most other genres, gameplay is often secondary to storyline and graphics. But it is from this understanding that the curiosity of Deathsmiles unfolds. Deathsmiles' horror influences go much deeper than the surface of the game and influence the very core of the game design.For me, the beauty of Deathsmiles lies in its homage to the horror-themed side scrollers of the 1980s. CAVE produced a horizontal shooter here, which is something of a rarity for a developer whose most significant contributions to the genre are of the more common vertical scrolling style. The scenario and soundtrack also stick out versus the rest of CAVE's shooting productions. Rather than more traditional military or alien settings, Deathsmiles uses a unique horror theme to derive its world and enemies. The scenario pairs with a brilliant soundtrack that fuses orchestral Hollywood monster composition with rock and electronic energy, filling the player with equal drive and dread. If the horror theme only got CAVE this far - a unique setting allowing for some fantastic looking enemies and a fun soundtrack - it would have already served them well. Instead, these elements all combine to create a game that is uniquely fascinating.This is a game by perhaps the most famous of all the shooting game developers. Yet, when I play it, I am transported back to the countless hours I've spent playing Castlevania and Makaimura. It is an experience that is at once nostalgic and new, and feels less like a shoot-em-up and more like Speed Ghouls 'n Ghosts. Upon starting a level, the player is presented with a world map, just like in Castlevania and Makaimura, and allowed to choose the location and difficulty of their next battle. A feeling of exploration - travelling around the world to slay a variety of evil monsters within a greater context - is created with this simple addition. The player character also does not die in one hit - rather, a Castlevania-style lifebar is used. The player character is still fragile, however - much more an Arthur than a Belmont. This serves to make the enemies more intimidating than a Castlevania ghoul ever was.Instead of enemies primarily coming from ahead of the player, as in traditional shooters, the Deathsmiles player is attacked from all four sides regularly. Two buttons are even dedicated to a left and right attack, affording the player many more movement and attack options than the typical modern shoot em up and drawing further similarities with side scrolling horror classics. Many modern shooters are about positioning to dodge, but Deathsmiles is about positioning to attack. To perhaps hammer home the influence of Castlevania, enemies may drop heart shaped items when defeated that can be used to perform a powerful secondary attack. These offensive tools are tactile and fun, and allow the player to feel less like a hitbox dodging hitboxes and more like a witch slaying giant monsters.Deathsmiles is, fittingly, a bewitching video game. Yes, it is a shooting game. But it is so much more. It takes the tendency of modern shooters to distill and refine their formulas to the purest form, and applies it to another classic genre: the arcade-style side scrolling horror adventure. It infuses a new energy into these classics that has not been felt in decades. It is a stunning look into an alternate future - a taste of what two of the most classic game genres could have become. It is, in my mind, a design masterpiece and one of CAVE's finest."

A little slow on initial load and I can't seem to get the keyboard working as a controller outside of the main menu (Controller / Joystick highly recommended anyway).All in all, fantastic game if you like the genre."

Unfortunately, I haven't put many hours into this version yet, so I can't speak on how stable it is. 40 minutes in, and didn't have any problems so I'm assuming it's better than the last port Degica pushed out.Now to the game it self. I absolutely love this game! I have put countless hours into the Xbox360 version and I plan on putting many more on the Steam version as well. As I said earlier; Deathsmiles was my very first CAVE game, and I had no idea what I was getting into once I got it. I came in with the intention of trying something new and I was blown away by how fun it was. It came around for me when every other genre of games was getting so boring, and to easy.With that being said, this game can be very hard and if you're looking for something with good story, you will not find that here. Obviously this is a Shoot 'Em Up, so you can pretty much clear each game mode within a couple of hours. That's not what this game is about though. It is very addictive, and can hold your attention for days and days if you're someone that likes to really push their self for hi-scores and 1CC.I know a lot of people with look at this game and be like, ""Oh another anime game on steam"" but, please don't let that fool you, it's very very fun and I really can't recommend this game anymore. If you like Shoot 'Em Ups or just ready to try something new, please get this game and support CAVE!"

I don't know. Anyways you gotta kill the monsters because they're monsters and you're a little girl mage; the natural predator of ogres, demons, goblins, and all other evil things. Luckily, none of the little girls are elf loli because then there might have been some trouble if there were orcs in the game.Well this is a review about the game not about what would happen if a hypothetical elf was put into the game. The bottom line is this SHMUP is just the way I like it. Little girls blowing crap up without some lame attempt at a story getting in the way. So I give this game 1 thumbs up since that's the only metric you can use in steam reviews apparently.It would be cool if we could give games 2 thumbs up if we really liked them. Like pro movie critics. I think this would give a lot of legitamacy to steam reviews if we could just get that extra thumbs up. PLEASE NOTE: I'm not saying I would give this game 2 thumbs up if I had the option and I'm not saying I'm not either. I would have to strongly consider the ramifications of giving this game 2 thumbs up before commiting to that level of review. I simply think it is wasteful to expend such considerable mental energy to decide on a matter that I can not employ. So until such a time as a second thumbs up button is added to steam reviews you will have to be satisfied with a single thumb up review."

As a SHMUP fan, I can say its money well spent. Not a huge bullet hell fan though, but at least there is unlimitted continues. Playing the game in arcade mode, the game looked bland, but the 1.1 in HD sure made a difference, there is also a BLACK LABEL mode that seems to just have more stuff onscreen, similar to Mushihimesama V1.5. I am only a casual player, not a 1CC type of guy, so the unlimitted continues really helped out. There are SHMUP's that I will never finish due to only having 3 credits. No its not a long game, but if want to get on the scoreboard be prepared to play it over and over. As far as SHMUP's go, I'd give it an 8/10.

I have beaten the game once with continues and have been trying too without for a little bit on the easiest setting, i'm relatively new to this genre and i still have a lot to learn, it's just if i have the motivation to learn it. The scoring system like all cave games takes a bit to get used too but it makes sense once you piece things together and the gameplay itself is a bit self explanatory, this gave has been very positive though i don't have much to say about the positives, it was more of an experience thing than something i can rather say.Onto the negatives though, there are few but it doesn't really prevent the game from being enjoyable, achievements don't unlock, i was sent a forum by the developers and tried stuff with default settings and multiple game modes but i haven't had any luck with it, and one day when i was opening it and even today when i launched the game and it launched fine but whenever i did go into stuff like Mega Black Label or just a normal game the game would crash, reinstalling the game fixed this issue, the hassle with bringing a console game to PC sometimes isn't very smooth but as far as i'm concerned most of the bugs with the pc port have been worked out these are 2 where 1 isn't effecting me now and 1 still is.Buy this one, well worth it.Edit: Default settings with achievements may have been the issue but i had no idea they were mode dependent because it never said so in the descriptions haha."

Easy to get into and incredible rewarding to master, especially some of those 1cc challenges. There is easily 200 hours worth of replayability here.But my problem have been there since launch. I get to the title screen and then the game crashes. Some say it is because people on the friend list with uncommon letters such as; æ, ø, å, ä, ö and so forth. But who knows what's causing the problem.There have been no official response or fix from neither Cave nor Degica. And with the release of DoDonPachi none of them seem to have any interest of fixing this issue...There is worth mentioning that there is a way around it. Starting the game while steam is in offline mode works, thus disabling the leaderboards. But this is an unnecessary step that should not be at the expense of the buyer.

And yes, you can shoot backward. Why? Because enemies might actually show up behind you. Don't worry. Enemy indicators are present to let you know an enemy is behind you.It looks simple at first, you shoot enemies on the front and on the back. But, the real eye examination begins when your enemies scatter bullets all over your screen and you have to dodge them all, or use a magic spell to eradicate the bullets (and enemies and certain destroyable objects). You have a tiny hitbox, so don't worry if your character might get a headshot. Worry about that hitbox where you'll actually take damage if a bullet strikes that hitbox!This means your eyes are concentrated on both the left and right side, and all the bullets on screen. Luckily, with the bullets, the game will lag for you just so you can read and analyse and plan an escape from the stream of bullets. This is probably the only time lag is your best friend, so don't blame your graphics card for not maintaining 60FPS.So, does this look easy? No. But you can still win this arcade game using a combination of good eyesight, quick response, and timing (for the magic spells). This, ladies and gentlemen, is pure bullet hell from famed bullet hell developer, Cave, and Deathsmiles proves to be very fun and challenging.All you need, is focus.Oh, and it also has amazing gothic art style and a rocking soundtrack.

And I guess a new boss if you are playing with Sakura.The graphics are not... good. But I don't mind they. It is a old game, to be honest, I find it a little charming. But that is probably nostalgia playing with me.Now, the Art direction is excellent! I love the gothic style Deathsmille has! I really like every character design, especially the bosses, Casper and Windia.The same can be said about it's soundtrack. The OST is very memorable and it will stuck in your head.I really like the gameplay system. Nothing much to say about it other than 'it is very fun to play'For it's full price, Deathsmilles suffers for its lack of in-game story, replay value and shortness.The music and art style begs for you to buy it, but please be wary of the things that I have mentioned.If you are going to play, be sure to check on the internet more about the story otherwise you will not know much about.I recommend getting this if you don't mind self-imposing a limit of continues to your plays or get Deathsmilles in a promo!Yet, a very enjoyable game.Have fun."

Well, it's a side-scrolling shooter. I'm biased, because I like my shmups vertical, but if this is your kind of game then this has to be one of the better ones. In my view it was a little slow going and there are a couple of gimmicky mechanics which the game could do without, but its still a solid bullet hell.

The soundtrack and animations are all top-notch, and combine in such a way that really makes me giddy.The pacing is nice and fast, without completely overwhelming you due to how well the art style makes everything stand out. It's surprisingly easy to tell what needs to be dodged and what doesn't, despite all the delightful visual chaos.On top of all of this, it's one of the few games that offers local co-op.  So you and a partner can actually sit on a couch together.  (Something that is sorely lacking in games these days, in my opinion.)  There's no online co-op, but speaking for myself, I was never a fan of that anyway.  For games like these, I prefer to be in the same room with someone.If I had two minor complaints, it would be these:1.  No widescreen support.  This is to be expected however, since it's a port of a Japanese arcade game.  The neat automatic background cycling makes up for this, though I wish there were more images available.  Definitely not a game breaker though.2.  No way to disable continues.  It's nice to have the option of infinite continues, since games like these can be very difficult depending on what you set it to.  But ""option"" is the key word here.  I wish there was a way to limit the number of ""coins"" you're given, or disable them entirely.  Achievements are based on getting through without them.  Again, this is minor, since you can obviously simply choose not to use them.All things considered, this game is a blast, and well worth the 50% sale at $10.  I probably wouldn't have gone any higher than $12 for an arcade shmup, so the default asking price of $20 is a bit steep in my opinion.

You take the role of one of five Angels to defend the magical land of Gilverado from an invasion by Hell itself!This one is your typical CAVE high quality shoot'em up. This Steam version has actually several versions of the game, the arcade one, the home console one, the 1.1 version with slightly changed enemies, and respective Mega Black Label (MBL) versions, with one added character, new difficulty level and some further modified enemies. The game itself is pretty short and can be finished in 30(ish) minutes, but that's per mode and per character, so the replayability is normal for these kind of shooter games.Mechanically it's a horizontal shooter, you can shoot left and right or bomb everything on the screen, after picking up enough enemy skulls pressing both shoot buttons together starts semi-invincibility mode where bullets still hurt you, but you can fly through enemies. There are three levels of difficulty, with the fourth one added in MBL version of the game. The first one is kinda normal shooter, the third one is kinda normal bullet-hell, the middle one is somewhat in-between. Shocker, I know. And the hardest lvl from MBL is just crazy. One thing I didn't like is that there are no weapon modifiers, so you have the same weapon start to finish. Each character has a different weapon at least, so it's not all that bad. The game is fun, as all CAVE shooters and if you like shooters you should give it a go.I liked:* another colorful CAVE shooter!* only shooter I know that has cow as a boss* also tyrannosatan, TYRANNOSATAN* several difficulty levels catering to different skill levelsI disliked:* no weapon upgrades throughout the gameGet this if:* you like horizontal shooters* you like anything by CAVE* you'd like an easy introduction to bullet hell games (lvl 1 is more of a standard shooter than bullet hell)Don't get this if:* you enjoy shooters for their story* you'd like cutting edge graphics* screen full of bullets seem scary to you"
