,Recommended,314200,11695850,"Posted: 13 August, 2014",all,shoggofu,"Okay so initially I was really unsure about this. I was tempted to give it a miss altogether. However I tried it out and ended up really enjoying it.- choices are a bit more broad than I expected, not only can you choose different dialogue options but you can also choose where to go to or to avoid certain locations- getting to an ending only takes around an hour, but surprisingly if you go back and take a different path a completely different kind of story can unfoldhttp://youtu.be/fRX6viF_SrIhttp://youtu.be/aTvH76MqHwsSo I actually achieved three different endings. First I gave the robot away to the police, that made the game end very early on, and it was kind of lame.-----But then I started again and avoided notifying the authorities. This time the story went for much longer. Choosing between your love for your girlfriend or the robot was a prominent theme. At the end of that play-through the bad guy was apprehended, the police conveniently let the robot go, nobodies heart was broken and everybody basically lived happily ever after. It was a bit too sweet for me (okay it gave me a nice warm feeling inside lol). This ending gave me new information about the mysterious robotic woman but only enough so that it actually created more unanswered questions.-----At this stage I had more time to play, so i went back again. I actually didn't really find more out about the robotic woman's background. In fact most of the main characters that took part in the story in my second play-through were put aside and didn't feature at all once I got to about mid-story. The game took place in a completely different location with a couple of new characters instead. There wasn't really any romance this time at all, it was more Sci-fi with a touch of horror. Some scenes were the same but it was overall quite a different experience.Obviously the game is very simply presented with still inanimate backgrounds and characters. But I liked how the game looked visually. The only problem I had with the game’s visuals was that occasionally you could see more of the character images than you should have. What I mean by this is that sometimes they are raised above the bottom of the screen and you can see that they are cut off where they should have legs. It wasn't a big deal but it was sort of an immersion breaker.-----All the dialogue is voice acted. I thought the protagonist’s dialogue was done adequately. Some of the characters spoke a bit slowly and monotonously. It seemed like they weren't as good, perhaps because it was the same voice actor attempting to create different sounding voices for a variety of character. That didn’t really matter though. I really liked the voice of the protagonist's girlfriend, she sounded really convincing when she was angry.Okay so I recommend trying this game out. There is actually a demo version. If you check out the community hub you will find information about acquiring that there. You might want to take a look at it before purchasing the full game. I found only three in endings in about two hours time. But the game allegedly has twenty-four alternate endings in total. Hopefully this means that for the $10 price there is enough unique content to satisfy people.Clickherefor my YouTube gaming channel"

At a certain point, I simply skipped all the previously read dialogue just  to get to the choices. All-in-all, it was a rather dull experience.The personalities of the characters are flat, and easily predictable. The plot was often cheesy, and sometimes the reactions of the characters made no sense. The 'relationship meter' of the character only influences the game in very rare instances. For example, if you get to certain points, characters you have a great relationship to will still betray you/treat you like dirt if the plot demands it. There's only seven plot-relevant characters, the rest of the world doesn't even feature.The sexual innuendo was especially painful. You are often forced to suffer through all sorts of sentences how 'hot and amazing' some girl's body is or our main hero commenting how he wants someone badly. it came across as a bit immature.The voicing was... alright. The female protagonist was voiced by someone with either a bad mic or its an intentional effect to make her sound inhuman. Some others just sound really bad. The music has really strange cues and often ruins the mood. Not to spoil the story, but a tense scene where some people are about to die is suddenly overlaid with 80s porn music because they confess their love to each other. It was like a fist to the nose, mood-wise.In the end, I didn't care for the characters, nor for the story. It was a bland, featureless experience. Alright to pass time, if you take it during a Sale, but don't expect to spend more than 6 hours on it.Winter Wolves has the tendency to spit out Visual Novels like mass produced, pre-packaged goods. Check out their other games, judge for yourselves. As someone who often played and enjoyed Visual novels, I can warn you that this one  is in the lower tier. Albeit I applaud the effort they made to voice the characters. That is about all that stands out positively. I was sadly fooled by the number of positive reviews in comparison to the bad ones."

It's fully voiced and if you don't like that you have the option to shut it off. You are given multi choices which in there own right feel reasonably different that leads to different endings. Some are good and some are bad. So it's not happily ever after with everything you do. Even if you don't want to find all the endings yourself Winter Wolves has a guide to help you in the forums. Really enjoy a lot of Winter Wolves games hope they keep coming out with them on Steam.
,Not Recommended,314200,14233633,"Posted: 29 January, 2015",all,celeste_ar,"I have mixed feelings about this one. I enjoyed my time with it, but i wouldn't exacltly go out of my way and recommend it to a friend.It is basicly an interactive b-movie. And the same reasoning applied to b-movies can be applied here as well. It lacks in many different areas, yet has a certain appeal and charm about it.The writing is decent enough to keep you hooked, the voice acting and dialogue ranges from acceptable to cringeworthy. The artstyle is either take it or leave it. And it is full of cheese and stereotypes.But at the same time you can see that the developers really cared about this novel, even though the end result turned out a bit amateurish, there's a lot to appreciate,Such as an unusually large amount of choices despite of being a visual novel. And a true branching storyline, almost at the level of the Stanley Parable.I bought it because i have an unhealthy obsession for cyberpunk, and i like eccentric budged titles too, So if you ask me, i would say i got my moneys worth.However, if you are looking for something of quality, or if you are new to visual novels, you might want to look elsewhere."

There’s more interaction between the characters on Bionic Heart than in other Winter Wolves games (at least the ones I’ve played so far), so that made me like this game. There’s a bit of status raising, which is okay because this time it was done in a good way: it’s not all about that, and you can see lots of events with the characters and get to know them better.The art style was decent, BG was good, BGM was decent. But… The VA wasterrible. I’m sorry, it was just REALLY BAD. I had to turn the voices off after 20 minutes of playthrough. There’s 24 different endings, so I think that the full price is fair. Even so, wait for a sale before getting this VN.6/10. It was an okay game, I loved the huge variety of endings. But the VA almost ruined the whole experience for me. =/Looking forward to play the next game!"

However, the basics of their future success are there. The premise here is dark. The world has succumbed to climate change... in a way unexpected by early 21st Century scientists. It now rains all the time... everywhere... which has got to make the cities a bit waterlogged... Especially a place like London, since if the polar caps have melted most of the modern city would be underwater...You, Luke, have suddenly had a strange android named Tanya enter your life... quite dangerously (we'll skip the one achievement where you don't meet her). Now, you have to figure out what to do with her... your relationship with Helen... and with your employer who happens to be doing... something beyond the pale.There are 24 endings, so take your time and find them all. If you can."
,Recommended,314200,26591089,"Posted: 13 November, 2016",all,Nyx,"I was pleasantly surprised by this game considering some of the complaints raised in other reviews. I give it a 7/10 officially but my enjoyment of it is closer to an 8. I'll give you my views on the cons, neutral points, and finally the pros. I'd say if you are not typically a fan of visual novels or you aren't sure, wait for this to go on sale as I did. You can then pay full price for its sequel, something I'm considering.[Cons]- There are some odd audio glitches at times when you skip to the next piece of dialogue.- Sometimes the voice acting audio sounds somewhat lower quality than the rest.- The character sprites don't necessarily move too much and the way they zoom in and out at times can be off-putting.- A couple of the voices are a bit on the weak side in terms of acting.- There weren't as many sound effects as I would have liked (definitely not a deal breaker).- Sometimes the speech sounds slightly unnatural, as if the writer is forgetting people don't talk like a book's narration.- Minor points on routes which don't make sense unless you've played other parts. Nothing serious, just throw-away comments and the like. I'm usually grouchy about that sort of issue but it didn't bother me here.[Neutral]- Some people may not enjoy the fact that the game can end quickly depending on certain choices. I disliked ""BAD END"" for a similar reason but that game didn't seem to give you the ability to avoid dying over and over again. I had an issue with ""The ORPHEUS Ruse"" yet that was more because the game not only required you to complete all the routes to understand anything, many of the routes made no sense. In ""Bionic Heart"", you can get enough out of one of the lengthier playthroughs and then come back--likely using skip--to see what else there is to the story.- My play-time will reflect some idling and a few frustrated attempts to follow the walkthrough. I've now seen all 24 endings and various different dialogue/choice reactions and I can say that, despite it being a little tricky for an impatient person without a clear guide, I enjoyed the various ways the game can branch. If you are the type to only play one route, you might miss a lot of what the game has to offer and not see how interesting a few of the characters are. So only purchase if you enjoy this amount of possibilities.- You never know what you (Luke Black) look like.[Pros]- Voice acting even for narration.- I personally enjoyed the art style of this game. Helen was especially cute, as was Julia.- The user interface was too bad at all and I enjoyed the extra functionality to this VN. Not the best out there but nothing to complain about for £6.99.- The story is interesting, I enjoy the setting, and it makes me want to find out more about 2099AD.- The variety of endings is rather refreshing to me, even the quick ends. It's nice to see effort put in. I actually did feel emotion towards the stories as I would expect from a decent book or film.- I didn't find the characters as flat as some people are making them out to be. If you play a few times, you'll see that, hopefully. Tom's a bit of a caricature but even he can have his depth.- Othello.[Conclusion:]You could do a lot worse. As I said, it may be best to wait for a sale but I generally say that about many games. Perhaps I'm cheap. There's a demo pinned in the Discussion Area so I suppose you could try that when considering full price. I really enjoyed myself tonight. This was an intriguing and satisfying way to relax, I actually cared about the characters."
,Recommended,314200,26109233,"Posted: 18 October, 2016",all,vap0rwaif,"This game is the platonic ideal of ""So Bad It's Good"" in 2016.The setting and backgrounds are lovingly crafted - atmospherically, this game is well crafted. The world-building is compelling and effective in a genuine way.The characters aren't so flat so much as they are each absurd caricatures and self-contradictory when it helps progress the plot. Somehow, this and certain animations definitely not functioning the way that they are supposed to work. The character writing feels like an 11 year old boy created an erotic sci-fi fantasy thriller with an every-man Gary Stu reacting to ~wacky situations~ but driven by his moral compass and trouser-snake. Again, somehow, it works, but only if you're willing to appreciate it on this level. If that's a thing you're into, this visual novel has absolute B-Movie charm and replay value. If you are looking for a narrative that you can take seriously, look a different place, but if you're looking for a well realized execution of bad fanfiction for boyz, this is really pretty great. There will be all of the manga breasts and lulz you can ask for."
,Not Recommended,314200,33321750,Posted: 6 July,all,~Lil RubyRose~,"Voice acting is terrible… characters, aside from the small few, sound almost lifeless, there’s no emphasis where there should be or emotion. The sound quality is scratchy; each recorded voice varies in quality. I find a number of lines to be overwritten, containing unnecessary information where it could have been worded differently or simply shortened to give a better meaning, and this is coming from someone who enjoys a good lengthy novel. It gives off the feel that characters are overplaying their part. Speaking of this, I disagree having the main character read out description and scenario lines like a narrator. Throughout the whole thing was off for me, as you can’t disable voice alone… so its either deal with this or play a silent game and lose the feel for it completely. The story is very slow to get into and various paths have you feeling like you're heading to one end anyway, I became more bored than intrigued within 5mins of playing and found myself ready to go play something else. I was highly intrigued by the story concept of this game but with so many elements lacking I simply cannot recommend it. This is honestly a terrible throw together of a VN. For someone who normally loves VNs and Futuristic Cyberpunk games, I thought this was a little gem, till I played it. Still if you can get it on sale it may be worth the purchase."

Voice acting can be pretty cringing at times, but pretty well done at times too.  The art style is similar to late 80's early 90's anime, and I dig that.  The sound track was enjoyable depending on the scene.  As for the story, there were a few parts and several of the endings that actually *did* have me feeling for the characters, so I'd call that a 'win'.Bottom line:  Buy it on sale or as part of a bundle, if you're into this sort of thing.  If you're not interested in the genre or setting, give it a pass."

Robot women will always be superior to actual women because you won't have to worry about divorce court laws, child support, and alimony payments.  With that being said, Bionic Heart is one of my few happy places on this green earth.I would say however, don't buy this game due to several factors that tarnish this games potential:One: the sound quality of the voice actors/actresses. You can tell from the crackling of the sound bits that they grabbed random people off the street and handed them a regular gaming headset and said ""Here ya go m8, read these lines.""Two:This game tries to pull off the typical NTR emotional knee jerk reaction from its players. It's decently executed, but still, NTR falls into the same category as respecting gender pronouns. It's a mental illness and a cancer to society.Three: The game is inclined torwards one ending despite how hard you fight to find the other endings, it kinda guides and coerces you to the same one unless you know all the plot turnpoints and what to pick for them.I'd rate this game an okayish 6/10, buy it if it goes on sale cause it's got an interesting story. Just play it on mute, anddisregard Helen because she's not best girl."

The ""in your face"" moments where too many as well (not only adult stuff) and I ended up not caring a tiny bit about anyone.

,Recommended,314200,14636585,"Posted: 24 February, 2015",all,Jelly Fox,"It took a little while to win me over, but midway through my first playthrough I found myself very much into the world Bionic Heart presents, wanting to know more. While most visual novels do have a tendency to focus on romance, this one is no different-- but at least it also has a strong action/mystery/science fiction story to go along with it.  The westernized art is well done. I also very much appreciate the fact there is voice acting for 100% of the dialogue. That is something that takes a lot of effort, even though it leaves me with one complaint: I do wish that they hadn't felt the need to voice-act the main protagonist's inner thoughts and feelings. During conversations and interactions with others, it's fine, but otherwise it sounds a bit awkward for the protag to literally be talking to himself. But, that's a very minor complaint everything considered.I also love just how many multiple endings (both good and bad) there are in this game, many of them vastly different from one another. It makes you feel like you are part of a futuristic Choose Your Own Adventure. Unlike some visual novels on steam, your choices are plentiful and have a direct impact on what going on and which direction the story takes; making it a highly interactive experience. With interesting characters, an evolving storyline with varying paths, and lots of replay value, this is a fantastic choice for those curious and/or apprehensive about the visual novel genre just as much as it is for those who already enjoy them."

Other games by this publisher are B-grade campy fun, but this one has the most juvenile, flat writing and a depressing tone that just makes one sad.  Also, a single run is extremely short.
