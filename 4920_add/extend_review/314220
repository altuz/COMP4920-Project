(1-5 players can play locally)and in case you don't know what Bomberman is. the game main objective is to kill your enemies with the blast from your bomb. the camera is as you see from the screenshots is top-down view, the maps has randomly generated blocks patterns. you start with a weak bomb and you use it to break the blocks and collect power-ups like (longer blast radius, ability to place more than 1 bomb at a time, ability to throw your bomb or push it...etc.if you have friends to play with then this game is a blast to play for sure."
,Recommended,314220,22542973,"Posted: 20 April, 2016",all,Silver Nova,"All right. Lets get the big thing out of the way. This game blatantly copies the Bomberman series. Like REALLY blatantly. Even the icon designs look like they were taken directly from the titles. As such, you'll be seeing a lot of comparisons between this game and that series in this review.The game is rather challenging and will be quick to ramp up the challenge from level to level, even early on. Unlike some games which will give you a small taste of a new trap or enemy before throwing them at you in full force, this game takes a trial by fire mentality. Those looking for a challenge will probably like what this game has to offer, just be prepared to adapt quick. Sadly, stages also tend to lack much variety from one another so the single player mode does get repetitive.Aesthetically the game doesn't quite have the charm of the series that inspired it. The music is all taken from public domain and mostly seems rather understated. One problem that arises from the aesthetics is the playable character's design. Due to his bulkiness, it becomes difficult to tell if he is safely hidden from an explosion or still in the line of fire. Multiple self destructs have resulted from me trying to determine the character's hitbox.Of course, given the inspiration, the game has a multiplayer battle mode. and if you liked it in Bomberman than you're in luck because it's literally an exact copy of everything from those games, from the level designs, to the power-ups to the stage gimmicks.Overall it's a decent game. Not as good as the series it's clearly trying to be, but given the state of the Bomberman franchise ever since Konami bought it, this is probably the closest to a sequel we're getting for a long while."

Had some initial control problems and wrote a review based on that - the developer added me as a friend on Steam and quickly solved the problem! I'm really impressed!Now that the problem is solved, I can easily say - AWESOME GAME!! If you grew up with Bomberman (or Dynablaster) like I did, then you will absolutely love this game. All the same frantic multiplayer you know and love, with a solid campaign too. Polished off with sweet artwork and some cool extras!Highly recommended."
,Not Recommended,314220,29058837,Posted: 6 January,all,Nertez,"Unfairly difficult (single player). I have no idea what the devs were thinking. I cannot even finish the 2nd world. Each NPC in the map will ""play"" like the most tactical p*ssy ever. The biggest design problem is that enemies literally STOP and basically camp and hide behind the cover. It's extremely difficult to kill them even if you have multiple remote-detonating bombs. Now THAT is messed up. They actively going around to get you and the power up too. It's like playing with 8 really good humans who you have to eliminate in 5 minutes. It's nearly impossible."

Get this game!This is a simple, well done tribute to the classic bomberman games.The 'story' mode in this game is challenging to say the least, enemies can avoid bombs, shoot you and break blocks to name a few. There are also environmental hazards to deal with to make things interesting. Both normal levels and bosses have had me rage quit because of how difficult it can be (I'm also terrible so it's not down to bad game design) but I was soon opening the game back up to try again.But for the reason I personally bought it for, multiplayer, it's a great game to just chill out to with a bunch of friends on skype or such like, trash talk them all before screwing up and trapping yourself with your own bomb, classic fun!If you want a low cost bomberman experience you can waste time on and/or play with friends, get this game, you can go one day without a Maccy meal."

There is also a single player adventure mode, where you blow up tricky monsters and bosses, which actually seems quite fun. There are various power ups to collect like the throwing glove etc. My favourite version of Bomberman was on the Sega Saturn and this isn't as good as that, but it is better than some of the Bombeman games out there and for a fair price."

This is a fine upgrade, It doesn't try anything radical new but there is no need to the old concept still works fine. Campaign mode is actually quiet hard and you really have to grind your teeth in this one. On the other hand skirmish AI is pretty dump though.  Mostly kills itself pretty quickly. For the price definitely a worth buy."

I have only played for 47 minutes and can't wait to see what other nasties i'll run into. Future add on to review if the game gets more challenging but hey they can only get faster.
76561198066339922,Recommended,314220,16480707,"Posted: 17 June, 2015",all,Joe Laanie,About 6 months ago I asked if this games is as good as Atomic Bomberman. It is NOT!I recently bought the game and after playing for a short while my conclusion is that it issorely lacking in gameplay. If the devs want some good ideas then they should check out Atomic Bomberman+ Single Play & bosses+ Nice Graphics+ Custom Keys- Detonation time too long- Glove should be an option. Not overiding the default placing of bombs (hold to throw)- Virtual AI bombermen would be a more fun challenge for single player (practice for MP)Still have to try Multiplayer when I have time...but will update my review

I do wish there was some sort of random online play though, maybe even with ranking, or unlocking skins, a function like that would make this game huge because there's skill involved.  VERY easy to get into, very hard to master.  Not to mention frantic fun!  That said, the online play is old school, have to set up server etc, too much of a hassle nowadays.  A quick ""online play"" function would rock!"

,Not Recommended,314220,22275112,"Posted: 6 April, 2016",all,Memleak,"I like especially the idea of having boss battles and some sense of progression. I would had liked that to be also in multiplayer.However, after you play a little you start to see behind it. It is just a badly made clone of the bomberman game. I would had prefered the squares graphics from bomberman than this new graphics which is quite clumsy. There are often situations where you don't realize if you are correctly placed, you might be 1px to the right and that's the end of it. Game effects that happen on the map and covers the screen (character, bombs, enemies) and the actual difficulty for bosses is mostly just being so OP.It's a nice game, I highly recommend to try it as a demo with the steam feature and if you like it go ahead and buy it. It iwll keep you busy some time. I don't recommend buying it for multiplayer at all."
