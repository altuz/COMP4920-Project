The problem is this is just another early access game that was rushed into full release too early. There are just too many bugs in the game right now to recommend this game as is.I will change my recommendation it a yes if the bugs get fixed.

Some of the buttons don't work, when you train your heros it tells you they have increased in the stat you trained in but doesn't alway increase the stat and after a couple of training sessions it seem to give you like 500% of your current stat so 100 strength becomes 500 strength in 1 go.

There are some games i would pay for any DLC monthly, forever. But only if the original game is DONE. Not the case here .. DO NOT waste any money and time for this ..."

Luckily the game saves constantly so I got back right where I left off.Unfortunately everything was pretty much bugged.-3 buildings were solid the rest were opaque. Toggling that option just switched the 3 solid back and forth.-Score was reset entirely for every kingdom.-All quick quests were locked agian except for 4 random ones.-Same with supplies for quick quests.-All progress on epic quest unlocks was reset.-Basically everything was completely ♥♥♥♥ed.Also if you do play make sure you wait for a hero to actually start doing what you set them to do. Some things will allow you to set multiple heroes to one building (Such as training strength). If you do this any hero who arrives after the first will be stuck doing that thing forever and you have to fire them and start over with a fresh hero.TL;DR Starts confusing, gets stupidly easy once you realize you can win the game by spamming shops everywhere, glitches out and you lose all progress."
,Recommended,314240,13829760,"Posted: 4 January, 2015",all,ratdog,"Before anything else, let me explain the game. You own a kingdom. Why? Who knows. You build stuff (taverns, shops, barracks, etc.) in a large-ish grid of grass and trees. You attract people into your kingdom, in hopes of them buying some stuff from your shops, like your average tycoon, although as of yet it is a very small focus. The big focus is on quests. You send your heroes on certain types of quests (rescue, vanquish, deliver, etc.) in certain other kingdoms. You allot some points to certain categories, and they're on their way. Thats pretty much it. Build more, quest more. Thats kind of all it is now. Now on with the rating. First of all, if I could rate this game N/A, I would. This game is simply unstable. There are many many bugs and imbalances. The developer himself said the game cost almost nothing to make, so I truly think the game would have been shed in a far better light if he waited to release it on early access. Although it is on the right track, its hard to recommend it as it is. Here is a pros and cons list, with that out of the way:Cons:UnbalancedBuggySensory-depriving color pallette, nothing but green and brown and gold highlights the whole game.Somewhat repetative quests, with sliders that seem to do nothing (unlike the ever-important sliders in GDT) EDIT: Sliders are now gone, and are replaced with... nothing? Now its worse than before, but not stealing something anymore.Slow progression, esp. in building.Once money (sorry, 'gold') goes below 0, its game over. No exceptions or anything, just a game over screen.Heros slowly die, with no apparent way to heal them. You even get a healing potion store, but not for them I guess. EDIT: This is aparently now fixedKlunky UI(keep in mind that almost all of these cons are things that can very easily be fixed by tweaking some numbers and code, so its up to the developer to make things right, for me atleast.)Pros:Interesting and unique graphics (though they could still use quite a bit of work)Despite monotony, still quite fun.Things to research,Shops to run,Not much else to say.I recommend this game because it is absolutely on the right track. If everything goes as it is, this game will be good. I can't disrecommend this game because of unforseen bugs and unbalances. While the developer should have released it a bit later, he very well might not have gotten any playtesters, therefore not being able to find any of those bugs or unbalances. The core game is fun, and thats all I'm looking for. So overall, I'm cutting this game some slack. I'll probably only play it briefly after the large updates every few weeks or so. The developer very honestly says he will work as hard as he can to finish this game, but anything can happen to one lone developer. A caring, involved developer like this is what this game needs to be fixed. I just hope he will. As of now, the current update, wait to buy, but you eventually should."

Quests give experience, both toward the heros that youve sent out, and your kingdom, that goes toward new building types, kingdom expansion and player stats, that affect your dice roll during quests.The gameplay is verymuch sandbox, but you can choose to undertake the general progression type quests, that give you money when youve completed a small list, which leads to another list, with more money.You can also start a custom game, where you can choose how much starting money you have, experience amounts given, etc etc...The devs are also happy to let people mod the game, and apparently its easily done... and, you can (if not a mod maker/coding expert like myself,) you have to ability to write your own quest stories and layout (not that ive done so, but still.) ...I've checked therough the files saved on the compueter however, and i can see that, the config files are also quite easily changed... so theres that too.EDIT: I have recently been in contact with a developer of this game, and they seemed very considerate and detailed within their responses. Good news.....Yes, there have been issues with bugs, but upon realising that after uninstalling the game, files were left behind, so i deleted them after searching 'my computer' and then using Ccleaner to scan and delete old files and registry files3- i re installed and the game is prettymuch working perfectly, dont be offput by negative reviews... its a one /two man team thatve been working on the game for a few years, and, through reading the replies from the devs toward bug reporting comments- the dev/s understand there are issues, and havent made any poor comments toward constructive criticism.be patient...it'll be worth it, im sure.I've rebuilt and started over too many times... its my own fault, i cant help it."

I bought it yesterday and it's honestly shaped up to be a pretty good game.Dont count this game out because of it's old reviews. I've had a blast playing it.I'll try to update my review once this gets updated or upon full release but as for now I wanted to add a positive review to the list.UPDATE 12/2/15I havent tried this game again in a good while. So far I can tell the game has had alot of explanations for things added. Such as skills on your heroes. I didnt know what they really did before (or if they even did anything back then) but now you can mouse over things to see what they do. I also enjoy being able to make multiples of certain buildings. Like needing to build houses for each of your heroes, rather than just having one house that you cram all of your heroes into. IM SO GLAD I CAN BUILD MULTIPLES OF THE SAME BUILDIGN NOW! Now I can make massive marketplaces rather than only being able to have one weapon shop! This is something I wanted REALLY bad before.This game keeps getting alot better as time goes on. Though I'm sad I lost my save from for freaking ever ago, there's alot of things that changed that I'd need to learn about by playing again. I'm a massive sucker for Town management games.

It feels like the playtesting was only done for the first hour of the game (i.e. the demo), at which point things start breaking down... guild quests that can't be completed, broken competition grounds, five people in a town with 20 stores, etc.  Even if you complete the game, good luck winning...  your 'opponents' grow exponentially, while your own earnings are capped.  Playing a full game isn't a testament of endurance, it's a mark of insanity.The biggest slap in the face is that there's DLC when the main game still needs so much work.  I don't know what the DLCs contain, but I can only assume that it's horse armor.  No horses.  Just the armor."

The few downsides right now would be that the game tends to just freeze up every now and then , and there's nothing you can do about it. So if you're going to play this save alot and be prepared to be a bit patient as you'll only have 1 hero for a good while and he gets fatigued at times. And the other minor gripes I do have would be with the way you set the sliders for your heroes on a quest. Things like Rush , Guard , Conflict sure you get the basic ideas but it's still very much vague , however the game is in early access and I'm hoping they'll make things like that a bit more accessible to people so they actually know what they're setting their sliders to and how it affects your hero on a quest.All in all , promising and excited to see more of it! And the price point is extremely fair too."

Stability is an issue even now, almost a year after Early Access opened. Funny thing is: stability has actually gotten worse2. The  UI is terrible. Confusing and counter-intuitive, you'll likely find yourself clicking around in menus trying to find things for several minutes3. The game is largely all dicerolls. Its unclear how to influence your odds4, Missions are arbitrary and pointless. There is no reason to read the text. It doesn't even tell a cohesive story5. Its not clear what the game is about. Is it about hero management or city building? And what's the deal with neighboring towns (some you're competing against, and some you're just visiting). It doesn't seem like the game-maker has a single vision for the game, but rather has a few visions for a few different games and kinda just taped them together.At the time of writing this, the game isn't worth your money (August 8, 2015).

With that said, the current state it is in I would not reccomend it quite yet to those looking to play a game with some rough edges. This game has more rough edges than a un-cut gemstone. Personnaly I love the concept of this game, but no matter what I do, I lose before I can really get started. The learning curve of this game, I would say, is much higher than need be. The fact that you start with random quests, but the same towns is also a large cause for many of my losses as I've started with three quests none of the towns have cared for, thus ensuing I would not have enough gold income to survive. I also understand that roads need to be maintained, but dirt roads, (in real life can be made by a single person walking the same path over the course of time that all they need to do is keep walking it to keep it in decent shape) costs a fair amount of gold to maintain. That simple fact confuses  deeply. If there isn't another type of road yet in the game, fair enough, but if there is (which I can't get far enough in to find out myself) then there is no reason Dirt roads should cost anything more than being built. Another problem I have is the Item system. My meele hero can have either a sword OR a sheild? and are there no class speific items such as wands only useable by spell casters (I.e. wizzards, mages, ect.)?In conclusion It's got a lot of rough edges, but I see that this game might just be a diamond in the rough at this stage. Reccomended for a easy to comprehend and play game for a good time? not yet. Reccomended for someone wanting to see a game as it developes and have fun learning the game and getting farther every update?

Feels like an alpha release.Litterally from 20-30 minutes of play.Possible improvements1. Music is very high pitched. Had to turn it off.2. When choosing quests, you can't go back to the original quest menue via a back button. So if you click a normal quest, you can't go to the original screen to choose between a normal/epic/history.3. Graphics are too simple... Needs more love/smoothed sides.4. Punished way too heavily for repeat quests. I understand if you repeat the same quest and it reduces a bit more every time, but to go from say 8 happy to 1 is a bit drastic.5. Purchases don't feel that fun. There's no sense of achievement when you add buildings.  Perhaps ability to upgrade buildings instead of just purchasing more?6. The people that come into the town don't have any character to them. They all seem bland and generic.7. Heroes should feel more personable...8. Combo history definately can be improved to be easier. Say automatically making items that don't work red. But I feel like this feature is kind of... pointless. Why do we even need to bring supplies? It punishes the player for not having unlocked the other stuff you need. I litterally only have 3/6 items I need as soon as I start the game, and that's just for the begining quest.9. I can't fully rotate the buildings. Only 2 face options.10. The heroes don't feel alive. Maybe they should express things when they are getting worse in mood?11. When the tutorial menu came on the right, i attempted to keep doing what I was doing. but couldn't. This might cause confusion for some people. Maybe semi graying out everything when it pops up so you can focus on the menu might be cool.12.

,Recommended,314240,21279099,"Posted: 17 February, 2016",all,Guybrush,"At first I was quite concerned with my purchase of this potential game, as time has progressed I have started to notice that among my other early access games with the exception of Gnomoria and Banished, this particular game has now grown to a state where I consider it worthy and playable for an extended amount of time. I particularly am impressed with the amount of new things a hero can do while another does the generic questing. The settlements have now become far more interactive, the shops serve more purpose than just money farming, and the inventory system now seems much more efficient at relating to the player what exactly they have and what it is good for. There are quite a few things left for me to really explore in this game, however it does seem familiar to another game by Kairosoft which I also loved called Dungeon Village, but even so this game is quickly surpassing that in terms of activities and gameplay especially the questing which allows you to choose your type of destiny instead of just accepting what there is already.for my obligatory rant however, I must say that the interface and specifically the ability to click on a specific object like a dirt road to delete resulted in my accidentally deleting an accessory shop, I would ask that with the opacity option maybe a more refined targetting with my cursor is desired. Also another petpeeve i've developed is with the arbitrary award system at the end of the year. In dungeon village the village and its heros in particular are awarded medals which are actual items that can be used to improve a hero's stats across the board. I'm not suggesting that exact thing but I would prefer something other than numbers and letters at the end of the year as this just does not add anything special to the game for me in particular. Lastly, and remember I have not played through the entire game since the last update but I feel as though the random events could be more than just global modifiers maybe something more interactive or under your control or the option to attempt to control the event would be preferable than just accepting the event as is. I suggest maybe also adding something similar to the dice roll system from epic quests allowing your heros to not only quest for settlements but to have the chance to maybe protect, improve, prevent, etc options for a global modifier event. If they fail the event is worse, if they succeed they improve the modifier, if they do nothing it remains the same as it currently is.Anyway I will be returning to play this after work, and the game as it has now become and currently is, worthy of purchase and worthy of your playtime. I don't know the developer or what he is working with but I saw a pile of crap spread on an empty canvas become a beautiful painting that still needs a slight touch up. Good work man and please continue to do your best and follow your own vision more so than the people who make suggestions because in the end they bought your game because of your decisions and visions and alot of developers seem to bow down to every crappy suggestion that sounds good on paper but damages the core gameplay that originally attracted that same person who made the suggestion to the game in the first place. tl;dr keep doing your own thing, but stay open minded to suggestions that may still be useful or an improvement to your vision.Edit: Forgot to mention, I love the settlement of Threepwood, I can't put my finger on why but it seems familiar and friendly to me."
76561198185539566,Recommended,314240,28439904,"Posted: 17 December, 2016",all,Tim Stryker,"Long Story Short Version:RPG Tycoon is a very promising, solid, good game at its core; with several unique & original twists & variations of the RPG, Simulation, Town Building/Management Genres, that are all nicely & effectively tied together & implemented, to make up an overall, fun & enjoyable gaming experience that youd hope for & want & expect from a game like this, that can keep you glued to it for hours at a time.  The game has come a long way since its early days, with continued support, updates & content added at a reasonable pace, with yet more work to be done & bugs that may or may not pop up along the way, but also with a diligent & friendly Dev that has stuck with it since the beginning & continues to update, modify & bug smash along the way & is routinely responsive & listens to his community.*End LSSV/lazy/ADD TLDR version.*In-Depth analysis of the game & the Developers performance to date:The foundation the Dev has laid down for this game has always been solid & the RPG, Simulation, Town-Building/Management aspects incorporated into this game has always had lots of potential from its early days & is mostly why Ive kept a good eye on it since then.  It looked promising enough back then but I was on the fence for several months, hesitant, mostly due to the critical reviews, while still checking back on it periodically.Eventually though, enough time went by & after keeping an active interest & a keen eye on it, & seeing continued progress, development & improvements & watching his YouTube vids, I felt like this was a guy that was truly into his work & committed to seeing it through.  So I finally decided to give in & I bought the game..played it & have had many hours of fun with it since then.Since then & along the way, many things have continued to be added, updated, improved upon & expanded; some things becoming bugged, some things unbugged; all at a consistently reasonable rate; all of which is the standard norm for Early Access games with a small team.  Its just himself & I think maybe he collaborates with 1 or 2 others.  Rinse, repeat; its an ongoing process, but one which the Dev has continued to see through on an acceptable basis.Aside from his normal To-Do list & agenda of updating & progressing the game over time in his own visions, hes also been receptive to the posts people have made with bugs/suggestions, etc; as evidenced by the past posts from myself & others here & the change-logs & resulting game-play changes that followed.At one point, due to having a vested interest in this game; since its something very different & so nicely encompasses so many cool & different traits from other games & genres that I really like & since Ive always really hoped to see this game in completion someday; in my haste, I hadnt seen any Account activity or Discussion Forum posts from the Dev in about a month & a half, so was worried that the Dev might have gone bye-bye as too many of them far too often do, with EA games these days...but he promptly & politely responded, simply pointing out he always keeps a watchful eye, just not always from the Dev Account, which actually makes sense in hindsight.On that note, occasionally there will be the random/rare person that posts bugs/suggestions or w/e & then a week or 2 or more goes by without a response from the Dev & that person becomes upset or says stuff like, ""Oh the Dev must not care"". etc;  Which to be fair to them, up to a point, thats understandable.  I even jumped the gun myself once.  Its not unusual...& in fact is sadly half expected anymore with EA games, for the Dev to bail on a game, or just not be at all involved with the community.  But I can personally & honestly state, thats just not the case here, to this date.  He is just one guy & has his own personal RL stuff going on, just like many of us do & works on this game in his free time, which all things considered, seems like he must generally make a point to set most of it aside, to attend to this game.Also, he does personally respond to posts, just not every single one & not all day, every day.  I personally can relate to that, as Ive got a super busy schedule myself, sometimes too busy & have to prioritize the stuff I want to do VS the stuff I need to do, & even stopping all that to do something simple, like respond to a text or email, can add more to my plate then I can already handle at that time.  I think a lot of Devs here on Steam fit into that category, as most of them arent full time programmers/game-designers & their game isnt their main source of income.  Some Devs dont bother to read &/or respond to their customers ever, but this Dev does fairly often.  And to me, as long as that level of customer service/interaction continues & the game keeps moving forward in a positive direction as its been; thats all that matters to me & all I care about, to warrant supporting this or any Dev, that demonstrates that on-going level of commitment.Bugs:The last time Id put any time into this game was appx 2-3 months ago ( from time of this review @ Dec 17th 2016 ) & had been wanting to play the game again after the last few updates/bug fixes & try out the new DLC.So recently I was able to play several hours off & on over the last week.  Started a new game, after buying the new DLC.  Everything was running smooth & working great at first, with a few minor bugs like; every time saving & quitting then reloading save game, the same few tutorial help boxes popped up, like if youre starting a new game.  Or while paused, clicking expand land, you hear the SFX of game like it was running even though visually, the game still appeared paused.  Nothing big or game breaking at all.Some more problematic things started to occur later on tho, like upon saving & reloading, most NPCs were unhappy & leaving, with no indication there was a prob prior to saving & quitting.  To be fair, Dev has a thread stating if you have probs be sure to erase that data which Im not sure I did this last replay.http://steamcommunity.com/app/314240/discussions/0/35221584437504412/Despite any bugs or probs along the way, I have faith in this Dev, from his past actions, not just words & promises like some Devs can do.  My honest opinion is, if you like what you see advertised here from the games Vids & Description, then you cant go wrong buying this game.  Its pretty much exactly/mostly what youd want & expect from a game like this.  Its not however a super duper in-depth game.  And its not meant to be & doesnt have to be to still be fun & enjoyable.  Nor is it on the shallow end either.  Overall its more of a mid-depth semi-casual gaming experience with several aspects that are still nicely in-depth, with other aspects to still keep you on your toes & wanting to continue to play, manage, grow & expand your kingdom.Bottom line is, this games been in development for a while now & continues to progress steadily, considering its from an Inde Dev.  Depending on the current state of the game & where its at, you may experience a relatively bug-free game, or you may be in the middle of a recent content update with the inevitable bugs that follow, which TBH, yes can get frustrating.  But thinking about it... Why does one get frustrated with something in the first place, instead of just not even caring or thinking twice about it & instead just walk away?  Cuz you care about it.  Cuz you like it.  Cuz theres some part of you that has a vested interest in that thing to begin with lol.Which is ultimately a testament & compliment to RPG Tycoon & what it does right & why its worth most peoples time even now, & especially once its 100% finished.  And which is why Im still glad I bought this game, even tho it has some polishing to do yet & hopefully a few more features/game-play additions.  I look forward to the future when well see this game in its fully realized, finished state.  ( :"

,Not Recommended,314240,11667918,"Posted: 11 August, 2014",all,Infern,"_______________18th March 2015 -The game has been updated quite abit. The mechanics are more smoothed out giving more of a flow instead of the janky feeling it had in the previous version.Okay the advantages compared to my last playthrough:-The GUI has been greatly improved as it flows.- More Buildings (which makes it feel more lively)- Research (makes the games last longer)- Ability to change the length of a gameThings I still agree needing improvement:- AI pathfinding (also no clipping with buildings)- Buildings need animations to make it feel alive instead of a static picture.- More people roaming the city (instead of 1 person on screen at a time. more)- Elevation and Trees in the terrain. (The game feels too empty without that)(Elevation would also allow you to make the game more challenging so you are limited with space)- Ability to rotate the camera with the Sprites rotating with it. (Optional but would make planning more efficient)- Ability to see other ""rival"" kingdoms (This will also allow you to show off your favourite cities in a new light)Though the game is in a better state than before and actually makes it more ""fun"".Still wouldn't recommend the game as of yet.________________26th August 2014 -This game has potential.However at this current time.It isn't in a state of longetivity.Like with many tycoons the whole focus of the game is money.You start with a basic 1500 gold (sounds like a lot... it isn't)First you have to buy your first building... It's 500 goldmeaning you need to hire your hero to complete quests and so on.Quests will cause damage and will make your hero fatigued.So buying a tavern and a potion shop is vital (600g a piece).After that building roads is the only way to spend your money...Just waiting for more content to play through.So at this moment in time I wouldn't recommend this game.Maybe will change in the future when the game has enough content.If i was the developer i would fix a few things.- More buildings with different effects (probably planned anyway)- Better AI of the characters.- Ability to watch a quest through instead of just seeing numerical data in circles (similar to game maker's exp system)- More freedom with control for design (so you can make a sufficient town)- The game doesn't end immediately when you run out of money (Give a week or two game time)- Explosions (Just kidding)Anyways i hope the developer makes the game better :PPlayed this for 106 minutes in total."

,Not Recommended,314240,26283819,"Posted: 28 October, 2016",all,Corpsing,"Final ThoughtsNot recommended.Game crashed before the tutorial was able to be completed. Occasional user interface (UI) elements persisted on the screen after a menu was closed, the only way to clear the screen was to quit the game and reload. Questing is tedious with a lack of polish to the interface. The hero management interface is broken and only half the intended features seem to work. The item systems is just barely working at this point resulting in game breaking bugs and lost inventory.IntroductionThis game is a unique twist on the classical RPG formula where instead of playing the hero, you manage their city. There are no monsters to battle, but you can train your heroes to improve their base statistics, solve quests to gain followers and cash. The ability to send multiple heroes in a party on epic quests is also fun. Sometimes a sub-quest involving the vanquishing of a villain appears or substantially better loot is to be had. The town has special buildings available once a certain level of experience is obtained.QuestingSending your heroes out on a quest involves a somewhat unique screen where you have to select six pieces of equipment they will take on their journey. This is interesting at first since each piece of equipment has a priority and some does nothing to assist the quest. As the heroes quest, more equipment and missions are unlocked. Once the equipment is placed in its correct priority slot, the mission results in better rewards. Unfortunately, the next time a hero goes on the same quest, this entire setup must be repeated. It gets tedious after a while since ultimately there are 30 different pieces of equipment available and the selection screen is limited to what it displays so there is a lot of scrolling involved. Understandably, the developers added a history screen and indicators to what equipment may be useful, though frustratingly they have this on a different ""history"" screen which causes a lot of back and fourth between the two windows.HeroesThe hero hire screen allows a hero to be hired. The statistics attached to each one has no explanation to what they are for resulting in either a lookup on the internet or just selecting randomly. Once a hero has been hired, they wander the town doing nothing unless they are actively on a quest. Once back from a quest they will be tired or injured. They must be selected on the main map screen and directed to the healing facilities. The hero management interface is broken and telling a hero to go heal from that screen results in the hero ignore the command. This is especially frustrating if there are many civilians exploring the town since it is hard to find a particular hero in the crowd. However, the training options from the hero management work, so get them guns son.ItemsThere seems to be a nice collection of fun items to acquire over the course of a game. Some improve the city, some are equitable on heroes. Unfortunately some of the biggest game breaking bugs come from items. Certain city improvements (rugs and pots) can be used to improve vendors in the game. After making an improvement, the item doesn't disappear and can be reused multiple times. After nearly five minutes upgrading all the vendors millions of gold were added to the treasury every time anything was purchased. Once the upgrades to the city were finished, any items left in the inventory were missing."

And after placing a few building and getting a hero, you need to send him on a quest, 10 times. Sand roads cost a lot in maintenance, and do not make the mistake in thinking this is a city builder, or an adventure game.

The game has a pretty promising start for being early access and in alpha, the questing works and has quite a bit of diversity. Since it's too early in the creation process to critique the game much, the only thing I can say is that one of the downsides is that there aren't enough buildings yet. However, I can't wait for more buildings, more quests and more game in general. Just keep up the good work."

I've been playing nonstop for the past few hours now and it's a really smooth playing game. There is a little learning curve(bankrupted my first kingdom) but once you get used to it, it's not hard.I'll start with my first impressions. There is a tutorial that I'm guessing helps you through it(I skipped it and learned by mistake). The game starts off kinda tedious because you only have a few quick quests you can do at the start and you just cycle through all 5 until you get a few more. You luckily don't have to remember what works best for each quest because it has a history feature which shows what goes with what. The art style reminds me of tycoon type games back in the 90s and early 2000s. The UI is nice and easy to understand with tooltips telling you what each button does. I noticed a few typos but nothing a hotfix can't remedy.After a few hours the game starts to pick up because you can now start what are called Epic Quests. Epic Quests are quests that take 2 or more heroes to start. These quests allow you to get more supplies and quick quests as well as other valuable items like weapons and armor. You don't need to do epic quests just to get more quick quests once you unlock the library(I think kingdom level 3) you can research all types of things from lower maintenance costs for your buildings to more followers per settlement.Don't get me started on modding this game. It's one of the easiest games to mod. First off everything is shown in pretty much plain text(XML) and they have a whole page of the site to help with modding the game. Let's say you want to mod the UI to have a few different textures(I completely changed the color of the UI to green, which you can get on the workshop) all you have to do is go into the UI.png spritesheet change the text you want and next time you load the game it's changed. I recommend making the mod in a folder in the mods folder to make disabling and enabling them easier. Adding quests and heroes is also very easy by just adding a new line to the heroes.xml.Pros:- Easy to use interface- Modding support- Self-explanatory UI and functions- 90s and early 2000s tycoon nostalgia look and feelCons:- Few bugs- Little grindyRating:9.5/10Edit: The customer support is amazing. The new update(1.0.6) broke my save but the dev is already pushing out a fix for it and it's only been like an hour. Not only that but he also helped me through any help I needed for modding."

I found my self building a town with every single building possible and then just sending my hero on quest after quest.

I understand that the developer might speak another language other than English (I hope) but the mistakes need to be fixed before the final release. There was also constantly froze everytime I went to the potion store and it would say I didn't have enough reknown (currency) when I did.All up the game needs to work on keeping excitement constant and not dragging down in 30 minutes.

While hillarious, probabley not what you intended.There's an issue with hiring more than 1 hero ( I can't) and aparently if you hire two of the same kind, then you'll get charged for two, but not be able to use the second.I was finishing up a raiding quest ( i'm fairly sure it was a raid) and it told me ""I need more null""I was more confused when it told me my stealth didn't help and I didn't have any points in stealth for the quest.I'd really like to see the ability to redo a quest you've already done, although I am hoping that they grayed out ""previous quest"" will at one point allow you to do just that.Again, I had fun and I cannot wait to see more from this game in the future.

They also made multi-tasking managable by the game. The only criticism I would make that is gameplay effecting is the lack of a vetted tutorial (some features seem unexplainable still) and there are places where the UI still has resolution problems and collapses on itself (making buttons unpushable). Oh, yeah, and be extra careful not to click delete on your saves when trying to click load... The buttons are very close together and there is no confirmation text box on the delete button (won't make that mistake again!)"

I'd definitely ask anyone who has posted a negative review to give the game another go, it's progressing quite quickly. The game does not yet have many features but the developers have assured us there will be more! I can promise you it will be a good game when it's finished but I suppose we'll just have to wait until then! Right now, the game's not OVERLY enjoyable for long lengths of time so I would recommend maybe plopping it on your wishlist for now and maybe purchasing it when the next Steam Summer Sale comes along. That leaves plenty of time for new features to flood in. Anyway I'd certainly recommend this game and for the price - not bad!I give it a 7.5/10"

Developers, please fix the glitch where, only one quest can be active at a time, even with 2 or more heros, and all other heros leave after the one on a quest returns, i got no idea waz up wit dat. as for the actuall gameplay, it's good but there needs to be more of it, i only have one contract, and the reward is broken. there need to be more upgrades. As of now, it's good but incomplete i'll check back a while later with an updated review. p.s. devs, i could help with trading cards and achieves if needed. thank you.as of AUGUST 18, 2014. The latest Patch fixed many problems. The quest system is much better based on choices rather than sliders. I like that gold is more common ,however reputation is stupidly impossible to come by. I Also noticed that each time i reload the game i have a new list of settlements... this is bad. i understand that it's designed to be more challenging but since you gain more rep on well paired mission to settlement the fact that you can start without any good matches is annoying... it doesn't need fixed.. just wanted to mention it. as of now, I would like to see a better balance of the 2 currencies. While i beleive all early access games are crap waiting to be sifted for diamonds, i do believe i'm starting to see something sparkle.as of MARCH 18, 2015. the first thing that greets any player in any game is the title screen. it is a bit bare but this is a vaugely minimalist game so i'll let it slide... and why can't i open the new game tab? my mouse is in the wrong place!?!?! this can be fixed by carefully oppening the options menu and fitting to screen. right, so, new game. the additions of difficulty and length are much appreciated, now on to the game. i'm mixed on the fences, they do help to limit progression, but that is a double edged sword. the GUI is a lot smoother, heros have stats and abilities clearly visible before purchase. the variety of initial quests is a lot larger and epic quests seem much easier. the ""Approach"" system is much simpler, but i think i liked it better before, but the event system is a fair trade. i also think it's better for kingdoms to be added passively during quests. items have been added and loot being given by quests is very satisfying, it feels like you are really progressing from quest to quest. some sentences seem cut off such as: ""earn 500 gold from"" .the research system is much improved. with as far as i got, a lot has changed, it became more difficult to make stores, there is an end of the year report which tells you who's winning, over all it is much better and i will probably continue it in the future."

But I can see that the developer has really put some effort and heart into making this a better game. It's super addictive and overall a major step up. But regaurdless, it's still a buggy broken mess. From the moment you turn it on, optimization issues abound. There is no good way to play this game. Period. The only way to make the text legible is to make the windows to big that they take up the whole sceen. And as for the game itself... Tourist constantly clip in and out of the ground. When you type your name at the title screen, the text is far away. And I finally had to stop playing whenever my blacksmith shop clipped into the ground and a square over from where I placed it. So I deleted it. But the game permanatly kept those squares blocked off. So... and I kept doing this no matter where I placed the shop. Making my small area unusable (and it didnt help when I realized it autosaves every time you place an object.) So, in short... This would have made a great game to play. but not a great game to pay for. And again... thats where the issue lies. But if you just fix those bugs, you'd be golden.So just keep on trying. And...

LOTS of new and frustrating bugs. Much of the idea of how the game played previously is gone. I ladore aspects of the new build but am remiss to comment because, like game of thrones, i suspect if i love it it will go away.4/6/15 Updated** I have to give it to the guy. Easily the most dedicated solo developer I have ever had the pleasure of interacting with. He ligitimately wants to turn out and enjoyable final product that he devotes quite a bit of time to.The recent changes in my opinion, move the scope of the game quite a bit and dull it up a touch but those are just asthetic. Having watched his work and progress, i believe he will develop a balance that works. Buy his game at the price of half a movie and youll get two movies worth of time out of it with a developer that deserves your assistance. He's going to make good games, lets help him make a middling one.3/18/15  Updated** The most recent update is lightyears ahead of where this developer was previously. The changes that are being made are game benifitial and working. Game still hanging but that is hardly anything more than an inconvience at this alpha stage. The game is much improved but not enough for me to recommend you buy it. There is hope though that the game will turn out a playable and possibly fun game at the end of his journey at this point.** Original review **The most positive thing i can say is the developer is active in the community. I cant say much gets fixed that people talk about but he adds things  then those things break. Its going to end as a mediocre 1/2 done game in my opinion. Its okay and i have played it but even in Alpha or beta or whatever stage is Give me your money while i putz around my house for the next ten years is... its more broke than many better games at or near its price point."

Think of it sort of like spore's creature creator library. Except it works. There are a few balancing issues, and I think that the 'what you take' box for quick quests is a little... erm... what you take doesn't fit what you would use. What I would suggest instead is have you chose the items, and use them for epic quests. Have those items factor into how well you can complete the roll-challenges. (ie.

[Edit - bottom]I really want to enjoy this game but.... It makes me rage in less than 10 seconds, for many reasons.First,to write the town's name, you have to take off the pointer of the namebar or it will always reset.Second, When ever I press ALT or Space, the screen gets redish and I can't get it off.Third, I can't demolish dirt paths.Fourt, I can't even get the clinic at some place because there is no '' square '' to place it there. ( I did have the place for it ). Also, when I change direction of my clinics. It bugs and make it impossible to even see the haf of it and can't place it anywhere else too.I though after a year it would have been more... fixed than this.... Please I know it is your first game but, before getting new stuff in, Fix everything so it can be playable.[ Edit ] As of Update to 0.5. Even tho loading files delete them,it really improved, in term of fixed bugs AND the ''story'' , it changed in a very good way, Everything needs to be worked out to gain buildings through out your achievements which is great, not right in the stomach. I see forward to other improvements and modification of the gameplay. Just for that update, I can say that you should buy it on sales until it's low on price, worth it if it continu that way."

And well there is still a lot of room for upgrades with that, as it shows, there is so much potential that is showing now, and hopefully it can use the rest of the time it has in early access perfectly.Last of all is how it has upgraded so well in its looks and navigation, unlike its original version which had a clunky and broken menu and lacked anything, it now added stuff which are needed, now there is some options still to be added but the important ones are  there, which is great. And also the game is actually possible to navigate, at first it took me about 4 minutes to get into the game, which was a let down at that, but now it is fixed, and takes mere seconds, even less at that, and its worth it.Now with all the positives, the game still does have problems, it does feel that is lacks buildings and size, and after a bit I felt that this stuff could've been added when after all this was a problem for people, though I understand that fixing the game was a big thing needed.So is  it worth buying RPG Tycoon at the moment?Yes it is!Over the course of 6 months this game has came from being a cluggy bit of a mess to a true and great tycoon game, which is worth £5, after all it goes to help the dev upgrade.8.5/10ORIGINAL:Though the game is far from finished, this game just doesn't have any fun to it, and that is most likely because it is very buggy and there is nothing to do, but there is still a lot that can be done while it is in Early Access, but for now i recommend people stay away from this until it gets better as at the minute it is just a borefest"

Well hello little number maybe a 1 or even a lil .5. Nonetheless this game was there and as I really have enjoyed playing GameDevTycoon. I think this game can really learn a few things from Gamedev...Graphics- The graphics are good and very reminiscent of old school Runescape. Which plays in very well into the game.Sliders- The sliders don't make much sense and is very vague.. Also are very cumbersome and need some better sound effects the default Window sound is very unappealing.Knowledge in Game- When you begin the game you are very overwhelmed and yet underwhelmed. You get some basic knowledge and are confused at the same time. You have no idea about what is working within the quests (like within the sliders and what works with what also point allocation).Point allocation- The game has a bug where you can adjust the top portion of the allocation system by minusing them and have it return next quest with the points still remaining where you added them last time.Money- I had no idea you lost the game when you ran out of money and so I ended the game within 2 mins by trying to build my city in more and adding roads.. To only have the game be all like you suck GG.Visitors-Their bubbles of text get stuck behind buildings and cannot be read.Quests and making money- NOOO Clue how to make good money, felt like I’m just waiting for my quests tooooo sllllooowwwwllllyyyy produce the little change each time.. Perhaps needs to be upped a bit? or I'm just a bit inpatient, who knows probably the second. The quests also need to be clearer and more feedback is needed and perhaps a memory system again similar to GameDev...UI- is very clear and clean but needs some better animations and sound effects. Hopefully they will add in better tutorials and make the game easier to jump in.Questing- Please make the UI more fun and clear when your hero is on a quest. You get no idea why points are getting added into the certain places.As I said before game looks great, shows a lot of promise and I can't wait for it to be finished to really log in some hours. I hope they change the music to something a lil catchier, add in some better sound effects, update the UI a bit more, and clean up the game all around to be honest. Will play more, look forward to the full release.Thanks for reading my rant. (PS: I’ve only spent a few times on this game so read my review with that in mind)"

One of those early access games so early in development, it felt like a gyp. It was like that for quite some time up until roughly the second half of 2015. That's when the developer finally got serious working on his game. I've seen RPG Tycoon grow and mature over time to a point where it is now showing promise and potential to be a decent albiet simple and crude management simulator.In my previous review, I  did not recommend due to how unstable it was and a memory leak that slowed the game down so much it became unplayable.Since then, those two issues are gone. I now recommend RPG Tycoon!Well, as an alpha anyway.RPG Tycoon is far from complete. Some features are still obviously being worked on. There are still annoying bugs you can't avoid while playing. Game is in need of balance tweaks. Loading save games still has a high risk of causing something to glitch out. Visitors still tend to get frozen in place and never leave.But the game is now in a state that I can call playable. Its pretty okay for what it is too.Basically if you've been eyeballing this game thinking about buying it, I'd say its safe to buy now. The developer is now supporting their game and updates are churning out more frequently. But, obviously, if you're one of those types who can't stand unfinished/buggy games steer clear for the time being. RPG Tycoon has a long way to go still."

I love this kind of games and some of the concepts are nice, but now there is simply not enough content and feature. If it ever eventually ships, it's worth considering. Right now, don't buy it, it's too empty.--Now, I've kinda changed my mind. RPG Tycoon has definitely reached the point where it's actually a full fledged game. You start with a very small patch of land on which you can build a couple of base buildings just to attract some adventurers to send questing. You slowly build up from there, trying to attract tourists from other Kingdoms. It's a game of progressive growth with some kingdom management and an interesting questing system based on guessing what are the correct combinations of supplies to bring while doing a specific activity (original yes, fun I don't know yet). All in all, a pretty likeable kingdom sim so why not, give it a try. Now it's worth it at its price range."
,Recommended,314240,11855839,"Posted: 24 August, 2014",all,Sunzo,"**********Updated 2/10/2015**********Below you'll see my previous reviews, I'm keeping them there as the review grows, so that any who are interested can see the progress made.Just like last time, I'll list off bugs first:1: Whenever two heroes rest in the same building, one of them will get locked in that building, and will never come out. the only way to get that hero back, is to sack them, watch their avatar leave the town and then rehire them.2: Various mispellings, if those even count as bugs.3: That's it, I haven't encountered any other bugs lately.Btw, for a TL;DR version, scroll to the bottom, just before the next updated line.So how is the game different now?Quick Quests now have a unique gameplay to them, that I haven't played in another tycoon game.First you select a town, then you select a quest type, after selecting that quest type, you have a screen of supplies, the supply screen is what I can assume the influences from Game Dev Tycoon turned into, and it adapts well.You see, each town requires different supplies on different quests, so even if you do a Raider quest in town A, and get all 6 supplies matched in their correct slots, that doesn't mean it'll be the same way in town B.You also do not get all the supplies straight off the bat, while I can't say I like having those supplies withheld, it makes for a lot of replayability as you try and earn all the supplies, so it ends up being pretty damn enjoyable.The Epic quests however feel lacking in comparison to the quick quests, and I think they could really utilise their own unique gameplay, I already see evidence of how this could be achieved with the mid quest story prompts, but I'd like to see something at the start, similar to quick quest's preparation stage, but unique.I don't understand the bounties very well at the moment, I searched for a villain and afterward that quest line became unaccessible.One of my major complaints in the previous versions was the lack of feedback, this has been corrected and there's now a lot of information on the screen, The hud can feel a bit encumbering, I'd like to either see the hud size be controllable in the options, but that wouldn't need to be an exact option, many other solutions would work.The top left window can be minimized but others can not. however, the bottom left one, shouldn't be able to be minimized, I'd rather see it fade into the background when a target isn't selected. I'd also like to see the bottom left window only function when a target is clicked instead of hovered over.The top right information feed, feels rather rough, the messages don't need to stay for long and could actually be automatically deleted for you, I'm sure though that the developer is looking at this, with his own solution in mind.The rest of the hud however, is well designed, pleasing to the eyes and gives relevant information.The research is good, but feels like it lacks a lot of research, and I'd like to see it play a second role.The town management is coming along nicely, and while playing, I actually thought that it was possible to create a self sustaining town, that does not rely on the funds from your heroes.I would like to see that be a thing, a self sustaining town, but I'd rather see it as a possible avenue for development in the game that you have to specifically pursue, and not an eventuality that every playthrough will lead to.TL;DR:The game is now at a playable stage, and the game finally has a strong foundation to fall back on, that doesn't take too heavily from other games.It's enjoyable, and in the playthrough that lead to this updated review, I actually sunk a few hours into it all at once.Rating:What it is: 6.5/10What it could be: 9/10I'm excited to see the end product when it leaves early access, I believe it'd net a 7.5/10 at this rate.********Updated 18/03/2015********First off, a lot of my old points are still rather relevant, the game hasn't terribly improved, and still stands as one of the more broken Early Access games I've played.First to the bugs:I haven't encountered any of the old bugs, but now I've met some of the new ones, one of them is map scrolling, if you roll your cursor to the edge, it scrolls, simple, lots of games have that, but some times when you roll your cursor to one of the edges, it doesn't scroll the map, and you have to jiggle the cursor at the right side of the screen to free it up.Then there's the auto continue, whenever a message pops up, something in the game will happen for example: auto save and the game will continue without me, while I read, the messages are quite length in this game too, so that creates a problem.Finally autosaving also flashes the screen, which is insanely annoying.The developer has steered away from it's Game Dev Tycoon inspired system, however it's current system isn't very interesting, and is still rather cryptic, because you don't get enough feedback after a quest as to why you got a bad rating, and some times the messages get repeated meaning what could have been a useful third message gets pushed off the table by a message I've already read.The game still isn't very interesting, and often puts me asleep, Still not a fan of the art direction, and the gameplay is lacking.At this time, I do not recommend this game.4/10 for the game as is.8/10 for the potential game, that I hope it one day becomes.******First Version******First off, I have to quickly explain:No, I do not hate this game, I actually really really like it and it's concept.The recommendation is in reference to it's playability in the current build.With that out of the way.RPG Tycoon scratches an itch that I love, Management games, I've had a thing for them since I played Rollercoaster Tycoon 2.So the ability to create my own RPG town, send heroes on quests and promote my town sounds like a heavenly game to me.But RPG Tycoon is still in early access, the major reason I do not recommend it is bugs, the game is at this current stage full of bugs and glitches, which is not surprising with an Early Access game, that's just early access for you, the developers are still making the game, bugs and glitches are to be expected, But at this time due to some game breaking bugs I can't recommend it.These bugs include (but are only limited to what I've seen thus far)-Duplicating heroes-Time pausing days not progressing but quests remaining open and progressing without reaching a climax.-Saving and Loading does not take the game back to before the bugs occured (not a bug, but is annoying when trying to avoid bugs)And with that part out of the way, here is the rest of my thoughts:The concept is great, I can't wait to see this in a playable state.The graphic style itself I can't say I'm a fan of, I'd like it to be different, but at the same time, it doesn't matter, I'll happily ignore that.The Game Dev Tycoon type of direction with quests is both familiar and inviting, making me wish to try the same quest multiple times, however I feel there needs to be a way to investigate these quests to get hints at what are the right and wrong choices.The music is excellent, it reminds me of minecraft but not in a way that feels bland and unoriginal, the music feels like a winner.Add in random events to the final release? that would be amazing.I can't wait to see the potential for large towns with sprawlling citizens and several different buildings like blacksmith, tailor and what not.I'd like to also request a micromanagement system with the citizens, giving them jobs I mean, and having them live within your city.I have so many high hopes for this game, and I can't wait until it's in a more playable state so I can sit down for a good while and play it.Buy it? please do! the more purchases the more funding, the more funding the quick and better the progression."

,Not Recommended,314240,15100366,"Posted: 28 March, 2015",all,Villager of Death,"The new version is so weird because my heroes always suck at quests because the game gives VERY minimal output as to waht helps and what doesn't on a quest. For example natural I'd assume we would need food, Weapons, Camping supplies, and Navigation help for hunting because the food would be used for bait, The Weapons to kill animals, the camping supplies for following herds, and the navigation help for finding said herds. But then food just hinders the quest (I assume? It just has food in red) and it's almost impossible to find the right combination. ALSO WHY WOULD YOU MAKE RESEARCH DESCRIPTIONS NOT FIT LIKE HOW!

76561198061032562,Recommended,314240,16133538,"Posted: 2 June, 2015",all,Count_Joshoo,"Like many other reviews I give this thumbs up for potential.  The game still needs a ton of work and fine tuning and, frankly, content.On the PROS side is the basic concept.  Run a village as AI Heroes do all the adventuring.  I have no doubt the finished product will be a good game and worth the money, but I'm holding out hope that it will be a great game that is a steal for the price.On the CONS side there is a quite a bit wrong or off.  The FTL lite ""Epic Quests"" feel like random 50/50 guesses.  When it asked me to help a farmer with his pigs 4 times in 4 straight quests I said ""yes"" all four times.  Wrong each time.  However I have no idea how this matters other than XP not gained.  This transitions nicely into the overall lack of a feeling that my decisions matter other than keeping the town in net gains money wise.  2 hours into the game and I don't even read the quest bits anymore, I just pick and option at random and roll on.  100+ hours in FTL and I still read the text.The notifications are also super annoying, they constantly pop up to tell me that it is autosaving, which by the way is frequent and necessary, and to tell me a quest is done.  Of course the quest is done, I just navigated a bunch of pop ups telling me the same information.  Again, we are dealing with information that quickly becomes superflous, which is not a great trait for a resource management game to have.The bonus giving objective queue seems to run out after about 4 sets, though if I remember correctly the Dev noted that is going to be a big part of the next update.I know I mostly have complaints/critiques here, and I could probably find more.  So why recommended still? Because I really really want this game to be great, it's my first alpha build purchase and I want other people to try it out and offer even smarter feedback than I can.Thanks for what you are doing Dev, for the large amount of resource management games out there the lack of quality and non-Farmville variety is sad.  Keep working hard and making this game everything it can grow to be!"

There are of course good and bad points to the game, however with most of the bad ones gone; the game has become very enjoyable. I would now happily recommend the game, just read about the current bugs beforehand so you can really enjoy the wonderful game of RPG Tycoon.I shall not detail you with what has been fixed as you should no longer have those issues, and so I have listed the bugs and errors that I encountered while playing this time around.Minor Isues;1) Without any load files, the load screen shows a fourth place that is partially outside the box, very minor but I like neatness2) Maybe I did not realise how I was playing but suddenly my kingdom had 1% attraction and all three settlement’s had minimal to no “likeness”. This caused me to resort to spamming my kingdom with decorations just to keep a solid income.3) Missing sprites when I once tried to use “bread” on a hero, clicking out and clicking back in solved this.4) A few text bugs and issues when viewing your heroes5) When you find multiple items with the same image, you can see the additional text of the first one, but not the second, this however is only for this moment and can be viewed normally in your inventory6) Once when my main hero (The first to hire) went into the “Potion Store” and was finished, his name and a bar was still there above the shop, the hero could do all actions normally and this text issue only disappeared when he returned into the same shop (a few in-game years later)Major Issues;1) Manually saved and loaded the save file in the second slot (Not Auto-Save), my first 2 heroes that were the quest leaders had returned instantly along with the 2 other heroes that were on the “Epic Quest”, however I could no longer select to do either the “Quick Quest” or “Epic Quest” as I believe the system thinks that they are still on this quest, however with no quest bar at the bottom it could not be fixed. This was a major problem so a long time in-game later I saved it manually again, and loaded it, the issue was fixed, however by then I fired my heroes.All remaining issues were found after the second loading.2) The villainy tracker had all reset, as well the bounty level had reset.3) The first of each quest type rewarded me with 0 Gold and 0 Followers, each quest after this was normal.4) One time my hero just never returned from an “Epic Quest”5) Lag started to occur quite a lot.6) Upon saving and leaving the game, the title screen had turned black, except from a centre square in the screen big enough to see the game was still running, however I could not click on any buttons as they were inside the black screen. This resulted in me having to change tabs out of the game, and manually closing the application."

Once I bought the strongest hero available I was waiting for 10 minutes for him to do a quest,  and although he was receiving a lot of points, I couldnt put any other heroes out on quests while this was happening. Many other glitches like this occured until I just had to quit because it was ruining the game. Apart from that, it was a great concept, but it was released far too early and the bugs are just unbearable!"

I'll start with the bad.Yes people have said bugs, but what bugs? Let me mention my two most annoying ones.1. Deleted/messed up save files. I'll go back in to play and I will be pushed back by a lot of progress and I'll forget how I got to where I'd been so I just start over which is really annoying after the 5th time. The most recent occurence could have been because the game updated, not sure.2. I would click on a character and click on their name and a box would come up, but I couldn't get rid of it and I would have to close out of the game and lose my progress.In addition to this it does bother me a bit that the difficulty curve on epic quests is a bit odd but whatever.Now on to the good!I first purchased this game I think last year? Not sure exactly. But a ton of things have been improved since then making things more logical, giving more options, and I love all of the equipment and items. Really it's becoming a thorough game.I think that this game has a ton of potential but it's still not perfect. I really suggest that anyone try this out, especially those who like time management, rpg mechanics, tycoon games (obviously), or anyone with some free time on their hands. The price is worth it."
