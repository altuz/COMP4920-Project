Honestly, it makes for a rather dull experience overall.  Let's start from the beginning so we can get an idea of what's wrong with it:1) Enemy placement - Enemies are often placed in areas that aren't well thought out (or perhaps they are, but for the wrong reasons). You'll find yourself tapping the controller or keyboard to move forward rather than have your character move at a constant rate for fear of an enemy popping up on the very edge of the screen and immediately firing. While this isn't terrible if you are into that sort of thing, I like to play my run-'n'-gun style of games where I'm actually RUNNING and GUNNING, not stutter stepping and jumping.2) Weapons - Good lord are the things generally useless. A bullet spray that shoots in a random barrage of bullets? Why not just make it the ever classic spread from Contra? In this, the bullets might miss smaller targets generally, and require me to maneuver in bizarre fashions to maximize the damage from an enemy.A misslie launcher? Sounds amazing, except it's not because the missiles generally have this nasty tendency to fly upwards after a few moments of being shot so they always seem to skirt *around* the enemies rather than at them! If that wasn't bad enough, the missiles are incredibly slow as well. Lame.Boomerangs? Okay, these actually aren't that bad, but it WOULD be better if you could switch between them and your standard gun.I could go on and on about them, but let's just say that most of them are a noticeable downgrade from your standard shot. This is absolutely not good at all. Sure, you can have weapons that are better at moments, but having them be worst in almost any conceivable situation is absolutely unacceptable.I especially love how the drops are random, so until you actually remember the symbols for your power-ups, you'll never actually be able to know which ones are actually useful or not (just skip most of them). Even worse is that some of them are a ""partner"" powerup, so there's no reason to not have those guys even if they have limited ammo and most aren't particularly helpful.The Jet idea is pretty nifty but I feel like it's not utilized very well. Let's take the first mini-boss for instance, using your jet dodges every single attack it has, and even in hardcore mode, by the time it's actually ready to charge its next attack, your jet meter has already filled back up to the top again and can be used to dodge. I'm not saying remove the jet, but the enemies should have more attacks since the game knows that you will ALWAYS have the jetpack.Lastly, I absolutely hate how the vast majority of the enemies are over your character's head but you cannot shoot up. That's not how you design something. Yes, I get that the jet pack is there to let you level out with the enemies, but it's excessive from as early as state 1, area 1-1. The helicopters should most definitely have a method of being shot at if you run underneath them outside of running backwards to shoot it (which causes enemies behind you to respawn), or running passed it; this makes it even more pointless to fight as it's no longer an obstacle.All and all, it's not the most wretched game I've played-- it's not even really bad, it's just... Not good. In any real way.Why was my review so long? I don't know, maybe it's a message to the developer so he can make a better game. I feel like if he made ""Jet Gunner 2"" and got rid of the above problems, the game might be pretty good."

If it were a real console, I couldn't be happier with the launch line up, and Jet Gunner rounds things out so nicely with amazing run and gun platformer action - the first of its kind that really feels like an NES game but with none of the things that make going back to that console sometimes a little disappointing. Jet Gunner has the pallet and graphics you remember, but the controls are way more air tight and the whole experince is just smooth as silk. It really says something about this game when it saves your progress so you can continue from the last level you played but I always choose to play from the begining anyway because the experince is just so much fun. This may be the best purchase I've made on steam so far. I could give this game a simple but controversial three word review, and I mean this sincerely: ""Better than contra."" This game isn't just reminecent of the NES era, its what we all thought NES gaming should have been but so rarely was. With some distance between us and that wonder console now we can finally craft games that emulates its unique style but corrects all its limitations to bring a simple, addictive, and blissful gaming experince and Jet Gunner shows them how its done. Plus a hardcore a challanges mode to keep you coming back to master the game (and unlike many games, this one is actually fun to pursue mastery of) long after you've beaten it standard.  I really hope other retro style game developers are taking notes on this title but even more than that, I need Jet Gunner 2 to be a thing in my life."

It has lots of enemies that respawn if you backtrack, lots of powerups which can significantly alter the behaviour of your weapon and you even come equipped with a jetpack. Powerups are also randomized so you can't beat the game strictly by trial and error making skill and reflexes key. The presentation is absolutely spot on right down to the segmented health/energy bars and achieves the retro 8-bit style perfectly -- it looks, sounds and plays just like an NES game. The sprites are large and easy to distinguish and they explode into colorful 8-bit pieces!My only issue with the game is that the controls aren't as tight as I would like them to be. Sometimes when I try to move in the opposite direction it doesn't register particulary if I do it too quickly. Furthermore you can't remap the controls and the only controller it supports is the 360 gamepad, and it's not very playable with it because the controls are significantly delayed however the developer is working on fixing it. The options currently don't save either and be warned: This game is ***VERY LOUD*** when you first load it up.But all in all, it's a great game that does what it sets out to do very well. It took me an hour just to beat the first stage and there's 6 in total. So make no mistake it is hard, especially unforgiving in hardcore mode. If that's what you're looking for, then for the price you really can't wrong with this."

So many fantastic Famitracker musicians out there could have been hired to create a wonderfully composed and fitting soundtrack for this game; I don't really know what happened here, but it's very disappointing.- The game's over with extremely quickly, even compared to NES games of very modest length, perhaps partly due to how rarely you'll die and be forced to memorize the stage and boss patterns as perfectly as most such games.  It might be worth it to crank up the difficulty even on your first playthrough if you're an experienced retro gamer for this reason.- Cutscenes are completely pointless even for a guy like me who generally enjoys them; simply slapping sprites that are weirdly ugly compared to the rest of the game of your player character and his boss and having them spout one or two very basic lines doesn't really have a place.  Either go for Ninja Gaiden-style quality, Clash at Demonhead-style humor or just don't bother.Overall, though, the fun factor and quality of *most* of the game is high enough that this title is absolutely worth the price tag for any oldschool action/platformer/run-and-gun fan."

I also liked the fact you never know the weapon you'll get - so every time you play the game it feels fresh and different.3) The extra game included ""Alien Splatter"" is also very nice.4) The jet! It's very original and well planned. Makes me wonder how nobody used this mechanic back in the 1980s.

It's in the vein of the old run and gun games of yesteryear but the addition of the jetpack adds a new twist.  The mechanics behind the way the jetpack refuels means you can't just ""cheese"" a level, you actually have to be precise and not waste fuel while in the air.  The level design puts your platforming skills to the test while making sure you are blasting everything in sight.  While some of the guns in the game seem strange at first, once you get to know how to use them effectivly you become a machine of robotic death.  When you buy this game make sure you have an Xbox 360 controller plugged in and are ready for the ride of your life!!"

Picking these up is actually a death sentence.- Poor level design. Some levels (especially stage 3) don't contain enough space to manouvre while being littered with objects.- Poor enemy positioning.- Hard to avoid enemy attacks because they'll fire the moment they pop-in while having a short distance between your character and edge of the screen.I would like to see a sequel adressing these problems because using the jetpack is fun. Get Sinclair's Fist Slash or Alien Splatter instead, those are way better."
,Recommended,314250,29026278,Posted: 4 January,all,Capt_Blakhelm,"First Impression: Jet Gunner is..alright. It captures the look and feel of a NES run and gunner graphically and soundtrack wise, and the idea of a limited backpack with a variety of weapons sound like a potential idea for something like a sequel to Power Blade 2. The problem is that running and gunning will get you killed even though it is a ""run and gunner"". Standard ground enemies will shoot the moment they appear on screen and their bullets are very quick - so instead of playing the game ""Contra"" style where you should either kill the enemy quick or jump over the slow moving bullet, you should step carefully and ""bait the enemy into shooting"" so you can then jump the projectile and try to kill them.Some powerups feel alot worse than the standard auto rifle - a slow firing, slow moving shockwave, a somewhat homing giant boomerange with only two projectiles at a time, innacurate missiles. Some weapons are clearly better than others, and unlike Contra, the weapons that spawn are random, so you can't optimize your playthrough for the best weapon.I also found some enemy and trap placement a bit cheap. This is probably a way to ""make the game classic Nintendo"" hard,"" but this is a bad design decision from the NES era that makes the game a bit unfair and not fun - it's another reason why you must play carefully instead of constantly running like in Contra and sometimes need to inch the screen forward bit by bit. I had a turret shoot me the minute I jumped on a moving platform in Stage 2 and I died from falling a pit. There are also Super Mario Bro's style firewhips that don't show up unless they are completely on your screen, making platforming more difficult than it needs to be. Also, you can only shoot forward and not in directions, which is problematic with some enemy types, but most of game seems built around it.I got to stage 3 and I think the game is OK and gets better with trial and error vs pure skill.  I see $1 worth of content here, though I only recommend this to big fans of NES/NES style games."

You just need to have a general idea, it doesn't have to be a second Psychonauts it isn't meant for story. People are also saying it is trying to be contra but there is a difference between trying and being based off of or similar too. It isn't trying to replace or be contra, it is SUPPOSE to feel and look like Contra! It wasn't planning on being exactly the same it just wanted a similar feel.

,Not Recommended,314250,11569291,"Posted: 5 August, 2014",all,Squire Grooktook,"Jet Gunner is a side scrolling run and gun shooter that utilizes a jet pack for more high flying platforming and combat. While this mechanic is interesting, and I am a fan of arcade style run and gun shooters, I feel the execution here is a bit subpar.The jet pack works in that after jumping, you can press or hold the button as many times as you want to ascend while fuel holds out. The way fuel is handled though is perhaps my biggest complaint about the mechanic itself. Instead of having a set amount you can rise per jump, you have a fuel meter which slowly recharges when not jet packing. What this essentially means is that before or after many jumps, you'll have to sit still and wait for the meter to finish recharging before you can go again. While it's not terriblye noticeable most of the time (it recharges quickly), it still cramps the games fast paced run and gun action a bit, and makes the jetpacks use feel a bit more limited and restrained than it should be (in my opinion).Beyond the jetpack system, there's also a weapon system in which you can stock a standard weapon and a floating satelite (with limited use), mixing and matching the two. However some of the weapons vary in usefulness a bit too much. The worst offenders being a flame thrower with far too short range, a gun that shoots directly above and below you but not in front, an incredibly slow moving wide shot, and a missle launcher with pitiful speed and an annoying randomized aim. I can appreciate the attempt at variety in the weapons, but a few too many of them harm you more than anything. In fact, pretty much everything that's not a standard straight shot is pretty awful.The level design doesn't make good use of the jetpack consistently enough. Occaisionally, there are interesting acrobatic manuevers, but these are a bit too far and few between. For the most part, the jetpack is just used to jump over slightly lengthier bottomless pits or other such hazards that could just have easily been solved with a more traditional double jump. Beyond jetpack use, the level design  is not particularly interesting, with fairly standard run and jump layouts for about half of the game. Enemy design is a bit weak, mostly consisting of standard foes who simply shoot at you before dying, forcing a single duck or jump whilst being too static to force any kind of improvisation or quick reflex once memorized.Boss design varies. A few bosses (the first one, for example) offer great design with a mix of strategy, reflexes (thanks to some slightly random attack patterns), and a need to use your jetpack well. But like the stages, some of them are a bit uneven, with a few snoozer fights numbering equally against the genuinely fun ones.The game also has occaisional flaws and cheap moments in level and boss design that makes the whole experience feel a bit unpolished and poorly play tested. Examples:-On stage 1, you stand on a small moving platform over a bottomless pit, and pass under a block that prevents you from jumping. On a nearby wall, an enemy climbs up and down the wall and fires when you enter within range. If you're lucky, it won't pass by while you're under the block, or at least will fire at a height where you can duck, otherwise damage will be unavoidable if it happens to pass by at a crouching level.-On stage 2, a miniboss has a pattern in which it fires a random spray of slow moving bullets, followed up by an unreactable (I think) slew of fast and random cannon balls that are only consistently dodged by staying directly underneath the cannon. If you get bad rng on the slow moving bullets, you can get a wall of bullets that forcibly prevents you from getting to the safe zone, and results in unavoidable damage.-On stage 4, a platform moves when you jump on it, with ceiling fans that prevent you from jet packing. If you get knocked back onto the previous ledge (or jump back there for safety in avoiding an incoming enemy) you will be completely incapable of reaching the platform and will have to suicide in order to get it to respawn-etc.Overall not a bad game, but a very simple memorizer with a few standout moments and a few flaws holding it back. The gimmick is neat but stirkes me more as something with potential that's not fully realized here. If you really enjoy the genre, you may enjoy this, but I'd personally recommend something more masterful like Bleed first."

I have no issue with the game taking cues from nostalgic pieces, but it hasn't done much in terms of smoothing out some of the rougher edges of gameplay. Enemy bullets fly entirely too fast. Your characters seemingly takes ages to simply turn around. Not having full controller support makes playing the game an unneccesary challenge.

""Challenging"" gameplay allows the user to make a choice and react, which this game doesn't give you much of a chance to do. Whenever an enemy enters the screen he immediately fires his weapon, giving you no time to react because the shot has hit you before the enemy is fully visible. Also if you land on the same platform as an enemy he will immediately fire, once again not giving you a chance to react to it. It's not challenging, it's flat out unfair.I started my first playthrough on Hardcore Mode because i wanted a really solid challenge but was unable to even get past the first level due to having no indication of when an enmy will fire his high velocity lasers at me. Hardcore Mode doesn't allow you to collect extra lives or health pickups and you take double damage, so trying to get through the very long levels having only 3 lives is nothing short of impossible.This game looked cool but it's just way too punishing to the point where it's not fun and i feel i don't have control over a situations outcome. The dev needs to analyze retro games to see the difference between challenge and punishment. A good start would be adding a visual indication that the enemy is about to fire his weapon, that way the player has the chance to react and will only have himself to blame if they aren't fast enough. I'll always appreciate an atempt to bring back challenging retro games, but this just doesn't do it right."

I just hope they will patch the game because the input for controllers are really unstable...use xpadder or hoy2key instead !!!!!Beside that, good game but like I said can't wait for a patch because it is frustrating sometimes !"

For anything deeper than that - I'd steer clear. The later challenges are nigh on unplayable, where you end up going through walls, and even getting stuck(!)."

,Not Recommended,314250,28814175,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,Kevin 64,"This is a pretty cool NES-style game that's pretty cheap. You have a jetpack and you fly around picking up new weapon upgrades and shooting robots. The upgrades don't get better though. It's kinda like Ghosts n' Goblins where there's random power-ups throughout the game. The only difference is that in this one, there isn't really a ""good"" weapon. They're all have their strengths and weaknesses. The gameplay is fine, but unoriginal. all you do is get to the end of the screen and fight a boss. Nothing new. If you want to play a better retro game, play Shovel Knight. This one is pretty mediocre."

Este jogo tem como objetivo fazer relembrar os velhos tempos da NES e na minha opinião, acho que cumpre bem o seu papel. Não é nada de extraordinário, temos 6 níveis para completarmos com dificuldade á nossa escolha e temos um conjunto de Challenges para quem quiser entreter-se mais com o jogo. A qualidade de gráficos, aúdio e jogabilidade está tudo no ponto e o desafio não falta, especialmente nas partes finais(vá se foder a força da gravidade). Para o preço que é, acho que vale muitíssimo a pena e para quem quer experimentar um pouco do que é o ""Retro Gaming"", este é um jogo indicado para si! ;)English:Jet Gunner is a 2D side-scroller reminding me of Contra and Megaman, big classics on the NES. This game aims to remind us the good old times of the NES and in my opinion, it does the job well. There´s nothing extraordinary here, we´ve got 6 levels to beat(with difficulty of our choosing) and we have a set of challenges for anyone who wants to spend more time in the game. The graphics, the sound and the gameplay quality are all fine and the challenge is great, especially in the last levels(♥♥♥♥ gravity). Given the price, I think it´s very worth and for anyone who wants to taste a little bit of the ""Retro Gaming Spirit"", this is the game for you! ;)"

Beside playing any NES games, I want any new games that have not release in NES console and I don't want to hook up NES console.  I was in the mood to play any hardcore 8-bit game in modern day and found this game. This is excatly what I am looking for! I am glad this day and age the 8-bit games still alive and kicking! It made me feel like I am back in the 90s!  If you miss 8-bit game with any kind of genres but don't want to play any on NES? This is for you. Not just for classic gamers, but also for any who willing to play hard games and have mindset to beat this game, then it for you!I recommend controller pad call ""NES30""http://www.nes30.com/and I also use software call JoyToKey."
,Recommended,314250,32223879,Posted: 6 June,all,SuperPokeunicorn,"Jet gunner successfully carves out its own identity in the crowded genre of retro inspired platformers. Some may be quick to make the Mega Man comparison, but it's clearly a lot more Contra crossed with Shatterhand with its own twists added in, namely the titular jetpack. The hovering controls feel very fluid and give you a wide range of movement options, though waiting for the jetpack to recharge was occasionally annoying, especially when the buddy bots only stick around for a limited time. Though there are a few poorly designed sections that stick out, the design of the enemies and level mechanics overall is clever and very well thought out. The weapon variety is nice, especially when considering the many combinations of guns and buddy bots, although some weapons are certainly lacking and feel bad to play with, namely the ones that limit your fire rate. The visual aesthetic is very nice, with colors that absolutely pop, though certain foreground elements looked like background elements and vise versa. The audio design is a bit hit or miss; the music is good, if a bit understated, but certain weapons don't have the impactful sound effects they deserve. All in all, Jet Gunner is a fun experience, if a bit short and occasionally rough around the edges. I'd certainly recommend it for the given price."
