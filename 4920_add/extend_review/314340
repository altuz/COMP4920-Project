But only for the game... Chess 2 does not have a UI that reflects the price. Moreover it's lack of in-game chat between players, the missing rating and post-game stats and the slow-pace (The graphics seem sloppy, it makes me think twice if I'm clicking the right spot) don't help...They new rules are indeed genius but it needs much more to get to its actual price. The game just feels incomplete. I really hope they put work on it but in the state it actually is...  I do not recommend the game."

It feels like very little work was done to port this from Ouya. There are zero options: you cannot adjust resolution, quality, you can't even adjust the volume or turn off the music! The menu's don't seem to like being controlled by mice, you can only click on the deepest ""slice"" of a menu, even if the other menu options are on the screen.Online play also has zero options. You search for a game and pick an army, but have no control over who you play or extra rules like the time each player gets. There is no rating system for players, no chat system, no friends system, no ability to start a game with a specific person (!), nothing. This application is missing SO MUCH that paying $20 for it makes me feel ripped off. This is not $20 of quality. This is like $4 of quality. Maybe. I'd pay $5 if I could turn off the terrible music.In other words: don't expect much."
,Recommended,314340,11803373,"Posted: 21 August, 2014",all,roder,"EDIT: There are no more future updates (afaik) planned for the game, and IMO its a great game but wasn't fully fleshed out with all the basic features. The population has bottomed out, so if you're buying it for multiplayer then you may be out of luck in finding games. This isn't really the developers fault, as indie games have a hard time in capturing a big multiplayer player pool. It was an interesting take for a chess variant, and I hope more tactics games similar to it come out. I am always looking for that next pvp tactical game.To Chess Players:If you're more of a tactics player (short term captures and plans), you'll enjoy this game. Chess 2 (C2) is a much more fast-paced and unpredictable game than traditional Chess. C2 has 6 armies to choose from (there is the classic Chess army, but also new armies with unique units & movesets), and you can face any of them from your opponent, so games will have very diverse matchups each time. There are also 2 ways to win: Getting your king past midline and checkmate. This ensures games are faster and have less draws. But with the midline invasion rule, it is very ""race-to-win""; there are less quiet moves, less subtle improving moves to a better position, less strategic play. Rather, its more just a string of tactical plays IMO.Knowledge of Chess can help you in C2, but it will only help you so far. You can throw most chess rule-of-thumbs out the window, as there are new pieces with new rules. Controlling the center is good, but controlling the sides is also important as the king usually tries to flank to one side to invade midline instead of going into the center where he'll be mated. Castling early and often is actually a bad move. Fianchetto is waste of tempo, as bishops are on a better diagonal from their starting position. Knights are usually better in C2 because its usually semi-closed or closed positions. And because of that, rooks are usually worse pieces because the position is closed, but also because you castle less often providing less exits for your king rook. However, pawn majority in center is still important (if not even more important), and also the knight on the rim is still grim :-)If you liked Chess because of same teams and starting off on even foot, you might dislike the 6 different teams. They are balanced, but are balanced in a bubble (as in they are balanced with respect to Classic Chess army, but some have advantage/disadvantage versus each other). It's a case of Perfect Imbalance (Two Kings army>Reaper>Nemesis>Two Kings). So you might dislike the fact that your army performs better/worse versus the enemy team, but it is is only slight advantage. But this provides opportunity for each game and opening to be very unique. Another factor in the game is the duel system (betting system). Whenever a piece is captured, you can bet against your opponent for the fate of the unit doing the capturing (that unit will also be removed if you lose the bet). This duel system was implemented for mind games, but it is only wild guessing IMO. It is like rock paper scissors, the player that picks his weapon by thinking 7 moves ahead is just as good as the player thinking only 4 moves ahead or 1 move ahead. Although there are limits to the betting system (you only gain betting stones by destroying an enemy pawn), and it is more complicated than I give it credit for, it is still for the most part an arbitrary system.Overall, I would recommend C2 to chess players, because of its familiarity to Chess but also because it brings new life and something refreshing to it. The less you think of it as chess + new elements, but rather just a new board game with chess elements, the more you will enjoy the game for what it really is :) GL HF."
,Not Recommended,314340,11862446,"Posted: 25 August, 2014",all,SendMoreCops,"I want to like this game so much. The ideas behind Chess 2 seem so good. So far Chess 2 seems like a great Chess variant.The problem is that this particular implementation just seems unfinished. You can play Chess 2 against a horribly weak AI. You can play live in 25 minutes a side games and you can play Correspondence games. Your rating goes up if you win and down if you lose (presumably based on your opponents rating).The game looks nice and bar a few crashes, plays smoothly. But there is so much missing that you would normally take for granted.No rankings ! You can see your opponents rating and yours in game. Out of game you see...nothing. No win/loss ratios. No breakdown of each armies win/loss. No leaderboards!!!!You cannot challenge a friend. You play against random opponents only.For a game that's supposed to be all about multiplayer this is just unforgivable.There are no options. You window resize (unless you edit the game launch properties yourself). The music is nice but you cannot turn it down. You cannot even turn it OFF !Your games are saved for replay. There's no chess notation. You cannot view your opponents or your own previous moves.Even the Steam Achievements are just so boring. Again, just ... barely ... there.Mind boggling. If this was early access I'd give it some slack as the core of the game is there and it is great. But in 2014 the total lack of any features is crazy. Especially when you consider the price.Hopefully the game can get some much needed support and thrive but we will have to wait and see.Right now... I would not recommend this to anyone."

It has some bugs and is missing some features but the core is great and that is what really matters when it comes to games. Some more options and features would have been nice but it has all the essential pieces and you will certainly be able to enjoy the game for a long time.It is simple enough that you can get into it fairly quickly but advanced enough so it will feel fresh for a long time and surprise you with new combos and strategies. A must try for fans of the turn based strategy genre or chess fans. If you want a strategy game without luck then this might be the game for you.The six armies manages to make new games feel fresh and you have to adapt different strategies depending on who you are facing. The mid-line invasion rule makes the games shorter and more intense and often result in heated battles around the chess boards mid-line. The game feels very balanced, there are no best or worst army.If you don't like chess or think you are bad at it I would still encourage you to try this game, I think it feels different enough that you might enjoy it even if you don't like normal chess. Also, if you are bad at chess you will feel right at home here, we are all starting from scratch and are trying to figure out how to play this game ;) However, I think you get better at normal chess by playing this game so this might be something for someone who want to get better at normal chess as well.If nothing else I would recommend this game so you can learn the rules and play it with a physical chess against your friends because it is a really fun chess variation when you get the hang of the new rules. I was quite skeptical in the beginning, especially about the bidding and the new armies but it actually works and fits really nice together. So do yourself a favor and try this strategy game, the worst thing that can happen is that you don't like it :)Rules:               9/10UI:                     6/10Fun factor:        9/10Options:            5/10Graphics:           10/10Music:                8/10Game modes:    6/10Army Balance:   9/10Score:                 8/10"

The overall idea is OK, but personally I don't like the betting stones for pieces thing, and I just wish I could turn it off and play `a piece captures a piece` (along with the music- I'm forced to play with no volume).The worst part is the AI. I read other reviews before purchasing and thought, OK the AI isn't great but it must be playable. Frankly, it isn't. Most games are won in very few moves and the AI is almost unresponsive to threats. Seriously, move a pawn out of the way and march your king/s across the midline, very minimal resistance will be offered, you will win.So with no viable AI, you will always need an online player.There's no 2 player option, so at the moment you can't play a friend or family member at home using the same computer. Why is this not an option? It seems like the basic option? Actually this is what tips me to not recommend it, because without this option, there's no viable way to play the game, which otherwise might be entertaining."

Second, the game freezes at times when I press the exit button, and I am required to shutdown the computer in order to move on.  Third, there is still a small number of users which means you cannot play a competitive game too often when you sign on.  Fourth, the lack of a player vs. computer mode makes the game virtually unusable if others are not available to play.  I would also like to see a way to easily pair up with your friends, a 2 player one screen mode, a way to chat as you play, and statistics such as win-loss record with each army.The visuals are solid, the gameplay is great, and I love the game Chess 2.

Want to practice against the more interesting teams? You'll have to find a real person for that.There are also no options in this game. You can't even lower the music. You need to mute the whole game if you want to listen to something else.This game really is the bare minimum. Despite the video game adaption being really mediocre, I'm still giving this a positive rating since the rules of Chess 2 are actually really cool and I want more people to start playing, whether it be through the video game or on a real Chess board. The Steam Version does the job, but you'll need to find another player.Search for ""Chess 2 Sequel Print and Play"" if you want to read the rules. You can play with a normal set."

Chess960 (or Fischer Random Chess) did this to a lesser extent, breaking only the hold of opening theory. This one goes a bit further, adding new sets of pieces, new rules of movement for each set or piece, new mechanics for capture and adding the new victory condition of the king crossing the middle line. From the prespective of a chess fan, this is mind expanding, and liberating. It remains to be seen if there will be opening books for the different chess sets and so on. So, IF you are interested, buy it and study the proposal. Think of the experience as an interactive book on chess variants.Be warned, however. The AI is very poor. You will probably be able to beat the game very soon on single player. And it doesn't contain or allow for a normal chess engine, so you can't play normal chess with this software (or any other of the many other chess variants out there, for that matter).

I recommend it to anyone who's ever seen even a little fun in classic Chess, and I especially recommend it to people who are frustrated that classic Chess proficiency relies too heavily on the memorization of optimal, routine movement patterns.With six perfectly balanced ""armies,"" including the classic set of pieces, as well as a couple new rules - dueling and victory by midline invasion - the strategic possibilities are too multitudinous to pre-plan your matches, requiring players to put more effort into getting into their opponent's heads.The five new armies are easy to learn and discovering their quirks is great fun. For instance, the Reapers have a Reaper Queen instead of the regular one that can teleport almost anywhere on the board but cannot threaten the King, while their Rooks are replaced with Ghosts that can also teleport anywhere but they can neither capture nor be captured (making them into the perfect blockers). You can actually play Chess 2 with an ordinary Chess board without needing any additional pieces (except stones for dueling)!"
