My only two complaints are the rather sterile level design and absence of musical background.Recommended for achievement hunters and curious explorers.Achievements:Estimated time for 100% completion: +20 minutesSingleplayer achievements: 1Multiplayer achievements: none"

As you go through this ""box"" like world you will discover more abilities to give you access to other sections of the box to find the 4 key items to beat the game. Wish it had more maps but for $1, totally got my money's worth!Rating 7/10"

,Recommended,314370,24150611,"Posted: 6 July, 2016",all,Apoch Weiss | Apochs.net,"**QUICK TOUGHTS**Boxlife is a short first person puzzle game in the same vein and stylistic approach as Fancy Skulls, the developer's previous creation. You're thrown into a large room 'Alice in Wonderland' style and are tasked with not only finding four glowing orbs to escape, but also some basic gaming features like jumping and croucing (which is replaced by shrinking), and even flying. The more you discover, the more orbs you find, as well as additional secrets (9 total at the time of writing this) that count towards the game's one and only achievement. It takes about 30 minutes to finish, maybe an hour without a guide (someone posted a completion video is posted in the guide to make it easier). For about a dollar, Boxlife is a decent time waster."

Playtime for first playthrough was about 22 Minutes, With Finding 4 of 7 of the hidden orbs.Like i said, Box Life won't change the Way you see computer Games forever, but it's fun and well worth the few Bucks.System Specs tend to Zero, so anyone with a Machine that is actually Plugged in should be able to play it.Definitely recommend for Fans of Puzzle, Platforming and Roguelike Games."

The aesthetic is a little bit disturbing, but really pleasant - almost cute. Physics and mechanics work fine. The gameplay is weird and it was enjoyable for a little game. I said ""little game"", but it is not a critiscism because those who like games in which all goals are completed in one hour could appreciate BoxLife. A really interesting project in a strange universe. It worths its price (0.49$ during the Black Friday). Thank you ++"

Absolutely terrible execution.[Spoilers for gameplay solutions? idk man, you wouldn't wanna play anyway]The game does a great job of giving you no idea where to go. The areas are simple, yes: random pillars that you need jump for, random dices(?) that you need to do everything else for, and glitchy mice holes, and some more i couldn't care less to forget- and i closed the game 30 seconds ago.Yes, the art on each ability block instantly explains to me what the ability does. I didn't misunderstand any of my abilites once, but the game frequently forgets to do the very simple task of letting you try the ability as you get it.Also, Some mechanics that aren't ablilities are disastrously introduced. Take for example the folating blocks that appear under you to make a path.The game basically makes that look like an incident, an escape pathway for an error, not a mechanic. This similar concept of blocks saving you like that appear in so many other puzzle plaatformers as rescue option, and are at least introduced somehow if not.A way to make this mechanic more fun is to make the tower wiht it have some sort of grid instead of floor that you can walk on, but as you walk on the grid, blocks appear under you. the grid continues  a bit after the tower to look ""nroken"" at the end, leading the player to explore that and understand a path is there.And aside of gameplay, let's talk colors.This game has the best particle effects I've seen in a while.  Theyr'e gorgeous really. But everything else, especially walls and floors, are in the color of a nausea induced chilli dog from sonic god damn boom stomach poisioning. horrible. the game feels so dark and ill, not even in a moody way, just in a ""I NEED TO SEE CORNERS"" look.Make particle effects part of more abilities. Make torches as beautiful as the trees (are those trees?). Make you double jump have a pink buble trail. And change the wlall palette to something I can look at.And.. make secrets more fun to earn. At least change the font of the question mark. Anything. Please.Also you can glitch out of literally 70% of the walls"

The secrets are tough, but not to the point you'll want to rip your eyelashes out.No, the graphics aren't cutting edge, and the powerups are kind of wonky, but I didn't encounter any game-breaking bugs, and for a 50 cent Unity game, that's surprising. It was playable, it challenged my brain at times, and it's really an okay game for the price point."

It has old-school graphics and no storyline, but it reminded me of a Super Mario 64 level, and I mean that in the best possible way. I loved the spacious feeling of carefully hopping around the narrow high places, and then the claustrophobic feeling of squeezing through tiny funhouse passages.The main downside is that it is a very short game. It took me under an hour to reach the end of the game. (Although there are also apparently 9 ""secrets"" hidden in the map, of which I only found 2, so there's potentially some more play time if you want to hunt those down.) But at least it's cheap."
