76561198042266743,Not Recommended,314380,11417113,"Posted: 26 July, 2014",all,ZhugeXinhua,"As someone obsessed with sandbox survival games, I really wanted to like this one. Unfortunately, broken gameplay, poor design decisions, and a buggy client make it really hard for me to recommend Lantern Forge in this stage of development. The game isn't marked as Early Access - it really should be, since very little about its gameplay or aesthetics feel polished enough to be a final released game.Essentially: Lantern Forge's combat system is crippled by its own controls on top of balance issues, while its survival aspect lacks challenge. The game has limited content to explore, and story-wise, the game provides no plot, no choices, and no sense of urgency to motivate me to keep advancing.Gameplay Problems:Movement issues: Controlling your character is awkward at best in both movement schemes. Mouse-based movement, which was the only form of movement available when I first wrote this review, was completely broken due to bad click detection (leading the character to start mining if you clicked anywhere near a rock), bad collision detection (getting stuck on thin trees that the character didn't seem to be anywhere near) and a complete absence of pathfinding (walking into a wall when a door is less than a block away).The devs later implemented a W-for-forward-movement-based-on-mouse-position movement scheme. Although it's *better*, it's only preferable in the same way that getting the flu is preferable to getting pneumonia, because in exchange for fixing the click detection and pathfinding issues, it hamstrings your ability to move effectively in combat. More on this in the next point.Combat, Part 1: All combat is click-based. You have to hold down the cursor over an enemy to continue attacking, but due to the poor implementation of click detection, it's trial and error to figure out where you should be clicking to actually hit an enemy, and good luck if the enemy is moving. Now recall that all movement is *also* mouse-based. Because you have to click on the enemy to attack, there's no way to strafe around and get into a better position without interrupting your attack. Playing as an archer or mage? Tough. You're going to start running towards the enemy anyway if you misclick, might as well as put on heavy armor.Combat, Part 2: Combat Mode and useless hotkeys make your combat skills painful to actually use. This game relies on the Diablo II control scheme, where left-click attacks and right-click uses a single registered skill; while you can register a skill to a hotkey, hitting that hotkey doesn't activate the skill - it just switches your right click. This was tolerable 10 years ago; it feels absurd today. Worse, you have to be in Combat Mode to even activate skills; if you're in Build Mode, which you will be for the majority of the game, right-click performs context-dependent actions on the surrounding landscape instead (building, farming, mining).In effect, to even use your character's skills instead of bashing enemies, you have to 1. make sure you're wielding a weapon and not just swinging your currently equipped tool, 2. make sure you're in combat mode, and 3. make sure your current right-click skill is actually usable by your equipped weapon type (so no bows for sword skills). This needs to happen every time you run into an enemy.Combat, Part 3: Enemies are both unbalanced and cheap. All melee enemies in the game rush you as soon as they enter the screen, as long as they have a path to you. The prevalence of mob spawners in this game means that's usually 3-4 enemies at once, and the problem with this is that at the same level as you, each enemy does about 5x the damage you do to it per hit, since all your weapons have absurdly low damage-per-hit (if high attack speed). Your character's regeneration rate is high, but not that high, and the lack of usable AoE skills in this game mean that while you bash ineffectually at one mob, three others are chewing on your face.(Knights, the ostensible melee class, have only 1 AoE skill which costs 50% of starting mana if you don't have any mana-boosting items. It's also based on your weapon's damage-per-hit... you can see the problem with this.)The end result of this is that when dungeon-delving, you'll usually be stuck grinding against enemies 5 levels below you because anything higher is too hard, and getting appropriately low-level equipment drops. This gets tedious rapidly, and the problem is this is the entirety of the game.Design Problems:1. All progression is grinding. Past the first two tiers of items (copper and iron), I realized there was absolutely nothing new that would be added by digging deeper and hunting for later tiers. No skills to unlock, no bosses, and no new mechanics, besides a numbers boost and even-more-absurdly-overpowered enemies. The game's complete lack of story or even a framing device just makes this worse, because while you *can* build your town and collect all the vendors, there's no reason to.2. Survival is a cakewalk. Once you have even a small-sized farm set up, the survival aspect of the game becomes trivial, and you can probably feed yourself entirely off wild respawning apple trees. Furthermore, there's zero consequences for dying that I've noticed besides moving to your spawn point, not even an item drop.Other Issues:1. Aesthetics and UI are poorly implemented. There's no minimap, with only a (x, y, z) numbers-based position marker indicating where you are, so good luck finding your way back if you get lost deep underground (or you could just die and respawn, but how cheap is that). The crafting window is difficult to navigate for several reasons, and shortcuts for moving items are not indicated in any documentation. There's also no way to remap controls.2. Bugs. I've crashed to desktop once, and noticed memory leaks in the form of slowdowns after a few hours. Background music seems to be buggy in that the daytime music starts playing at midnight instead of dawn, and every so often, a weapon you're trying to craft will spawn with 0 attack.I've come back to Lantern Forge twice since I first started, and each time it's disappointed me greatly with how little it's improved on what I'd think are fundamental problems. Although I'd have sincerely enjoyed this game with some fixes, I can't recommend it to anyone at this point in time."

You have to build tools from rocks and sticks, to quickly build a shelter before night falls. If you survive the night then it's off to gather raw materials, plant a garden, build work stations to craft clothes, weapons, armor, furnishings, ect. ect.A wonderfully huge open world sandbox of survival and exploration, above and below ground. Start out with nothing and build the the world to your liking. Highly recommended for play at your own pace crafters and world builders."
,Not Recommended,314380,12635722,"Posted: 25 October, 2014",all,Nanostrike,"I hate to write a bad review on this because the devs have obviously poured their heart and soul into this game.  But to be completely honest, it tries to emulate so many games that it doesn't know what it wants to be.  Basically you start in the woods with nothing and have to survive, build things, and explore dungeons.  Sounds good on paper, but all parts of it are bare-bones and nothing is really fleshed out.It doesn't focus on the survival like Don't StarveIt doesn't focus on the sandbox stuff like Minecraft/TerrariaIt doesn't focus on the dungeon-crawling like Torchlight/DiabloIt's got incomplete bits of all of those without specializing or expanding any of those and it ends up as kind of a bland, forgettable mess. It gives a bad impression right from the start with the controls. It has ""W"" moving you towards the cursor...but no full WASD controls, which it SORELY needs. Gathering resources has a pretty crazy range, so you'll find yourself chopping trees/grass/rocks from 10 feet away with the same bland animation, which makes it feel really bad as well.The survival aspects aren't challenging at all.  Night brings monsters, but you can easily craft a bed.  Once it's crafted, you just need to right clock and bam...no more night.  Food is insanely easy to craft as well.  There might as well not even be Hunger and Fatigue meters because they're ridiculously easy to get filled and move on. There's no point in the sandbox stuff because there's no multiplayer and thus no one to ever really see or use what you've built.And the dungeon crawler stuff is pretty limited to clunky-feeling combat in one of the 'big 3' paths of melee/ranged/magic, where splitting between them just hurts you in the long run.So in the end, it's really repetitive/grindy and I'd say avoid it, unfortunately."

Indie developer releases it way to early missing lots of features, and then abandones it when they realise they're not going to get rich off it. At least it didn't cost a lot, and it was fun for a few hours,  but ultimate a sad sad let down.I originally gave the game a positive review, but that was when we were promised the rest of the features. They probably could have retained community support by throwing out scraps like recolored new things to craft, or a few new monsters here and there. Instead it we got a ""we are walking away from it"" forum post by the Devs."

Game's got a lot of potential. But I'm kind of leery. After all, something similar happened with Towns, even down to the game is dead, game is back in dev. And we all know how that ended...(If you dont, you should before you even THINK of buying E. A.)So for now, the old review stays, with the caveat that I'm reserving judgement. But I'm going to be watching it again, hoping that I can actually recommend it. I want to like Lantern Forge. I really do.ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOWTL:DRSame old story: Game with a lot of potential gets abandoned because the devs lost interest or didnt make enough money or something, so they declared their unfinished buggy game ""finished"" and quit working on it.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++I bought this game last year. It showed a LOT of potential. It was fun for a bit too. Kind of like Dont Starve, but more RPGish.  I dont remember if it was officially Early Access, but it should have been because it was in a ""late beta"" is playable but kind of bare bones and needs some bug stomping and balancing and the devs promised more content.So I sat back and waited after playing for a bit and then getting frustrated and annoyed at the incompleteness. Seemed like it was worth waiting for.Until the Devs declared they didnt get enough sales so the game would no longer be updated because they had to get jobs and couldnt work on it full time.Then work on it part time? Nope. Its dead now.They couldnt even be arsed to finish their game, when its mostly complete and just needs some polishing."

I intend to update later after more game time and info*While Lantern Forge could certainly benefit from some fine tuning, especially with the UI, there are no gaping flaws or immersion breaking moments in the game.  This said it also lacks anything amazing enough to floor you.The framework of the game is built upon traditional rpg tropes.  You have familiar goblins and spider enemies who inhabit familiar procedural generated environments which you'll explore with one of three familiar hero archetypes that all work in a familiar fashion.One of Lantern Forge's more innovative and stronger experiences comes from your town.  The game itself puts you in the role of building it, or rather strongly suggests that you build one.  It gives you a lot of room to be creative, allowing you to either making your town a work of art with individual shops, gardens and style or a small functional space to cram everything you need into.  At the moment you don't need to worry about protecting your town, its simply there for you to gather and process loot.  There are a number of elements that work together well here, from making simple shops, trading with your merchants, farming crops, crafting and just decoration.  From your new town, the game allows you to decide if you want to gear up by hunting monsters and selling/buying loot from merchants or by gathering raw mats and crafting it yourself.  Both crafting and fighting generate exp to level and improve your load out.If you're not into it for the creativity or town building the game does offer traditional dungeon crawling.  You begin by building stairs down which generates a whole new underground map each level you explore and there’s nothing apparent limiting how many levels down you want to go at any time up to the cap of 90.  You do this again and again, every staircase down increases the difficulty and generating a whole new area with better loot and material.  Though each level is different they aren't very unique, you'll quickly find that if you've seen one level you've seen them all and it slowly becomes frustrating as each staircase adds one more load screen.  Although its a quick load, the number of staircases add up and it gets frustrating until you can get warp stones, after which it's not so bad.  Once you get there, if there are any surprises, boss fights, secrete treasures or other gems I've not found or heard of them, its simply another layer and load screen.  When you start to level up from the grind you'll have the option of the three traditional classes, melee guy, range guy, or magic guy with a sprinkling of an all encompassing utility option.  At first glance it doesn't seem like you'll want to mix builds as each 'class' lines up with one stat and one ability tree making cross classing a likely waste of potential.The interface is one of the weaker points.  It will take time to learn as it's not immediately intuitive and can be frustrating as you adjust to a lack of WASD for movement and a combat/build mode toggle.   The game relies strongly on the mouse for most things, the keyboard seeming to be more an after thought, the only keys used besides hotbar is shift which simply holds you in place for ranged attacks.  You'll need to slowly figure out how to navigate around obstacle with the mouse as your character sometimes isn't sure if he's walking, using a workbench, or punching something.  Once you figure out how to navigate around bushes and bodies it all starts to flow.Overall I do recommend this game because you're getting a 10$ game, not a 2$ + 'IOU for 8$ worth of content to come' game.  It's a collection of a lot of safe ideas mixed together rather well.  A very appealing art style, functional mechanics, and 'passable' UI.If I had any strong suggestions for the game it would be to dress up dungeon crawling a little.  Limit my ability to easily move between Z levels, make it feel like an achievement to progress further down and not just another loading screen.  Hide stuff in the dungeons, collectables, secrete rooms, rare monsters, most of all you can hide cool stuff I want to put in my town to show off.  Make me wonder what's lurking in the darkness, remove my ability to see whats there with better fog of war.  Currently its to easy to see dungeons or to see ores by scanning the darkness with my mouse, make it scary and not just risk management to explore."

All the stuff got a bunch of details for such a limited graphicengine, i really like the artwork.If you like this kind of games, or even if you used to, and feel fed up with them since a long time (like i did until this one), give it a try.The pricing is VERY fair, especially when you have a look on what kind of cheap, unfinished trash get sold here for 20, 30, 40+ euro in the last years. Be it ""early access"", some poorly reworked 10 years old stuff or whatever they throw at us these days.Usually you pay those 10 bucks to a big company for a pityful DLC that gives you half an hour of gameplay or a new outfit for your freaking pet.I wish the devs all the best for this project, not many indie-companies here deserves a little bit success as much as they do.(and ofc this wish is also selfinterest, for i would like to see how this game developes further)"

First the good: The combat is fun (although simple), and the RPG mechanics give it a little extra flavor that other similar games lack. Now, the bad.- There is only one surface level, so you can't build 2-story houses.- There's no reason to explore the surface. Anything you find there can be found underground. But the surface is featureless anyway. The only terrain feature is water, and it just acts like another tile type.- Farming is fairly useless, because you will always have plenty of food from killing enemies.- There may be 100 levels underground, but when they are all the same, what's the point? I've gotten down to about level 50, and haven't seen much different from the first 10 levels.- Combat isn't balanced, Mages will kill you a lot quicker than you can close on them.- Pathing is terrible. You character is constantly getting stuck on corners in the tunnels and on small trees on the surface.- No WASD movement. (Seriously guys?)- There's no reason to build a house. Monsters attack at night, but you can use a bed to instantly turn it to day time, so you never really have to face the night.So, that's my opinion. I hope the game gets better, because it is kind of charming, but right now I simply can't recommend it. This game really should have been labelled as early access."

True, has a few (rare) bugs here and there, nothing gamebreaking.Now, working in their free time after job, they just released a new update with optimization, some polish and a little more content. Great work and refreshing honesty.Build your base, farm a lot of different vegetables and herbs, fight a good bunch of monsters, explore different biomes, go down level after level to find ore and loot dungeons, level your character, choose your path: warrior, ranger or wizard, craft your own weapons and armor and, most important, don't forget to eat and to rest!A very beautiful survival game that is, in my opinion, a little gem and it gives more for less money.

It's a mixture of Harvest Moon with FATE and admittedly doesn't feel too good in both areas due to the numerous bugs I've encountered so far. One of the most prominent is the random times your character seems to be blurred out by a white block by equipping certain tools or armor. {For me, it was a copper axe, then copper greaves}. The game lacks any sort of tutorial and is a bit of a deep leap when trying to figure out how to begin unless you watch players on youtube. It does however boast a rich enviroment of building. The other thing that irks me about this game is  it feels as if the walls do not properly connect. Also, quite a few items boast no pictures in the inventory or play screen {Bricked Items, Iron Curiass}. This game needs a lot of spit and polish because I would recommend it to anyone because I've decently high standards when it comes to ""Role Playing Games"". The interesting thing about this game though, if you put up with the bugs, is the ability to build a town center you can teleport to, teleporters you can place underground, and merchant townspeople. The townspeople however do tend to overcharge. You can't sell most items for very much but it's still good to play around with. Not sure about the item refresh rate. I can't say I'd recommend it, at least not until it is a fair bit more stable as it also tends to crash randomly and for no reason. You lose large amounts of items in this fashion."

Yes, the devs sort of left us hanging and it hurts since the game is very fun and has a lot of potential to be something more, but the game you do get is very enjoyable and has a lot to do for that $10, and has replay value.The devs have also been poking around and patching a bit lately and have improved performance (one of my biggest negatives since changing z-levels was painfully long) and added some content.The characters are fun to play and build, there's several tiers of crafting, lots of gathering and building to do, lots of exploring of procedurelly generated open world/underground to do, several different types of biomes both above and below ground with a nice variety of mobs and content to experience.For the whopping $10 I think this game is definitely worth it - you can easily play enough hours - and have fun doing so - to make it (more than) worth the cost.  I feel some of the negative reviews are way, way, too over the top in criticizing what is a decently feature and content filled game for a low price.I could definitely come up with a list of other early access games or even released games that cost more money and/or were far more disappointing.  Some people just have too much time on their hands to troll and be negative and/or have ridiculous expectations for very low cost indie games.PS - I have over 46 hours played, mostly before recent patching.  The top negative review is by someone with 6 hours played and IMO it's kind of silly for someone to be complaining about a game being incomplete when they haven't played enough to complete what IS there."

I think their running old machines or something.The only problem I have with the game is it gets boring. Why Decorate my house and build really nice table sets if no one gets to see them? Also it's not very engaging after you figure the whole premise out.For ten dollars, it's an experince I'm glad I had.

The devs have furthermore stated that the game ""never quite got off the ground"" and thus they had to get ""real jobs"" and take a haitus from the game.That haitus then turned into a complete absence, only broken by their sudden return to post a community discussion thread asking players for suggestions for an upcoming update.  They returned exactly twice to that thread to reply; once to tell a player to hold shift while clicking left mouse button if they didn't want to move while collecting items or attacking enemies, and the second time to write a single sentence reply to another poster.

My playtime in this game is actually closer to 30 hrs, just not through steam, there are some AAA titles I've spent less time on than the 0.9hrs this game currently shows (which is why I now tend to wait for sales or until the price goes down cause it's ""old"", which in some cases is less then a month after release).If you like other sandbox titles you might like this one as well. It has some mechanisms (not all good) that I haven't seen in other games. The game play is pretty solid, although the tutorial is laughable (3 pages of minimal information), so you'll need to figure most things out yourself (some people actually like that anyways).

If you are too, and you grew up playing a lot of the old school PC rpgs, you will fall right in love with Lantern Forge. Don't get me wrong, gamers of all ages can find something to love about this game, but in my opinion it hearkens back to the days of yore. Those days of RPG classics such as Diablo, Diablo II, Ultima VII, Ultima Online, etc. It has taken elements of all those games and mixed them in a pot with Minecraft, Harvest Moon, Rune Factory, and Terraria to name a few.You can build a base/ house/ mansion/ entire town. You can build shops that will attract merchants to buy/sell. You can tame animals and keep them close to home so you can collect their furs to craft ever more supplies. You can grow crops of all different types, (there are a ton, and they all have different growth cycles). You can build stairs into the ground that will take you down into a dungeon that is might as well be infinitely huge. There are rare and unique weapons and armor. Hell, there are even rare and unique tools, which are what you use to till the land, cut down trees, mine ores, and harvest crops. It literally has elements of every cool RPG/survival sim/hack and slash/ dungeon crawler ever made. To avoid a massive wall of text, I'll stop there, (because I could go on.......and on).The graphics in the game aren't the greatest, but this is yet another case of content and gameplay > graphics. Let's face it, most mainstream games are all graphics and no content. They are like watching a movie rather than playing a game. That is why many people are turning to indie developers, and the developers of this game are great. You can really tell that they are fans of the games that inspired Lantern Forge. You can also tell that they are fans of their own game, because although their are some UI woes, everything is fully functional, fully immersive, and most of all, fully fun to play.I sincerely hope that this game catches more steam, (get it?) and that a ton of people purchase it, because I'd love to see it continue to get developed. Oh, I didn't even mention how every world is procedurally generated. That equals infinite replayability for a measly ten bucks.So to summarize my gaming brethren.....what are you waiting for? Show support for awesome indie games and buy this gem."
76561198058781212,Recommended,314380,11849163,"Posted: 24 August, 2014",all,Mobgrinder,"I want to rate this game as a ""maybe"" but Steam only offers the choices of ""yes"" or ""no"".  So I will recommend it as a ""yes"" with many caveats which you might want to read through before dropping your cash on the game right now.I play a lot of sandbox, city-building, and simulation games.  This one drew my attention as I was looking at the newly available games.I wanted to like this game.  I tried hard.  It's pretty, has enormous depth and goals which I have yet to achieve, and I'm sure a lot of re-playability.  But it has some flaws which prevent me from achieving happiness with this game, which made me quit earlier than I would have liked because they were so central to the game play experience.One, the lack of ability to rotate the perspective of the character, is fatal for me.  Once you put up walls, the only way to see behind them is to demolish the wall, build what you wanted to build, and then rebuild the wall and hope that the engine lets you put the wall back in the right place.  For example I built a fort with log walls and then wanted to build farms up close to the walls so as to utilize my available space.  I can't precisely place torches or other lighting sources on the inside of walls on the bottom part of the fort.  So, the southern walls of everything that gets built will not be able to be decorated.  It's probably a minor annoyance to some, but as a sandbox builder, I want that rotate control.Two, I somehow managed to zoom out.  Whatever controls I had hit in frustration to do so, I could never figure out how to recover as the in-game help was well, no help at all.  I had to delete that save game and rebuild.  Annoying.Three, no WASD support??  I finally figured out that I could hold down W and move the mouse to achieve some pathing, but that's a big red flag and terribly annoying.  The entire industry has already made us gamers accept WASD as the movement keys, and heck, my keyboard has 4 red WASD keys.  So don't make me learn a new interface.Four, no hotkeys?  See WASD above... lack of hotkeys (or at least the ability to find a hotkey reference) made this game very taxing to keep mousing around the user interface.  At least ""I"" for Inventory seemed to work just fine.Now, for the things I did like... bows.  Lots of food to find, grow, cook and eat.  Bunnies that drop furs that you can use to make fur clothing.  Grass beds in the beginning.  Apple trees that drop apples.  I like the rustic-ness one can achieve with all of the wood items and grass.  I like the feel of starting out as a hunter-gatherer and then moving into agriculture.  The ability to crate up tame animals and carry them back to base to release them (unlike another game which makes you lead the animals by taunting them with food).This game could be a 10 - but instead I have to call it a 6 or 7 overall.  Big, deep world, lots of things to do, but lacking fundamentals in terms of expected user interface.  These are the equivalent to me of having a spanking resume for a high-paying job but noticing as you sit down for the interview at the number one company in the world that your resume is filled with spelling, grammar and punctuation errors.I'd be willing to spend more time playing the game if these items were fixed in future patches."

Having the movement control be the same control used to mine objects was probably a very bad idea, and combined with a complete lack of pathing (you will have to manually click to get to a corner THEN go around it, otherwise your character tries to walk through a wall) and control can be frustrating. The lack of any real in game help is also frustrating.That said, if you can get use to the controls and get past the initial learning curve, the game is actually a great deal of fun. It plays like a mix of Minecraft and Diablo with the ability to set up a merchant right outside your front door thrown in. Getting your first real weapon is a pain, and until then you're stuck using your pick to fight off anything you encounter because you can't craft weapons without a workbench that requires copper to make, but once you have it and one or two levels the game is a tad overly easy. It is however still a lot of fun.I would recommend it to anyone who likes Minecraft and/or Terraria. The Diablo-esque aspect is fun but the overly easy combat and heavy emphasis on crafting makes the game less fun if you're expecting that sort of thing, especially early on. But it really shines as a Minecraft-like experience once you get past the terrible control scheme and complete lack of in-game tutorial to teach said controls. There is a help function but it only teaches the basics of crafting."

To start off this review is for the game as it is right now, ver. 1.04.To begin, the game reminds me of playing games like (the failure of a unfinished game) Towns or say Gnomoria but without the management of people and focused on your character alone.  You start out gathering sticks and stones and make your tools to go further with your Mining/Foraging to open up even more items to craft, etc etc.(as others have said it, think Minecraft/Terraria in an adventure/rpg style game)-----------------------------------------------------THE MAPThe world has some nice variety to it as it currently has 8 different areas in the world of Lantern Forge; Each having their own unique tilesets, trees, and plants that grow in those areas.-Grassland-Forest-Desert-Tundra-Swamp-Tropical-Graveyard-FairyAs you progress in the game you go further and further underground opening new levels to explore.-----------------------------------------------------THE SKILLS/COMBATSkills are divided into four classes and four tiers, you are not limited to putting points into one class but in order to invest points into a higher tier you will need to at lease invest 5 points in the tier below it in order to have access to it.Combat is fairly straight forward, left click enemy to attack it, hitting space bar swaps from COMBAT/CRAFTING mode with will open 4 slots for abilities from the talent tree (for whichever you choose)-----------------------------------------------------CRAFTING/BUILDINGRight now, crafting can seem a little confusing to some as the requirements for items will hopefully one day be clickable to see where and/or what you need to make the materials themselves, along with not knowing which crafting table you need in order to make the item(s).  Other than that it is perfectly fine and goes parallel with the new zones/levels of the map as you progress through the game.With the game you can also craft walls and such to make yourself a shelter, which is handy as right now as creatures cannot break in to attack you.------------------------------------------------------As with any EA game, there are bugs, but I have yet to run into one that hampered my game-play.  In the end I find this game more than worth the $10 price, as, depending on what you wanna do in it, you can easily play many hours out of the game.  As the game progresses through the patches I will update the review as anything notable is added.  In the end its up to you if you want to play this game, so look around and watch some game-play videos on YouTube to get an idea on it.GAME ON! :D"

The graphics are awesome, I loved the different biomes that made each game unique.There were minor bugs that were usually corrected by restarting the game.  Some gameplay issues I saw that would make things more enjoyable:1. Give us access to a starter weapon like a stone sword.  The first few minutes can be rough until you start mining and collect copper/copper forge.2. There's too much ground clutter.  You could cut the amount of rocks/twigs/trees by 75% and there would still be plenty. This would also encourage people to plant all those saplings that drop.3. Slow down the leveling process.  I found myself constantly fighting stuff way below my skill level by the time I got enough ore to create the next level pickaxe.  For example, a little while ago  I was level 14 and trying to scrape up enough iron to make an iron pickaxe.  Slow it down so we have time to explore each level, gear up, and be fighting mobs our own level.4. Portals.  I love the idea, but you have to mine down ten levels to get to the silver you need to create them.  That's a lot of load times.  Maybe make them accessable earlier in gameplay so by the time the player gets to level five and starts getting sick of the load screen, they have access to it?5. Loading map deaths.  Most of my deaths seem to occur when the game lags while loading a map.The above are little complaints.  I still recommend this game and can't wait to see what comes next."

The lovely art style and perfect overview of the isometric perspective is also very refreshing in a genre that is getting very saturated these days.

You can't stay in one place and grind out XP and materials. You have to explore for rare items, and you can't explore far/deep too quickly, or you get squished. Instead, you end up gradually expanding your base and tunnels, gathering materials, XP, and generally powering up at a nice rate. No grinding needed.- Building structurs is easy.- Crafting is straight forward but the UI could use some improvements. (you can't search for a list of items you have the ability to build)- Farming is simple and doesn't take an excessive amount of time. Leave your farm going while you adventure, and pick up more than enough food whenever you drop by your base.- No crashes (5 hours of gametime so far)The only thing this game needs is minions and town management, which is obviously not the direction they are going in, but still.

It's a typical RPG in many ways, but it has a fully developed food and hunger and farming that most games lack.  You can farm raw foods and then make cooked foods which restore your hunger.  The progression in the foods is done really well.  You can also craft potions - healing, mana and energy potions and others.  In addition to the potion crafting and food crafting, you can craft weapons, armor, socketable gems and random enchants.  You can also loot these items from monsters, but the crafting is well-implemented and easy to do and very deep.  There are many different biomes which hold different resources which gives a good reason to go exploring above ground.  Some of the biomes have been hard to find in order to get needed resources, but the developer has mentioned he will look into increasing certain biome spawns.My only gripe with this game is the movement.  It's ""point and click"" to move instead of wasd.  My hand does get tired of clicking, but the developer has mentioned that he will look into adding wasd movement.I think $10 is a very fair price on this little gem and will bring many hours of fun.

I used to play that game day after day for months because it was so easy to get into even if you just had a few minutes to play, yet so addictive you'd usually be there for hours.  There's something about the play and pacing that's just right.The part that's so much like Rogue is the multi-floor procedurally generated dungeon chock full of mobs, loot, and persistent modifiable terrain.  Rogue had more character customization, but in both games you may end up struggling a bit if you try to force the game to play in one certain way; instead if you step back and just think about what abilities and resources youdohave, you can sometimes discover to your delight a totally different way to play.What's been added to this formula is an equally engaging surface world to explore, and practically another full-blown game building things and leaving your mark on the world.  Here also you shouldn't let the limitations of other games trap you into thinking there's only one way to play, i.e. survive the night, build a shelter, find some food, start a farm, farm the farm, get some weapons and tools and start exploring the dungeon, blah, blah, blah.  Once you figure it out, you can skip farming if you want, and you don't even need to build shelter - you can live like a nomad and carry your camp with you.The game isn't without problems.  The pathfinding really needs some work, and the UI could use a lot of improvement.  The big issue for most people of course would be the crashes, and certainly these need to be fixed.   I've had a few dozen crashes so far myself, but it's only been a minor annoyance - restarting the game takes less than a minute and I find I've usually been rolled back no more than a minute or two of play.  Definitely a problem, but not enough to make me want to stop playing - I'm just having too much fun."

Functionality kind of a mix between Minecraft and Terraria. but with a better character class development.Probably my biggest compliant is that when you level, all surface creatures level at the same rate, so you can't really venture out at night without getting killed.  You should be able to survive on the surface at night easier as you level, allowing you to travel further distances from your bases without having to hunker down each night.

Once my mage got the ""fireball"" spell at lvl 10, I was easily able to solo monster camps.  Four monsters spawn, and they all die from the fireball.  This gives about half a level of exp, which rocketed me to lvl 40 very quickly.  Monsters scale to your level and so does their loot.  They were dropping copper gear (tier 2) at 10, but were quickly dropping the best gear in the game (tier 6, I believe) at 40.  I didn't need to mine or grind or craft any more.  There are 90 levels that you can dig down to, but I never needed to dig down more than 8.TL;DRIt is a fun crafter/sim game, but the balance is severely broken.  If you want to take your time with the game, then don't kill mobs outside.  Kill the mobs underground because they scale to level depth and not your level, but everything up top scales to your level and is too easy to kill with magic, which powerlevels you way beyond what you should be."

But wait...Pros:Farming: you can find, harvest and plant your own food, plants, trees for survival, build materials and profit.Building: You can build hundreds of items, such as a bed (which binds you to the bed's location), tools, weapons, armor, decorations, cookers, smelter, labs, workbenches, the list is almost endless!Fighting and Leveling: you can build weapons to fight mobs, roam throug dungeons, etc. You can level up with skill trees and stats (yes, its an RPG GAME WOOHOOO!!!!)Exploring: You can explore a vast, open world (yes, it has a border, but i haven't reached it yet) it has various biomes in one world (dessert, snow, tropics, fairy land, forests etc) you can walk for hours in one direction and not reach the edge.Shops and Buildings: You can build a town centre, shops, houses, paths etc.Enchanting and Potions: You can build enchantments and *sockets* for your armor and weapons, you can build potions to help you survive.Cons:I don't see these as Cons in a sense, but...Exploration: You can walk hours in one direction and not reache the resources you actually need (it is a randomised world each time)No Tutorial (as such): you come into the game completley *Naked* you don't know anything about it, most of it is trial and error/survive or die, although there is a *lip service* tutorial in the main menu.Random Mobs: The reason why this would be a con is because, when you start your first world, you might spawn right next to a bees nest, and die horribaly... Also, once you figure out how to build and use a staircase (going down) you might land right on top of a goblin barracks in the centre of a dungeon.Final thoughts:All in all, an amazing game, not many faults to it appart from those listed.If you don't like taking risks, there is always the demo on the dev's website, but please, please, please take the risk! you will be rewarded! :DPlease note: This game is still being updated and developed"

There are many tedious bugs and the gameplay/interface needs much work. I would be happy paying the price for the game if it was more refined and finished, but it does not currently feel like a finished product. I would expect to see a game at this stage offered as ""early access""."

And while the pathing is somewhat bad(getting stuck behind tree's is annoying),  it plays competently.The games simple,  there's little depth apart from go collect items to slay stronger creatures(which seem to the point I got to be the same creature with slightly different skins and higher level).  No story,  no plot or way to beat the game as far as I know...The game crashes every now and then,  and you end up going to the beginning of the dungeon floor whenever it does,  or I suppose your spawn point(bed) when outside of the dungeon.  This...  can get very tiring VERY quickly.  Oh,  and whatever you do,  DO NOT build your town in a place where the map loads...Overall,  I'd wait a spell for more bug fixes,  some more enemies/A Plot/story/ or agenda to accomplish,  and generally for it to be somewhat more expanded then this(if it ever is expanded on further).Or at very least a price drop,  its as I said,  not a TERRIBLE game..."

I played for awhile, my only thought was that it's a 2D knock-off of minecraft with a significantly worse interface and when it crashed and undid 20 minutes of my time I quit for good."

,Not Recommended,314380,18350374,"Posted: 5 October, 2015",all,Anfalas,"I bought this around August last year. It looked like such an amazing game. Crafting, village building and dungeon delving all in one! Who could refuse?The game itself is enjoyable, as long as you take it at face value. Controls are clunky and oftentimes unresponsive, however, many features that are supposed to be in the game do not in fact work, combat appears to be highly unbalanced, making the game a walk in the park, amongst other issues. On top of these, you'll often find the game crashing after a massive memory leak that hasn't been fixed since release.Keep these things in mind if you're looking to try the game out. For $10, it's not terrible - I got around 10 hours of enjoyment out of it, and I consider that acceptable.The sad part came when the updates stopped. For a full year, we waited, uselessly. Disappointed.I'm ecstatic that we do finally have an update (released September 6th this year), but devs? Don't leave it that long again. We all, with good reason, assumed you'd abandoned the game. Even if you can't release content, give us a short announcement to let us know you're still there, and haven't run off to Sweden to make a hefty deposit to a new bank account."

One of it's problems is trying to find base again after exploring, it tells you the coordinates, but it would be easier with a map with waypoints. Another problem is crops: it's sometimes hard to know when the plant is fully mature. Anyway, I rate it 8.5/10."

It's a building/survival type game that I'm glad I bought. The beginning was a bit clunky, but that's mostly because it doesn't use the usual control setups so the finger movements are unfamiliar. That's not neccesarily a bad thing, though. Once you get used to the controls, the game's great."
