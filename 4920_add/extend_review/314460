,Not Recommended,314460,12179637,"Posted: 21 September, 2014",all,Nahuta,"Opening statement: I have over 250 games owned on Steam (not including F2P games), and this is the only one worth a negative review out of all of them.  Before you waste your time with the ""helpful"" reviews, most of the ""helpful"" positive reviews for this game have very little time spent in the game, when one of the biggest detriments to this game is the completely repetitive nature of it.This is without a doubt one of the biggest disappointments for a smash bros type game I have ever seen.  There is no difference between any of the characters except how they look as the only thing you do is either jump or use a power-up.  There is no such thing as a ""move"" in this game, which is a complete insult to the genre.  Both the control scheme and combat are completely terrible, as even with the so-called jokes for ""power-ups"" the game devolves into who can jump better.What makes the awful control scheme even worse is the complete lack of any option to change it whatsoever.  Think of the game as Smash Bros with absolutely no moves, on items and jumping on your opponent's head.  The closest comparison I can make is Towerfall Ascension, only without the arrows or the map overlap.  The different game modes do nothing for the game either, as the gameplay does not change.  Yes, the game does offer a significant challenge, but it is completely repetitive and dumbs down the genre to such a point that takes the entire amount of fun out of it.The challenge mode is a joke, the first level is literally sitting in the top right corner waiting for enemies to jump into you.  90% of the strategy in this game is to get the high ground and camp it.  Even as you progress farther, it still remains exactly the same kind of thing, even though the maps and available power-ups will change.  Every single ""challenge"" comes down to the same thing: find the right way to cheese the map with the high ground and avoid getting spawn killed.For a genre that prides itself on having complexity of combat, this game is an utter disappointment from its incredibly dumbed down three-step approach: 1. Take the high ground. 2. Hold the high ground.  3. Win.TL;DR: If you're looking for a good smash bros type game on Steam, this is the opposite of what you want.  This game is a waste of money and a joke for the genre, as it is without a doubt the worst game of its type I have ever seen.  If you made the mistake of wasting your money, just idle to get the cards and never touch the game again.  I wasted more time than I should have on this piece of garbage to see if it would get any better as time went on... it only got worse."

Good to see it updated and finally on Steam :)I recommend it to anyone who loves epic and very fast-paced pvp/team arena battles.I also had a try at the solo challenge mode and had my♥♥♥♥♥kicked gloriously by the AI :)I loved the art style, the music and the characters designs and their special attacks are unique and well... really cool :DTo sum up, beautiful content, multiple game modes and it is pretty cheap... worth it"

It's really fun on the arena mode if you have a friend over or have a sibling you want to play it with. The challenge mode is really difficult but its good if your looking for a challenge.

Once they get over your head, it's pretty much over as they track your every move perfectly. The enemies are numerous and have you exact moves and abilities plus perfect computer precision and in the case of the first level if you do somehow manage to spam enough to get the boss to his last life (same as yours plus infinite minions) he just sits on your spawn in instakill mode until you fail. Fantastic art but it's completely wasted on this game, I'm really dissapointed with this."

,Recommended,314460,12080215,"Posted: 12 September, 2014",all,Yensets,"So I will start off by saying... This game is not online. Now that it's out of the way.. I can safely say i am a huge fan of this game. If your roommates/siblings or family or whatever want to join in, this game can be a great deal  of fun. I had a blast with this game. The new challenge mode is incredibly difficult, but that keeps you wanting more for hours on end. Level one is the hardest... but that makes it all the more satisfying. I have made a gameplay video if you would like to check it out for some confirmation of what you're getting in to...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r05dRXP-4vw&list=UUtDOPOGulrilq_jHndC7cVQ"

,Not Recommended,314460,12838387,"Posted: 7 November, 2014",all,Dragonite,"I want to like this game. I really do. But I just can't.First off, the mechanics. You jump on heads. Once in a while you get a power up that does one thing, or another. It's like a hyper-nerfed version of Smash Bros, with uninteresting blobs instead of the beloved Marios and Zeldas and Pikachus. I'm not lucky enough to have anyone to do local multiplayer with, and there is no online, and maybe singleplayer is just a really bad representation of what Jamsouls is, but a game centered around jumping on people just doesn't do it for me.Second off, difficulty is not something I often complain about in games, but this one's just too hard. It's hard to the point of just not fun. Think about the arcade games of the 80s, and multiply it by fifteen. It took me almost an hour to beat just the first level, and when I finally did there was next to no satisfaction. ""One down. Do I want to keep going? No, not really.""If you really, really, really like hard games where less than 10% of the players can be bothered to finish the first level, you might like this one. If you really, really like games where you mainly just jump on your friends' heads, you might like this one. Not a huge fan of either of those? Skip it."

Terribly over simplified and basic, ""How to play"" teaches you nothing, To my understanding so far the only difference between characters is how they look. Pretty much just a jumping game with horrid ""power ups"" if you can really call it that. Wouldn't recommend"

It has a very responsive AI that makes it almost impossible to kill the enemies and they kill you easily ,if you get frustrated very easily ,don't try buying this game ,but if your up to a challenge ,go ahead ,no one will stop you ,but be warned that this game will be hard,as,hell."

,Recommended,314460,11841314,"Posted: 23 August, 2014",all,Wenaptic,The game is fine. Should improve artificial intelligence in challenge mode. Must also balance levels of difficulty. Should be also add the possibility to configure the keyboard because the layout of the keys is uncomfortable.El juego está bien. Deben mejorar la inteligencia artificial en el modo desafío. Deben equilibrar los niveles de dificultad. También deben agregar la posibilidad de poder configurar el teclado porque la disposición de las teclas es incómoda.

I tried playing the first level in the solo game and couldn't even beat it because the AI is too unfair.Also, the gameplay is just jumping on people's heads..... and then you jump on more heads..... and then jump on more heads. That is the game. I think this game might have gotten the greenlight because the art is actually pretty good, but the game is complete trash."
