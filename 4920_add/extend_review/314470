76561198049313249,Recommended,314470,19348287,"Posted: 28 November, 2015",all,nerevarine,"What type of game is this?Summed up in one sentence:Retro-looking, Eye of the Beholder-style RPG 3D dungeon-maze-crawler with lite-puzzles, with a 2D world map to roam the world, semi-strategic map gameplay, treasure/loot-hunting, base-building, exploration, and multi-party/character building,If you like those elements in a game, then I recommend Heroes of a Broken Land.The game has a nice, simple intro, reminds me of the intros from the old games Overlord and Realms.It does a great job of setting the mood and tone of the game.Bleak, depressive, like glimmering sparkles lingering in space after an epic disaster.They look pretty, but how they got that way: just saddens; a constant reminder.The music is excellent in relegating you to this bleak setting.But in that glimmer, there is hope! Is there? Uh.IN GENERAL:Basically, you create parties of adventurers and take them out to different dungeons which you must clear of monsters.The game is very exploration-heavy. As you explore the surface world, you will encounter towns, huts, villages, dungeons, fortresses, all sorts of stuff, all sorts of random encounters, some that are text-based and you have to make some moral decision (or immoral, hahahah). Some quests will have some goal, like rescue someone, that sort of thing.You have a main base, which starts out with just your main party-gathering building, where NPCs will go to offer to join (for a price). You can build structures to support your overall adventuring, from merchant shops, alchemists, basically, places to buy gear and items you need to equip your party. Usually, basic stuff, since all the good stuff are random drops in dungeons.The game puts a lot of emphasis on building up parties and their characters. Everything is pretty basic and laid out.If you've played any RPG before, then it's familiar stuff. However, I really liked the multiple-party aspect of the game.You can spent a lot of time just messing around crafting your perfect group of heroes (up to 6 per party), and then have another ""line-up"" ready to go in case your ""main"" party gets wasted in a dungeon.Not only that, you can take multiple parties into a dungeon, in fact, some require you have at least 2 or 3 parties with you. I wish it was possible to merge into one giant party, like a ""raid"" party, but you can't, and instead, they roam separately in different areas, clearing out different levels.Still, it's cool being able to have more than one, it's like having armies at your command.You can send one group to deal with ""the big foozle"" in one area, and then maybe have another party go do a quest for some villagers. You can toggle between them with ease.PROS:All that stuff I just said.CONS:-The music, while excellent, is repetitive. I'd love to have more tunes, more varied. It's all sweeping, piano-focused tunes, and very well done. But even so, it's repetitive.-Not a big con, but the retro-graphics are pretty retro. My main issue with this, is I wish moving around on the main map was smoother. I don't think the party icon/movement graphics needed to look so cheap, since everything else looks good.-Dungeons can get to be a real chore, with constant back-tracking to find right switch that opens this/that door, or wait, was it that/this door? The game's in-game dungeon map that builds as you explore is very helpful for navigating fast and helps mitigate this by showing you the switches you found, and showing which doors are now open/closed. IMMENSELY HELPFUL. But tedious running around, just the same.TIPS/THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT:-The interface is a bit clunky, and can take time to get used to (like how to equip your party members with weapons/items). Really seems harder than it needs to be, but when you realize the concept of having multiple-parties, it makes sense. You can easily accidently sell or fail to equip good items.-Game has a bunch of settings to customize the game, so you can make it hard, easy, whatever. Tons of choices, from XP gain, strength of monsters, amount of treasure, etc. I recommend playing on easiest settings first to get a hang of the game.-Permadeath-sort-of: once someone in your party dies, unless you have a priest that knows Raise Dead, they are permanetly dead! So you can spend a lot of time building a kick-butt character and then suddenly lose them.If you lose all of your party, you start back at your base and can hire new heroes (you will reach of point of having multiple parties anyways).-Be prepared to spend a lot of time in maze-like dungeons killing stuff. Some dungeons are really large, and it will wear on you. You can always just leave though.-The developers are involved and make sure to do updates, the support is good.Final Thoughts:Great game, definitely recommended.I think some people will be turned off by how ""simple"" it is, how it lacks detail, and the retro-look.If you can get past that, like me, then you will get to enjoy all the depth it has underneath those things.For me, it gave a real sense of accomplisment when clearing out a dungeon, going back, growing my party, growing my base. I think if they tried to make this too complex, the whole concept wouldn't work.This is a rare type of game too, not too many like this around, so it's quite a novelty.LASTLY:The developers were awesome enough to continue the old time-honored/fading tradition of offering A GAME DEMO.Remember that? When demos were the thing?That was back in the day, when developers were proud of what they crafted, and were eager to show it off their beloved work in the form of a game demo.I think that the developer were willing to put out a demo, puts them in a very good light.How many games have we bought, where there was no demo, and turned out the game sucked?So don't take my word for it about this game, if you don't want to, you don't have to: go try the demo!I hope you enjoy it and reward the developers with a purchase like I did."

I was a little uncertain that it was a good choice because it's a bit pricier than I would have liked =) however;- It's really really fun- Keeping track of and micro-managing my party's gear was a bit tricky and time consuming, my only albeit minor gripehttp://youtu.be/ZZxvkvWs2yghttp://youtu.be/FNaKmguSPO4The world map you play on is randomly generated and you can adjust it's size and difficulty level when you start a new game. Initially hero stats are randomly generated. But you are able to choose the class for any level zero hero you recruit. I think it's best to choose a role which their stats most suit unless you really need a certain class. To begin with I took one of each class type. As your heroes gain experience by battling monsters and disarming traps they level up. Each level heroes gain attribute points which you can distribute into any primary statistic that you wish. I didn't stack these points into primary class attributes, I found that it was important to improve on the weaknesses of your heroes. For example sometimes I increased the defensive and evasive stats of my spell casters because they were really squishy instead improving their mana and spell power. Each level or so heroes also gain the choice of a new skill, the choices appear to be random. There are active abilities such as heal and passive stuff such as specific weapon specialties. Of course there are also different tiers of weapons and armor. Certain equipment can only be used by specific classes, some equipment is enchanted. Sometimes equipment provides a debuff (e.g. less health) as well as a benefit which have to consider, I like that sort of thing. The reason I found managing equipment a bit tricky and time consuming was that you have go to the town, see what's available in your shops, go out of the town, open your party screen, check what each of your heroes already has and then return to the shop in town while trying to remember what you needed. It's pretty typical sort stuff you see in RPG games. But I think it would handy if you had an overview screen so that you could just see quickly what everyone has equipped. So dungeons were really cool. It was easy to control movement and navigate them with the map. I liked combat, you can't select a target when you attack. heroes will attack the closest enemy to their portrait in the front line. Having your tanks at the front of your party didn't work to protect my weaker heroes as monsters appear to attack anyone in your party randomly. These aren't criticisms of the game I'm just saying how it is. One feature that I really liked about combat was that if you approach an enemy from the side or behind to initiate a battle it counts as flanking or a surprise attack. This allows you to take the first turn or even take two turns before the monsters retaliate. Dungeons are really fun to explore. It was cool to occasionally find a discreet switch on walls which open hidden passages. It's really satisfying to find a room filled with chests and crates of loot =)So yeah the presentation is really basic. But it just doesn't matter to me. I still really liked how the game looked. Especially the introduction which is a series of images explaining background of the world.So, I think this is a good game and I recommend trying it out. There are other games like this already out there but I haven’t played them all. So I unfortunately I cannot compare this to them to this. What I will say is that I think you could probably easily get your money's worth out of this title. After two hours I have only covered a relatively small area of the map."

But THIS is the game I'm playing non-stop.The graphics are from 1995, the music is repetitive, the gameplay is super simple, and it's so easy to raise dead characters that permadeath is more of a suggestion than a gameplay feature.But all of the procedurally generated stuff is great. The game doesn't starve you completely of gold, but you're really glad when you get it. The simplicity is perfect, because managing a lot of characters would get messy otherwise. And I'm not tired of the music. It blends in perfectly with the background and you don't notice or care about the repetition. You never get hit with cheap deaths, and there's some strategy involved with the combat, and strategically with party management. The graphics look dated, but unlike most new games with a graphical approach like this, HoBL takes itself seriously and doesn't hit you with immersion-breaking cheesy humor or lame mechanics.Just a great game. Especially if you're an older gamer like me that gets some nostalgia from this kind of atmosphere. I happened to buy it on a sale but even full price would have been well worth it."
76561198088899050,Recommended,314470,29133259,Posted: 8 January,all,ClawlessVictory,"It's a cross between Heroes of Might and Magic and any generic western gridder you can name.  It's an interesting mix of genres but it doesn't really bring anything else new to the table.  Town building is fairly basic and map exploration is mildly interesting.  The meat and potatoes of the game occurs when you send your parties into the various dungeons to slay creatures and find loot.  All of the dungeons seem to follow a similar pattern with switches that open locked doors, teleporters and traps, but their layouts are surprisingly well constructed leaving me to wonder if they're procedurally generated or not, which is an impressive feat.  Some dungeons even require multiple parties to complete, requiring you to switch back and forth between parties to unlock new areas in different locations.As far as character development goes, it's a generic affair with the usual suspects; fighers, priests, mages, rogues, etc. that gain skills as they level up.  Nothing terribly interesting.  Stats are quite simplistic as well, though there appears to be a nice variety of loot and spells to play around with.Overall, nothing special going on here but it does everything fairly well and the combination of genres proves to be quite addicting.  I can see myself sinking dozens of hours into it and it's certainly worth the price at 15 bucks."
,Recommended,314470,11603270,"Posted: 8 August, 2014",all,[Aerwulf] Krodan Aeron,"If you like first person dungeon crawl, this game absolutely fixes that itch. It touts itself as having a touch of city management and such, but that is absolutely not the point of this game. The randomized dungeons are large and fulfilling, and even on the standard normal difficulty it remains to be a challenge to overcome, that does not feel like artificial difficulty. The enemy types are slightly sparse, but otherwise the gameplay is top notch. One downside is that it is slightly clunky to cycle through your potions and skills, whether in combat or outside of it, but it has that retro charm to it, as most games that inspired this one felt that way anyways. This is an undeniable love letter to the classic dungeon crawl genre, and if you are a fan of those types of games, or even rogue-likes, this game is an invaluable addition to your library."
76561197976257424,Recommended,314470,24260692,"Posted: 11 July, 2016",all,Aramazon,"This game is suprisingly fun for how simplistic it is. It starts out fairly slow and seemingly dull, but suddenly you realize that there are all sorts of cool class promotions available, different hero types to recruit, different goals to aim for. It doesn't take long before you get lost in that old school vibe of trying to get better items, more gold, more experience, clearing out increasingly diffiicult dungeons.I can't explain it. If the combat had more complexity and there were a campaign mode it would easily be one of the best games of our time. It feels like a casual Eador for when you just don't want to worry about every little move."

Everytime I think, umm, this is going to be annoying, it isn't, they have thought of it and there is a great solution!!If you loved Eye of Beholder, Wizardry, and Dungeon Master, well BUY THIS GAME NOW!I thought I'd love the game but the whole having to backtrack out of dungeons would be annoying, but wait, you can move on the map!!! Dungeons are too simplistic... nope, they will have more levels and more complex designs as the game goes on.Then you get your mind blown.  MULTIPLE adventuring groups!!  What?  That can't be good, that's too much to keep track of.  NOPE!  Works beautifully!Towns!??  I don't want to manage a bunch of towns on top of this!  You don't have to, towns are the old Rogue style towns, except you decide what goes in them (buildings, level of buildings and what they have to offer, etc).  Only commodity in the game/town creation is the gold & crystals.  Both are found in dungeons or on the map.But wait!!  There are quests!  And then there are events!  I just accepted the risk of accepting an adventurer from a far land and WAHT!??  It's a freaking pixie!  And it gets especial powers like mana regeneration and the ability to use it's tiny size as a way to increase its evasive stat!  Can't use weapons but in addition to magic spells, has built in magical attacks!FREAKING AWESOME!!!My previous post had said that the my real gripe was the character portraits.  But after some searching, I found you can create a \Portrait directory and dump .png files (best with transparent backgrounds) and you get to choose your own pictures!  Better yet, what I Googled said they had to be 45x45 pixels.  NO!  It might depends on what resolution you run the game, but I have found no picture too huge.  Cut-outs work beautifully, like they were made for the game, with the class backgrounds showing through and spells, effects, and turns all working great with my favorite character portraits.My only wish is if would continue to update and add things, I'm not sure how long the novelty will last.  I mean I'm sure I'll paly this game over again several times, and I'd pay twice the price for it as it is, but continued expansion would be lovely."

I'm an old school games lover, I know the developpers wanted to make a game for nostalgic players, but this one is too... rough.+ It's a cute game, but...- Everything is random, there is no logic in character creation (every characteristic can reach 0 or 100%, so your characters are quite chimeric, not really sexy...)- Pixel art is not convincing, graphics and game play are quite poor. Monster design is terrible.- Game is very repetitve, as its cute but sad OST. Exploration and loot are not motivating.- Expensive for such low content.I gave up finally, spending too much of my time exploring, not really understanding where this game could bring me.(NB : I think pixel art should be used in a clever way. It should not be an excuse to put poor graphics and textures.)"

Great idea with having multiple parties vs always just being one. Great idea giving us sliders to things like game length and difficuly. Solid turn-based tactics.

I'll revisit this whenever I get the chance to play it.I'd like to recommend Heroes of a Broken Land as it is in many ways innovative, allowing you to create multiple parties with fun leveling mechanics in randomized dungeons with a pinch of city building thrown in.The big problem with this game is that there is no variety at all. You're thrown into a world with enless dungeons, but they all look the same, which would be forgivable if there was variation in the monsters you fight, but you will fight rats, bats, slimes, skeletons, and elementals over and over. Each encounter will be the same as the last, and it will all blur together in a forgettable experience, which is a shame because there is a lot to like but in the end I quickly found myself dreading heading back into another dungeon or, even worse, defending my city from endless hordes of very easy but time consuming to kill armies of rats and skeletons that roam the open world portion of the game."

Multiple hero parties and some dungeons even need multiple parties as each has to unlock areas for the others to continue to move further. Solid turn based combat with up to 6 heroes per party, or even 3-4 parties of heroes fighting one boss.It covers small amounts of town management with overmap strategies and a nice turn based combat/dungeon crawling experience. Huge amounts of weapons/armours/spells and items to equip and learn. Multiple classes to branch into as your heroes advance.A nice feature is that you can import your own portraits to replace the generic ones. You just need to create a 'Portraits' folder inside the game one, should look something like this depending on where you have steam installed.D:\Steam\steamapps\common\Heroes of a Broken Land\PortraitsInside here you place any .png image you want and the game recognises them, there appears to be no size limitation to what the game recognises, works great :) Side note steam screenshots are by default saved as PNG images, want your favourite skyrim hero leading the charge? Sure thing quick screenshot toss him in the folder and you got yourself a winner.To find the portraits ingame, just go to your adventurers guild (once purchased) and you can edit your heroes there.Personally I really like this feature.Summary.Replayability- Excellent, with fully randomised, worlds, town types, dungeons/caves/towers etc you keep getting drawn back in for another game, hour....what do you mean it's 4am.UI- Simple but effective. Easy to jump around and get to what you need, nice quick move feature inside dungeons too.Combat- Solid turn based party combatGeneral gameplay- Multiple parties, town management and good hero advancement systems with multiple class choices as they advance.Graphics- There are what they are, the gameplay more than makes up for the 'classic' look of the game. With being able to import your own hero portraits I find I don't even really notice them.I really recommend this game, I will continue to play it for a very long time yet, it's a nice time filler, easy to jump in and out of if you don't have long.If anyone needs assistance with setting up and using the portraits just PM me and I'll help as best I can."

How the implimented mechanics to make it simple yet complex with world building AND heroes esk map/town controll sold me on it. I was hyped and then I played it. But there is a few core game breaking issues.1. There are still bugs that are quite annoying. For example, I want to go to the next level of the dugeon and I click on the ladder. It doesn't happen and the ladder just wigs out. This alone wouldn't be so bad if it were not for #2.2. In other games it is really great when they include secret doors and pannels on the walls where you can find and get an extra reward. This game takes it too far. I have found 2 dungeons where I cannot complete in less than the two hours that I have played. Why? The answer is simple, secret doors. I have had 1 and then 3 monster groups left in the dungeon and I could not complete it, despite taking the time to look at every wall, click all around them, and take the time to do this.Making secret doors a required feature is a bad idea. An extra with bonuses can be great though. And of course it sucks when you open a secret door and find nothing.... but the main reason why I cannot recomend purchasing this game is point number 2. If 50% + of the game is in dungeons and you cannot solve them even by looking at each wall and spam clicking just in case.... it is broken. Imagine in heroes you being unable to flag mines, or playing a strategy game where you cannot get iron and you need iron in order to get units. Play the game without mines or units? kind of a core game mechanic issue.In short, this game has a great idea, great implimentation in almost every area except one major flaw. That flaw however is so huge that I cannot recommend this game to a single soul. It is a shame, I liked it a lot and would have loved to play it."

You have to judge which they will be be suited for and choose their class for them(on the level 1 characters anyway, there are also higher level recruits that have already settled into their role).I like the speed of the gameplay.

I'm currently running it on a Dell Insperon 9300 under Ubuntu MATE 16.04, and while it's a little slow, it doesn't need to be fast as it's all turn based unless you put it in auto mode. It's cross platform. I've got my game save folder in my Dropbox so theoretically, I should be able to continue my game no matter what machine or OS I'm on. The graphics are dated, but not horrible. It looks and feels like a game from the late 80's/early 90's and this is not a bad thing. Bottom line: It's a solid game that potentially offers maybe years of replay and entertainment.

He's been pretty good about keeping this game alive and kicking.If you like 90's-style roguelike maze explorers like the old Bard's Tale and Wizardy type games, you'll love this. HoaBL adds some features I've never seen in other 1st person roguelikes, including a dynamic overworld map with many features remniscent of Ultima's I-III or perhaps Heroes of Might & Magic. There is a mini-game in that you have to build buildings around your starting location and this helps determine your overall strategy.Perhaps most innovative is the introduction of multiple parties. You can make several parties and have them each exploring different places, and some higher level locations require you to actually bring more than one party together just to get the doors open.Very enjoyable and one of my favorite roguelikes on Steam. Worth every penny, and I look forward to more updates from the devs."

Resilience is mandatory, especially with huge maps the developers themselves call ""silly large"". The puzzles in the dungeons are extremely simple: Door locked, find switch. Or no automap, find and disable jammer.But you will find a lot of equipment, randomly generated like the dungeons. Your characters can be promoted. Oh, and you get sidequests all the time. Help a town and they will ally with you. Help a rivaling town and lose the first one.And don't forget: You can have up to six parties consisting of up to six characters. Some Main Quest dungeons can only be entered with more than one party. Yup, it's quite a lot of micromanagement.Also, the enemies aren't so nice to stay in one place; they will slowly march towards your town and damage your buildings or steal your gold. But don't lose heart: Unlike HoMM, you can pass through enemies.Just give it a try.Don't forget to feed the cat beforehand."

The game isn't perfect, so I'll do the flaws later but as it stands I LOVE how you can chose how the world generates, RNG and customize fans that enjoy a good dungeon romp, jump in!The graphics hit that sweet spot of being appreciable but also old school. Many games do this these days and I'm happy with that! The music that does exist in this game is good too! Has a very...""The world is over, we're just picking up the peices"" feeling to it. The sound effects match what happens and have an extra ""oomph"" to them! Well done!On to some minor flaws though!I found the music limiting, I want more tracks, more variety in music. Also I feel the enemy graphics are too small. I encountered bears that were a bit bigger than rats and the same height as skeletons my characters were fighting. My characters ""feel"" much bigger than the enemies. As if I was fighting teddy bears or smurf skeletons perhaps? Maybe make the enemies bigger if that's possible.

There were many things I couldn't figure out, and I didn't see a manual anywhere.

While I normally make the maps as large as possible a Normal size map is good. The game needs some refinement and alittle more depth.  Flavor text has goblins and dwarf locations and yet you have no interaction with any.  Your lizard characters, should you choose to have any in your party, only attack. Don't waste your time with spells or abilities as they do not use them and just auto attack. There is no need to really worry about your starting characters stats as there are plenty of dungeons with shrines to increase them.  Debufs are your frineds and probably one of the most useful spells in the game."
