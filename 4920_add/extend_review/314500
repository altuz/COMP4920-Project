76561198088720177,Recommended,314500,11935993,"Posted: 31 August, 2014",all,wills,"I'm an amateur photographer who primarily uses Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Photoshop for post.  Occasionally I'll use a standalone product for a specific effect, but I'd say 99% of my work is done in Lightroom/Photoshop.  I've been frustrated with many company's switch to subscription based products (like Adobe Creative Cloud and Microsoft Office 365), and have been looking for alternatives.Recently I have started using Darktable and Pixeluvo as Lightroom/Photoshop replacements and have found them to be very efficient and effective.  I can do post on hundreds of images quickly with excellent results and rarely find myself missing features of their more expensive competition.As for Pixeluvo, I really like the interface.  It is modern, fast and clean.  The dialog boxes for effects and such work extremely well and show very fast previews of what they will render.  It can also handle RAW files, which is a huge plus.  Basic photography workflow is typically opening, cropping/rotating, brightness/contrast, color saturation/temperature, resizing and sharpening for output.  While a digital asset management program like Lightroom or Darktable is engineered specifically for working with large numbers of digital photographs and are very efficient at doing so, image editing programs like Photoshop and Pixeluvo are essential for individual image manipulation, especially where more technical work needs to be done such as with layers and compositioning.I've only had one minor issue wth Pixeluvo on linux.  I'm currently running Linux Mint 17 Cinnamon 64bit and for some reason when opening images within Pixeluvo, the highlighted file selected in the open dialog dissappears while selected.  You can still open it, and if you mouse or keyboard to another file, it shows the previously selected file, but it is odd.  I contacted the developer and they promptly investigated and replied saying they could reproduce the bug and are now looking into it.  They said it was something specific to the Steam version as the standalone version did not show the same error.  They even gave me a new license key for the standalone version, and they were correct, the file open bug is absent.When traveling and editing photos, I like to take my Acer C720 Chromebook, which has a Haswell CPU and 4GB of memory.  The SSD has been upgraded to 128GB drive, and the ChromeOS replaced with Linux Mint.  For doing basic tasks, this very cheap computer with the SSD and running linux seems just as fast as my i5 an i7 systems.  Obviously it has its limitations, but for quick and dirty content creation is certainly can do the job.  Pixeluvo running on this system takes around 51MB of RAM and launches in around 2 seconds and uses 43.9MB of drive space.  Darktable also launches in about 2 seconds and uses 110MB of RAM and uses less than 1MB of drive space.  I do have Lightroom 5.2 and Photoshop CS6 installed on this system also with WINE and in comparison Photoshop launches in 8 seconds, uses 216MB of RAM and takes up 470MB of drive space, with Lightroom launching in 7 seconds, using 103MB of RAM and takes 920MB of drive space.  The well programmed Pixeluvo and Darktable are small, fast and efficient at their tasks with their expensive competition the opposite.I highly recommend this software."

If you're creating content for games or websites then you'll want to stick with PS or gIMP.  If you're a photographer looking for something with a small footprint that has all the image editing abilities of heavier weight programs with few of the features you likely won't even use, in a pay-for-it-once package, then this is a good solution.  Full RAW file support for those of us who like to shoot that way.It could use batch operations to process multiple images, but the developer seems responsive and open to feature requests."

After my motherboard died on my last computer, and I got a new one and upgraded to Windows 10, I found my copy of PS wouldn't work. And, since the lovely folks at Adobe won't give you free upgrades on software you've spent over $600 on, that meant purchasing a new one - for another $600. I said to hell with that, and searched on Steam for an alternative that still had a lot of the same features that PS had, but at a much more reasonable price. And I found...Pixeluvo.FANTASTIC software. FANTASTIC price. I have admittedly only used it so far for a few hours, but already I have picked up the basics and some advanced functionality of it (layers, layer masks, etc.) and edited a ton of photos using it. I can honestly say that the results are easily as good as I used to get with PS - can't tell the difference at all, and I get the same results I wanted but at a MUCH more reasonable price.This is very powerful software, that goes way beyond so many of the other photo-editing programs out there on the market that really are just a dime-a-dozen. I highly recommend this for anyone who can't afford (or doesn't want to pay for) the outrageous price that Adobe charges for PS, but still wants most - if not all - of the sophisticated and in-depth features that PS provides, at a fraction of the price. SO glad I found Pixeluvo - will be using it for all of my photo editing - both casual snapshots and my serious photography - from now on."

,Recommended,314500,33159534,Posted: 2 July,all,linuxpunk,"TLDR: If you are serious about photo editing or image creation, try theGNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP).It's way more powerful than Pixeluvo, opensource and free. If you just want to do amateur photo editing, or if you have a camera that takes RAW pictures and want to digitally develop them, Pixeluvo might be a good option for you.Long Review: Pixeluvo, not to bad, not to good eitherArguably, Adobe's Photoshop is the best image editing software, for a number of reasons, the main one being money: Adobe invest a lot of resources in making it's software powerful and (relatively) easy to use.However, Adobe's subscription policy is a big problem for me. Not being able to open your editable files unless you pay a rent is just unadmissible, as it makes Adobe virtually the owner of my work. That's why I migrated to GIMP a while back (and also tolinuxas my main OS).Sadly, GIMP has a number of shortcomings, like it's ugly GUI (fixable via themes) and it's color management. Specifically, GIMP doesn't do a good job managing color for print (CMYK). That's why I decided to try Pixeluvo.PixeluvoPixeluvo has a great GUI (that kind off resembles PS), a bunch of filters and RAW support. It's interface is amicable and easy to learn, and all the core tools for photo editing are here (levels, curves, saturation-color-balance, threshold, etc). It has non-destructive editing (which GIMP doesn't) and overall has a pleasant 'feel' to it.On the bad side, Pixeluvo is more gimped than the GIMP when it comes to color management (pun intended). Simply put, it doesn't. Not RGB nor CMYK, pixeluvo does not manage color profiles, which means that if you are not using your own RAW photos, you won't be seeing the 'right' color, which basically makes it unusable for professional graphic design or photo editing.Also, Pixeluvo not being open source makes it unable to use opensource third party plugins like the G'MIC project, which can be used in GIMP, Krita, Natron and other opensource software. So pixeluvo is unable to compete with other proprietary software feature wise (COREL, Adobe) and can't benefit from the opensource comunity.Why I recommend this softwareEase of use.Pleasant UI.Non-destructive editing.RAW support.Not to pricey if compared to PS.I bought this with a 70% discount. The software is not expensive considering it's features, but I woudn't buy at full price.I appreciate the GNU/Linux support"

Loving it :)Coming from a long history of using photoshop, this program was a breeze to get into. The vast majority of the tools I use in photoshop are present and working (layers, layer masks, adjustment layers, brightness/contrast, hue saturation, noise reduction, clone stamp, spot healing, etc. etc. etc.). Loads of effects and quick correction stuff to choose from making it also perfect for quick edits.It does take a little bit of getting used to how some of the tools react, as some of them behave slightly different than I was used to in photoshop, but everything does what it's supposed to do.You can't beat the functionality for the price and if you're looking for a quick, lightweight and inexpensive photo editing tool for retouching photos, creating thumbnails for videos or even creating some snazzy digital photo manipulation art on a budget, go for it."

It has been able to do everything I used to do in photoshop. 10/10! I really wish we could move artboard by holding space bar though... it'll take a while for habits to change xDD"
