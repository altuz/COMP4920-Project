,Recommended,314510,21207584,"Posted: 14 February, 2016",all,Faudraline,"Fall of the New Ageis a neat little game coming from Shaman Games, a promising Ukrainian HOG developer team that we already know from titles likeDreamscapesseries earlier last year. Originally developed for iOS systems, this game is a beautiful time kill for a tiresome after work evening when you'd prefer having some gaming time yet do not necessarily want to be heavy on the attention span.Our story takes place in a fictional Late Medieval - Early Renaissance period, where people start to leave old superstitions aside for the sake of science, logical thinking and societal progress. The death of the kingdom's benevolent king marks an ill omen for the future though: mysterious disappearances among orphaned children; raids on libraries, ateliers, workshops and academies; assaults on scientists, alchemists and philosophers begin. An ominous cult with the motto ""ignorance is power"" jeopardizes the promise and knowledge of the new age. Within all this chaos, Marla - a street urchin and a young thief - finds her young brother taken by the cult. With the aid of a swash-buckling mentor, Marla will try to stop conspiracies of the cult and find her brother by all means!I know, I know... HOGs carry a tendency to reinterpret classical tales, movies or successful video games in their own paces. Here, we have a simplified version of the originalThiefgame, with a tense dynamic between enlightenment and ignorance, plus political power plays on the side. Nope, that sincerely doesn't makeFall of the New Agea bad game at all. There isn't much depth to it surely, but it’s a fun time kill. You just have to be aware of your expectations about it.Artworks are alright, with suitably fitting medieval atmospheres and beautiful alchemical designs for puzzles. Character models and 3D animations work fine - even though characters themselves are nothing original. It was also a bonus that the game had somewhat decent voice acting. Esthetically, it is a decent game: not horrible, not spectacular either.The gameplay is completely different than what we'd be accustomed to as a HOG. The game carries HOG dynamics - like puzzles, item collection, environment interaction etc. - yet without much HOG gameplay actually. There are 4-5 scenes where you'll be expected to find some random symbols from a list for a password or some items scattered around which can be used as a costume for Marla, in her various disguises. It was refreshing to see a dynamic explanation and use for HOG sequences for the story. A cute and welcoming change, indeed.There are some reports for the Mac version not working properly - voice acting missing or item graphics not showing up properly - but I encountered no problems while playing this on Windows 7, so I cannot account for other systems. All in all, grab it on sale for a silent afternoon to have a decent time kill.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

A lot of the find-object/use-object tasks felt like the game was holding your hand and they didn't require a lot of thought...the hidden-object portions are ridiculously simple, and could be mostly solved with simple random clicking. Lock-picking amounts to finding the right angle, and holding the mouse there for a second, and then doing it again and again and again... not really difficult. Fully completed in roughly 3-4 hours without using any hints and taking my time.The final level of the game isn't actually obvious... you have to complete the story up to the final section, and then the game just abruptly stops with no solid conclusion. You go back to the main menu, and in the Extra's tab that's now open, there is an option to play the game, and that will start the final level... I'm not sure why they did this... I'm counting that as one of the game's more challenging puzzles.The game has interesting ideas, but it doesn't really challenge you at all beyond a few specific logic/game puzzles that can be beaten in a few attempts... that, or I've just played far too many of these games, and these puzzles all start to seem the same.Fun if you like these kinds of games, but I would wait for a sale... this is more of a rental or tablet/phone game."

Because it looked a bit like one of those find random objects in a pile of random objects games. But it is not like that at all. I was actually really impressed by this game. I haven't completed it yet, but I think I'm about a fifth of the way through judging by the page I'm up in the in game strategy guide.(I took down my videos on this game because the soundtrack matched 3rd part content =[... sucks because I really thought that this game was. I may publish new videos without the music turned off)Okay, I did actually come across a random object mini-game in this title. However it was an hour and a half into the game. The game actually has large variety interesting puzzles and mini-games and that was just one of them. I never found this game to be tedious or repetitive. The puzzles are actually pretty good. Most of them are relatively easy such as just finding the next object needed in the area. But there is a constant flow of them. Some of the stuff was cool. For instance in one part I had to disguise my female character as a male fisherman with a mustache which was amusing. That meant finding and gathering objects which I initially thought were random and then actually assembling them into a costume. I was really surprised to find myself doing that all of a sudden. It was really interesting. Also for a point and click adventure puzzle game it has pretty good features. Even though I hadn't found myself getting stuck for long at any time yet, you can request a hint which will highlight the next place you need to investigate and you can skip some puzzles. Use of hints has a cool down, so it doesn't allow you to rely on having the answers fed to you. Also the actual the in game strategy guide is a written document that explains how to complete every puzzle in the game, it even has highlighted screen shots. I thought thought this really thoughtful, in case you get really stuck. By the way there is actually three different difficulty settings to choose from when you begin the game. In harder difficulty you are unable to use hints as often or at all and interactive areas are not highlighted.Like I said the game looks like one of those random objects game in the screen shots. But as soon I started playing it things looked a lot better than I expected. It actually has a quite a bit of animation which seems to be devoid in certain random object games. I actually really liked the animations. The fact that there are actual animations when you use objects instead of just fading items in and out during scenes is a really nice touch. The scenes themselves look good. I thought the cut-scenes, characters and dialogue were good and interesting. However as usual with my ten second attention span I didn't really catch all of it. I do like story's premise though, a conspiracy by those in power to keep people in the dark ages. I also enjoyed the music.There were a lot of things that I enjoyed about this game. I was very surprised by it. I like how it gives a constant feed of mostly small but interesting puzzles. I liked how instead of having to constantly find random objects for no reason every object you found actually had a purpose and was tool to allow you to solve the next puzzle. I can't say for sure, but I think that you could probably get between five to ten hours of game-play out of this.Clickherefor more let’s play videos =)"

You also get animated cut-scenes! Everybody loves nice cutscenes. I'm surprised this game is so well priced. It's only 10 dollars for hours of play and awesome art. Like seriously, artists/animators did a great job on this game. If you like point and click just get it because it's pretty damn good. You will like it because how can you not? My only critique is that it ends abruptly which made me go wtf but then you have to select ""extras"" and it gives you one more arc to play with real ending! But I don't even want to complain because a game of this quality is basically a steal for this price."

,Recommended,314510,14389789,"Posted: 8 February, 2015",all,Lady Sketch,"This was a typical point and click, hidden object, and puzzle game.  I really enjoyed playing this game. Originally I had listed a problem that prevented me from completing the extras portion however, I realized that I missed one crucial element along the way. Once I did that, everything worked smoothly so it was not a game issue it was a user issue.I read several people having problems with this game in its beginning but I bought it recently and have had no game issues with it at all from start to finish. It appears all those issues have been resolved if your pc  meets the requirements of the game to begin with. The scenary is great with a good story line, I definitealy recommend playing this game if this type interests you at all."

Instead of inventory items, most of the time what appears in your inventory is a generic tool icon, a placeholder for the actual graphic of the item-- you know, the kind of thing that might exist during game development.  And constantly, and I do mean constantly, there are error logs that appear in the top third of the screen.If the game ran perfectly, I'd probably rate it around a 5/10.  There's no voice acting in cut scenes where it seems strange that there's not-- almost like it's another game error, but I assume it has more to do with game budget.  And the puzzles are incredibly simple and without any challenge.  There are hidden object type scenes where you need to pick up almost everything in the scene, so you could get 95% of the objects just by clicking around at everything on the screen.  The idea that you're trying to find items to use as part of a disguise is a pretty ingenious one, but the execution of that idea is badly done, and the ""hidden object"" part of it needs to be much improved.I would enjoy the game somewhat, despite it's simplicity, simply because I enjoy these types of games-- but the constant (although not game-breaking) bugs just suck all enjoyment out of the game.  The game does have a little character to it, and the backgrounds and environments are beautifully rendered.  But because of the bugs, I lower my score to a 2/10."

Generally it is a standard HOG game and good if you need some new game, but a lot of the mini games annoyed me more than entertained me. The story is  nice and I did enjoy it, still, I have mixed feelings. It is not bad, no, there are way worse games out there, but it is also not really good. I do recommend it, simply because we are always short of games in this genre and it will keep you going for a couple of hours. I played expert level and had wishes for the skip button with some of the puzzles. You cannot change it mid game."

This is inaccurate, It very much IS a hidden object game, with elements of a VERY handheld point and click adventure mixed in. Ed Wood level of voice acting, to boot. But if you like that sort of thing, have at it. I just didn't think it was worth 10 dollars. more like 2 dollars."

Frequent debug screens and placeholder graphics are riddled throughout the game. Debug code pops up and frame rates drop and game is unplayable. Only way to get out of this is to exit the game and avoid areas that triggered the debug code popups. The game is playable but I would not pay full price for this game. Buy it only when on significant discount and when you have nothing else to play.

The protangonist is refreshing (not a detective, yay!), and there are plenty of things to find and figure out .There are also some nice, unique puzzles. It ended abruptly, but it appears that the story continues on in the Bonus Game. I, however, could not play the bonus game. I bought the Mac version and the whole thing was severely glitchy. The Bonus was the glitchiest, of all,  so I couldn't complete it. I never would have continued  playing it had this been another game. But , let me tell you...the graphics, and story and uniqueness of it kept wanting me to continue. So, basically, I guess I'm saying that the overall high quality of this beautiful game kept me trying to complete it , despite having to constantly exit out of it to clear the glitches every few minutes. Having said that, perhaps it's just the Mac programming that causes all the glitches where it's almost unplayable, but if the PC version is smooth sailing, I HIGHLY recommend this one for puzzle game lovers. I hope you can enjoy it. It really is a well done, detailed beautiful game otherwise."
