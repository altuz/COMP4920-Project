76561197971843691,Not Recommended,314520,18855025,"Posted: 3 November, 2015",all,HexCaliber,"Broken, lacking depth, arcade rubbish. The words that spring to mind having now played 8 hrs since launch. That the developers have labelled this a simulation and imagine it is worthy as a release candidate beggars belief.Pick one of 4 rig types that you are limited to carrying when you are fishing, pick one of four baits that you are limited to carrying and that's your terminal tackle sorted, seriously? Where do I adjust boilie buoyancy, hair length, my shock leader, and link length, pick hook type and size independent of the chosen rig. Where are the method feeders, carp poles, marker floats, bait boats, baiting sticks, feeder rods. Where are the oils for soaking boilie's, the pva stringers and bags, and the selection of groundbaits and particles for the spod rod. Why the hell are worms, luncheon meat, casters and maggots awol in a fishing game that features roach bream, tench and carp. Where is the window dressing such as alternate clothing, bivvies, bite alarms, landing nets, et al. Everything I would expect to see at launch from a title labelled an accurate simulation of European Fishing.Then there are the game mechanics that are present but not working correctly, even the basics such as fish control and landing glitch frequently, fish that run for 20 meters under the bank, line retrieval that bears no relationship to what I am actually doing or seeing, fish that become stuck under the tip of my rod, fish ai that is unaffected by wind direction, then there are the constant stream of bites, how I wish that fishing for carp and cats was so easy irl.I could go on but if you do not have a clear picture of this title yet, there is little point.It clearly has potential, graphically it looks good, but as a simulation of angling it stinks, as a release candidate it stinks, it is just not good enough; at best it is a shallow, broken, arcade game."
,Recommended,314520,17492254,"Posted: 11 August, 2015",all,ben-c,"Ok, as a mature gamer and a UK course fisherman, i was intrigued the moment i saw this title. Mainly because it wasnt based on lure fishing for bass, which it seems 99% of fishing games are.  The first thing that struck me on playing it was the beautifull training lake, it was a while before i even cast a rod out as i was strolling round the lake in awe of the lush scenery. I struggled a bit at first with the fishing mechanics, but soon got used to it, and with practice it became very natural and pretty dam realistic. Im so glad i stuck with it for a couple of hours and got to grips with the controls, because now after several updates and much practice i am enjoying this game more than ever and would highly recommend it to anyone.The most impressive aspect of this project i feel, is the direction its heading in, although the updates arent super regular when the do hit they bring massive improvements and content. Phase 6 added a massive new lake, boss fish, landing net mechanics, a tackle shop and much more. All of the additions were well implemented and brought a lot more structure to the game. Unfortunatly i have now bought all the best tackle and saved up quite a bit of money for future tackle shop items. But the fact that its the first game i check everyday when im looking at whats been updated is testament to its genius. With the promise of Tench and float fishing equipment to come my mouth is watering!There are still some bugs of course as it is early access, but the devs are active enough and seem to be working on them. There is also online multiplyer now which works but is still very much in Alpha.I truly hope this gets the support and backing it deserves as it is, by far, the best fishing game ive ever played, already and theres still content to come. My advice to the devs on this one is please keep up the good work and keep heading in the direction your are... oh and hurry up with my Tench :POverall the good massively outweighs the bad and in my opinion is already a worthwile purchase."

Game mechanics feel good, though I feel like now I'm throwing so far I might hit mountains the far distance. I liked the triple spinning wheel bug as well, sadly it is going to be fixed.[Early Access - Phase 3] UPDATEWhat I like:- Casting is a lot easier. I didn't find myself trying over and over again to get a goot shot like in phase 1, and I didn't have to move mymouse all across the table (mouse mat was sufficient :)).- Improved visuals. Some of the things that annoyed me about the first release was some basic but unrealistic/immersion breaking visuals like a rope-thick line and a very wobbly fishing pole. These have been fixed now, at least to some extent. The line is pretty good, or perfect in terms of thickness now and the pole has just about the right stiffness to it. I still experience motor-boating and pole glitches kind of often, but the basics are a lot better.- Character feedback. Another issue I had that has now been improved on is the characters feedback to the force of the fish and so on, when you are fishing. It is very pleasing, and I didn't find my self getting thrown off by the characters reactions this time - big +.- New features. The fish variations are great and I managed to catch a few during my testing of the game. Leader boards are great. Adds a lot more to the game and actually makes it worthwhile to play the game in its current state. I didn't manage to go too far up the rankings but it was a lot more fun and exciting to catch something and see how far it will get you.What I could see improved:- The fish AI. It was a lot better than first time I played, but I still experienced fish going from 10-80yds in a matter of seconds when fishing from some spots (especially the little closed spot without a lot of room, had issues). The fish also seemed to not care about swimming through landscape as I frequently saw fish going directly throw rocks/trees and sometimes into the land/road/path on the other side of the lake.- The force on the pole when having a hook is ok, but the line is not always acting accordingly. I frequently experienced a pole arced and bent like a bow, while the line acted as is if no force at all was being aplied to it.What I didn't like:- Reeling/catching fish seems to be bugged sometimes as I have found myself reeling in for a solid 10 minutes two times in a row at the same fishing spot without anything major happening to the yard indicator/other. I frequently feel like having no idea whats going on underneath the water. Like if I'm catching a fish and it's almost in reach (5-10ish)yds I'm just able to keep reeling in without anything happening. The line should be rather short at that point, but it feels like it's extended by 100 miles underneath the water. Also while reeling, at times when I was not able to pull the fish towards me (maybe extended the line underneath the water) I was still able to steer the fish to the left or right which makes no sense. While reeling I often wondered if the game had bugged out, if I was doing something totally wrong etc. Didn't feel very responsive.I think the latest updates have been good and have improved the game in areas where improvement were needed, but some fundamentals are still flawed. Pleased with this update :)-----------------------------------[Early Access - Phase 1] ORIGINALI understand the game is in early access, but I just think it is lacking in too many aspects, and I think the developers should have waited a bit before releasing it to the public and accepting your money.What you get to see in this early access is basically a few tutorials and trials, so you can get a feel for how the game and the mechanics are going to be implemented. This is fine, it is content-wise what they claimed it to be. I would be satisfied with this amount of content, if it wasn't because of the bare basics of the game not being very well implemented at all yet. For a dedicated fishing simulator, it doesn't do a very good job at simulating what real fishing feels like. On top of that the mechanics felt clunky, the visuals didn't feel right and the main point of the game (fishing) felt really awkward, unreal and unresponsive.Problems with the visuals:- The fishing line looks thicker than the pole itself, and I know it has to be easy to see on screen but there has to be a better way. The line also seems a lot heavier than an actual line (which is as light as a snowflake flowing in the wind), when you look at how it reacts with the physics currently in the game.- The fishing pole looks way too rubbery/elastic compared to a real pole. Very wobly :). Like if you shake your hand a bit, it might go all bananes.- The tension on the fishing line is the worst part about the visual issues. Very immersion breaking. When I have a fish on the line, the string tension is very unrealistic. It doesn't matter if the fish is 40 yards away or 10 yards, if I'm reeling in or being idle, the string looks all the same. I get no real feel for how far away the fish is, how hard it is pulling and so on - other than the numbers I see on the screen. I found this to be very immersion breaking, it didn't feel at all like I was having a hook!Problems with the game (fishing).- When I'm reeling in I have no idea what is going on underneath the water. Sometimes I was reeling in for a long long while, but the yard indicator stayed the same, and there was no other visual feedback. I didn't know if the game had glitched out and my reeling didn't do anything, or if the fish had managed to extend my line by another 100 yeards underneath the water for me to reel in afterwards. I think it would be nice to get some sort of idea of how long your line is, and not just how far away the fish is. Because this just felt so weird when I couldn't feel the force in my pole, and just stood there reeling in for minutes from a minor hook.- The fish (1 kind in this early alpha) is very athletic, it goes from one end of the lake and back in a matter of seconds. It does this for a while, then suddenly stops. Like it spend all of its energy traveling so fast from one end of the lake to the other and then suddenly colapses. It also bites the hook very frequently, so the food must me scarse around this lake. :)- As mentioned earlier you get almost no visual feedback or cues from the fishing pole, the string or the fishing guy. When you get a hook the pole, string, and the guy - they all just act as if there was no force pulling in the other end of the line. In contrast to this, the fish is going crazy underneath the water as I mentioned earlier. It just feels so unrealistic and weird. This would be okay as a side game in GTA or something like that, but this coming from a dedicated fishing simulator was disappointing.Problems with the controls:- Something feels really awkward about the controls, I have a hard time pointing out exactly what is causing this.- I think one part is the mouse sensitivity. You turn very slowly while the pole is very wobly and when you throw the line out into the water I almost have to move my hand all across the desk to get a good shot.- The throwing part does not feel consistent. Sometimes I get a really nice shot, but the next time I do the eactly same movement (with minor differences ofc), the bait may end up only 11 yards away and in another direction. It just didn't feel right.All in all, I think the basic features should have been better implemented when releasing a paid early access of a dedicated fishing game with this amount of content. I don't see a point for anyone to get it yet, UNLESS you are very interested in fishing and can't wait to get a glimpse of what this new game will look like.[Deleted the last 5 paragraphs to make room for the phase 3 review update]."

,Recommended,314520,15073641,"Posted: 27 March, 2015",all,[FTG] Becky,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW BASED ON PHASE 4 RELEASE.Dovetail Games Fishing is one of those games that come to mind as unique. Or maybe even niche. Because the people who actually do fish, will be outside doing actual fishing. It makes you wonder why to even make a simulation based on it? Well to be fair to DTG, they hit the nail on the head. The game is still Early Access, so a lot of features of the game are unavailable, but as they develop it, you can really see the game shine through the cracks of it's early builds.The whole idea of fishing and just relaxing and enjoying doing something that doesn't require hard manual labour, is top notch. The game itself is based around a lake which you now, have complete control over. You can now walk and fish in different spots, you can now, change your lures, and you can even put your rod down!The attention to detail is amazing as the whole atmosphere projects a warm sunny summers day morning and the ambient sounds of birds chirping away to the splashing of over excited fish is simply sublime.To their advantage, is that the developers of the game at Dovetail, enjoy fishing and do it often. So the game is being made by fishers for fishers. I myself am not a fisher. But to play this game is to encapsulate what I do enjoy. A nice relaxing morning or afternoon in the middle of a green area.I would recommend this game based on ""Phase One"", and this review is based on ""Phase Four"". As such, I'm still going to recommend it. Quality. Absolute quality!"

,Recommended,314520,12792818,"Posted: 4 November, 2014",all,DatDudeCorks,"**Early Access Review Stage 1 (11/4/14)**Yea!-Realistic fishing game on PC-Looks Good-Great intro priceMeh!-Early Access/ early stage Alpha-Only 1 type of fish-Casting looks very promising-Could give something of a stats for fish when caughtBleh!-Menu is very clunky only works with keyboard-In game mouse sensitvity is awful-Tutorals need to be unlocked-Weird physics issues***Presentation-Game looks great for the stage the game is in, but there are some clipping issues with the water. But the fish and your model look pretty good overall. The water and reflections also are quite nice.The menu screen is barebone and only is navigated by keyboard. The options are barebone with only having settings for mouse sensitivity, audio levels, and Graphics detail (low,med,high,ultra), resolution with being able to select fullscreen, window or borderless window. Setting the game to fullscreen at 1440p would not display properly and only worked via windowed mode for me.Mechanics-Casting is decent once you get use to it, but suffers from mouse sensitivity issues where you have to turn it up a lot or you will be doing the picking up and dragging and repeat to start your backswing for casting. Sometimes even while releasing the line it will shoot forward then bounce back oddly. When the line is in the water it is pretty smooth sailing, and reeling in the fish is fun. I just wish upon landing the fish it would at least make up some numbers for you so you can keep trying for something other then landing another generic fish. Also be aware that the current plans is to only add in carp til a much later date.***Lowdown- As of this review the game is in very early alpha, but looks promising. With a great intro price of $7 ( which is said to increase as development continues), its a good time to buy to support pretty much the only modern realistic fishing game on steam or PC pretty much. This is only reason I recommend this game at this stage"

Graphically pleasing and with its current state and latest update its easy to hope in and play with friends and on your own. You can get stuck in and learn easy enough through a simple tutorial process after that its up to your style of fishing. While there are not a massive variety of fish species to be caught (something to be improved on?) what there is there proves a challenge to catch and some of the larger specimens are a great fight, the addition of boss fish and extensive tackle choice to unlock keeps you playing for a long time and the community online are a good bunch, never had any problems there.Had a lot of fun and hope it continues to be supported and more content gets added,  for me a good 8/10."

I actually expected a lot worse from the game and what people may not know is that the developers originally hinted that there would be only one type of fish in the release and everything else would be DLC. However they apparently changed their minds and put out a release version with a decent amount of content. I havent encountered any problems with the release version of the game and for anyone who thinks he might enjoy a fishing sim this is not a bad choice at all. My hopes are that the developers will continue to fine tune the game and I wouldnt even mind future DLC if the additional content is decent.Bottomline is a recommendation for anyone who doesnt expect call of duty - modern fishing.This is my first review and I am mostly writing it to balance the mixed reviews which I personally consider to be a bit unfair.

Game info and ads does can confuse users and the game is not really as big as it looks. The game is really Early Access the game.The game is on the one hand, therefore, difficult to evaluate and write reviews because the game is not really enough significant content, which could be something to say.The game is and looks promising, but the game missing a lot of things, what i like to see in this game. The game is not really any free-form fishing game such as Rapala Pro Fish game, even this game have ""Freeroam mode"".The game is on the other hand does work, but it should be much more greatly simplify the mechanics of the game, which would be more content and less visual beauty.More than that the game is like most of the cheap games, so on the desktop fish in the fishing game where you fish place.In the game there is only one game mode and one of the really small ""pond"" fish place and one fish species at this time.The player can not even change the place of the fish pond and walk freely in the environment. The game does not include a lake or sea fishing or even a motor boat rides.Also fish in artificial intelligence does not seem to be very good or even the environment seems to be enough interaction or vitalization and the environment there is not much else in life.The player can not change the gear or fishing supplies and the game will also be maybe possible to include additional content later on a charge even though the game may not be worth it.The game is missing a second over the fishing feeling, because the fishing area seems like it would be an empty place, and the game area seem plausible.In the game there is no other artificial intelligence fishermen, which would be a nice addition to the game, so the player is quite lonely when the game is also not have a multiplayer game mode.It is, frankly, this is a lightweight desktop fishing game. The game run the same as ice fishing or angling fishing, so this is not a hardcore fishing game.Sad to say also, that even the cat could cry this game, because the cat would not be able to fish the cats do not have enough fish to offer. x3I fear only that the game is going to be a long time Early Access the game, even years. Very few of the game is not over yet reached the level of the Early Acces. So the game can stay many players short-lived.I can recommend the game, but I would recommend the game actually later if the game actually add more content. :3//Ensimmäinen alpha julkaisu version arvostelu:FIN:Tyylikkäin ja realistisin kalastuspeli Steamissa, mutta...Peli on halpa, mutta todella vähän sisältöä. Pelin esittely ja mainokset hämäävät käyttäjää, eikä peli ole oikeastaan niin iso kuin miltä näyttää. Peli on siis todella Early Acces peli.Pelissä on siis toisaalta vaikea arvioida ja kirjoittaa arvostelua, koska pelissä ei ole oikeastaan riittävästi merkittävää sisältöä, josta voisi jotakin sanoa.Peli on ja näyttää lupaavalta, mutta pelistä puuttuu todella paljon asioita vielä, mitä itse haluasin nähdä pelissä olevan. Peli ei varsinaisesti ole mikään vapaa muotoinen kalastus peli kuten Rapala Pro Fish -peli.Peli on toisaalta ihan toimiva, mutta pitäisi paljon enemmän huomattavasti yksinkertaisemmasta peli mekaniikasta, jossa olisi enemmän sisältöä ja vähemmän visuaalista kauneutta.Enemmänkin peli on kuten useimmat halvat pelit niin, työpödältä kalastettava kalastus peli, jossa kalastetaan paikaltaan.Pelissä ei ole kuin yksi peli muoto oikeastaan ja yksi pieni ""lampi"" kalapaikka sekä yksi kala laji tällähetkellä. Pelaaja ei pysty myöskään vaihtamaan kala paikkaa lammella, eikä kävelemään vapaasti ympäristössä. Peli ei siis sisällä järvi tai meri kalastusta tai vaikkapa moottori veneellä ajelua.Pelaaja ei voi myöskään vaihtaa asusteita tai kalastustarvikkeita ja peli tulee myös ehkä mahdollisesti sisältämään myöhemmin maksullista lisäsisältöä vaikka peli ei välttämättä ole sen arvoinen.Myöskään kalojen tekoäly ei vaikuta kovinkaan hyvältä eikä edes ympäristössä tunnu riittävää vuorovaikutusta tai elävöitymistä sekä ympäristössä ei ole paljoa muuta elämää.Pelistä puuttuu toistaalta kalastus fiilis, koska kalastus alue tuntuu kuin se olisi tyhjään luotu, eikä peli alue tunnu uskottavalta.Pelissä ei ole myöskään muita tekoäly kalastajia, mitkä olisivat kiva lisä peliin, joten pelaaja on varsin yksinäinen kun pelissä ei ole myöskään moninpeliä.Kyseessä on suoraan sanoen, tämä on kevyt työpöytä kalastuspeli. Peli ajaa saman kuin pilkillä tai ongella kalastus, eli ei ole kyseessä hardcore kalastuspeli.Surullista sanoa myös, että jopa kissakin voisi itkeä tätä peliä, koska kissa ei voisi kalastaa kun kissalle ei ole riittävästi kalaa tarjota. x3Pelkäänpä vain, että peli tulee olemaan pitkään Early Access peli, jopa vuosia. Monikaan peli ei ole päässyt vieläkään yli Early Acces tasosta. Joten peli voi jäädä monella pelaajalla lyhyt ikäiseksi.Voin suositella peliä, mutta suosittelisin peliä varsinaisesti myöhemmin jos pelissä olisi oikeasti lisää sisältöä. :3"

76561198001790442,Recommended,314520,18979761,"Posted: 9 November, 2015",all,Sistermatic,"This is not going to show as an ""Early Access review"" but as far as I'm concerned it should be. DTG pushed the release on this (Nov 2), perhaps to try and counter Fishing Planet.It was a mistake because the bugs and problems with this are numerous.Some of the glaringly obvious:-- Fish that SLIDE sideways, they don't swim at all. Sure, their tails wag but that's the model, not the AI. They almost teleport they move so fast sometimes. Even the biggest fish around the 40kg mark, bounce and slide around like a Smartie in a blender. I've written script for fish and rotating them ""naturally"" is a pretty simple task. Adding proper inertia and momentum is a little trickier but certainly doable too.- The casting is not bad (with practise) but a 50m cast, to the opposite side of a lake, which looks to be 150-200m away, is up on the bank. 2 winds of the reel and you're back in the middle of the lake at 30m or so. In some cases you can't even see where your gear is until you bring it back to under 30m.- Reel winding is shocking. A 5:1 reel, with zero tension, should be bringing in close to a metre of line per turn. You can literally turn the handle 50 times and get back a metre of line. I made this observation in the forums and was told it's an ""audio"" problem because I mentioned I should at least be hearing the clutch slipping. Did they answer about not being able to wind in with zero tension or that my reel acts like it's  1:25 ratio?  Not even mentioned.- Fish snap off, for no reason, in some places on some maps. Can't even be bothered reporting it.- The fish ""fight"" is only really differentiated by time. A BIG fish in RL can and will run for 10's of metres non-stop, sheer power. Smaller fish dart and dance. Some of these 40kg monsters swim like a Goldfish and you get frustratingly stuck with a bouncing yo-yo fish, 7m out and 5m deep, going nowhere. Some smaller fish, where your breaking strain is 3 times that of fish, simply ""lock up"" 10m out and just pull against the line. You cannot wind them in, you have to pump and wind like it's a 10kg carp.- 15lb Touchdown line is borked. Unlimited drag. Max it to 100% and skulldrag your fish straight in. I mentioned this is a pretty serious exploit because XP and TP (the currency) is linked to catches. There are also live tournaments against real players and anyone NOT fishing 15lb will lose - obviously. Answer from devs. ""It's up to you if you use it or not"".- Tournament scores do not update in RT, in some cases not at all.- ""Boss"" fish are able to be caught one after another. I caught 5 in a row, from the same location, using the same gear, line, bait. everything.- My favourite. You can catch a ""Boss"" fish (all independently named) on Rod #1 and while you're taking it off the hook, Rod #2 goes off and presto..... same Boss fish. I've caught 3 in a row on this, others have caught the same Boss 5 times in a row.- FPS is capped at 30fps. Yes folks. UE4 engine, PC game, CAPPED at 30fps.- AMD users are suffering all kinds of glitching, gamma, flickering and crashes. Devs say it's AMD and/or Epic (UE4). Anyone who playes the multitude of UE4 games out there (Ark is one of the most popular) knows that AMD cards are NOT suffering this across the board.- VERY short gameplay. In 40 hours, much of it playing the broken tournaments, I am nearly maxed out and own almost everything.- The gear. Some of it is so similar (or lacking in gameplay neccessity) that it makes accumulation pointless. BUT, you need to buy item #1 to be able to buy item #2 so... accumulate you do.Look. I've had enough of this, I've annoyed myself, sounding all whiney and sooky. I could go on but just the attitudes of devs to problems you officially document is pretty poor. A whole lot of pseudo-surprise, ""we'll look into it"", ""our testing didn't do that""  etc... all the while telling you they're working on more content, and given it's Dovetail Games, it'll be mostly DLC.For now. IF it's on special it might be worth a look because they MAY address these issues. $20 for 40 hours is probably not too bad so I'll not complain too much more.IF this had been an Early Access title my review would be completely different and my tolerance for errors would be much, much higher. But when you release broken titles... Shame.5/10It get's an up.... Just. It is fishing, it's kinda relaxing and looks reasonable. It will be good for awhile but you'll run out of fun very quickly."

The game needs lots of extra A.I. and lots of different scenarios. Otherwise it will run straight into that deadly trap called Boring! Also fishing isn't just about Carp, there are a lot of other species out there, all needing different approaches  to catch them. By this I mean Float fishing, Fly fishing and Stalking to name but a few. The Graphics seem to be okay, but a bit on the basic side. I had everything maxed out and to be honest I didn't see any difference at all!I think that to Charge People for the ""Game"" at the moment is a BIG mistake! Get more into it then you can sell it for peoples hard earned cash. To actually sell it at this stage of it's development is rather cheeky to say the least!Finaly, I will recommend this game, but very reluctantly, as it has a lot of scope.

Casting took a bit of time to learn but not that hard. The baits that you carry with you in game do not hold their descriptions, only their name, so it is hard to remeber what hook it goes best with and what fish to target.The biggest killer for me was adding AUTO-NETTING. This took the thrill out of the game for me. Before auto-netting, I was able to really battle fish to the edge of the lake and then try and aim my net whilst tilting my rod. Had me in all sorts of weird positions haha but it was fun. I logged in today, noticed auto net feature, and had to wait several times with a fish at my feet and no way to net it because the games decided the fish was not ""tired"" enough. Now, the game is boring and repetitive.There was some resistance to the auto-net feature on the forums, and this was ignored by the developers. They should have allowed auto-netting as an OPTION, not as the only way to play. Well done devs, you killed this game for me. Do not bother buying if you want action, its no longer there.UPDATE 20/Oct/2016:After not receiving an answer on the forums about a possible re-implementation of the manual-netting option, I contacted the support team at DTG. Scott from DTG answered me quite quickly and was very professional. Unfortunately, it seems while the team is considering the re-introduction of this much needed game mechanic, there is nothing further to announce on the topic. This means I am shelving the game. Without the action and the thrill that manual-netting brings, I am afraid that no further updates will make a difference towards my enjoyment of the game. I would have liked to continue playing whilst other updates were being worked on, but there is no point if I cant have fun.This post is not meant to be inflammatory, it only aims to provide people who feel the same way an opportunity to think about whether or not this game is worth their money. If you enjoy a good arcade fishing game, then pick this up because you will get some enjoyment out of it. If you want a simulator that gives you more options rather than taking them away, perhaps you should wait until the manual-netting option is re-introduced and is set in stone, at which point my review of this game will be positive. If you find yourself getting bored really fast, chances are its the arcade style netting mechanic.As it stands I find myself getting increasingly frustrated when I have a tiny roach sitting at the edge of a lake, mean-mugging me and laughing at me, behind the safety of the auto-netting mechanic, while it builds mud castles at my feet before it gets tired enough for me to automatically pick up. It makes me feel like tenderly kissing it on the head before launching the little bas#%!$ across the water of the lake like a flatrock.In any case, I would once again like to thank Scott from DTG support for listening to my reasoning and getting back to me so quickly. If you are not getting any responses on the STEAM forum, give the support team a try, as they do listen and may be able to let you know how long you may be waiting before an aspect on the game you currently dislike may be rectified. So to conclude, if you are after a decent arcade fishing experience by all means pick this game up. If you think auto-netting will affect your enjoyment, wait until it manual-netting is re-introduced. It may take 6 months, a year, who knows really, but the game might be cheaper by then."

My PC isn't the greatest but it runs everything else fine. (Currently playing BF1)Had to refund the game when it crashed 5 times in 2 hrs.I might buy it again in the future if they ever patch it.

I knew nothing of fishing or it's intricacies until I ventured onto this game. My Husband and Son have been plaing this game for a while, and to be honest, it is great viewing as well as playing.But I wanted to have a go myself and see just what all the fishy fun was about. Cue my guy, Wilhelm. Wilhelm is going great guns. He has 3 rods; Kenny 'Fishing' Powers, Ray Bream-ero and Doug Heffer-Carp. The delight in pulling in a fish that takes a while to land is thrilling and just so satifying. An Acheivement that is as unexpected as it is awesome.So about the game; well, go through the tutorial or Acadamy to learn the basics- if you know nothing as I did then this is the  place where your fishy education begins. Then feel free to go and complete the challenges you have unlocked, or free fishing and just enjoy the game's beautiful ambience. The graphics, the fish detail, the weather, the sounds within this game are just fantastic. Immersive and peaceful. The gentle plopping of fish as they leap out of the water, or the sound of the wind as it begins to rise (shadow detail also shows the tree shadows moving in the wind) or the pitter patter of rain. I just simply love playing.There are levels to go up, a skill tree for tackle and bait. Earning Tackle Points as you catch fish, complete challenges and finish tournaments (the latter has either a live daily match or in game AI tournaments) means that you can develop your fisher-person to be the best in every field or go for one particular area of expertise.There is nothing quite like landing your first big carp, or first fish, but the ultimate (next to Boss Fish) is catching a HUGE Catfish!!!!Notes on gameplay: -* Have patience. Learn the tension gradients that are applicable to your tackle- losing a fish that you have spent 5 minutes reeling in only for it to get away can be gutting. Learn your rod's capability* Equip your net at 4yrds or less to get the instant land- anything above 4 and you wont be able to manouvre the net to catch the fish.* Screenshots are addictive- But awesome to show off those catches that made you feel proud. Please do take a peek at mine if you would like to see the look of the fish.* Character choice is limited- but there is no need to have a full on customisation option when all you see mostly is the back of your character.* Learn about the rigs, the best bait for that rig and go fishing where the fish you want to catch hang out.* Read the Boss Fish Menu and descriptions they are awesome* Don't be disheartened Rome wasn't built in a day and neither is the best tacklebox- take your time and have fun with the game.* Make as many fish related puns as you can- this is a source of never ending amusment. Life is but a Bream :-)* Slow life down for an hour! Take the small joy of a days fishing and be at peace. No traffic, no bosses moaning, no stress- just one rod at a time, one fishy at a timeEnjoy and 'Carp-i' Diem ;-PAngelDelight81 xx"

I bought it during EA with the assumption that the game was going to be improved by leaps and bounds. This is not the case at all with very minimal gameplay updates in my opinion. Sega Bass Fishing type games were more arcadey, but had heaps more depth and appeal than this game does. It is a shame because I was really hyped for a great fishing simulation experience that was advertised. Avoid this one is my conclusion.. doesn't look like it will ever get anywhere near good."

A lot of apologies for not keeping the community up to date and the threadbare team that has 3 platforms to work across. My heart bleeds. ( Don't bite off more than you can chew). It is a very basic game with a casting the tackle to the water module that you would need a university degree to understand what the hell posessed them to make it so difficult.The idea of hooking a fish no matter what size it is and watching it fall asleep half way across the lake also nulifies any reality as does the use of bubble Icons to tell you what the lake bed looks like,that you actually have a fish on the line!(err my rods bent and a fish is taking line I think I grasped the point I have hooked a fish). Casting your bait too a spot you want it to be at and then watch the bait move all on its own from 30 yards to under your feet or the line just suddenly goes slack.Float fishing where your told on every strike weather it was a good one a poor one or a miss. Depending on which one you get allocated  lessens or enhances the chances of landing the fish. (total nonsense). I know it always feels like a hate on DTG post but it really isn't as all the glitches could be fixed. But the game is very very arcadey and it really is a very poor title. But the most over-riding factor for me is the total lack of engagement from the development team to its community. It sux and badly. No excuse for not talking to people for over a year other than to say we are listening.(guess what so is ET). This team are nothing but liars and bleeding hearts. If there was an award for excuses and hard lkluck stories this lot would win a gold medal.We are now over a year on since any update of fix was made. 25th july to my amazement came an anouncement new update and fixes to all our concerns. Well as you can imagine I nearly fell over my rod bag running for the bankside :)So I looked around and didn't see anything that I would call different. I cast my rods and watched my bait crawl along the bottom like it had been abducted by a crayfish so no change there. The only thing in the entire bug fix list that was addressed was the fish don't fall asleep half way across the lake anymore. In fact your lucky if they give up at all.We were also promised a new free lake that was in creation before the dawning of man ! and guess what? We got the new lake or rather a reskinned lake with all the same fish as we already have with all the same bugs and this bit really bites. You can access this new (non wonder) for £8.99 in a DLC pack.  Seriously a game that is totally broken run by liars and now trying to cash cow it as a way of reclaiming some lost revenue after putting too many thumbs in too many pies.All in all the game should be removed from steam and DTG should stick to trains ( I bet they don't run on time ) :)"

Obviously some things need to be fixed, and added for this to be a decent fishing simulator.  I would expect setting the hook, casting baits as a bare minimum.  The reason I've given up on the game?  Casting sucks.  They have this free casting mode where you wildly swing your mouse backwards and forward and cross your fingers that its a good cast.  Its pathetic.  I understand its about timing, but the game is so choppy that the timing is probably being thrown off.  This combined with the 3rd person at a random angle POV, means you can't aim properly.  I would say 1/10 casts goes where you want it to go.  Maybe 3/10 are ""acceptable"" and you just leave it where it landed.  For free fishing and tourneys--no problem, but if you do any of the challenges, its simply impossible.  I would say remove the challenges until you fix the mechanics of your game.

Buy this game now at your own risk, if you want a fishing experience for the time being play fishing planet, its free and gets regular patches/updates.I want to like this game and it DOES have some good points but the fact that its such a limited experience and the fishing mechanics are so disappointing make me regret buying this game, should have thrown the money at Fishing Planet instead.This title is at a crossroad, get DLC greedy and watch this game be niche at best. All it will take is fishing planet to drop some European fishing locations and you guys will be in trouble, unless ofcourse you manage to dupe more ppl at the steam store."

However what is available right now seems to be running pretty smooth.  Its a lot of fun to wrestle the fish once it is caught, the graphics right now are pretty decent, the skill level required right now makes it a bit too easy but hopefully that will change over time.  I cant recommend this game in its current state.  I would wait until its full release before purchasing it.With all that being said my only fear is that this game will be a play to win type of game.  If you want to catch that bigger fish then you're going to need to spend real money to get that tougher fishing line and so on and so forth.

But it keeps me playing so it's doing something right. The fishing is much more real than most ""sim"" games that are mainly arcadish style fishing, which is fun. I myself wanted something more real, and this is it for the price you can not really beat it. A lot of reels/rods/baits/line/rigs you can unlock (ingame monies that is free not microtrans at all so you don't have to worry about that. The graphics are pretty good for most sims, they could be better but like I said they do still do updates which is awesome so it could change. The physics are pretty good, need slight weaking, and like lines bug out some and not snag/break really really fast randomly(that is very very rare though). But all in all I would say if you want a good fish sim you could play with yourself, or friends online get this. For the price it's a steal even at 19.99usd, I got it when it was EA so it was like 8. I tried many fishing sims, and most either tried to hard to be complex, or were way too simple, this one is about right.

All of these games get something right and all have something that a fishing game ought to have, whether its variety, casting ability, lure working, bait presentation rig set up etc. And all of them have something wanting. But what makes Euro Fishing stand out is it has nothing to add, it is a poor version of the free to play Fishing Planet. Dovetails graphics are similar to Fishing Planet with the added bonus of in game mechanical difficulties- Casting. Unless your running a gaming laptop your going to have problems with this game, there are known issues with casting. Dovetail have released an update which is an additional basic casting system.....but using this you cannot cast as far anyway. So its not really a fix, or solution but barely makes the game playable. With 8 GB ram , over 500 MB a modest processor , i had to reduce the graphics to the point that text was no longer readable to play to enable a grand success of a cast from 3yrds to 8yrds. Dovetail needs to double check there own research, casting in fishing is really not that difficult, ask any angler, to finnese it to a fine art is difficult but 8 year olds are quite happy casting from the get go.All in all Dovetail have established themselves as a poor game developer with this title, in future beware Dovetail for they know not what they do."

It's literally a run every 10 seconds. Because of this, there's no 'strategy' required at all. Just turn up to any water and flick just one rod out and catch constantly until your bored (5-10 minutes), and then quit. Even using 18mm baits with size 6 hooks doesn't seem to slow the catch-rate.- There needs to be a catapult/ bait boat option AND a way to select the bait your sending out.If these issues are sorted that would be fantastic."

,Recommended,314520,29700867,Posted: 4 February,all,WyattDurp,"I was a little apprehensive buying this game, due to the reviews, but I'm glad I gave it a shot.  Haven't had a single crash or glitch since I've been playing.Overall, this game scratches the fishing sim itch very well. Haven't had this much fun since the original Trophy Bass from Sierra back in the day. The tackle machanics are simple and it's easy to gain the tackle points to unlock the gear you want to specifically target fish. The dynamic weather and changes in fishing pace really add some depth: you're not going to be catching them quickly all the time, and you have to consider what's in your tackle box and your surroundings.Landing a fish is fairly straightforward, and I think that's been my only real disappointment. After a while, the bigger fish will just give up and swim straight to you, so I imagine tweaking the AI would be needed to fix that. Catching a 40lb carp or 60lb catfish should involve more than just holding the rod tip high and keeping the reel button pressed down.Casting seems to be another bone of contention with a lot of folks. Give yourself the time to learn it and it's easy. If you can crank up your mouse sensitivity, it helps a lot. Between the short, flipping casts and the long casts, you can cover any  area you want to near the peg you're fishing.A few tips if you find yourself stuck with some of the common problems:-You can't select a rod, change rig or put your rod down unless you're standing close to the edge of the peg-If progression seems slow, try free fishing at some of the later-stage lakes. The individual fish can make you way more tackle points than a tourney-Casting just takes practice. Don't get frustrated, make sure you're not underneath trees or in an area where you're constantly hitting the opposite bank-This game is somewhat resource intensive, keep that in mind if you're on an older PC. Might need to adjust a few things for smooth framerateIf you're looking for a fishing game, this one is hard to beat currently. It's relaxing, enjoyable and definitely exciting when it needs to be."

I am liking the game a lot.  It is relaxing and I like how you can do all the fishing with just your mouse.  Several control aspects of fishing are covered.  The mechanics are well done, and it takes a while before you learn the tricks to pull a carp out of the lake.I'm not the Steam expert, but this, imo, is definetly one of the best deals I know of on Steam before the Christmas 2014 sale hits.  So make some room on your desk and fish using your mouse.My review is good for the Nov 11, 2014 version of the game for $8.

If I have to compare this game with the others from the past, this work is the most definitive masterpiece from all times. It aims for the relaxing side of lakeside amusement. No need to reel in to catch  your bass or pike, just use your wits to select your most effective rig, choose your most attracting bait, make a precise throw and wait for the bite. If everything's in harmony, you don't have to wait too long. The bite alarm will go off, and there you go... The fish fights, kicks, struggles as long as her energy keeps her moving. Is she big? Well mate, she will make you sweat because the rod behaviour and the the line tension are as realistic as in real life. It's not a rare thing, when you fight with the fish for 20 or 30 minutes. Keep the tension downs for a sec and off she goes... Your fish swims away like a lightening, and you stare at your empty hook thinking: ""How's that possible?"" On the other hand. If you're the better one: your catch tires out, lying exhausted on top of the water , you're still have to use your net to catch you prey. One wrong move, and the sleeping beauty awakes and off the hook... In short terms: This game is awesome, even, if it's in early acces stage. I just can't do anything else, only to recommend it!"

You can't view the whole of your 80lb+ beast!Overall: Very nice game, developers need to patch bugs and chrashes but other than that it is a pleasure to play, I hope one day new species and lakes will be added as well as new tackle and matches. I rate the game a 7.3/10 after 40 odd hours it is a little bit repetaive but if you want a queit relaxing game to play Euro Fishing is one of the best. Don't expext a action packed non-stop simulator as there will never be a good one."

For no reason your line will just snap. Even when theres no drag!They never fixed it after they introduced this.So I recall some idiots posted how easy the game was, so this was there heavy handed patch response to make it harder, but it only ended up breaking the game so it pis-sed off more people than the people that first complained (that should have been ignored) .. then what people were playing it... left.Yep.. and they never changed it back.A dev asked me about it on the forums, though im not sure why becuase if you just play the game it will happen to you.Well, to help them out and as i was requested, i even posted two different youtube videos of it happening to show them it happeing over and over and over.I had lots of replys on the videos of people agreeing it also happening to them.They still never fixed it. Nothing was ever done. After two more months i finally uninstalled the game.I keep looking to see if they fix it on the forums, but nope.This isnt something recent, so thats why im being very harsh about it.Notice my last post about the game being broken in the comments below was in august of 2016!If they ever actually bother to fix this ill change this review and even reinstall/support the game again.

Players are saying that the controls are whack but I just dont see it. Its supposed to be challenging and just one of those things that you have to master before you throw a perfect cast every time. I even found reeling in the fish was a nice challenge also (for me) but others may not think its hard and just pick it up fast. The only thing I have seen in the negative reviews that I agreed with is the textures and water quality but im running the game on ultra so it didnt bother me. The other presets though are kinda ugly but not ugly enough to give the game a negative review. I am a carp fisherman in real life and this game represents that well. The game is very fun and addicting but definantly not worth 25 bucks with the amount of content but if you get this on sale right now its worth it. If you are a fisherman this game is a must have.

Everything works like a charm and the graphics are really good. Your tacklebox will eventually grow as you play and get more TP (tackle points) to buy stuff for. Be patient because you won't get it all right away, but that's the beauty of the game. You don't have to spend a lot of real money to get what you want, just fish and collect TP (tackle points) and you will eventually be able to buy the stuff you want, without use of any hard earned money. I only hope that one fine day we will be able to catch some barble and perhaps fish in a chalk stream or two, who knows the developers might already have taken this into consideration for future updates.  10 out of 10 possible stars."

If you have it set to advanced ful control then its nearly impossible to play :( Im using Mouse and keyboard but maybe its better with a controller?Free Play is great and competition in single player.I was disappointed that they havent made the single player tornaments lead into eachother etc?A good game idea would be to make single player a bit more of a career mode style with potential to get sponsors, magazine deals etc maybe leading into a Korda team deal and fishing the euros??So far I am enjoying it and to be honest there are too many fish in my opinion. Theres no time to get all 3 rods out or map out the lake features etc. There are constant fish!I like the fact that most Bream just play dead like real life and that Tench fight well etc. Detail to fish behaviour seems to be good.Not sure I get the tackle shop layout but it does mean you cant get all the Korda gear straight off the bat.I've only played for a few hours but I am looking forward to many more.The walking controls within the peg are a bit sensative and you shouldnt need to be stnding on the rods to pick them up.You should be able to walk within the peg with the rod whilst fighting fish as ive had 2 stuck so far that i could have released with walking about.Please give an option to sit on the chair and give a view rather than always standing.Great start and I hope development continues !!!!"

I would give this game a pass and buy some other fishing game...  This one does not work.After some research on the internet I finally was able to get the PC version of this game to work.  So, I am going to change my review to a more positive review of the PC version.However I still believe there is a problem with the Academy in the Xbox version.  The casting just does not work.  That does not make the game unplayable as I found out.  You do not need to do the Academy part of the game in order to play the game.  Just skip the academy on the Xbox.  The free fishing part of the game seems to work just fine on the Xbox.So, I can recommend the game now knowing that you can skip the academy.  But, it would  really be nice if Dovetail Games would fix the academy on the Xbox.  If, in fact, Dovetail claims it is working as designed,  then change the design and make the casting in the academy on the Xbox work the same as it does on the PC."

I AM NOT REVIEWING THE GAMEPLAY!  I AM WARNING FELLOW AMERICANS THIS MIGHT NOT BE FOR THEM AT THIS POINT IN TIME.  This is for those who read reviews more carefully than store pages because we all know how stuff gets left out and details omitted on the store pages. This is for those who are looking for an American fishing game and I am here to tell you it is not.  I also in my original review below have doubts that there will ever be something for Americans. This is a very simple logical result of looking at how long it has taken them to get this far. They are not yet close to having carp done. In order to do lets say, northwest American Salmon fishing it would require at least an equal amount of time because locations, gear, everything is different. To do even catfish which they could borrow alot of stuff from the english carp world it would take months. Now I am not programmer but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see if it takes them over half a year to do 2 fish species with a few sub-species thrown in, then it will take a simular but not as long time to do a single other species. Does this game play ok?? IDK I don't play it anymore and I couldn't tell you because i am not English and I wouldn't fish for a carp if you paid me money to.  But if they ever do add any American species I will be the first MF'er to let yall know.At the moment I cannot recommend this game due to one simple reason. The fishing is foreign. They do plan on having more fish species but for now its just carp and bream. Carp is a throw away fish that noone wants to catch in the US because they are full of bones, eat terrible and are considered the garbage of fish here in the US. Guess English folk love them but here they are junk. Bream is a fish your kid catches here in the US while your fishing for ""real"" fish. Its a kids fish that you can catch here in the US without even trying.So really just have no desire to fish ""ponds"" for carp and bream. When the game gets completed I will give it another review. But I have my doubts that any American fish will be represented well because of the disconnect they seem to have to our fishing world(US). I don't think there is an American among them and fishing in England is apparently vastly different than it is here."

I am enjoying the game, but I must say that casting by moving the mouse and clicking the right button at the same time is messy and inpractical. Anyway, by adjusting the mouse sensibility (middle position) I found that it is a lot easier. Still, I wish it could be done in other way.Lakes are great. Each one with its unical features, including boss fishes. I hope they will add some more lakes in the future. Those available are located in various countrys, and tough the lakes themselves are fictional, they strongly resembles the real lakes of those areas.My main complain is that you don't need much strategy for fishing. I mean, you mainly search for a nice peg, or go stalking. Fish move through the day from one area to another. But there's nothing that you can do to catch a certain species (well, except for the kind of bait you use), or going for real big fish or lake bosses . I would like the game to be more rewarding for the patient, strategic player, but devs tend to make this games more rewarding for begginers, in hope that they won't put down it due to initial boredom. The devs had stated that they are adding float fishing for free in the next weeks, so I hope the game will grow and get better. The store is a bit small, I would like to have more items to buy, including clothes, customized equipment, and so.Oh, and Multiplayer is ok, but is not my thing.Last, but not least: I feel that the game is not very optimized. It won't run fluent in the typical laptop. My GeForce 840N doesn't handle it very nicely. You better check the requirements.As a clonclusion... a very nice game, **if you like these kind of games**. I am in hope that the game community will grow and that the devs will create exciting new scenarios and items."

Please visit the forum as Dovetail have pinned my post regarding how to fix this.http://steamcommunity.com/app/314520/discussions/0/358415738201068385/-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now that's out the way onto the review.I have been playing this came in all stages from alpha, beta, Live.And i can honestly say that they have got a little gem of a game here. If you are not into fishing then this game is not for you .......AT ALL........ you will find it boring.The gameplay is at part ok i find it very easy to catch fish. I just adjust my drag to suit the fish size, and then just hold left mouse button until it is tired, and move my rod from left to right to adjust the strain on my rod ,then hit E to land my fish. Rinse and repeat.......... This needs improving in a big way. How they would do that i don't know.Allso i have yet to lose a fish due to snags in the water this needs improvement or introduced.Allso the UI in the menu needs improving in a HUGE way. Please for the love of god allow me to left drag my mouse button in the Tackleshop so i can go where the hell i want to buy things. The way you have it where i have to keep left clicking arrows FOR, up, down, left, right, to get to where i want is a pain in the backside.I would like see a splash screen or something different when you beat your PB in species of fish that you caught.The same screen over and over again when you caught a fish does get boring and gives no feeling of beating my PB it's just the same old screen. If you can't do that then give me the option to turn the thing off in the menus.And please make the boss named fish more in your face, Bigger font or different splash screen. sometimes i don't even know i have caught one until i load that lake up again and think what the hell when did i catch that.  Like i say need to improve the the fish screens when caught.Multiplayer is ok, same as single player but with real people ...nuff said on that one.Graphics are nice.... nuff said on that one.Overall the game is really good if you are into fishing like me in real life then this game is for you.The things i commented on do not affect gameplay they are just the things i would like to see improved :)Overall 7 out of 10"

One very annoying bug is in free fishing during a long session sometimes you get a bug where you cant set down you rod.. This means you will never be able to control your other two rods again. This is unless you quit and restart free fishing.The casting is another problem I have some sort of power meter or bower button should be used to guarentee you can get at least some distance.. Over use of the power button could be compensated by less accuracy..Ive also had many occurances where I catch the same fish 3-5 times in a row.. However this could be due to the fish staying in the same area and chance?Things I liked, and what i'd like to see: Playing fish is really enjoyable. By far the best fishing sim out there all things considered, just the casting and occasionalo bug that gets annoying. More accesories need to be added such as PVA bags to allow you to send out your hookbait with more feed. Groundbait would be nice too. A slingshot might be a good addition too , this allows more feeding options. Whereas im stuck to using single baits..I hope they continue to refine the game as it does feel in complete, not that much unlockable products in tackle shop ect. I would not reccomend this game yet as I feel like I said its not finished. Thanks for reading.*** Since the updates the casting improvements have addressed my concerns as well as bugs I expirienced. The shop has been filled a bit more too which is good Hopefully my character won't get deleted either."
,Not Recommended,314520,24326417,"Posted: 14 July, 2016",all,Slinkyb,"Best Fishing Game I have played in a long timeSo let me say that this is one of the best fishing games I have played in a long time.  The game has issues.  Hopefully they can fix them.  So if it has issues then why is it the best I've played in a long time?That would be because fishing games aren't made often and when they are they are very arcade now.  No multiplayer and no tournaments for multiplayer.  So what about this game?  Okay I'll tell you the goods and bads and leave it at that.The goods--Good looking Environment.  This includes the water.  I have mine set to highest setting and the water looks great.-Fish graphics are really great.  Fish look very real and are done very well-Fish are swimming in the water you are fishing in.  Yup there are fishing swimming around that you have to hope come across your bait.  The most I went without a bite was 20 minutes, but its also because I didn't move.  It's not arcade feeling and feels like real fishing because of waiting longer times sometimes than others.-This is Euro fishing.  I did't think I would like it because I like to bass fish and such, but I was really wrong.  Catching fish off a peg is great.  You put your rods in the pegs and wait and then hear your line screaming and the peg screaming too.  It can be intense sometimes.-Hook and bait size matter.  These things will make the biggest difference on what size fish you can catch.  Too big of hook and bait and a 8 pound fish cant eat it.  Although they make your peg light up sometimes trying to.-Rod bend is really nice and your player is graphically sound-You see fish jumping out of the water or bubbles where they are feeding-Huge selection of rods, reels, and line.  Bait selection is pretty good and or amazing for bottom fishing.  Since its not bass the amount is good.-This is a 3D game and lake.  You get to literally walk every inch of the lakes and can fish with one rod or use a peg with 3 rods.  This is not that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fishing planet game where you are stuck in one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ section of a non existant lake or river.-They hold tournaments all the time and you can play solo tournaments-MULTIPLAYER!!!!!  You get to fish with friends and watch them reel fish in!!! Holy crap and even can see their peg light up and hear their line screaming out.-You get to walk all over the lake and decide where to fish-Good amount of lakes to choose from although you will be basically fishing the last 2 lakes which have the biggest fish.-BOSS FISH!  There are boss fish in game and make you want to fish all the lakes and even for small fish to try and catch these rare guys.  They go from 2 pounds all the way up to 100.-You can use 3 rods and even use a bait rod to throw bait into the water over your current bait to help get bites.-You can fish night or day and can host a session or join someone elses-Easy to pick up and learn.-Different types of things to fish on.  Gravel, Silt, Weeds-Weeds around lakes are obvious and only a idiot can't find them-Love the netting system.  People are idiots and don't know how to net the fish so they complained a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton and now they are making a automatic netting system.  Really hope they allow us to use the old manual system.  It makes it more realistic and fun.-Casting system is really good and if you dont do it right you wont be casting far.  Easy to learn, hard to master-Pretty RealisticTHE BADS-Here we go-Tension and drag system is not working correctly in game yet.  Its pretty bad, but even then its still fun to catch fish in this game.  Makes me wonder how this company could screw this up since its literally a core part of the game mechanics-Rod, reel, line make no difference in catching fish.  You can use the starter rod setup and catch the 100 pound cat in game.  Just have to keep your tension at 16 and dont break it off and wait for fish to tire.  Then you get him in-Fish seem to be on a rail system when caught.  Almost like they aren't swimming.  You really can't influence how the fish moves or which way.  Although if you hold your rod far right or left they do seem to move that way eventually.-No player made tournaments yet.  LAME!-The fish really don't effect the water.  yea they jump and make a splash, but when hooked they wont do that.  They make small splashes when close, but thats about it.-No in game voice chat just message system-The company doesn't seem to be worrying about the really important aspects of the game and just fixing small stuff that are being complained the most about.  They really need to pull their heads out of their butts and fix the tension and drag issues as well as the fish on a rail system and not really swimming when caught.  Although they said they are fixing rod bend so we will see what that is.Conclusion-Although the bads seem really bad I still have a lot of fun with this game.  I have been fishing since I was very young and I have played very few fishing games that made me enjoy it.  This game has and I even meet some new players on there and we fish together.  Its a great game and if they can fix some core issues it will be a absolute beast in the gaming/electronic fishing genre.  This game has so much promise its crazy.  I know its weird to say that about a game thats out and being bought.  If you see it on sale its a must buy in my opinions.  I paid the full 20 and think it was well worth it.  They will be adding a new lake soon with Pike and lure fishing for the pike.  So I am really looking forward to that.  Hope this helps!UPDATE:  They lost my character who was top level with a ton of TP like over 60,000 and I had a lot of stuff unlocked in game.  All my boss fish I caught everything gone.  The only response I got was a link to their bs site that said nothing about how to fix it.  Because there probably isn't a fix and they know it.  I no longer support this game and hope it burns into the ground.  The game updates have been abysmal to say the least.  Not fixing important bugs or even the drag and reel system that isn't realistic in the least.  It's like a really bad game made by 2 people who don't give a crap about any of the players.  They seriously updated and took out maual netting.  One of the few good things about the game and now its even more arcade because you wait for a fish to lose stamina while reeling endlessly without effecting the fish or you lose it for slack line.  Terrible bs and the Devs need to be held responsible for all this crap and not actually fixing the important stuff.  Thank you!  DO NOT BUY OR SUPPORT THIS GAME!"
,Not Recommended,314520,13480604,"Posted: 20 December, 2014",all,dwarf_toss,"I wouldn't buy into this DLC sales platform. It was semi-working as a beta, but in 2017 it is pretty much broken on its best day.The issues are NUMEROUS, the gameplay is inconsistent, and to add insult to injury they have rapid-fire released 2 paid DLCs for what is an objectively broken game! If it were my game, I'd feel like a crook trying to get dev funding on the back of a broken game, but that's me.To the point:- Fights are awful since removing the netting mechanic. Ever since all you really need to do is reel in with low-ish drag so your line never snaps and wait for it to tire so you can reel it in all the way  and press the net button. Even then sometimes it'll get close and the tension will skyrocket for no good reason annnd you lose the fish anyhow.- This game is very poorly optimized. For how it looks in a given setting it should not be so resource-hungry and laggy.These are the 2 biggest ongoing issues for months and months now. At this point it just looks like they're either trying to fund the development needed to fix this broken game (with new DLC), or are trying to make as much cash as they can off of the game before everyone writes it off forever and it dies.Anyhow, I feel like an idiot for endorsing this game and feel like I got suckered by that video of the team talking about how they wanted to make the best fishing game. It's a damn shame, because as you'll see below, the game had extreme potential at one point.Do not buy unless you can get it VERY cheap and don't mind gambling on its future. I just can't see this game recovering after a few years of spinning its wheels and sinking.What follows is the OLD REVIEW I left from December 2014 when the game was in beta and sadly working better than it does in Q3 of 2017:With Phase 6, I think it's even clearer than before that this game is going to turn out to be something good. It started out as a very solid, albeit bare, fishing game, but with every update features are added, and mechanics are dialed in some more. The team seems to be listening intently and working hard to put out as much win in every update as they possibly can.This update brings a working multiplayer mode, which consists of the training lake (only) and up to 4 (iirc) other people fishing. There is a (half-working atm) chat function that lets players on a lake share tips and brag about big catches, which is very cool (if I see someone landing many fish, I tend to ask what bait they're using). Using chat while on a peg is problematic, though, due to the hotkeys for keyboard controls not being disabled while focus is on the chat box. My whole peg has been closed many times because I tried to chat, heh. The chat box also has a bad habit of ignoring sentences. Other than that, multiplayer is definitely working and enjoyable.The quality of the fishing experience gets better with every update (imo), and the team behind it stay on the forums, getting feedback and making changes based on what they see and hear. Force feedback on a 360 controller is much improved, and the controls, for the most part, make sense. However, general consensus is that a mouse gives much better control of power for accurate casting.You carry a tackle box and up to three fishing rods, and gain new gear by spending money earned from catching fish. Lake bed conditions and other factors make the careful choosing of bait and gear an important part of the process, as well as knowing a good spot or two. One can have 3 fishing rods baited and in the water at a time, and alarms on each rod (audible + light) let you know if something is nibbling and running with anything.There are occasional bugs (flying fish, SPOD-arm until restart), but nothing too bad. After the features get hammered out better I am sure that the few there are will be dealt with accordingly.If you like fishing and video games, this is a pretty safe bet. Just don't expect it to be a polished experience at this time."
