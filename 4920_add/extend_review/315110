The game has a local co-op mode that looks very promising but I haven't been able to try that out yet.Not much else to say here but that the game gets more and more hectic the higher you score until you die so it's all about improving your high score and competing for the top spot among your friends and global leaderboards. If that sounds fun, get it, if not pass."

As a child, Dave had no friends due to his quirky behavior, and so videogames became his only company. They filled his imagination and made every day an adventure. The floor was lava. Adults were alien creatures.One day, Dave's parents realized he was no longer pretending. Touching the floor resulted in shrieking anxiety attacks and catatonia shortly thereafter. His tendency to pelt adults with breakfast food went from cute to terrifying once he developed the strength to put a classmate in the hospital with a hard-boiled egg.Dave was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His mental illness proved unresponsive to standard medication. He had to be involuntarily committed.But captivity did not suit Dave.Venture forth from the confines of the psych ward and take your vengeance on the aliens who seek to deprive you of your freedom and self-determination. But beware, getting too close allows them a chance to dose you with their sedatives. Three doses and you're once again at their mercy, your ears filled with the wailing siren of your oppressors.But no jail can hold Dave forever."

It is just Dave vs aliens. The game randomly drops one of two things from the top of the screen. Either an egg or a skull 'block.' You can pick up either one just by running into them and then throwing them with the throw button. There's a catch though. Both objects have timers. When the skull block flashes, that means it'll explode soon. When the egg flashes, that means it will hatch. Both mean death for Dave if he's holding either one.You can throw the skull blocks into the eggs to smash them revealing a coin for you to collect. You can throw eggs into aliens to defeat them and leave a coin. While you're combating these aliens, the bottom platform is melting away with lava. Once the floor is gone, the lava slowly rises! If a green hatchling alien falls into the lava, it gets wooshed up to the top of the screen and turns red. Making it a fast alien. When the red aliens hit the lava they get thrown back to the top of the screen again. Then they are blue and can jump from platform to platform. If the blue aliens hit the lava again, they turn into Dave seeking eyeballs that can float through platforms. In a way it feels like Super Crate Box, without the guns, extra levels or extra characters.Every once in a while a POW block will drop from the sky. When you smash it against anything but lava, it destroys everything, leaving a coin behind. What are these coins for? A high score of course! Its an arcade game! No points, just coins, which seems like a wasted opportunity. If you get $1.50 in coins, you unlock the bonkers difficulty level. Once you gather a certain amount of coins, the UFO will appear for you to defeat.The controls are simple, jump and throw. The weird thing with this game is its gravity. It just feels like there is super gravity or something odd with how fast things fall back down. It doesn't play as well as other 80s arcade games.There are no phases, its just one long level. You're in it until you use up all 3 of your lives. The real downside to the game is once you've played it for three lives, you've seen all there is to see. Except maybe the UFO. The level changes color, but there's nothing to unlock like new classic arcade games. It feels one dimensional. Mario Bros had bonus levels and a variety of different enemies instead of an evolution of one enemy.If you can keep killing eggs as they spawn from the sky, it makes for a slow, tedious game. If you have a lot of enemies on screen, then it can make for some frantic fun. Then cap it off with a POW block to clear them out and go back to spawn killing them. There is only one song in Woah Dave, and its a great new wave sort of 80s clappy sort of beat.There is a local two player mode where two of you on a single screen fight for to collect the most coins before time runs out. There are online leader boards showing the top 10 globally and your friends. For such fierce competition, the scores are far apart. Not just that, but some people have the 10,000 coin achievement, but no one on the global leader board to back it up.I grew up in the arcade days where every three lives cost you a quarter, so the $5 seems about right. I can't imagine this fitting in shoulder to shoulder with the old classics or even the new ones. It feels like a hastily made cash in that needs some depth and extras. Also, for a game that tries so hard to pattern itself after arcade cabinet games, why do they recommend a 360 or PS controller and not an arcade style joystick?"

Not immediately killing the enemies on screen makes them worth a lot more points, but also makes them much more dangerous. This simple risk/reward mechanic plays out nicely, and always keeps you on your feet (thumbs) as you struggle for the high score. The game is very much ""what you see is what you get"", so don't expect unlocks/a plot/different worlds. That is not to say that it fails.

Although the developers did add a couple more levels (effectively tripling the content), there is still very little gameplay overall. The two new levels have only minor differences from the original. And all the ""new characters"" they added are nothing more than pixel-swaps - they all move and play in exactly the same way.Basically, I would say that if you have a strong fondness for early-to-mid-80s arcade games but wish they were a lot more difficult, you might like Woah Dave. Even then though, I think $5 is too much for what you are getting here.The music is still the best part of the game, by a wide margin.My original review is below, though it's mostly obsolete now:Even at $5, this is one of the biggest ripoffs on Steam. There is only one stage and one game mode. After 5 minutes of playtime, you have seen virtually everything the game has to offer. I paid $1 for it on sale, and I still feel like it was a waste of money. I can't remember the last time I played afreewaregame that was so limited in scope.People say it's an arcade game, so it's supposed to be simple, but even arcade games have multiple stages, particularly games like Joust or Mario Bros., which are Woah Dave's closest relatives, gameplay-wise. Those two games are 30-plus years old now, and they both have far greater ambition and longevity than this one. I would be seriously astonished if the total development time was more than 4 hours, including art and music.(Incidentally, the music is the best aspect by far. I wish they had included a full-length mix that we could listen to outside of the game.)Even a basic level editor would've helped a lot, or some other kind of customization options, but there's nothing."

(you'll definitely know what i mean after you've thrown your WOAH block into the lava by accident more than once.)all this adds up to that you haven't really mastered the game, hours in, even though structurally you understand all the concepts within a minute or two tops. there are emergent concepts and skills that you will only appreciate after sinking time and energy into this title.so many retro-arcade styled games are all style, no substance. woah dave has both in spades, and for 5 usd it'll be a favorite for a while. it's the kind of game you'll always keep in arms reach, especially if you're not usually available for a endless full day civ/4x session but have a few minutes to kill before you need to be out the door.my only warning? your head will hurt after about 30 minutes of non-stop play, not for the visuals, but rather that your mind gets tired of pinpoint precise timing and you start to make stupid mistakes. take a break and come back later."

If this game came out back in the 80s and was in arcades it would have eaten a ton of quarters.Essentially the object of the game is to pick up and destroy the eggs before they hatch. Skulls, eggs, and woah blocks all fall randomly throughout the level as you play. Eggs can be thrown at hatched monsters to kill them but can also hatch while you're holding them and hurt you. Skulls can be thrown at eggs and monsters to kill them, or used as a timed bomb since they blow up after a few seconds. Woah blocks destroy everything in the level. The object is to collect coins and get as high of a score as possible.I picked it up on sale for 99¢ and it's definitely worth it for that price. It's one level that goes as long as you can stay alive. It's a genuine arcade style game. There is also another more difficult mode that is unlocked after you reach a score of $1.50. I did this within my first hour playing although it was not easy to obtain. I recommend using a controller to play the game. Overall it's a great time and I really enjoy it, as simple as it is."

Insteed of score, the game counts how much ""coins"" you collected, which is pretty hard as longer you play.The game is easy placed, it self says you chould best play it with a PSone or Xbox controller but if it should be a ""classic arcade game"" i was about to use my old joySTICK which sadly didnt work...Also, the game feels anyhow as whould it try to be a bunch of old REAL classic games mixedTo the game play self: You play Dave (so i guess) who pic up skull bombs or eggs to smash the alien(eggs). You collect the coins they drops and sometimes a ""WOAH!"" block appiers and you can use it to smash all on screen.Also it gives only ONE screen, nothing more - it maybe changes collors but thats it.Having that all in mind i thought about follow games:Eggs destroying = JoustCoins and WOAH block (which looks a lot like the POW block) = Mario Bros.Level Style = feels like Super Creat BoxBut anyhow, Woah Dave feels really boring after time, there is nothing new, just throwing and thats done. The most thing i hate is that you just need to touch the things and dave picks them up, mostly the things you dont want to pick up. there should be a button to take things and throw them. I often died coz i picked up a bomb i dont want.Also, ""only"" for hunting coins, the game gets pretty quick boring and there is not much to play for, ones you played over or reach ""1.50$"" you can play in a kind of ""hard"" mode which doesnt makes more ""fun"" than the normal mode.Honestly, its not worth the 5$ and looks more like a poor rip-off from the real good classic games like Mario Bros or like.
