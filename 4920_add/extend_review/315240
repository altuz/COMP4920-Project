I tried with all sound qualities.- I record with 50% quality of video. It records with lags with 100% quality of video.- It puts picture from my another folder to video. Then I changed placement of that folder and it was solved. But why it puts pictures from other folders?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh0zOOUjICghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_Ca7lfe-Dk

But ever since i updated to 5.0 lolipop it doesn't work anymore.......The creators told us that they were going to fix it the first quarter of 2015 but we are already in the 4th quarter! I went to their website and they said the same thing back in jan 2015. It seems like they just left us or dont wana tell us that they can patch it because maybe theres no other way of doing it besides rooting our smartphones or whatever.If you have an android lower than 5.0 lolipop then get it. its great for vids, photos such as snap chat or just to record video of your games!If you have above 5.0 lolipop, dont get it. Just look at all the other reviews."

This isn't just recommended.I thought it would be a lot faster (not much lag, better FPS, better resolution) compare to other apps on Play Store but I'm wrong. It's one of the mediocre I've ever tried, luckily I bought in discounted price."

,Recommended,315240,13834362,"Posted: 4 January, 2015",all,HiddenAbilities,"Eh, it's alright if you want to record some games and such. However, you wont get the full frame rate, as to be expected honestly. Pretty good software, works on most devices. Couldn't get it to work on Amazon Fire, because of how difficult it is to properly enable Debugging mode on that. Works fine on new tablet though (Took amazon fire back to get a regular Android from Samsung)"

I have tried to buy a screen recorder on my phone itself and that screen recorder became to very not worth it the resolution was so small that i could not even see the video at all at times but this screen recorder makes me see the resolution very well and it is easier to mess around with the setting then my other screen recorder.

The only problem is is that it will not record the audio from the phone which is rather irrating but instead I raise the volume up to maximum and that usually does the job, apart from that I think you should get it!"
