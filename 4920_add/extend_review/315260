Some of the controls are weird, but not too weird where it stops the game from being fun. The UI takes some getting used to, easily to get a handle of. The options menu is very simplistic. The Diablo in space setting is a nice change of pace."

Do not buy at regular price, cause this game is very often on sale. Thou, even the regular price is only 0.99€.Really fun, really fast, great graphics for 2005, and hack&slash Sci-Fi MOBA RPG. You start on planet, and your name is Hack. You get quests, and kill monsters. They drop great gear, for example Plasma Rifle, armours, helmets... What I LOVE at game is that it's very hardcore. It autosaves, when you die, you load your autosave and spawn a bit back before you died. And also, game has no Tutorial, which I LOVE, so the game is more hardcore. It includes some Tool tips thou. But, the complainers about no tutorial, what would make game interesting if there WAS tutorial and path arrows? I mean, game is about being on Lost Planet, trying to survive. You get simple goals: Kill aliens&Survive. That's all you have to do. This game is way beyond my rating. It deserves a great rate.10/10"

You have a simple variety of stats that you can upgrade when you level for better abilities. Health for your life force and Energy (which roughly equates to mana in D2) for your energy weapons.Instead of gems, you have Biochips which upgrade your character`s skills directly. There`s a fair bit of variety and game play is good enough in short doses between your other daily tasks or for a quick break.The graphics are a little dated but go well with its simple stylized visuals. It will likely run well on a modest to low powered computer.My recommendation goes to those with slower computers that want something that plays like Diablo 2, or for those who want a good ""break game"" that's engaging in short play sessions."

Want to play a game that's as familiar like diablo, but looks blocky and annoying, has an interface that SCREAMS for you to ignore any information it gives you, and is wildly unintuitive despite being likely the 500th in 1000 games almost exactly like it? LOOK NO FURTHER. Your character may not start with any equipment, but HE DOES start with sideburns. The sum total of my experience with this game is as follows: I accidentally quit out of the intro cinematic when it paused for so long at some flavor text I assumed you had to click to advance it (nope -- it quits the cinematic!) then I contemplated why my head looked like a box until I figured out how to confirm that yep... despite having quests to go out into dangerous territory I had literally NO equipment. Guess they want me to earn some, or find some, or cut my teeth on weak enemies before they introduce me to the inventory aspects of the game. Wrong-O. Went outside, was beset by bug creatures and devoured. Then I deleted the game. If I was much younger and felt I had the time to waste I'd have given it what some might have considered a fairer shake. However, my time is honestly more valuable than anything I feel this game might have to offer me. Sad too, as I was in the mood for a futuristic diablo clone. If you want something like this that doesn't look like an angler-fish abortion, I suggest you take a look at ""Space Siege."""

Why?) and without that loot, you're basically screwed from the get-go since punching aliens in the face really isn't a viable option. Once you get past that initial issue you'll run into the second one, which is that the game's aliens deal massive damage, 3 or 4 hits wiping you out even in the starting zone. This wouldn't be so bad if money was more common or upgrades were cheaper, but no: getting any kind of significant armor or stocking up on healing items is an exercise in grinding (non-respawning) that gets old before it even begins, since even with your most powerful starting weapon the most basic enemies take 3-4 hits to take down.Space Hack isn't all terrible. The interface is simple, controls are responsive, and other than some quirks of being a true 3D semi-isometric hack n' slash (no enemy highlights behind objects, areas where there's just no good camera angle) the game looks fairly nice for its age.I just wish it were a less punishing experience.If you're a hardcore hack n' slash player, or looking for a challenge, take a look at Space Hack: for the price, you can't really go wrong. On the other hand, if you're looking for a more easygoing Diablo II-ish experience, pick up a Torchlight game and steer clear of this masochist."

Various fixes and tweaks suggested, with various degrees of success.  For less than a quid I wasn't expecting it to be stellar, but not working is about the most basic of f**k-ups.Heh.  Steam just said I couldn't post a review until I'd used the product for at least 5 minutes.  If I could have used it for 5 minutes, I wouldn't be posting such a 5h1tty review!"

I had frequent crashes during gameplay. Got bored with it after a few hours.Not recommended, unless you want to play with every one of this types of games."
