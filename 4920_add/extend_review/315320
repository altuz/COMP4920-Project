It's just a sequence of combats reminiscent of about a gazillion generic flash games.- After a while it degrades into a grind of one-hitting until the opponents get so strong that you have to retreat and start the next grind.- ""The Dark Eye"" universe is far away. Maybe a thing or two taken from there but that's about it.Pros:+ Graphic style is quite nice but not contributing to the gameplay."

Your character is immortal, and if you are defeated in combat you get a tiny slap on the wrist (which may not be anything at all, depending on how many items you found on that particular adventure).Speaking of ""adventure,"" the game has only one mechanic: click to start the fight. Each fight is automatic, with zero input from you. All you have to do is decide whether to fight the next enemy or to run back to town and heal. That is the entire game. I have played far more complex high-school coded flash games.The list of reasons not to play does not end there, though. The enemy design and ""animations"" are exceptionally poor. English language errors appear on nearly every sentence (this was NOT proofread), Sound frequently swaps left/right channels. A skill which purports to do damage does not do damage.I have no idea how such a one-dimensional, thoughtless, sophomoric title got the Dark Eye name behind it, but your time and money are far better spent elsewhere."

The skill tree is the same for all characters and the combat is automatic. I found that i just ended up using blitz skill first to one shot every enemy with no semblance of strategy. If you cant beat an enemy then just go back to town and start over, one shotting enemies until you get bored. I made it to level 20 before i gave up."

Well, there is almost no story to speak of, and the game seems to be only superficially related to the world of Aventuria as far as I can tell, but the main problem with this game is the excessive degree of grinding required to reach the end.  By level 50 or so, you have to literally fight dozens upon dozens of battles which don't give you ANY experience (enemies 10 levels below your character don't offer experience), which wouldn't be so game-breaking if you the shopkeeper offered weapons that were anywhere near as good as the ones you find along the way.  You essentially have no way to improve your chances for later battles.I can't count how many times I've fought through over 80 enemies (none of them giving me XP) only to face one or two that DO give XP and then die shortly thereafter to begin the grind again.  On my last run, I fought over 300 enemies without gaining experience!  This is unforgivable game design in my book.  It wouldn't be so bad if you could skip past the many experince-less battles to the enemies that you are ""on par"" with (who are all MUCH stronger than you), or if varying your strategy actually made a discernable different to the outcomes of battles.  I only held out as long as I did in hopes of getting the last achievement for Steam...As much as I wanted to enjoy this, I can't recommend it.  Maybe if it's on sale for a huge discount and you're extremely bored..."

So even though the genre (roguelike) is not really my thing, I needed to have this game.  Happely I bought it in a sale and didn't spent too much money on it.  Still, it was a waste of good money.There are very good TDE games out there.  This however, is *not* one of them.Apart from hardly being a game, this has absolutely nothing to do with TDE.  It could be set in any setting.It is a game about grinding.  It gets even worse there.  You need to grind to be able to ... grind.  What I mean by that is that you need to get money, experience, diamonds, equipment  and poitions to get further and further in the dungeons.But don't expect walking around in an actual dungeon.  You will get fight after fight after fight.  Every 10 fights you get a boss-fight (which is a little harder).  You cannot rest.  Only retreat (or use poitions) when low on health.  When you retreat you start over again with fight 1,  (You'll keep XP, money, and if you weren't defeated, you'll keep the equipment as well.)  So you fight your way through the same dungeon over and over and over again.As you proceed into the dungeons, the fights get thougher.  At a certain point, the crits at the beginning of the dungeon won't give you anymore XP (loot is still there).  So to raise your XP, you need to get far in the dungeon.  (Grinding to be able to grind...)The fights themself are not really impressive.  You have 6 slots.  You can place a skill in each slot (or leave it empty for a normal attack).  Once set, press the fight-button and watch the screen until the fight is over.  Nothing else, that's it.Placing and removing the skills from the slot is exhausting.  An interface which doesn't react very fast and an awfully lot of buttons and icons to press, all over your screen.There is no way to save the skill-order you have chosen.  So even if it is the 100th time you try to kill the same boss, you still need to set the skills ... again.Positive+ Cheap (if you buy it on sale)+ runs stableNegative- Grinding- Even more grinding- No TDE world- Annoying- Feels more like occupational therapy then an actual game- Even if you bought it in a sale, it costs still too much.- No save for a skill-config (only the last set config sticks)Recommendation:Buy Drakensang (the first one) for a fun RPG, Blackguards (the first one) for a fun grid-based turn-based battle game or Chains of Satinav for an fun adventure.  And even though they are old, the Realms of Arkania are still fun to play cRPGs (specially the last onme, Shadows Over Riva)."

When you have a encounter you can change your skills, press the fight button, and you and said monster go head to head in a 6 turn battle, in which you take turns, attacking, and doing skills and spells, There is various status anomalies, and skills, lots of loot, including gold, weapons, and armor. You can choose from three races, each with their own advantages, but then you cannot choose your class, you are alway's a Elemental Knight, still, there is customizable options for your character, there are elite monsters (Harder versions of the regular monsters) and boss monsters,just about everything you want from a RPG, but alas, still it plays like a free Flash RPG. It's not bad though, quite a fun time waster, but nothing Rogue like about it, except random encounters, and loot. The Boss Monsters are the only exception to the rule of randomness, they are always the same, and always on the same level. In the end a good game, and worht buying if it sounds like your kind of thing, on sale, maybe, but at 9.99 it's just to hard to reccomend this game."

It was also on steam sale so very cheep.Pros:Simple flash gameEasy fun, play it with a pen and paper to write down the combos that work for each mobShort to play thoughSome interesting ways to deal with mobs based on the skills you haveCons:Item drops are mostly useless, all upgrades come from the shop (which you can ""farm"" by reloading your profile in game)It can get grindy if you build your hero's stats wrong and need to farm the shop for the right items.Spoliers:Their is no cap to your iventory (I got mine to 355 out of curiosity)Leveling up increses the stat that is your races more than the others, makeing dwarves probably the worst race as constitution is almost useless, when you are pushing your lvl cap if you get hit you die anyway even with stacked defense and resistance.Also Blitz and Windbreak are OP, both are must haves for the final"
,Recommended,315320,13230631,"Posted: 4 December, 2014",all,Sixxs,"The game itself feels incomplete at this stage, given that a lot of animations are broken or missing, model designs are low quality as well as enemy designs.Skilltree Saga is reasonably entertaining, although very repetitive and grindy towards the end of the game. You will find yourself sitting down for a decent 6-10 hours just to finish the last map alone depending on what class you choose.  The name itself is deceptive, in that the skills in the skill tree are very limited and there are only a few core abilities worth using out of the entire selection, adding to the already evident lack of balance in the end-game.Despite it's flaws, Skilltree Saga is still a fun game, but I would recommend waiting for it to go down to around $5 before purchasing it in its current state."
76561198073648775,Not Recommended,315320,15628110,"Posted: 30 April, 2015",all,Suma,"***WARNING!!!*** Make a profile first thing, or try exiting the game after the tutorial. Whatever you do, DO NOT click on ""Options"" and then ""Profiles"" if you have NOT made a profile yet.  See the picture below:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=435057768You might be able to ""Exit"" the game from the ""Options"" menu and it might ask you to save, but if you accidentally go into the ""Profiles"" menu without first making a profile, you are out of luck! Now that I made a new character profile, the game boots directly into the ""Profiles"" menu so you can either create a new profile or load an existing one. This should have been the default for the very first time you play!I lost over 100 minutes and my first character by doing this. Once you enter the ""Profiles"" menu, there is NO way to exit it without either creating a new character or loading your previous character which didn't exist for me yet. If you do not make a character profile first and save your game, you risk losing all of your progress! All of your hard work might be lost!My advice to the developer(s), make it so the first thing you do is create a freaking profile and save file! Also make it so the ""Escape"" key exits out of the ""Profiles"" menu without having to make any choices. How did you NOT think of this? Terrible, lazy programming IMO. What were you thinking? Or maybe you weren't thinking… Please fix the profile problem!!!Skilltree Saga is a pure character builder and a major grind-fest, which is okay with me! I WAS having a pretty good time! As you level up, you feel stronger as you progress with every level and new items. The fighting does take some strategy, but only arranging your skills in what order they will be used. All fighting after that is automatic. As with many RPG type games, the fun is in leveling up and finding new gear & loot! This game does that well, but the fighting aspect will turn off most gamers.I cannot recommend this game until the profile problem is fixed! I am not sure why no one else has complained about this. I assume if you ""Exit"" the game from the ""Options"" menu, it will ask you to save the game. I don't know for sure though. It now boots into the ""Profiles"" menu at startup so I can start a new game or load a previous one. Again, why isn't the game setup like this the first time you play dev's???I had to force quit the game and lost everything. I couldn't get out of the ""Profiles"" menu and my only other choice was to create a new profile stating it would wipe out my previous progress anyway! I force quit hoping there was a save file somewhere that would load the next time I started the game. There wasn't. So, I lost everything I did in the first 100+ minutes! :-(Here are my system specifications: Apple iMac, i5 Quad-Core Intel processor 3.1GHZ, AMD Radeon HD 6970M with 1GB dedicated video RAM, 4GB system RAM, 1TB hard drive running OS X version 10.6.8, Journaled HFS+ Extended file system, Logitech optical mouse.Edit: I started a new character ""Profile"" and saved it! Now I am in the second of the three areas having fun again. As I said, Skilltree Saga is strictly a character builder. There is not much of a story and all the battles are 1 vs 1. It's like a game you might see on something like FaceBook, minus the IAP micro-transactions. It looks like it would be very easy to include IAP though, and at some point it might.Anyway, it is a ""very"" casual game that requires just a few mouse clicks and not much brain power to play. I like it because it is a character builder with random encounters. weapons and items. There are Elite and Boss fights throughout, which ramp up the battles. That is about as much Rogue-Like (or Lite) as this game gets. There is no perma-death. If you lose a battle, you just end up back in town, but you do lose the items you found during that dungeon run... You do get to keep the experience that you earned though, so you do keep leveling up even if you keep losing the battles.I give it 5/10 for effort... And because I'm still playing it after 7+ hours... :-)I still cannot recommend this game to everyone. Most people will disagree with me already! Maybe at $5 or less...  If you like building characters and don't mind the ""mindless"" gameplay, then check it out on sale ONLY!!!Edit:  I am still playing this game after 8+ hours strait and plan on playing some more, so I guess I like it! lol"

There is no story (kind of, but who cares?) only leveling up and farming for equipment.

The story is quite unremarkable (if even existent), the whole gamemechanics don't share much but a few keywords with the TDE-world, and if you played some of the other titles of this developer, you realize where many of the graphic ressources come from, and why they don't really seem to fit to the games proclaimed universe..Basicaly the monsters from the Grotesque-World seem to make holiday in Aventuria.Yes, right. Mushrooms, Mosquitos, Spiders and Blobs, just to name a few, aparently where taken completly from Grotesque Tactics 2. Of course thats something, that doesn't fit well into this actual setting.Most of the music I heard, in the few hours I played so far, seems to be reused from Grotesque as well. And apparently Rukel has a sidejob as merchant in Greifenfurt these days.Apart from that, its mainly a game about the adjustment of the various skills you can get, to fit 6 rounds of battle with various opponent types. Also you gotta grind some levels and find equipment to rise some basic stats. Go into the wood/dungeon until you find an enemy(-type) you can't defeat, return to town and repeat the grind until you leveled enough to defeat them and/or found adequate equipment.No, sorry, as much as I like the other titles of Silent Dreams so far, there is no way I could rate this one positive.If you are looking for a real roleplay-experience in the deep and atmospherical world of TDE you are better off to find Drakensang or one of its successors for the same price in a budget pyramid. Or maybe you find the good old northland trilogy."

You don't actually control your character during fights, instead you set him up beforehand based on your next opponent. When you reach an opponent that is out of your league, you simply click the retreat button and go back to town to buy better gear. The caveat being that when you retreat from a dungeon you will have to start from the beginning of it next time you enter.
