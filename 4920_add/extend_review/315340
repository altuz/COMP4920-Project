Thats a positive... you now have to find unlocks to unlock your upgrades, thats a second plus... You get a new character thats like a heavy class/tank compared to the original character, and he plays... kinda meh. His special is a shield that uses up energy vs health...Other changes is that you have infinite bombs/electrical blasts and they are on a CD. Repair kits are also on cooldown and have a 100 resource cost. All can be upgraded.Graphics: Uh, I don't like what they did with the supporting cast, the characters and bosses look just as great, but what did they do to the women... its like they changed how they wanted them to look and they look awful. The gameplay is still as crisp and looks similar if not better than the original.Controls: Yup, did you hate Ares, you'll hate this... love it... you'll love this... its not changed, and its still as wonky as when I played it the first time, jumping off the ends of ledges... good luck and do it early.So that I've writen this game, if you haven't played the original, you may like what you see, if you have... I'd avoid this for awhile, its in a kinda crashy state in which you have to launch the game again nearly every level I think the changes they put forth are positive for the game, but the new levels aren't really impressive, and the new character while plays slightly different, continues to be similar to what you've done before.Verdict: Pass, and if you want to get a version get the original for now... I might review once they patch all the crashy bugs... but I cannot honestly reccommend as of 10/4/14"

Not that long and not that hard even on the hardest difficulty unless you're trying for optional things like high ranks, but if it's cheap and the short blurb sounds interesting to you, you'll likely find this an enjoyable game.""That's what I said about the original A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda. That pretty much holds true for EX, but it seemed somewhat more difficult (or I was just being bad at it) and has been reworked to be a good bit longer, with two extra levels, more cutscenes, and a second character with different abilities who you can choose to play through the game with instead. So, basically it fixed all of my complaints.Given that they're the same original asking price, I would obviously recommend picking this one up instead if you don't have either. About all this game is missing is the goofy skins and the Berserker weapon, and skins are just cosmetics and the Berserker weapon was kind of overpowered anyway! If you do have the original, I think it's still worth it given the discount...!"

I played the original version of this game some years ago, but didn't get around to playing this version until today.At the end of my run as ARES, I was ready to give Extinction Agenda EX a thumbs down, and maybe I still should: It's one of the jankiest run-and-gun games I have ever played. Asthetically, it's fine: The music is excellent and the sprite work fairly appealing. Aiming and shooting is just fine thanks to the mouse, but the jumping controls are uniquely unresponsive and occasionally just fail to work at all. ARES' air dash move is especially difficult to use properly. I must have wasted an hour of the two hours it took to finish the game just falling into pits. It's also rather difficult to avoid damage, and if not for the in-built repair ability, I probably would not have gotten anywhere. I imagine I had a similar experience playing the first version of this game, but that was back in 2011 so I don't remember for sure. Nostalgia makes every game seem better I guess, because I gave that game a positive review just yesterday. But playing it again was not nearly as fun.Then, I played Tarus, the new playable character to this version of the game. And let me tell you, playing Tarus is like playing a different game entirely, and a better one at that. ARES' unwieldy air-dash is replaced with a much simpler to use mid-air hover move, which allows you to fly around for a short duration. At least once jump segment that gave me no end of trouble with ARES can be bypassed using Tarus entirely: Though Tarus' cutscenes differ from ARES, the levels do not. His ""limit break""-type move, instead of a smart bomb like ARES, is a invulnerability shield. His weapons, while shorter-ranged and slower then ARES', do considerably more damage. All this meant that my run as Tarus took about half the time, give or take a few minutes. I've never seen a disparity between two characters in the same game this huge before. If you get this game, get it on sale like I did, and don't even bother playing as ARES- Tarus is your bot."

Extinction Agenda EX is a side-scrolling mecha shooter game, safely to say a Megaman clone.You have 2 mechs to choose from Ares and Tarus, similar to the roles how X and Zero in Megaman series.Each has different set of weapons and abilities and both have different storyline, though same levels and objectives.The game technically and visually is good, however the soundtrack doesn't fit and really boring.The story in general is generic, although it has few cool twists. But it's nothing special at all. You go on levels, destroy bots to save humankind. That's it.You have also a human female as an assistant that communicate with you throughout your mission and develop new upgrades for you suit.During the levels there are database cubes and upgrade units to collect, the former for expanding game lore to read and the later allow you to upgrade weapons and abilities.Each character has 7 levels, which are exactly the same but different dialogues.And you can beat the entire game in few hours (took me 5 hours).Let's switch to the cons:- Level designs: Some areas can be really frustrating, designed to hinder your movements limits to your demise.- Unskippale scenes: This really made me mad, because checkpoints happen before a hard part, which forcing me to watch the same scene over and over and over until I successfully pass the area. Boss Battles has the same problem.- Checkpoints sometimes are set far from each other, again due to some areas being frustrating, having to run through many rooms/traps/enemies before you getting to a new checkpoint isn't really a nice idea if you want to put a challenge in the way. I really don't like repeating the same steps for 5~10 times before I figure out a solution.- The Ending (both endings), although are good, end abruptly. It would be better to see at least a glimpse of the aftermath.6.5/10"

Both playable characters in this game are a unique mix of all 3 main characters in Mega Man X8 (X, Zero, and Axl). With Axl's 360 degree firing ability, Zero's ability to double jump, and X's ability to upgrade himself.The game can be challenging at times, but it's never so difficult that it seems impossible to complete.There are a lot of hidden items and secrets to find and a few alternate routs.I used an Xbox Once controller with this game with no problems since it had a pre-setup profile for the controller built into the game right from the start.Overall I've found this game to be a great game, and a good example of how to do a Mega Man X game right!If your a fan of the Mega Man X series, or just a fan of the Mega Man franchise in general, then you can't go wrong with picking this one up.

,Not Recommended,315340,12503899,"Posted: 15 October, 2014",all,Dangerous Beans,"Do not spend more than $5 on this. Try to spend less than $5 if at all possible.This is a game that's clearly had a ton of work put into it, but suffers badly at the hand of poor design decisions. Most significantly, the controls are really really bad, owing mainly to the mouse-aim/keyboard move idea paired with complex key-combinations for executing some techniques that the game chooses to make necessary in so many different places. Having bad controls and then choosing to make the game primarily centered around performing ridiculous mid-air maneuvers every 2 seconds is not really conducive to a good gameplay experience. It just feels cheap and unrewarding. Adding the control pad support should have fixed this, but unfortunately it didn't. You have to use both thumbs to move and shoot, but a lot of the primary functions, like jumping, are on the thumb buttons, so you have to stop shooting to jump or use a special. Additionally, instead of letting the dash direction be controlled by the movement stick, they split it between the L/R bumpers, which is completely unintuitive and, again, just plain bad. It really is a deal-breaker.The upgrade system seems like a decent idea until you realize that you not only have to find the upgrade item in the game, but you also have to spend currency on it. The currency is pretty ubiquitous, to the point that it sometimes literally rains from the sky (wtf), but you also spend it to activate your special moves, which is kind of stupid.The graphics are very high-quality. They're at or above the level of AAA games of this kind. There is some noisiness, though, that gets in the way of gameplay, such as foreground girders concealing the fact that the ceiling is suddenly lower, and you find out by trying to jump over an enemy attack only to find that you have no clearance.The audio is also excellent, with an appropriate high-quality soundtrack accompanied by decent SFX.In short, it's a game that's worth playing, but it's not worth spending $10 on. Not even by a long shot.If you can get it on sale then $5 is a maximum price. It's not a complete waste, but considering that one man can make a Cave Story in his spare time and release it for free, platformer designers should AT LEAST get together the gumption to make a game that can be controlled smoothly. To make the obvious comparison to MegaMan, the presentation is better than anything the MegaMan series has to offer, but the gameplay is worse than anything the MegaMan series has to offer."

A.R.E.S. was already a decent sidescrolling platformer. This is simply an upgrade in graphics. minor adjustments to game mechanics, and the inclusion of more story (which is told through cutscenes). Besides those changes, the game is exactly the same as the original and does not merit the price that it was given at launch and still does not merit. I would only buy this game on sale, even if you do not own it."

A.R.E.S EX is an amazing game and definatly worth it. I got the game on sale for a grand £1.60 instead of it's base £6.99. This game is a remake of the A.R.E.S Extinction Agenda and isn't just that, they added in a new character with their own story and ending, along with 2 new levels not seen in the origional AEA. Tarus, the new character added, uses the same base weapons as Ares, yet he is, in my eyes, more of a beef-y character, with his first gun you start the game with working as Ares' once you upgrade it once. His design is significantly different to Ares aswell, showning the plit between the two. This game is a 2.5d platforming shooter in the vein of Mega Man and Metroid from back in the 8-bit era. This game is so much more of a tribute to Mega Man than Mighty No. 9, with more challenging game design and bosses. It doesn however work in a linear story, with upgrades seen through the game and backtracking allowed to unlock everything you miss while going through the game."

I really really do! it's been on my wishlist for what feels like forever. it's been on here for so long that I didnt even know that they made this ""EX"" version of it until this very summer sale.now that we have the intro out of the way:+the visuals are really nice and pretty. the interface is clean, easy to understand and doesnt interfere or hinder gameplay in any way.+the soundtrack is awesome and gets you pumped, wanting to keep charging in, dodging and weaving while dishing out your own punishment.+it has that fun factor that you want in an arcade-style game in the vein of megaman, metroid, I'll even throw in contra and metal slug.+the level up system is simple+the upgrade system is simple as well and clearly meant to foster replayability (and done right, I'd say)+enemies are cool looking and there's enough of them to present a challenge as well as allowing for satisfactory accumulation of your currency/resource. BUT!and here's where we get to the cons:-the hitboxes seem off to me. maybe I'm crazy but there are times where I've gotten so frustrated when I analyze a bosses pattern, go to dodge and watch myself still get hit.-that also being said, the controls are definitely sluggish (using a mechanical keyboard). input lag is a very real and very deadly thing in this game, especially in boss fights and even more so when it comes to platforming puzzles where timing is key.again, I really really really want to like this game. it's got that something that really helps scratch that arcadey-classic side-scrolling shooter itch and does a lot of things right that other similar games dont (level up, upgrades, interface, soundtrack, etc). but the fact that the controls are so slow and the hitboxes dont really seem to match the visuals sometimes just weighs so heavily upon this game since it's fairly fast paced. you're not sure why you didnt dodge that thing when it looked like you did on the screen, and you're pretty sure that you tried to 2xjump+air dash up, but instead you just headbutted the edge of the platform. I'll admit, I'll still keep playing this game and try to ""get gud"" but as it stands now, I cant recommend this game on the grounds of its combat and controls. if one was spot on accurate, the other wouldnt matter as much. but the fact that both of these major issues  are in the game just make it incredibly frustrating to make it past battles/platform areas. one last plus side though is that you dont really loose anything other than distance when you die"

Extinction Agenda EX is a 2.5D side scrolling game that feels like a fun mix between a dual stick shooter and Metroid. So far I am really enjoying this game. So far playing it on medium it has had its share of difficulty combined with enjoyable boss battles.Here is a video of early game play.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYImDmnkVjo&feature=youtu.beThe game really is in the vein of metroid in the whole being in a mechanical suit looking for upgrades thing. Also where the upgrades will unlock new areas that were previously unexplorable. Oddly enough I have recieved a few upgrades and have yet to seen an effect on my person.This is not just a run and gun type game either. There are several parts that include tough timing jumps and multiple button pushes. If not you will fall to your death often like myself. I don't know if I like the dieing over and over when the main part of the game is a 2.5D gunner. So far I recommend this game but in a way it is still up in there air and will report back as I get in deeper to the game.ProsThe controls feel responsive and right.The artwork is great.I don’t have to play with the music turned off.The story so far is actually engaging.Character ability upgrades keep things fresh.Checkpoints are nice kinda forgot about them with all the roguelikes out.ConsThings you kill come back once they are off screen kinda annoying.Though as nails when it come to timing jumps and not always in a good way.Tons of upgrades but some seem to do nothing.Hope I dont have to do a second playthough just to collect the power ups but seems that way.Quick edit here. There is a talent tree in game where you can upgrade all your moves and weapons armor ect. This is not covered in the tutorial and I found out about it by accedent. This added a lot of depth to the game. This is a great deal at $10 buck and I recommened it highly. You will get more than 10 hours of game play out of it for sure.For a full indepth review please check out my podcast where I try out cheap games and let you know if they are worth your money or not.

First, there is only one type of scrap now. This means that you no longer need to grind for the 3 different types like you did in the original.  Second, you now have to find upgrade chips before you are able to build the upgrade. This effectively stops players from getting really overpoowered too early on. Third, there are some reworked levels. Those can be good or bad depending on your opinions. Finally, there's the added character Taurus.  He's more tanky than ARES, and all of his weapons are shorter ranged, but with more area of effect and a slightly different story line. Overall, this game is on par with the original, if not a little bit better. However, it would be definitely better if they would add in the Berserker suit and soundtrack already!"

It plays like half of a twin stick shooter, only slower.  I was hoping for something fast paced with a lot of quick reflex platforming and gun combos (think MegaMan X), but was left wanting."
,Recommended,315340,12546216,"Posted: 18 October, 2014",all,Pave,"The short answer for ""Is this game-update worth 5€?"" is simply ""Yes"", even if granted biased (especially due getting the ""Apollo Drone"" to pick up the scrap, the upgrading-currency in this game).(My personal) Most Important selling points:This game is certainly more streamlined and not anymore menu-heavy when it comes to game-play in general, mainly because you don't have to fiddle with bombs or repair-kits; these are now abilities in cooldowns (though Repair costing 100-scraps per use).""Triple Jump"" is also it's own ability which doesn't require any scraps nor it does have a cooldown. While you'll need to press a separate button, it's certainly more easier to pull off than ""bomb jump"" used to be.It's however worth noting that the bosses have been reworked too, so they will certainly caught veteran-players off-guard during the several initial trial&error-sessions.Mostly the same, some improvements, and little bit something new.I personally enjoy this update more than I did enjoy the original-version."

I haven't completed it yet but i'll give it an update on how the game truely is.My problem with this game so far is how fast Ares drops. let me explain it like this, if you do a normal jump, he falls too quickly and in some situations, you'll be asking yourself ""why does he fall so quickly""? Not only that but you might get stuck in certain sections of any level.Overall, this game is great. If you like 2.5D action game like megaman, then you'll like this one."

I love the difficulty of hardcore mode considering I play EVERY game on the hardest difficulty.  But on that difficulty starting out it reminds me heavily of how the original MegaMan games used to be and I love that.  And going by my avatar you can tell I'm a big fan of the Megaman Series and this game feeds that need i was craving for this type of game.  I wish there was more to this game than 7 levels, but I'm comfortable with how this is,  I recommend this for any one who's a fan  of the MM series and platformers/shooters."

,Not Recommended,315340,12363166,"Posted: 4 October, 2014",all,JorisCeoen (GamingReviews),"You should have known better for a god damn retake of the game.Do you think letting players respawn a ♥♥♥♥ing meaningless sentence before each boss battle is enjoying? This game, although released in 2011, has learned nothing to the road of 2014 games, where respawning and checkpoints are at least upgraded as opposed to the old days.No, this game instead tries to make you enjoy a terrifying experience by letting you die and die and die and you hardly are capable of learning anything new before having to do back route X to get to boss fight again. You end up wasting lots of time for nothing at all, nothing fun, nothing rewarding whatsoever.The game's graphics are really top-quality in the genre, and the music is ok although becomes repetitive, just like the gameplay.I unfortunatly have to thumb down this game, if not just for the fact that's it's a remake and it yet has one of the most frustrating gameplay flaws that none of the developers on the team have learned from the past. Just like we won't learn that war is a terrible thing, some gaming developers will never learn that checkpoints before an important something should, yes indeed, be played RIGHT BEFORE something important, not in front of a lift that wastes everytime 15 seconds if not more, seeing the same♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over again.I would say, if you are really fond of the genre, then buy it, but you'll have to endure a lot of trial-and-error that is simply outdated and not satisfying. If you don't have the remake but the older one, stick with it."

Now every single time I've went to open and play it the damned thing crashes and quits responding. What in the world Steam? I get to the character select screen and it does this. I am really starting to question the actual integrity of Steam, a lot of the games, and the user reviews lately. So far, I don't recomend this game. If it starts to play, instead of freezing up, maybe I'll give it a recomendation but until then I am not going to recomend it and I'm not going to NOT recomend it. Just that so far it crashes directly after the character selection screen. (Changes my thumbs down just now to a thumbs up thanks to the seemingly overnight fix of this game. The players spoke and the comany fixed it.)"
