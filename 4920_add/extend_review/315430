Game used to be $5, but the second people started buying the game they raised the price to $11 and constantly shifted the price around that point; however, whenever there is a sale, they change the release date of the game in order to get it to show up on the front page, which is a very irresponsible way to advertise a 2 year old game. Disgusting. Do not buy this game at full price. If you really want to play it, pirate it, but I wouldn't even bother since there's little to no content and no new updates for over a year.EDIT: Changed the incorrect information brought up by the developers."
76561198019110852,Not Recommended,315430,32490650,Posted: 16 June,all,atlcdp,"This game can be summed up in two words: wasted opportunities.First off, the game looks amazing. The graphics are rather simplistic cyberpunk, but they do exactly what they need to. The soundtrack fits the theme of the game perfectly.The main mechanic of the game, switching between red and blue, is criminally underused. There are only 2 objects in the game that care about your polarity; lasers (which will kill you if you don't match the polarity) and gates (which are solid walls if you don't match their polarity and passthrough if they do match). I can only think of 2 levels where polarity is more complicated than leaving it on the right one, and one of those is the tutorial. Too many puzzles are simply about putting cubes in the right holes. Go look up an indie game by the name of ""death squared"", and you'll see so much more that can be done with simply being red vs. blue.The main goal of the game, collecting data fragments, is more of a chore. I think there are 3 in the entire game that are hidden cleverly, or are rewarding to collect.Most criminally, however, is its length. If you look near my name, you’ll see that I've played the game for less than an hour. Well, I'm already done with the main game. There are only 12 levels, and since every 2 levels introduce some new mechanic, the game never fully utilizes its own mechanics.If they made more levels, more polarity affected components, or a level editor, (preferably all 3), this game would rival portal as a sci-fi immersive puzzle game. As it is, though, it's nothing more than an attempt to ride portal's fame, without adding anything meaningful."
,Not Recommended,315430,20195309,"Posted: 1 January, 2016",all,Red Reign,"QUICK NOTE: At the time I'm writing this, the game is on sale at $0.54 (95% off). At that price, I could recommend the game, sure. Unless you absolutely cannot get enough first person puzzle/platforming, I wouldn't get it otherwise, especially not at $10.99.---You play as a hacker that is being paid (presumably) a large amount of money to hack into a level and steal data through some physical manifestation of your target's... network? Mainframe? God knows. The point is you have to go through 12 levels (followed by another 10 bonus levels), collecting 3 Data Fragments per level.The main gimmick of the game is that you can switch your ""Polarity"" at will - between red and blue. While a certain color, you will collide with objects of the opposite color (such as lasers, which will kill you), but pass through objects of the same color. There are also cubes (pretty much tiny Companion Cubes) which behave in a similar fashion. The cubes will power things when plugged into a slot, very similar to how Companion Cubes could hold buttons down to keep platforms suspended, etc. in Portal. Add a couple generic objects, such as launch pads and moving platforms, and you pretty much have the entire game.The game unabashedly takes a lot of inspiration from Portal: levels feel like sterile, self-contained test chambers, the only difference is that everything's dark grey instead of white, and you don't have a charming robot voice monologuing you or telling a story while you progress; the large and open, but still linear level design; and a general futuristic theme (though it's admittedly silly to mash both Portal and Polarity into such a vast genre and expect it to mean anything).You don't need to collect the 3 Data Fragments to technically ""beat"" the level - rather, you can simply progress through the level and find the exit. This is where most of the difficulty comes from. However, Data Fragments are required to unlock the next levels. They are usually poorly hidden, if not put directly in plain sight, and by simply walking around the room you can easily tell how to get to the fragments. The worst the game will do is put them behind a small puzzle, or out of your immediate field of view when you enter a room. To put it into perspective, the only levels I needed to play more than once were the first and second levels, where I missed one fragment each, because it was placed slightly out of sight or in a corner that I had carelessly overlooked.It doesn't feel good to collect data fragments because the level design is not challenging at all. The main ""puzzle"" in each level often requires next to no thinking. I beat all 22 single-player levels in about 50 minutes, and was fairly bored the entire way through. Sadly, this is why I can't say I recommend this title.It's not that the art style is uninspired and simple - that doesn't necessarily make a game bad.It's not that the music, and the general sound design for that matter, has a generic, forgettable 80s futuristic feel, which I'd normally think was quite humorous or charming - lots of devs these days just use stock royalty-free music and nobody seems to mind that too much. At least this has custom music (I think).It's not that it's trying to copy Portal - I don't see a huge amount wrong with following the footsteps of a very successful puzzle game and trying to recreate that formula!It's not even that the first person animations, head bobbing, and movement glitches make it painfully obvious this is a 3D Unity game. Or that my Logitech F310 - a fairly good controller when it comes to compatibility - would only work during the main menu and the two ""cutscenes"" that exist in singleplayer.The problem is the frankly depressing lack of content, and, more importantly, the content thatISthere is unchallenging, unengaging, and simply not fun. As a developer, I'd be disappointed if I spent a significant amount of time and effort building a game and only could be bothered to make a few mediocre-at-best levels that don't even show the potential of what few mechanics that DO exist. As a consumer, I'm very confused with how this game has so many positive reviews - must just be me being out of touch with the puzzle game community. Don't expect level design that lives up to Portal, or any other good puzzle game I can think of, really.TL;DR - Game's really dry on content, and what contentDIDmanage to find its way in is insultingly easy and boring. I'd say it's worth neither your time nor your money. Get on a crazy 95% off sale, if at all."

,Recommended,315430,28724823,"Posted: 27 December, 2016",all,Eludium,"Polarityis a fun little puzzle game, whether you are in for some achievement hunting or simply want to face some brain challenges. However, note that this game's stages are nowhere near the level of other puzzles games such asPortalorThe Talos Principle. Most of the levels inPolaritywon't leave you thinking for more than 2 or 3 minutes, sometimes the solution is painfully obvious, making the completion of this game feel rushed, even though there are 20 levels attached to it.The goal of the game is to reach the end chamber of each level (similar to thePortalseries). In doing so, you have to make use of red and blue cubes in order to activate different mechanisms. In addition, you can change your player's ""polarity"" from red to blue and vice-versa. This is mainly useful because some walls only allow you to pass through them if you are in their specific polarity.We are presented with a poor attempt at a story, which will not matter in the slightest throughout the game and only serves as a filler. However, this isn't anything important if you don't care much about a storyline.Polarityis, after all, a puzzle game.The game looks pretty, visuals are nothing too impressive, but they're on point for its genre. Unfortunately, the game seems unpolished. There are glitches, some slightly unfinished areas, while the places which represent abyssal falls are literally... void, leaving the map in a lackluster state.The music is pretty much alright. Fortunately, there's a couple of songs attached to it, so the same tune will not repeat through each level.The store page of the game claims to feature a multiplayer factor. However, this is partly true. You can only play a local co-op campaign with your friend, on the same computer, using either a keyboard and a controller, or two controllers.Summary:Pros:+ Fun little game to kill time with and relax;+ Overall a nice simplistic approach to games such asPortal;+ Collectibles and achievements, as well as the co-op campaign, encourage replayability;+ Ambient music that fits the game's setting;Cons:- Some people will find the experience lacking, due to the easy challenges and small amount of gameplay mechanics; in addition, this may lead to a fast completion of the game, maybe too fast for its price;- Unfinished, visually speaking; the pits that serve as obstacles are pitch black, as if parts of the map are just missing;- Even though a multiplayer feature is out of the question, since the player base is pretty much dead, a more advanced co-op feature would be appreciated, letting players play with their friends, each on their own system;- Occasional bugs here and there;Personal rating:62/100 - Decent"

,Not Recommended,315430,16319049,"Posted: 11 June, 2015",all,MrNinjaSquirrel,"There’s a sad irony to how Polarity succeeds at being both bloated with ideas and creatively bankrupt.Every few levels it throws out a new mechanic - binary colored platforms, rotating switches, color changing portals, to name a few - but it barely gives time to show how they function before it decides to move onto something new. The constant stream of introductions to tools that are barely utilized keeps Polarity from ever managing to create puzzles that provide any sort of challenge.From the main campaign, to the coop levels, and even the bonus stages (which could have just as well been included with the other levels as they feel identical) every puzzle is agonizingly mundane and basic. Polarity mingles in tutorials from start to finish, as if testing my patience for repeating the same handful of puzzle types for hours on end, chuckling to itself at how cleverly it has hidden its simplicity by placing it within tediously large levels that have a habit of breaking halfway through and forcing you to restart.The cooperative mode itself feels like almost a misnomer, allowing two players to go through levels together but rarely if ever requiring they work together, or even giving both players something to do. Often one of us would simply took over completing a puzzle while the other trailed behind waiting for their turn to help, with a few instances of actual cooperation being the sole highlight of the game.There just doesn’t seem to be any point to Polarity. It exists for the sake of existing but in a post-Portal world and an increasingly crowded genre, it feels trite and uninspired. I could potentially see a lot of things from it being spun out into better games, but it’s hard to imagine that ever happening when what’s already here is so disinterested in moving forward.You can read more of my writing onKritiqal."

,Not Recommended,315430,24364665,"Posted: 16 July, 2016",all,NYKevin,"Sometimes, it isn't one big thing, but a lot of little things.  In this case, that lot of little things make me feel like I'm playing a university student's final project for their game design class rather than a Real Game That You Pay Money For And Stuff.Here are some examples, in no particular order:There appear to be at most twelve to fifteen different textures for the entire game.  Many puzzle elements appear to be deliberately constructed to minimize the number and complexity of their textures.  To the game's credit, what textures do exist are visually distinctive, rather than the twenty or thirty variations on ""industrial, brown, and ugly"" you will find in more than a few ""modern"" games.The game's plot appears on a series of simple dialog boxes, and appears to have nothing whatsoever to do with the gameplay except insofar as it dictates the names of a few puzzle elements here and there.The game presents dual controller/keyboard+mouse prompts everywhere, except for a few places where it displays controller prompts only.  It does not adjust the prompts based on the input method, nor is it capable of accepting keyboard+mouse input while in controller mode (or vice-versa).  It does (apparently) try to guess the correct input mode, but I only know this because it guessed wrong.The ""data fragments"" you are expected to collect are in many cases simply scattered about the level.  Finding them is an easter-egg hunt, not a puzzle challenge as with (e.g.) the stars in the Talos Principle.  This appears to largely stem from the baffling design choice to provide a fixed three fragments per (short) level rather than making them rare and irregular enough to be interesting.The cubes you can pick up do not respect the inertia of a moving platform.  If you drop them onto a (horizontally) moving platform, the cubes will stay where they are and fall off.The game has somewhat limited animation.  Buttons do not depress when activated.  Objects are destroyed by instantly replacing them with untextured particle effects.The menus are mostly static and not very pretty.  They do not take advantage of the high resolution of my monitor.  This is not to say they are pixelated or otherwise mangled; they just aren't all that pleasant to look at.The smoking gun, of course, is the ""readme"" on the game's main menu, which informs us that the game was made by a small group of people coding it ""in their bedrooms,"" whatever that's supposed to mean.  Ordinarily this would inspire lenience in me, especially since I paid a mere $1.50 for it.  But the note then goes on to exhort the player to purchase the game if they enjoyed it, which suggests to me it was intended for a demo and (accidentally?) included in the final copy.  Combine that with a complete lack of such a warning on the main store page, and I'm just not inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt here.Nevertheless, it is better than nothing.  Buy it when it's 90% off."

But after playing it through it's mostly relaxing puzzle fun. Instead of using portals you carry and throw little cubes to switches. There are also switchable bouncers and moving platforms. But most important are the red and blue energy fields and your color change ability. We know this from ""The Flip"". Well, the puzzles get more complex and challenging on higher stages.For example you must fall through 5 alternating colored laserfields. If you have the wrong color you die. In each level there are 3 hidden data pieces to collect. The Coop levels are no real internet coop (they are just local coop). But with an additional gamepad controller + keyboard they are quite doable on your own. Altogether very joyful."

This game is around 2 years old, but the release date has changed multiple times. The developers claim this is a steam bug, but it has happened too often for it to not be suspicious and the developers try to dismiss the claim too much without providing any reasonable evidence.If those business practices haven't put you off the game, then maybe the actual game will.First off, I will talk about the general gameplay and what you do in this game. This game is a first person puzzle game. There are 12 regular levels; 10 bonus levels and 15 co-op levels (NOTE: The co-op levels are local co-op and use 1 keyboard and 1 controller, so don't think about playing with friends online). This game hasFORCEDmouse acceleration. There is no way I, or my other friends who have put more hours into this game than I have, have found a way to turn it off. The developers are also lazy, and do not bother to connect planes of the levels, as seenherein level 9 where the walls and floor are not connected.The aim of the game is to solve puzzles in order to get to the end of the level. Most of this is done through picking up cubes and throwing them in receptors in order to activate certain things. There is also the 'polarity' aspect of this game in which you can change your 'polarity' from blue to red. For example, with blue polarity you can walk on red platforms and safely go through blue lasers. The opposite is true for red polarity. Some puzzles in this game are pretty fun to figure out, but most of them are incredibly easy.Now, the meat of the review: bugs.This game isrifewith bugs. To demonstrate most of the found ones, Siglamii and I have created some videos showing them. For some bugs, there is more info in the video description about the bugs:List of bugs in video formReset boostMoving during end screenLeftover developer toolsClipping with developer toolsFrame advance while pausingBuggy cube collisionCube boostLedge boostWall boostCube clipping through wallsHigh cube jumpingThere are also strange framerate bugs that exist. On any frame rates other than 60, jumping might not register, and framerate also dictates momentum and jump height to some extent. For example, higher framerates make you jump lower and make your momentum more sensitive. Setting the graphics to simple will limit the framerate to 60; setting the graphics to medium will limit the framerate to 30 (if in windowed mode) and setting the graphics to gorgeous will cap the framerate to your monitors refresh rate. There is no reason for this.I hope reading this review has persuaded you not to support the developers with their questionable practices by purchasing their shambles of a game.Thanks to Buttravage, MHFSilver, Dungeonfire, Avetixz and Siglamii for helping the speedrun community and I find these bugs and thanks to Siglamii for helping me with the review and demonstrating the bugs."

Alternatively, if you have a child and Portal is too difficult for him/her (or if he/she has a strong phobia of cake), then consider this game instead. Otherwise, save the money.Another Portal Clone without the HeartFrom a technical standpoint, this game really isn't bad. The levels are actually pretty well designed, especially some of the co-op missions. But if you look past the chocolately outer layer, you'll find that the game lacks the nougaty center that Portal provides. There's no real story, the whole ""hacker"" bit only manisfests itself in the naming of certain things, but has no bearing on the gameplay. And overall, the gameplay is quite lackluster.And honestly, I'd might be okay with having no story if it wasn't for the fact that the game is justsoooooeasy. There's no challenge. Once you get the hang of timing polarity switches in mid-air, which any competent gamer will have down by the fifth level, the game doesn't get any more challenging than that. The whole ""data-collection"" bit is also a bit contrived. Originally, they seems like optional collectibles that add some kind of difficulty, until you realize that they're necessary to progress the game.BreakdownProsNot too gimmicky, sticks with core mechanics pretty wellConsJust boring. It's uneventful, there's no story, the gameplay doesn't challenge the user. It's like flavorless pudding, there's nothing wrong with it, but why would I get it when there's all these other better tasing ones around.Had issues a few times where my character would clip out of bounds for no reason.

The Solo campaign went really fast like passing some of the easier levels in 40 seconds.  The Co-op was a different story - definitely required teamwork - & timing your jumps & changing color quickly was more work.  I'm the guy who mutes the music in so many games - guess what - the background music/sound in Polarity was actually good.  I don't really see the Portal comparison that others have mentioned - this game stands just fine on its own.So, once you've been through it all, I guess you could try to beat your times or something - I didn't see much replayability.  On the up side, 100% Achievements should be no problem for you.  Fun & very much worth the Bundle price.

This review is assuming you are buying the game at the listed price of $10.99. I have also 100% the game and my time in game is probably about 1 hours of idling so it is a pritty short game.This game clames a lot saying that it is the next portal ext. but it just is not. The main machanic of the game is to change your polarity between red and blue. You use this to pass through and stand on platforms and not get killed by lazers. That is about as indepth as this machanic gets. The other main machanic is using red or blue cubes that you move around that level to activate switchs that move objects in the level. The color of the cube has the same function of the polarity of the player you just cant change it at at anytime. In each level you must also collect 3 data fragments which are not that hidden.Pros:The 2 player part was not that badIf you can get it on sale it is very cheepSome levels were interesting and make the player thinkAmbient musicCons:$10.99 is way to much for a game that is aobut 2 non-interesting hoursThe puzles are not very interesting and get borring after aobut 30 minutesOutdated visualsThe puzles dont build on eachother very wellVery little story that should not even be thereYou can glich through some objects and the void is sometimes visableNot hard to figure out the puzlesLots of sniping cubes across the map and hopping you hit itThis game is not the next portal.

The addition of a multiplayer mode was a HUGE plus, and was frankly a lot more fun than the standard game, in my opinion.The viusuals get the job done, but they aren't anything to write home about. (Also, it didn't natively support my 1440 x 900 resolution, so that was kinda a bummer.)  Also, there are a good number of bugs that still need to be worked out, and frankly rip you out of the experience. holes in the ground that drop you down to infinity and don't respawn you unless you restart the level aren't fun, and I've accidentally fallen down more than one.In summary, I'd say to pick this game up when it's on sale.

Other annoying bugs include auto dropping cubes when coop partner dies, random rotation of camera when using gamepad (Xbox 360 controller in my case) while pressing nothing and no end game screen for coop campaign  (there is normal ""Next"" button which does nothing so you don't know if it's broken or what's happening)Difficulty- Sadly the difficulty is almost none, all ""puzzles"" are very straight forward requiring almost no thought. I'd definitely wouldn't call it ""demanding all of your wits and reflexes"" as devs do.Coop- It's advertised as multi-player game but it only contains local coop (which wasn't problem for me but it might be for others). Included coop campaign isn't really coop for most of the parts, there are few moments where two players must interact with each other to finish the level but otherwise it's mostly one doing all of the work while the other is waiting for partner to open the road for him (being a burden in short).Length- Both coop and single-player campaign takes only around an hour each.This might sound like very negative review but in fact it really isn't.

Unfortunately all of the levels currently included in the game are extremely short and easy. It's got a co-op mode which is local only but is easily beatable without a second person. In fact most of the puzzles don't even require the second player to solve. It's also lacking in a story, not a big deal for me in a puzzle game but they make a half hearted attempt at a story. There is 7 sentence worth of story throughout the entire game, do not buy this for the story.Ultimately this game needs better levels. The levels it has right now are very simple and you can beat all of the single player and multiplayer levels solo in under 3 hours.

76561198365236399,Recommended,315430,29866171,Posted: 11 February,all,Awai,"I love a good platform puzzle game and Polarity does so with a few additional aspect from other games.(2-11-17) I just started the single player game and plan on finishing it soon to fully rate the game itself. What I currently like are the elements the game mashes together. What I do not like is the lack of a background story. Maybe I'll get more story as the game progress?(2-12-17) So I finished the game via single player and I'm disappointed in the lack of story plot - the ending was very lackluster (in terrms of round and how the game ended).Two things that I can't exactly fully judge yet on are the placement of the data fragments and complexity/simplicity of the puzzle. Thus far, some of the data fragments are just plain simple to find and predictable. If I'm missing a fragment as I approach the end of the level (which hasn't happened yet), I bet I can just backtrack to the start and I'll see it. Some fragments require specific thinking/platforming navigation to get, but aside from that, not much of a puzzle to obtain them (hopefully they get more difficult to obtain?). IE: I found a fragment as I was trying to figure out which rotation to use and scrolled around to get a better view.Now that I have finished the game, yes. The fragments are pretty easy and predictable to find and obtain. The platforming isn't very difficult and this is especially so if you are not aiming to get the fastest time.In regards to the quality of graphics, it's fine. Not praise worthy, but also not terrible. I played the same level using simple and gorgeous and I didn't even care for the difference. I stuck with simple and didn't think I missed much out of it. I did notice the some graphics were slightly pixelated (not because many things were squarish) and not as smooth as one would hope for a game like this. Perhaps future versions will improve this. Also, pushing a cube against a wall causes its edges to disappear, which is weird.The sound quality was very soft, which proc'ed me to just play my own music instead.2-15-17So I just finished playing the bonus levels and I enjoyed them just as much. Definitely like these levels more as they were slightly more tricky to navigate and required a little bit more thought in the later rounds. All the rounds preceeding up to the later rounds were still simply and just fun to navigate through. The last round was a very disappoint round however. Completetly different to the previous 3 rounds before it. I was hyped up from those 3 rounds and then the last round killed the excitement. It's still the same lackluster ended (story) so don't get too excited for it - thinking it's the bonus levels and you might get a different ending.Last thing to do would be co-op...Overall, my scoring would be 6.5/10"

,Recommended,315430,22802310,"Posted: 4 May, 2016",all,CyborgJellyFish,"Not very difficult, but quite relaxing. Buy on a sale!More suitable for a younger audience, or simply to relax.The graphics aren't great, but to be honest it didn't take long to get used to. Considering the game has a cyberspace theme, you wouldn't really expect top quality graphics (or at least I wouldn't, anyways...) So they certainly stood out enough to be easy on the eyes for the duration of the gameplay. I haven't tried Multiplayer so I don't actually know what the player model looks like, so in my ignorance i'll assume it has the same minimalistic appeal.The audio for this game, I didn't really notice it. That isn't a bad thing - I knew when something happened, but it was more of a confirmation than actual sfx. It added to the feel of calm under pressure, and aided the relaxing puzzles through what could have been frustrating experiences if it wasn't for one problem......It was too easy. I finished the game (all data fragments) and all the bonus mission in 92 minutes. It was enjoyable, so I would recommend at a low price, but it certainly wasn't something that I had to struggle to understand the solutions. It took a few attempts to actually do some of the solutions, granted. Some of that was because of a slight issue with physics/momentum that I wasn't expecting. If you are on a moving platform, you will continue to move in that direction as you jump off it. This means that instead of jumping towards what you are looking for you have to account for a slight air drift. Which, again, wasn't difficult to understand, just wasn't as expected initially.I don't know if this game was supposed to be for a younger audience, or if I am better at this game than others. Personally I felt like the bonus missions should have been part of the main missions, but if the game was meant to be a little easier I can understand why the difficulty would be at a mismatch in that situation. There were 22 levels (including bonus levels) for Singleplayer mode, and I assume 15 for multiplayer - given there are 3 fragments per level and 45 set to CoOp mode. All the same, I was sort of expecting more challenging puzzles, but I didn't dislike the experience up to the end goal.I doubt this game would get a great deal of re-runs. The base price is not worth the content in my opinion. That being said, I got this game around 90% off (maybe more) and I certainly think this game would be worth it at a discounted value. I have seen this game on sale many, many times. So long as it is half price or better, I would say go for it. As it stands, however, my view is that the game should be around four times longer, with much more challenging rooms in order to justify the retail value asked. Or maybe include a level editor and allow workshop support, but that is likely above the developer's skill level judging by the content provided. Again, not a bad thing, as I in no way disliked the levels that I played, I just don't think that there isenoughcontent provided...PS - Technically, you can get this game at such a steep discount that you could sell the trading cards and make money, though if you are into that kind of thing you'd already know that without reading this review."

This game feels great for what I purchased it at for $0.50.  Now seeing the price at $11, it feels very lack luster.4) Co-op is couch co-op, no online co-op.  Which was confusing when I saw ""multi-player"" which I assumed meant online play, there is none available, so it was really mistagged.5) There are a few levels in which it is required that you die to progress, this came to a shock for me the first time, every time after it became the solution to harder puzzles.Final verdict, if you are purchasing this game while it is on sale below $11, then get it, its a good quick game to try and test your brain on, however if your not, consider waiting."

I 100%ed (all collectibles and achievements) the whole singleplayer part of it in less than an hour and a half.○ It's also pretty buggy, I managed to clip out of the map through a wall once without actively trying to do so.○ The movement feels really tedious - you can get stuck on a 1 inch step and have to jump in order to traverse it. The collision detection of jumping platforms is a pain, too, among other things.○ Then there's the thing with some of the puzzles... You know, in a puzzle game I like the idea to be ""spend some time figuring out what you have to do, then do it"" whereas here it's often ""see what you have to do right away, then spend 5 minutes trying to pull it off with the dodgy physics system and clunky movement"".○ Some gameplay elements don't add anything to the challenge of the puzzle itself, they merely serve as a layer of hogwash that can foil your efforts at any point (I'm mostly talking about the moving lasers).○ A couple times I didn't get any hints on newly introduced mechanics (e.g. rotatable jump pads or cube colour changing portals) so I wondered what the hell I'm supposed to do with a blue cube and red socket.All in all it's not an awful game but if I had paid the full price for it I'd feel robbed.

Polarity mechanics boils down to switching to correct polarity when jumping on colored platforms. Puzzles are trivial and most of the play time comes from traversing unnecessary long distances on foot while constantly holding your ""run"" key. On a few levels it's literally easier to kill yourself (to reset your position) instead of walking back and forth.There is no narration or plot, aesthetically this game is meh, visually it's unpolished even, from time to time you'll see misaligned textures and z-fighting.Speaking of play time, single player campaign (not counting bonus levels) takes around 30 minutes to beat, but then it asks you to replay it and 100% it to unlock a ""Story 02"", which is actually a ""Thanks for playing"" message written on a black screen.I guess I could recommend it if you get it very cheap, but this game also requires you to go through extra hoops to be playable on some configurations.If you're playing on a 120Hz or 144Hz monitor, open your GPU drivers control panel and switch to 60Hz.Apparently if your framrate is too high, game from time to time doens't register jumps and this game has a lot of platforming. You run towards next platform, you press the jump key, hear the jump sound but there is no jump, you just fall off the ledge. This is extremely frustrating. You can't set the refresh rate in game settings. Judging by the forums, someone tried to contact devs about that issue but it's still not fixed.

However, I do feel the game is a reasonable purchase, especially at a discount of -50% or more. Gameplay is simple and enjoyable, while the game has many rough edges and limited content.The biggest issue I can see is that the game is a sloppy Unity project. The launcher has limited resolution options, and the Steam overlay would ghost on the black borders. Level assets have cracks and seams, buggy lighting, and a major lack in refinement. Some puzzles can be broken by tricks, especially in co-op.Turrets are not solid, and can be ran through. Cubes above a door can be grabbed before the door closes, trivializing later sections.Co-op can be fully completed as one person flipping between keyboard and controller. Later co-op puzzles seemed to have extra cube-locks with no function, with no lines to show what platform was affected. Polarity has the hallmarks of the first game from a company, flawed but passionate.I enjoyed the game enough to bother with co-op and put up with the sloppy level design to 100% the game. The current content is around 4 hours, with levels consistently taking 3-6 minutes to complete. I liked that timing and pacing, as I could play the game while waiting on friends or multiplayer queues. Puzzles were satisfying and reasonable, and only the cube transformation field (yellow particles) was confusing, with no introduction to even show it exists. The developers could make several improvements, but the game was quite enjoyable. The -96% sale was amazing, but I think the game is worth more than that. Polarity is a decent puzzle option to spend a little time thinking, but this gem is quite rough."

Too short and too easy for puzzle game lovers, and there are not many people online anymore, so trying to play co-op is pretty much a bust without a friend who has the game (unless I am crazy and you can switch between co-op perspectives without a partner, a la 'Half Life: Decay').Puzzles are mostly straightforward -- the earlier ones take longer than the later ones on account of the later ones not being that much more difficult to complete, plus you are pretty much done learning the mechanics. The data is mostly just hidden in unusual places, rather than in an area or locked behind something, and they are not really all that hard to get to (save one of them, which *was* cleverly hidden).I was honestly kind of let down. It looked neat enough, and besides consistent difficulties with getting caught on the lips of platforms, it played perfectly fine.You can get it if it's on a big sale (and maybe get a second copy to play with a friend, if it's cheap enough).

I'LL EXPLAIN WHY LATER IN THE REVIEW)I don't know what I expected for four dollars (though I got it for 19 cents), but apparently this isn't it.GameplayIt felt way too short, but that was probably just because they kept repeating the same puzzles/parkour stunts over and over again, such as when you have to switch polarity in midair to stay on/avoid the platforms/lasers. There were about 5-7 actually unique puzzles.Also, the mechanics weren't being used enough, such as the on/off switch and the rotation buttons. Even the polarity was mostly just used for either the midair-polarity-switch stunt or fields that blocked certain cubes.Plus, the data fragments were placed in awkward positions and it didn't feel like they had anything to do with the puzzle at hand. 3/10EnviromentThere's no real plot aside from being informed that you are hacking into some super important company (although it doesn't look like you're in cyberspace). We are never told what this company is, what they do, or why we need to hack into it.The scenery never changes, either. We aren't showed where we are before we take up the offer, we aren't shown how we get transported into cyberspace, we aren't shown how we get beamed out once we finish the mission, and we aren't shown where we are when we get the massive supply of credits.And it's completely clean with no props or broken walls anywhere, despite the numerous video games that showed us that messier was better. Portal had the famous Rattmann dens, Portal 2 had the facility beat up and destroyed in many of the chambers, Gateways had the laboratories broken into by a messy criminal, etc. And just because it's in cyberspace doesn't mean you can't make some areas briefly be replaced with nonsense code before automatically repairing itslef or have the lights take a while to turn on.Final note: There's just too much black and dark gray on the walls, floors and ceilings, especially in the later levels of the game and the bonus levels. Wouldn't hurt to make it half-light, half-dark like Portal. 2/10Co-opI do not have any friends who are willing to come over to my house just to play Portal 2 minus the portals. Either way, I don't think it would be that much of an improvement. 2/10The store pagedoesn't contain that much content from the real, finished game. As a matter of fact, from the looks of it, the prototype was better than the real thing. It contains some final levels with a better balance of dark and light, and one level that was two from the finished product put together.The description contains numerous flaws. ""One of the most fun puzzle/platformers since Portal."" is a little bit too egotistical and not very true. ""Polarity takes it to the next level, demanding all of your wits and reflexes."" is hardly true at all. I finished all of the singleplayer levels with all of the fragments in around 114 minutes, and I only stumbled across 2 levels that required reflexes (along with the numerous midair-polarity-switch stunts) and they were pretty easy. ""Full-featured local co-op campaign."" I am not sure about. 2/10OverallThis game is hardly worthy of your money, even if it's only nineteen cents. 2/10"

People are quick to jump on the bandwagon when a glaring fault is revealed, especially when it’s from a prominent source that shouldn’t have let it slip through. Some of this bias I think comes when people compare a game to another, completely different game. If it’s a sequel from the same publisher, then sure, there’s an expectation to live up to, but I hate seeing games compare to others that have been made by different minds.The name Portal gets gets thrown around a lot when Polarity is mentioned. Why? I’m not sure. Aside from a few aesthetics and a reference in the name of an achievement, there’s not a lot between the games that they share. This is the other side of what I was dribbling on about in my opening paragraph. Attempting to piggyback on the success of one title only really works if you’re a copy-cat or a cheap clone. To me, Polarity is neither and is a title that should be considered to, and does, stand on its own.The story is a hacking… blah blah… collect data… it’s irrelevant. It’s just a pointless layer to the rest of the game. The real meat is in the multiple levels where you solve puzzles and navigate obstacles. Each level has three glowing ‘data chunks’ that you have to find if you want to get that 100% completion. The puzzles vary in difficulty and were mostly quite entertaining, right through to the end. I have to grumble about the level design near the end. Some levels had glaring faults such has misaligned walls and floors as well as gaping holes though to the ‘void’ outside the world. It felt like designer got tired and started to get sloppy.I played the co-op mode split-screen with a friend and we had some good fun, but we were glad when it ended as it does get a bit tiring. Didn’t try the VS mode, as we were tired of it by that point. It’s a good game even if it’s a bit plain and a little rough around the edges."

,Recommended,315430,16375234,"Posted: 13 June, 2015",all,Red Ram,"Polarity in a sentence: Polarity is a first-person puzzle/platforming game where you, well, solve puzzle and... yeah.That was Polarity in a sentence (And a half, I guess). Now, it's time for the real review.Basic Info:Polarity, greatly inspired by Portal, is a first-person puzzle platformer. You can play singleplayer or multiplayer. Either way, they're the same kind of puzzles.List of Basic Uses:-Cubes: Used to activate switches, platforms, laser walls, etc.-Polarity: You switch your Polarity (Your color, some say) to jump onto colored platforms, or to get through a laser gate without dying.-Gold Lasers, A.K.A. Color Changing Lasers: These are lasers that you can throw cubes into to change their color from either red to blue, or blue to red.-Data: These are collected to unlock more levels throughout the game and eventually unlock the bonus stages. There are three per level.Other Notes:This game is completly Xbox 360 controller compatible without any configuration needed. There is also a split-screen multiplayer that has its own campaign.Story:Honestly, Polarity doesn't really have a story at all. However, you can peice together a basic story from what you're told.You're a hacker trying to break into one of the greatest firewalls in the world, trying to collect data so you get your reward that was promised to you by an unknown person/thing - 10,000,000 Credits.Gameplay:Polarity has you jumping from platform to platform, switching your Polarity (Or, some may call, your color) and carrying and throwing cubes everywhere. What I'm trying to say is that you may have to get through aredlaser gate, so you have to switch your polarity (Which, by default at the begining of every level, isblue) to, obviously,red. That's different with platforms, however. With platforms, you must switch to theoppositecolor to get across, which leads to switching polarity in mid-air. What I'm trying to say is that your Polarity and ablility to work with cubes is all you need to beat the levels.Polarity has 14 levels in singleplayer that are not too tough at all, but can actually be a bit fustrating for reasons such as ""Crap, put the cube in the wrong spot - Oh, there it goes. Bye cube. Just gotta run back to the other side of the map again to get a new one..."" Most of the levels are short, but every now and then, you'll notice repeating concepts in the levels. For exaple, you may have just completed a level where you had to through cubes into switches and now, you're throwing cubes into color changing lasers and then putting them in switches. May notsoundsimilar, but once you play, you'll know what I mean. That, however, is not too much of an issue.Upon getting every Data Crystal in the singleplayer campaign, you unlock the 10 bonus levels. These levels are justbarelyharder then the normal campaign, which is easy once you get the hang of how things work.Difficulty... That's an issue. This game isn't hard by all means. It's just fustrating. Like in my example above, you can easily throw your cube the wrong way or just barely miss the button for it and *POOF*! It's gone. You'll have to go back and get a new one. Anyways, back to difficulty - It's too easy, in my opinion, to be a puzzle game.WAYtoo easy. The Data Crystals aren't even cleverly hidden at all. You can easily get all of those. You'll also find yourself breezing through this game. For example, if you have even the slightest bit of knowledge as to what you're doing, you can get through levels in 1-2 minutes each. The singleplayer campaign (Bonus levels included) may only take you about an hour and a half. That's how short and quick this game is.Ah, multiplayer... I can't say that I LOVE it, but I like it. You and your buddy are robots (Sound familiar much?) and you must work together to solve puzzles similar to the normal puzzles, except this time, it's even harder. This time I mean it. It's not ""I GIVE UP!"" hard, it's just... Up there, I guess you could say. The Data Crystals can easily be passed without even knowing it, and they're hidden in better spots and actually take you a minute to get them. I would have to say that the multiplayer is better than the singleplayer just because you have a friend with you and you both get to slove the puzzles together.Conclusion:This is a first-person puzzle game that's highly inspired by Portal. Sure, it's not always fair, but it comes through for sure. I would just get this game while it's on sale, as you'll be glad that you didn't waste $5.00 on this. I'm not saying that this is a bad game, it's just I don't see it being worth $5.00. Not everyone looking for a good puzzle game will be satisfied fully, but I still love this game.To conclude this review, I give Polarity a7/10. It could be better, and it wouldn't be that hard."

Not only is this excellent value (I would also probably pay the full price if I hadn't got it in a sale) but a great game.It is a first person puzzle game, and you have to use the cubes and pads to work out how to solve the puzzles, not only to complete the levels but unlock data, as the storyline says that you are a hacker.The graphics are great, the controls are simple and there is a co-op mode for an extra challenge. There are some really nice ideas and some great puzzles in this game. I would definitely recommend this for anybody, and it also doesn't put too much (if any) strain on your computer.

Nevertheless, it is a small, modest game, but still a rather pleasing one. The game has decent graphics and smooth gameplay, although the motion blur was a tad disorienting, but that could be disabled. The instructions are simple, and the game is pretty straight forward. Moreover, the puzzles are insanely basic, they are too easy and lack anything remotely complex or challenging to them. The levels feel particularly identical and short. Furthermore, there's no real story, although that being said, a story isn't always necessary. One thing that really ticked me off was that the multiplayer that it supposedly has, is nonexistent, and you must have a controller along with a keyboard in order to play coop.To sum up, the game is very short and lacks many characteristics that make a game good. Considering that the game is actually eleven dollars and not the 20 cents I paid for it, it definetly isn't worth the money. However, I do recognize that polarity has a very small development team and appreciate the game for what it is."

It doesn't have an incredibly engaging story to it (in fact, save for a short text introduction at the beginning of the game, there's no story to it at all), but at the same time it doesn't really need one. The objective of each level is to use colored cubes to activate corresponding gates and switches to get to the end-level warp while collecting data fragments.HIGHS: --Gameplay is fun and engaging, albeit a bit bare-bones.--Bonus levels and Co-op campaign add much needed replay.--The music (or I should ambience) is soothing without becoming repetitive. Accompanied with the easy-on-the-eyes visuals, the game is actually quite calming (in the good way).LOWS: --The levels aren't incredibly challenging. They're enough to make you think, but none will really stump you or leave you stuck.--There's a couple important details the game neglects to inform you about. For example, later in the game you'll encounter yellow gates that, turns out, change the color of whatever cube passes through it. An attentive player would be bound to figure this out on their own eventually, but the more casual player may not be so quick to catch on (especially when the FIRST none-red/blue gate you encounter without being informed kills you).--The game is FAR too short, especially for the asking price of $10.99 (The single player campaign can be finished in less than an hour, even if you're not the greatest at puzzle games). The game could've, and SHOULD've, been much longer; especially with the multitude of potential puzzles the aforemention yellow gates can bring to the table.BUY or BYE: I say buy, especially if you're a big fan of the Portal series or puzzle games in general. Polaris is not worth the default $11. A good default price would be $5 (perhaps $9.99 at the most), but certainly not $11. HOWEVER, it IS a fun puzzle game that should be experienced, and for the current sales price of $0.54, you can't go wrong!"

While it had a unique gameplay idea of polarity switching, it really could've used that mechanic way more than the Portal-esque cube on button style gameplay.Cons:-SO SHORT! Even with the bonus levels, it only took me about an hour and a half, which is why I recommend it only if it's on sale.-Not much of a con, but it was really easy the whole way through.

Beyond being a first-person puzzle game with discrete puzzle rooms that require you to unlock switches to progress to the next puzzle chamber, the comparison between Portal and Polarity is miles apart. The game isn't exactly challenging and the narrative is pretty bare and forgettable.Althoughportals are absent, Polarity does introduce some original, although very simple new mechanics to add to the ""drop off box at checkpoint to open door"" puzzle genre, mostly relating to the ""Polarity"" of the player. You switch your polarity between Red and Blue to get through shields and jumping platforms. Also included are co-op and competitive splitscreen modes, but I did not try those out.#Very short and easy, with little replay value. Great for those who are hankering for a small, small dose of Portal-like puzzle gameplay. Pick it up when discounted at 90%, not worth otherwise."
,Not Recommended,315430,31891334,Posted: 21 May,all,Masa,"Polarity is a first person puzzle game quite heavily inspired by Portal. Instead of creating portals, you have the power to change your polarity. You can freely pass though barriers with the same polarity whereas barriers with opposite polarity will block you.VisualsThe models and textures are extremely simple and the lighting model is quite dated.The game doesn't support 16:10 resolutions. There's no FOV slider either and the default FOV is rather annoying.AudioThe sound effects are very basic and for some reason the default volume is quite low. The soundtrack is fairly decent at least.GameplayThe gameplay is rather lackluster. The polarity mechanic doesn't really lead to interesting puzzles and it basically feels like the game is an extended tutorial. It would have been nice to see some more complex puzzles.To complete the game you need to collect 3 data cubes in each level. This feels like a tedious requirement as hunting for the cubes is not particularly interesting and they are often hidden behind corners or in alcoves.DifficultyThe levels are all rather easy.ControlsThe controls are passable but by no means great. It's quite common to get stuck when using booster bads.Rather annoyingly some button prompts are only displayed for a gamepad even when you are playing with a mouse + keyboard.Story and WritingThere's very little writing or story and none of it is particularly interesting.Bugs and GlitchesUsing the Steam overlay caused some visual glitches.Final VerdictPersonally I found Polarity a rather bad game and I wouldn't recommend it. The visuals, audio and gameplay are all rather poorly done and the puzzles aren't particularly interesting either.The game is rather short too, it only took me 1 hour to complete the campaign levels.

The main gameplay, at least, is similar to portal. You use cubes on pressure pads around each puzzle room, in an attempt to reach the exit. There is the added task of collecting data nodes, on the premise that you are a ""hacker"" stealing them from a vault. The story doesn't play too much into this except at the beginning and end of the game.The puzzles themselves are fairly easy. There were a few that I had to think about solving, but most were solvable in less than 2 minutes. For reference: I was even able to complete the co-op levels as a single player, and the entire game to 100% [with all data nodes collected] within ~3 hours.The music doesn't always play in this game, it fades in every now and then with a calming ambient piece. It is very nice, but I don't think there are many tracks that rotate. There isn't any voicing in this game, and beyond text that flashes on screen at the start of the game you are pretty much left to your own devices to figure things out. The graphics in this game are very nice. In some places the shadows look a bit odd, but mostly it looks nice. It has a sort of cell-shaded look, with textures that look fairly minimalistic.To summarise this: Despite peoples insistence to compare this to portal, beyond some similar gameplay mechanics it isn't very similar at all. It isn't overly challenging, but if you want some simple first-person puzzles to wile away an afternoon, this is the game to go for."

Nothing game breaking though.Unfortunately I don’t have any friends with this game, so I can’t say anything about the co-op side of it.

,Not Recommended,315430,33209848,Posted: 3 July,all,Catratio,"From what I understand this game was made by two guys at home with some help from a handful of other people. Being that it's from such a small crew I really hate to put up a negative review because it's not a bad game, but it's also not worth the $7 asking price. Considering during a sale you can get Sleeping Dogs for $5 or Just Cause 2 for $2.50, both AAA games that will each last you 50+ hours, this one for more money that is only 1-2 hours long is a tough sell. Even Portal is only a 2 hour game and goes on sale for 99 cents.First, the graphics are good, everything is clear as to what it is, and controls are fine. The problem is it's a puzzle game with no real puzzles. The concept of the game is you can change between having red and blue polarities to pass through red and blue energy fields or lasers. There are red and blue cubes you grab to place in the corresponding colored ports, which usually activate a platform or a bounce button. But beyond that the mechanic doesn't really go anywhere. It's very straightfoward: when you come to a blue barrier you turn blue to pass through it. Red cubes can't pass through, so you have to find a way to get it around, but usually that just involves standing off to the side and throwing it around the barrier to the platform, then walking through yourself. Two rooms in the game involve rotating the room to get to new areas, but that's the extent of that, ONLY those two levels have that mechanic. I would have liked to have seen it used more and for more complicated puzzles.Each level has 3 ""data points"" to collect, but most of the time they are sitting right out in the open or in the corner of a room with nothing stopping you from walking right up to it to grab it. There are only 11 levels in the game and then you win. You get 10 more bonus levels, but they're not any harder and still only take an average of 4 minutes to complete. There are about 10 or so more co-op levels but you either need a second person or another controller to do them.I'd hate to say it comes off more as a tech demo than a full game, but the fact is most of the mechanics were not utilized to their full potential. It's a good start but the game just needs more meat and challenge to be a satisfying puzzle game. It's well made, just lacking content. Considering what 7 bucks can get you, it's better spent elsewhere. On sale for a buck or less then why not, it's still alright for those two hours."

Hearing that must of made the game sound really bad but I ignored it. I read the description of Polarity, claiming thatit's the most fun Puzzle game since Portal(I even saw a comment on the greenlight page that the dev(s) don't even know what Portal was).Gameplay was just too simple & it lasted only for an hour on my side, the first time playing Portal brought so much confusion that it was thrilling, this game just wanted me to go to sleep. I also looked around the levels set up & I saw so many flaws that it looked like it wasrushedfrom development just to gain revenue. The worst part about it is that it has no decent story, Portal's story was so fasinating that I want to find out more about its connections with Half-Life 2, Polarity states that your a hacker thats trying to access a virtual vault when these levels don't look anything like a firewall.In conclusion, If you want a better puzzle game at a cheap price, Get something that was made perfectly & looks challenging (even if it has mixed ratings).

During a Steam sale, this♥♥♥♥♥♥is like two cents. Everyone knows how large your♥♥♥♥♥♥♥is correlates to how many games you own on Steam. But this one game now, I was pleasantly surprised with.It's Portal. Portality. You know. The meme game. The one with the potato and the cakes and the lemons you squeeze in people's eyes.You might not recognize it, but that's only because this is the Walmart brand. This is Great Value: Puzzle Platformer. It has red and blue squares instead of circles. Also they're not portals. But it's like the same exact thing, honey. It's not Lucky Charms but there's a green man on the box. Eat your cereal.Portality barely manages to get by doing what Portal already did so much better. It has the puzzles in there. And there's different colors. Those do something. There's quite a bit of different elements to interact with, actually. Cubes that activate switches and launch pads and all kinds of♥♥♥♥♥♥ The main function, your ""Polarity"", is purely titular though. You can switch between Red and Blue, and that changes which surfaces you can walk on or pass through. But it's introduced in the first few levels before all-but disappearing until the last few levels, bridged with cube puzzles and♥♥♥♥♥♥While playing through the 20 or so levels that made up the main ""story"", which by the way sucks♥♥♥♥♥ all I could think to myself was ""wow, this game is a cluster♥♥♥♥"". A cluster♥♥♥♥ of puzzles. It's not put together the way Portal was. Portal was genius. Portal was all about portals and how many unique kinds of puzzles could be made with them. Everything always came back to using portals.Portality has all these ideas and it just throws them all at you at once. It's like you got drunk and picked up a chick you thought was way hotter at a club, then you wake up with her serving you breakfast in bed and asking what you want to name the baby before she goes dress shopping for your wedding.The feature that the game is named after gets shoved to the side for generic puzzle platforming that struggles to form a cohesive whole.It's a decent play, and has some good co-op features. It's definitely not a bad game. Off-brand Pringles are still Pringles. As long as they're not BBQ-flavored, they're still edible.It definitely passed the time, and there's a decent amount of content as long as you buy it on a sale when it's like 99% off. The game by itself regular price is 10 whole dollars. And that's clearly got to be some kind of elaborate joke, since I finished the game in a day and it wasn't even that great. It's not like it's particularly impressive graphically either. Generic Tron♥♥♥♥♥ polygonal♥♥♥♥♥piece of♥♥♥♥♥There really is nothing but the gameplay itself to look forward to with this game. The presentation is incredibly basic, all the way down to the ""Conglaturation! You have completed a great game!"" message you get for earning 100% in the main game.There's really no narrative or story to what's going on. You're basically ""an elite hacker"" that has to ""hack things"". And all of the cubes you throw around are apparently inside a computer. And when you beat the game it says ""thank you for hacking everything"". That's it. Whoever wrote the plot to this also wrote Obama's Russian hacker story. There were Russian hackers. And everything is their fault. The end.Portal had some solid lore behind it. This game ain't got♥♥♥♥♥♥ You can't even meme it. There's nothing to meme. There's no decent quotes. And a game without memes is absolutely worthless.Still, considering most of the stuff you find in the Steam dollar bin, it's not too bad. It's definitely functional, it's not 8-bit, and it has something of merit to look forward to, even if it's not exactly done as well as what it's copying.I honestly thought it'd be some cheap♥♥♥♥♥Tetris thing when I started it up the first time. All I saw were squares and thought ""well, this must be some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzle game"". But it was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥3Dpuzzle game. That's nice.As far as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ discount games go, this is one of the best ones. They tried a little. It was good. I know most people only use Steam to play CS:GO, but if you ever think to yourself ""hey, I wonder if I can waste a dollar on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzle game"", look no further."

It could be made into a great game like Portal and Talos Principle if it had a better story (instead of just about 5 lines of text telling you what the story is) and if it was better technically.It is extremely buggy. You'll fall through walls, you'll have the cube you're carrying fall out of your hands for no reason. I played the coop mode with a friend and what he tells me was ""it feels like a school project"". And he's right, it doesn't feel like a finished product, it feels like some prototype from 2008. There are a lot of strange design choices, from the ugly menus, to some objects behaving really strangely (like the fact that in coop, at the end of every level there are two spots to exit the level, and it won't end the level until the first player is on the left spot and the second player on the right spot, switching spots won't work) (or the fact that you can walk through gun turrets instead of having to dodge their bullets).Still, if you like puzzlers, you could still like it (I liked it, even though I don't feel ok recommanding it since it doesn't feel like a finished product). I don't think it's worth the 10$ they are normally asking, but if you can get it on a sale like I did it could still be worth it, but be ready to have your patience tested, not so much by the puzzles as by the bugs. It took me 3 hours to get through all of it (single, coop, bonus levels), but it could have easily taken me one hour less if I hadn't had to deal with all the bugs and weird design mistakes."

You must use your polarity changing abilities to maneuver abstacles such as lasers, gates, bridges, and more. For example, depending on the color of a laser, you either can get through it, or you cannot. If it were a blue laser, you would have to change your polarity to blue to get through, and if it were red, you would have to change your polarity to red.The story is a bit awkward, considering this game is an intricate puzzle game with blocks and jumping around, being a hacker trying to get data from a computer network is not a very fitting story.Another thing I wanted to mention was that for me, personally, the pricetag of $15 is asking a bit too much, as I would say $10 or less is a more reasonable price, but since I picked this game up during the 2015 Summer Sale, I cannot complain because I paid 19 cents.Overall, this is a great game, with puzzle elements similar to the Portal games, and other unique elements, but the price is asking a bit too much for what it is, and the story does not fit this game very well.I would recommend this game to anyone who wouldn't mind selling two trading cards for this 19 cent game (when it is on sale)."

However I've got to say the puzzles arent near as clever and interesting as portal. I averaged about 3.5 minutes per puzzle and finished both the main game and the bonus in under 2 hours. I have not tried the multiplayer components though.I'll say it is pretty fun and somewhat interesting and well worth a few dollars for a short game. This may seem like a disservice to the developer who im sure put an insane amount of time into the game. Clever puzzles are really REALLY hard to make. But clever is required for an engaging puzzle as well.

There were no times when I had absolutly no idea what to do, but there were one or two times when it took me a minute of looking arond to figure out what I had to do. I like how you can get to the end of a level, but realise you have not colected all the data, causing you to have to backtrack. The one complaint I have about this game is that there are not enough levels. If this game were updated to have many more levels, better music, a slightly steeper learning curve, and some voice acting, I would pay ten bucks for it.

The puzzles basically involve launch pads, switches, and platforms. There is one component where you switch between red and blue “state?”. The point of this is that you can pass through walls of your own color but not the opposite. This is well used as it also incorporates floors and platforms meaning you have to really think about your next step.

(By the way, first-person platforming is really not enjoyable, especially when the controls handle very poorly.) Indeed, the only challenging puzzle in the entire 90 minutes worth of single-player content, found in Bonus 04, doesn't involve the polarity mechanic at all. It DOES involve lots of clipping, very questionable cube physics (there's no friction between them and moving platforms? pressing a rotate button when they're not in the rotating area makes them fly into the air???), and a plot that's not worth the 20 seconds it takes to click through the expository slideshow. Only buy this game in a bundle, like I did, or if it's 20 cents and you're super desperate for ""puzzle"" games."

I saw some of the other reviews and it seemed like it wouldn't be too bad and wanted it just for the achievements. The game is a little buggy and doesn't explain all of the different colored fields well. I also don't like games that try to force you to get a certain amount of the collectibles just to progress. Once you get to a certain point you find out you can't play anymore unless you take the time to go back and collect enough of the strange green glowing auras. I noticed them originally, but didn't collect them just because I wanted to hurry and finish the game and be done with it. The game is ok, and is probably worth the $0.99 but I wouldn't recommend paying the full price.

,Not Recommended,315430,31843546,Posted: 19 May,all,Lukewalkerz,"Rating: 3/10Polarity is a game that didn't seem that bad to me at first when I played it, but ended up disappointing me at the end. My main gripe about the game is that it's just too dang easy. There were a couple of moments where I had to step back and think a little, but for the most part, it was more of a hide and seek game than anything else.Your main goal is to collect these data fragments through the level (3 per level) and then leave the level. You would think that they would strategically place these fragments in such a way so that you'd have to overcome some obstacle to get them. But instead they hide them in random places such as right around corners as a ""Gotcha! I bet you wouldn't turn around here!"" or in plain obvious sight where it's literally in front of your path. There was only one or two times where I had to solve a puzzle to obtain it.The game is also very short with only 11 normal levels, 10 bonus levels, and a bunch more levels that are co-op only (so I never got to play those). That seems like a lot, but the levels are so easy that you blow through them very quickly. The longest level I played took me around 8 minute to beat with most of them taking just 2-3 minutes. As a result, I beat the 11 levels in around an hour.After I finished the first 11 levels, I reached an ending mini story (really just a slide show of 5 text images) and I thought that was the end of the first chapter. I was ready to play more and the game to pick up in difficulty. But nope. That's the end aparently. Overall, the game comes off as very amateurish - which isn't bad, but I wouldn't pay more than $2 for the game."

I'd say that a price tag around $5 would make it better.Second off is the fact that it doesn't make much use of it's main mechanic.As the name implies, the main mechanic is the previously mentioned polarity. However, the game mainly consists of throwing and moving cubes around, with little to no polarity use, wich is dissapointing (I should also mention that polarity only affects 2 objects, lazers and hard light walls).Overall, i think that with a bit of more working around the main polarity mechanic, and making the levels longer and more complex would make this worth the price, but as it is now i don't reccomend getting this normally (On sale, however, it might be a good way to spend an hour or so)On the plus side, TRADING CARDS!

I ended up paying something like $.50 for it or whatever, and for that price, it is somewhat worth it. So, what's the game like? Well... simple. Way too simple. The game really just consists of you, the player, running around collecting these ""data fragments"" and getting to the end goal. Maybe you jump up a lift, or activate a switch, but overall the package feels in complete. There are some ""puzzle"" elements in the game though. For one, you have a strange color changing ability (how original). You press a button, and you change from red to blue, or vice versa. Neat ain't it? Well again, this is mostly used to cross walls or bridges, it mostly is half-asses stuff that you're gonna forget. Also there are these colour cubes. Red and blue also, you chuck em across the map and they activate things... how fun and original. So how do you progress? Well as said before you collect these data fragments, which are placed around the map creatively... not really. In the easier levels you can find them right in front of you, and instead of solving puzzles to get to them, it's pretty much a scavenger hunt. Luckily they're almost always poorly hidden and easy to get to. There is a healthy amount of levels but you'll probably get through them in less than 2 hours. Co-op levels are very dumb, as they don't really give you an incentive to actually work together, and also it's local only, so in reality you can just complete everything yourself and just pick up the other controller and finish it. There is also a mode where you literally just chuck cubes in your opponents goal for 30 seconds or so, also local only.How about some positives? Well there is some at least. The game is very easy to run. Your grand-mums computer could probably run it well. The music is quite nice, and that's it. WOW.This game is very mediocre at best and it tries to be portal but it just ends up as some generic indie game that the developers spent 1 day making and tried to make some quick money off it. Don't buy it for $10 or $.50 because it's really just a waste of time. And a even bigger slap in the face is that the fact that they updated it two years after it released, and you expect a huge content update or something and all they do is add a couple of songs. Wow just f*cking great guys.Don't buy this, go buy a CS skin or find something else to waste your money on."

I had some small execution issues of the sort that's to be expected when playing a first-person game with a controller, and I assume there wouldn't be a problem at all with mouse and keyboard.To the devs: Learn to make your platforms connect, and for your ramps to be smoother next time. Through most of the game it's a forgiveable annoyance, but it's very frustrating on the last level. Great game otherwise."

You should buy Portal of you don't have it but if you do and have finished portal several times this is a good relaxing game. Have completed single player and bonus maps. Got all those achievements.

But I think this is a really interesting game. While it does have some similarities to Portal, it is just an indie game and it isn't right to compare the two. I thought that this game was incredibly smart with its level design. Sure, a lot of the levels are not that difficult, but there are a few that really make you scratch your head (especially bonus level 7 and co-op level 9). I bought the game when it was on sale for $0.19, but I would honestly pay the $4.99 for the game.PROS-Co-op campaign has by far the best and trickiest levels; really fun to play with a friend-The regular campaign and bonus levels are fun. Most are easy to finish, but difficult to completely master (get all data pieces)CONS-Some levels are very easy, making the game kind of short-The DDOS Attack Versus mode was not as exciting as I expected-No online multiplayer (co-op or versus)Also just a helpful hint for controller input mapping - ""horizontal controller"" refers to the left analog stick (the one moving your guy) and ""vertical controller"" refers to the right analog stick (the one moving the camera)."

It's a fun little puzzle game, with nice level design, but suffers from numerous issues that would lead me to avoid recommending it.First off, this it's a really bad console port. The options are practically useless. I'm unable to change my controls, or adjust the visuals besides monitor resolution. The keyboard/mouse support isn't well implemented either.To make this worse, around one third of the game is the multiplayer campaign, which isn't even playable. The game only supports local split-screen. It has absolutely no network support, not even over LAN. This effectively takes out a massive chunk of the game.To top it all off, the game feels very clunky, and isn't terribly interesting either. You end up spending most of your time playing just trying to move around the stages, as opposed to actually solving the puzzles.

I've only played the single player mode, so all this is based only on that mode (no idea what co-op is like).The game takes a few things from Portal and Antichamber as well.The game mechanics, the launh pads, the blocks and the way blocks activate platforms is well known from Portal while the graphical style, the very simplistic, bold style with a thick black outline around certain objects looks pretty similar to Antichamber at times.I found the puzzles to be pretty easy to complete. Near the end the puzzles actually became more challenging, but yeah, that was at the end. Definitely not on the same difficulty level as Portal's chambers in my opinion.Having said that if you find Portal too challenging then this game might just be for you. Bare in mind though that you're going to want to play this for the puzzles and not for the story as there isn't much to it. Also if you're thinking about buying Portal but you're uncertain as to whether or not you'll like that kind of game then you may want to get this first given that it's quite similar in terms of gameplay and (at the moment) dirt cheap.Summary: For 20 cents the game is more than worth it.

I found Polarity and bought it (with Soundtrack) for 24 Cents. I booted it up and saw a crappy interface. But as I started the game, I realized I found one of the best puzzle games I've ever played.Did you ever wonder what a futuristic puzzle game without a plot would be? I tell you what I'd be. It'd be POLARITY. But no plot is necessary for this awesome game. To be honest, there is a plot, given on Level 0. But be careful, You might miss it if you blink.I was very sceptical about the concept. It revolves around switching modes, so-called ""Polarities"". You have 2 Polarities availiable, RED and BLUE. And you can switch between them freely at any time. The first three Levels are Tutorial Levels introducing you to the concept of polarities and switching them. There are many new elements and mechanics I have never seen in any game before, like the Cubes. Like Polarities, there are two of them. Blue cubes activate blue switches and - you guessed it - red cubes activate red switches. It also introduces you to the concept of collecting Data Packs, which kind of work like Marios Star Coins.The goal of the game is to get to every three Packs in each levels and finish the stage, of course. There are 14 Levels, 10 bonus levels and a challenging cooperative mode. The price of 10 Dollars is - sadly - too much for this game. I recommend it to anyone who can get it on Sale.My final rating is a Tangram out of ten.Like Tangram, It seems clunky and edgy, but if you get the hang of it, it is a pleasant and fun experience.

How this works in the game is that if you have a blue laser fence up, you have to change to the blue polarity to get past. Alternately, if the floor is blue, change to red polarity so that you can walk on it. The only real challenges are when you have to flip back-and-forth between them quickly, such as when you’re jumping on alternating colors.The whole thing looks and feels like a college project with dreadfully simple layout, mismatched layers that caused me to continually “trip” every time I walked over a line, and simple challenges.

Nope, theres no way to get one back, no way to respawn one, worst of all.... Theres no checkpoints to combat this. In my opinion this game way made by a single person, in Unity, in a week. Funniest thing is, its price. $11 USD. Yes, 11 (thats ELEVEN) for this.And then you have people (like myself, I suppose.) comparing it to Portal and Portal 2. No, just no.

Thisgamehas no: story, dialouge, no backstory, no lore, no... nothing. But levels that look like they were made in Blender, or Unity. A menu that for some reason feels like it was copied and pasted from a flash game. Physics just don't feel right for something like this, I mean jumping off of a moving platform and flying 30 feet in the wrong direction, is just... not right for this type of game. So how do people think its ok to compare this to Portal?!Man, I must sound like a hypocrit.From what I've read, the devs are inactive. Last update was months in the past!

In theory, it goes for five dollars - already a low-risk investment - but in practice, you can generally pay more for a stale gumball than a copy of Polarity. I thought about typing this entire review without one reference to Portal, but the comparison is unavoidable. As a first-person puzzle-platformer that achieves diversity in level design without throwing too many game mechanics into the mix, Polarity succeeds in many of the same ways that Portal did, albeit on a much smaller scope. But to consider Polarity a decent poor-man's Portal is to do it a disservice. By utilizing a mechanic that is less visually jarring, Polarity makes similar gameplay more accessible for casual gamers, and while it is an easy play-through for most gamers, it provides solid and balanced entertainment throughout.I don't think the premise can be laid out any more clearly than in the first sentence of the game: ""You are a hacker.""

Supposedly, you travel a mainframe seeking out protected data for the agency that hired you, but a more-salient way to look at the objective is ""Pick up the green glowy things and get to the end of the level."" Each level has three bits of data, and while you can move on without collecting all three, the game does acknowledge 100% completion. Generally speaking, the data aren't too hidden, but it is worth it to explore the big, open rooms that comprise most of the game world to see what you can find.In Portal, you used the titular portals to play with basic physics to complete levels. In Polarity, the concept is much simpler: you switch yourself between two color ""poles,"" red and blue. The levels contain structures made of red and blue light. When your polarity matches, you phase right through the object; when your polarity does not match, it is as solid to you as the room itself. Alternatively, if the object is a laser and your polarity does not match, you die. Challenges sometimes require changing polarities while in motion, and even while in free-fall, so that you pass through one object but not another.The levels also include red and blue Not-Companion Cubes. (I am a masterful and original comedian. Nobody has ever made that observation before.) These cubes are subject to the same rules of polarity that you are, and they can also power platforms and other machines when placed in circles with outlines of matching color. You are not able to directly change the polarity of a given cube, but there are green windows through which you can launch the cubes to change them. Occasionally, you will come to obstacles which you can pass through, but which your cube cannot.The gameplay is incredibly smooth, and the sense of size and scope is nice. For levels that are largely wide-open rooms without too many moving bits, I was worried that after a time they would feel bland and empty, but instead I often had a sense of awe, looking to platforms three stories up that I knew I could find a way to. I did, however, want more from the cubes. In most cases, the cube was simply a proxy for a button or switch, and I felt like more could have been done with switching the polarity of individual cubes, or getting a single cube to help you in multiple ways.Ultimately, the game is a success, providing a short journey through a world that needs little explanation, gives adequate time to learn the mechanics, and increases the challenge as you go. By the end, it is perhaps a bit too short and a bit too easy, but even if you breeze through all of its main and bonus levels, it provides entertainment along the way. Well worth the five-dollar price point - and if you find it at a discount, do not hesitate."

The graphics are simplistic, there's only one in-game music track, but it's a fun short game nonetheless. The levels were a little too simple, with obvious solutions -- and I ended up completing the game by accident.Near the end of ""chaper 1"" I was told I needed to complete the last level to unlock ""chaper 2"", except there *is* no chapter 2. Finishing the levels in chaper 1 gives you a text-only cutscene before dumping you unceremoniously back at the main menu.

If you enjoyed Portal, you'll enjoy this, but it would be doing the game a disservice to call it a Portal clone; it has its own ideas and systems that are well thought-out and smoothly executed throughout.The game is void of any real plot or humour, but those things aren't needed here. It's a simple little game and quite a relaxing way to flex your puzzling muscles for an hour or two, without any extra baggage forcefully added on. I've not been able to enjoy the co-op campaign just yet, but if the singleplayer is anything to go by then it must be a lot of fun. There's certainly potential for a sequel here and I hope to see more from this developer in the future."

However I played with a keyboard and mouse.The bonus levels are a bit more difficult and will take a bit more than a couple glances to figure out.I sadly did not have a person available at the time to play the second player for the co-op mode.The CO-OP is split screen! Would be great to play with a friend and a couple controllers.I was able to find all the data points without too much difficulty, I felt I spent just the right amount of time looking for them.The music is a bit retro 80's sci fi electronic soothing keyboard type style which fits well.Movement feels pretty good. Physics are great. I think the programmers even did a bit of nudging at points to get you to land where you need to be without frustration.You can tell a big studio did not make this game, but I still enjoyed solving the puzzles.If you have an afternoon to kill and like puzzle games, I would definitely pick this up."

Lots of graphical mistakes - Getting your texture edges lined up with your geometry has been level design 101 stuff since the DOOM .wad days, gang. The game is low budget and it looks it.

,Recommended,315430,22190836,"Posted: 1 April, 2016",all,Raccoon,"PLEASE NOTE BEFORE WE BEGIN!IONLYsuggest you purchase this game if it's on sale for $5.00 or less. While I did enjoy the game, it is by no means worth their $10.00 asking price. I rate the games I play depending on if I feel it was worth what I spent. I got this game for approximately $1.50 and feel it was worth the money.Puzzles!This game isn't a brain teaser. You won't spend hours and hours on difficult puzzles. The game flies by extremely fast because almost all of the puzzles are very straightforward and quick to solve. Which is good and bad, depending on the player. If you're like me, you want to be challenged and feel clever at the end of a puzzle game. You want to feel like you really accomplished something. This game doesn't give you that at all. This is more of a relax and play some easy puzzles with the SO when there's nothing on TV. In being relaxed and straightforward it does a very good job. The gameplay doesn't feel rushed and doesn't require a lot of concentration like Portal does. There are only two or three puzzles that actually require you to move quickly or decisively, the rest of the time you can just mosey your way through.Story!What story? I'm sorry, but that was pretty well pointless. I ended up making up my own story as I went along to make it a bit more interesting than a few lines of text at the beginning and end of the game.The Goal!I also couldn't figure out if the end goal was to finish the puzzle or collect all of the data nodes. It seemed like I could complete the puzzle just fine and then it wasn't until much later that I got a splash telling me I needed to collect X more nodes before I could go to the next level. For me, they were just the nodes on that level, so I'm not sure if it changes depending on how many I have or not. I guess collecting nodes is the end goal since it sounds like I can't progress without enough, but the game itself isn't very clear on that at the start since I finished a puzzle or two accidentally without all the nodes.Gameplay!Let's start at the very beginning. The Tutorial was a little on the light side. I don't know if I missed a bit of it or not, but you can click on the spawning spots for the cubes and it will spit out another one if you accidentally throw your current one out of reach. Like I say, I don't know if I just missed the text or if it wasn't there, but it was a key aspect of the game I missed out on for a good seven or eight levels before I accidentally stumbled across it, restarting the level each time I lost my cube. Besides that I suppose it served it's purpose. Told you how to move, pick up/throw, and the primary objectives. There were no ways to check/change/reset keybindings from inside of the game and NO WAY TO CHANGE THE MOUSE SENSITIVITY! Holy cow it was WAY too high for my taste and I couldn't seem to find a way to turn it down until I went into Razer Synapse and lowered my mouse's sensitivity manually.The keybindings for the controller were extremely awkward as well, and like I said, no way to change them from inside of the game itself. (It doesn't help that I usually don't use a controller.)The sockets where you put the cubes are buggy as all getout. Some of them will snag the cube from half the room away, some will only grab it if you literally hit it directly, and others will grab it and then drop it or pull it toward them and then let it go to fall into the black abyss and make you walk all the way back to the spawn for the cube. They're extremely inconsistent. For instance, on one level, you have to throw the cube across the room and hit a moving socket. I must have wasted a dozen cubes trying to get it. I would get it, and then it would just bounce off of the socket and leave me raging. I managed to hit it directly two times before it finally grabbed it.The way the cubes interact with the jump plates is also buggy. Frequently (35-40% of the time) the cube will literally just plop down on the jump plate and sit there. Then most of the time you aren't even able to get the cube back from the plate, particularly if it's a turnable jump plate, you'll just sit there spam right-clicking trying to pick up your god forsaken cube while the pad does a rendition of Dead or Alive's only good song.*The walls are made of tar. When you strafe into them or walk perpendicular to them when using a controller (Because I guess you're always strafing with a controller?) they will stop/slow you, like getting stuck on fly paper. They do the same thing to the cube, freezing it in place and yanking it out of your hands, frequently over a pit, next to a pit, or in a pit.♥♥♥♥ing pitsThis might seem minor, until you find it happening constantly. It does ware on your nerves. I assume this contributes a bit to the lack of physics when it comes to the cube bouncing/rolling. When you throw it against a wall it's as if you threw it full force into a stack of pillows.The cubes also have a tendency to disappear randomly after hitting something hard (usually after falling a long distance.)In the end, to play this, you need to be relaxed. You can't be taking it seriously (as I was at first), because the little bugs will drive you absolutely batshit.Now for the good aspects of the gameplay!Throwing is awesome and it adds a good mechanic to the game, making it less of a Portal clone.  The puzzles were diverse enough to keep me interested. They weren't all carbon copies of the last, and the introduction to new mechanics every couple of levels made for a nice little changeup once in a while (Such as the Crazy Cube Color Changerpatent pendingor the rotating jump plates.) The variety (Red and Blue) of cubes added a small extra level of complexity, rather than a one cube fits all approach. If the creators were to do any more work, I would love to see green and yellow cubes implemented as well.The Sounds!The footsteps and music are extremely repetative. I muted all sounds after half hour and turned on some Devildriver. If there were more variety in the music and footsteps it wouldn't have bugged me as much.Co-Op!Before I get into the Co-Op. I did the co-op, all of it, by myself. I plugged in a controller and it took me about forty-five minutes. I did it mostly for the challenge and to see if Co-Op were as Co-Op as advertised. To be fair, there are four missions (If I recall correctly) that were genuinely difficult alone and designed to be done with two people playing. Most of the others were pretty well a solo run with a tagalong that would throw a block up to a high place once in a while. None of them really required any interactive coordination between the two players. Really the only time I would have needed someone were the levels where you have to avoid blocks/lasers at the same time. There were noOH MY GOD I'M GOING TO DIE IF YOU DON'T HURRYmoments.OVERALL!It's a solid start for something that could be pretty cool if the dev(s) decide(s) to keep going and expand. But like I said at the top, I would only recommend it for five bucks or less, ten is a bit too much for an hour or two of entertainment. It's no portal. But it's better than most early-access ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that's on steam right now.*The song in question"

This is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ business practice and I do not support it.For the sake of objectivity, I'll leave my original (positive) review below. Just take it with a pinch of salt:I was pleasantly surpirsed by Polarity. I picked it up in the Developer Alliance Bundle for barely more than a pound, and therefore didn't expect much for it. However, the gameplay left me coming back for more, though sadly there's only around two hours of content, not counting the co-operative gameplay which I've not done yet.The one thing I'd criticise about the game is that it feels a bit stuck-together at times, with a main menu that leaves a lot to be desired alongside some minor physics bugs. This does not affect gameplay, however.If you like portal style games, you'll like this. Had me hooked more than QUBE."

The puzzle mechanics are kinda interesting and will, at times, make quick use of them. The controls are as smooth as you expect from a recent game.Now for what I didn't like. The biggest problem is that all of the puzzles revolve around finding ""data."" To complete a level and progess to the next one, three orbs of data need to be found. The problem with this is that the difficulty of all of the puzzles come from finding the orbs on the board. They are almost never hard to get to, just hard to find. This would be okay if the developers realized this and made each level interesting. Turn each board into a unique easter egg hunt that reveals something about the story. Show something about my mysterious empoyer. Leave notes on the wall next to an orb that shows what each piece of data is. Have comments of code that reveals something about the owner. Make each nook and cranny rewarding to explore, even if it doesn't have an orb. As is, however, each level is like an easter egg hunt where all the eggs are hidden in 4 acre egg carton: everything looks the same until you stumble upon the green orb.For a game that is ""demanding all of your wits and reflexes,"" this game is surprisingly easy and short. As mentioned earlier, almost all of the difficulty comes from finding all of the orbs. It's reminiscent of Knuckles' levels in Sonic Adventure, which we all know as everyone's favorite part of everyone's favorite game. What makes matters worse is that sometimes it is brutally apparent that the developers placed the orbs as an after thought just to squeeze three into each level. Each puzzle takes less than 5 minutes to complete, except one that I spent several extra minutes exploring the level looking for the last orb. Turns out it was in the exit room. Why even bother?Minor gripes: some small steps can't be walked over, they need to be jumped. At times the physics is unpredictable. For example, a cube won't move with a moving platform when placed on it. Also, the throwing mechanic sometimes makes it feel like I accidentally skipped part of a puzzle (might just be me, though). Less than one hour of main story, maybe another with extras, and maybe another with co-op.I like what they tried to do and the mechanics are cool, but the environment is unrewarding.TL;DR: The game controls well and has a neat idea. The execution is sub par, unchallenging, and short. Not worth $10. If you catch it on super sale (whatever 1-2 hours is worth to you), go ahead and try it."

The game doesn't really lose much if you do, and you are able to fully immerse yourself in the music that way.- Some of the level design choices aren't particularly fortunate, like how you can't always be sure where the platform you're standing on ends, or how deadly pits and normal ground are so hard to tell apart. Also, the chambers tend to be too dark and big sometimes.- 2 or 3 levels require quickly changing the polarity mid-jump, which is a pain to accomplish sometimes.- The singleplayer campaign is pretty short, and together with the bonus levels, it can be completed in about 3 hours.

Not at all!Although polarity is first person puzzle game that takes place in a test chamber type environment the game defineing mechanic (switching the polarity of the player/cubes) provides unique gameplay. The puzzles use walls and lasers that only allow objects with a certain polarity to go through. The moving platforms, launcher pads, and gravity add enough momentum that creates a faster pace that requires some quick thinking. To progress to the next level you have to get to the end as well as find three chunks of data. This aspect was a tad diapointing because the game relies on the player not looking in alcoves or corners to hide datachunks. Not game breaking but could be a pain. The game is very short, I haven't tinished it yet, but just over an hour of play got me over half way through all of the single player maps. The coop looks promissing, not only for the additional maps, but there  is also a verses mode. Note that multiplayer is split screen.

I don't think it detracts from gameplay too much but with the timing component it seems like this has potential to frustrate speed runners.The difficulty is obviously subjective and I understand that it can be difficult to strike a balance here. I think the game would benefit from the addition of more challenging puzzles, either by developer addition, or support for community creation.The campaign and bonus levels felt a bit short overall. Obviously there could be replay value for people wanting to improve time overal but without a leaderboard for friends this might be rather niche.Overall, I like the game and recommend it for people who like relaxing puzzle games."

Using only your intelligence and a few colored cubes placed in specific locations on the map, you run and jump through 11 stages in story, 10 stages of bonus levels and some stages in Co-op (I admit, though, I never tried Co-op). While simplistic, the challenge of collecting the data chips makes it a little more exciting.

Where it happened most? The tunnels leading to and from every level.Blocks can disappear behind walls or flat out disappear for seemingly no reason. You also stop holding the block if you are holding it close to the wall, for some reason.Platforming sections feel like you are being punished for no reason, with instant death pits in the middle of the room when you could have just made more floor and jump distances that flip a coin as to whether or not you actually stick to the very edge of the platform you are expected to jump on to.Some gameplay features are never explained. If you had to search how to even begin Level 10, you know what I am talking about.Overall:You shouldn't expect anything great. The biggest puzzle of this game is figuring out why the floors and walls of this place are screwing with you.

That is, if you have played Portal-esque games before.In a lot of negative reviews you can read that the game feels unfinished. While it is true that the graphics look kinda ugly for a 2014 release, I personally didn't expect much more with this being an Ouya-port. On the other hand, gameplay-wise I don't really see where the complaints are coming from. I never found myself in a deadlock due to bad level design (not that I looked for one, but yeah) and it never felt like I would be fighting with the controls or anything. Throwing boxes around often takes a bit of trial and error, but it didn't reach the point of me getting frustrated or anything.The Levels, again, are fairly easy, but they do have a nice progression to them with the bonus levels, unlocking after the main campaign, being the most interesting ones.Story-wise, it's pretty forgettable. Something about hacking a secure computer system and extracting sensitive data, but it could really be anyting as it never comes into play in the levels themselves.I guess I would be more harsh to the game if I had paid full price, but for the current asking price of 99 cents, I got what I was looking for."

Besides not being original, it's not that fun anyway, also too short. The plot is a joke ""you are a hacker, win the game and I give you money"" ""you won the game, have the money, and we will hire you to do more of the same"", there's no plot at all in the game besides intro and when you beat the last level, which is literally just the text I said but without being simplified. There's a lot of obvious to find bugs and levels that were designed in a rush and are flawed af. Examples: You can force a red cube through a blue laser wall by pushing yourself against it, which is pretty gamebreaking, I wasn't even sure if it was a bug or not at start, how could they let such a bug in the game. If you stand in a part of a level where you can spin the walls with a button, and do it, you will get stuck in the wall while it spins, and when it stops spinning you go flying upwards (and stop being stuck)I admit I didn't try coop yet but I don't think the experience will be any different.TL;DR Go buy Portal instead"

(if you wanna refund you just press help in the top left corner of the screen and then you wil se polarity and then you just press it and it asks if you want to refund). But my opinion is that this game is very fun it is even funnier in co op. :DPS: Games are fun :D

You are able to switch between red and blue which is necessary in order to complete puzzles or walk through certain objects.If you are saying ""This is a portal clone"" Yea technically but worse. In each level there will be ""data"" which you would need in order to unlock more levels. There is a data counter at the bottom right corner. You will know where a Data is hidden most of the time as there will be a green light on that location. Green light could be seen below the floor tiles/walls/ceiling and even after you have picked them up. There will be puzzle cubes around which you would need to open certain area's.There are collectables available in each level.Scenery is bland.You are able to grab ""puzzle cube keys"" through a platform.The feet sound will get annoying after awhile as this is the only thing what you would be hearing.You are able to skip dialogues.Has ingame tutorial.Game has glitches.There is no manual available for incase you forget things.Game is easy and boring on the same time.Levels are short.""Data"" that are hidden in area's will have a green glow in their surrounding.Other things.Only worth getting with a discount.-------------------I Give this game a 2/10"

The art is plain, there's almost no story, the controls are clumsy, and the puzzles aren't clever. The main set of levels are over in about an hour. There are bonus and co-op levels, but I just can't be bothered. Maybe this is someone's first attempt at making a game in Unity, in which case, good for them. As a consumer though, it's not really worth playing."

If you are looking for a comparison, think Portal- just without a story, any dialougue, and with a less interesting gimmick.What is the big gimmick in Polarity?  You can switch your color between Red and Blue and that in turn lets you interact with the red and blue elements in the level in different ways.  Red lasers won't kill you when you are red, you can walk on red platforms when you are blue.Nothing about this game is inadequate in any way, it just feels somewhat bland.At a low price though, I still have to say its a solid game for fans of the genre.  If you don't have a lot of experience in games like this though and aren't feeling an itch for it, go play Portal instead."

On the other hand, if you prefer more complex puzzles, or don't like puzzles much at all, you might not.Polarity is a first person puzzle game similar to Portal (the objective is to exit the room by activating switches and the like), with the main difference being in the titular mechanic. Basically, some objects interact with other objects depending on their polarity. For example, red cubes will only activate red switches. You can also change your polarity at will for various effects. This mechanic is used in some way in every puzzle. The puzzles themselves have data (the game's collectibles) hidden throughout, and the main challenge comes from collecting all of the data. Data will also unlock new puzzles on the level select, as well as bonus puzzles (Note: data is not required to play most levels, but you will only be able to select most levels after meeting a data quota. For example, if you play through a level without meeting its data quota, you will be able  to proceed to the next level if you don't return to the menu; but if you do, you will only be able to select levels with completed quotas to begin from.).If I had to complain about one thing it would be that the game is pretty short. There are only about 20 single player levels. To be fair, the game does have a coop mode as well as a player vs player mode, but both of these are only local, and require a pad and a pal to play. As such, I've yet to try either (I'll place and edit here if I do-Edit: the multiplayer content was easily the most enjoyable part of the game for me. the puzzels are similar to those in single player, but playing them with a friend [or in my case a brother] makes the experience much more fun. the pvp mode is also enjoyable even if it is very simple[both players throw cubes to hit switches and score points. the player with the most points wins]. That said, even with the multiplayer content the game is only a couple hours long [I finished single player twice, we finished multiplayer once, and we played pvp more than I thought we would]). The game also doesn't have any story or characters to speak of; and while the graphics and sound work well enough, they don't really add that much to the game.But in the end it all comes down to one question. Do you like puzzles?"

,Not Recommended,315430,32754137,Posted: 24 June,all,Blind-mute,"I completed the 'campaign' in 36 minutes. There are about as many bonus levels as there are campaign levels, so basically the entire game's single player content is 90 minutes max.That would be bad enough, but the game is also the most buggy, unfinished mess I have ever seen on Steam in nearly a decade of using the platform. Sometimes you will fall through the world and have to restart the level. Sometimes, the developers forgot to give some walls a hitbox, so you can just walk through them randomly. The cubes will often clip through walls and fall off the map.I would not recommend this game at the $0.69 price I paid for it. I would not even recommend playing this game if it were free. At the full price, it's a complete joke. Stay far away."

There are so many things wrong with it.The only story you get is some text at the start (and probably at the end but I never finished the game). There's nothing that keeps you in the story along the way.The story itself is awful. It really adds nothing to the game.The physics suck. There are a lot of things that just don't work. In-air movement is probably the worst part.There are more glitches than there is story. There's at least one glitch on every single stage i played. It's not a finished game.The game looks really bad. If you care about how the game looks at all don't play this. It has worse graphics than an N64 game. The menu is probably the worst part. It looks like something you'd see on someone's first attempt using a game making software.Tl;dr: this game is not worth getting even if it was free. Every aspect of it is awful.

,Not Recommended,315430,35258475,Posted: 28 September,all,KingOfBritains,"EDIT: 144HZ MONITOR USERS BEWARE. If you have a high refresh rate monitor sometimes you'll try to jump, make the sound, and not actually jump. If you have a second lower refresh rate monitor, or temporarily lower the refresh rate of your current monitor the game will jump consistently. This is an extremely odd bug and I wonder what sort of spaghetti code the developer put in to cause this bug.This game would probably be worth $5 if the game were polished a little more. I spent $0.69 on this game, and even that is worth more than the game to me in its current state. I was only able to play through the first few levels before having to quit due to not being able to jump consistently.Pros-Game runs well, which comes from how simple it looks.-The levels I played seemed designed decently, however the data (collectibles, there's 3 in each level) locations were boring and uninspired.-Boost pads felt perfect.-You chuck cubes like you're 5 olympic shotput medalists put together.Cons-Lack of meaningful options in game. The only useful ones are toggle on music/sfx (separate) and sensitivity.-View bobbing.-JUMPING IS INCONSISTENT. This is the thing that really killed the game for me, there is a focus on jumping and when you miss 1 in 3 jumps and you have to jump 7 platforms in a row, you just want to quit the game. I have found that if you attempt to jump at the wrong point of your bob while walking/running, you will hear the jump sound, but not jump, in fact, this happens while standing still too, making me think view bobbing is on a global timer or something.-Forced Vsync. This is honestly pretty minor because the game runs so well.-Mouse movement is bad. I can't tell whether or not it's the vsync or if there's built in acceleration, but I have input lag (probably vsync) and my mouse doesn't go where I want it to on fast movements.-If there is a ledge that's 1 inch high, you have to jump over it, you don't automatically step up.-If you tab out and tab back in your mouse will be on the screen, this is minor because opening the menu then closing it will fix this.If the developer fixed the jumping issue I would probably change this to a recommendation with the caveat that you should only buy it while on sale."

I bought another copy for my wife so we could play it together. When I tried to setup a multiplayer game I found out it is only local multiplayer. You have to play on the same system/account and it requires the other player to have a controller.Also, while I really enjoyed the game, I bought it at a discounted price. I don't believe it is worth the current $11 asking price. I have bought many better games for half that. So, if you do decide to check it out, watch for it to go on sale."
