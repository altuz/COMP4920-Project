,Recommended,315440,12404693,"Posted: 7 October, 2014",all,Hellius Pelican,"In terms of a port I must admit then Tron:Evolution is a bit of a nightmare, if you wanna get 1920x1080 resolution you're going to start using .ini files with mixed success and, while it works for me on windows 7 I'm hearing a lot of mixed things in terms of what works for who, so while one can hope the modding community will work on all this it is by definition a bit of a mixed bag.The thing is (having completed the x360 version) what hide behinds that nightmare is a fun game. Clearly inspired by the 3d Prince of Persia games it's a fun romp through the early world of Tron:Legacy with more information on Tron's corruption, the birth and death of the ISOs, Clu's purge, and how Quorra made it out in 1 piece. Even referenced in the film itself this game actually feels relevent to the universe and canon of Tron in a way few license games ever do.The campaign itself is pretty basic and standard fare for this kind of game, lots of free-running, lots of combat (that is basic but nice and flashy and with a few interesting mechanics like disc varients and damage multiplayers depending on if you are free-running while attacking encouraging moving while fighting), and some scripted light-bike sequences; it's functioning if uninteresting with some stand-out levels and some amazing visual nd sound design that keeps you going through an average experience as Daft Punk music tends to do (and yes there's a lot of Daft Punk).However this game has one big trick up its sleeve....The multiplayer (once you can find people) is absolutely beast! Now while you can do a single bot match in the standard arena mode before it transfers to an online lobby (there's a few odd decisions regarding bot availability) the main multiplayer only maps that allow people, light-cycles, and tanks can create some truly unique experiences with people jumping out of bikes to parkour into health pickups while throwing disks at oncoming traffic. It is truly amazing if there are people on, and thus is the biggest problem...Tron: Evolution is a dead community with noone playing, the games best component's rely solely on people and they are genuinely worthwhile experiences that essentially define why I do recommend this game as opposed to saying that one should be indeifferent to it unless a tron fan in which case you should already want this! With that in mind I have created a steam group that I plan to add weekly play-sessions so that we can all bring back some of that light together. The multiplayer is something that makes this game so unique so one can hope that this gives life back to it even if only once in a while. If you're okay for an okay to good game with the risk of boosting it up to a great one again together then buy it and join me, because this game is great together, we just got to bring that together bit back!Join us onhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/TronEvo(also cheers for reading :D)"
,Recommended,315440,13259216,"Posted: 6 December, 2014",all,Gunmetal Buffalo,"A great example of a movie tie-in done right. It's a bit like God of War meets Prince of Persia.Two things if you're thinking of buying this game: Be prepared to play with settings and .ini files in order to get this game to run the way you want. Second, do NOT play the game on Hard mode to start with. Enemies will kill you in ~3 hits, they have much higher damage and health intended for a subsequent playthrough. When you first start the game you won't have any upgrades, so expect to be destroyed in Hard mode or multiplayer. It's not that the multiplayer is unbalanced or anything, it's that upgrades are shared. The single player upgrades give you more health/energy and unlock more of your disk modes. Without those, you're at a disadvantage against any human player who is further along in the game. Once you get a handle on the single player unlocks/upgrades, everyone's on the same level bar their loadout.Bear in mind that the multiplayer is mostly dead at the time of this writing. I hosted a bot match, one player joined and completely obliterated me because he had already unlocked everything. It's definitely *worth* bringing back to life by joining a community group and organizing games, but there's no guarantee that this game will ever get popular enough to jump into an open game at any given time.The single player is very fun, though it may not sound exciting on paper. Half the time you'll be performing simple parkour through the level, then when you arrive at the next combat arena you spend the other half of your time fighting groups of enemies. New mechanics are introduced gradually, as are new ""modes"" for your identity disk.The controls and targeting work well; it takes a little bit of practice to get a feel for the movement animations, but once you get an idea of what you can do the game really flows between acrobatic moves and attacks. In order to regain health and energy (used to perform heavy and special attacks), you must break off from your relentless assault to parkour across special surfaces and objects. With your health or energy refilled, you can then launch yourself into the air and fling your disk at the enemies, hitting hard and bringing yourself back into the fray. The heavy emphasis on making use of the environment and objects keeps the gameplay fresh, even though the levels are all variants of ""blue city populated by orange bad guys"". Each new combat arena is set up with a new challenge and a different set of moves to regain health or energy. You'll be too busy diving in and out of combat and frantically parkouring to get your health back to notice much else.The multiplayer is extremely cool, allowing players to do all the things they've always wanted to do in the Tron universe. Parkour and disk-based combat make the transition, challenging players to deflect, dodge and parkour around each other while disks fly in every direction. In the large maps, pressing a certain button will make your character leap into the air and generate your own light-cycle. It's possible to drive normally or make use of 90 degree turns, as you have seen in both movies. You can even throw your disk from the light-cycle to take out enemies as you drive by or to attack other light-cycles directly. There are even multiple models of light-cycle that you can choose between, each with different stats. Tanks can be brought into the battle by capturing certain points on the map, turning the multiplayer matches into beautiful spectacles where players are leaping on and off of light-cycles, flinging disks at one another. Where single player upgrades give straight stat increases, multiplayer unlocks provide a wide range of buffs usable in custom loadouts.I'm loving this game, it was well worth the price and may find new life via multiplayer on Steam. It's worth buying for the single player and bot matches, even if the (awesome) multiplayer never really catches on."

I have nearly completed it twice in 1 day mostly because I'm trying to find the collectables I missed first time round & to unlock & level up more abilities/loadouts. The controls are good & the story quite frankly is a lot more engaging than the movie companion Tron: Legacy.I've yet to play the PC multiplayer but when i played it on PS3 it was fun I can't imagine it would be any different on PC.I highly recommend getting this game if you either enjoy Tron or just general Cyber Sci Fi genre."

Games for Windows Live has not been a problem for me anymore, and multiplayer works fine like it did before. I should note i'm running Windows 10 and it works perfectly. The game itself has quite some flaws such as audio inconsistency, support for up to only 1600x900, and actors not working properly (rarely), but overall it's a fun game to play through and manages to create that TRON atmosphere while playing.The real gem hides in the multiplayer feature of this game. There are arenas where you can have disc wars, light cycle battles, or even both at the same time against other players. There is also different gamemodes such as capture the flag, bit runner, and control points. Unfortunately, there are not many daily players for this game right now, however if you manage to get a group of friends or host an event, I can assure you it will be a very fun experience.I would rate this game a 8/10 and recommend others to play, as well as the multiplayer as it's one of the most fun things to do in TRON: Evolution."

The fix for me involved uninstalling PhysX and reinstalling the latest version from their website. Maybe that fix can help other people too. Now that I'm able to actually play the game, I've changed my recommendation to positive. It's not a perfect game. The controls are a tad wonky and the resoltuion is a little off. But if you're a fan of Tron Legacy I would for sure recommend it. The combat is fun, the story thus far is already off to a great start, and I'm overall having a fun time.Previous: I would love to give this game a positive review, but I can't. Not until I'm actually able to play it. For some reason this game has severe trouble with Windows 8/Games For Windows LIve. I'm not totally sure of the issue, but I'm not the only one having it. I've been trying to launch the game since I bought it with no luck. I don't want to slam the game, but I do want to warn people who are thinking of buying it. For some people it works, and hopefully things will get fixed so I can play it and change my review. But for right now, I'd do some careful checking before spending the money on the game."

The negative reviews are because of the second part of that sentence.   Games For Windows Live is required, but what installs with the game is the version as of this game's release date in 2010.   Both it and any nVidia PhysX drivers you have will need an update to work, and you'll have to uninstall the G4WL that installs and install a fresh newer install.Once I had that done, the game was a blast.   First two chapters and already driving down a crashing building on a lightcycle and doing battle using tanks.  The Parkour is so-so; it would be great, except you can tell it's a port; that tell-tale ""why is my badass computer lagging"" sensation appears now and again.I play this game in 3D and I will say it's great as far as visually.  Many games don't properly support that, but seeing as Tron Legacy was a smash 3D hit, they couldn't have not.   You'll need 3dVision from nVidia to do it.The actors are all there, but don't get too excited.   Olivia Wilde clearly did not do her own motion capture; that woman walks like silk across velvet, but her character here looks like a nerd at a school dance doing the running man.   If there was an actor that needed proper capture in this game, it was her.Now to the danger.   Real danger.   As the game continued, it got more laggy.  And more laggy, It was in weird places too, where you'd be mid-motion and the screen would freeze because it was having trouble loading its resources properly (bad in combat).   After I quit, my computer behaved, but when I restarted, she wouldnt' come back online.   CLU must have escaped the grid and had his way with my Master Boot Record because I just spent 2 hours with the UBCD's data recovery suite and a Win7 install disk fixing it.The crazy thing is, I think G4WL's install caused two new partitions to appear (FAT32) that were reporting as 2.5 Petabytes in size.   That, or CLU really did copy the whole damn grid and brought it with him.   Maybe it was the Isos?  All I know is for a brief moment I had petabyte drives showing on my little 120GB SSD and it was fun to pretend that was reality.Recommend, but back up your crap first."

ITS NOT WORTH THE TIME OR MONEY. even with discount. Combat becomes a pain at times cause of your basic special attack make you jump and use it in some flashy way which leaves you open to attacks from other enemys, guarding attacks will still hurt you and parry seems to be automati. There is no other combos other then what you have in your moves list. Climbing and travel movement from wall run to jump often leads you falling to death as its not a very well done correction system for when your wanting it to jump to the right but insteads jumps as its confused of the direction your inputing and if your using a gamepad that means something. There is no way to upgrate your basic attack or get new weapons other then 4 so called dics mods that need 1 energy bar to use. I love tron series but this game does it no justice. Stick to tron 2.0."

By challenging I mean like running from buildings falling apart,  avoiding/ trumping the impact of explosion,  managing your health while in the middle of fighting a mob of sentry programs, etc it's very challenging.  The story in this game takes place before the Legacy of Tron, Pritty much like the TV Series Tron Uprising but, before both Tron Uprising and Tron Legacy.  So yes the story great you wont be dissapointed, the graphics are tramendous, the game play is very enjoyable/ challenging, and the music is so good, I want a soundtrack of it.Theres also a multiplayer in this game however it is not active.  You're not likely to find anyone else in the world to play this with you.

,Not Recommended,315440,19953397,"Posted: 25 December, 2015",all,Artorius Maximus,"First the positive: The game looks pretty and sounds cool, the atmosphere really puts you into the Tron universe.  The story ties in with the new movie with recognizable characters and scenes, although I didn't get far enough into the game to really give a valid opinion on the story itself.  As a big fan of the Tron fanchise, I was growing somewhat skeptical of where the story was headed before I quit playing.Now the negative:  The game is an obvious console port.  It's definitely more difficult to play with a mouse and keyboard, there is a distinct advantage to using a controller.  This in itself is not a problem, but it detracts from the experience a little for me to think about how this is a game about living inside a computer that wasn't actually originally designed to run on one.  The gameplay itself is visually appealing and basically alternates between levels of psychedelic parkor and flashy combat, with the occasional crazy vehicle level thrown in.  None of the gameplay is particularly difficult or challenging however and it becomes a little rote after awhile - except for when it becomes ridiculously hard in random spots but for the wrong reasons.  A spot of particularly bad level design that led me to get frustrated and put this game down was a 'disc station' you visit for upgrades placed right next to a cliff.  You have to perform a jump combo off this cliff to get to the other side by first pressing A to jump, but you also press A to access the disc station.  The end result is I repeatedly ran up to the cliff edge, accessed the disc station instead of jumping, then fell off the edge.Other thoughts:  If you're looking for a good Tron game, play Tron 2.0 instead.  It's older than this game and pre-dates the new movie but is a MUCH better game than Tron: Evolution.  I think Tron 2.0 had more thought put into an original and engaging story because it wasn't just capitalizing off the success of a new film, and the gameplay was both more challenging and rewarding.  Sure, it's not as pretty as this game, but is still an attractive game and still looks way better than the original Tron movie!"

Maybe not, but if you have a coupon or it's on sale sure why not.I have 8 hours into the game. I've completed the story mode with almost all the Tron Files and 4 out of the 6 Abraxas Shards just by collecting during normal gameplay (didn't take any time to go hunting for anything). About an hour and half of that was spent trying out the multiplayer arena which, if you've been playing through the story mode is like turning the game down to super easy.Story: 6/10 Entertaining but playabilty-wise is basically just: Fight handful of bad guys with one disc, run and jump on a few things, fight another handful of guys with a different disc. Repeat repeat repeat until the end of the game. The challenge level never really goes up in either the parkour or fighting aspects of the game and after about an hour of gameplay you've learned every move you're going to use for the rest of the game. Zero re-playability.Multiplayer: 4/10 Again, entertaining but not really any kind of challenge if you've been playing through the story. The bad guys in story are much harder than the groups of people in the gaming grid and that's not saying much. I never invested anything into grid upgrades at all and yet it's like the grid is on easy-mode. It's basically: Run up on a group of people standing around trying to melee each other (for some reason) throw bomb disc and de-res 4 people, charge up and repeat repeat repeat until you've won the round. The capture the flag came is a little more entertaining but still not much of a challenge.I found the game to be entertaining for an afternoon/evening which is all it took to almost completely explore and complete the entire game.

While it doesn't do anything different in the genre and takes cues from the modern Prince of Persia and God of War games, it's a lot of fun running around and beating up the enemies and bosses. After beating the game once and doing a speed run of the game leveled up, you get an awesome feeling knowing that you're more powerful than ever.While the inclusion of Game for Windows - LIVE and the SecuRom DRM is a bummer and is a pain to get running at first, the game is fun enough that I feel it's worth the trouble of getting it to run and enhancing the game (such as accessing hidden resolutions and changing the color of your character). The multiplayer looks fun, but no one really plays the game online anymore.Overall, I would recommend the game. Just know that getting the game to work can take a little bit of tweaking, but it's worth it."

Google it.  It's a life skill.  That said, if you already own an Xbox, or use any MS services, or own Win 8.x, then you probably have a MS account, which you can use with GFWL without creating anything new.  It's simple.  Once you get that out of the way....The actual game is decent... good, but not great.  There's some oddball resolution choices (720p if using a TV is max you're getting through the game menus without attempting tweaks, which I did not)... but that's not a huge debbie downer to me, since most ""last gen"" console games only rendered at 720p (sometimes less!) anyway.  The visuals are good... a decent rendering of ""the Grid"", but nothing extremely flashy... it's appropriately sterile looking.  The CG cutscenes are just okay, with not enough budget thrown at them for the characters to look very realistic.  You do get Bruce Boxleitner, Olivia Wilde and even The Dude's actual voices.  The game's story ties into and basically serves as a prequel to Tron Legacy.  Gameplay is similar to recent Prince of Persia titles but lacks that level of polish.  It's not bad, though.  Music is very good, cribbing some of the Daft Punk tracks from the film, as well as some original tunes (some of which are lame, but several are updated versions of music from the original 80's film!  Awesome.)  Vehicle controls are wonky but usable, and checkpoints are mercifully frequent so that if something (i.e., the controls or a surprise hole opening up in front of you) kills you, you can get back to where you were very quickly.  Blowing stuff up in a light tank is difficult to control fun.  If you're a Tron fan and don't mind (or like) PoP mechanics, then this game is more fun that it really deserves to be.Score:Graphics: 3/5Sound: 4/5Gameplay: 3/5Overall: 3/5Recommended, if you're a PoP or Tron fan, otherwise skip it."

I would love to recommend this game to any Tron fans. But there's one reason why I can't. I just can't.It's the controls.The controls are some of the most horrendous, hideous and insidious controls I've ever encountered. Never before have I had a game where the controls are actually actively working against me.First of all, battle. You basically have to aim the character at an enemy and hope he throws the disc at the enemy and not somewhere else. Bad enough, but it can be worked out.However, in the platforming passages, some stuff is virtually impossible. When you want to make a vault off a rail, you have to hit that rail perfectly. However, with a camera that never knows wether it should react to mouse movement by a slight shift or by a huge swing, that's hard. Then there's the wall-running. I've seen some well controlled wall-running and jumping, like in PoP 2008. However, here it's virtually impossible. The character seems to jump on and off the wall at random, more often than not it doesn't react to the buttons pressed, and at times even jumps off when NO button is pressed.My conclusion: the character is actually a suicidal ISO that only does as it's told when it feels like it. Most of the time it doesn't feel like it and prefers jumping into the void to be derezzed.Now, that wouldn't be THAT bad, if I could just continue where I left off. Like, quicksaving before a difficult passage. But NO! The game starts me at some checkpoint earlier. And it doesn't save the progress. It actually forces me through all the tutorial messages AGAIN, all the while I can't move or do anything. But I can't just close the messages, can I? No, I have to actually WAIT for the game to courteously allow me to close the messages when it sees fit!Why the hell does the game actively prevent me from playing? How often, in the few minutes I've played, have I screamed mentally ""just let me PLAY!""...Way to ruin a potentially good game."

These parkour segments (which make up like 80% of the game) were the most infuriating.The combat segments were ok/medioce. The vehicle segments were meh.The only thing this game has going for it is the story/aesthetics (assuming you're a fan of TRON look and lore), in which case I might suggest just watching a letsplay.Regarding GFWL, uninstalling and reinstalling in particular order worked for me, perthis guide.

It probably won't work the first time you run the game, I highly recommend checking out the troubleshooting threads. (I got it to work by changing my computer's locale to English, but that solution might not work for other people.)The story serves as a prequel for Tron: Legacy, helping set up the events of the movie and giving you new insight into the plot of the series. Gameplay-wise, Tron: Evolution is decent. It's not the best game I've ever played, but it's not the worst either. It's a third person action game that has a high emphasis on combat and parkour. I personally found the controls to be a bit awkward, but I was using a keyboard and mouse. I recommend playing with a controller if you have one.Bottom line, this is a decent movie tie-in game that I can easily recommend to fans of the Tron series. However if you're not a fan, I don't think you'll get a lot out of this game because it doesn't really innovate or bring anything new to the table that you haven't seen before in other games. If you're a Tron fan and want to learn about and experience The Grid for yourself, consider giving this game a try. If you're not a fan, maybe don't bother. Or go watch the movies first."
