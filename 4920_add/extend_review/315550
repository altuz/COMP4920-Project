,Not Recommended,315550,11823544,"Posted: 22 August, 2014",all,Soros.SL,"Typical indie game, this time it's about driving the taxi.- game is a bit bugged, but nothing that can kill the mood. Be careful with hired drivers though, they have a tendency of being dumb when you spectate them- only one view, but camera is doing an okay job to show you the road. Traffic lights are shown not only as usual, but as lines on the road too, which is helpful. Speed limit is shown all the time, it's 30 or 40, depends on the street- no Steam Achievements, no trading cards. Yes, it has few in-game achievements, but when do Steam users care about them?- 3 different cars per each of three regions (makes 9 cars at the end), first one is unlocked, others are unlockable by collecting 5 of their parts- not too many opportunities for an actual management - hire driver, buy him a car, upgrade it a bit, tell him to go out and start picking passengers, spectate him, drive for him. That's pretty much it. Oh, and upgrades aren't enchancing the perfomance of car, but decreasing it's maintenance- money can be earned easily if you know what to do (you can fill 8-slot cab depot in 10 minutes by only completing emergency client pickups) and can be spent even easier on cab upgrades, which will in overall cost you ten times more than your car, trust me- physics.... It's an arcade! What would you expect?At the end i can tell you one thing:Look at the gameplay videos. Ask yourself, do you think it will be boring for you if you will be driving around like this for couple of hours? No? Not boring? Well, that means you are like me, who likes driving games. Spend some money, spend couple of hours, maybe couple of evenings, then forget about this game. Boring? Go find yourself somethins else, this is just an indie game about driving taxi, not some Crazy Taxi"

,Not Recommended,315550,11850150,"Posted: 24 August, 2014",all,Zaggeh,"Good concept, bad gameThe concept behind this game is rather appealing to me, but the execution is poor.  There are two major game-breaking bugs that require reloading your last good save or restarting entirely. (Pick-up/drop-off points not loading properly, getting stuck on the map screen with AI taxi drivers) In addition, the concept of having a team of drivers and managing your taxi company is great, but you'll find that once you get a couple drivers, you'll be making money so stupidly fast that the game quickly turns from a fun interactive taxi simulation game to an idle game where you just watch your numbers grow.  It only takes a couple hours to completely max out.Overall, I'd say skip this and wait for a better game within the same genre.  I'd pay $40-$60 for a GOOD taxi simulation game simular to Euro Truck SImulator, but this is certainly not it, and not even worth half the price of what its listed for."

The concept is goo, I like the tree/grass and the water is very good. However, I just have a couple of pointers that need tweaking, and one major update that is needed, in my opinion.If you select England, for some reason the money earned is in $'s not £'s. Not a biggie really. But in the UK we don't follow km/h, but we do follow mph, like USA. That would be nice to update.But the big update that is needed is on the nighttime. During the day, loads of cars all over, and no problem following a marked car. Hit night time, no cars at all, including the marked car. So I was stuck on the mission. Tried a couple of times, and it still didn't show any cars.Apart from that, its a relaxing game, but there are so many traffic lights I feel I'm driving in London but in a tighter version.I'll recommend getting it, as its a cheap price, just needs to night time update!!Have a Playlist here, if anyone wants to see the game etc :)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cfRn1BxTGI&list=PLYeelEYrtoAJNwI1J6kAqBxg9AeJbAN5AKro"

The taxi actually freezes before you go backwards or forwards when you turn around.Don't take my word for it, and check out my video by clicking on the link.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4lPQKqZ3s0&list=PLGCO4EfbVB6XXoAnQMUJjoEh3c2BLfHx8&index=53"

As well both give game-breaking graphical glitches on my particular video card.That aside, I only could play it for about five minutes before deciding to change the game resolution, and now I cannot play it again.  On any graphics setting.  Even changing the resolution back didn't work.If you are experiencing this, you will notice how you are staring into nothing but a blue hell that stares back at you.In the five minutes I've experienced in this death trap, the taxis inside of the taxi depot appear to develop self-propelled hover technology, or maybe just a graphics problem with the tire models.Unfortunately you cannot run over any helpless citizens (the best part of any taxi game) trapped in the three cities you must plunder through.In other words I could have used this $1.29 to gamble with CS GO cases, so I highly recommend this to people with gambling problems."

Controls are fine too, I don't have any problems with that. But, there is one thing: the frame rate is a little bit low, even if I put to lowest graphics, and I don't know why. I have a pretty good PC, so I think this game should run nicely. But even like this, the game is fun, you can drive around and pick up passengers, you can drive New York yellow taxi, the classic black British taxi, and I really am happy for the German taxi included too! No DLC, no in-app purchases, so that is good too. So I say, you should buy this game if you are searching for a light, simple to use, but still challenging, and fun game! I am happy with this game.

Its ok, i liked this, also, its a big + the game have 3 starting place, you can even play with London taxi! There is peoples on street, and the jump off the way if you try to get closer with the car, they running on the crosswalk if the lights is green for the car , it was a nice thing to see. Also, the time is changing in the game, and day night cycles there, even raining. Its also nice. I don't care the graphics too, im not a gamer who says graphics is the first in games, but i have a geforce 950m now. But...The game...Oh...First of all, there is no other cars with headlights, its ok, not important, but the workers that we can hire, i mean the drivers. Leave the road, go off to the houses, stop on the road centre and never start again. I was forced to go into depo, and control them from there(yes you can control any driver's car) to help on the passanger that was helpless waving with his hand for 3 hours long because waiting my driver who went to drink a coffee or something, and felt its important to stuck into the tree :S Other time just forgot to stop, and crashed into me with full speed. Id say even this is...ok?... But...As someone wrote in review, there is missions, when i need to follow a car. Thats ok, i had the warning don't start at nighttime, or there is no car that you can follow. But no one said there is a chance even if i do this mission on day time, to delete all the cars and after you will never have any ai cars again in the game. Also there was times when i fell off from the game and went into the neverending nowhere when i wanted to pick up bonus package. If you pick 5, you will have a new car...nope...you only have the car in shop to buy for lot of money. After these bugs i had almost no chance to make any progress, and because i really wanted to see something is must be fun in this game...i said...ok...ok...i will do it...But noo, the game had 2 big surprise. First, this is the first time i had lag in the game, and had the whole game lagtoo...What?When the game lags (on geforce 950m really?) the car uncontrolled, and leave the road or crash into anything that is before it. BUT in this game the pedestrians, the hired drivers, and even the ai drivers lags, lose controls, and even if you manage to don't crash when comes the FREEZE time, one of the cars will crash into you because lost control, and leave the programmed way. The biggest surprise, you will have a luck game with saving. You save the game, but sometimes the game says lo, you wont save, and even if you see the game saved, after you turn on the game again next time, want to play, you see there is no games to load{LINK REMOVED}up...What?!How the hell can make someone a game without realizing the game have bad program code, that stops the player to save the game!? This was the minute, when i said, no more taxi! Only recommended to masochist persons.+ 3 places to start with+ Can drive London taxi+ day night cycle- Only our car have headlights- no horn- game lags on even new cards- lags the whole world and makes your taxi damage- Ai taxi drivers stuck into anything- Fell off from game world if you want to collect bonuses- gameplay bugs that makes the game unplayable- Saves is lottery, maybe works, maybe not- Lot of more things i can't count them0/10 I don't want to ever thinking on i played with this game"
