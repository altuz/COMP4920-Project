You'll rarely need brakes, there's no damage affecting performance, wall-riding and AI-shepherding is a thing, etc etc. Think NFS Hot Pursuit 2 as a budget title. Once you're over that, the game is quite fun, with a variety of unique gameplay modes and challenges, and a ton of unlockables to keep you coming back for a while.Best control option: Gamepad."
,Recommended,315600,15882734,"Posted: 18 May, 2015",all,BlazeHedgehog,"This is a surprisingly decent racing game, as long as you're okay with it feeling a little dated.What it lacks in realism or modern visual fidelity it makes up for with a level of variety that harkens back to the days of Bizarre Creations racing games like Project Gotham and Blur.They just don't make games like this anymore. Racing games take themselves so seriously, now. So does Ford Racing 3, but you also get to race in a variety of exotic locales that sometimes borderline on being cartoon-ish caricatures. Golden Buddha statues and giant Tiki mask tunnels await you. These are not boring circuit or street races (but those are available, too.)There's also a ton of different event types that move beyond just racing and time trials. Again, it's a lot like Project Gotham in that respect: drive through cones, collect points tokens, practice your drafting abilities and way, way more. There's a lot to do in this game, and a lot of cars to do it with. Trucks, coupes, sport and muscle cars, even concept cars and Model-Ts.Just don't expect Forza. Don't even expect Need for Speed, really. But if you're in the mood for a racing game, this will serve you well enough. It's just not a revolution."

Its simple, you win or lose, be faster or push the opponents into the walls, may be too simple, but don't get me wrong, with all these flaws I still like the game, because I relax then playing, I enjoy the beautiful tracks, not just a simple racing track, but a forest, a snowy mountain, I just love it, get it on sale, then its worth it.5/10"

I remember how angry i got when the save data on the ps2 got corrupted. This has aged and the graphics show that but this is your classic old school arcade racer. Its like a low budget nfs game but it plays out pretty well and in the end it gives me that same awesome feeling that i did when i was like 7-8 years old. Crazy how things change in a decade. its worth a shot espeically for a single pound, £1 is a steal. The tracks are simple but are in interesting settings and there is a clear difference between them. granted ive not got a lot of time in it yet its its still doing well.

76561198037528719,Recommended,315600,12061858,"Posted: 11 September, 2014",all,Tuppence007,"This is a fairly average arcade racing game from the PS2 era. The physics aren't great and the graphics have dated (you will need to manually alter the screen resolution from the game's folder in order to stop it stretching things from 4:3 to 16:9), but this game has a few tricks up its sleeve.It has a wide variety of unique game modes and is one of few PC games that supports split-screen multiplayer. The car selection is also great, with a mix of rare classics and unique concepts from Ford's history. Some of these cars (like the Ford GT70 Concept) are literally in no other video games, so if you're a fan of Ford this will definitely get your inner car-nerd excited.Admittedly the performance of these vehicles is not accurate. They're split into classes which supposedly feature similar vehicles, and the vehicles within these are balanced to be competitive with each other. But in the Off-Road class you get a mix of pickup trucks and rally cars, including the formidable Ford RS200 from Group B rallying and the original Ford F-Series from 1948. In reality, these vehicles wouldn't even be close to the same league, but here they can both bring the fight to each other.But the game does have a really nice race and unlocks structure which I really haven't seen enough of in recent games. And at the low price of £4, there's really no reason to not get it if you like these cars."

,Recommended,315600,12087679,"Posted: 13 September, 2014",all,Riggert,"As a successor of the famous Ford Racing 2, Ford Racing 3 adds a few more racing modes and a lot of more cars, yet the fun stays the same.Released in 2004, Ford Racing 3 still keeps the same amount of fun in 2016 compared to back when I first got to play it.The number of cars, compared to recent racing games, seemingly is little -- but remember that this game contains some cars you will find in Ford Racing 3only!The variety of racing tracks goes from idyllic over original to unrealistic, but still fun. One can choose between different locations, and then can choose between the racing tracks, original or reverse.The soundtracks... well, you can disable them and turn on your own music with e.g. Spotify (or whatever you prefer). They surely are not the best on the world, but for 2004 they surely were considered 'good' or 'okay'.The number of racing modes is considerably high -- but there are not any special modes such as Drag or Drift. Just driving, maybe with Boost, maybe with obstacles.Considering that the game is already more than 10 years old, which is obvious for those graphics, I think it is still worth buying it, if you are a Ford-Fan and/or like racing arcardes!Furthermore it is a great reminder of the times you may have spent with playing Ford Racing 2 from a CD you got from a cereal. :)tl;dr: Old game, worth the money because of cars only available in this game."

It was difficult at first because I hadn't developed strong driving skills in video games. Despite that, I still enjoyed the game, though I didn't finish the game completely because I couldn't do some of the harder races. Fast forward into today, when I became a better driver, such as playing Gran Turismo, Need for Speed, and Test Drive Unlimited 2 and getting my driver's licence, I still enjoy this game, and only got it for 99 cents. Sure, the game is 10 years old, but one of the best classic games I ever experienced.Overall: If you're a Ford fan, then this game should be fun. There are plenty of cars to race from and from different classes, such as the Model T, Mustangs, F-series trucks, and the supercar Ford GT. There are also a large number of tracks with different terrain and layouts. The game also offers a campain mode as well as a challenge mode.Rating: 9 out of 10.Though it is fun with plentiful of cars, most of the game is really easy (despite the ""hard"" difficulty) and the crash physics are a bit unrealistic. The graphics are alright, but it's to be expected from an old game."

Meh sound, good for 99p.I had Ford Racing 2 around the time it came out, and remembered it being quite fun at the time. I thought I'd buy this to pass the time whilst Theif downloads. At 280mb, FR3 only took a few minutes. This is basically an arcade racer before Arcade Racers became showy, boombastic, DUB filled, EA-Sign-In-Please Racers, and it is all the better for it. Essentially you just race races to unlock cars, and do special challenge races to unlock other cars.At its core, the racing physics are pretty good for an Arcade Racer; there is a good balance between grip and powersliding fun, and the cars go far faster than in real life, All in all the driving works well and is the reason why it kept me entertained as well as it did. It supports the 360 controller in that you can bind the triggers to acellerate and brake.The graphics are probably equivalent to late Xbox, early 360 graphics, and almost look cartoony. At the end of the day they get the job done well enough, and support all resolutions that Windows allows, but only supports 4:3 so at 16:9 the game looks stretched. Have a look athttp://forums.overclockers.co.uk/showpost.php?p=27281114&postcount=1243for some better screenshots than the steam page.The sound is passable.Overal, I was going to spend the 99p on a coffee at work on Monday, so, did I get more enjoyment than I would from a coffee?

,Recommended,315600,19728470,"Posted: 16 December, 2015",all,kschang77,"FR3 is an arcade racing game with some famous Ford vehicles on variety of closed tracks, with variations and time of day to make the tracks look more varied than reality. There are the typical racing modes, regular race, elimination, but a few special modes like boost where you have to time the use of nitro boost carefully to pass. The graphics are pretty low but then, this game is old, and the frame rate is good. The cars do skid somewhat but in a rather arcadish manner, with no tuning possible.There are two sets of missions. First is the Ford Cups. You start with fairly classic cars, classic Mustang, Mustang II, 46 Ford, Ford Galaxie, etc. As you win the cup, you unlock additional cars, additional cups, and additional liveries for the cars. The idea is to win all events and be declared the ultimate Ford Racing Champion. Obviously the later events gets really tricky, as cars get faster and harder to control. And there are many classes of vehicles, from offroaders to trucks, from coupes to moderns, from sedans to super-sport (like the GT and Mustang GT). Once you collected enough vehicles, you can do the vehicle specific challenges, which are even harder.The race types are somewhat inventive, as they go beyond the typical race.Regular Race: race 3 laps and who's the winner at the end?Elimination: race 3 laps, last two places eliminated per lap until last lap as it's down to sudden deathDuel: race ONE other car on first lap, 2 on second lap, and 3 on third lap. Beat them all.Driving skill: race through the gates (don't hit them) to buy more time and finish the lap before time runs outOvertake: overtake X cars before your time runs out (overtake adds time on the clock, hitting them takes time off the clock)Racing line: stay on the racing line to earn boost for overtakeBoost: two boosts for each lap, use them wiselyDrafting: stay behind the other vehicle for X seconds to eliminate them, eliminate the goal amount and you winRelay: Race one lap, draft your buddy to ""pass"", then you race that car for another lap... repeat for third lap.Seconds out: hit the required number of symbols AND finish within time limit to win. Symbols may give or take away time depending on whether you hit green or red symbols.Time Attack: finish lap within time limits. You have 3 attempts.The handling model is definitely arcadish, but not ""on rails"" as you'd expect. You do slide around corners, and skidding is measured (or drifting). Burnout is also measured. Sliding along walls is not recommended, but handbrake slides are possible for tight corners. And obviously all the vehicles will handle somewhat differently (but not THAT differently... Would you believe a .46 Ford can keep up with a '63 Mustang? )  AI cheats somewhat, but not excessively. It will punish you for your mistakes though.  And as races get longer, you will make mistakes. And on harder levels, the times get shorter, the first car gets a boosted takeoff, and so on.The game starts to get frustrating about mid-point, when you realize the AI cheats to stay close to you unless you build up a large lead through truly flawless driving, and that's just on the easy races. And this is obviously not always possible. By the end, when you hit the ""hard"" races, is when you realize that the AI makes impossible turns and you'll NEVER catch up.There is no cockpit view, only bumper, third-person close, and third-person far. I recommend third-person far as you need to see the road ahead .The races do get a bit dreary as each cup is composed of multiple events and it's just using different cars. As you unlock more cars, you can try different cars but again, same courses over and over, so many laps, it gets repetitive, even with all the alternate racing modes. And when you get to the hard races, where AI makes impossible speeds with you having no chance to catch up, is when you feel like throwing out this game.Given its low price point, give it a try, but it's not a deep game, and you should only play it in short stretches unless you get horribly bored. This is basically a 1998 game (similar to NFS High Stakes, with a few extra modes)  The multiplayer ability along with ""design your own race"" (which is really ""remix our races, tracks, and vehicles"") adds some replayability, and it is possible to play this game at high res, but this is an old game, and it's severely out of date. Go play NFS: Most Wanted (the original) for a lot more thrills, IMHO."

Okay, the physics are a strange combination of arcade high-speed turns and little to no braking and sim generally tough-to-make turns, but it's rewarding in its own way when you perfect every single one of that many cars. The models aren't perfect and as highly-detailed as modern racing fans would expect them to be, but they still are impressively similar to the original things - as the game title suggests, Ford fans won't be disappointed. The variety of cars is a strong pro of the game - ranging from 1923 Ford Model T seen so rarely in games to concept models like Indigo - once you dive into the world of the game, you won't feel the urge to leave it too quickly. The sentimental value is superior - FR3 hasn't aged at all. It was fun, is fun, and will be fun, and that's all that matters here. It's not a game that pretends to be the best racer in history. All it aspires to do is to bring joy to players.Also, it costs freaking HALF AN EURO on sale. You WON'T get ANYTHING better in that price. I bought it for the sheer power of childhood memories I have with FR series (FR2 in particular) and I don't and won't regret it."

But you know what I like more than materialistic things? Knowledge. In fact, I’m a lot more proud of these seven new bookshelves that I had to get installed to hold two thousand new books that I bought. It’s like the billionaire Warren Buffett says, “the more you learn, the more you earn.”Now maybe you’ve seen my TEDx talk where I talk about how I read a book a day. You know, I read a book a day not to show off it’s again about the knowledge. In fact, the real reason I keep this Lamborghini here is that it’s a reminder. A reminder that dreams are still possible, because it wasn’t that long ago that I was in a little town across the country sleeping on a couch in a mobile home with only forty seven dollars in my bank account. I didn’t have a college degree, I had no opportunities.But you know what? Something happened that changed my life. I bumped into a mentor. And another mentor. And a few more mentors. I found five mentors. And they showed me what they did to become multimillionaires. Again, it’s not just about money, it’s about the good life; health, wealth, love and happiness. And so I record a little video, it’s actually on my website, you can click here on this video and it’ll take you to my website where I share three things that they taught me. Three things that you can implement today no matter where you are.Now, this isn’t a “get rich quick” scheme. You know, like they say if things sound too good to be true they are too good to be true. I’m not promising you that tomorrow you’re gonna be able to go out and buy a Lamborghini. But what I am telling you is that it can happen faster than you think if you know the proven steps. So, I record a little two minute video on my website. Like I said, now it’s not the most professional I just shot it here with my iPhone, but it’s real. Nobody can argue, this is my true story. And I’m going to give you the three most important things you can do today. So click the link, go there it’s completely free to watch it it’s just a couple minutes. Invest in yourself. Always be curious. Don’t be a cynic. Okay, people see videos like this and they say “Ah that’s not real that’s for somebody else.”Don’t listen, don’t listen. Be an optimist. Like, Conrad Hilton, the man who started Hilton Hotel, he said that he was only fifteen years old when he read a book by Helen Keller, and that book changed his life. Books can change your life. And in that book, Helen Keller said “optimism” so if you’re a cynic, if you’re a pessimist you don’t need to click here. Don’t worry about it, I don’t need to talk to everybody. But if you’re somebody who knows that there’s something better, cause the dream is possible, you know, for some of you watching it’s not necessarily a Lamborghini, maybe it’s a new job, a new opportunity, starting your own company.Maybe it’s a new lifestyle without so much stress, traveling the world, doing those things you know you’re destined to do. You can do those unless you understand finances. Money, I don’t call it money anymore, I call it fuel units. You must have enough fuel units to live out your dream and to live out your destiny. So, I’ll see you on my website, it’s a quick video and you’ll see there absolutely free.So just click this video and you’ll be taken there in a second, and uh, I’m excited to share this amazing stuff. You’ll see, not because of anything of me but because I’ve been fortunate enough to learn from mentors many years ahead of me.

It's perfectly playable - bug free and smooth - but it's mind numbingly dull. The engine noises are pretty dire and the music is so bad it really needs to be disabled completely. Despite many competition 'rounds' there are only a handful of tracks that are just re-used by racing them backwards or with a slightly different route. The night tracks are strange because none of the cars appear to have headlights - consequently it's just dark and feels wrong. 'Bare bones' and 'generic' are how I would describe the experience. Not recommended unless you've played every other race game on steam and curiosity gets the better of you."

I can say I shouldn't have been surprised though by this game's low sale price, but still, I'd expect a higher quality standard from a game released in 2004.The graphics are garbage; the windows are opaque, the reflections non-existant, the detail low with no option to increase graphic quality. The gameplay is awful; the car slips and slides everywhere, there is zero penalty for hitting a wall, and the computer controlled opponents can be spun out by tapping them. The career mode is boring versus where you actually got to do a championship with each car in FR1 to unlock its' black version with enhanced peformance.To sum it up, don't buy this. Either buy a racing game that's worth your time or try the first game."

Not even when you collide with an indestructible hedge.At least it doesn't slow you down when you hit something I suppose.Controls by the way are not very believable. Way too much grip for old muscles - as if esp is turned on at all time, in the 60s.Did I mention the menus? Voice acted, but ripped directly from console. You can't even use the keyboard to type your driver name or use the mouse.And you need hit enter some 10 times after you finished a race before you're back to playingOverall the game isn't worth the 1,24€ asking price.

The  AI  is pretty dumb and, oh yeah,   the graphics  will tell you this game  was released 10 years ago.   This game is amongst  the worst driving/racing game  I've played in a long time.  If you are determined to buy it, I'd advise you to wait till the   sales.  I'm sure all three will  be  on  sale soon?In the Steam sales you can get far superior  Need for Speed titles for the same price you're paying for these games, and Crash Time 2 and 3, which are  on sale frequently   are even less  and are  beautiful games compared to this monstosity.  FlatOut 2 is only  25% more and has so much more going for it, with gorgoeous graphics, fully destructible environments and cars, upgradable  vehicles and  some interesting modes included.One other positive (apart from the music), especially if you are into  retro cars; you can race the very first  Ford car  (Ford Model T)I really don't know why Valve are adding such mediocre games to their library."

If you're not a fan of this then I suggest finding a console version of it.Other than that, Ford Racing 3 is an amazing arcade style racing game. PC port works pretty good as well, nothing too noteably bad. Pretty nice lineup of Ford vehicles from the Model T up to the 2005 Mustang (as well as some concepts). The tracks are pretty simple and actually memorable if you've played the game long enough. The main line of the game having normal difficulty increase and other gamemodes having selectable difficulties that can provide more unlocks. Of course all you unlock is more cars and paint jobs (liveries). Highly recommended if you're a fan of Ford, arcade racers, or both."

The game is a bit Old but hey its fun and gives a very arcade feel to it. For this cheap price i RECOMMEND It so have fun racing Friends! Now in more Detail This game is old for a 2005 game i will say its a VERY GOOD racing game. Now graphics considering its age are good till now still good but not great. This game features MANY ford cars. The physics for its age are good a bit of bumpy feeling but hey still good. I would have liked a damaged car feature but if you can get it in a sale BUY It if you like Arcade feel racing games. Now I recommend many games if you want to see more just check my Profile or Steam group ANime No Gaming My group since im curator has more reviews but check them both if you want. Plus i have gameplay in my Youtube channel and im uploading right now 7/2/2016 which you can check  via AshTheBacon or my steam username in Youtube. Happy Gaming Friends.

First got introduced to this game when it got released on Playstation 2, so it does have some kind of nostalgia factor on me.So what we have here is a classic arcade racing game that surprisingly aged well in my opinion, controls are still playable but don't expect smooth precision even with a controller. Multiple challenges unlocks overtime and doing so unlocks a variety of iconic Fords to drive with, pretty simple. Overall not a lenghty game, but a fun blast from the past.The only thing that I could complain about this game, are the snow race tracks. They are bumpy mess of polygons..."

But other than that the sound track is nice, the controls are pretty good, the cars are interesting, and the gameplay progression is fun due to cars and customization being unlocked through wins. It was definitely worth the $.50 i paid for it and i'd say its worth about $2.50 overall at this point.If you're a fan of racing games or want one to introduce you into the genre, this is a pretty good game for what it is."

Graphics are like PS2 game(because it is a PS2 game :D), fixed on 640x480, and also there is some kind of input lag that is meant to be smoothing of steering to prevent car flying around on little keyboard presses. The whole game is PS2 game with keyboard controls strapped onto it. Mouse does nothing.Allright, enough of bad things. In everything else, this is great racing game. Physics work really fine, and even bots are sometimes likely to try to push you off the road. 8 rogue mustangs out of 10."

,Recommended,315600,31870415,Posted: 20 May,all,Frontzie,"Don't let the hours fool you, I have played 100's of hours of this on the original Xbox back in 2004-2005. For nostalgia's sake, I decided to give this game another go after a ~10 year hiatus. Ford Racing 3, developed by Razorworks published by Strategy First and the late Empire Interactive in 2004, is a racing game released for Xbox, Playstation 2, Windows PC's, Nintendo Game Boy and DS. In all honesty, it's not aged well.Gameplay:I feel like I'm at a poorly invested arcade with old games past their prime - you won't need brakes, there's no damage affecting performance, cars are faster than they should be ('68 Mustang doing 0-125mph in less than 7 seconds). The difficulty of the AI is too easy for my liking while using a controller. Finish your first lap and you're ahead of 2nd place by at least 5 seconds.Graphics:For a 13 year old game, the graphics haven't aged that well. There are no options to change your resolution (you're almost always playing in 640x480), the only options in ""Display"" are for whether you prefer MPH or KPH, or whether to turn the minimap on or off. The jaggedness of your car and blurriness puts you off within a few minutes.Vehicles:A fair choice of vehicles from 1923 up to 2005, from the '31 Model A to the '99 Puma there's a car for everyone. From concept to rally cars, the hardest part is choosing which car to drive.At £3.99, it's well worth the money. It hasn't aged well, but goddamn I love this game so much, no matter its flaws."
