If you like to download mods, you will have toPAYfor a 1st class ticket to remove the download caps from their proprietaryDownload Station(subscription is $10 for 1 month, $15 for 3 month, or $35 for 1 year).  Bloody Blokes!  And I'm pretty certain the modders are not receiving any of those funds.  If you do not have a 1st class ticket, your number of downloads are limited each month and the download speed isHEAVILYcapped (my speed is around 4.80 KB/sec; that's slower than dial-up speed folks; you'll have babies, watch them graduate from college, and have children of their own before anything downloads via the Trainz content manager).  Both the Trainz Download Station and Content Manager are absolutely horrible in comparison to the Steam Workshop.  I will change my review to a thumbs up if they remove the capped download speeds without paying for a subscription.  Aside from that, this simulator is great and a must have for anyone who loves trains and doesn't care about mods."

I am not going to repeat the hundreds of bad comments people made about the game, but I will say that I agree with almost all of them. At the very least, to avoid wasting your money, wait until the game is fixed and optimizable."
76561198025303183,Not Recommended,315660,15882036,"Posted: 17 May, 2015",all,44TZL,"Conclusion: Loads of features but only glimpses of a game to be seen.For all of you who have not played any Trainz version before, be aware you are buying a pre-BETA train sim engine that is just declared 'release ready'. This must be developer speak for 'most feature we wanted to put in at this time and mostly working'. Don't be fooled, you are not buying a complete game with content. It's more like a game engine + some demo levels in various states of completion.Also, do not buy unless you have a good internet connection.. every new iteration comes in at 8Gb or so and I am expecting a few to come. There's no smart updating.Further, be aware that the Trainz developers are seemingly not interested in any element of normal convention in games. Easy to learn, hard to master... proper feedback (you'll get points added or deducted without explanation).. gentle on mistakes: you will find non of that.Pass a red signal by a hair and after having played for 3 hours... the session will end - a subtle fade to black and that's it. Sorry you should have saved... which deducts points from your session, so you can't get to that 5 star rating. But don't worry there's a DLC coming with proper sessions!!!I found the same attitude in buying a first class ticket. You pay and you will not get an email to say we will activate this in 5 minutes or 10 hours... just give the money and they'll do their best... presumably.For those that know Trainz like myself off and on since TRS2004.. This is no new era... it's same old, same old. You'll know what you're in for, except I think community development has slowed down.On the positive, it looks a bit better and I like the new guidance for sessions and what to do, where to stop, .. but it needs refining. I got completely stuck a couple of times, with no chance of recovery.The best bit I found is the enormously impressive 400 or something miles London - Edinburgh line... which wasn't really done by the dev team anyway. It lacks a bit in sessions and rolling stock through it.. but if the game was finished, had a bit more gentle gameplay and more play-tested content .. it could be a massive showcase. It also basks England in an almost Queensland (Australia) like spring-summer hot weather haze that is just beautiful. It runs very decent on my GTX970 at 2560x1024.The trains also seem to break and accelerate very realistically and it's pretty cool to moderate your speed so you loose the least amount of time being behind a slower train in front. However issues with such as the AWS not always switching off and many niggles throw dirt on this feast. Zoom in map does not work when coming from cabin view, floating repeating houses in scenarios. the cabin and HUD disappearing / restarting... and lots of irritating ALPHA-BETA kind of stuff. A letdown and a really I think just unwise communication of the team to declare the game release ready. The engine may now be getting there, the game is certainly far from being a game.In the end, I think this team is mostly let down by poor setting of expectations (Look at Dirt Rally to see what BETA means!!), lack of content, and a lack of focus on gameplay... with as a result that I think it misses the mark for many. This is disappointing for all of us wanting a great realistic train sim that we can actually ENJOY. The reactions surely will also be a disappointing lack of love for all the effort put in by the devs. Features just don't make a great game. Let's hope we'll see lot's of improvement in polish, gameplay and a dose of realism in the team's communication."

WHY?I purchased, and truly enjoyed, almost all versions of Trainz since day one. I have been a loyal customer and decided to buy Tane after reading developer comments about how much they had improved it. I have a rig that far exceeds recommended requirements yet it runs like absolute crap, graphics pop in even at fairly short distances and it stutters most of the time. And yes, I have made changes in the settings, over and over and the problems persist month after month!IMPORTANT point here -- NO other game or sim that I have runs as poorly as Tane, even games like Flightsim X, released 12 years ago!As most people know, the devs made all kinds of promises while TANE was being develped and they released videos hyping how amazing the then-upcoming graphic improvements would be. Everyone has seen the in-progress (supposedly) videos comparing old and new graphics. Well, it's no secret that what was released was **nothing** like their videos.....and as we all have seen, the hype was flat out misrepresentation.While they did improve graphics, compared to the average game on the market, their graphics look like something that was state of the art in 2004 or so.If you read the seemingly endless posts complaining about poor performance and graphics, you will understand why there have been so many unhappy customers who are angry that what was promised was most certainly NOT what the devs delivered.They should apologize to their customers - the people who keep them in business -- for releasing a badly flawed product while promoting it as a huge improvement to Trainz 12......cuz it's not an improvement by a loooong ways"
76561198011058252,Not Recommended,315660,15855311,"Posted: 16 May, 2015",all,BigVern,"This is one of the poorest versions of Trainz ever released. Despite the much hyped new graphics engine it's necessary to turn off virtually all shadows and water effects to get even a half decent performance (and then it's still sluggish). Without the extra effects it looks no better than its prececessor (TS12) but manages to run worse.Under the hood it's still just the same old Trainz with a few enhancements, such as track which draws points with proper switches and frogs (MSTS had those in 2001) plus superelevation (Railworks-TS20xx had that some years ago). Buy the standard version and you get a route which is virtually unplayable (Hinton) due to lag, a reasonable Aussie route, the behemoth Kings Cross to Edinburgh which despite the scope of the venture came ten years too late and looks state of the art for 2004 (but still runs like a slug on the N3V graphics engine). That leaves Kickstarter County, effectively a small demo layout but compared to the plethora of routes from previous versions is very paltry selection. Word is, N3V didn't want to pay content builders to supply routes or assets and it shows.Although there is supposed to be advance despatcher functions in the pipeline, operations are pretty much as in all previous versions. Except for pre-scripted scenarios which seem to be in the purview of a select few who now how to script them, you just plonk your train down and do glorified free roam. Nothing approximating the MSTS activity editor or RW-TS scenario tools.Don't even think about trying to run this on a laptop. I just had mine perform a thermal shut down while working on a small test route. Okay it's only an I3 but it can run the RW-TS editor (or MSTS) for an extended period and nothing like that has ever happened - heck even TS12 didn't nearly set it on fire.A disappointing end to what promised to be a genuine breath of fresh air on the train sim scene. The Dovetail TS20xx has nothing to worry about from this competition unless N3V can set to over the next few months, get some new coding talent in and turn this poorly optimised mess into something resembling what they promised and for which many KS backers (not me, I was a bit more savvy and saw this coming) many AUS$1000's. If the Dovies can push on and release their UE4 sim in a couple of years, Trainz will be dead and buried."

It's worse than in previous part of the game. And something tells me two month aren't enough to fix it. It's TOTALLY the same game as Trainz Simulator 12! Now i think that 2006 looks better! New engine? Where? There is no any NEW ERA.  But there are: big troubles with the optimization, endless time of loading of session or appearing of launch window, shocking texture quality and a lot of bugs. I didn't see anything in common with the trailer video on Kickstrater. Nothing! Oh, I'm sorry. It's true, all objects have a shadow now. If to be honest I was very disapointed. It looks like they sell us the old game second time. It's all about beta. But it's only two month before release. I don't belive in miracles. Think twice before buy."
76561198175264058,Recommended,315660,19477916,"Posted: 4 December, 2015",all,longridgejim,"This is a quick review after only using TANE for a couple of days.My main interest is in building my own layouts and operating trains under a free roam environment.I purchased TS2015 approx 1 year ago - and though impressed, it didn't seem suitable for free roam.I reloaded TS2015 again a month or so ago - and tried again. On forums I saw some suggestion as to how one could switch from one train to another - it was cumbersome and didn't work. I asked directly on the TS2015 forum and no-one could give me an answer.WIth TS2015 - I could only swap ""free roam"" locos if they were close to each other - and if I did select a second loco, the the first one simply stopped moving.Went on a TANE forum and asked the same question. Had a same-day answer - that the functionality I wanted was available and easy to use.Was a little doubtful if it really would work.Have also seen concerns about frame rate etc with TANE, but decided to give it a go.Have run through the tutorials - and I'm fine with frame rate and general presentation. I have an NVIDIA 570GTX graphics card - which was deemed good 4 years ago - but if I upgrade, I'm sure I could get better performance now.The critical issue for me is the ability to develop the equivalent of a large train set,  that I create,  and where I can drive different locos  at the same time, where I want to, and at the speed I choose for each loco.As indicated it's early days for me - there are numerous tools to learn (as indeed with TS2015 ) but that can come in the weeks ahead.The key test was yesterday. Without any study of the manual or on-line help etc, I went into surveyor mode - and created 3 separate tracks - one roughly oval with one set of points leading to a side track and the other two were just single curved lines of track.I put locos and on each track.I started one loco - at slow speed, selected another from a simple menu - and started that at a quicker speed.I started a 3rd loco at another speed and moved it in and out of the siding from the oval track.It all worked - 3 locos running at different speeds that I can control.From a simple menu I can jump to different parts of my layout - to wherever my locos are present- and I can get control of any one of them without impacting on the other locos which continue to move around at whatever speed I've set for them. Effectively 3 locos in ""free roam"" that I can control easily and independently.As indicated above, there is an incredible amount to learn - both TANE and TS2015 are impressive, but the ""free roam"" functionality is what I wanted. Rather than simply drive up and down long albeit impressive routes created by others, the magic for me comes from creating my own railway.TANE offers this to me.I was fortunate to purchase this game on cyber-Monday for £15.It's worth a lot more.Over the years I've pondered whether to invest in a model train set. Locos here might be around £100 each. A spend of around £1000 or more might give  me a good layout with a few locos, track, buildings and scenery etc but would seem very restricted to what I can get with a computer program. There is infinite potential if I want to explore it.The base cost for TANE and TS2015 (now TS2016) is very small - I'd encourage anyone to buy both and see what aspects appeal.As I said above - for me, the ""free roam""  capability is critical. As I understand it, TS2015/6 claim that most users don't want ""free roam"". That surprises me - but the bottom line is that I do.HENCE I will be staying with TANE and spending a lot of time on it in the months (and years?) ahead.I'm happy that TANE can offer what I want - and I'll now invest the time with manual and any other source of learning that I can find.Subject to anyone checking their computer spec and their graphics card in particular, I'd recommend it to anyone who is interested in trains."

They promised a new era yet everything still looks the same and frankly the performance is just as bad, even on a decent machine can't play one of the routes without turning everything off or to  low (Hinton division something).   Textures pop in and out and objects appear and disappear at random.Routes and assets still look bad nothing appears to be updated there, and ouch at the loading times.   I understand the appeal the game to some but sorry I can't get past the dated graphics and engine that has badly needed an update year after year but unfortunately did not get enough attention this time around and just like prior years a sub-par product was released again.This may be Trainz New Era but they certainly did not mean the current era.  4/10 and I hate that because I was hoping for something better."

I can't find a way out of DCC mode that most of the scenarios are in. At this point at least, Goat Simulator is a MUCH more entertaining and well polished game.

Much seems recycled back from Trainz2004, 2008 and 2012. I only see Trainz2012 under a new skin and asking for another 37€, which is outragous if I may add, if a game that didn't even finish its goal in about 2 years and has been tested by the public for 1 whole year, it should be 10-15€, not 37€! I could just as well get TS2015 and maybe Cologne-Dusseldorf with the ICE 3 aswell and have more fun and having actual  amazing graphics which is promised for less of a price than T:ANE which uses recycled models back from 2004. Pictures don't match, where you see shadow in the picture, it doesn't exist in the game. See amazing graphics? Doesn't exist. See awesome routes? Only available in the Deluxe edition so give them 70€! If you're really a hardcore fan of Trainz, go ahead, buy the game, I won't stop you, but if you're looking for a fun but at the same time serious train simulator, go and get TS2015."

,Not Recommended,315660,30758815,Posted: 26 March,all,Dr. Strangelove,"SummaryA lot of wasted potential, but if it's available on sale (I bought it for -75%), it's definitely worth it. Don't even bother to purchase it at full price. It won't be as good as Train Simulator or Train Sim World, but has several strong elements that can make it interesting. Nevertheless I cannot fully recommend it - I will still play it, but would definitely never buy it for the standard price and I will not buy any DLCs as those seem overpriced too. As the week long deal ends in less than 24 hours and the review will be here after that, I don't want anyone to get a wrong impression about this game's price-to-quality ratio which is really poor. For more details, read the full review of what works and what doesn't below:Note that I only have it for a couple of days and I have no optimization problems. I don't know how it's been in the past but it seems all right now.What works1. A lot of different goods and great ability to customize what you're carrying. You can easily set up a route where you can take whatever you want - coal (and A LOT OF different variations of it), cattle, general goods, fruit, vegetables, fertilizers, cement, cars, almost anything you want, and you can even customize how much to take. There are also industries that produce goods or need them which is a very nice touch.2. Making routes and different sessions is insanely easy and offers a lot of customization.3. Routes available for the base price are really nice - you get Australian route from the 1910s - I don't recally any TS route from this period which is a shame, a 1950s American one which is great too, and probably the best one - 1970s British route that covers the ENTIRE route from London to Edinburgh - almost 400 miles. I don't think there's any route for TS that even compares to that. Those tend to be a lot too short unfortunately.4. There are a lot of great routes and assets available online and there is no problem with dependencies - download center checks what you'll need and downloads it. But at the same time, don't expect top notch quality - many of them are pretty dated. What I liked the most are old routes that Train Simulator lacks - England, France and Silesia from the 1930s and 1940s wartime Germany.5. Performance is really good and there are three performance presets that you can change on the fly to find what works best for you. It worked pretty well for me.6. Free Internal Camera - it feels almost as if you're walking around the train like in Train Sim World.What doesn't work1. First class tickets. You will need one to download community made routes (otherwise downloading is capped at 10 kb/s, and most of the time around 9 kb/s) and it costs as much as $7.49 for 30 days or $26.99 for the whole year now. FOR SHAME!2. Graphics are way worse than TS ones and way way worse than Train Sim World. Even no moving passengers waiting for you at the station. Just static figures. Kinda breaks the immersion for me.3. There are very few DLCs and those are worse than TS ones.4. TS has a much better GUI.5. It lacks quick drive feature of TS - you can't just set time, season, and weather and drive enjoying AI traffic and in the world that feels alive. You have to either set everything manually or download a session, and those are really hard to find. AI schedule for the London-Edinburgh route I downloaded failed to show up in the game's menu.6. One that was already mentioned a few times - asking price. Train Simulator 2017 is cheaper and at the same time much better than TANE. I'm sorry but this is the main reason why I cannot recommend this game. It's price-to-value ratio is poor to put it midly and DLCs are no different.7. Steam train physics and handling are worse than TS's.And the last thing - does it feel like a new era?It's been a while since I played Trainz - Train Simulator and now, the Train Sim World, are so much better. After a few years, I don't feel like that's really different from the old Trainz. Sure, some things are better, but overall, it feels pretty much the same. It's quite stale and feels moving nowhere, and all that for a pretty hefty price. Train Simulator does it better and there's no real reason to change, except for a good discount. For about -75% it will be fun, otherwise it's a definite no-go."

I don't know where to start with how cr*p this is, it feels like you're playing with a train set with an onboard camera rather than driving a real train, the train control is just wrong.  They seem to be very proud of their graphics but imho Train Simulator is way better & at least in that title the cab interiors are reasonably HD & realistic, these are just pants. I have a new system with 32GB ram & a GTX980 card & I still need to dial down the quality to well below that of Train Simulator to get a reasonable frame rate. Maybe I've missed something (the menus are weird & take you into multiple windows, they seem proud of this too for some reason??) but playing scenarios seems like an afterthought as well, I couldn't find anymore than 4 & after getting a UK passenger one started it just felt so wrong as a driving experience I gave up. Hopefully work will continue & in a year or so they will have something to be rightfully proud of, at the moment though it is just a Toy Trainz-Set simulator so I'll go back to their competition."

There is no posibility of it becoming like it was in the trailer.And do you want to know whats the most bull****iest? EVERY ROUTE NEEDS TO BE PAID FOR.

Have seen a lot of changes (for the better) during the beta time to retail release. Some of these are the  amount of bugs and other quirkiness that have been fixed. eg. the database hanging and not finishing the repair, numerous random crashes, graphic glitches etc.Settings should be set realisticly for the pc that is used.  As with any game, each one is different and what one game will run on low/normal/high/ultra does not mean the other  will as well as no game is identical. The sim will make the pc work, but a lot depends how much content is in a map, the pc's hardware, good air flow and how well maintained the computer is and of course the users expectations.The surveyor is where Trainz really shines if you are an established  route builder or just starting out.  This is where I spend most of my time.  My work in progress route that has been moved from Trainz12 to T:ANE now blows me away as to how good it looks (in my eyes anyway).  Even just by altering the time of day and then watching the shadows move as time goes by is wonderful.  The reflections of trees on the loco and carriages as it passes by is very eye catching. Oh and there is sway with carriages and loco - very cool.Pros:  Excellent surveyor (editor) tools which make creating your route vey easy.Can be manually optimised for using hdr, bloom, depth of field and other goodies whichcan make a route look very realistic.Compatible with majority of content from previous trainz versions.Thousands of free content on the download station,  A First class ticket will enable faster downloading and norestriction on amount of downloads.Shadows are great.  Can see object shapes on the ground, reflections of clouds/vegetation in the water, etc.Has backward compatibility with previous trainz content.Devs are working on patches and seem to be very passionate about the sim and sorting things out.More goodies to come in the future - weather elements (thunder lightning) is just one of them.Cons.

Or B they at least update the cab model they use for it to look in place but they are still using the same cab model from Trainz 2004 or possibly older its hard to tell but by no means is it good looking so for now unless they do alot to impress me i still dont reccomend this game to anyone
,Recommended,315660,27584706,"Posted: 25 November, 2016",all,Tomix,"First off, let me say this. You WILL NEED A POWERFUL COMPUTER TO RUN THIS. If you're running on a toaster laptop, don't buy this and write a review saying it sucks because it's a lag fest. That is your fault for not doing RESEARCH to learn what hardware is good for a game. Some people even say that the game runs terrible with a top quality machine, so caution is advised before purchasing the game.As my account would suggest, I am quite the train fan. So much as that I've been playing Trainz since I was a kid, all the way back in 2003 and 2004. I have also purchased most of the major releases up until Trainz: A new Era aswell. However, before you start screaming that I'm a ""Trainz fanboy,"" let me mention that I have in fact left the simulator for a while went to the competitor, Train Simulator aka Railworks. I stayed with the simulator for a while because of the improved graphics and physics but returned due to the horrid process of content creation. I heard about A New Era before and watched it while it was in development. I passed on the Kickstarter and decided to give it a go during the 2015 Christmas sale.For those of you who are new to Trainz, let me explain the basics of this simulator. The main features of Trainz are Driver and Surveyor. In Driver, you can drive trains and in surveyor, you can create routes, sessions among other things. The game also features a content manager that allows you to manage your content downloaded from the developer's server called the Download Station, or from third party websites through .cdp files.I for one have never played any of the sessions before, so I honestly cannot say how accurate the Train AI is. I personally just hop in with my models and screw around for a bit and close the game down. If you want to read about sessions, look at a different review.Those of you who know about Trainz and are wondering if this is a good purchase, let's find out.What does Trainz A New Era have that previous versions of Trainz do not have?The main difference right off the bat are the graphics. TANE has real-time shadows that help to lift the look of the simulator, with a bunch of post processing effects to help make it stand out from it's older brothers. These shadows look fantastic (mostly), but they come at a great cost, performance. Currently, I am using a GTX 690 with an i5-2500, and I am barely able to get 30 fps with all settings maxed out except for shadows. These shadows require ALOT of power, almost too much power in fact. If you want this game to run smoothly, do your research to get the best possible combination so the game will run great. Oh, and if you want 60 fps, make sure to set V-Sync to off in the Launcher to enable that. Otherwise, the ""half"" setting will cap the fps to 30.The post processing effects range from SSAO to HDR Tonemapping and give you lots of options to play around with. Personally, I can max out the post processing effects to Ultra and have no major performance issues. The effects look nice, but nothing compared to big AAA games such as The Witcher 3, GTA V, Fallout 4, etc.One feature that I must add is quite fantastic is the ability to add trains while in Driver. This is a feature you wouldn't think is that helpful, but it's a feature that you depend on.What about third party content Tomix?Well, this is where it is a mixed bag. Some content may work, while others may require lots of TLC to get running again. This is especially gruesome with content from a previous version of Trainz. You may be there for hours or days fixing content until everything works! Not optimal, but this is not necessarily the simulators fault. Many errors are the user's fault for not fixing in previous versions of the game. Don't understand what I mean? Let me explain.In Trainz, your content can either have an ERROR or a WARNING. ERRORs will not let the content work in a game, while WARNINGs will let the game run the content. Some WARNINGS that were once fine in previous versions turn into ERRORS in a later version. This is the case with lots of faulty content in TANE.Remember Content Creator Plus? Yeah, that's gone. As a content creator, this by far is one of the weakest spots of the simulator. Content creator plus saved many hours of painstakingly fixing syntax errors in notepad and had many of the tags you need to make content. How do you do this with TANE? ALL IN NOTEPAD AND THE WIKI. Seriously N3V, why did you remove this? This feature NEEDS to return, otherwise people like myself will have to run back to older versions to make content and then port to TANE.On the bright side, the new Content manager is quite nice. It's confusing at first, but there is a viewer that allows you to view the model as it would appear in the game, without even starting the game up! It is all around easier to see how the model will work in-game, and as a model maker, I adore this feature.At the time of this review, Service Pack 1 Hotfix 3 is the latest update. One can assume that more patches will come and make the simulator better and better. I honestly want this simulator to survive and be successful. Unfortunately, N3V need to follow through with more of the stuff that they promised.Moral of the story, it's the same old Trainz you're used to but with more extra frosting on it. It's your choice whether or not you think it's a good idea. I'd say wait for it to go on sale, or buy it from a third party website.Keep in mind, there is a bunch of features or bugs that need to be worked on. This is NOT a master piece, but then again, there seems to be no Train Simulator that has everything we all want. This simulator meets my needs, but it may not need yours.If any of you have further questions or want to make a comment on what I said, comment below."

Since that time, N3V have been promising a decent patch in Hotfix 2 and from my perspective they have delivered-- the sim plays without stuttering, slideshow, or CTD'ing on my curently mid-range machine (geforce 760, 16G ram, I7).  Graphics look somewhat better since lighting and shadows don't seem to cause the same problems they did before although they are  still far from what was shown on kickstarter (again more likely because my machine is not top-end).I'm not all about graphics as I run a railway simulator called Run 8 and love it-- the graphics are okay but not the main feature of that simulation-- I am more of an operations simmer so if ops/activities function without causing distress and I can lose myself in that for a few hours then the sim is worthwhile.  In Hotfixed 2 T:ANE I can run activities, such as loading and unloading coal without a slideshow happening which is pleasing and bodes well for more ingame hours.I will recommend this because N3V is still fixing it and it is running way better than at launch.  I will add though that YMMV (your mileage may vary) with results better or worse than mine."

If so, this is the game for you. With controls which are easy to learn, and an actual driving mode that simulates how a model train is operated, anyone can quickly master this game. Heck, I built my first route, albeit a bit unrealistic, at the age of 11 back in good old Trainz 2006! If something like Dovetail's sim seems too much, this is a perfect choice. If you are looking for hardcore realisim, however, I would stay away from this one. This is more of a model railroad sim than an actual train sim, but prototypical operations are possible as well.Also, if you are worried about content, there is trainloads *hehe* of third party content on the DLS and other websites.

If this is a new era, I'm glad I wasn't around for the old one.Considering what is on screen at any given moment, the game is poorly optimized. Even after the service pack, which boasts big improvements, it plays at 30 FPS with a 980Ti. The track and ballast doesn't even sit down on the terrain in many places creating a shadow under the track that makes it look really phoney. There was only 1 route included that interested me, and zero locomotives that interested me. I also found out that the areas that were as beautiful and nicely detailed as the promo shots were few and far between. Most of the map I eventually played looked like an unfinished layout at a model train show in rural Kansas. The interface is subpar, the camera controls are horrible, the physics are unrealistic, and both versions of the train controls gave no sense of actually driving a real train. If I had been introduced to this game with no prior knowledge and was told it was aimed at small children, I would have advised the developers to step it up a notch. (No pun intended)My visit to the Trainz Portal and the acquisition of some of the highly touted ""free"" community content was also as pleasurable as a trip to the dentist. Navigation from the game to the portal is clumsy and the portal itself is even clumsier. After the fairly laborious process of actually finding something I wanted to download, I began to wait for the data transfer at a whopping 5K. Yes, 5K. 1/3 of the speed of a dial-up modem from 20 years ago. I waited an hour and a half for a locomotive to download, only to find that key files were outdated, corrupt, incompatible, or removed by the user who uploaded them, and the locomotive would not work in-game. This happened several times in an attempt to assemble a small train to play around with. All told, I had blown 11 hours before really getting into the game. Those 11 hours were also logged as playtime because the game was open, so when I asked for a refund, Steam refused. Seriously, if you're going to offer me a handy from Evangeline Lilly, but in order to get it I have to get pounded in the tush by three ex-cons...I guess I'll have to pass.This industry has really gotten out of hand.

However, when you disable shadows, the game performs extremely well, although sometimes the cab view cuts in and out, which is rather disconcerting. Still, the overall performance of the game and general gameplay have improved massively on the previous version.Overall, I still don't like this game as much as Train Simulator 2015, which for me has better graphics and performance, and also more user-friendly controls. But whereas the problems with Version 1.1 made it unplayable, the improvements made to Version 1.2 mean that it is definitely worth trying out.Bear in mind that the game is still in beta mode, but with the full version due to be released in about the middle of this month, that's another good reason to buy it now and then get the update to the full game."

No lags at all. And it switches views quickly, including coming in and out of the map. The physics engine (how the trains react) just feels better too.There are new navigation aids that keep you from being surprised by a station stop when you don't know the route very well. And with the sliders in the default positions the scenery is much better than the previous version and gone seems to be those funny looking wiggling trees. However, now and again when moving the view around with the mouse I'll get a few trees and such popping up out of nowhere, but again not as much, or as bad, as with T-12.You could easily go broke buying DLC for this sim but there's more than enough right out of the box to keep you busy. And although I haven't tried it much the route builder (Surveyor) works better according to what I've read.One thing that's gone from the previous T-12 (at least for me) is when looking ahead there's a point (like a horizontal line) where the track's wooden ties are rendered but passed that line they aren't. And I found that really annoying. But that's gone now in TANE.One thing about sims like this is you have to be really into the subject matter to get the most out of it. I can't tell you how much time and money I've put into flight simming over the last 30 years or so and I know I'll never get that deep with TANE, or any train sim, but it has that kind of depth if you go that route.I would have liked to see a way to “free move” around the engine cabs like you can in most flight sims, and I think I've heard of a mod for that but haven't taken the time to look into it. However, I've read in the TANE manual there's a way to customize the various view points so that's somewhat of a  improvement.The passengers on the platforms are still the same lifeless souls (that could have certainly used some improvement.) And while some down-board say there's no new sounds I'm pretty sure I've heard a few new engine and track noises right off the bat.IMHO, If you put a lot of time into Trainz-12 even with all the lags and flaws you deserve to get TANE!"

They were good games but not optimized, glitchy and overall just a pain from just running it to 3rd party content installation. Ts12 had amazing content (thanks to Jointed Rail) but a very old engine so it was even more of a mess. Now with T:ANE I thought my dreams would come true and the engine would be reworked so it would look and play like a modern gen game. Wrong. T:ANE is just as bad as 12, dosent even look that great and its just a huge let down. I though id be taken back to the glory days of 2006 with all that amazing content and pretty decent preformace but now its just too much. I think Trainz is going to die soon, its sad but true, its on its way out. Dovetails games ( previosuly RSC ) Railworks - Train Simulator 20 (whatever one there on now) runs better than this, and even that game has it fair share of issues. Enoughs enough. I used to love MSTS and Trainz and despise Railworks due to its lack of 3rd party content and poor preformace but now Trainz has fallen a rung under, and Railworks had risen above by slowly improving the game engine and providing decent products (albiet high prices). As far as the best sims now?Open Rails. A reboot of MSTS/Micorsoft Train Simulator that has everything that T ANE promises with the silkly smooth frame rate (I can average around 200 FPS) and taking advantage of the biggest library of virtual train content that was created for MSTS. FREE with a pre installed MSTS. Yes thats right, free. What are you waiting for?http://openrails.org/Train Simulator/Railworks. Graphicly the Most stunning train sim on the market with pretty decent realism and decent (depending on the route) preformance. Addons are expensive but most are very impressive and are worth it. However it still has bugs and no 3rd party content support.http://www.railsimulator.com/The entire Trainz series from the 1st tilte to Trainz Railroad Simulator 2010. Can't go wrong with these versions of Trainz. Might not have the graphics and realism that some sims have but has the best route editor of any Train Sim, pretty large content selection and its certianly a unique experince.Liked the Trainz Jointed Rail content but hated how it preformed bc of Trainz? Jointed Rail is producing a new sim that runs on the Unreal 4 engine. Amazing stuff, check it out.http://crosstiestudios.com/"

Dont be like dovetail with their $3000 worth of DLCs. The main thing i love about trainz is the content, the community and the modesty yet very fun to play so my verdict 8/10 there are still room for improvement. one more thing, the old content manager is better."

Trainz has DLC of course, but they aren't all required to run any user created content that's available.I pre-ordered TANE on Simulator Central (about 3 years ago) and since I was having issues with over-seas transactions, decided to convert to Steam so I can continue to purchase any DLC.This game is worth it.

I probably have had more enjoyment with this version of Trainz than I have had with previous versions, partly because I am semi-retired now and have had  more time with it. I have seen steady improvement in the sim from the early betas through HotFix 1 and 2 (beta) and expect it will continue to get better.That's not to say that the game has been without its problems. Along the way I have upgraded my video card to an NVidia 750. which made a big difference in frame rates and the level of detail I can use. Shadows remain problematic. On some routes, I can use them; on others shadows really bog down performance.Finding T:ANE compatible content can be a problem. I spent a lot of time floundering about on the Download Station until I discovered the freeware routes uploaded by Bob, msgsapper. His routes and sessions all work well in T:ANE and are all available on the Download Station.Since I don't have the ability to create my own routes or rolling stock, I'm looking forward to more T:ANE payware and freeware that take advantage of T:ANE's advanced graphics.Overall, if you love trains and have the time and patience to work through T:ANE's quirk, I think the average user can have a lot of fun."

With my previous version of Train I had the default content, plus about 20 custome routes and about 10,000 extra DLC items I had downloaded using a first class ticket a while back.  I enjoy making my own routes, and so I had a lot of scenery items from which to play with.  Yeah, back then all that extra content sure loaded down the start up of the game.  But I understood it, as there was a lot of content.  Loading up this new version, I thought for sure there would be a lot of content to play with.  Sadly, however, the pickings seemed very slim once I did get in and see what I had available to me.  So imagine if I imported all my old content, it would probably take 3 hours to load :)So I load up the sessions, and notice that now you have to pay to access some sessions.   $39.99?   Really are they fooling anyone by deducting that one cent?   $40 for a single play session?  WTF.   I would say about half of the sessions that come with the stock routes, you now have to pay extra for.  Here is a question...   If I published a route, could I set a price for sessions too?  And will I get that money as the route publisher?  I somehow doubt it, but damn...  That would be nice.Anyhow, I loaded up the editor.  I have spent most of my time in the editor, so I can usually throw together something fairly quick.  And alas, nothing has really changed that I noticed throwing together a quick route to test some trains on, in the editor.  I saw that they has a FEC GP9 locomotive.  Oh sweet....   I love GP9's   I have been waiting for an official highly detailed GP9 model.   So I plopped that down on the track.   The outside skin was indeed very sweet.  So I ran the session, and went to drive the GP9 around...I get into the cab view of the GP9 and...  I can't believe what I am seeing.   No detail at all.  This looks like the stock SD40 interior from 2004.  Nothing has changed!   Seriously?    Very unhappy about this.Luckily I have been working on a physical real world model railroad, in order to get my train fix as of late.  If I had to rely on Trainz much longer, I imagine I would develop a real bad taste for train simulations."

Ok - phew -loading not fast - but not worth complaining about. Ok... hmm major chugging.. ut oh - the reviews were right?!? Darn - I was hoping not... wait - hmm.. a little tinkering - AH - ok - cranked up graphics to full, lowered the rendering distance to its lowest I'm happy! AND I NOW KNOW that this game will still look awesome with my current PC and perhaps the next two game machines I buy! Yeah I think they gave us more than we are usually even expected to be able to use. So let's quickly complain that we have more software than our hardware can handle... with the safe guard that you can tweak it and make it run just fine.Have I seen any sluggish bits? Yup. The menu System seems to chug the game - yeah - a little - but - I don't mind - it's usually pretty smooth... depends on the views - definitely is directly proportionate to your current view's number of polygons (models, trees, trains etc) ... but yeah the menu seems to do that regardless of view - but its not all the time and not bad ... really - for what I'm seeing so far - I couldn't care less.People say the lighting system isn't all that, it was professed to be awesome and it's not different than TrainZ 2012 or whatever - um - I think it looks great. I'm a developer and 3D guy too - and I think people want the darn holodeck for crying out loud...so do I but I don't expect that for forty bucks :D So....Lighting? Looks great to me.Graphics? look great to me!Game Play: So far so goodAbility to do simulator or treat this as a model railroad? Yup! Does that. (But I don't think it does electricity circuits and remote control engines...like really simulating making an actual model train layout but then I haven't played this long enough to say that but I haven't seen any hints that might lead in that direction yet either. Rule The Rail - Old - DirectX9 thing does that and is awesome! 3600+ free user addons too haha - Side note! ) But yeah this looks awesome! My Rule the Rail game doesn't nor is it intended to compete with these graphics.I think this game has an open platofrm, you can complain about DLC or just give them a message: Buy if you think its worth it, don't if you do not...simple!) There will be tons of community stuff coming, and there is probably tons already.I think this game looks great! I have Train Sim 2015, its great - but I like the brighter colors and the basic direct x 9'eske brighter look - (I even love the marvel comic look of Rule the Rail but - fact is - if you like it then yay! I love it! I think it looks great.)Now so far I did find one thing in this program that is 100% stupid that my (still!) favorite railroad game to date ""Rule The Rail"" does perfectly - even over a decade ago! When the Turn Table turns... THE RAILS FREAKING DISCONNECT from the railroad ties and the turntable mechanism UNTIL the turn table turns enough to be say the amount for a rachet (wrench) click - then the rails snap into correct position... as the turntable keeps turning those rails stay stuck...until that same amount of turn ( a notch?) is reached then the rails snap into position there... I found that laughable HOWEVER....While I was laughing at the screwy turntable.... I sat under a tree that was hovering about 12 feet over the tracks in a certain bend on a hillside... whie contemplating these few things that seem out of place I figured:They don't know what the heck they are talking about! This game looks freaking great! I mean really - making this stuff run is harder than standing in front of a camera with makeup acting like you someone your not - yeah - making code like this purr is hard than making a movie! [in my subjective opinion... your results may vary] haha  - As a developer I know what goes into this and see this much work as the symphony it does - whatever quirks remain - darn - how about picking out the worst ones and see about getting them fixed in the next patch.I admit at first before I started tinkering with the graphics settings and stuff - I thought I had a lemon. When I saw how well the graphics looked with the stuff turned up and the viewdistance turned way down - looks awesome - and I kbnow if I want to go even smoother I can turn other things down.Already just using this game for a few hours I've seen more cool viewpoints, vistas, more working hardware on a train (swining chains, the hardware on the steam engine wheels looks awesome) the trucks on the rolling stock, the engine trucks on diesals - I really don't think you are getting ripped off getting this program.  I am convinved it will run for years perfect if Microsoft doesn't continually make their operating systems slower and continually drop support for stuff we all bought into just for them to take it away.... but again I digress.If you get this and hate it...and you read this review - sorry - I really think its awesome and for heaven's sake - some high-five the dam developers and the money handler who managed to get this thing out the door!

Not quite.The ""almost great"" aspects:  serious train-buff attention to details of engines, cab controls, realistic railroad rules and signalling, grades, mass, inertia, acceleration etc.  Decent sized map to start with.  Excellent tutorial introduction.  Terrific sounds -- very convincing and immersive.  Reasonably challenging gameplay once you get into it.  I could definitely enjoy this game for many hours... BUT...The ""not quite"" aspects:  graphics are pretty crude/simple by modern standards.  In a gaming world where Dear Esther and Euro Truck Simulator are widely popular (and not super expensive), it's kind of hard to go back to old-school low-res, cartoonish landscapes and objects, bright sun shadows even when it's supposed to be overcast, rain falling inside railroad tunnels, engines that break down into weird isolated shapes if you zoom in too close.  Nevertheless, given the sim's other charms, this ""retro"" graphical quality could be forgiven.  What can't be forgiven is extreme instability -- on OSX anyway.  I have not been able to play this game for more than 10-15 minutes without a hang or crash.  Another issue is inability to recover from an autosaved position;  if you restart after a crash and try to resume a tutorial (some of the tutorials take 10 or more minutes) you can't.  You have to start over from the beginning.  This gets frustrating fast, especially since the game won't run for long enough to complete the tutorial!  Given the lacklustre graphical quality it seems to be very hard on the gpu, too.  I can run ETS2 at Ultra without much jitter, but Trainz (with its primitive graphics) makes my gpu jitter even at medium settings.  Whatever they're doing is expensive and/or inefficient, but without any surface glitz to show for it.If the devs can get TANE to run reliably under OSX it will be worth playing if you like trains, even without improved graphics.  If they can get it stable under OSX *and* improve the cosmetics at least to, say, XPLANE 10 standards, they have an attractive sim even for people who aren't train buffs.  If they can get some pretty scenery packs to emulate real railroads (Canadian Rockies anyone?  California's Coast Starlight run?) then they may have a real winner.  Right now I would have to say mixed-to-negative review from me, mostly because of the extreme instability.  Feels like a beta release."

This game isn't that bad, but the game is priced $40 for four routes, and $80 for eight routes, so it is important to find out whether this game is for you. I reckon that only people that are either train-enthusiasts or simulator lovers like myself would enjoy this game, so stay away otherwise.Certainly, if you are actually buying the game, i recommend you do buy the deluxe edition. It is just not worth it to buy the one with only four routes, as you will have such limited game time.The pricing system for DLC is so strange. It's $35 for a brand new 100km Warwick to Wallangara route. It's $35 for a remake of the TS2010 Avery-Drexel route. It's $35 for Bideye Traction Railroad, a route that is so small, I think it probably took one person less than a day to complete it. Why are they all the same price for different amounts of quality and quantity? It is ludicrous!The locomotives are overpriced. $17 for a regular looking diesel locomotive nearly identical to those available in the base game. $9 for some passenger cars. $9 for some freight cars? Are you kidding? Don't get them.If they really wanted more people to buy the locomotives and stuff, then why couldn't they just utilize the bundle system and make it genuinely affordable to regular people. (i.e. buy 5 locos for $25 or something.)I once again want to stress that the game isn't bad, it is just not for everyone including the average gamer joe."

Here's what I think of T:ANE -1) I looked at some tutorials.  Graphics look pretty basic for what is supposedly a new game on a new engine.  Looks more like Trainz 10/12 to me.  Flat, cardboardy models, no obvious shine, shadows and shading appeared not to exist despite turning them on in the game settings to begin with.2) Interface isn't all that great.3) Tried to open Avery-Drexel route, which I liked a lot back in Trainz 10/12.  Although in the package, I had to download/install it from someplace, WITH THE GAME RUNNING.  Steam's crappy refund policy means this is eating into the 2 hour limit where you can get a refund (I've been caught too often by that before).4) Avery-Drexel inlcudes no driveable scenarios, just the basic route.  Start ""quick drive"" and it dumps you into the scenario editor (I think, anyway) with next to no instruction.  By the time I put together a train and actually drove it, I would likely have run out of the 2 hours play time (see above)5) running the advanced controls tutorial, graphics didn't run smooth, with just one engine moving.  Doesn't bode well for complex scenarios with a lot of scenery.  I never found out how to get a framerate display - I have an external overlay for it but that refused to play with T:ANE.So I've made sure to request a refund, well before the 2 hour limit this time.  Not getting caught again.The price is pretty high for what you get, too - OK, it was a bundle, but not cheap (GBP 55) , and I couldn't see much in the way of scenarios to drive.  Really, N3V?  Is this the best you can do in *how* many years?  Trainz 10 and 12 weren't bad, back in the day, and I found them overall better than the opposition.  But the opposition has moved on, and from the amount I got to see in a the time I wanted to spend, I don't see much evidence of the promised marvels.OK, Dovetail's TSW has some problems, but at least it *looks* like a modern game with realistic looking graphics, not a rework of something from about 2005, and Dovetail appear to be working hard to fix their issues."

I'm pretty much satisfied with the results SP1 has, and i'm ready to transfer my TS12 content onto T:ANE.Except for the fact once I start transferring, I might crash this computer due to the ginormous data files for TS12.I'd reccommend that if you enjoy this game alot, but it feels bare and boring to be stuck with the same content over and over, try out some DLC content that people create online and import into your T:ANE Content Manager. Go to Auran's Download Station or 3rd party sites that offer T:ANE Content.Who knows, you could re-create some amazing routes that exist today, or just play it nice and simple and create a roller coaster that eventually derails the train.. Lol-OLD REVIEW-Overall, T:ANE is a huge step for me since I enjoy TS12 a lot. Here's the things I was unsatisfied when I played the game: Same boring hornsounds! Ok, some sounds good for certain locomotives but it's just the same exact ones from TS12 and below. I had a somewhat higher standards for better horn sounds and whistles. Content being removed every new game! The ATSF GP60B, and C-44 in 12 certainly surprised and awed me. Hoping to find the same in-game content, I could create a good route in T:ANE with these locomotives.. Sadly, not. Here are the Satisfactions: Texture, graphics and better performance. Better routes and certain updated specs. Lastly, we can transfer TS12 content to here since it supports it! I would say the overall review is a +50/-50 but it leans more to the good side about the graphics, routes, textures and so on.Now I'm waiting for those guys who make high quality locomotives, objects, and rolling stocks to start creating some for T:ANE :D"

For now, with my i5-4670K, GTX 760, 8GB ram and SSD I have something like slideshow instead of fluent game on higher settings. Hope that additional 8GB RAM will help a bit.Maps quality - landscapes - they are really beautiful, but if we look on details on map, then it isn't so sweet. Tracks are flying in air, turnouts are too sharp, sometimes distance between parallel tracks is too low, no grass around a track (it would make a bit more realism).Animated junctions - they are okay, but I hope this feature will be supported also in double switches.Trains - there are many vehicles, higher and lower quality, but there isn't command to turn off/turn on an engine (or maybe I'm wrong?).So I can recommend this game, because it already looks better than any Trainz series.

When I had gotten T:ANE, it was in the later state of the Beta builds, when I had gotten it, I find it was pretty well set up, but could use more, or minor tweaks here and there.I forget exactly how I had the money at the point, but at that time I was looking for a good train sim to get for myself, it was a toss up between TS2016 at $30 and T:ANE Deluxe Edition at $70. I'm glad I chose to get T:ANE.I have recently gotten a copy of TS2016, and I honestly feel a touch confused with it, to me it doesn't seem to be as user friendly as T:ANE. Maybe I need to do a bit more digging around on TS2016 to find out how it all works, it's editor is weird to me anyways, it doesn't have the nice tabs along the side of the screen for exactly what you want like T:ANE does, it won't let you place custom consists or make custom consists while in editor like T:ANE does.In my mind the only things TS2016 has going for it is graphics, steam workshop, and the amount of centralized DLC, which costs a fortune. T:ANE may not have a lot of routes, or locomotives, or content in general, but it has one of the biggest things any game can have, user friendliness.I have seen this game rise and fall with the updates to it, I honestly don't understand the hate towards T:ANE. Granted yes, there are a few things they could do to improve the game. I have seen them starting to centralize the DLC a bit more, give to the public what they want, and doing what they can to keep the game series alive.To sum it up in quick points of what I feel T:ANE is:Pros:- User Friendliness- Easy to understand route surveyor- Flexability in what you can do in the game- ""most"" models are pretty outstanding in detail and fleshed out (e.g. the SP SD45)- Staff are helpful- Tons of free stuff (300,000+) on Download Station- A test track to test the limitations of your locomotives and see a readout of performanceCons:- Some models need to be fleshed out a bit more (e.g Payware DLC TUME BN SD40-2)- Not a ton of base content- Needs more centralized DLC, easy to access.Suggestions:- Keep centralizing the DLC for ease of access.- A separate DLC tab on the main screen, rather than going into a route to check it out.- Put a Visit Test Track button on the launch window.- Remove 'Connot Edit' lock on DLC routes, We bought the route, I think we should be able to edit it.DLC Suggestions:- We need a Union Pacific Dash 9 44CW- We need Union Pacific's Moffat Tunnel Subdivision.*hint hint* ;)Overall review 8/10.Thank you for the work and keeping this series alive.-BT"

Was looking forward to TANE, but so many neg comments made me hold off.  Finally I just said, 'f***it, and bought TANE anyway.Maybe they fixed a lot of the performance issues in the May update, because I had pretty decent frame rates even with shadows turned on and tree/texture detail at high.  It gets a little stuttery in heavy rain, but that's the only time.  I do have a high-end gfx card (GTX Titan) so I'm sure that makes a diff.For those (like me) who saw the renders back at the Kickstarter campaign and went, 'wow', yes, you're going to be disappointed.   That was false advertising on Auran's fault and  Auran deserves all the crap that's been thrown their way because of that.  But TANE IS a much richer environment than Trainz 2012.  Lighting is much more realistic, textures better, real-world reflections inside the cab.  And performance, on my machine, is better in TANE than it is with 2012 with the same settings.  also to me the sounds are better, more realistic.  It's a lot of subtle small stuff, but I think it adds up.   The PhysX stuff they keep crowing about is completly lost on me, not seeing it other than it doesn't rain in tunnels?  (Really Auran, that's something you're proud of?)The routes of TANE are pretty amazing.  Much better, more detail than 2012.  Though they're not finished.  Lots of them have missing tracks, buildings laying across the tracks.  It's amazing Auran didn't hire game testers to actually drive the freakin routes before they released it.  Having built games myself, one of the easiest and quickest fixes you can make is to move an asset.  I agree with a lot of posters, that this feels more like a beta.  Still, the driveability of the locos is much better than 2012.  They start and stop more realistically than 2012.I think it's worth the upgrade.  Not at all sorry I jumped in.   I've got 17 hrs in 3 days, and there's still so much more to explore."

If you want full scale gaming experience graphics and arcade fun with action, this is not for you. If you are a rail fan, train lover, railroad modeller (Prototype or not), then it is."

But this company has a history of producing buggy products, and I spent as much time fixing the game as playing it.So when I saw the advertisments for Trains A New Era, I took a chance that the devs had finally gotten their act together, and bought this in January 2015 when it was in pre-release.It was terrible. Every route was broken, it crashed constantly, and it was almost impossible to install updates to broken assets. I waited several months and tried again. It worked slightly better, but was still almost uplayable. i waited till fall of 2015 and tried again. I was able to build several small routes in surveyor, and some of the original routes were useable (but not all). So now I come back in May 2016, the game crashes. Eighteen months after purchase it is still a total mess. And now they are releasing pay DLC, when the main game still doesn't work? Steam shows I have 31 hours on this game. I bet no more than 5 of those were spent actually playing the game. the rest were spent installing, patching, crashing, uninstalling, reinstalling, patching,crashing. Buyer beware."

You can populate your world with interactive industries and task your rail creation to meet their needs.  As engineer, you can yourself perform these tasks, or you may build and set AI Trains to handle the job, or—with multiple trains running simultaneously—you can schedule both AI’s and personal tasking.  And, of course, with AI’s you can sit back and watch all the fun you’ve created in the world you’ve created. You can even become your own director and set cameras along the routes to capture the action from all angles.The more I experience Trainz, the more I see it’s incredible range and potential.  Driving detailed locomotives and rolling stock on working and lovingly created routes in simulation, learning all about railroad life and tasks is only the start. But it’s a great start that has obviously benefitted from it’s 15 years of evolution. When you watch the You Tube fan-based videos and tutorials of previous offerings and compare them with today’s T:ANE (“Trainz: A New Era”—the latest offering in that evolution), you can clearly see the continuous dedication involved.  As the graphics and computer capabilities have improved, Trainz has taken advantage of that by improving the game’s qualities of realism. I find that growth exciting and something to continue looking forward to.But Trainz is about more than a software developer’s product, their ongoing refinements, and your individual creativeness.  Indeed, it’s about a worldwide community of enthusiastic players and knowledgeable hobbyists who are online and only a button-click away. Whether you’re ruling the single-player rails or playing in multiplayer, push that chat-button and you can interact with others from all over who have discovered and are enjoying Trainz.  Also, from the help button, you have immediate access to n3v’s Internet Wiki.  From there you’ll find all kinds of developer-information and can ask questions from other hobby/game enthusiasts who can and do respond with valuable information to help you.  I have personally found the response to be really helpful, timely, and truly there from other train enthusiasts!There is so much to talk about.  If you think you’d like to rule the rails, become a Trainzer and watch a whole new world open up to you.Best Wishes,Froglegs"

Not all of it is great quality. Some assets are quite old and it shows in game. Others do look superb though. Be aware you may have to pay for some of the superb looking content. But compared to Model Railroad terms its not that bad. I can buy an amazingly detailed loco from JointedRail that looks and sounds great for about $10-$15. Actual model locomotives are much more than this and in Trainz i can duplicate as many of them in my route/session for free!- You may be limited on content if not a lot of content creators are painting your scheme, fortunately if you're clever you can reskin things yourself.- Users seem to create most of the content available. This seems to be a double-edged sword. On one had we have tons of content available. Almost anything you'd look for is on the DLS, on the other hand not all of it is the greatest quality.- Dealing with assets which have missing and broken dependencies can be a pain.- Its exremely flexible. You can buid just about anything that you can dream up. The session rules and commands available are vast and can be daunting at first but they do provide ultimate flexibility in designing a session and molding gameplay to whatever suits you. Watch the videos on N3V's twitch/youtube channels they're immense help in getting up to speed.- Visually it looks great. Runs very well on a GTX970. As mentioned some assets and textures are older and some are not the greatest quality so obviously those are not going to look great no matter what.- DLS is extremely slow (8k/s) unless you have a first class ticket which allows you to pay for quicker downloads. I used to have an issue with this but i've accepted it now. Other games charge for DLC and in this unique case they charge for accessing it at a reasonable pace. I just buy a FCT whenever i need to download a lot of stuff like when route building and/or wait for a sale. Its not the end of the world and helps the dev with a little revenue to keep things going.- The ability to create model railroad layouts is excellent. There are some greate community created assets which allow you to build your dream layout.- Some built in assets for such a new game are unusually low quality. It'd be nice to see these updated or removed.- Ability to bulk replace/move assets in route builder is fantastic.- Ability to set up custom pick lists so assets you regularly use are readility available. Also fantastic.- would love to see some abiliy to easily overlay a google map to trace out a real-world line in for building a route. Similarly would be great to automatically shape the terrain based on geographic elevation data.Overall i've been enjoying it and have only scratched the surface with AI trains, route building, session running.

I'm disappointed vastly because it isn't what they claimed it was going to be a year or 2 ago with the videos showing it looking unrealistic in it's quality, it's not bad though but needs optimising still very badly, if I could rate neutral I would for that reason but don't think it deserves a thumbs down, not quite.My system is top end and runs this at 60fps at 1440p but with distance set at 3000, nowhere near the top, shadows are on low, the game looks really nice though and makes TS 2016 look terrible, the only problem at the moment is the workshop makes TS the much better choice as well as the sheer selection available on DTG's offering, a lot of catching up to do, but like many railfans I think both are needed as both have their qualities. The length of the routes is certainly a forte for TANE though, being able to go from London to Scotland in one run has always been great and now even more epic.A lot of work to do here though, i'm not convinced TANE will ever run great like it should, hopefully one day they'll get on top of it.I have changed my mind and edited to suit, the limited supplied scenarios are unforgivable and means that even DTG would offer more as standard for your money, that says it all. Without making a lot of effort this game is very limited, frustratingly so."

Core i5 with a nVidia GTX 760. I usually play games at ultra without much struggle, so I decided to do the same. After I launched the game (which took almost 5 minutes), I got inside the tutorials and the game was lagging like hell, the grafics seemd something from a PS2 game. I googled what was going on and some people recommended turning off shadows (?!) so it would run better. I did it and helped a lot, although the look and feel were still terrible.After the tutorials, got on some tracks and man... the sound ain't nice, the tracks are somewhat confusing... the only thing I liked were the controllers, which I found more interesting than the ones from TS, but the latter beats this game in several aspects. I really didn't think it was anjoyable at all.It's a pitty Steam doesn't have a refund policy, otherwise I'd have asked for one right away.

I held off on buying T:ANE until the most recent winter sale, so they've had time to iron out a couple of bugs. Service Pack 1 is right around the corner as well, so now would be a great time to pick it up while it's on sale.I've always preferred Trainz to the other sims because it has a very robust route and session editor that is extremely user-friendly, which I've found not to be the case with the other sims on the market. Trainz also has a massive 3rd party network.  There is content available for almost every facet of railroading worldwide in some form. The N3V forums are also full of supportive community members who are always willing to help users new and old with any issues that arise.The features that T:ANE adds may be minimal, but IMO they all add to the experience. Improvements in the graphics engine which allow for different texture effects, a proper 3D sound environment, and updated lighting and shading effects all help make the sim world pop a little more.T:ANE does still have some teething issues with optimisation to work out, but that's to be expected. It gets my recommendation, but if you're uncertain, then I would at least wait until it goes on sale (as of the time of this review, you can get the Deluxe version for the normal price of the game)."

I have seen complaints about stuff like that the game does not create the junctions that the trailer showed, but it is actullully possible to create them if you use the track that starts with TANE and it should make them.  The lighting is more impressive then in the trailer when you look on the DLS on My Trainz (Planet Auran) there is not a lot of content but when you look at it in Trainz A New Era Content Manager there are tons of downloadeble content From Trainz 12 but the auther has updated it for Trainz A New Era and the fact that there is pre installed enough content for lite users and there are a lot of good payware content on Simulator Central. All in all I'm saying that this game is better then TS 2016 (2015). Well for those who want to drive a train and nothing more Ts 2016 (2015) is the game for you, but... if you want more then that, like a full Railroad Simulator then Trainz: A New Era is for you and this game is worth the money including the delux version.Final Words:  great good game, buy it."

Would enjoy some new in-game Canadian to-scale routes, especially for areas like Vancouver or Prince Rupert, two very important ports where trains are alway required.  I am thankful for the turn-out frogs, because placing frogs in a yard manually was a true pain-in-the-keester.  However, I have not seen any frogs for X-rail crossings, which can make for a visual distraction.  Would like to see better searchlight signals as well, as in-game signals look a little amateurist.  There are signals available to download (with Trainz12, have not looked for content with T:ANE yet), but would like to see them included with game.

It should be mentioned in the tutorial session where the locomotive used has a default view which is middle of train engine cabin with no proper outside visibility (rather than in the steam engine tutorial, which is where I learnt about [ and ], if I remember correctly).What Could have been better1. Graphics Quality seems to be amiss a bit in some cases (unless there is some setting tweak required/hidden somewhere)1.1. The track about 200m or so in front of the train is not plotted at all.1.2. There were jerks in external view in one of the tutorial. However haven't noticed it in other things which I have tested.1.3. The trees appear to be being viewed from a wire meshed window or so2. Routes2.1. Only 4 routes available by default. I had expected more in the default setup. May be there are a lot of downloadable free routes (have to check after creating a account), but quality of these will have to be cross checked individually and some could be good and some bad.  Would have expected a bit more curated long routes by default.2.2. Each route in turn has only 2 or so engaging scenarios by default. Again would have expected 10 to 20 interesting scenarios/activities per route to keep a new comer to train simulations engaged."

I will be honest.......I havent played Trainz for quite a long time because of all the problems i was getting. However, with Trainz the new era, they definately seem to have made some really good improvements. My one big dissapointment was lack of built in routes and scenarios. You only get 4 routes, only one which is British (ECML). The first Trainz I purchased back in 1875 had loads of built in routes to keep you happy for hours. No doubt as TANE goes along it will gain some really nice British routes.All in all, I have to give TANE a thumbs up. It seems to be going in the right direction."

The new graphics are nice, but what they upgraded in graphics and physics they took away in content.   They took out all of the Union Pacific trains inculding the challenger and no BNSF trains to speak of, I mean the orange Dash 9's.   To make matters worse they do have the other trains that were not included, but you have to buy them and they are pretty expensive.  If you are wanting to get into Train simulation I think TS2012 would be a better choice if you are looking for content.Upon working with the game more and especially after the last update, the game does run better.  Once I got past the shock of not having as many engines to choose from as in the last Trainz I owned, I am going to have to change my rating. I was suprised though that they had a price tag of nearly 40 dollars on the avery drexel route.  Does this mean that there going to have more playable senarios on this map compared with kickstart county's map?  I know these maps take a lot of time to create, but 40 dollars is quite a lot for a new playable route map.  I wouldn't mind paying $10 or maybe even $15, but $40? Other than that if you have been a trainz fan for a long time I think you will get used to this edition, however if you are just starting out in Trainz, I still think that Trainz 2012 is probably the better choice."

To sum it up:-98% of all content full-priced DLC (even if you owned the game BEFORE the DLC was added...)-(I want to point out that while the series has had DLC in previous games, it was never this much or this pricey...)-They were all like: ""ensure there is just enough content included to allow just enough enjoyment that someone might actually purchase more DLC""-Most content is unoptimized (in other words: graphics are rendered extremely inefficently, and often visual glitches and problems exist)-Glitches. We need glitches. LOTS. OF. GLITCHES. (Mostly texture/shadow and sound glitches, but still glitches no less)-Did you like the Download Station in the previous games? Well ♥♥♥♥ you, we don't like you getting free stuff. (While the DS still exists, it has been downgraded to a system no longer user-friendly and is really just a mess.)-This game has multiplayer...I can't figure out many people who would want that.-This game also has Co-op. Again, no clue what that's doing here.-Variety of trains is down to about a handful of steam engines, no electrics, and six or so diesels. So much for making things fit into the surroundings...hope the Mid-West is fine with seeing Union Pacific slapped on everything.-The variety of vans and trucks (freight cars) is mild at best. Good luck moving anything, honestly.-Variety of coaches is even worse. Hope the passengers all enjoy second class cars with identical running numbers.-You get one route in the UK, one in Australia, one US routes, and one or two ""universal"" routes. Everything else is DLC. (This includes a single German route, which is the only free DLC avalible. You get no missions with it; literally just the route and the ability to spawn a train. All missions are spammed as Pay-to-Play content)Overall, a game that promised great potential, but really just derailed the series (pun intended). It is a shame to see that yet another company is taking the DLC route. It's gonna get to the point that years from now, games no longer exist, but rather it's just a bunch of DLC bundled under a single title. (Come to think of it, games are already starting to take that route...)I liked when the series was so open ended, and allowed one to cram their harddrive if they wanted to with all sorts of stuff they'll use in-game maybe once. At least there was no shortage of content, no lack of things to do, and plenty of hours to be melted and burned into making routes. Now I feel like I can't even do THAT. I can't drive trains, I can't build routes the way I'd like to, and variety is nearly none. I'm sorry to say this game is such a disappointment, but sadly this is the case."

Has a few issues but graphics are remarkedly improved, physics are better, multiplayer is much more stable. It just has a more releastic feel about it. Highly recommended if you like trains. Routes are based on rl routes. After almost 12 months I must alter my review. There were some glaring game stopping bugsback then which I highlighted on forums. Apparently the devs dont read or care about the forums because the same bugs are still unfixed several patches and hotfixes later. Now the devs have announced on their website they are making a new game to replace this one. A subscription based game called Trainz Next. Talk about a slap in the teeth for the ppl who paid good money for A new Era believing the hype and crap that was spread by the devs before release. Not even 12 months later they have abandoned the game in favour of a cash grab that is subscription. Unfortunately I have to say if you are thinking of purchasing A New Era, I would higly advise against it. You will be buying a dead game. There are more bugs in this game than an alpha release and the devs have abandoned it. Dont waste your money. Another point I must highlight is the DLC. They will bombard you at every chance to buy the thousands of dollars worth of DLC that is available. Some of it at higher price than the game itself. Dont do it. They have a history of releasing buggy, unfinished, games then patching the DLC, while largely ingoring the core game. Then when sales start to drop they come out with a ""new"" game and the cycle starts again. Run away, don't get scammed, deny them their money and shut them down."

This issue being that signals are buggy to the degree that you are likely to end up  stuck forever waiting in one spot for the signal to change from red, which it never does.Also another issue is that the game is so dismissive if you make just one error. Instead of docking points for mistakes it ends the session and even sometimes is so patronizing as to tell you it is doing so for your own ""safety"" which is infuriating.It's a amazing looking game that runs well and is stable, but it is completely rendered unplayable due to the issues I've mentioned.Also another bad issue, is that they do a dreadful job of explaining how to drive a steam train in the expert mode tutorial. Basically you are left having to guess what has to be done since things are so poorly explained, and good luck with that.If they did eventually fix the issues I have mentioned, then I would very much change my rating to that of recommending the game, since it could be so perfect if it were not for those issues I mentioned that ruin things.I've decided I won't even attempt to play this game again till after SP2.

Trainz is more for those who just want to drive trains and not really get too far into the realism of actually driving a train. Trainz gives you a wide variety of engines and cars to start you off, not many routes or sessions but I generally play the create a session mode and make up my own jobs.The graphics are excellent, edges are a little soft where they could be sharper but my PC handles it just fine. I'd recommend having a half decent graphics card. I run this with an Nvidia 960 on my laptop and there a tad bit of lag, but not enough for me to really care.I haven't delved too deep into modding yet so I cannot speak for that.In summary if you're looking for a model railroading type experience and want to drive a bunch of trains get this! If you want a more real world experience and don't mind sacraficing variety, get Train Simulator.
