For the price you're paying you're getting disc free Japanese Shoot Em Up fun! The developers took lots of care to fix numerous bugs that plagued the original Japanese version. The most notable one was the improvement of how the textures are displayed. There are much much less flickering textures in this version over what I played on the PS2. And also it has some nice options that allow you to rotate your screen and play it as if you are playing on an actual arcade monitor. I know I've only played 30 minutes of this game, but I've already played the PS2 version and know much about this game to let you know it's worth the purchase price. One Gameplay Hint - You need to constantly play this game if you want to be successful and beat the game. I guess if you play often enough, your credit limit increases. Play the game enough and you won't have to worry about running out of continues again. If 2 credits ticks you off, consider giving yourself extra lives and bombs at the beginning to make up for the 2 credits per game. Worth the purchase.

All that's changed is the configuration utility has been translated to English.Very disappointed! Game is stuck in 640x480 so unless you're running this on an Arcade monitor it's going to look like pixelated mess.Not recommended at all and definitely not worth the asking price.

I would recommend changing the keysettings immediately. And to do this you must go to the actual games folder and choose the config tool. I got no idea why they didn't include it in the game. Also, changing the screen to fullscreen in the same tool is highly recommended. This is an incredibly hard and unforgiving game, just like the arcades used to be. I love that sort of challenges, but it's not for everyone. Enjoy :)"

This game has had a long history of being bashed for the dumbest reasons, and now it's getting bashed because the developers weren't interested in working on a years-old PC port that works perfectly fine on newer PCs.The slower ship speed was always the absolute biggest complaint... but it ALWAYS comes from people who worship the older Raidens. The game was always called too easy... which is quite mystifying as it's actually quite hard, and many of the people claiming it's too easy were playing on an easier than standard difficulty. Many of these people also cannot make a dent in the older Raidens which they are directly comparing to, games filled with absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It's really bizarre how people will fetishize those older games like that.The game does have problems. The music is, in fact, kinda bad once you leave Earth. There's a bug with the R missiles that makes them stronger than the M missiles, making other missile types useless. You can't save full game replays, you have to save per-stage replays. Err... that's it? I mean that's really minor. You want a dumb game, go look at Raiden IV with its charge shot ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, with the bizarre nature of OverKill, with the ridiculous amount of totally unnecessary modes, with the online leaderboards being totally worthless, and with the PC port refusing to accept vsync or run at anything less than 63 FPS. Nothing minor about any of that. And yes, I'm saying most of that applies to the original PS3 version."

,Not Recommended,315670,25353490,"Posted: 4 September, 2016",all,Akka,"Dated and genericRather than make bullet paterns that are intricate and complex, this game challenges your twitch-reaction by giving you a ship that moves entirely too slow to dodge anything unless you have the gift of foresight--developed by replaying the game over and over again.Half the time bullets will lock directly onto you so simply sliding slowly in a direction will keep you alive. When you do get killed it's because you didn't expect the enemy who snuck to the bottom of the screen to shoot you from nearly point blank. Really cheap since by the time you percieve the bullet running towards you, your ship is too slow to get out of the way.These shortcomings aside, the song on the very first stage is absolutely amazing.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ3GNGBZ3Z4Almost worth the cost of admission.Almost"

However, as much as I liked the Xbox 360 version of the game, I'm finding it difficult to enjoy the Steam version as I've been unable to get the ""partial controller support"" to work at all!  There is no option for full screen as the Xbox version had.  I hate windowed games.Through trial and error, the controls are:Arrow Keys = directional controls, duh.Z = Main fire weaponX = BombsEnter = Menu, pauseUnder options in game, there is a save/load feature.  I finished playing the first stage very clumsily with the keyboard and tried to access the save feature through the pause menu.  It exited me out of the game!  Checked the options again since Auto Save was on, loaded the last save, no dice...Game started over...  Ugh.  Anyone figure out the key for manual save during a game??  Same deal with manual recording of game play, there's an option for it.  No clue how to use that either.Sad, so sad.  I feel so empty inside.  It's a great game. Cheap when on sale compared to the rare Xbox 360 disc based version.  Bad port to Steam.I do really enjoy the soundtrack though.  So the $2.49 sale price I paid for game+soundtrack was a great re-investment for the music alone.I wish Steam had a neutral option instead of Yes/No for game recommendation.-----------------------------Updated 4-7-17 after useful comment from tenlinkedparts:oh my.

,Recommended,315670,19465697,"Posted: 3 December, 2015",all,Parallax Abstraction,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzOm8NH0j44The Raiden series are always well-regarded shmups but they don't tend to do anything revolutionary. They're well made and good score attack fun but they don't redefine the genre like say, Ikaruga did. Raiden III continues this tradition. Unfortunately, the PC conversion of this game is not particularly good, very strange indeed when you consider that it originally ran on PC-based arcade hardware. It's locked at 640x480 resolution with scalable windowed options available and while it still looks OK, it's dated resolution shows. It also does support controllers but not natively and you'll have to manually do all the bindings in the separate configuration utility. There's no online play or online leaderboards either. That said, this game will run on a potato and plays great with the keyboard so it's perfect for low powered laptops and the like.It's an exact recreation of 2005's original arcade game, including local co-op and with some additional features that originally came in the PS2 version, such as Boss Rush and Score Attack. You also can save replays and some high-level play from what I presume the developers comes pre-loaded.The core Raiden games are good but don't feature as advanced a scoring system as the Raiden Fighters series, nor do they have multiple ships you can select. You get one standard ship with bombs and a few different weapons you can pick up during play. It's not complicated but the simplicity is where the core Raiden games shine. They're good shmups that anyone can pick up and play and get good at with a minimal amount of practice. Even if you're a casual player, there's a lot to like here.Personally, given that this is only one game and a weak conversion, I think it's too expensive at full price but on sale, it's a no brainer. If you're looking to spend $10, I'd recommend Raiden Legacy (which is not on Steam sadly but is on GOG and Green Man Gaming), which is a very well put together collection of several past Raiden titles. Raiden IV Overkill is also apparently a much better (though more expensive) PC version but I have not played it at time of writing."

But I'm just glad it works so well once configured!!If you loved Raiden way back when then prepare to fall in love again...just don't forget to launch ""config"" etc. before trying to play.(This port not having the polish of everything pre-configured isn't great but if you ever loved Raiden it'snoexcusenotto play thisexcellentinstallment of thisclassicseries.)......it's just a shame we don't have a digital edition of Raiden IV...butRaiden IIIis awesome."

Good.This is a simple top-to-bottom scrolling top-view 2-D shooting game with fairly simple graphics that just about any computer should be able to run. It runs well, is free of bugs and with its wonderful settings (all totally unlocked from the start) this game can be as easy or as difficult as you want it to be. It only has 7 stages but it's a nice little desktop game to play in-between times. irritating music but the sound and music can be independently adjusted all the way to mute. It does not keep you from using media player in windows while you play it..."

Numerous difficulty settings make this game fun for everyone and there is also an enjoyable boss rush mode for practicing bosses (or working on a new high score).  This is a port of an older PC version of the game, but that version was never available in English and is not available anywhere else so there is no reason not to get this fully functional and fun Steam version.  The game did not recognize my arcade stick so I have to use Joy2Key for that, but that does not detract from my enjoyment of this game.  I love that the soundtrack comes with it.  One word of warning - the bullets come fast in this one so enjoy honing your reflexes.  Also, even though there are no online leaderboards, there are replays of each stage available in game for you to watch and learn from."

I remember buying Raiden & Raiden II (Raiden Project) on the Playstation, which were perfect Arcade ports, and was eventually able to beat Raiden II.  Never beat the first Raiden, but hopefully someday.I've also had the privilege of playing Raiden Fighters and Raiden Fighters Jet in arcades in Vegas, and both are incredible as well!  The two games in the series I haven't played so far are Raiden Fighters 2 and Raiden IV.  Can't wait to try those as well!So how does Raiden III fair?  AWESOME!  The music is the best I've heard yet in the series, the gameplay is spot on (and hard), and the presentation is the most beautiful I've seen in any of the series I've played!  I was also able to beat Raiden III, but of course it was a challenge!If you are a fan of the Raiden games, or better yet, ""Shoot em' Ups"" in general, then get this game!  Again, Awesome!"

While it isn't as optimized as others here on Steam it is still worth a purchase for die hard shooter fans. The very basic nature of it is a nice distraction for when all you want is just some good old fashion arcade action. It isn't as frustrating as some of the other overhead shooters and it isn't hard to set up the controls with a little patience. Not a bad game for the price if you just want to keep things simple.
