Could there be most explanations and effects for each upgrade I do? please put some undo buttons. The keyboard is dead. I played it like 15 minutes and I am already fed up with it. Please! somebody needs doing some major work here. Zoom-out is impossible and the auto-camera changes made me feel dizzy, why the fuss? Just allow the user the change the camera as they wish.Would I recommend this game, No, not at this stage. 13-08-2014"

If you do decide to try this game after noticing all the negative reviews, get ready to handle a clunky UI with unresponsive controls. 0/10, don't get close to this game even if it's on sale."

The keypad doesn't work, left-click and right-click don't work.... major problems. What is a dancing arrow supposed to mean exactly?There's no in-game help accessible, and no idea how to get to the controls. I had to use Ctrl+Alt+Del to exit. This happened within the first 30 seconds of gameplay.Don't know how good the actual game is since I never got past the skeleton.Don't buy this. Seriously, just don't."

Draw a really ridiculously hard arrow on the screen in order to use this one spell to kill the skeleton.  Quit after 10 minutes of trying.  NO help on the forums, no help in game, and you can't escape the first combat to move on!  You just sit there frusterated.    Graphics are beautiful, but with no option to do anything but scribble on a screen and your mouse movements don't even stay on the screen to help.  NOR is there a ""hey you've been trying this shape for quite a while, new shape?  Or even better, would you like a guide?"""
,Recommended,315680,12567102,"Posted: 19 October, 2014",all,alghero,"Please note this is an early access game and I bought it heavily discounted, neither I've looked at the dev page to see which features will be available in future, so this is just my first impression after finishing the first scenario.- There is no map, no introduction to the story and the basic tutorial gives too few hints- The game so far is really linear, but could improve later. Basically is like an HOMM game where you buy units, explore, collect gold, kill enemies and repeat the cycle. But at the moment there is no loot system, so you always find only gold. Also it seems you are stuck with a certain type of units (3) and can't recruit / find different units, but this could be just at the beginning and heroes could change later in the game.- The camera is fixed, I don't really see the purpose. In certain situations will move in a completely different angle while you are walking making you lose where you were going (add on top of this that there is no map)The good sides:- The spell system is the thing that distinguishes this game from the others. You have to draw the lines on your screen and then select the enemies. Faster you are, stronger is the spell. If you don't remember a spell sign, you can always select it from the spellbook but this will make it less powerful. I did not really notice so much difference, but probably with stronger spells and more balanced game in future this will be more noticeable.- It's really simple and for this price the final edition of the game can fill the void while waiting for your next favourite AAA gameI will play a little more later and update the review and keep looking for updates to see the progress, I'd recommend this game only to people in search of something different and willing to give some trust to developers. But before that, please look at their pages and what they have to say and if you agree or less with them and if they are going to fill the gaps already mentioned in this and other reviews. I don't feel like this is a tablet game, can have his say even on a PC."

Everything else? Well, let's just say that it's not worth the $9.99 full price and that I'm glad I got this off Humble store for SUPER cheap!The graphics look dated, the camera and movement controls are frustrating, the intro is brief, but uninformative; the story is vague and unengaging, the dialogue: atrocious.Actual battle game play seems better suited to tablets and touch devices. Though I had no problem using it, I can see how some people may have had problems drawing spells with speed and accuracy. This game should be made into an iOS and Android app that supports multi-touch.In general, this feels more like an unfinished idea that needs fleshing out and a graphics overhaul. Great Idea, but not engaging enough, not polished enough, and costs too much."

A disaster.Gestures used in magics interface often hangs for no reason, but only in some scenarios. Some are so uncalibrated that in first round without any move of the player a 3 star rating is already impossible.The underlying story outcome is shared by at least 5 movies and 3 games that I know, so nothing new here."

Nice graphics so far, with some better UI could be quite fun.The devs probably have this stuff on there list of todos. These were the most obvious requiments to me.Level menu has no tool tips for what bonus you're unlocking.Needs a veiw army menu also, with info on each unit.Camera follow is a bit annoying. Either have it user controled or stablise the motion.I like the mouse motion to cast spell. But it took me a while to realise it was the faint ball of light to imitate."
