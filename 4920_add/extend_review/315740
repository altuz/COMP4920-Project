There are three environments to  race through;  desert, ice and water.   As with  the other ford games, there's little to like about this game, with handling little improved and  although    the graphics are an improvement on  the 2004 and 2006 releases  (Ford Racing 3 and Ford Street Racing respectively), they are still sub standard to many other racing games released back in 2008 (for example Need for Speed Undercover, which looks amazing and plays brilliantly  even today) that said,  the recently released  Colin  McRae Rally    was released before any of these ford  games and is far superior to all three games and is only a pound  more expensive.My advice, either leave it alone, or, if you are determined to buy it, wait till the sales.  with 50% off,  it'll be less than a cup of coffee.  :)"

Graphics are bad, sound effects are bad (it might be a good idea to turn up the music), car physics are a joke (though it does do simple damage), still the game is fun, and apparently it supports 2 player splitscreen operation.You need to find the PCConfig/Sysconfig application in the ""local files"" to change the graphics settings; be sure to choose a 3:4 resolution or the image will appear distorted.Get this dirt cheap for a laugh, and you won't be disappointed."

The game is obviously old so there will be no suprise that the textures look somewhat simular to that of GUN for the gamecube. I (like most people I have seen) haven't played too much of this yet, however, I am eager to try out that split screen local multiplayer. So few decent games on the pc have local multiplayer... shame."

But, to be honest, this game shows no improvement but a really big downgrade.PROS:1. Variety Of Trucks And SUVS- This game has a lot of todays Ford off road trucks and SUV and even has a few selection of Range Rovers.2. Tracks- A lot of tracks to choose from, but not at the start.3.Career Mode- This mode is about doing events and unlocking tracks, vehicles, and game modes.CONS:1.Graphics- The graphics compare to the other ford games is awful looking.2. Barely any settings-  Audio settings and thats it3.AI is faster than you- I find the AI to be easy sometimes, (Ford Escape is the literally the most OP car in the game) But they will bump you constantly and literally make the damage mode impossible to win.I dont recommend this game, but I do recommend to give it a go. If its on sale for a dollar."

What so ever. Again, its a port from the Ps2 but would still expect the ability to change resolution.The game does not give any intro of controlls or how the game works.The graphics are fine for a game made in 2008, and the game mechanic and feel of the driving is relative smooth.The carrer mode allows for a ton of races and since all seems to take around 2-10min to complete, you schould have hours of entertainment ahead of you, if this is the type of car game you want.When it comes to cars, its obv only Ford cars (Duh)The game dont allow custom cars or upgradeable cars, you can only buy cars thats listed with speed, ac and handling with the money you get from winning.Who would I recomend this game for?Ford lovers I guess, and people who like older car games. Dont expect action though. One hand controlling makes it really boring after a while."

You still can't change graphics, but at least they also removed the option to change the keymapping, and changing from mph to kph in the menu didn't affect the game - nor did turning off the music for that matter."

I will say that map design for the most part was decent but that is kinda pointless if you basicly racing your own best score .Honestly it may be the most boring car game I ever played . I got it on sale and don't even think about buying it full price its not worth it .Note: If you want to change resolution you need to go to local content and find game Config .

I've completed it recently so I've decided to share my impressions.Casual players, people who like console originating-alike games or just like Ford and Land Rover rides will like it. To get the best experience don't forget to tune video settings and controls (community guide avaliable). And the game will look descent then and what's nice it runs smoothly on quite an aged machines. Has good variety of vehicles, so collecting them is a sort of separate pleasure to have. Choosing smart for each race makes it much more interesting. Also there are couple of game modes to choose."

76561198217688739,Recommended,315740,32210627,Posted: 5 June,all,Goldenhawk5219,"It can natively play with an Xbox 360/ Xbox One controller which surprised me! So far, I have not had any problems with this game at all. It plays on Windows 10 64-bit with no issues. It's a typical generic, simple arcade-style racing game that has a progressive campaign system like SEGA RALLY or Rallisport Challenge. You are given credits from the beginning to use towards purchasing a choice of a few unlocked offroad Ford vehicles. You then race and progress through a simple racing career map. You unlock more tracks, credits, vehicles, and events throughout the career mode just like any other simple arcade racing game. You can probably beat the campagn within like 3 to 4 hours. The game is kind of fun as a nastalgic setback from playing from the PS2 or something but that's about it. The controls are pretty decent and you can change what you are using to control the game such as a keyboard, joystick or joypad. HOWEVER, YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE DISPLAY SETTINGS NOR CONTROLS FROM WITHIN THE GAME. You have to go into the game files (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Ford Racing Off Road\PCConfig, then ""SysConfig"") to change the settings. MAKE SURE TO CONFIGURE THE CONTROLS IF YOU ARE USING A CONTROLLER BEFORE YOU PLAY ! The game will probably start with a disproportionate resolution if you are running on a 1080p screen, so be sure to change the resolution from withing the game's files before you play."
