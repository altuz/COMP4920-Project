It should be noted that I'm fairly new to VN games in general, having only played six or seven personally. That being said, compared to those, this blows them out of the water.First off, the story is not only moving and impactful, but long. You don't actuall come across the intro until about 30~ minutes in. That's just a estimate, but it honestly felt the opening came in where other VN closing credits would start rolling.Secondly, the entire VN is voice acted. Voice acted tremendously well, for that matter. Even the main protagonist has not only a voice, but a face as well.Not only that, but the art in this game is amazing. At first I thought I was delusional, but every character's eyes and mouths move. Every character and background scene really immerse you into the story the developer wanted to portray.10/10, only regret regarding this game is the fact that I didn't buy it sooner."
,Recommended,315810,15015789,"Posted: 22 March, 2015",all,Kite,"A short review with no story details.eden* is a wonderful visual novel with brilliant art and a soundtrack that enhances the reading experience without being too overpowering. Simple details like having the characters blink add a nice touch to an already high quality work. This is by far my favorite visual novel currently (this review was created March 22, 2015) on Steam. The $20 price tag is quite steep, so I would wait for it to go on sale (mine was 50% off). If you're looking for a serious visual novel to start reading, I recommend this.Notes:- Length ~15 hours (assuming you listen to the voice acting)- There IS voice acting- There are NO choices/routes in eden* (Kinetic Novel)- There is VERY LITTLE TO NO fan service- This is the regular version of eden. The eden Plus+Mosaic version (not available on Steam) includes added blood to certain scenes and less censoring for certain scenes. It also includes an extra eroge side story that is not part of the main story. In my opinion I would have liked the added blood, but an eroge side story sounds incredibly out of place for this VN.- I consider this a serious/emotional visual novel, unlike a VN such as Sakura Spirit. It tries to BE something and succeeds instead of appealing to absurd fan service.- Originally released September 18, 2009"

,Recommended,315810,16358515,"Posted: 13 June, 2015",all,jfietkau,"If you knew that the world was going to end soon, how would you want to spend your remaining time? What would change for you, how would your priorities shift? Assuming you'd find an opportunity to escape, would you choose a future of perpetual narrow walls and cramped spaces over a short time of ultimate freedom followed by certain doom?For the people living in the world ofeden*, these questions areno longer abstract.MangaGamerdelivers the English release of this 2009 title byminorito Steam.eden*is a kinetic novel (a story without choices or gameplay) about the last few people on adying planet. Its most unique selling point compared to similar titles is its visual presentation: Instead of the waist-up character sprites positioned in front of static backgrounds that we are used to from most modern visual novels, it relies almost entirely on scene-by-scenecustom images,each onecarefully designed to take character positions and camera perspectives into account. This gives the experience a very cinematic feel, quite literally reminiscent of movies, compared to other titles of its kind. Most scenes also features blinking eyes and lip syncing with the Japanese voices, which makes it impressively lively.Needless to say, the asset quality isexcellent throughout, starting with the backgrounds ranging from thepainterlyto theborderline naturalistic. The same attention to detail extends to the characters who, despite the multitude of poses and perspectives, always appear consistent, unique, and alive. From what I can tell as someone who does not speak Japanese, the voices really fit well, and coupled with the competent sound design and the soundtrack by Tenmon (if you happen to enjoy Makoto Shinkai's movies: yes,thatTenmon), which expands a small number of recurring motifs into agripping soundscape, this is an aural experience that you are unlikely to forget.The story revolves around Warrant officerRyou Harunaand his assignment to guard a remote research facility during the planet's final moments. A peculiar (but largely unspecified) astronomical phenomenon is going to wipe out all life on Earth, and humanity is putting the finishing touches on a centennial plan to migrate into space and search for a new home. One component of this plan are the felixes, genetically engineered superhumans whose intellect propels scientific progress far beyond its normal pace. However, there are dissenting voices claiming that humanity should face its ultimate fate head-on instead of trying to escape, so military protection is granted to essential actors within the plan – in particular to Sion, the supreme felix, mastermind behind the giant starships and humanity's savior.The central themes ofeden*include destiny and free will as well as the morality of living one's life for someone else. Ryou, as the self-described ""military's attack dog,"" and Sion, as the people's only hope to keep on living, are both so devoted to their duties that they have fallen out of touch withtheir own humanity. Circumstances force them to confront their deeply buried sense of self and be thrust before themost pivotal decision of their lives: to keep on living in the narrow golden cages of their own design, or to choose the ultimate act of defiance and experience the freedom and joy that they had always denied themselves, living life to the fullest until the curtain falls.The writing tends to focus on character interaction and personal growth over story complexity –eden*is all about the human condition, not about hard sci-fi. In fact, even the scientific details of the end of the world are almost completely glossed over. If you are looking for an apocalyptic sci-fi story with cool technology, this isn't it. Rather, the focus on the characters is so strong that it could be described as downright melodramatic in parts, insofar as that can be a good thing. It features countlessgoosebumps-inducing,memorable,quotablemomentsthat easily smooth over the fact that some of the tension maybe could have been resolved in easier ways, or that there's a certain degree of plot convenience constructing the situations that are most interesting for the characters. It all ends up feeling very complete and satisfying.All in all, I can recommendeden*without much in the way of caveats. If you dislike visual novels or anime-style art, odds are you have not read this far down. If you like visual novels but you're not sure if this one is worth your time, my answer is that it is. I also recommend avoiding playtime estimates. Reading speed varies from person to person anyway, but the later parts of this story work best if you can empathize with the sense of impending dread that the characters are feeling. For them, any day, any moment, could be the last one. It'll be more fun for you if you can get lost in that feeling as well, instead of calculating how many hours you might have left. Even if you have little to no experience with visual novels, this one is probably a better one to get started than most titles currently on Steam. With the above-mentioned reservations in mind,eden*easily gets a positive recommendation from me."

Around the time that I got involved with adult responsibilities a couple year back, I involuntarily stopped sparing time for the genre. Thanks to a friend's insistent screenshot sharing of many beautiful VNs, I noticed that I've been missing pretty artwork and superficial stories in a very girly manner. I gave up and decided to give the genre a go after a long time. My first pick though, being anything but superficial, left me thoughtful and shaken.eden*is a tale of compassion, free will and tomorrow. It is the tale of a world coming to its end. It all started with the appearance of an ominous red star on the sky. After through research, scientists agreed that it is the first warning sign of the end. It took a hundred years for mankind to prepare themselves for a major immigration project to evacuate the planet and search for its destiny elsewhere. During these final moments of the worn planet earth, there are yet things to wonder and chains to break. Between a stoic soldier, a secluded genius, a kind maid, a broken warrior, a regretful commander and a loud journalist;eden*is the tale of breaking chains.The game is designed to be a kinetic novel - which means a visual novel without any choice options. You only keep reading and watching the story as it unfolds. In this manner, it cannot wholly be defined as a game. The quality of CGs and the labor put into artwork are far beyond your casual visual novel though. Characters present a full selection of animations, including moving eyes and lip synch with Japanese voice acting. Voice acting is also beyond the par, as if taken out of an A+ anime series. Translation from Japanese to English is great - which is a rare case in any media - and manages to deepen the mood furthermore. The game is quite long so to say; if you'll be waiting for voice acting you can expect an average game time of 13-15 hours.I'd love to share some character details, but any relevant information about identities or backgrounds would be downright spoilers. Have you ever watchedClannad? With After Story part of course. If your answer is no, it is a huge recommendation. If yes, you already know what kind of soul wrecking experience that you are getting yourself into. You'll remember Sion and Ryou's story for a long while.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

The ride of feelings and emotions you go through as you begin to understand the characters and care for them in your own way. Most other VNs I've gone through barely scratch the surface on emotions... and I can't say many things bring me to tears, but this VN accomplished that. I do hate one thing about it though... that I can't play it for the first time again.Trying to not spoil anything is very hard, as I want to just write all about it in this review, but I will restrain myself, of course. You MUST experience this, it is well worth the $20. It should be worth $40 in my opinion.The soundtrack is wonderful, I find myself listening to some of the tracks back to back just because they are so awesome to listen to. The voice acting is incredible, the voices fit the characters nicely and not to mention, they animated the lips/mouths while they speak, which is rare.Be ready for the roller coaster of emotions... including rage, hate, the want for revenge, happiness, sadness and most of all, the Love that 2 people can share that could overcome anything. Seriously... I can't get anymore detailed without giving some plot away... Do not pass up this story, it would be a shame for you to miss it.Edit: I also don't write reviews on most anything, the fact that I took the time to do so for this VN should say something!"

If you are Haruna Ryou, you take this opportunity so that you can live the last happy life on this dying planet.NOTE: This is a slow paced visual novel. There are only a few jokes here and there to lighten the mood sometimes. Otherwise, this VN can take 10+ hours to read, so if you don't have the patience and you just want to finish a story quickly, this VN probably isn't for you.What type of VN is this?This is a kinetic VN, meaning that you read it as if it were a story book. There are no choices to make so just sit back and enjoy the story (and keep tapping the space bar to move to the next line of text if you don't have Auto forward turned on).Story:To put it short: The world is coming to an end. People are preparing to evacuate from Earth. Creatures know as Felixes have helped humanity with the evacuation, including one particular Felix, Sion.Warrant Officer Ryou is a deadly soldier who struggles to find the reason why he wants to fight and what his goals in life are. He is assigned with a comrade named Lavie by his lieutenant to protect Sion.The story is told in flashbacks. The story begins with the present, with Ryou and Sion living together. Afterwards, we go back in time and see how things came to be.Visuals:There is a reason why Minori's name is on this VN. The scenes are very well done. They are simply, yet beautiful. Character designs are nice. While the building interiors may look generic, there is usually that light streak that helps add some ""life"" to the scenes. Characters will also blink (it's not much, but its at least better than looking at a still , unmoving picture).Sound:Maybe I love the Opening them for eden too much. The soundtrack consists of soft piano music in the background that helps accompany certain scenes. When dramatic scenes start to roll in, you will feel it.The voice acting for this VN is superb. None of the dialogue feels rushed and it feels as if the characters are having a real conversation as they usually would. When things get serious, you will definitely hear it coming.Should you buy it?Like I said before, it's best to enjoy eden if you have the patience for this story.

I may update my review if I ever manage to finish this game or my opinion changes.I still remember the first visual novel I ever played. It had pretty bad graphics with broken anatomy for the character portraits, very few CG’s, 12 different soundtracks of horribly repetitive music, several flaws in its coding which made things confusing at times and not the best English. But the fact stood that a single person with English as a second language had worked and produced an amazing visual story with deep characters that touched the heart.Eden* is the exact opposite. The graphics are beautiful, characters have animated eyes and mouths, there are a huge amount of CG’s, fully animated opening, beautiful soundtracks and sound effects, full voice-acting, perfectly coded and excellent English text. But Eden* with its mind-numbingly dull story and flat characters have succeeded in completely killing my interest for visual novels. Eden* is for some reason passed off as a visual novel but is really a kinetic novel.From the moment I started up Eden* I was bored, but told myself that I was being unfair and should play more before passing judgement. But no matter how much further I went things never turned out interesting and the story only became duller and duller. At certain parts of the story there were moments that could have been interesting but was completely cut out and skipped over because god forbid we have something remotely interesting.The protagonist is Ryou Haruna who is the most perfect boy in the world, the best soldier of them all, dark and totally edgy, has a dark past and charms all the girls simply by existing. He is a terrible person but the story progresses as if he’s a good person with characters magically being in love with him and completely trusting him for no reason.Other characters include Sion who is the most perfect loli in the world, the most intelligent being on the planet despite not being able to wash her own hair and everyone calls her “the messiah”. Elica who is a ditzy maid that takes care of Sion. Lavinia who gets her panties wet over bladed weapons and Inaba who drinks on the clock.I couldn’t for my life care for any of the characters or their backstories and only found them infuriating. Every character’s personality is horribly typical and cookie-cutter. All I needed was an introduction and then I had immediately grasped their entire character and could predict their actions from there on. The conversations between the characters are so flat and unrealistic it feels like everyone is talking to a wall.When I read the description, saw all the good reviews and saw that it was developed by the popular Minori I honestly expected a good story with deep characters. For the first time I wish that Steam issued refunds. The only consolation I have is that I bought it on sale so I didn’t suffer the full blow of the 20 euro that this game is selling for.I would not recommend this for anyone with regular standards. If you however have a strong liking for dull storytelling, underdeveloped characters, anime characters whom look like they’re 12 years old and old-fashioned cheesy drama this would satisfy your needs."

,Recommended,315810,15342605,"Posted: 13 April, 2015",all,sorathecrow,"Pardon my rambling thoughts ahead, afterwards I'll break down some basic pros and cons.When I think about this game, I tend to gravitate towards comparing it to Narcissu.  Both are short kinetic novels, both deal with heavy topics like death.  But I think Eden* handles its topics a lot more interestingly than Narcissu.A lot like Narcissu, death is a looming inevitability on the minds of the main characters.  For Narcissu, the constant talk of death and hopelessness turns the story into a drawn-out slog with an inevitable conclusion.  The characters don't really grow or noticably change over the course of the story.  Eden* handles the same concepts in a way that is a lot easier to swallow.  It isn't a spoiler to say that the main heroine dies in this story.  But how it handles that character death makes all the difference.  Eden* uses every chance it gets to develop its main hero and heroine into interesting characters with detailed motivations.  Where Narcissu was primarily about picking a better place to die than a hospital, Eden*s characters  use their struggles with their own mortality (either due to physical illness or the approaching end of the world) to learn to live life to its fullest with what time they have left.Coming back and reading Narcissu again recently after having not read it for several years left me feeling depressed and almost...empty.  It was a soul-sucking experience.  But Eden*, despite being at times equally dark, sometimes even moreso because the characters were so much more three-dimensional, left me feeling uplifted and more positive about life.  I felt like it had really successfully communicated to me how important living my limited days on this earth to their fullest is.  So I think that's really a victory for this game's storytelling.Now that that's out of the way, pros and cons.+Great art.  This is subjective, of course, but if you don't mind the Key/Visual Arts-style GIANT ANIMU EYES, the spritework is great.  The occasional sweeping vista of fields or mountain lakes look great too.+Great writing.  I only recall seeing a few minor typos, and it all read very smoothly over the 7 hour experience.+/-  Music and general sound design was competent, but I don't recall anything hugely impressive.- This isn't really surprising to anyone that has played a visual novel before, but there are no resolution settings.  You have windowed and fullscreen.  I just played in windowed.Verdict: if you're looking for a book-like experience and don't mind moe-style eyes, pick this game up.

The reader is given the burden of shouldering all of the characters' emotions, building up to an obvious tearjerking ending that unfortunately, couldn't be happier.It does exactly what you expect, but does it brilliantly. The voice acting is extremely well executed and caught me off guard a couple of times with it's subtle but noticeable emotional nuances not written in text. Coupled with the characters themselves, it actually had me paying close attention to their voices to try and catch on their hidden meaning.The CG's are beautiful and do a great job at drawing you in with the extra animations every now and then, complementing it's artistic value with a more lively style of representing the scenery.This might be a recommended from me, but it can be a tough one to chew for some especially if you identify yourself in some of the presented situations.To summarize:eden* is a sad Love story about regret, atonement and -more than one kind of- acceptance.

Partly because my backlog these days is so massive that it is more than a little overwhelming, and partly because I had a sense this game would probably make me sad. Turns out both of these are true, particularly the latter. ;_;But... it's a nice little story. A bit predictable perhaps in that you can guess how it is going to end hours before it does, but not everything needs to surprise or shock. Also this is a ""kinetic"" novel, so there are no choices to make. Just read the text, listen to the voices, and look at the artwork.Good thing that all of those things are generally well-done. The art in particular stands out. The amount of CG's is staggering, the ""regular"" artwork looks just as good, and they even gave some attention to male characters here (unlike alot of other VN's XD). The voice acting works alright, and I was amused to find out that the male lead in this is voiced by someone who has voiced another male lead in one of the few romance VN's/animes that i've actually seen (Takasu Ryuuji from Toradora!). Lastly, I don't recall any parts of the text that seemed badly worded or mistranslated, so hooray for that.The cast is fairly small, but they are interesting even if most of their backstories involve something they regret or wish for. The male lead Ryou starts off as a cynical emotionally dead soldier who has seen far too much violence and lost sight of what he is truly living for. The female lead Sion, despite looking like a loli and beingwayolder than she looks, is a lonely high-functioning autistic who is a victim of her own genius and unable to really enjoy her life (sounds familiar ;_;). The rest of the cast, from the seemingly bubbly Lavie, the actually bubbly Maya, the caring big-sister figure Elica, and the regretful Major Inaba all play their parts in the story, but, since this is a romance, ultimately eden* is dominated by Ryou and Sion. As for them working as a couple... I've seen better, but I've also seen much worse. It's fine.So it's a relatively short (<10 hours) KN with superb art and decent story/characters. Also being a VN with a serious and emotional plot without any fan service nonsense is always welcome to see on Steam. I liked it, don't regret playing it, and that's good enough for me. :3"

And from that encounter, there lives where destined to change.This Visual Novel of Minori is absolutely one the best out there. As like every Visual Novel that Minori has made, this one doesn't have any choices and many routes. It has only one main route and one heroine but don't get taken back by these things because the story plot is totally solid and well-written. Every moment took me to the edge of my seat. What makes this VN standout is its way of affecting the player's emotions. The VN starts slow with but as you go deeper into the story, you begin to absorb the emotions expressed by each character. I don't know why but the VN's ending is quite predictable to me but the emotional delivery is what shot me down to tears.The VN has a great set of soundtracks as well. The visuals and art are totally magnificent. The protagonist is also voiced in this VN. (The protagonist's monologues are the only ones that are not voiced.)If you're a big a big fan of Visual Novels then you can't possibly miss this one. If you're new to the genre, then as early as now, prepare your heart for something very emotional. I recommend this VN to those who are looking for a VN that is well written, has awesome visuals, great soudtracks and has a solid story plot.I can assure you, you won't be disappointed with this because after all, this is......the last love story of the planet.My Personal Rating:Graphics: 10/10Music: 10/10Plot: 10/10Gameplay: n/a (it's purely a Visual Novel, no decisions are made)Overall: 10/10"

As a sci-fi thought experiment, it builds an intriguing world and history and then fills it with characters you come to care about on a personal level. Likewise, the tragic romance of Ryo and Sion is one filled with believable drama and real dilemmas that have no easy solution.

I played hours at a time, wanting to see what was next and was not disappointed. With some Visual Novels (VN), it should be pointed out there is no game here, there are no choices and this is purely a voiced graphical story similar to an amine or movie.  The voice actors were decent but were not able to live to full potential due to characteristics of some of the characters, but did as good as that would allow.The art was well done, but with most VNs there were a lot of re used images at times but nothing detracted from the story. This version is rated for Everyone, but the original is Mature, however I do not feel anything was lost with a few scenes being implied instead of shown.Overall I am glad I picked this up, if you are new to this style of ""game"" I would recommend trying the demo (if still available) and maybe waiting for a sale on steam.

To what extent justifies that a person is fully prepared?

The players would already know what is going to happen in the end from just the title and the first few minutes of the game. A style that is rarely used but makes what happened at the beginning crystal clear by the end. A story that connected each character it has ever shown to have a significant impact which was truly amazing on how everything can be seen as these keys that slowly but truly opens the door to that one path.The story (not giving a synopsis) is a simple one that means that character devolopments is key here. The way eden handled each relationships from family, friends, to even lovers were spendidly done. The lingering thoughts about someone important (aka flashbacks) really just shows the sentimental feeling and happiness from past events.The art was stunningly beautiful especially with the scenes showing nature in its full glory. The OST (offical soundtrack) manages to further cultivate the already existing emotions formed by the art, story and words. Making each emotion and scene that much more powerful, which made it truly mesmerizing as the story reaches its envitable climax.I never was much of a person to use the word ""melodramatic"" (as I love drama), this VN though was a great feels ride that leaves this sense of satisfaction at the end to the point that there was no need to further tie any loose ends.

I remember seeing it and having a grand amount of breathtaking moments with it. The story itself is fascinating however the route is limited and you are literally following through more of just a one route. Within the game, I fell in love with some of the characters and I do admit the game is great. To me this is a 9/10 work. Reason being is due to the nature of this game being pairing you with one route only. However it leaves much of you to think and as you go about realize a bit more about the characters and the settings. It's really drawn out and I admit playing this again brings back good memories. Now if we had this to come with the others previously over the years. Nonetheless this review is for this game, I recommend it for those looking for a VN with a breathtaking usage of work. Some would average it an 8 but I'll be honest, reading through it reminds me of relatable appreciation you have to some characters. However on buildup the 1 point lacking is routes, reason is we are all playing the same game then with the same result. A fundamental flaw that some many might not believe it to be but let's be honest, it's like seeing the same anime, just people get different views from it. Same with books. Moving on from that there seems a good backstory written to go with it but there seems to be some detachment less noted here which in my opinion could be included. The game itself has it's fine moments more than others I can say."

This was maybe the worst story I've ever experienced, in any medium.It should be, but isn't, broken up into two distinct episodes. The first half is a fairly decent, if cliche-riddled, suspense plot, and the second half feels like a too-long epilogue that eventually festers into 3-4 hours of syrupy, sentimental loli fetish scenes. In both halves, the story goes out of its way to deflate elements of narrative tension that it bothers to introduce, with antagonists literally just stepping out of the protagonists' way.The writing itself is verbose to the point of smothering the emotional impact that a scene might have. Characters will repeat a simple statement three or four times in the same scene, contributing to the problem of scenes that go on for 2-3x longer than they need to. There are many scenes that are repetitive or pointless (and still go on for 2-3x too long). Props, symbols, and images are repeated constantly, leaving them shopworn. Added for good measure is some cheap moralizing about taking care of the planet, the ""appetites of those in power,"" and a few other super-deep subjects. Ryou even says ""Sometimes, even pointless conversations can teach you a thing or two,"" without apparent irony.Speaking of characters, they're more stock than Getty Images. For brevity, I'll talk mainly about the Gary Stu protagonist: He kills without a flicker of emotion, flies a helicopter, cooks breakfast (which he does over and over), and generally does anything the plot needs him to do with no previous setup. He can also completely abandon his professed love for violence and following orders, opting to dedicate his whole life to taking care of his loli. If this sounds like it could maybe be a character arc -- trust me, it isn't. His change is quick, complete, and virtually conflict-free. His old life doesn't come back to haunt him or lure him back to his past ways. I think there's one line, as he's serving his bedridden daughter figure dinner or something, where he mentions not liking how domestic he's become, but he doesn't actually experience any tension or conflict because of it -- he keeps it up, getting even more pathetic as he goes along. He also treats the female lead like an idiot, points his gun at everybody, and does some highly rapey stuff to a throwaway character who's introduced toward the back end of the story. Great guy.So, what actually works in this game? The sounds effects, music, and voice acting are all fine to my ear. The art is nice, and really deserves a better story. I wouldn't mind this style becoming the norm for VNs. There's a warm glow to the scenery and lighting, and camera focus is used really well. The character designs are okay to good, and the blinking and moving mouths add to the immersion in a big way. But for whatever reason, characters tend to ""dance"" through three or four poses in a single conversation -- it can get a little distracting, like watching the exaggerated gestures and expressions of an actor in a silent film. Still, it's doesn't detract from the visuals too much, and some of the poses are cute.There are many, many problems with this game -- more than I've mentioned here. I can't recall being more disappointed."

Since there is not alternate routes/choices, replayability is what most people consider low since there will be no change what so ever. Yet, It's great playing this again once you forget about it, and come back."

The story involves the final days of the planet Earth which may seem like a cheap way to inject drama but, honestly, that part of the story may as well be an aside. The fact is that the main story is between our two main characters and it could have just as well been told in another setting while still remaining as powerful. It's very well written with one caveat...The pacing for the first half is incredibly slow. If you're not a patient person, you may have trouble dragging yourself through it. Speed reading or skimming along until the main characters get together wouldn't be a terrible idea if you feel yourself getting disinterested because there is a great ending to this story, despite the slow start. This is a long story and they get together at about the midway point so you won't be robbing yourself of much by skimming a bit. Lastly, just an FYI, this is a kinetic novel meaning there are no choices, branching paths or interactions.As far as the artwork goes, it's mostly top-notch. The characters are often incorporated into the backgrounds instead of the standard VN format of having a background layer with static ""pop-up"" characters in front of it. There are a few frames of Major Inaba that are comically bad and I question how they ended up in the game when the rest is so well drawn but aside from that, it's all very beautiful.In summary, it's a great story if you have the time (and a little patience) to put into it. A bit slow to start but it has a fairly powerful finish. I recommend it."

So beautiful, but so very sad!If you dont mind sad stories then i totaly recommend giving eden* a try.Really, if you decide to read this novel, then have your handkerchif ready, you will need it."
,Recommended,315810,16638477,"Posted: 22 June, 2015",all,FanarnarBoi,"IntroductionThe first thing that caught my attention, for better or worse, was the $20 price tag. I was skeptical at first, since I had heard nothing of this visual novel, and it didn't seem to be very prominent on forums or other gaming sites. Thankfully, the summer sale reduced the price to about $8, and I bought it. After reading all the way through, I completely understand the price point. eden* has absolutely gorgeous artwork, a sweet, melancholic soundtrack, an intriguing and engaging story, and complex, relatable characters. It was developed by minori, a small studio known for their most famous visual novel series, Ef: A Fairy Tale of The Two. eden* took me about 12 hours to read through with auto mode on. It is a kinetic novel, which means there are no player choices, just straight up reading.eden* was originally released as an all-ages VN, with an eroge side story named Mosaic releasing later. There is no sexual content in the Steam release, and you will not be missing out on any story or character details if you buy it here. If you're looking for something to fap to, you're in the wrong place. eden* was published by MangaGamer, who also brought Higurashi and Go Go Nippon to Steam.Premise and Storyeden* takes place in the near future, where mankind has predicted the death of the world. Scientists concluded that Earth will die in approximately 100 years, and began to frantically find a way to transport humanity to space to live on. Because of the pressing time limit and the magnitude of the situation, two major events transpire: all of the governments of the world join together to form the ""Unified Government"", and a certain doctor had the bright idea to genetically enhance a handful of humans. These creations are dubbed ""Felixes"" and their main perks are that they are intellectually superior, and their bodies stop aging after a certain point. These Felixes greatly accelerated the research for space travel, and a new project was initiated: The Earth Evacuation Project. The head of the project, a girl named Sion, is the alpha felix, the cream of the crop, if you will. The story revolves around her.Unlike most VNs, the protagonist has a name, a face, and a personality. His name is Haruna Ryou, a Warrant Officer in the Unified Military, who is assigned to a research facility in the middle of nowhere with the vague objective to ""protect it"". He has quite an impressive track record in the military, only volunteering for the most dangerous missions and showing no mercy or remorse. Most of his comrades fear him and respect him from afar. Another Warrant Officer by the name of Lavinia F. Asai (Lavie) is assigned to be his partner. I feel as though revealing more would ruin the experience, so moving on.Presentation and Gameplayeden* is a kinetic novel. There are no choices at all. Just relax and read through the story. Depending on how fast you read and if you listen to the voice acting (every character is fully voiced, Japanese only), it can take 10-12 hours to complete. It has a rather small native resolution of 1024x640, and there are various graphical options available.What sets eden* apart from other VNs is the characters being given life through subtle animations. They blink and their lips move when speaking, as opposed to the standard static image. One can turn off these animations through the options if desired. Functions such as saving and loading are not part of the text box, but reside in a small bubble that appears when moving the cursor to the bottom right corner of the window, Windows 8 style. That deterred me at first, but I quickly got used to it.Some of the highlights of eden* are its spectacular artwork and music. The use of lighting is fantastic, giving a bloom effect when outside and limiting it indoors to create an oppressive, somber tone. The characters themselves are simple, but attractive. Sion's large red eyes are incredibly alluring. The backgrounds are detailed and polished. Many of eden*'s still images are wallpaper-worthy. For most of the VN, melancholic piano music fills the silence. In moments of tension and suspense, it switches to a more chaotic, impactful rhythm. The music also plays a role in the storyline, which I find refreshing. eden*'s opening theme, ""little explorer"", is sung by Harada Hitomi.ConclusionIf you have $20 to spare and are looking for a good VN, look no further. eden* is a fantastic and heartwarming experience that gives perspective on morality and humanity. The art is gorgeous, the characters are diverse, the plot is engaging and impactful, and it will most likely make you cry by the end. Make the purchase. Spend the 12 hours. It's worth it."

I might be a tough person but even this ending was a tad watery. I suggest picking up eden if you want a solid story.

Even though the story got a tad boring at points, the interesting characters always got it back on track. The story is mostly focused on the emotions, thoughts, and conversations between the characters, rather than worldbuilding. I would have enjoyed some more in-depth explanations about the setting. Small complaints aside, the touching ending was phenomenaly done.Also, all sexual content has been removed from this game. Regarding censorship, I go back and forth. If a visual novel has a good reason to have adult content, it's totally alright, but, in the case of eden*, I think the narrative could be hurt by h-scenes. Either buy it from MangaGamer and support the forcing of h-scenes into visual novels that don't benefit from them or buy it on Steam and support censorship -_-Score:8/10"

,Recommended,315810,18864651,"Posted: 3 November, 2015",all,サカサマレトロビジョンズ,"I have pre-ordered this game a long time ago and actually haven't touched it for a while, having forgotten about it after a while.. One day, my internet was ♥♥♥♥ed, so I was desperately searching for some kind of source for entertainment and spotted this game on my desktop, which made me think - ""Oh, this game, I completely forgot about it!"". The first couple of hours into the game, I was constantly wondering how this story was going to expand from here, because for me, the ending was spoiled, due to the nature of the description given to this game. This, I thought, might make the whole VN underwhelming, but I was completely wrong. The overall shell of this VN is easy to figure out, in the early stages of this VN I couldn't help but be sceptical overall about this. The whole trailer type video shown in this page is also a big spoiler for me, as it shows the two main characters already in the mellow state. I couldn't stop wondering about how these two main characters, both seemingly cold-blooded with no humane emotions to be seen, were going to develop. This VN starts off in an oddly relaxing manner, it feels like this game's just going around in circles with its story at times, but after having finished this game, I can't help but appreciate the amount of time I was given to get attached to the characters (deeply, deeply attached). The pacing is incredible, looking back at how the whole entire story has unfolded, in a slow, majestic manner. This game knows to take its time with the story. This game seems to have all the time in the world, contrary to the inhabitants of this small world, the measly human race, desperately struggling to survive the end of the world. Things seem uneventful, duty for the main male protagonist also lacking any kind of action. The seemingly static storyline put me off at first, but as I've mentioned before, this is crucial for this story to have any kind of impact on your feelings, so bear with me on this and this game will show you its worth in full display. Something which has caught my attention very early on into this game is - the incredible dialogue between characters, it's seemingly flawless and the usage/timings of specific words are impeccable, they were incredibly poetic and have made me quite envious of the writer! The way this story develops is simply amazing, I couldn't expect when or how this story would expand, due to the nature of this VN, only sloooowly..and slooooowly.. revealing each and every part of the story, completely trapping me in the game, unable to stop pressing the space bar! I was so absorbed into this game, I had forgotten that it has become midnight, I had forgotten to breathe regularly and ended up having to do it manually! (I guess that's what you call ""breathtaking""?) Once the story had started to gain momentum in the storytelling aspect, it has gotten too interesting for me to let go of and time was seemingly flying! (though my clock says otherwise) The main female (Sion) protagonist's character development is astonishing, I knew something had to happen in her for this to be the ""Earth's last love story"", same goes for the male protagonist. And I was correct, something DID happen (what a surprise). The game had become a feels trip, I cried so many times and so much that I've lost count. ""I have become too attached for my own good.."" is what I was mumbling, while wiping my tears. *sniff* Yes, if you're wondering about the art and all the other things in this masterpiece, you won't be disappointed, though I expect you've already seen this game's trailers and what not, the art just gets better and better, same with the soundtracks, so you won't need to worry about these aspects being a potential sacrifice in order for them to have created the incredibly immersive and simply touching story. Sion's VA is incredible, she has simply pummelled my heart constantly, with her flawlessly delivered, impactful lines. So I have looked her up on the internet, only to find that she doesn't seem to be well-known at all and by that I mean - she hasn't been a part of many games/anime/vns so on so forth and it's very saddening for me, as I was ready to watch/read what other great things she might have had in store. This is the first game to make me feel my heart wrench, I have actually felt the pain in my chest and the inability to calm myself down from the sadness during and after. The ending of this game has left me in a dazzled state. As the credits were rolling, I was simply staring up ,while lying on my chair, thinking about nothing, absolutely nothing, as this game has left me speechless, accompanied by the feeling of emptiness.I give this game 10/10 with no doubt, this deserves more than just a glimpse. Delve into it, experience true melancholy and a feeling of amazement, followed by the feeling of accomplishment after having finished this game, which is truly worth your time."

Planetarian made me cry like a child and Grisaia made me gasp, but Eden didn't make me shed a single tear.Comparison with other VNs aside, the story in general was pretty bland. Whatever excitement I got from the ""research facility"" arc disappeared completely in the arcs that followed. It's like they tried to follow the mirror image of the plot mountain, starting with the climax and ending with exposition. The story became some bland slice-of-life between Gary Stu and Mary Sue. It did a good job tying plot elements together but it all felt unnecessary towards the end, messily resolving any conflict.It's a well-spent 10+ hour story, a calming ride, a relaxing experience... but it doesn't feel like it's worthy of its high ratings. I'm glad I bought this at a discount - I might've had buyer's remorse if I had bought this at full price."

The music and voices were also very well done and were not left lacking as in some visual novels. As if it wasn't good enough already the storyline and plot is just wonderful. I cry so much. Can't wait t see how the plot unfolds as I finish this masterpiece. Luv this game!!!

Both of the lead characters are extremely practical emotionally, so when the characters in the story show such little emotion it can be hard to get drawn in.  The main character is so stoic he can only make progress emotionally by experiencing invasive plotlines that cause the reader to wonder if “fantasy” should be added as a tag.  I guess I was hoping for a struggle - seeing the heroines struggle to accept emotion instead of a switch just being turned.I was ready for “the end” well before the story gave it to me and the time between when I was ready and the game finally did end didn’t add anything for me personally.  This is the first VN I have completed and when I went to ""gallary"" at the end felt no draw whatever to recall any certain parts of the story.  Generally, I find it hard to ever uninstall a VN, just like it can be hard to sell a good book, but I don't see myself mssing this one :(.Pros?   it is an interesting setting and if you aren’t extremely cynical you will probably personalize parts of the story and get some emotional ripples out of it.  The story is essentially “bird-in-cage,” “stoic heroines,” & “Save yourself and leave me to my fate.”  The animation was good and the project very good quality.  Only one storyline that will take around 10 hours or so depending on if you listen to the voice overs or click through."

Second of all this is just a story there are no choices made at all during the game from start to finish. Its a bit sad that is a short novel its about 10 hours long give or take. The art work is very well done as are the characters also Elica was my favorite.Now I dont see why they censored the gore in this. Its not like any one was cut into little bits or anything so it was like why?. Anyways It's worth buying if your into visual novel games 10/10.Now if you happen to get the other version from MangaGamer Eden Plus+Mosaic that was awsome. Still the same gamethey justed added the gore back into it and added 4 side storys. Each side story was about 30min so add an extra 2 hours to the game. Though two of the four side story where hilarious. Getting to have Elica be your personal maid for a day Best short story ever 15/10. I Want to take her home with me XD

I had a good time playing through it.If you're expecting a fast-paced story, you should look somewhere else (probably something other than VNs generally).The story was not fast, like previously stated, but still not too slow. It's a game you can enjoy playing, it's not something you have to divert all your attention to. However, this does not mean that it does not have something special and intersting. It's a very typical romantic story, but with it own twists.I felt the game as a whole was very well excecuted. It's not a game that I would be able to finish in ''one sitting'', but it's still the type of VNs that I would come back to and complete.The only drawback may be the pricetag, it can be a bit expensive.I recommend this game to any VN-fan who has some interest in love-themed stories.

The story is easily predictable and too romantic while lacking action scenes.

Nice graphics are just an add-on which is not a sufficient cause to buy this novel.I also feel a little disappointed as this actually is not a game - there is not a single choice to make, so you just click through the verses and watch CGs. Eden*, however is in the 'games' section of Steam, it also has deceiving options in the main menu 'save game', 'load game' and so on.In this case the price is unacceptable - it costs more than a movie, more than a book, more than a comic book and the ammount of content of the latter are supieror to eden*.

I didn't care much for his backstory.Although I loved the idea of spending time focussing heavily on characters and how characters interact with each other, it felt more like everyone was just magically in love with you even though you're a terrible person who hasn't actually gotten to know anyone. No one has any reason to trust or like you, but for some reason the game progresses as if you've been a good person.You literally catch a girl having a bath, watch her, point a gun at her, tell her to get dressed in front of you while you watch and think about how she deserves worse treatment, then check every nook, cranny, and inch of her body physically before tying her up so tight it leaves marks and leaving her all night in a storage room so hot and with air so thick she couldn't even breathe properly. She decides she's in love with you and later kisses you goodbye.I think that the voice acting is great, the artwork is beautiful, I love that it's animated to blink.

Just a simple love story, that they nailed out of the park. Overall reading this at about a medum pace, I finished in about 6 hours, if you want to power-read (and skip over the great music) you can probably finish in about 4 hours.Some negative aspects in my option are the amount of game-play was a little short, but that could just be me wanting more of this great story. Another huge negative, this VN has you making no choices, despite the fact their are about 4 ""choice options"" were the main character chooses for you. It is almost as if the writer wanted a branching story and got in a fight with the director who wanted a linar story. This aspect makes the game have zero replayablaty. 6 hours, you cry, your done. Keep this in mind.As far as the little extras go, the do have a ""memories"" section that allow you to look at sceens that you have already cleared, as well as listion to music already played. This section is pritty standed in most VN, what I am sad about is they dont have a screen-shot download (as far as I can tell) for the sceens, which is sad considering the art is pritty high quality.

There are no h-scenes or choices to be made but every character has their own voice actor to go along with their personalities.

,Recommended,315810,17888913,"Posted: 5 September, 2015",all,Ukiri,"Upon completing this game, I've never felt more compelled to write a review sharing just WHY this game is a must-buy for any person.  Truly, anybody.  I should mention, no spoilers in this review.  So newcomers, read to your heart's content!  Veterans, enjoy the ride.  :-)I never believed myself to be the visual novel type person.  Games where you just read text always seemed boring to me.  I usually play more RPG/Adventure type games where you actually DO things with your characters, not where there is a set, linear outcome.But this game truly altered my views on visual novels.I like to think of my myself as a rather ""tough"" individual when it comes to watching movies and playing games and not getting genuinely sad or ""immersed"" with the characters in the story.  Not so with this game.  I can count no less than 3 times when I had tears in my eyes playing this and many many other times when I felt concerned beyond what I can describe for the characters within this game's incredibly well-presented story.The story combines science-fiction with romance to create a very interesting situations.  And the use of suspense, oh my God.  The feeling of: ""NOOOOOOOO, not now!"" or: ""That's not good..."" will grip you and tear you apart all throughout the story.  It's fantastic.  Truly fantastic and engaging.The game's soundtrack is beautiful.  Although at points I have wondered: ""Oh boy, that song again?"" it does not detract from the game in any way.  Although a few times when it kicked in it scared me, I remedied the issue by turning BGM down just a tad in options.  Then no problems.I thought the art style was sort of weird at first, but now it is very appealing to me.  I guess it may be my sister's very awkward views on what is anatomically correct, but I promise this game's art is quite incredible and that my sister is full of crap.In terms of characters, their development, and how they change over the course of the story, I've never experienced anything quite like this.  Some of the most powerful scenes I've ever seen have come from this game.  I cannot applaud Minori, the creator of this work of art, enough for the beautiful creation I have just witnessed.  This is off the grading scale.I'd have to invent an entirely new grading scale to accurately rate how good this game is to me.  But I'll spare those details.I came, expecting it to be a ""crappy harem"" with a ""strange"" art-style and only one, ""dry"" ending.  Plus ew, all that text you have to read and potentially ""bad"" voice actors/actresses.I left feeling completely different.  Changed.  Soothed, if you will.  Also, I must say my prior judgements are unfathomly incorrect.  If you have any/all of those like I did, play the game.  You will see what I mean after completing the game.  You will be most surprised.The game has an overwhelmingly positive rating, and I am proud to contribute to that.  As my first ever review for a game, I am most satisfied it is with this glorious visual novel.  I played.  I cried.  I left feeling at peace and satisfied with my purchase.  Money well spent.TLDR:Recommended.  :-)  Very highly recommended.  :-) :-) :-)PS- And don't rush through it, whatever you do (I didn't, although towards the end I was quite anxious to see the ending, although I never skipped anything).  Enjoy it.  And remember, do not suppress your tears.  Or I probably would've cried a ton more, and especially audibly at no less than 3 parts in the game.  Part of enjoying games like these are to truly take in their beauty and let your emotion express itself, as it should be allowed to."

He enters a mysterious facility and meets a girl who has more to her than meets the eye. No, I promise you I have not confused eden* with Planetarian. That said, if you enjoyed Planetarian, then I think you are very likely to enjoy eden*.The visuals in eden* are good. In addition to having a variety of poses and facial expressions for each character, the characters are shown to blink and their lips sync with the voice acting. There are many CGs and each one is beautiful to see. Several locations even have multiple CGs and this gives the impression of a changing camera angle. I like it.As eden* is a visual novel, the topic of H-scenes should be raised. I did some research and discovered that the H-scenes are apparently bonus content to unlock in the main menu after completing the kinetic novel once. This means that the H-scenes are not at all relevant to developing the canon storyline. So don’t worry about characters suddenly referring to something that happened during a deleted H-scene. That said, I also read that the H-scenes add more depth to each character despite being non-canon. Anyway, it should be well known now that if you want to see H-scenes then you should buy directly from MangaGamer.The sound is good. The background music sets the mood well. However, it does not loop well because the end of the music fades to silence before starting again. The voice acting is good. I did not find any characters irritating to listen to. I think the emotions contained in the voice acting were appropriate for each character and the situation.The story is told using flashbacks, and it makes some of the plot developments easy to see coming. The setting is easy to follow. The plot is decent and enjoyable, but it is not great. The translation is good. There are a few instances when I think a native English speaker would find the text unnatural but the text is still grammatically correct so it can still be understood.Overall, I enjoyed eden* and recommend it to people who enjoy visual/kinetic novels. It is not a great kinetic novel, but it is good enough to deserve a place in the visual/kinetic novel library."

Since I'm a quick reader I managed to finish it in around 4-5 hours.The characters were fairly well fleshed out but it felt like the story spent much too long in the second half. However, spending that amount of time does make sense to properly convey the feeling of dwindling away. I personally would have liked that they would have spent more time in the first half to expand some of the minor characters a bit more.The art is pretty good and there are quite a few good landscape shots. The placing of the character sprites are less RPG-ish and they are placed in the room as if they are standing there instead of the RPG style talking-heads that most VN have.Overall, not the absolute best VN I have read, but a good starting point for anyone wanting to try the genre.8.5/10"

,Recommended,315810,17379663,"Posted: 4 August, 2015",all,Rox Robstah,"This is not really a video game. This is a kinetic novel, a visual novel that plays without any player decisions. It compares more with a novel or a movie, so those looking for anything resembling 99% of video games should look elsewhere, but those who are looking for an excellent story may look no further.As a game that is entirely based upon story, eden* delivers.eden* is a character-driven experience. Plot twists are used sparingly, and the story flows about as how you would expect. It is in the characters that the game shines. None of them resemble any cookie-cutter archetypes, especially those commonly found in anime or other visual novels. They feel human. They have a million different things on their mind, and the emotions attached to them are incredibly complex, and the game isn't afraid of discussing those conflicts inside each of those characters. It is especially apparent with the two lead characters' interactions; they understand each other's complexities almost absurdly well. It's a great joy seeing them change in even some minute ways as they face the very end.The orchestral soundtrack is excellent and accents the story very well. The visuals are refreshingly more dynamic than most other visual novels, showing scenes from ""camera angles"" beyond the usual cut-and-paste sprite approach. Hearing different voices in different ears depending on the placement of the ""camera"" is a nice touch if you wear headphones.As for downsides, the game is a little short. My record is a little bloated from semi-frequent breaks and waiting to hear all of the voice acting before continuing. The story was sweet enough that I didn't care.The pacing might be a little slow in the beginning. The game definitely takes its time introducing the characters' quirks and histories. Again, eden* is a character-driven experience, so I didn't mind since that's partly why the characters felt so complex.Finishing the game made me want more, yet the feeling of closure to the character's inner struggles also made me feel satisfied. Loved it from beginning to end."

,Recommended,315810,15435624,"Posted: 18 April, 2015",all,Humblebee,"A quote from Eden*. Technically not a spoiler, but just in case I'll cover it:We all have our tiny hellos and goodbyes every day, but nobody knows for sure when a long farewell will come. That's why we have to see each other eye to eye, so that when that final goodbye comes, we can say we had no regrets.This line is my favorite line from Eden*, and I really took it to heart. You never really know if the next goodbye will be the last.Consider this your TL;DR version:With a cute yet very sad love story, Eden* is out there with some of the best stories I've seen in a while. It's brought all together with brilliant characters, gripping story, beautiful art and astounding soundtrack.The story to Eden* is fairly simple. The world is coming to an end and the human race needs to evacuate into space to avoid being wiped out by whatever the world is about to be destroyed by. Out of the characters we get to know throughout the story, two of them refuse to leave the planet. Instead they take up a life of solitude in the mountains and live the last few days they have left in peace. It's not something that looks very good on paper, but in my opinion it's handled extremely well. It's not only the story itself that makes Eden* an amazing visual novel though, it's also the characters. How they feel about one another, how they interact and so forth. With all the characters you meet, you grow attached to them. And with all the farewells you have to go through, it quickly becomes a very sad story.The art... Not only is the art beautiful, it goes above and beyond of what a lot of other visual novels tend to do. The amount of detail and care that went into the art shows. A majority of the visual novel is not just one background with characters placed there like a lot of other visual novels are. Instead there are several backgrounds for a room from different angles. Also, the amount of pictures (not backgrounds where you can paste any character, but actual pictures with a character usually doing something already in them) is huge. The drawings give attention to even the little things that don't even really matter, making it a much more enjoyable experience in general. And to top all of it off, the opening is one of the best animated clips I have ever seen.I really recommend you click here and watch it. It's amazing.The soundtrack is one of the saddest yet most beautiful soundtracks I've ever heard. Pure and simple, it really knows how to set the mood for many situations. If there were an option to buy the soundtrack, I would probably do it.Negatives are a tough one to mention, since there isn't a whole lot to mention. I guess you could say that I am a little disappointed with some scenes and how boring they were, but that's just me. Not a whole lot of things during the prologue were very interesting, and some scenes in general felt like filler. Thankfully, a majority of the content is interesting and what little boring content there was doesn't really affect the story telling in any way.From a bunch of different visual novels that I've seen this stands out, because you can see how much effort was put into this to make it what it is now. If you're looking for a good, yet very sad story, this one is definitely something you should read."

Still interesting, though, and the first part does set up the story and characters nicely.Dunno about £15, but the game is worth owning if you're a fan of this kind of thing (I bought it on the opening sale).P.S. This Visual Novel has no choices to speak of or alternate routes, so replay value (in terms of alternate content - I'm okay with just replaying the same thing if it's good) is a bit limited. Take that as you will - I still got 10 hours out of the story, so I don't have a problem, but others might."

I found the Story to be decent despite some lingering questions.  Spelling mistakes in the english dialogue were pretty minimal and easily ignored.  I didn't have difficulty understanding it for the most part.The Artwork was great although I found male characters to be sloppy compared to female characters.  There were nice touches like blinking eyes and moving mouths.  The mouths unfortunately don't always move during speech and while playing the visual novel in windowed mode the mouth was somewhat unnoticeable for me at times.The Sound was good throughout although you will hear certain tracks (if not all of them) over and over again which can become annoying but the music is good and the voicework while it was abit irritating at a certain point early on it was for the most part solid.There really isn't any Gameplay but atleast I could save where I was and continue it later at anytime.  The most you can control aside from that is the flow of the story, window or fullscreen resolution and voicework.  If you just want to sit back and enjoy a story eden* will accomplish that.  If you're more interested in a game where you can be more stimulated this isn't it."

The VN is quite long, but this in itself isn't a bad thing. The story makes ample use of flashbacks / flash forwards to show how past interactions of the various characters affect their future situations, and to gradually show how various factors add complexity to what first appeared to be simple events (e.g. the main character getting assigned to guard a ""relaxed"" research facility, despite his special forces background). Having said that, the pace does feel sluggish at times. The characters are interesting enough, and their eventual fates felt reasonably realistic given the circumstances. It's not really a ""game"" (due to its linear nature), but if you seek a long kinetic novel with good production values, IMHO this is a good buy."

Thats just becuse i'm a bit of a pervert and decided i'd rather read the 18+ version, which btw changes the story in no way. It just adds some extra bonus 'alternate' scenes if you know what I mean. ;)First things first this is a kinetic novel, in other words there are NO choices, and therefore only one ending. The closest parallel I can draw from the steam library is Planetatian, which btw is another great kinetic novel, if a bit shorter.The story in this one is for the most part pretty predictable, in so much as you know what the ending is going to be basically from the get go. This is not actually a problem though as for this visual novel, it is the journey, not the destination that you will enjoy. The plot is vaguely similar to the anime plastic memories if you have seen it, and if you have then you will know to prepare for some hardcore emotions throughout, so make sure to pack some tissues.I liked all of the characters and enjoyed their interactions with each other, although the main character was perhaps a bit unlikable at the start but by the end he had really grown on me.The animation and CG design was really top notch, the artwork is one of the best i've seen visual novel wise. The soundtrack was good as well, really fitting the mood for the most part.To sum up, this is an amazing visual novel and is well worth your time to read it. Having said that, this is my first real review so It may be a bit shoddily written but I hope I have articulated how good this is.Personally I would suggest getting it on mangagamer though, I believe you get a free steam copy anyway, as that version contains bonus scenes that require just as many tissues as the main story, though for a bit of a different reason.
