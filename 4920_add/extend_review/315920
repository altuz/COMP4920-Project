While the idea is pretty good, there are a few bugs which can negatively influence the gameplay and overall experience, I still recommend this game since its really low price and few hours of nice gameplay that it offers...Pros:+ Really nice graphics+ Decent sound effects/music+ Enjoyable background story+ Xbox360 controller support+ Trading cards & Achievements+ Very low priceCons:- The parallel dimensions feature is not original- Some bugs can be annoying (Checkpoints disappearing from a level, difficulty setting not keeping your choice...)- Movement mechanics could be improved- While in-game compatibility with controllers is great, menu navigation isn't well implemented6.5/10Classic platformer, not very original, but worth the really low price."

Otherwise I would pass on the experience.  Loose controls, meaningless story, and bland design leave a distinct lack of impression with this Giana Sisters meats MeatBoy difficulty platformer.  It's competent enough, but very meh.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buUWZT9zjAA"
,Recommended,315920,18240763,"Posted: 28 September, 2015",all,The Colors of the Wind,Its a very tough game. It's a simple 2d scroller that has 2 dimensions for every level. Essentially you have to die almost 30 times every level once you get to the more challenging ones. It's the only way to figure out how to complete each level. It's fun for a hour or 2 but then just gets more frustrating as times goes on.tl;dr I only bought it because I had a 90% off coupon and its probably not worth full price

Whenever you are changing dimensions you are able to reach other area's and surfaces. The ""Dimension tree"" as i call it. is faster, jump higher and is able to climb so ladders. The normal tree is slow and can't jump very high but is stronger to defeat enemies.. But you have to change dimensions from time to time. Not only for completing a level but also finding some collectables or other resources. Collecting all the resources will reward you in score points.You are able to skip Cutscenes.Music is calm.Graphics and scenery are fine.There is Easy/Medium and hard mode.There is a tutorial (Not required to do, but recommended).Pressing the Start/Escape button, will show you the controls.There are secret area'sOther things.Game is pretty difficult and im not talking about the difficulty alone.After dying too much, you can't be arsed anymore about those collectables. They only give score points anyway.-------------------I Give this game a 7/10"

,Not Recommended,315920,18965210,"Posted: 8 November, 2015",all,Orlendis,Great concept but in my opinion requires you to switch universes and die over and over to get just a tiny bit farther than you were. You spend most the game dying repeatedly to get a little bit further than the last time.

,Recommended,315920,15566706,"Posted: 26 April, 2015",all,MatthewJet,The lack of options in the pause menu is a little short sighted. Although I don't see any reason to really need it. The puzzles are hard yet forgiving to new players if you feel like its too easy you can crank it up to normal and experience the puzzles with a new level of persition. Although the story isn't the most complex the puzzles are relaxing and not overwhlemed by sound.

,Not Recommended,315920,15531986,"Posted: 25 April, 2015",all,Zincoshine,"with a 90% sale I bought this on a whim, without doing research first to see if its actually good and has rebindable controls. It has neither and the current keyboard config is, while not being the worst, is pretty bad. The game itself seems acceptable but it suffers from the performance issues that braid, bridge, and schein have on windows 8. Finally, there is a serious problem with the dimention switching which has been highlighted by other reviews. A similar game called fractured soul seems to have avoided that problem by allowing both dimentions to be displayed at the same time in splitscreen."

,Recommended,315920,19223279,"Posted: 22 November, 2015",all,Chugger,"Stonerid is an Action, Indie platformer game that, despite the reviews at mixed, is a pretty good, and difficult, game. I can't say anything bad about, yet.In Stonerid, you are a tree, which can switch between dimensions at will, in certain places, that is. This alone is a pretty cool consept. The game tells a story of an OLD tree, whose main task is to solve the mystery of the toxic waste, now appearing unexpectedly on Atronast Mountain. This isn't the best story line ever, but it does send a positive message. The story bassically tells the story of real life as of now: a planet constantly being polluted. The only thing I dislike about this game, as I have said with others, is that your character moves around a bit too fast.Overall, this is an okay game. I don't dislike it, and I do recommend this cheap game to everybody. It really isn't as bad as people say."

This is that game. This game was about as fun as listening to hardcore Texas republicans debate the merits of non-traditional marriage.Pros:-It makes you feel better about your own amateur game design skills.Cons:-Pretty sure it was made with GameMaker, so you shouldn't pay more than a few cents for it.-It's not fun."
,Not Recommended,315920,16665194,"Posted: 23 June, 2015",all,rizlmilk,"This game is broken. It required me to teleport between two dimensions without any preview of the dimension I was about to teleport to. This meant I inadvertently teleported to a bed of spikes or missed a platform and fell to the bottom of the level purely because I wasn't psychic. The developers should know better than to make the player blindly jump from dimension to dimension. With games that have done the dual dimension mechanic correctly, like Guacamelee, there is absolutely no reason to ever try this game.Beyond that, the jump mechanic is very awkward and the animations are very bland. Even if it's on sale for half a buck, save yourself the hassle and stay away. Stonerid and Guacamelee aren't necessarily similar, but play Guacamelee instead if you haven't already because that game is phenomenal."
