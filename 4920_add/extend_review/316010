,Not Recommended,316010,29804571,Posted: 9 February,all,R.L. Stine,"A little background, I am both a big fan of the 'free to play' model as well as the Magic The Gathering card game.I've been playing Magic for about four years now.I've owned a few of the other digital game versions as well as having a few competitive decks in real life as well.It's been no secret that many people have found the digital series to be pretty hit or miss. I don't know what Wizard's of The Coast does to miss the boat so hard. But I'll first put this review into a technical and then a business sense:What works about the game:-Bare bones, the game launches, plays, has a GUI and from what I've seen as of February, very little bugs. It's a smooth experience to start and once you get into the interface it's an enjoyable segue into the game.-The music as always is top notch. I have yet to see anyone lodge a complaint against the music-Fair art direction. The cards already have art that they have on file so it's hard to say that they really go out of their way with the art on the cards. However, the 3D cutscenes don't quite match the style of the cards and come off more as a Nickelodeon spinoff of Magic; which, depending on your preference, may be a good thing.-The deck builder that everyone's been asking for is here. People complain about it not featuring a 'search by name' function. But I truly don't care. If you can remember the picture it takes all of about two seconds. And even if you unlock all the cards, it doesn't hurt to give your other options a browse while you flip to the card you want.What doesn't work-Now, before I get into the blemishes, it should be said that I generally enjoy the game but a review in my book is to tell people whether or not the product is worth investing in.-The RNG. The point of the RNG being so poor is obviously an incentive to get you to buy more and more boosters. Hopefully with your own money. An easy way to observe this is to play the story mode decks. The 'challenge' often doesn't come from having a winnable deck and being forced to outthink your opponent's cards. It's redrawing, and restarting the duel over and over and over until you get a really good hand, (Hopefully with good draws afterward) and sometimes even then, some duels I found were almost impossible to win unless the opponent suffered from several bad draws.-The Free To Pay model. Now, as I said, I love Free to Play. That's an awesome step forward with games with a competitive environment. I'll talk more about that in a second. But the problem here is that in the competitive side of the game, there's a huge incentive put on buying better cards than everyone else. Keep buy buy buying and hope your RNG gets you better cards than the other guy. A little RNG isn't bad, it keeps things interesting. However, when the incentive is to force the player to spend money when they would rather play with skill, then it's a waste of development time as you'll be seeing diminishing returns on your usage of those features.What's just in the middle?Well, between good and bad there's a few things that just sort of fall by the wayside.-The free cards you earn are not very competitive.Grinding for better cards can be fun. However, it shouldn't be done in the multiplayer against people with better cards, or at the very least not left to RNG boosters. Not neccessarily saying that the cards offered from the story should be perfectly competitive, but at least enough (if you've completed the whole story) to be able to play against starting level duelists.-Lack of dynamic matchmakingAs far as I can tell, there's not really any matchmaking algorithms in place to match you with people at your skill level. You seem to be matched with just whoever happens to be playing. This results often in playing against other players with much better or much worse cards than you rather than someone who offers a challenge and a fun game.-Lack of playersI don't know how many people actually play this game. But I'm judging that not a lot do from how long it can take to matchmake. I guess many people would just rather play the hard-format card game.Ways to fix it really simply-1.) First fix and probably most important: specifically two modes that I think will make the game even worth installing--Team battle: Basically, five players on each team (5v5) or (4v4) or (3v3) duel it out with premade competitive decks (similar to picking a hero in Dota, each deck has unique themes and abilities and once picked, can't be picked by the enemy team).This is going to be the main draw of the game. Teams can use game chat to speak to eachother, and make tactical decisions. Suddenly there's a team dynamic, and it's even better than just playing 1v1 with a friend.-Free battles: These are the current gametypes but reworked. #2 will talk about how to improve this mode. These are duels using decks that you've assembled yourself using the cards that are in the game. However, there can be certain rules applied:Legacy, Modern, etc.2.)Observe functioning Free to play systems: perhaps some of the best and most marketably viable free to play models are actually on Steam. Team Fortress and Dota 2 come with their own brand of users and you take them or leave them. Magic is much the same. However to make Magic work as an online game, all the content of the game needs to be free and readily available with balancing patches to control the meta game.The reason why this works: players can spend more time on the game getting better, and more competitive with the game. Switching the content you want to buy to cosmetic, makes the game more worth playing.3.) By switching the focus to cosmetic, people invest more time into the game. As they invest, they spend more. I hate to say it, but Dota found the magic formula. You spend X amount of hours and as X+fun=Financial investment.Now you may say, but that still applies to this game! However, consider that because it's also pay to win RNG, you've got to face facts and admit that you've also got, X+fun-(loss x loss conditions)=fincancial investment. The greater the amount of losses, the less likely that user is to spend money on anything in the game. Nobody except a very small handful of people with huge egos will buy boosters just to compete in a pay to win game. It's very niche. The rest of the people willing to buy are hardcore magic fans who are already likely to just buy hard copies of cards.Ultimately Wizards is in no financial trouble. However, they are walking away from a lot of money with this particular online game. By tweaking their approach by a bit, their financial rewards could be greater.Players however, if you are a huge Magic fan then you'll love that the game is free to play, but may grow tired of the monotonous grinding for boosters and long loss streaks in attempts to get better cards with less frustrating outcomes.If you're not a fan of Magic, but a fan of card games looking to install one on steam, then try it out.If you're not a fan of Magic and can take or leave a card game, then pass. There are plenty of other, (better) free to play games out there.If the game is updated to a state where it adresses some of its core issues, then I will happily update this review."
76561198006839107,Not Recommended,316010,30174329,Posted: 25 February,all,WTFlo,"I recently started getting back into magic after being inactive for around 15 years. However, other than standard tournaments, I don't have many opportunities to play against other players, so I figured I needed an online version of magic to practice. Magic duels is OK to get back into the mechanics and see what other people play, but other than that, it's a HUGE disappointment:- Insane grind. buying boosters as a poor kid in the 90ies (p2w in its pure form) was more fun.- Stupid deck restrictions: rares 2x, uncommons 3x (to keep serious players away or p2w low?)- Strange format: not pure standard, balance seems off ( banned smuggler's copter still being played, too many cheap removal spells...)- Terrible connectivity: connection losses all the time, dropped players get replaced by AI and most of the time, you have to beat the AI in order to not receive a loss, alt+tab is all it takes to get disconnected, possibly lots of room for exploits. Lags are so hard that often you can't hit the stop button to react to your opponent, which defeats the whole purpose of playing magic.- No possibility to interact with other players: no chat, no trade, nothing. Which might be wise, because...- The duels community equals the bottom of the magic community. You won't find many good matches, real magic fans are probablly somewhere else to be found. Often enough, playing a removal spell is all that it takes for your opponent to pull the plug and let the AI take over.... which surprisingly often leads to the AI coming back hard and winning a lost match... and then there are these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s just waiting everytime as long as the timer allows (playing a land after waiting for 1 minute) to make YOU unpatient and disconnect, giving them a default win.- Always playing against the same decks. Right now: red burn, topters, green ramp, sphinx tutelage. boring.- The campaigns are a joke. The way they try to tell stories is just unworthy of the magic universe. It's nothing but still images and written dialouge, combined with a muted 90ies-style render-cutscene at the end of each campaign. And the stories are just boring. It rather ruins the unvierse for me...- Presentation is rudimentary at best. Graphics are just the cards, a boring table, generic FX like fireballs and lightnings... even tablets could do better. There is only 1 music track playing throughout the whole game and it will drive you insane after the 2nd loop.I honestly can't find a reason to play this other than getting a very blury first impression of what magic the gathering is and that it's probably best to stay away from it lol. Do yourself a favor and play real magic or Xmage. I honestly can't understand the people giving this a thumps up. Probably the kind of people going to McDonalds when they're hungry and liking every♥♥♥♥♥♥on facebook..."
,Recommended,316010,29487800,Posted: 25 January,all,Mr Piddlez,"""Magic Duels is kinda like your hot crazy ex. She looks good and smells good, so you talk with her and start remembering why you loved her in the first place and want to try it again, and everything is great until she stabs you in the hand with a fork because you were chewing or breathing too loud. But sooner or later, you'll want to try it again.""ACTUAL REVIEWI've invested a decent amount of time and more money than I care to admit in this game, so I feel its time to give it an honest review.Pros+ Teaches you how to play MTG, So it's a good game to pick up for new players along with returning players needing a refresher.+ Atmospheric campaigns that introduce you to each new set while also earning you coins.+ Game limits your collection and deck to only one mythic, 2 rares, 3 uncommon, and 4 common cards of any individual card. This creates an artificial buffer and prevents players with too much money/time from building crazy decks that will dominate the metagame.+ Finite amount of cards for each set, meaning eventually you will have every card in the set. With older sets going on sale every so often to help build your collection more quickly.+ 150 coin price tag is very fair for a booster of 6 cards. Winning a multiplayer match earns you 30 coins plus any bonuses for completing weekly and daily quests means you can unlock at least one new booster every day with a decent deck.+ Every set since Origins has been included, and they continue to add new blocks as they come out, with some card exceptions that would be too complicated to code in a vs format.+ All the fun of FNM, minus the smell.Cons- Mana tapping system needs work, though there is a mana tapping key, often times it either doesn't work correctly or is just too clucky to use in the limited time you have to play your turn. Nothing is more frustrating than a match going sideways because the game chose to tap the wrong mana for you.- Game is very buggy at times, I had to leave a match I was winning because the game refused to unzoom a card and blocked my view of the battlefield. Another time, the game froze on the ""opponent watching animations screen"" and it cost me the match.- Game has been out long enough for there to be enough ""auto include"" mythics and rares between all the sets to make it frustrating to play vs battles at times. I've run out of fingers and toes for the amount of times I've seen ""Combustable Gearhulk"" in any deck that has red in it.- Game really favors the constructed format of the game, which can be jarring/frustrating for players that like to play limted formats like draft, sealed, and pauper.- Plainswalkers dominate the game. Some are pretty benign, but you'll see the frustrating ones enough to make you walk away from the game at times. (I personally haven't liked plainswalkers when they were introduced years ago, At least back then they were reasonable being 6 drops with something along the lines of ""+1: Target creature gets +1/+1"" not 4 drops with ""+3: Make game unplayable."")- No In-game chat with other players. (I would probably get banned if we actually had this, I'm humble enough to know I can be a sore winner/loser.)-All the frustration of FNM, minus the smell.I really like Magic duels, but I also hate it just as much. I've lost count of how many times I've walked away from the game, never to play again, just to find myself back again in another duel 30 minutes later. I honestly think you need to be a little bit of a masochist to enjoy this game.If you like MTG, you'll feed that itch with this game. If you want to learn MTG, this game is a good jumping off point. If you want to stare blankly at the screen in a silent burning rage that could fuel a thousand suns, this game is for you."

The Story Mode and Skil Quests are great to introduce MTG's mechanics. But some issues ruins all game:- Turn will complete automatically if I have nothing to play. Do you realize that it gives too much info to my opponent? Especially if I am playing control deck.- UI is awful. Did you try to rename your deck? As a gamedeveloper myself I can't imagine how did you manage to hide this so good- UI is still awful. When a spell in a stack you can zoom it to read some information from the card. You have to right'click it and select ""Zoom in"". My God, it's the only item in this context menu! Why should I select it when I have no other options?Anyway, all this problems can be fixed and I hope you will do it, community will be thankful (just kidding, community is never thankful)"

Nothing to add thereThe Mana tapping is extremely finnicky and often doesn't work at all. There is literally no point in tapping specific lands to spend by yourself because the game will just pick whichever it wants anyway.Timer stop occasionally doesn't work, sometimes you want to play a card and the game simply doesn't register it and the timer counts down.The shuffler is flat-out broken, specifically the mana spread. A lot of people complain about either constantly drawing mana and losing, or, more frequently, drawing little to no mana at all despite having an appropriate ratio.Calculations and Experiments(!) have been made to prove the impossibility of the mana shuffler if you were to assume it does not in fact contain a bad bug.So please, by the gods guys, your game is otherwise so enjoyable, just fix those bloody bugs!"

It is similar enough to MTG to be worth playing and the in game booster pack system is not outrageously priced (compared to other 'freemium' games out there).That being said, the game is unstable. Crash errors occur in online and single-player quest modes. The customer Support option in the game only takes you to a page that you need to have a WotC login ID to access.Fix the glitches and I may reccommend it.Also, Wizards needs to have a REAL support contact system enabled."

76561198031957285,Recommended,316010,30076064,Posted: 21 February,all,SheffSlacker,"Magic The Gathering is an easy game to learn and a very difficult game to master no matter what version you play (original physical collectable card game or any digital rendition that has been made over the years).MTG Duels is a free to play game, and even if you stick to playing just the story mode and completing the challenges that the current 7 stories which complement the 7 decks available in the game, it will offer you a good few hours of enjoyable gameplay.To be honest it offered just as much enjoyment and gameplay as some of the other MTG: Duels of the Planeswalkers games that you have to pay for on Steam.If you are new to MTG then this is a great way to learn the game and get to grips with the mechanics of the game, and if you are like me and have played MTG on and off for over 18 years, it was a great way to get back up to speed with some of the new abilities introduced in newer decks.  The game offers Skill Quests whenever you encounter a card with a new ability and guides you through a simple scenario where you get to see how that ability works.By playing through the story modes and completing the Skill Quests you will accumulate a reasonable number of in game coins that can be used to purchase booster packs of cards for you to build your own decks from.  You can then venture in to playing against friends or matched opponents online, solo battles against AI, and two headed giant duels.  This is where the game does encounter some issues.  Playing solo against the AI is fine and you can earn more coins depending on the difficulty level of the AI player.  The online matched duels unfortunately has issues.  The matching is very poor and novice/new players with only a few cards/boosters and relatively weak decks frequently get matched against players that have either played for a considerable time and earnt a significant amount of coins, or bought coins in game and then spent them on lots of boosters and built fast, powerful decks.Overall if you take the game at face value and view it as a free to play game that will offer several hours of enjoyable gameplay working through the story mode without having to spend a single penny then it’s well worth installing.  If you are looking for a challenging game that rewards you for spending a considerable amount of money to be able to purchase new booster packs and build powerful decks with a collection of virtual, digital cards then you may be better looking at playing MTG Online.  For me, if I am spending my money on collecting cards then I would much sooner buy the real things, sit around a table with my friends and play a real game of MTG.Pros:Free to playGreat tutorials/Skill Quests that help you learn the game and advanced abilitiesEnjoyable story modeCons:UI could be betterOnline “matched” game very poor at finding a matched playerSome bugs still exist in the game (but sure they will gradually get ironed out with future updates)"

I had to give it a thumbs up, eventhough I kind of feel bad doing so...Duels is a very nicely done digital version of Magic: The Gathering. The overall appearance and designs look terrific, there is a vast amount of cards to collect and the interactive tutorials provide a straightforward introduction to the sometimes very complex game mechanics. The AI seems impressive to me (eventhough I can't profoundly judge this, to be honest, since I'm no Magic veteran...) Collecting coins to buy new cards and improving your decks turns out to be extremely addictive.I can HIGHLY recommend this game for people who:- Want to learn how Magic: The Gathering works- Enjoy single-player mode- Don't mind playing dozens of hours only to get a slightly improved deck that will most of the time still not be able to keep up in multiplayer- Don't want to play dozens of hours but are willing to spend quite some money to buy new cards...WARNING!!--> However I can NOT recommend it entirely because of two significant shortcomings:- It is not possible to sync different platforms! You might want to play, say, on your way to work on a mobile device, which is of course possible. However, running Duels on a platform other than your regular one, you will neither be able to use already collected cards nor to save your progress (e.g. earned coins) to your normal account which makes it rather pointless.- Most decks you face in multiplayer are insanely overpowered. Just forget using a deck which to a large extent consists of cards from the intro pack you get for free. It is of course possible to boost your collection with new cards, but to do so you will either have play 100+ hours to get some decent decks or throw an awful lot of money at Wizards (which is of course what they intend).As my time and funds are limited, this is what kind of spoiled this game for me. However, you might still give it a try, since it's free!TL;DR: I gave a thumbs up - but on balance I still can't quite recommend Duels. As always with these kind of games you will have to spend quite some money / a lot of time to be able to really compete with other players. But if you only want to get to know Magic a little, then just go for it!"

Unless you're spending money it's impossible to stay current. They've recently made most of the quests to obtain more coins geared to VS battles, which you have no real chance of winning unless you've spent real world money in the game, making it even more difficult to stay current. You can only use three of any given card and one planeswalker card (which is different from the actual gamerules...WHY???). Overall this is a poor cousin to the physical card game.

Also, pros for this game is that it is mostly stable (it tends to crash very seldom, but no game is perfect in that regard), and the UI is very easy to navigate. Also, with the latest update, they've made searching for specific card types while deck building much easier.One huge con though: The matchmaking system doesn't reward players for having a high rank, nor does it penalize them for having a low one. This may seem like a non issue on the surface, but what it causes is many high level players will ""tank"" their rank to face low level players who haven't unlocked the more powerful cards. The abundance of players with extremely over-powered decks will keep their ranks low by mass forfeiting in order to coin farm against lower level players is disgusting. It needs to be addressed. My suggestion would be to adjust the amount of coins you recieve for winning a Versus Battle by rank. For example: For ranks 1-5, a win would be worth 10 coins instead of 30. When you reach rank 6-10, a win could be worth 15, 11-15 would be worth 20, 16-20 would be 25, and so on. I will be submitting this as a suggestion directly to the devs.Another con is that at off-peak hours, it can take a very long time to connect for a match.All in all, though, a very good but simple MTG game for players that want a more casual experience."

If the other plauer is doing something, you can't do anything. Then when he's done, the game seems to jump to the next step in a matter of seconds, not giving you the chance (same length of time) that your opponent had.

The decks in the story mode are mostly not fun and it feels a bit shattered, but there are moments that it is fun. Unless you are willing to pay, it takes a while to gather cards to make a fun deck. But again it is free. The usual iteration cost $10, so you could argue spending that on getting cards. I haven't spent any yet. The long haul method of gathering coins from wins to buy cards is more fulfilling though ultimately more boring perhaps. But it is free to try either way. Why not reccomend it on that?"

76561198125277887,Recommended,316010,29412444,Posted: 21 January,all,wild_blunt_hickok,"I WOULD recommend this game to others. I've been playing Magic The Gathering (with real world cards I mean) since 1995 or so. Going into Magic Duels I was worried that it would be too ""pay to win"". It's not. Yes you can pay real world money to get more coins to buy cards but you can also earn coins from just playing (only when you win a match of course) and the speed of coin gain isn't too slow. I'm a firm believer in not paying for microtransactions so I'm grinding away at the free path, and it's pleasently reasonable about the pace. You can play against other people or against an AI, 30 coins for beating a person or 15 for beating an AI, and 150 coins will buy you another booster pack (6 cards with 1 guarenteed rare). If your deck isn't good enough to play against real people at first you can just battle the AI until you have a good enough deck for fighting real players. It's got 7 different expansions to choose from, with each having it's specialities (I often pick the one that specializes in werewolf cards).And the thing that really seperates it from earlier Magic video games is there's no end goal. In previous ones if you had unlocked every level and unlocked all 20 locked cards for each deck you were basically ""done"". No such thing here. There's no set decks (maybe there is for people who pay real world money), there's just ""build your own from the starter boxes and the cards you get from boosters"". Which is how Magic is supposed to be anyway, so it's a welcome change. But it means decks are completely open ended, you'll never feel like you're ""done"" making that deck. Or if you are there's always new decks to make (""hey I don't have an elf deck yet"").One other thing: since it never feels like you're working towards completion you never feel pressed to have a marathon session of the game. This game works great as a breather between playing other games. ""Ok enough Minecraft for today, I think I'll play 2 hours of Magic, then switch to Borderlands 2"". Maybe at the start you're hard pressed to get your deck good enough to play real people but other than that you can just play for the fun of playing rather than to work towards a goal. Which, once again, is how Magic The Gathering should be."

Well balanced compared to others (and I've played a lot) and extremely flexible with how you play. The wisdom that comes with age definitely shows in MGT.The only gripes I really have about this version of MGT is that not all card sets are complete... even if you get 100% of the cards from a set in this game, there are still many cards within sets in real life that don't appear here and I would very much like to see this to be able to make more creative decks, as well as producing improvements to current decks.As a direct result of this, competitive gameplay on this version of MGT is very restricted to play to a small ""meta "" and being forced to play with the recent sets, which I enjoy, but it would be nice to be able to have viable decks from previous card sets.Having to earn or buy the new additions the same way we buy boosters now would be absolutely fine.I would like to see the standard format introduced for ranked games, which would forbid players from entering  the ranked queue if they have any illegal card within the format, but still have a free versus mode where you can bring whichever cards you like. To allow new players to gain gold and be able to participate later in a standard ranked ladder, have the free Vs mode reward the current 30 gold upon winning, and maybe 40 gold for winning a standard ladder match.I mainly say this because in ranked matches, cards that have been deemed too strong for the standard format are still prevalent in the current ladder (Smuggler's Copter for example, for those familiar with the game and ban lists).Finally there are no social mechanisms in this game... the ability to speak to opponents and allies during a match (and an option to turn off this chat for those who do not wish to chat) would be great. Perhaps also introducing a friends option as well as I do not wish to flood my entire steam friends list solely with people who play Magic Duels.None of these things will stop me playing any time soon, but I feel they're essential for the longevity of this platform of MGT."

The tutorials in the story mode do a great job of illistrating card interaction, turn order, and play sequencing at a basic level.  The interface is user friendly and has an entertaining appearance.  The limited card pool has tested my deck builing ability and forced me to play deck archetypes that I would not if I had a more robust card pool.  It's fun to see ""less competetive"" strategies do well in this more causal environment.I would like to see the turn structure expanded to include each pass of priority in order to allow more interactive play sequencing.

However, there is a serious amount of grinding involved in order to gain access to competitive cards and the game itself is very basic. There is no chat available and the gameplay styles are limited to 1 v 1 and double headed giant. While there has been recent improvements to deck building, searching through your cards in order to build a deck is not intituive nor particularly easy. You cannot search for a card by its name and there are rumours that the developers do not intend to impliment this function. Instead, you can attempt to search for cards via limited filters, but both experienced players and players who are new to the game may find themselves disappointed.The main weakness of the game is probably the grinding.

The mini-campaigns are fun and a good way to introduce the various card sets, but it'd be nice if you had some reason to play through more than once. Once you complete the campaigns the only way to unlock currency to spend on new cards is to play MP or grind through tons of annoying SP battles (for a max of 15 coins per battle, needing 150 to unlock a single booster). This wouldn't be so bad, except the game itself is plays really slow - making you wait for lots of repetetive animations and forcing each match to be a lot longer than they need to be.

The story mode gives you the illusion, that there is a possibility to earn enough good cards to create a good deck, but its still an illusion. Even if you spend some money, it will not be enough. You have to spend a lot or your money is wasted.- A booster has only 6 cards for a real price of 1.79€. Thats pretty expensive for a few virtual cards in comparison to a real card booster. The only advantage is, that you cant get cards double. Because of this, it is best to focus on one edition to get at least all good cards from one edition (if you spend tons of money).-The battle interface is poorly designed. If the developers would have spent half the time they took for animations to create a good battle interface, the gameplay experience would be much better-You even have to buy your Avatar from a limited selection.

The one thing that finally made me quit was the introduction of daily quests with very specific requirements that only work in PvP.  Even with a daily quest refresh, this often ends up requiring you to use decks in PvP that are substandard either because they don't fit the meta or you don't have enough cards unlocked to build them.So, in short, the best way to unlock cards now often depends on already having cards unlocked. In PvP.I understand this was probably an effort to get people to buy boosters. The game does need to make money or it gets shut down, of course. And while there are things I would pay for, boosters are not one of them. I started playing Duelsspecifically to get away from having to pay for boosters. If Stainless wanted to get money from me there are some things they could charge for:Access to older blocks (i.e. ~$5-10 for a block that comes with a few boosters, then you have to unlock the rest with earned or purchased coins)Access to alternate game modes like Sealed (where you don't keep the cards), Vanguard, Commander, etc.At any rate, it's still a better game than Hearthstone."

Yes, you get quests to gain a bit more but these are daily and really make a small impact on coin gain. And each ""Booster pack"" costs 150 coins which only has 6 cards... yes 6.  In comparison, you get 15 when buying real packs.The main problem with this game is new players start with a very small card pool from finishing the campaign and the starter cards.This makes it VERY difficult to compete with other players who have either payed a ton of money to unlock cards or have grinded for months. The game has a ranking system on how many wins you have NOT the strength of your decks. I have been playing ranked matches against 1-7's and i'd say 90% of those ""LOW"" ranked players I'm matched against have unlocked most of the cards in sets. Because too many of them seem to have a lot Legendarys and Plainswalkers.So say you want to pay around how much the previous DOTP games cost including their expansions(around $40) you'll have enough to buy roughly 50 ""Booster packs"".  That's only HALF of one of the 7 sets.So final verdict:I can't recommend this to anyone that wants to pay around the same as the last games in the series and get their moneys worth.And for those that don't want to pay: Hope you have a lot of time on your hands fiend.....Because  At the time of this review I had logged 57 hours and In that time I've only unlocked 27% of one of the 7 sets.

Matchmaking can take as long as 1 hour, and the game is filled with glitches and hackers. Half the time, it crashes. If you want to learn and play this game, I strongly recommend play the real, paper game. It is more rewarding, you make more friends, and heck, the booster packs even come with 15 cards (in Magic Duels they come with 6)."

So, it's rather frustrating when games don't let you continue past the very beginning of the game without going online.Other than that, the games great lol. I just don't see why going online is required.. especially with so much of it being saved data that comes with the games initial download."
,Not Recommended,316010,29767604,Posted: 7 February,all,<™[-=> Cookiez <=-]™>,"This is Magic the Gathering in a hassle free format compared to the physical version. It is reflective of the current cards in play. While this game is pretty neat, the constant paywall is still preventing people from fully appreciating the game. It would have been better to just remove the gambling element of MTG and let their fans buy an entire set of cards. The rarity creep is a bane on their game.Conclusion, Magic Duels is still a Pay To Win Game. The best price is at 7500 gold for $53.48. Each booster pack costs 150 gold each. Since they control the system online, Magic Duels can actually give you non-repeatable cards.PROS1. The StoryI like playing through the story mode a lot. While I have already read the story of the Planeswalkers online, it was enjoyable to play the story. Since I enjoyed this part, I believe I am a Johnny. I don't memorise the entire card deck, so I can't be a Spike.2. Neater SystemIt's all stored online so you don't have a mess. Every bit of nitty gritty is calculated for you and you won't forget actions that are easily forgettable. E.g. Actions that are taken from the graveyard once something occurs.CONS1. Pay To WinYou still need to pay coins for the booster packs.2. No TradingSince you can't trade the cards, there is no secondary market. Without the secondary market, the rares have no value. In real life, the physical copies are plain paper anyway and can be printed by Carta Mundi in the millions.3. Cut scenesVery ugly. I would have preferred moving artwork instead. The cut scenes reminded of video graphics of old games like Dungeon Keeper.4. Rare CardsAnother problem with these TCGs.5. Minor BugsSometimes, some of the abilities don't show up. I've uploaded screenshots.NEUTRAL1. Completing Campaign Rewards a Starter BoxAt the end of a full campaign, you gain a starter box full of cards of that set. While I like the idea, knowing that the pay to win is still existent does not fulfill it enough."
,Recommended,316010,29471271,Posted: 24 January,all,strong.christopher23,"Great game. Very much encompasses what magic is, teaches you at a decent pace, everything can be bought from coins earned in game (even by doing thhe tutorials). From someone who plays this IRL, it is nice to have a game that is the same as in person without having to shuffle the decks. In addition, the key selling feature to me is that when you buy a certain number of in-game ""booster packs,"" it completes the set. As in, you now have all the cards in a set number of boosters with NO chance of getting, say, 20 Reckless Waifs with no rares or legendaries.There are some bugs.  Some games get dropped. Some of the time, when there are 40-60+ permanents on the field in Two-Headed Dragon, and someone pulls out a F*%&#NG Artificial Construct, the game crashes. And you die a little inside. Pretty much any card that affects more than one person, late game, in two-headed dragon can crash the game. But then you get to reflect on your life, suck it up, take a shot, and play again. And victory is sweet when 5 wins equal a booster pack.Yeah with all of the new cards and gameplay fixes being added each patch (like the recent ""A player MAY"" rule being fixed) and the double coin weekends and the booster sales, I'd say that this free game is well worth the download. And just to be clear, you can spend your money, and it is well worth it. I think I played a few games and the tutorial and Story Mode and spent 40$ (the price of ONE of those megaboxes at most stores that only comes with like 16 boosters) and got a whole set. And half of another one.TL;DR: If you like MTG you will like this game."

If you are not rich or dont like grinding for hours to get little profit, leave now. When I downloaded this game I was hoping for a real MTG experience that would be fair and fun, what I got was an absolutely broken game.The matching system is horrible, often pitting you against players with decks far better than yours.The rich kids own the game. Magic duels gives you the option to buy coins ingame to give you a massive edge against the other players, therefore if you dont pay, you are going to have a very terrible time trying to get past all the rich kids that buy literally everything. The game also gives you the option to earn coins through quests (usually enough to earn about 1 booster a day) and a way to play against AI opponents to get 5-15 coins a match if you win (A single booster is 150 Coins). Also the game does not give you the normal 15 cards in a booster that it should, instead you get 6. During a versus battle if the opponent happens to leave the match for any reason, you will get pitted against an AI that can be either better or worse than the person you were just fighting.

By far, the worst problem is the interrupt timer. Rather than letting you agree to move to the next stage or let something resolve, there's a timer that you have to interrupt if you wish to play something, and unfortunately, the timer doesn't work very well. It doesn't last very long in the first place, so looking away for a second could lose you the game, and even if you try to stop it with time left, it doesn't always stop. There also seems to be a limit to the number of times you can stop it in a row, so if you need to do multiple moves at once, you may just be out of luck.2. This isn't as huge a problem, but it's easy to play the wrong card from your hand. You can try to click the card that's on top, and even though you're clicking where the card is, going too far to the right or left can suddenly switch another card to being on top right as you're clicking.3. There are frequent connectivity issues, and long loading screens. It's like all the time you wish you had on the interrupt timer gets spent waiting for the game to work.4. There are so many no-brainer features and options that aren't available. Seriously, we can't name our decks? We're suck with ""Deck"", ""Deck[1]"", ""Deck[2]"", etc. if we use the editor? The filters require pulling up an entirely different screen with multiple tabs to set up. The interface feels like it's from the 90s.If you want free Magic play where you can actually build your own deck, this is it, but the gameplay issues are incredibly frustrating."

Really though theres plenty of addiction to be found and a potentially bottomless well of digital drugs to buy with micropaymens, it'll only take you more money than a real deck of MtG cards to get all the fake ones you can restrictevly play with here.Unfortunately the servers are a bit wonky when trying to get a two headed giant game going. You cant test real decks because of card quantity restrictions (1 Mythic, 2 rares, 3 uncommons, 4 commons of the same kind in a single deck). You cant communicate with anyone which makes Two headed giant an exercise in prayer that your random partner is able to predict your moves and you theirs.It's an okay skinner box with a few too few pellets to keep one intrigued.

No reason to invest a dime since WOC has already said they are planning on a new version of online magic. Google it. Reviews you've read about farming to get all the cards were most likely early game players. AI will never have mana or creature problems and has full sets of cards (4 x each card in it's deck). Easy mode is hard at times because of this. They will play an attacking 9/13 artifact creature against you on turn 5. If you're trying to farm like me it's very frustrating because you have a patchwork deck and wins only get you 5 coins. With boosters costing 150 coins and you only get 6 cards to a booster...Positives- Hey it's magic. You can learn a lot about the rules/ mechanics if your a newer player.

Matchmaking is a bit of an annoyance especially when one is placed against higher ranking players. Quests are easily completed daily.What should be considered is being able to get more Myhtic cards. I can understand limiting them to one card, but there are lots of decks that usually have two or more mythic cards.A Chat system for Two headed giant. When you have another player with you, it's hard to communicate to them which spell you want them to use. You have to rely on them if you want to get a good combo going. In addition, the AI that gets replaced. I've had my own AI partner counter my spell, this is a problem especially if you're going against humans.The card collection should be increased; primarily for the dual lands.

,Not Recommended,316010,29568845,Posted: 29 January,all,Cog,"As a long time Magic the Gathering player, Magic Duels is 95% disappointment.The free to play model has broken the satisfying progression of the earlier games (Duels of the Planeswalkers).  Starting the game and playing through the various Planeswalker's stories isn't bad, and is the best part of the game.  But once you're through that you only have one-off battles against the AI or online.  The problem is these games do not net you enough coins, the currency that you use to buy booster packs to get new (and better) cards, and turn the game into nothing but a slog.  Earlier games introduced new cards through unlocks, and the balance was done well, rarely overwhelming you on the next step forward.  In Magic Duels your stuck playing inferior cards unless, here it comes, you spend real money to buy coins to buy booster packs.Of course, you can't fault them for wanting to make money.  But then then question becomes, ""If you spent as much money as the cost of one of the earlier Duels of the Planeswalkers games to get coins and then boosters, would that make Magic Duels comparable, or even enjoyable?""The answer is a pretty solid ""No.""  First of all, the card pool is not near as good, having unexciting rares and mythics.  Second of all, you'd have to spend a lot more money to obtain the entire card library where in earlier games it could be done through mostly enjoyable games.The online matching is poor, creating unbalanced games.  Perhaps that is because of a limited pool of players.And the games sports an annoying number of interruptions trying to get you to spend real money.Really, free to play might be the entire reason for this game being a bust.  And it's not free to play.  I had to spend 20 hours to find out that in the end it's a waste of time and not worth the effort.  I would have spent $50 for a good new Duels of the Planeswalkers game.  I won't spend a penny on Magic Duels."

I am not moaning, but its a issue which at times destroys the fun of playing magic the gathering online, I think of magic the gathering as a tactical game like chess.2) Match making is 'broken' and a pain in the teeth. The dev(S) need to fix this issueI have been ranked 1 and if lucky to 4- but most of the time when I get a player he is like 10 or more most the time and has a super flawless deck, with rare land cards that turn to creatures and cards which dry the other players cards in library and life, and like 8 plane walkers and legendary creature cards, even the one mana cost cards do serious damage, like two turns he wins and your like, for gods sake, had no chance, even with a well balanced deck 60 or 100 deck.Despite the two things I mentioned, you will not always get tough players with silly powerful decks, its best to concede a duel if you do and find another player that has the same or near the same ranking as you with similiar deck, you will have  a fair game at least.

Especially since the game handles many of the complexities, that otherwise makes learning m:tg a harrowing task. As time, and m:tg expansions, have passed, it has also acquired a diversity, that Duels didn't have from the outset.For the more experienced player, it is still magic, even if you do not get your favourite cards in your favourite amounts (commonly held to be 4). This makes deck-building a continous challenge, as it is impossible to merely copy decklists from standard.The only thing I'm missing for real, is chatting to online opponents. Not that everybody in the earlier iterations of the Duels were particularly chatty, but without it, sometimes it feels like a game with a very erratic AI."

,Not Recommended,316010,29586520,Posted: 30 January,all,Gearhead,"What a disappointment.I honestly was excited for this game's release. I thought, ""Ooh, a free Magic: the Gathering game. I hope it's better than the crummy ""Duels of the Planeswalkers"" games."" I downloaded the game on launch day...and was completely let down.I was initially disappointed by the anemic tutorial which (barely) teaches you how to play...But then the AI got CHEAP.The opponent AI in the campaign mode is the single cruelest...thing ever devised. Your opponent will always manage to get their best cards before you can respond. The biggest example is the Jace vs. Alhammarret fight, where if your starting hand doesn't have the TWO Cancels that your deck runs at that point, you WILL lose to a brutal mill deck.This leads to problem number two, the premise decks SUCK. Seriously. Why did Chandra's deck have two Young Pyromancers in a deck with next to no instants or sorceries? Why does Liliana's deck have terrible creatures that can't do anything useful. No reanimator strategies?The only way you can get a decent deck is through custom building one, and the biggest problem shows here...the free-to-play business model. This game rewards players who pay lots of real-world money on packs, giving them large numbers of cards to choose from. By contrast, a completely free player has a strict collection to choose from, and a lot of these cards are unplayable. You can get lucky and pack something like a Liliana in a gift pack (Envy me, ♥♥♥♥♥es.), but most people can't compete with paid players. Compare this to Hearth stone, where new players not only have a chance against more experienced ones, they actually have a shot at winning.So, no. I cannot allow this game a free pass because the concept is good. This is one game that I will never install again."

I like that I can grind for boosters but out of ten packs I open sixty percent of the cards will be white or green.

Play through various campaigns or build custom decks and battle online. The only con (kind of a big one) is that additional cards, other than the ones earned through the campaigns, can only be gotten by trading in coins (or tokens). You earn the tokens by completing various tasks (daily achievements, campaigne completion, tutorial completion or winning versus duels) or more expediently by purchasing them with a credit card. So in that respect, the game is kind of pay-to-win. Good game to brush up on rules and skills. They do tend to keep up with current decks, so its also a nifty tool for trying out the newer cards before buying them."

Haven't spend a dime on the game and due to daily ""quest"" (60-120 coins) you can earn more ingame currency aswell as with wins (30 in PvP, PvAI 5-15 coins).There are somewhat monthly sales where some booster are discounted.

76561198041670863,Not Recommended,316010,29472178,Posted: 24 January,all,SengirPaladin,"UPS1.- Magic Duels is an interesting Game of Magic The Gathering that also provides the excitement of opening new boosters.To get the boosters, you earn coins fulfilling part of the story of the Multiverse of Magic, from the Magic Origins expansion and so on.I really like how the game is presented, although there are several important differences between this game rules of deck building of the paper card game.2.- Except for the basic lands, you can only have 4 cards in the deck with the same name if they are Commons; 3 cards if they are Uncommons; 2 if they are Rares; and 1 if it is Mythic Rare. In the proper card game you may have 4 cards of the same name in the same deck.3.- The good thing about purchasing boosters is that you will get, at most, those many cards, so you can manage to get a collection complete if you purchase enough boosters. One booster is 150 coins. You will not get too many copies of a card and you will not get to use them. From Time to Time, there are boosters ""on sale"". So dsaving coins for those moments can be useful. They cost 1000 coins on sale.4.- The way to earn Coins is interesting: Complete the story mode.Then, you have several quests to do while playing games. you get a new quest each day if you have completed the ones you have, so you can play each day to get more coins.You can also play the computer to earn small amounts of coins.If you win online against another human opponent, you get more coins than against the AI; so that encourages facing people online.5.- You are usually paired with people with the same rank you have (Rank is obtained by the games you win minus the games you lose online), so you should face people with the same skill as you have. You can also play against your friends.6.- There are many cards and you can make interesting decks, although not that many. And Tribal decks are not that much supported.DOWNS1.- The bad thing about the game is the VERY HIGH requirements for a card game. It does not require that much 3D acceleration or anything, I can only play this game on my main computer, but not on my laptop. It crashes. It should require less power for this kind of game, from my point of view. Why does it need that much memory? For the AI?2.- This encourages new Deck Building skills, and that is interesting in some way.3.- It is quite slow to obtain the boosters. You have to win coins each day from the quests, you usually have too many quests if you do not play each day. The booster sale is not that often, and it does not promote getting coins more often, because you do not know when you are going to get boosters cheaper.4.- Most of the Times, quests require to play online. But you have to play in a non-optimal way to fulfill those quests.5.- The pair system only pairs you with people in the ""Win - Lose"" ratio, even if they have many cards and you are starting. So it is difficult to balance.You have to WIN to get coins. That does not encourage playing online. Sometimes, you get so many lost games you do not want to keep playing.I believe that, to encourage playing with anyone, you should get coins even when you lose. If you win, you get 30 coins. Then, if you lose, you should get at least 5 coins. That would encourage you to play with other people online, people you do not know.Also, playing with a friend of yours is not encouraged. You do not get any amount of coins for either wining or losing against your friend.I believe that you should get some coins from that, from playing with your friends. Get, at least 5 coins each. And, if you wih another 5, making a total of 10 coins. Then, you should play a game with your friends 30 Times to get a booster if you do not win any game. THIRTY TIMES. Ok, maybe that it seems that it is too much Time to get one booster... But you earn something from just playing your friends, and that encourages you to play the game, and get more friends into the game.6.- There are MANY interesting cards that have not been added to the game and that would make it more fun. Most are equipments. Some of those cards are:Alhammarret's ArchiveArchangel of TithesBrawler's PlateSword of the AnimistVillage MessengerUlvenwald CaptiveFalkenrath GorgerDrana, Liberator of MalakirClash of WillsDemonic PactGoblin PiledriverJace's SanctumManagorger HydraCaptain's ClawsMunda's VanguardEerie InterludeMarkov DreadknightOdric Lunarch MarshalRelentless DeadMaybe they are not the best, but were left out and are interesting to play with.They could replace other cards that are not even fun to play with. Like:Dauntless CatharEmissary of the SleeplessExtricator of SinInquisitor's OxParanoid Parish-BladeSurvive the NightDrownyard ExplorersStitched ManglerCrow of Dark TidingsRancid RatsDevil's PlaygroundScourge WolfClan of the Waxing MoonEquestrial SkillStoic BuilderInvocation of Saint TraftAmong othersTO SUM UPIf you want to keep in touch with Magic and have lots of Time to spare, you can use that Time opening boosters in this gameBut the pace of the game is quite slow and you cannot get your hands on the total combination of cards that you would like to (For instance, with those cards)The game only encourages winning, not enjoying playing the game; and enjoying any game is a must, even more than only winning.But this is only my point of view.Thank you for reading."

Then you need to buy cards in shop. But another big problem coming-- daily limit of coins earning.

For players to be given the cards they want in a satisfactory amount of time without spending money, the starting card pool must be strengthened, and players should be able to recieve boost packs more quickly.

,Recommended,316010,29410504,Posted: 21 January,all,Xanthos,"Very solid game.Pros:- Interface is much more efficient and logical than other DOTP games (seriously though, DOTP 2015 was borderline unplayable because of its awful menu)- Wait times for games are extremely short.- Game does a fairly good job of matching you with equally-skilled players.- Daily ""Quests"" are fun and help you unlock cards- Unlimited deck customization (though the game does restrict the max number of copies of uncommons, rares and mythics; though this does keep certain archetypes from ruining the game it does make a few janky fun decks hard to build)Cons:-The game caps how many cards you can unlock per day. Winning online games will give you 30 ""coins"", and a pack of 6 cards costs 150 coins (meaning this game fits the standard DOTP formula of unlocking one card per win). My issue is the game caps the number of coins you can get per day from wins, so if you've got the flu or something you can't spend the day grinding like you could in previous versions.- Hard to filter the ""card collection"". They just updated the deck creation menu to have an amazing filter, but it hasn't made it to the collection yet.- Chandra, Flamecaller is way too @$*# overpoweredThings I'd like to see:- The ""if you mulligan to six or fewer cards, you get to scry 1 at the start of the game"" rule added to Magic Duels- The ability to talk to people in-game using text. This feature existed in earlier DOTP games; I assume they didn't add it to this game due to trolls in earlier versions, but it's nice to be able to ask questions (it's also kind of rediculous you can't talk to your teammate in two-headed giant; that's sort of the whole point of that game mode)- The ability to pick the art for your basic lands (default is random art from the most recent set, unless you buy full-art lands)- Some of the game formats from earlier games; multiplayer free-for-all is fun, Archenemy from DOTP 2012 was a blast, and DOTP 2014 had a creative sealed variant.- EDH/Commander. Like, seriously, I'd pay $100 to unlock Commander DLC.Anyway, the game is fantastic. Would definitely recommend."

If you like Magic the Gathering this is the best option availible for PC, but if you want the best online TCG than go with Hearthstone. A limited format, new/different formats (think like Standard, Modern, etc), revisiting classic lore stories (how awesome would it be to play through The Brothers War or Weatherlight saga), and more interesting gameplay modes (example: make a Tavern Brawl like game mode using Planechase cards or bring back Archenemy from the earlier Duels games) are areas for obvious improvement.

New players and veterans of Magic the Gathering will find themselves playing match after match of online versus games and storyline games, that are both emmersive and challenging. Magic Duels comes with an in-depth deck building feature, card collecting, weekly quests, and a number of acheivements for players to strive for. Additionally, players earn seasonal rankings that change based on their wins or losses and affect how they are paired up against other players. I would give Magic Duels a solid 8/10 overall ranking. The only minor things that this game didn't have were sideboarding, best 2 of 3 matches, card ""playsets,"" two-headed giant, card trading, and some other small things that seasoned players have come to love and enjoy. However, I would still highly recommend this game to friends because of the fact that it is a free game that seems to be well maintained by developers."

At the lowest ranks you will play against people with multiple mythic rares. Which, I'm all for a challenge but going against decks with hundreds of dollars in them, constantly, just isn't fun. There's only ranked play as well, which is a big turn off. It makes the games seem less fun because it slaps a rank in your face after every game. It also makes the games seem like they matter more. I wanna play to have fun, not to win. But I don't wanna lose every game either. So, they need to work on their ranking system since it is the only play mode you have available if you wanna play against someone solo. Getting into 2-headed giant is buggy half the time, and players lag out or get kicked the other half.TL;DR - Only play this with friends.

It's MTG if you play the tabletop game you'll probably enjoy this, if you don't then you might find it 'weird' as a few of my friends who I've tried to get into it have.  There are a few bugs here and there, but for the most part they are kept to a minimum.  I dislike the fact that patches aren't patched out until the next content patch (4 months roughly).

However, you will need to buy boosters if you want to play online. Of course you can have some ""starter"" cards if you finish the campaigns, but I found frustrating that you get a mediocre deck (that you can't change in campaign mode) to fight another deck that counters yours. Then it goes for luck, if you get the correct cards that fight to beat your opponent. And to get lucky, you need to play several times the same fight, and it gets annoying instead of enjoyable. That's why I don't recommend this one. If you are going to spend money, go for Magic Online or Magic 2013."

So its close to the card game and that's the big draw for this game. The down side is the game itself. This game has a lot of problems. The timer is very annoying. It runs through some parts too fast for you to act and so you miss chances to play. The it for some reason gives huge amounts of time to do things like look at a card, or choose what opponent you want to attack (hint the one your playing against). It can be hard to block when you hae a lot of attackers. The matching system is a joke, and you can get matched up in your first game against some guy who dumped $$$ down on the game. And that brings me to my last part the pay to win. Yes this game, like magic the gathering the card game, is pay to win, but unlike the card game you cant just get the cards you want, you have to open (buy) packs. And with about 2$ a pack 6 cards in a pack and 1000+ cards. This is the definition of a pay to win game. Now to be fair you can earn coins and each set does give you some descent starter cards, so you can get a few OK decks. Just expect to loose to most people unless you pay into the game. You can grind for it, but expect to play a very long time to be even a little competitive.I recommend the game at first. The missions are fun. It uses the magic the gathering cards and rules and even this game couldn't mess that up. I would not play after that much or put money into this, unless you want to put down a lot. The later vs games are not fun unless you put in the money. For a free game I would recommend, if you like MTG the card game."

The Story mode is very well built, wiht interesting duels that change the original dynamic of the game in a fun way.It adds a replay value by having daily quests as well as a ranking ladder to compete on, although they don't seem to go anywhere but up.One problem is that if you have too many cards, the visual clutter is unbearable and makes the game nearly unplayble, ebcause you'll be spending minutes each turn trying to snipe your cards in the table.Another issue are the constant crashes, which are always a nuissance.Nonetheless, it's a very fun game if you already liked the Magic The Gathering card game.

If you are new or returning to magic after a break, this is perfect though.This being more suitable for beginners is absolutely not a bad thing, a beginner would be completely lost using Magic Online, they should absolutely play magic duels for many hours before trying magic online in my opinion.5/5 for new or returning players, 1/5 for people who has played some to a lot of magic recently and know all the rules and want to play different modes similar to paper magic (you should just go to Magic Online or to your local game store)"

MAGIC DUELS is literally just a clone of the plainswalker series, with none of the features we requested.ATTENTION DEVELOPER:i.e. and i quote.1. fewer animations (options for turning off all [ALL{liter♥♥♥♥inally ALL!}] animations).2. longer window to stop the timer, a timer that stay stopped and does not start again after you play a card. with added function to skip the stop timer phase!!3. 100% manual mana tapping OPTION.4. 0% gameplay, and rule bugs.5. more cards. or better yet ONE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME WHERE ALL CARDS ARE ADDED! (p.s. magic online has since attempted to do this exact thing.)anyway if you can tolerate the SAME ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T we have been exposed to as MTG fans go ahead and play MAGIC DUELS because it is a decent game. however if you want the most bug free version of the game then play duels of the plainswalkers 2013. it is the most bug free of every single money grubbing piece of living♥♥♥♥♥♥game these people made.sorry if i have offended you, this is all meant to be constructive feedback. HOWEVER AS YOU CAN SEE I AM A LITTLE BIT ABSO♥♥♥♥INGLUTELY DISSAPOINTED WITH WIZARDS OF THE COAST!will i buy another MGT game after trying magic 2014. SNOWBALLS CHANCE IN HELL!THEY STILL HAVE NOT FIXED BASIC BUGS WITH THE PROGRAM! THEY ♥♥♥♥ING REPRODUCE THE SAME PIECE OF♥♥♥♥♥♥SOFTWARE EVERY YEAR WITH THE SAME ERRORS AND TRY TO MAKE MONEY WITH IT.all that said go ahead and play magic duels as you will anyway, for its free to play grind to win content."

,Recommended,316010,29586903,Posted: 30 January,all,shadowkyo1,very enjoyable cant stop playing. I play magic the card game and to be able to play this is just as much fun for me. the only complaint I have is that occasionally the game will freeze in the middle of a match causing a loss.

Not enough land or too much land. Played quite a few games now...winning or losing is arbitrary. It feels like the game has already decided whether youre going to win or lose.
