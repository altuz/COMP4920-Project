76561197988012862,Recommended,316080,17377499,"Posted: 3 August, 2015",all,mendel,"First impression:It's a Sokoban-style puzzle game with a companion cube and lasers.And yeah, we've seen lots of box pushing games, and laser puzzle games, but none where you needed to pack up your box at the end (it's not enough to just reach the exit), and none that had co-op play (you can switch between up to 4 characters if you play alone), and of course this one also has gamepad support.You get 4 different box pushers: the first one, the postman, can just pick the parcel up and set it down. The next one is magentic and can pull it (but not push), and the third one can only use switches that can block and unblock pathways and those robots with lasers. I haven't gotten to the fourth one yet.So these are different skills, and since the objective is not only to get the box where it needs to go, but all of these toons as well, it can get a little hairy. It is a lot of fun to play together, because you're continuously helping each other out. Most levels have at least two characters, those that have only one are usually quick.The mechanics are simple, yet the last level we played took us half an hour - we think we did half of the levels, but the game says we're 25% done.Push boxes with a friend! I'm sold. Parcel turned out to be a very accessible, very enjoyable brain twister."

There were no videos or reviews up for many hours, and this game seemed perhaps a little steep.. and I've been burned on some of these Indie puzzle games already.  But I took the leap anyhow...And I am happy that I did.This game is not just great, it is absolutely brilliant.  And a ton of fun to play as well!Your job is to get past laser beams using the well thought out level designs with your single block in hand.  Along the route from where you start to where you must get to, you'll need to use your block by placing, pulling, or pushing it to block laser beams that obstruct you.  Death is not possible in this game, it simply won't allow you to step into places you can't go.  Sounds simple.  But as the levels quickly get more cleverly designed, you'll need to actually use your brain power for something besides a just a goop of grey matter sitting idle between your ears.The brilliance in the game mechanics, well designed levels, fluid controls, and nice graphics makes for one of the most satisfying and fun puzzle games that I have played in years.Over 120 puzzles already in early access?  And the ability to create your own, share them, and play other players levels as well?  OMG.  Add in the ability to play local co-op on a single computer as I did in the video with my son, and you have yourself a little Indie gem here.  This game is the reason I take chances on ""Indie"" games.  This game is easily one of the best puzzles games I have ever played.  ...Enough said.Is it worth your $10 USD?  ...If you really need my answer after reading this far, you might wanna get better at ""thinking"" if you do buy this game.  You'll need to increase your thinking power if you have to ask me that after reading this review this far or watching my video!  :-)To the developers who are Polar Bunny Ltd:  Thank you much for this masterpiece of a game!  I love it and look forward to seeing this game as it develops further and any future games you guys design.  Fantastic job, and well done!"

Its great to see indie developers like this put out a solid product that really captures the passion they put into it. This is the kind of game that really shines with steam broadcasting too, the minor delay not being an obstacle in allowing you and a friend to work together in analyzing and deconstructing each puzzle and having a rewarding time doing it.I hope Polar Bunny's passion is rewarded with this but I can see this game falling through the cracks for a lot of people.

Difficulty curve is really good too, from easy puzzles to mindbreaking ones. The game is also lenient by not forcing you to solve everything to move on (and even beat it) so you can have fun at your own pace and 100% it in whatever order."

A great thing about this game is that it provides controller support, so if you have multiple controllers and friends to play with, you can play this game with multiple people (up to 4).The number of people that can play is based on the level, but once you unlock the third character, most levels are usually at least 3 players.Now in terms of enjoyment in the game, it all boils down to this.  Do you enjoy challenging puzzle games?  Do your friends like puzzle games?  Do you enjoy your friends?  Regardless of the answer for the last question, this game is for you, as it can be used as a great griefing engine if you wanna trap them in a 1x1 square surrounded on all sides by laser spiders.Overall, I highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a fun multiplayer puzzle game at a great price. 10/10"

Price is cheap too so i really do think this is a good addition to the game library for puzzle game players who want a more casual experience. At this time i have nearly completed all levels on first 3 areas + extra areas so that makes the average difficulty 'mediocre' or even somewhat easy.
,Recommended,316080,15390889,"Posted: 15 April, 2015",all,Bomadeno,"Some bits of this game are clearly early access - the menus, the editor, and there are a few oddities. Despite this - as long as there are no major regressions - I can already recommend this. Why? Because the characters really come together.Like your standard puzzle game, each character has one simple mechanic that is pushed to the limit by each puzzle. However, this game has 4 (or so) of these characters. Individually, with the various laser set-pieces, they can be part of  pretty darn challenging puzzles. Combined, they can be made into extremely hard puzzles... with extremely satisfying solutions. Several of the built in puzzles have brilliant ""aha"" moments, which is key to a good puzzle game.The gameplay is rock solid - not a single gameplay glitch. There are a few visual bugs and grammar issues - and as mentioned before, the menus still feel shaky. The worst part of the menus is that a whole set of ""special place"" levels are hidden behind an extremely unobtrusive button. A ""switch space"", taking inspiration from Super Meat Boy's light/dark modes would work better, I think.I've played through a large number of puzzles (I am pleasantly stuck on some of them), yet there are still a lot more to go. I've got 5 hours on the clock with maybe half the puzzles solved.While the editor is clearly unfinished, and filled with usability issues and weird behavior, it ""does the job"". I wouldn't want to design a level's visuals in it, but hammering out the logic is easy enough and lets you build your own mind bending puzzles, if you feel inspired. (I was)The sound effects, visuals and animations are nice. Some of the built in levels look bleached out from overlighting, beyond the pleasant cacphony of neon, but generally everything is both functional and pleasant to look at. There are a couple of visual problems in levels which make them unnecessarily hard to solve, I want to see those fixed before I'd recommend this without the early access tag (unlit squares and visually obstructed squares). The music is nothing to write home about, but it's not offensive and you can mute it.I bought it for full price, and I'm extremely happy with it. I look forward to solving more, and to horrible people creating insanely hard community levels.Disclosure: I know the company behind Parcel personally. Still, I wouldn't sacrifice impartiality for any of them. ^_^"

Stages are usually small, but don't be fooled by the look of them, many will require an astonishing amount of moves to beat.

I have a mid-level PC but the rest of the game runs perfectly smoothly.Also, if you restart a level that you have smashed blocks in - the blocks spawn back but only as black blocks, rather than with the textures they originally had.All in all despite these minor issues, I fully enjoyed the challenge this game provided and would easily recommend this."

76561198047518514,Recommended,316080,34778444,Posted: 6 September,all,halo19248,"I'm always looking for good puzzle games and I can tell you Parcel is a true gem, a very clever logic puzzle that is much more intriguing than it looks at first sight. It also goes way beyond just being a ""Sokoban clone"" because the game world contains laser barriers, robots, remote-controlled interlocked obstacles, and you control several characters with unique abilities who are gradually added to the game as you progress through the levels (so far I've encountered the parcel picker, magnet, teleporter, jumper, and remote controller; UPDATE: the final addition is the hammer guy who can remove wall pieces, which adds yet another layer of complexity). The point of each level is to get your characters (and the parcel) to their destination spots, for which they have to interact and cooperate to clear paths and block (or sometimes destroy) enemies. Not every puzzle features all characters; you will mostly have three to five; sometimes you'll get two or more of the same kind (four magnets, two teleporters, etc).The gamelogic and the rules (who does what/who moves in which way) are well thought out, consistent, and at the same time simple and easily learned. The puzzles, however, are intricate and quite a few of them will thoroughly test your brain power, and that makes this game awesome: Minutes to learn, hours to master.I recommend playing this game without looking up the solutions. Try hard and have patience - it's much more rewarding if you solve everything on your own.UPDATE:Yesterday I reached Level 125 and then the credits rolled. I had a total blast with this game! The level design is simply outstanding. I enjoyed almost every level despite the high difficulty. I solved all the puzzles and never looked for help, and so it took me ages, certainly more than my logged time (I'm not always online); probably more than 60 hours total.The game has a level editor and user levels too, so there may be more to discover.I highly recommend this especially to the patient puzzle fan who likes complex, pure logic puzzles. There is no timing, dexterity or controller skill needed at all, as e.g. inStealth B_astard. You make your moves slowly and (usually) cannot die by making wrong ones (you cannot step into lasers etc). However, you can make wrong moves in regards to finding the solution, and trap yourself in a dead-end, and then you'll have to restart  - which happens a lot! Cracking the toughest puzzles requires an incredible amount of trial-and-error, backtracking, and patience. And brain cells!"

,Not Recommended,316080,19461322,"Posted: 3 December, 2015",all,ChaosUnown,"Parcel is... barely on par. Great graphics, cool characters, neat concept & gimmicks, but the gameplay falls very short. My main complaint about this game is how easy it is to get WAY off track when solving a puzzle. Now keep in mind, you are able to make a ""save state"" and reload with the backspace key to where you left off if you make a mistake, but the questionable level design allows the player to make a lengthy set of moves, only for it to fail completely when they realize one wrong action completely ruined their meticulous strategy, and they have to start from the beginning anyway. It's not a good feeling, and it severely demotivates the player from wanting to continue. One thing I would suggest instead of having this faulty save state option is to simply take back one move every time the player hits the backspace key (or alternatively press and hold backspace to rewind the play field back to where you want it); that alone could save a ton of headaches and frustration.I still enjoy the core concept this game brought. I like the idea of having all of these characters each with unique abilities that the others don't have, I just wish there was more flexibility with the solutions. In a good puzzle game like Portal 2 there are more often then not multiple solutions and/or routes to approaching a solution. But for this game you are expected to make a very specific and meticulous set of moves from start to finish that would not be too far off from trying to split an atom. I've always hated puzzle games that go this route, and it is NOT good game design.The ending is also complete nothingness, by the way. All that happens is that you head into a poorly designed room and destroy what I believe was supposed to be the ""boss,"" but it was just one of the two random enemies that you've already seen placed throughout the main levels. The boss couldn't even get his own unique character model, which is extremely lazy. What's also lazy is that this final level doesn't even utilize all 6 heroes. All you use is Block and Magna to crush a few random enemies, and then do the exact same thing to the ""boss."" And after that the screen goes black and plays the credits. I've seen lazy endings before, but this is right on par with Super Pitfall where after you land on a random platform the screen flickers to black and shows just a paragraph of plain white text. Some of these daunting levels took me hours to complete and when this is the payoff I get for the ending then I am convinced that my time has been wasted.Overall barely an okay game, though it is ambitious for what it tried to do. I cannot recommend a puzzle game that does not allow for some amount of experimentation and creativity."

The game feels very stable and has a variety of challenging puzzles. It works great with my XBox 360 Controller too, its easier than the keyboard. Its worth the full price."
