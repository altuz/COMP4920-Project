76561198004553140,Recommended,316140,11894088,"Posted: 28 August, 2014",all,Moral Wiz,"Stop!This game has nothing to do with the horror/semi-action series F.E.A.R., it's an adaptation of an old Steve Jackson book. Got that?! Everyone ok with that? Good, moving on. This game is awesome!Steve Jackson's CYOA books have a strong positive reputation, so I won't focus this on the base material. I'll focus my commentry on the adaptation. Tin Man Games have stayed faithful to the original material, focusing on using the format of the VN to enhance the experience. Sound and music stings, strong colour illustrations, the whole adventure has a nice oldschool sense of fun, and there's a lot of new content here. They've done a lot more than just transcribe the book.My two main notes to caution people: this is an old school Choose Your Own Adventure book. Tin Man have done a good job of enabling replays and turning back to a prior page is very simple, but inspite of this, you're still going to want to play through things a few times to really understand how to tackle things.Also, the comedy on occasion is a little blatant. I laughed at the fact that our 'civilian clothes' are a Clark Kent hat and glasses.... over our superhero costume. ;) Still, the compulsary random names is something that might irritate people.However, Appointment with FEAR was still a ton of fun. I'm now replaying it, come in and join me! Titan City needs its defenders"

As soon as I saw this on Steam, I threw money at it. Was I disappointed? Yes.The graphics are really nice, well-done comic style that really fits the theme of the game. The name generator and much of the text is anywhere between amusing and downright hilarious. Gameplay is set over the course of several days, giving you a chance to stop (or ignore) different crimes, explore different locations, and make a lot of decisions about where to go next.So what's the problem?It is too faithful to the unforgiving nature of the original books - specifically, those books where you had to collect certain items ('do you have a <statue, etc>?') and / or paragraph numbers to go with them, meaning that if you took one misstep, you would end up failing. The better amongst the original gamebooks didn't use that system, and gave you more chance of being able to complete it without having to follow an absolute sequence. Yes, there is a rewind feature ... but that made it feel a bit more hopeless to me. You have to pick the exact right way through, otherwise, you get to sit through that same damnable ending of the bad guys win, city is destroyed, you fail. Along the way, you will find lots of clues that you're supposed to match to various locations; I've played through maybe 3 or 4 times, and managed to match one or two clues, total. Frustrating. I keep thinking, yeah, I want to beat this ... but every time I go back to play, I think about how frustrating it is, knowing that if I don't follow that golden path, none of my choices are going to mean anything, and I am going to see that same ending again. Also, stopping crimes / capturing bad guys nets you Hero Points (for use with the in-game collectible card system) ... if you fail the adventure, said points are generally wiped out by the loss you take for failing the main objective.Maybe I was more flexible as a kid, and the books were harder than I remember, but I can only think of one out of the dozens I played through that gave me anything like this much trouble (Starship Traveller)tl;dr: might be worth it for the nostalgia and the fun of the first couple of playthroughs, but can get very frustrating, and feel very shallow."
76561198038132122,Recommended,316140,32654089,Posted: 22 June,all,ForestWolf,"Rating: mediocre (5/10)IntroductionAppointment with FEAR is a stylish comic adventure, where you pick the hero you want to be and choose which crimes to fight in the city. You progress in the game automatically, but you have some choice that will have impact on further progress and results in the game.Gameplay & Story: 4/10The story is a simple comic book one - you are the hero of the city that has to save it from the villains. At the start of the game you get to know, that you have 3 days to get enough clues about the big bad guys called FEAR and save the city. The clues you gather through investigating crimes, fighting smaller bad guys and using your super powers to get something more or less special. Some quests you encounter are not connected to the main story and are there just to keep you busy, but since you lose time to find the clues for the big thing, it means the smaller quests are still somewhat related to the main story. The dialogs are nicely written, some are funny, others are more typical for comis books but they all feel well integrated.Combat & Challenge : 3/10You fight the villains in this game by simply selecting which attack to use in a fight. There are always 3 choice and they have different hit chances and do different damage to your opponent. Basically, you just press on one and hope to hit, so far I was never even close to lose a fight, so it seems they are made the way you always win. The game does not feel challenging at all, its more for casual fun gameplay.Graphic & Interface : 6/10The graphic has a nice style and feels absolutely comic-like which is the goal of the game. Surely fans of older comic magazines will enjoy playing with this graphic. There are not many visual effects, but the existing ones fit the game nicely. The interface is simple but again fitting the game style.Progress & Mini-Games : 6/10The progress is rather quick, especially if you are a quick reader. Most of the game you only read what is happening in the city and rarely choose which action to pick next. There are no mini-games in Appointment with FEAR, so after few playthroughs the game feels a bit repetative since the choices remain the same and are not reandomised. Overall the progress is fine though, since the dialogs and texts are not bad and quite often you will lauph or at least smile a bit.Audio & Immersion : 7/10The music is pretty cool electronic and definetely serves the comic game with science plays a big role. The sound feedback in fighting and small animations was fitting the game really well and the stay in menus or the game was made enjoyable by the fine tracks playing in the background.Side-NotesThis game is single player only.This game contains steam achievements.This game has steam trading cards.This game offers some replayability, since you can try out multiple hero powers and check different quests and crimes in the city.SummaryAppointment with FEAR is a nice comic-style adventure, which will offer you some fun moments and replayability. Players enjoying being a hero with super powers in a pick your adventure games, will definetely have some fun with this title. Most other players will enjoy few hours of gameplay, but most likely will figure out how to save the city once and after that, the game is quite done.I hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying this game. Rate and leave a comment if you enjoyed reading it.~ForestWolf"

Different missions are given, however, only one path won't end in game over. Short and not very funny dialogue. Didn't really relate to my character (or any character), which is sad because that's what I look for when I'm customizing my own character.  The art is good and so is the music, but not worth $10 or the time I spent trying to guess that perfect sequence of events that the game wanted me to follow so that I could end the game."

I've always been a fan of choose your own adventure stories, and thought that this gameplay would add another dimension to that formula.This ended up being something else altogether though. While the freedom to do as you wish is present, the punishment/reward system feels out of whack. My success seemed determined on my finding a specific set of clues, which would see me following a very specific direction in my story. Every other attempt I made, regardless of whether I saved the city and the civilians around me in each mini-encounter, the game would end part way through with everyone dying in a bomb blast.I like the presentation and think the adaptation into a video game worked, just that the game book at the core that drags the experience down. I'm not sure if it's just this game book i have an issue with, or wheter it would extend to the whole platform/genre, but I'm not eager to try any others after having played this one. Whatever sense of exploration I wanted to feel was bogged down by a heavy sense of tediousness."

I was looking for a casual, fun, somewhat engaging superhero opus, what I got was a super silly game that wouldn't even let me create the name of my character. I had to page through randomly generated hero names until I found one that wasn't nonsense and just plain stupid. I could have done better using an on-line name randomizer. Also I guessing the Steve Jackson who wrote this is not the same guy behind Steve Jackson Games, the level of quality just isn't there. The combat is ok for what it is, but what the heck is generating the hit locations of the moves? Hitting the guy in the right toe or left nostril is, again, just silly and has no effect on the game what so ever. I wasn't expecting DC on-line from a $5 game, but then again DC on-line is free to play so I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn't this."

,Recommended,316140,11881232,"Posted: 26 August, 2014",all,shoggofu,"I played this for roughly two hours and played through to the end twice. Unfortunately I ran into a few problems during my second play-through, but I still really like this game.- You can't stop every crime, catch every villain or save everyone, some choices are very amusing while others are tragic- As well as subduing run of the mill villains you need to investigate and gather clues in an attempt foil a plot to assassinate the president and save the worldhttp://youtu.be/qf3waAR44EYhttp://youtu.be/RuV47H0cpWEAppointment with F.E.A.R. - part 1 (first impressions review)So in my first play through I was 'The Streaker'. you are given the choice of randomly generated names and I thought this one was perfect! You also have the choice of four different powers, I chose strength and flight. Although there were active alerts on my 'crime-watch' I took my time leaving my apartment on my first day to finish my coffee and make sure that my suit was looking nice. I decided that make the most amusing choices possible during this play-through whether or not that would make me good hero or not.-----The game spans three days and each day you set out to work. You of course have a day job as a reporter and your alter-ego is quite mild mannered. You're always late to work and your boss is constantly yelling at you.-----Every time you walk down the street, take the train to work etc. you always run into an incidents such as a crime in progress in citizens in dire need of assistance. You have series of choices of what to investigate at each location. For example the commotion of beeping cars in the street where you will notice a car chase or ignore the beeping and instead purchase a newspaper for news or clues about crimes. At the same time your crime-watch usually alerts you to something else. You have to choose what to investigate or deal with, you have no choice but to allow some crimes and incidents to go happen in order to stop others.-----If it is a villain you engage you will be put into combat with them. You have a limited amount of stamina points which basically function as health. You exchange attacks with the villain until one of you is defeated. When it is your turn you have the choice of three attacks each does consecutively more damage and is more likely to fail. So there's a little bit of strategy to combat i.e. take most of their stamina with a strong attack then finish them off easily with a weak attack. I never lost a battle. But I think that was because I always chose strength as my power and so had a lot of stamina.-----If you deal with an incident you need to make the right choices in order to save the victims. If you hesitate or make the wrong choice you can fail to save everyone. For example I investigated a giant shark that was terrorizing swimmers at a beach. You are actually given the choice to tell swimmers that it's not a shark but just a school of bluefish, which I'm sure wouldn't have turned out well if I'd tried that. Instead I thought I did the right thing by making sure that everyone got out of the water instead of flying towards the shark. However a boy was caught and horrifically eaten by the shark. My hero basically slunk away in shame.-----Also after defeating villains in combat you usually have the option to allow them to go free instead of handing them in to the authorities. Sometimes you do this in exchange for clues. It was amusing to allow the chainsaw wielding Bronski free who immediately starts his chainsaw, laughs maniacally and runs off the down the street waving his chainsaw around. But when I defeated the assassin I decided to allow him to go free, unfortunately as soon as I did that he took his gun and shot the president, whoops! I felt pretty bad about that.-----Some incidents cannot be stopped without the right clues. You cannot prevent the president's death or know the location of F.E.A.R.'s meeting which you instructed that you must find at the start of the game. I basically failed the game both times I played it through. Although I tried to play seriously during the second play-through and I actually found the clues I needed. For some reason towards the end they disappeared from list of clues. I'm not sure what happened. So the last half an hour or so I was basically playing towards an inevitable failure which was disappointing.-----The game is short but it has re-playability value. For one to be able to achieve a positive ending if you failed like I did. Some of the things were the same on the second play-through. But in a lot of cases you make different choices for an alternate experience.-----I think the game looks quite good. It has some very nice artwork and interesting characters. There is minimal animation, sometimes panels shake and text in combat such as 'KA-THUUUUUUNK!' have some colorful special effects.-----You can make some very silly choices and the costume of my character's alter ego consisted of the exact same caped tights clad action hero only donning a large pair of spectacles and a fedora. So initially the game seemed like it would be pretty amusing, it was sometimes even later. But it wasn't really lighthearted as I first expected, with people dying bloody deaths and so on.-----The game also rawards you with trading cards. Not steam trading cards. Your collection only seems to exist with the game itself. You gain a random trading card at the end of events such as the defeat of a villain in combat. You can also expend luck points that you accumulate to raise your chances of finding rare cards. You would need to play through the game several times in order to collect all the cards.It was a bit depressing that I failed to save the president and the world on my second play-through. I think something may have gone wrong somewhere with the game somewhere to erase my clues. Bar that I enjoyed this game and I think it's quite good. It was worth waiting a few extra hours for it to become available this morning, instead of playing something else.Clickherefor my YouTube gaming channel"

There is essentially only 1 path to the good ending while 1 wrong option can essentially lead to every game over. That being said, this in my opinion is a deadly sin for a visual novel to do.The character designs ugly to meh at best, name generator makes incredibly idiotic names, and essentially there's nobody to care for in the game besides your cliche of a hero, and even then there isn't much to care for. The only comedic thing is the hero dons a effective disguise by wearing a fedora and glasses. Everything else is incredibly lifeless and dull.We throw in some public domain sound effects, maybe 1-2 songs you'll be listening to constantly...the game is just shallow and has nothing to offer.You should instead consider buying a different indie game like Undertale or just try to find any other visual novel.1/10"

It's inconsistent and create frustrations, especially when there's several big choices and the game didn't see fit to give you a checkpoint for a while.Oh, and some very strange inconsistency, when it comes to the ''damages''. 20/20 Stamina, villain hurts you for 2 damage, 12/20 Stamina... what ?...and I just found another rather severe problem with the game. While in the game, each time you go to the menu, for whatever reason, it RESET the ''scene'' ! Best case : You go back a few pages. Worst case : While in a fight, it will COMPLETELY reset the villain's health to full, but not yours !After finding more and more problems with this game, and even though there's something good in there, the many-many faults are just too frustrating and create a LOT of tedium for no good reason.This should *not* be ever bought at full price."
