(Definitely pick it up if you have kids that will play it!)"

There are issues with the steam controller and with it randomly crashing, and it doesn't look like disney is doing anything about it. If you're planing on playing this through steam link/streaming with controllers I'd wait until these are resolved. Its a shame because its hard to find multiplayer co-op games suitable for 5  year olds (other than lego).Regarding the game itself, I've only managed to play about 45 mins. Its crashed twice on start up (restarting steam seems to fix that) and 3 times during gameplay. Of what we did play, its was simple, fun, the levels are short and its easy enough for young kids to pick up."

So far, I like the game, but the most problematic aspect is the lack of controls-modification. There seems to be no way to keybind anything if you are PC user, so it takes a bit of practice to get muscle memory in the use of the uncomfortable arrow keys  for movement.Other than the initial awkwardness, the game is cute and fun.  Game runs smoothly and is easy to pick up. Has a collectable aspect many people like me will like, where you can buy new maps, new costumes, etc."

Not as good as Disney Infinity but any Disney fan should own this. Great fun especially with friends (its Coop)

,Recommended,316260,27060341,"Posted: 23 November, 2016",all,Cecilia,"A great couch co-op game to play with your kid or significant other - it's not too hard or complex that casual gamers won't be able to keep up, but it isn't too simple that you'll get bored. Visuals are great for a 5-year old game. Get it especially if it's on sale.The only downside is that the framerate is locked to 30fps - it's not a dealbreaker for me but I understand people who cannot tolerate it.Also, there are other people that have had crashes with the game so it's something to look out for. Thank god we have steam refunds now, right?"

,Recommended,316260,23947355,"Posted: 30 June, 2016",all,Gamer Mom,Love this game! Been playing non stop for the last few days. It's nothing serious nor does it require much thought which is I guess part of it's charm. Just a cute little game to zone out with. Disney fans like myself will appreciate the beautiful details in the movie based levels and playing as their favorite characters (can't wait until I unlock Stitch costume)! Would recommend :)

,Recommended,316260,13264748,"Posted: 7 December, 2014",all,Necroscourge,"A strange arcade style puzzle brawler where you and three buddies cosplay as various disney and pizar characters from a handful of franchises. Sadly, ""Universe"" lacks many other franchises characters.EDIT: Stars guage power level, and they apperently persist and stay with ther costume. I consider that an honest mistake because it's certainly not explained.Gameplay is a brain-numbing objective based brawler where you do what the game tells you and beat up anything that gets in your way. Enemies are actually fairly sophisticated. They infight, they build traps, they steal objective objects and run away with them; This makes having a lot of enemies on screen extremely entertaining rather than irritating like other titles. Even though you won't see them the first time, there are models for every type of unit for every theme. Playing with a lot of friends will thus probably bring out the hardest enemies in the highest quantity.Every area is composed of three stages. The third has a boss. There are three areas to a theme. You unlock costumes by completing each area, with many costumes being unlocked by simply replaying levels.After awhile you start to get bored of the uniform design of the levels. While every level tries to introduce new mechanics some of them begin to get more intricate. I call it a puzzle brawler because that's what it is, you lack alot of mobility other such games have. There are jump puzzles, and they tend to be very irritating as some manuevers the game expects you to do often have a high chance of making you respawn. Even with a few deaths the game rarely gave me any better than bronze while solo.Get it cheap, especially if you have friends that enjoy drinking. Buy a few packs of beer and drink every time you respawn, that'll make the game far more entertaining. The lack of real story and limited selection of costumes can be a drag, and the gameplay tries to be inventive but the core player abilities are just dull."

I actually go this for my daughter (she is 7) & was surprised at how entertaining it was.  We've played all the levels multiple times to get the different costumes & to upgrade our weapons to see what we would get next to slap around the baddies.  This is a great game to play with your kids, challanging enough to get you thinking yet easy to pick up & learn.  Definitely a wishlist item for any parent with young kids, hours of fun."
