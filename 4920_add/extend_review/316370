,Not Recommended,316370,18901982,"Posted: 5 November, 2015",all,GretelMK2,"After researching for weeks for a game I think I would really like I get to this.  I played for an hour and requested a refund.  The tutorial island is terrible, the 'helpful' messages get in the way of your view, all inventories are unintuitive, what is clickable on the screen is impossible to tell without mousing over it.The very first quest had improper info.  Talk to the quest giver then open a door elsewhere.  Get to the door, says talk to the quest giver.  Go to quest giver, says open the door.  Have to Google to find out there was a key in a box that I didn't click on.  No need to talk to quest giver.  This is the opening tutorial.  If these mistakes are here, who knows what else is wrong.On the opening island there is only 1 enemy.  So far the game seemed to be trying to explain how things work, but no tutorial for fighting.  So I figure out how to draw my weapon and begin fighting...which involves holding down left click on the enemy.  Seems fine, just like Diablo.  Figure I will get more moves later.  Nope, not fine.  Enemy doesn't die.  It's not like I have any skill I can use here, all I can do is melee at point blank range.  Enemy kills me with 2/3rds of it's life.  I respawn and attack again (Happily enemy doesn't go back to full HP).  2 more deaths and 5 mins later and it's dead.Perhaps it had something to do with the Cursed Weapon I was holding.  I found this weapon lying around, looked better than mine so I equiped it.  It's the tutorial, so what could go wrong?  Totally cursed.  Can't un-equip.  I couldn't even figure out why I couldn't un-equip until I saw a small icon in the top right of my screen saying I was holding a cursed item.  It should have said something across my screen when I tried to switch it out.Then looting is terrible.  Want to mine?  No animation.  Just opens up a window with some ore.  EVERYTHING is like this.  Can't even shift click to put it in your inventory.  Drag and drop.  Or click a picture of a hand to get it all at once.Map is fairly bad as well.  It's huge, as advertised, but ugly and hard to understand.  For instance, I wanted to un-curse my weapon.  I had to look up what a Shrine looked like on the map since it's not listed under the rest of the large icons that signify areas of importance.  Saw this complained about in another thread since I had to look this up to.  Got to the Shrine that would supposedly uncurse my weapon, but I saw no option to do so.  Accidently fell in the water next to it and died.  Submitted a request for a refund.I don't doubt that it gets better as I go, but I'm not going to waste time here.  I found Dwarf Fortress to have a nicer UI."

I'm loving this game! It reminds me a lot of Gothic (my favorite game) or Risen. Don't expect cutting edge graphics or animations.  The focus of the game is on story and exploration. The world is packed with stuff to interact with and to find and using your map is essential.  Yes, you can make bookmarks on the map.  The voice acting is great. Combat is OK; don't expect Grim Dawn style action combat. You don't actively block or dodge; combat is stat dependent. It can be a bit confusing getting started, just like Gothic was, but if you explore, everything is explained pretty well.  I also recommed watching the 3 tutorial vids and reading the manual.  Quests unlock areas of the game, so if you can't do somethng or somethng is blocked/locked, there's a reason. You can go do something else and things will work themselves out. There's minimal ""hand-holding"" in the game, ala Gothic. Quest givers don't have ! over their heads; you have to talk to people. And there's no ""Ta-Da"" when you complete a quest.  You have to figure that out yourself.  Did a merchant send you out to find a camp that was overrun by enemies and to recover a lost message?  Well, when you come on a bunch of ruined wagons and dead people, and you pick a message up off the ground, you can assume you solved the quest.  I can see spending very many hours in this game. The game really simulates exploring a new land pretty well. You have to annotate your map, you have to find stuff yourself and you have to figure out your route and your methods of accomplishing goals. To me, that's real immersion. The game is running well on my machine.   I've found only one annoying glitch, but Iggy is working on that and it didn't stop my progress in the game.  What game doesn't have a few glitches, at first?   If this is the type of game you like, I recommend this game to you."

,Recommended,316370,16773057,"Posted: 28 June, 2015",all,GORE,"Wave of Darkness was something  I wasn't expecting. I love all types of RPG games and Wave of Darkness is another one to add to the list.To me it came across of Diablo 2 mix with Sacred 2.  For an early access title, there is plenty of game contents to keep you going for hours. At the time of writing this, I only put in almost 5 hours but had no major game crashes or game breaking bugs to warrant any reason to stop playing the game.  With my GTX 960 I can run the game on max with some minor frame drop every now and then.The combat can be a bit chunky but overall not to bad. The spell creating in great. After you created your spell, each time you cast it, it levels as well. There not to much in the way of skills as I can see yet but you do get attribute points in both character leveling and skills leaving. There are fast travel way points with in most locations.  There are some areas in the game that look like it can be easily swim across but don't temp this, as your character can't swim and will die.The Good : -* Loot, loot and more loot* Plenty of Bag space on your character* Spell Creation - Create your own spell and level them* Open WorldThe Bad : -* Quests need to be easier to Identified in both receiving and handing in.* Combat can be chunky* Way to many keys* Can't SwimThe Neutral : -* Curse itemsOverall a great game but can be a heavy in the pocket for the cost for early access game.7/10 for me."
,Not Recommended,316370,18919842,"Posted: 6 November, 2015",all,Eilibex,"I want to like this game. I do. But it dies in a lot of aspects.Its basically the same game weve all played, but does it worse in a lot of ways. Youd probably enjoy your time more if you just up and bought Skyrim or Diablo or something.""Can be explored in any way and whenever you want"" Funny then what are these hedgehog walls (which any functional being would have no issue climbing over or around) doing here? They arent any better than the invisible walls the game page says this game doesnt have. Oh yeah, and the cunning lack of invisible walls by using deadly deep water instead.""Allows you to combine and experiment with different character classes"" Yeah, maybe when you get a fair distance into the game. But you might as well just resign yourself to Melee for the time being, because you dont have a choice when you start up the game, only difference is that melee specced stats are more useful at the start than magery specced ones.Thats just the start of the blatant flaws this game has, not to mention it actually doesnt look as good as the screenshots above, even on max settings. Its like playing NWN again, but far less functional.Not worth the price, and not worth what i paid for it when it was on special. Maybe later if they fix some massive issues, but at the moment, steer elsewhere.This game claims that its for the Hardcore Oldschool RPG fans. And im insulted, as i am one of them.------Because apparently two features they used ambiguously wasnt enough, heres some more of my experiences:Tutorial is a joke, it barely tells you where to go. You are quite frequently expected to have any clue when the quest objectives progressed, and at the end of the Tutorial when it tells you to 'find your own road' to the first city, it fails to mention that there isnt one. Going right results in a blocked road and broken bridge. Up leads to water which will apparently dissolve you since youre water soluable (What? seriously?), Down does the same. And left leads you to a peninsula with loot on it. Guess how long it took for me to realise ""Skip tutorial"" was what i was apparently meant to do. (i think so, anyway. The quest straight up vanished from my quest log)Looting is slow and overwhelming, literally turning the first few minutes outside the tutorial onward into an inventory management game.The combat is simple, (and while very reminicent to other games of its type), is incredibly unimaginative. Bash/Cast/Buff/Summon/Etc. Nothing new, nothing special.The map claims to be huge, and by scale it is, but literally only because your means of transport is a jog. The map itself is pretty average in size.The ground itself has poor hitboxes and a wrong step when exploring could put you into a certain death situation due to the lack of a 'jump' button. (not complaining about the button, mind you).the time it takes to bring up the save window (even on an i5 4690k and gtx970) is pretty obnoxious, considering certain other titles have zero issues with loading said menus.Some tips that pop up suggest you to use taunts, when the button isnt even bound by default.the character and weapon models look like something youd expect from the mid 2000s more than today. (think Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines number of polygons)Only half the objects that can be interacted with indicate so (Corpses of kills do not at any point indicate so) and the rest only show up when you mouse over them.Looted objects remain in world (fair enough) but can be looted once more, and with many of them overlapping, mostly clipping into the floor, or straight up having iffy clickboxes (i had to click a cultists foot, once to get any loot) youll quite frequently spend post battle clicking over and over on all the corpses to make sure you didnt miss anything, since even an EMPTY lootable can still be looted again.Its a common occurence that ""open world, go where you want"" results in a lot of lack of direction and confusion as to the focus of the game, and this is no exception by any means."

I think those two data points outline the depth of game mechanics.There is a great open world game here, but right now it is too open. While the tutorial has a handy merchant, your first area does not and you fill up with items that most games tell you are useful. But then your bags are completely full and you realize that the only way to clear space is to eat the food which is really the only useful thing that you are gathering. That magic item you carry around forever until you can get it identified? Still garbage compared to your starting gear! Quest reward you worked so hard for...  Yeah. Let's just get rid of that so that I can hold onto another piece of roasted bear that these swamp dwelling cultists must have imported.The general consensus of 'Mixed' is pretty accurate."

Again, its not a diablo clone....its maybe not even a Path'-clone-clone.I don't recommend it if you are looking for a ground breaking experience. You won't, unless this is the first RPG you ever played. All of it...I do mean ALL of it, has been done before. They did put a lot of work into it, so I will enjoy seeing what they did as far as I can take the quest-linear-story, not a fan of the quest clues.Would I buy it again if Doc Brown sent me back to saturday when I bought it?Maybe...but I doubt I would tell a friend about it."
,Not Recommended,316370,28662647,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,DrumAce,I probably would have had more patience with this game but even on the steam sale it was still pricey and for me just not fun at all.  I asked for a refund after only playing it less than an hour.  Not saying the game couldn't have potential some day but again the price for what it is and how it plays wasn't worth it to me.

However, I find that the overall execution of the game is lacking. (game mechanics, levelling up barelly seem to make a difference, combat mechanics that felt more like a chore than actual fun.)The community too seems to be barelly visible on the forums as of late... dont think this is a healthy sign.This game HAS MUCH POTENTIAL, just execution of the different game mechanics that is poorly implemented. I would give this game another chance if it gets tweaked."

(This help was received after posting on the forums requesting it, not because of my negative review as some people think)I think this is justified for 2 reasons:One, because the help players get on the forums is MOSTLY personal dev to player emails. Not a lot of dev's take time like this to help people out. Secondly, I think a few of the comments here may be correct, as the game does not have a positive review as a whole. Which isn't fair. From what I've seen, it deserves one.Another EDIT: I've finally fixed my issue. I'm not sure if it has to do with having two monitors of different screen region, but the game wasn't launching in 1920x1080 - though not being the correct region I still feel shouldn't crash the game and make it unplayable. I was able to fix this issue by changing resolution at launch to 1920  1080 in the config file.I'm really enjoying the game so far."

I can either give it a thumbs up or down which doesn't really say much.The game has potential, but as it is, it needs a lot of polish. Lots of things are clunky such as vendors. No tooltips on stats so I have no idea what strength/Dexterity do. I'm not liking how I need to spend points into a one handed sword skill to be able to be good with it, I wish it was a system where I use the item and I gain skill points. IT would be easier to switch my weapons around."

On the tutorial island I encountered a bug where the game failed to flag that you'd spoken to the NPC quest-giver (the captain) and kept a door locked; no keys, no recovery, and talking to the NPC again just told you to hurry.Promising concept, but very poor execution.Very disappointed in my purchase.

But I don't know if in this world the amount of work that would need to be done to make this game ejoyayable is within reasonable parameters.  I wanted to like this game, I really did.  I wanted to play for at least an hour, but the UI was abrasive, the sound kept cutting itself in and out, the character models are ugly...I couldn't even bring myself to finish 15 minutes before begging Steam for a refund and deleting it from my library.There is maybe what resembles a skeleton of a good idea buried here somewhere, the problem is where to even begin tackling a project that is clearly as immense as this indie action RPG hopes to be.Maybe one day you'll get it right, and I'll load steam up one day to find the problems with WOD long gone.  But maybe I'm an unrealistic optimist with too much time on his hands, writing a review for a game he can't objectively review because he could only sink 13 minutes into it before getting sick of it and thinking he could probably do something better with that $20.99, something involving macaroni.The point is I'm poor, and if I had to choose between a delicious meal of macaroni and cheese and playing this game for more than two hours...I think we'd all know what most people in my situation would do.
