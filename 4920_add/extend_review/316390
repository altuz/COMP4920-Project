However after playing the game for an hour or so and getting past the horrible intro to the game, I started to have fun. While it is not tthe best game out there, it is certainly not the worst. I wasn't sure why they were charging for a f2p game but I realised that in game, you get 100 IRL currency and a ""bond"" that can be cashed in for some basic gear. Now a lot of people ask if this is pay to win, not at all. you can buy in game items with IRL money, but they only last a limited time. But this is the nice part, you can earn these items and weapons by simply playing and finding/looting the items in game, and they will last forever.SUMMED UP-Pay To Win?A- No, you can buy items that last a limited time. However you may earn them in game and stay forever.Why Pay For A Free Game?You get in game currency that you would otherwise have to pay for IRL anyways, this way you pay less than usual and get to support the dev's. It is early access as well.Is This Even Fun?In the beggining, not at all. But I dragged on about an hour, and it suddenly became fun! After completing the horrible intro, you are free to explore and do quests, level up, and earn skills. Just like any other MMORPG. But this is in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R world and has a great community.Is the world PVP?No, there are arenas ment for PVP as well as the ""wild"".What Is The Wild?The wild is a massive part of the world where pvp is enabled and anyone can kill, killing a player has its negatives and posotives. Many players choose to ignore others and get on there merry ways. This makes travelling to foreign lands risky yet exciting. You will not only have to fear the environment, and wildlife, but also ""Bandits"". There are safe zones spread throughout the wild to protect you from such people, and safely trade your goods.KOS? (Kill On Site)From what I have seen, No. Players love working together in this game and the community is great. The game has a lot of negative aspects to killing others, such as being labeled a name such as ""Murderer"" And this will cause players to avoid you and not trade with you. There are many reasons why people do not kill on site.Do I Recommend This?For 1$, Yes. For 10$? Not at this state. This is a F2P game after all. The game is very unpolished but well worth a dollar, especially for S.T.A.L.K.E.R fans."

There are better free FPS MMO out there.  I also ran into alot of aim botters.  Once you get out of noob land and into land 2 (Gormet area and beyond) the game becomes open pvp everywhere.  Be ready to get one shot killed from the hackers and griefers.  Also, it is very tough for us english players as alot of the quest's and ingame text is all in Russian.

,Recommended,316390,29665144,Posted: 3 February,all,SanjuroTsubaki,"I recommend this game only because I used to play it before it was on steam, and it used to be a lot worse. The devs have come a long way since then. Although improvement is slow, and the game needs polishing (animations and such) it is fun, it's even more fun if more people play it. Back in before steam when people played it, there was a really good community, where one side was the guys protecting and guiding newbies, playing artifact hunter, and weapons/gear hunters, another was bandits, just destroying newbies and stealing loot.What makes this fun is that you can hear about the bandits (players that loot you as you return from an artifact run) from other players, and then go hunt them down with other members of the community, or just play a bit of bandit yourself. On top of that, clan wars can get pretty good too. This game is meant as an open PvP game and that's where it shines."

It is also free from their website but (could before hand) be bought on Steam for a special 100 ingame money.Getting right in:The title looks god awful no matter the settings, the FPS goes up and down like a hookers knickers this title needs to greatly improve these performance issues.A plus and a good thing is, it can be played in 1st person (F4) to help with immersion, NPC quests however don't help to much immersion wise as tthey are guessing games not that they are all in Russian they just hold no real interest to whoever is reading them after the 5th time you've been looking for the right NPC.Its like reading the same lines of text numerous times guessing/looking for the right NPC at the right time to trigger the right event, this chore increases the unhelpful likelihood off skip ahead important text. NPCs names are from what I've seen all in Russain which means you will more likely be checking every NPC to try and find out who the hell is who, hence the burnout above. A fix of giving them English names will help greatly somewhat with the above. Like invisible walls its plagued with completing linear collecting  tasks/quests that bores you to tears. I do hope that after the 1st town this game opens up. It could do with dumping the old tried stadard MMO stuff and replace it with more open-world survival.The controls themseves i can't really fault and seem stantard stuff for a MMO. The community I have had little interaction with its hard to know if its toxic or not due to langauge. Althou the community do love to spam areana invites every two mins that got me killed twice. Specailly when you are on your way to collecting (x) number of mutant pubez as part of the quest/task you've been given. I'm sure all MMO's are just  the same game reskinned it like they don't have a orignal thought between them.I'm keeping this title a thumbs down for now. Its just not the langauge barrers, the NPC interactions with yourself, the proforrmance issues. Its a title that has missed the boat a longtime ago, its been under delopment for years, looks older than even that. At this moment I can't see this becoming anything special, its a old game that has been given CPR due to current interest in surivial games. I would recommend any of the REAL S.T.A.L.K.E.R games over a average f2p MMO that simply plays homage too it."

76561198000624335,Recommended,316390,13816986,"Posted: 3 January, 2015",all,Antiga,"sZone is only a shell of a game, has been for years. Huge potential, but development is sloppy and slow. Badly optimized, but even on high settings graphics are somewhat a joke. Mind you, I don't care much for graphics, but this is to inform people, after all. The content that's there feels unpolished, and a constant feel of amateurism washes over you while playing.However, if you run around the game with this feeling, like I did, you will also often be surprised by the many different angles the game offers. There is plenty to do, you can put hundreds of hours into the game and still see new things the next hour. Eventually the feeling of amateurism would remain, but added with a feeling of that these devs know what they want, and what they want is ""proper"", so to speak, but also that the road there will be long and hard.--------Overall it's only barely a MMORPG in the traditional sense, and that's something i'm happy about. It may not feel very open world due to the game being composed of several (large!) different maps, but in effect you're absolutely free to go where you want. Knowledge of the game, maps, anomalies and etc is more important than hours put into the game, in many situations.Skill and/or luck also plays a big role; Where in a traditional MMORPG a lvl 10 does not stand a chance against a lvl 20, this does not apply here. Especially in PvE it's more dependant on how you handle the situation. However, as you progress, you are able to get better gear and this too, plays a big role.While in essence most quests are well made and interesting, considering they are mostly relatively simple/traditional kill and fetch quests, they are unable to immerse you properly, one of the biggest things keeping you from being very immersed is sloppy and missing translations.Overall the combat IS good, but just doesn't feel very good due to eternal lag/latency issues.It sometimes feels like the russian player dominancy ruins the community aspect for non russian players, and hackers can ruin any session at any time.Still.. I do recommend the game. It's a special game. It's one of a kind... We should be happy it exists in it's current form.We all know a true franchise S.T.A.L.K.E.R. MMORPG would be a traditional grindfest that would probably not feel anything like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. except the world it takes place in. This MMORPG, sZone, tries hard to avoid the traditional MMORPG feel while still attempting to maintain some degree of balance and still stay true to some of the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. concepts. It's far from reaching it's goal, however.Can't comment much on microtransaction/P2W, as last I played is over a year back (Except these few hours on steam) and haven't researched what is available and if any items aren't available for F2P. Far as I can remember, back then, it was Pay to Progress faster, mostly gear wise. Not P2W. But can't be sure.Edit: I read a different review stating the best armors are only available for premium currency. If true, that would without a doubt mark the game as P2W. While being extremely against P2W, I chose not to let this influence my recommendation."

I have compressed an hour’s gameplay into this five minute highlight first-impressions video if you want to see what it is like. Or you can read the review below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8r0pa-iy-c&feature=youtu.beThis game is to Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl, what Elder Scrolls Online was to Skyrim; an interesting idea with some graphical scale-back.  The general feel of gameplay is affected by the fact that a Single Player FPS (the original Stalker) has been turned into a Multiplayer TPS. That being said, the environments are atmospheric, look good and are open to exploration. Not so sure about the animations however, which currently look clunky and are incomplete. The sound also requires work but can sometimes make you jump.There does not seem to be any PVP survival element yet although there is a H2O counter among other survival based indicators on the dash. It is difficult to say anything conclusive regarding the game's mechanics however as all of the text-based instruction is in Russian.I'm giving it a thumbs up, not based on its current state but on what it might one day become. It is actually quite playable but at the same time is clunky and incomplete. However, compare this game to Day Z, which has been in Early Access for years and is still trying to get its base-zombies to work properly while its staff censor negative comments on its forums, this game is a gem. It is functional, offers varying encounters, and the devs seem really friendly and eager to receive feedback. I’m personally very interested to see where sZone will go."

,Not Recommended,316390,15514188,"Posted: 23 April, 2015",all,Sully,"sZone-Online is both a really bad online survival game, and a bad Stalker-ish clone. Not only does this game feel awkward, the quests it offers do not explain what to do exactly, the guns don’t have iron sight but rather just zooming into middle of screen, very little variety in gameplay, and boring environments that does not encourage exploration (which is kinda important in a survival-esk style game if you do not mind me saying). If you are beyond bored, give this game a try, elsewords, there are many other good free-to-play games out there like Fallen Earth"
