,Recommended,316600,18270291,"Posted: 30 September, 2015",all,somebody336,"QP Shooting – Dangerous is a vertical Bullet Hell shooter where we play as a dog girl named QP on a quest to save pudding. Pudding the food, not an actual character. It seems all of it has disappeared and only QP remembers its existence and it's up to her to get to bottom of why her favorite food suddenly vanished. As you might have gathered by now the plot for this game is absurd and all the situations you will be in are equally as odd. Throughout your journey you will be fighting street lights, trees, trains and anything else the devs happened to see while gazing out of their window. There are 5 stages in total and it should last under an hour to beat them all if you are skilled enough to beat them on your first try. A neat little feature is that even if you lose it will let you save a replay of your playthrough to see what you did wrong or to simply show off.Starting off the game you will have the choice of picking one of four difficulty modes. It is a pretty “easy” game compared to most others of the genre so my suggestion would be to start on a higher difficulty for those accustomed to these type of games. You will then have the choice of choosing one of the three fighting styles this game offers. Aggressive which causes your hyper attack to do plenty of damage but lasts a short while, Defensive is the opposite and allows you to use your hyper attack for far longer but causes little damage and Orthodox which is a mix of the two. There is even more customization, you will then be able to choose three projectile formations for your playthrough, but starting off you only have three anyways so it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it sounds.  With that out of the way, onto the actual game.First thing you will notice is how cutesy the art style is with everything having a colorful, light hearted vibe. Regardless of the theme, the game can be quite brutal on higher difficulties and with the game not having any continues you do not have much room for mistakes. In addition to just shooting, you will be able to slow QP down to easier avoid tightly spaced projectiles and the ability to change your bullet formations. Bullet formations play a crucial role in QP Shooting as enemies will attack you from the back, as well as the sides which means that if you only have front firing formations you will be unable to defend yourself and have to avoid their projectiles and hope they leave the screen before they manage to shoot you down. It offers the game a on your feet, tactical feel to it and with 28 formations to unlock there is a ton of ways to play the game and experiment. You buy more formations from the main menu using Rbit points, currency received from play.To further aid you, you have the aforementioned Hyper Attack that fills up by causing damage to enemies and are able to overcharge it up to 150% for a longer use. You can't see how far it has filled before reaching 100% charge to know how long until you can use it annoyingly enough. When it is filled you will have a giant circles with its percentage spinning around your character and that can be distracting until you get used to it. Once the hyper attack is activated, the projectiles near you will disintegrate, though this is effect will not take place again and you will still be able to get hit. The main purpose of the hyper attack is to output more damage than normal, as your projectiles grow in size and fill up most of the screen for the duration of your hyper attack. If you get hit during a hyper attack its effects will immediately end but you will not lose a life. It's a pretty useful feature and if used properly can save you from two fatal blows. The damage output is not really a huge difference from your normal projectiles, even on “Aggressive”, so you may end up using that skill as a defensive measure more likely than not.Enemies are pretty varied and you will pretty much never see the same enemy in another stage as they all have a certain theme to it. Some enemies are pretty weird and you will have no idea where from its body it will shoot the projectiles so it's best to keep your distance until you know how it attacks, that is a flaw though a pretty minor one. Though it may be in your best interest to let the enemy fire first, as when you kill an enemy all of its projectiles will disappear and turn into points. It offers a risk and reward type of mechanic though with the lack of online leaderboards it is very hard to care about points or high scores unless you more than one person plays this game on your PC. One other problem I would like to mention is that QP Shooting does not support the D Pad on your controller so you are stuck using the analog stick which is a pain. Moving back to the enemies each level has a unique screen filling mid-boss that will try to destroy you. These are rather fun to fight and break up the pace from fighting regular enemies all throughout and really helps to avoid it feeling repetitive.Fighting actual bosses is where the real fun begins and where all of the dialogue happens. Before each fight QP and the boss of that stage will talk about pudding and make various jokes, it can be funny the first time around but they do go a bit overboard with the amount of text, making you unlikely to want to read all of it again on other playthroughs. Thankfully the option to turn off all dialogue is available. Bosses can take quite a beating and throw much more intricate projectile patterns at you so that is where you are likely to die a few times. When you whittle down their health bars they will change their fighting styles and go back to max health. All those are typical bullet hell features but what is a bit different is that each boss has a familiar like a baby chick, a roulette wheel or a toy lion. These will also shoot projectiles at you and don't stay dead for long. Bosses all have over three forms so they are pretty lengthy fights and finishing off their health bar with a special attack nets some big points. They get progressively harder and harder, by the fourth stage you will need some decent skills or formations to make it through.There is a multiplier for killing enemies and will deplete if you spend too long without destroying anything. It is in your best interest to gather up points as you will be rewarded with more lives and extra Rbits that will increase your firepower. The music you'll be hearing is very hit or miss, as the soundtrack starts off pretty mediocre but gets progressively better and better the further you get into the game. No voice acting is in this game and it's all text based. Graphics do their job, though this being a vertical bullet hell, it would have been nice to be able to rotate the screen for those of us that can pivot our monitors. As it is we are stuck looking at a vertical game with most of the screen unused. Not game breaking but it is a significant annoyance. There is an option to darken the background to make enemies and projectiles far easier to differentiate and it's a nice feature for those easily distracted by the bright colorful backgrounds.  Everything runs smoothly and I've noticed no slowdowns except for when the stages start.QP Shooting Dangerous is a really good title for people wanting to bridge the gap between the Shmup and Bullet Hell genre. It is far slower paced than most Bullet Hells and with all the customization available it will prepare you for any type of gameplay other games may have. In addition there is a “Conquest” mode that allows you to save after each stage. Even if you load the game you will have the same amount of lives you had the first time you played that stage so you can't simply breeze through the game without learning how to play. If you can't beat a certain stage, it may be best to start over and choose different formations that may be of better use for that situation. Overall this isn't a great 'must play' type of game but it is both a charming and fun title."
,Recommended,316600,13036376,"Posted: 21 November, 2014",all,pepsimanvsjoe,"2D shooters are one of those genres that I can't get enough of. While I love older games such as Life Force, XEXEX, and Twin Cobra, I tend to play danmaku titles. You know what I'm talking about right? Dodonpachi, Mushihime-sama Futari, Crimzon Clover, etc. These games are also known as pudding-hells.QP Shooting is by the guys that put out 100% Orange Juice. How do you go from that to a 2D shooter? I thought this was some kinda joke. It seems like every doujin developer has a danmaku in their pocket. Still, curiousity got the better of me, so I bought this game.As it turns out, this game is legit.Hmm..Leaving ya'll in suspense doesn't quite work, when you can see the big fat thumbs-up. Oh well.Correct me if I'm wrong but the nonsense plot goes sorta like this: In a world where the very existence of bullets is being threatened, one dog-girl can make a difference. QP must brave five stages of intense pudding-filled action. Like any other super-human or prototype-ship, QP has three lives and dies in a single hit. Also, unlike arcade games, you don't get any continues. Fans of credit-feeding? Too bad. I'm going to spoil the ending to this game right now.SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERTQP becomes the Guardian of Bullets and defeats the Sweet Breaker.What a shame. I ruined the most riveting storyline of 2014 for everybody.Moving right along...Since this is a danmaku game, expect to be overwhelmed by lots of pudding. QP Shooting isn't quite like all the other shmups.Before you even start the game, you have to decide on your Rbit formations. You can have up to three, and you're obligated to switch between them when the situation calls for it. At the start you have some basic formations: a spread shot, a rear-shot, and a narrow power-shot. There's 27 formations in all, and they can include all sorts of wacky combinations. Right now I'm messing around with orbit, twin-shot, and niagara formations. Orbit is fairly decent for getting those weak enemies that like to get away, while the twin-shot provides power as well as flexibility. Niagara is just weird. There's a forward shot, but the Rbits float near the top of the screen and drench everything below with pudding. There isn't any best formation, since everyone has their own play-style and preference. So feel free to experiment, and find one that works for you.Next up is your hyper mode. As you wreck havoc, a meter fills up. Once it hits 100-150% you can unleash the hyper. Aside from an increased amount of damage, baddies cough up more chain-building stars, and nearby pudding disappears. If you're not collecting stars, your combo-chain will break, and the score will suffer big-time. Death also breaks chains, so try to avoid that too (could be difficult!). One of the other benefits to using hyper is that while it's active your chain is safe (don't get hit by any porridge though!) So what are you? Orthodox, Aggressive, or Defensive? This affects the strength of your hyper as well as how long it lasts.Each stage consists of the usual mix of weakies, toughies, and everything in-between. Weakies die to a light sneeze, while toughies require a bit of firepower to bring down. Toughies also tend to have armor. This is temporary but it severely limits how much damage you do to them. The thing is, while they can and will fill the screen with pudding, all you have to do is destroy them and all their wishes for your untimely death will turn into lovely stars. Yep, just like other shooters, QP Shooting has pudding-cancelling. You don't have to be in hyper mode either. This is where all that time spent figuring out the best Rbit formations pays off. Keep in mind though that you're going to WANT baddies to clutter your screen, just so you collect more stars when you destroy them.Unlike most shooters, the bosses in this game aren't just some huge target with a ton of heavy weaponry. They move around, they summon help, and that's a major opportunity for pudding-cancelling. All of the bosses have between 3 and 5 phases, and they'll throw around all kinds of unique patterns and special tricks. This makes for boss-battles that can be really entertaining, since they require the player to approach them differently. QP Shooting isn't just another shmup, where you spend every boss-fight, holding down the laser button and making millimeter-tight dodges.The overall difficulty of this game is on the lower side. There are four difficulty settings, but for the most part the difference is incremental and not dramatic (aside from a few surprises). It's best to start with normal, see how far that gets you, then drop down to easy for a little while. Once you get a handle on things, then you can work towards the harder difficulties. While you can't continue, the extra lives are surprisingly generous. There's also a conquest mode, where you can practice formations and stages. The setup is a little weird though. You have to beat a stage, then save the game. When you load your save, you can choose what stage to practice.This is a really enjoyable shooter, but I have a couple issues with it. These can be fixed pretty easily I believe, since they involve the UI. When holding down the ""slow"" button, a ""THIS IS YOUR HIT-POINT! SAY HELLO HIT-POINT!"" message circles QP and her hitbox. Naturally QP only dies when her hitbox is touched by pudding. This game operates under the assumption that players know what a hitbox is, so why the message? It's just a distraction. This also applies to the hyper mode indicator. This larger circle surrounding QP lets the player know they have hyper, since their eyes can't always check the top of the screen. All this seems a bit much. Wouldn't a subtle aura suffice? Something noticeable but not distracting. Players aren't going to care if they have 124% or 109%. They'll active the hyper when they need it, whether its for scoring or survival. All I'm asking for is an option to remove this unnecessary info, so I can focus on not getting killed.QP Shooting - Dangerous!! is well worth a look. As shmup-starved as Steam is, I'm willing to accept anything. However, I can assure you that this recommendation isn't a result of low-standards. The 2D shooter has been around for 30+ years, so I don't tolerate screw-ups. This game not only gets the fundamentals right, it also delivers some neat twists and a sufficient level of challenge.Not bad for a video-board-game developer eh?"

,Recommended,316600,12978161,"Posted: 16 November, 2014",all,AlexWrench,"A seemingly typical doujin shooter in which bullets are almost always cancelled when their source is killed. In this way, a little extra emphasis is placed on accurate shooting and offensive play. To help, you also have a swarm of ""R-bit"" guns orbiting your ship which you can re-arrange on the fly in a number of patterns. It's only through the skillful application of these patterns that you can dispatch enemies before their curtain fire reaches you, uncluttering the screen and keeping your anime friend alive. In addition to your hyper mode functioning as a shield in desperate times, extends come fairly easy in this game, making it forgiving in spite of its difficulty.Its oddball style will undoubtedly make some players feel alienated while others roll their eyes. However, for the thoughtful STG fan who can embrace (or look past) its quirkiness, this is a robust and flavorful offering with a great soundtrack and a subtle bite in its mechanics."

All of the characters in this game use two demensional sprites in front of a three dementional background that scrolls as if they are fighting in the skies.+ The music in this game is very cute and well done. It fits in perfectly with the looks and design of this game. I found myself enjoying the game's music as I played through the game.+ I have yet to play this game using my keyboard, but using a controller is really nice for this game... once you find out which button does what. Overall, the controls work very smoothly for this game.Cons:- Regardless of whatever difficulty you're playing with, this game is VERY unforgiving. Enemies will fly around in all corners and shoot at you endlessly until you either kill them, or wait for them to fly right off the screen.- While I said earlier it's very fun to play this game with a controller, it's also disappointing to see how many buttons on said controller go unused for this game. (only the 4 main buttons, the left analog stick, and the Start button are useable)Final Verdict: 8/10 ~ Overall, I found this game to be very fun and challenging. I enjoy some Shoot 'Em Ups and I am an anime fanatic, but that is not my reason for giving this game a positive review. The graphics, the soundtrack, and the controls appeal to me so much, and you will get used to them pretty quick. I will recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Shoot 'Em Up games and are looking for a challenge because this game's insanely hard difficulty will test you as you try to play through it.If you want to play this game and try it out for yourself, then by all means play this game. :D:"

,Recommended,316600,12945228,"Posted: 14 November, 2014",all,Shade,"Uncomplicated but challenging Bullet Hell game that doesn't take itself too seriously, sporting a good soundtrack and quirky characters.The mechanics are pretty easy to get accustomed to, but hard to master - this game uses a Chain system for scoring, gives you the ability to engage a Hyper Mode that is important both for survival and for scoring, and allows you to pick three shot types per run that you can switch between on the fly.Clever usage of the right shot type in the right situation can make the difference between nightmarish bullet walls from all sides and a mostly empty screen, so some strategy is required - you can't just rely on the basic Front shot type all game and expect to win.That said, the game is never unfair - for instance, you're given advance warning when enemies appear from locations you might not expect them to appear from, a gesture that some other Bullet Hell shooters today still don't seem to deem necessary.Overall, a quite fun game. Fans of the Bullet Hell genre will probably feel right at home. For people that are new to the genre, the game offers a ""Conquest Mode"" in addition to the standard Arcade Mode, allowing you to take on one stage at a time rather than all five in one run, so it's probably also a good entry title."

I've played many danmaku shooters - Touhou 2~14 (several of which I've 1cc'd on Hard Difficulty), Bullet Heaven 2, Suguri, and Murasaki, to name a few - and in every one of those games, it was very clear what on-screen was safe to collect and what enemies and bullets you need to avoid. In QP Shooting, however, everything on screen looks like it just blends in with itself (due to the lack of high-contrast borders on everything), making it extremely difficult to discern what's safe and what isn't.QP Shooting's difficulty comes mostly from visual-effects distraction and pointless screen clutter rather than actual curtain-fire bullet patterns; many times, it's very difficult to determine what is a bullet and what's a harmless visual special effect on-screen because the special effects get way too cluttered when combined with the flurry of things you're trying to avoid. When you kill an enemy, it (and the bullets it shot) all turn to semi-transparent stars that quickly home in on your character; said stars are the same size and color as the very bullets you need to avoid. The rotating flashy greenish circle that's constantly around QP only serves to let brigher-colored bullets (especially the green ones) blend right in, making them more difficult to see. When anything on-screen is destroyed, it goes up in a poof, obscuring vision in that area briefly and making it hard to anticipate anything going through it, especially if you're getting swarmed at a closer range.This game feels like the equivalent of playing a driving game where you have to avoid obstacles, and several holograms of said obstacles clutter the path around what you actually have to avoid.If you don't care for the bullet hell gameplay and just want it for the silly story and cute protagonist, or you just want the 100% Orange Juice DLC that comes with it, then I'd say this game is just right for you. If you want a playable bullet hell game, there's a vast number of better alternatives than this."

They do not lie. Even playing on normal difficulty I'm having to take breaks to prevent rage overloads. By far one of the best shooters I've played in a very long time. Controls are spot on, no wonky hitboxes that may or may not tag a passing bullet, enemy and boss mechanics that will actually require a bit of planning and changing of combat styles. Even easy is no joke as the enemy numbers and attack speed are the same, they simply launch a few less projectiles each volley and bosses lose a couple of their moves. Storyline is hilarious, simply an inugirl in search of pudding. The settings and characters you meet along the way are some of the most cliche yet amazing ever. Probably my largest drive to progress is just to see what new boss they will throw at me next.If you like shooters with incredibly tight controls, varied enemies, insane difficulty curves, and wide selection of attack types, you want this game.

This is very helpful for those who are still practicing the swing of things or want a certain way to fight during hyper mode.Past that, there is a good variety of (strangely cute) enemies and bosses, of which some designs may even provide a small chuckle or a questioning ""Why is a tree attacking me?"" as you continue on your conquest with pudding.Graphics: 7/10First off, for those who played 100% Orange Juice: Look at QP in her full vectored glory!The graphics are nowhere near top-notch, but for what they are: they are good. I think the coloring choices and graphics are perfect for the style and attitude that this game attempts to portray, and definitely give a cheery vibe as you go on your quest for the elusive pudding.One thing I have to comment on though is the background scenery you see as you play through stages. It gives a 2-D in a 3-D environment feel, and as soon as I saw it, I instantly got nostalgia of Ragnarok Online. This touch definitely gave it a much more connective feeling towards me, personally, but I'm sure we all can agree how enticing 2D-in-3D always seems to look.Music: 8/10I'll try not to give a very biased view on this. The music is catchy, it's cheery, and it fits the mood. While I personally like it, it may not be for everyone. That doesn't mean you can't easily mute it, though.The music gives an exciting pace to the gameplay, but it is very, very short. Most of them seem to sound like 20-second loops, so if you plan on playing this game for a long period of time, I'd recommend turning it off if you value your sanity.Story: 5/10Wait. Scroll up and read the quote at the beginning of this review. Yep, that's the story. Carry on.In a more serious tone... While it is a incredibly childish storyline, with not much of plot twistery to boot, it still gains some momentum thanks to the graphics and music. It does feel like a cheery stroll to find the pudding, running into friends, beating the love out of said friends, etc. and as my broken record says, the mood says it all.Don't play this game for story. Play it for the gameplay. It's fun.Overall: 7/10It's a good game. It's a fun game. Throw down your bucks and gain a ton of hours in return. If you must, wait until a sale. Use your card-farmed monies. Whatever you have to do. If you like shoot-em-ups, you WILL like this game. With it's many different play styles, modes, and stages, it's sure to keep you entertained and give you your money's worth in exchange.Now go and get that pudding.EDIT: Forgot to mention. Buying this game also gets you QP - Dangerous!! in 100% Orange Juice. Which is pretty nice."

You can basically get through Touhou by holding down Fire and concentrating solely on weaving through the bullets. Trying that in QPSD will get you nowhere.  You have to aggressively take out minor enemies to clearl the screen of an unavoidable wall of pastel pain pellets.  Also: the Formation system is a ton of fun to play around with and effectively means QPSD has hundreds of playable ""characters"".It doesn't have the most memorable soundtrack, but then, it wasn't created as a vehicle FOR music. Bottom line: It's a great shooter and if you've ever enjoyed one you won't regret it."

QP Shooting Dangerous is special to me.Important to note out that Once Again, Orange Juice Have Nailed the soundtrack to this game. If your not interested in purchasing the game (Which I think you may be slightly mad in not doing so) Then I would urge you to check out the track list to QP Shooting Dangerous and Suguri as they have been the best track lists I've heard in a very long time.The game on my system Runs at a Solid 60fps without fail and set up is very easy. I was expecting trauma as most of the games I buy require you to have to search out a way to get games running properly and to the correct screen measurements (Looking at you eXceed :( )  but with QP , No such problems and everything was ready to go within a matter of moments.As for the game itself, Its very bright and colourful. its also very crisp and sharp which I love. Control of QP is very slick and smooth and as with most bullet hell games, the feeling of destruction is very warming to the heart. all for the quest of pudding I may add.I say, Yes!! Definitely give this one ago as the price is extremely good value, And let the music psych you up as millions of projectiles hurl themselves at you without mercy.I need to get this soundtrack. :)"

By going back and re-beating stages and doing better than you did before, you have the chance to finish with more lives, which means you start the next stage with more lives!QP Shooting - Dangerous features R-Bits as QP's main method of attacking. During each playthrough of arcade or one save of conquest, you can set 3 different formations of R-Bits. R-Bit formations can be bought at the in game store, featuring the bunny girl Aru. R-Bit formations can do many things, such as sit in front of you, sit behind you, form a shell around you, or even rotate around you.The music is very catchy, the art is appealing, and features a fun story. The game doesn't take itself very seriously, which is nice. Sadly the original QP isn't on steam, so QP's relations with the characters in the story isn't very well known to us. There is also the mysterious Kyupita, a character mentioned in game, but never seen.Bonus: If you own 100% Orange Juice, another game created by Orange_Juice and translated by Fruit Bat Factory, you unlock a character in the game.I highly recommend buying this game.
