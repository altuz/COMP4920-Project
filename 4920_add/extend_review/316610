I took my PC over to my Grandpa's house, where we generally eat and watch crappy TV movies every Saturday or Sunday. No one there plays games. Period. Well, no one happened to be watching the TV, so I plugged my computer in and fired up steam in big picture mode, and started to play some Poker Night 2. Once I switched over to A Good Snowman, my family started to ask...""What the crap is this?""""Uhm... What?""and my personal favorite... ""You don't have a girlfriend, do you?""But everyone kept watching. Then my cousin, my age, started to help. It took us about 15 minutes to figure out one of the puzzles, But when we did, it was like, ""ohhhhhhh, wow we're dumb"". My dad came over and watched a bit and laughed when I'd kick the tables or chill on the hedge while we discussed the strategy.I must have told the game mechanics to five or six of my family, seperately, as they all started to watch and ""help"". My aunt finally plopped down and really started getting into it. I was starting to get bored, and tried to change games, but she started getting agitated and said, ""put the snowman game back on!""After I handed the controller over, she played with intense concentration for about an hour before we told her we needed to leave. She asked if I could build her a PC so she could play it and other similar games on her own.Thanks, Snowman team, You guys got some of my family to actually play with me. It's only taken 15 years to get to this point."

The game is so eloquently simple it can't help but remind you of your childhood when you made up and played with your imaginary friends in lieu of real ones that wouldn't make you stick your hand in a scary hole in an old tree or harass you because you didn't quite fit in.A good friend is hard to build, find, and keep."
,Recommended,316610,14659956,"Posted: 26 February, 2015",all,flesk,"A must-have for puzzle enthusiasts!This is without a doubt the most charming puzzle game I have ever played. You play as a featureless and lonely-looking monster who builds snowmen and gives them all their own character traits and names. And then he hugs them. Well, it's up to you really, but naturally you want to hug your new friends?The mechanics are similar to Sokoban, but your goal is to stack three snowballs with gradually decreasing size on top of eachother to create a snowman. Snowballs come in three sizes, and what makes this less trivial than it might sound like is that a snowball rolled through a tile filled with snow will increase by one size. And if you don't have one of each size lined up properly when it's time to stack them, you'll probably have to start over. Like in Sokobond, there is a convenient erase-one-step feature too though, so if you haven't messed up too badly, you might be able to save your effort without starting over from the beginning.As you solve puzzles, you open up more routes through the snow-clad park the game is set in. You can choose which puzzles to tackle when, to some extent, and if one particular puzzle stumps you initially, it might help to come back to it later. As you progress, you'll find more and more complex puzzles, and some of the trickier ones even require you to build two or three snowmen in the same area. If things get too tough, you might enjoy a breather on one of the many benches scattered throughout the park.The game allows for many different interactions with your environment beyond building and hugging snowmen and they are all animated in a simple, yet delightful manner. Try kicking a table, shaking a bird bath, roughing up a flower or wrestling a pine tree. Most of these actions are inconsequential beyond adding atmosphere to the game, which they do brilliantly, but some might have unexpected results. Don't be afraid to experiment.My first run through the game took about three hours. Or so I thought. The last required puzzle of game has you building the developers Ben & Alan's snowman equivalents. On completion of this puzzle, the gate to the exit opens and the camera pans over the park of snowmen, before a dubious ""THE END?"" is displayed on screen. So what's this then? I don't think I'm spoiling too much by saying that, yes, this game contains secrets. Furthermore, the secrets are excellent and complex, and they at least double the length of the game.I am a sucker for both cleverly designed puzzles and secrets in games, and this game offers heaps of both. The switch to Haxe in place of the Adobe AIR runtime used in the developer's last game, Sokobond, even further sweetens the deal for Linux users. Throw in the gorgeous visual and audial design direction of this game and a few dozens of hugs and I'm completely sold.In conclusion, I compell you to buy this game now if you too have a monster within you who is desperate for puzzles and affection.Note, this is a small rewrite of a review I wrote forGamingOnLinux.com:http://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/adorable-sokobanlike-puzzler-a-good-snowman-is-hard-to-build-released-today-a-musthave-for-puzzle-enthusiasts.5012"

Seemingly the only creature of your kind, you will play as a introverted and lonely, but bond-hungry Monster. Your mission is building snowmen/ma'am for a battalion of friendship to fill the void you feel whilst trapped inside your beautiful, but hopelessly empty garden. As you interact with your environment: rolling snowballs to proper sizes, sleeping on benches, hugging snowpeople you've built, and maybe ever chasing a butterfly or two, you will slowly feel empathy and maybe even frustration (depending on your puzzle skills) with Monster's situation in his botanical cell. Free yourself, and crave for something more than solitude's wintry embrace.8.9/10"

Thus, my qualms about the length of the game are unfounded, and you should go and buy this game now.--------To be honest, I expectedmuchmore difficult puzzles from the creator of Sokobond. This game took me slightly more than one hour to complete, and thus left me a bit underwhelmed. Nevertheless, the visuals are lovely, the sound is excellent (full disclosure: I have a soft spot for Ryan Roth's music), and the puzzles are clean and satisfying, albeit lack in number.

,Recommended,316610,28515325,"Posted: 21 December, 2016",all,Kuroonehalf,"Pretty good little puzzle game. The general gyst of gameplay is you push balls of snow around in order to build a required number of snowmen per level. Similar to an Increpare game, you're given a rewind button that lets you quickly backtrack on mistakes and focus on the puzzle without distractions. Although there's only a couple core mechanics, the developer did a good job of exploring their possiblity space and presenting the more elegant findings.Controls are just simple enough and serviceable but I wish it had been more refined. Too often I found myself grabbing onto bushes when I meant to turn a corner, for example. Not a big issue, but with such a small amount of mechanics in play you would expect it to be more refined.The whole game, post-campaign content included, will amount to roughly maximum of 6 hours of play, so it's a rather pricey game for its content. At full price it's a bit of a tough sell, but discounted I think it's a great experience that puzzle game lovers will get a good kick out of."

,Recommended,316610,24245856,"Posted: 10 July, 2016",all,ReverendTed,"A Good Snowman may be Hard To Build, but it's an immensely satisfying endeavor.  There are a few relatively simple and highly intuitive mechanics that allow the game to ease you in to its puzzles before ratcheting up the challenge by subtle tweaks of the configuration.  The puzzles are simple enough in design that if one has you stumped, you can roll it around in your head while you go do something else for a bit.  And then just when you think you've mastered the game's last challenge, they find a clever way to turn those mechanics inside out...and now you realize you might be 50% done.The presentation is perfect for a reflective puzzle game - soothing soundtrack, subtle sound effects, crisp and simple (yet utterly charming) visuals, and while solving a puzzle could be its own reward...well, there's an undeniable sense of contentment that comes from hugging a snowman."

Then they took it a step further, true completionists will hate everything to do with this game and how much thinking is needed.Playability, Basically anyone of any age could pick it up, even replaying some of them is quite fun, although it might be fun if there was a 'move counter' for each snowman so you could see how few moves it takes you.There is nearly no interface, and that makes the game that much better, everything is immersion based, you go to options; it is the dude thinking to himself, not just a immersion breaking up-in-your-face window.Even though I've completed the first half of the game, I can see myself coming back to the godlike-advanced parts later on for a challenge."

,Recommended,316610,14667658,"Posted: 26 February, 2015",all,nixalott,"(English)The most enjoyable things in the beginning of a game for me were charming, cute and funny main character, nice animation and art, beautiful atmospheric music and sound effects and quite interesting developed mechanics of classical sokoban. It was also awesome to meet little nice details like that you can sit on a bench, touch different objects, chase butterflies and so on. Some of the puzzles were really tight, but most of them were of moderate difficulty and some were pretty straightforward.However while progressing through the game I was getting more and more tired and bored as the game for me at the moment have become mostly a set of puzzles without further developing of mechanics or another interesting changes in gameplay, and I just wanted to complete them all to finish the game. But when I've completed seemingly the last puzzle I've found that it's not the end!I just want to give a hint to others (without spoilering) that besides this first obvious part of the game there is another one, at least as large as the first one. And exactly after I've reached this second part I've become very intrigued by new strange things that start to happen and by new mechanics. This have revealed the game for me from another side and all of the tiredness and boredom disappeared and I was like ""OMG, what's happening here? I certainly want to complete it to see what else the game have for me in the end"". I became much more emotionally closer to what was happening on the screen while proceeding the second part. I couldn't calm down until I've truly (I hope) completed the game. Recommend it to all who like to solve puzzles and who like unexpected turnaround of events. :)The only truly annoying thing with this game was that it crashed sometimes in the late part of the game and in ""about"" menu after choosing a name on my 64-bit linux system. Thankfully, after quick relaunch the game continued exactly at the same moment it crashed.(Русский)С самого начала игры я получал истинное удовольствие от наблюдения за очаровательным, милым и забавным главным героем, великолепной анимации и художественного исполнения в целом, замечательной атмосферной музыки и звуковых эффектов и весьма интересно развитой механики классического сокобана. Впечатление ещё больше усиливало множество небольших приятных деталей, таких как возможность сесть на лавочку, трогать разные объекты, гонять бабочек и тому подобное. Над некоторыми из головоломок мне действительно пришлось поломать голову, но большая часть из них были средней сложности, а некоторые были довольно просты.Однако, по мере прохождения игры мне становилось всё более и более скучно, я даже стал несколько уставать, поскольку на тот момент игра для меня по большей части представляла собой просто набор головоломок без дальнейшего развития механики или каких-либо других интересных изменений в геймплее, и мне уже хотелось побыстрее выполнить их все чтобы закончить игру. Но когда я решил казалось последний паззл, я обнаружил, что это ещё не конец!Я хотел бы дать другим подсказку (при этом не спойлеря), что помимо этой первой очевидной части в игре присутствует ещё одна, по-крайней мере не меньшая первой. И сразу после того, как я достиг этой второй части я стал весьма заинтригован новыми странными вещами, которые начали происходить, и новой механикой. Это раскрыло для меня игру с совершенно другой стороны, и всю усталость и скуку как рукой сняло. У меня на уме было только ""Боже мой, что здесь происходит? Я хочу обязательно пройти это всё, чтобы увидеть, что ещё игра приготовила для меня в конце."" Я стал эмоционально гораздо ближе с тем, что происходило на экране, пока проходил вторую часть. И не мог успокоиться до тех пор, пока действительно (надеюсь) не прошёл игру. Рекомендую её всем, кто любит решать головоломки и кому нравятся неожиданные повороты событий. :)Единственным досадным моментом с этой игрой было то, что она время от времени вылетала в поздней части игры и в меню ""about"" после выбора имени на моём 64-битном линуксе. Слава богу, после быстрого перезапуска игра продолжалась ровно на том месте, где она вылетела."

Completing the dream world took longer to solve than the initial game! I think the game should have communicated better to the player how to access these extra levels (after you finish the game,go through the newly opened gate in the room you began in, and sit down on a bench to fall asleep). Not only because the game is a bit too short without them, but in particular because the dream world is so cleverly designed that you gain new appreciation for the game."

Even at $5 this is pretty ridiculous, I beat the game in 80 minutes and left it running in the background for maybe 20 minutes, and never spent more than a minute on any of the puzzles.  The biggest puzzle in the game came at the end after clearing the last puzzle and trying to find the rest of the content - there's no clear indication you're done, just several empty variations of the park map that you can wander around in.

These crispy companions don't make themselves, however; the recipe for each successful snowman calls for a small, medium and large snowball, and our monster friend must judiciously manipulate the white stuff in each section of the garden in order to bring home the hugs.  If things become too taxing, the monster can take its frustration out on innocent birdhouses and park tables or unwind by peering through a telescope.  While the game world is rather small, the developers compensate for this brevity by including a larger, deliciously clever puzzle that requires players to approach the snow rolling from a rather different angle.A Good Snowman Is Hard To Buildcertainly doesn't feature the same caliber of mechanics found inSokobond, but it's still a cool excursion deserving of your time."

The ""levels"" within the world are separated by hedges, and you're given a small space to make your snowman by stacking small, medium and large snowballs together. Most puzzles begin with three small snowballs, which you roll into the snow to make larger. Grass patches are left befind as you roll your snowballs, allowing smaller balls to move over them without fear of becoming larger. You can also pass a smaller snowball over a larger one (i.e. medium/small over large, small over medium) in order to solve some puzzles.Once you complete a puzzle, your snowman magically grows clothes and has a name (don't forget to hug them afterward)!

The music changes based on your actions, which is welcome addition to the rather cute graphics."

,Recommended,316610,33888986,Posted: 29 July,all,Pogo,"SnowkobanAGSIHTB is an adorable block-pushing (ball-pushing, I guess) puzzle game. The premise is simple enough: Maneuver the snowballs around the playing field and push them into a stack. If a small snowball is rolled across a patch of snow, it will grow to become a medium snowball and eventually a large snowball. Snowballs can only be stacked in order of larger base to smaller top.The puzzles are very accessible. There is a jump in difficulty in the late game, but it's not overwhelming or unforgiving. Many of the puzzles have multiple valid solutions. It's even possible to get an advantage by using each area's multiple entrances, but in order to get the ""best"" solution you'll want to stay inside the playing area. There is a rewind function, so you don't have to completely restart a given puzzle if you make a mistake on a long or elaborate puzzle.Each completed snowman is presented with a name and some sort of hat or accessory to add character. Puzzles can be restarted and replayed at any time, so you can try to find alternate solutions to already-completed puzzles.Ultimately it's a clever twist on sokoban puzzles and a very cute presentation.Butterfly / 10"
