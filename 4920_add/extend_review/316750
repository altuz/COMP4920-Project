Such a shame that in this day and age, we can't get a working, updated version of Tetris. After the fiasco of the next gen console releases and total lack of support for fixing them for just under a year now, I don't know why I'm surprised.No, I cannot recommend this to anyone as it stands now. The game keep crashing, you can't remap your controls, very clunky user interface. I'd like to give an opionion about actual gameplay, but I can't due to the constant crashes. From what I can tell, seems to be a direct port of the console versions, slow play and slow line clear delay.I'm going to give it some time to see if Ubi does anything about these issues, but I'm holding no hope going by their previous track record for the console games.Very happy that I can get a refund through Steam for this as it's the ONLY reason I decided to purchase and try it. Was hoping to finally get a decent game with decent multiplayer, but I guess I'll have to just keep on waiting."

But I've actually been able to play without crashes on both systems after- Running steam and Uplay as administrator and verifying the integrity of the game cache- On one system, I also had to run the game on Win 7 compatibility mode (I've no idea why this worked)This doesn't mean that you'll be able to run it without crashes(edit) First impression:There are too many small annoyances (menu, audio and visual) that has nothing to do with gameplay/game modes itself. Navigating through menus feels unintuitive. The method of remapping key bindings looks amateurish. There are some unnecessary, annoying visual effects during gameplay that can't be completely turned off. So overall, it just leaves a bad taste. This game has several game modes in addition to the standard marathon, sprint and battle, but there is nothing special, exciting or worth mentioning about them.Online multiplayer is practically dead, and there doesn't seem to be a way to invite someone for a 1v1 match.This game was released 1,5 years on pc after its first public announcement. However it feels (or is?) rushed, lacks proper support from Ubisoft, seems to have been a low priority money grab project, and it is clearly a lazy, unoptimized port from console to pc.If you consider it nothing more, nothing less than a simple single player tetris game, then you could enjoy it casually on a rainy day. However, I would definitelynotrecommend this pc version of Tetris to anyone.PS The best thing about Tetris Ultimate is its commercial."
,Not Recommended,316750,19607338,"Posted: 10 December, 2015",all,kastle09,"Okay finally arrived better late then never. I have played only about an hour and dabbled in most of the game types (Except the ones that crashed) and here's what I think.Lets start positive because there are some good things. It looks great. I like the aesthetics it is probably one of the better looking versions of Tetris there is. People who prefer the really really minimalist designs in some of the unofficial variants like Lockjaw or Nullpolimo might not like it but I do, especially when you compare it to last gen which i really did not like. There are also a good number of game modes so every kind of player will find something they are after, whether its Marathon, Sprint or Battle. Okay thats all I got for god things so lets move on.My criticisms are divided in 2 minds, one as an aspiring game designer and one as a Tetris fanatic.I really dislike the approach to TU's Menu design. It looks good, and animates well. But its not intuitive and clutters the screen with a lot of information most of which is hard to direct around at first. Especially since there is no real tutorial. Or I should say there is one but its placed in a spot that no first time player is gonna find. And when you do get to it you are faced with an encyclopedia of text. If you were trying to follow the instructions you would have to constantly flop back to that menu.I could understand if the dev team wanted to not have the players go through menu after menu but I would of rather something simpler. A starting menu that says ""Online, Solo, Settings, Profile"" which then opens up into something else. instead of an overwhelming amount of text as soon as you hit start.On the subject of clicking things. I'm not sure why they decided to make somethings clickable and somethings not. Everything in the footer requires key presses and somethings require clicks. You have to be a little more consistent than that. Its like trying to play an FPS in an options menu. Also who thought it was a good idea to make the two keys to press ""O"" for confirm and ""Backspace"" for exit. Those keys are in the middle of nowhere and doesn't relate to any of the keys during play.And now we come to some issues with the gameplay.Something happens the faster you want to play and it comes from your expectation compared to what happens. 2 things that are really critical is line clear speed and when you are allowed to rotate the incoming piece. The longer that delay is between what you want to do next and when the game allows you to do it Is very important especially the faster you want to play. Very important for sprint players.I am not that quick of a player, relatively speaking compared to the really really hardcore players, but even I am getting irritated with the delay. When you know what to place next, and when you know you hit the button to rotate, but the game lets you down by not keeping up with you. Its very frustrating aspect.The decision to allow sensitivity was good. Maybe not to the degree I'd like, something finer than a 1-10 scale would of been nice, but a lot of variants don't have it so fine. The decision to Lock the Controls and the Piece orientation on the other hand is baffling to me. I had no idea they did this because I thought it was a given before it came out. I play with the numpad because it means I can rotate both ways with just my right hand. Thats how I play thats whats comftable for me. I also don't like using the space bar for drop, I prefer a smaller key and one next to my hold like ""z"" because i prefer using my index finger instead of my thumb.these specific issues for everyone to play a certain way makes me think Tetris Ultimate had a very clear goal in mind and I'm not one that likes it.If you are a casual player who doesn't play tetris often, maybe occasionally a long time ago. The game is fine. There are bugs here and there (3 of the game modes crashed on startup for me in the first 20mins) but its manageable, and if you are able to navigate the god awful tetris party up system, its okay.The problem is I don't think its worth it to get it on PC. because if you are playing causally, 4 controllers will work, 4 keyboards won't.More pressing is I don't think its worth your $15USD. You can get the same things from other outlets that let you satisfy that craving and then move on... and get back to Fallout 4 or something. If you hadn't already bought the game on your XBone or PS4, theres no reason to get this version.If you are like me and you are a Hardcore player. This game is missing far to many options and crashes to many times to be taken seriously for your time. If you are a marathon player you would rather play TGM, if you are a multiplayer player you would rather play Top or Cultris. If you are a sprint player you would rather play Nullpol or Lockjaw. Most of them cater what you are after, better. and most of them are Free to play as well.The only reason you would play Tetris Ultimate is if you hadn't tried any others."

I was so excited! And then I saw the reviews. I figured I'd waited this long so I should still buy it and give it a shot. If it's bad I'll just refund it, right?I will be submitting my refund request as soon as I finish this review.First thing I noticed is that I had to initiate uPlay which always reminds me of those people in high school who try to include themselves in everything you and your friends do. And since I never use uPlay, it had to update first, I had to enter the product key for the game, and then wait for it to decide to let me play.The second thing I noticed is that my controller didn’t work. At all. I didn’t try very hard to fix it (because I’d already lost hope), but nothing I did made it so I could use my controller in any part of the game.The menu didn’t look bad, but it was a little over the top for a tetris game. It seemed like it was designed for a touch screen. Also the key bindings in the menu were strange. Who uses the letter “O” to accept changed settings?The gameplay didn’t seem very different from the mobile app I use, though I didn’t play it for long.Now the music on the other hand was terrible. I thought I was playing tetris, not haunting a victorian era mansion! The only time that kind of music would be appropriate for tetris is if you were playing in a funeral home.Ubisoft, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you haven’t been flipping the pages on your calendar, but it’s 2015. How is it that you couldn’t make a decent tetris game? All I want is to move around different shaped blocks with catchy music playing in the background. Because of you, Ubisoft, I’m just going to download a ROM of tetris from the days when game developers didn’t have their heads so far up their butts they could make a simple game about falling blocks that didn’t sound like it needed some freaking zoloft."

The 3DS version had a working replay system, with integrated StreetPass and friend replays shown.I probably missed a few points somewhere, but that's what I think of the game. If you want to have a bit of fun playing the single-player game modes and don't mind the game crashing a few times before you get it to work, then spend the $15 on the game. If not, don't. In my opinion, and quite ironically, The 3DS version, which is the first version of TU that was made, is the best version in terms of gameplay, although it's unfortunate that the online play was kinda bad."

There have been so many decent Tetris clones that they could've literally just copied all the features and put it in their own game to make it good. Instead, they took features that were even included in the older ""official client"" of Tetris Friends, and removed them.The menu graphics are blurry, it looks like it was designed for console then just copied over to PC, most of the multiplayer and achievement features are unintuitive, the game ignores about 20% of your inputs, and there is very little depth to building up your Tetris profile.I wrote a full review on my website:""Tetris Ultimate for Steam/PC is a disaster"""

,Not Recommended,316750,19610147,"Posted: 10 December, 2015",all,addama,"It looks great, but this is probably one of the worst implementations of Tetris I've played. You can't remap the keys, which is pretty standard on PC. There are only a handful of single player modes, and they're all just variations of straight up Tetris (no 3d tetris, column tetris, etc). I have a feeling they're going to make you buy all of the ""fun"" modes they've come up with over the years from the store for 5 bucks a pop.The only mode I WANT to play (Endless) is locked behind getting level 15 in Marathon. Maybe I'm too old for this game, but by about level 9, Marathon is too fast for me to be accurate in my block placement and I fail pretty quicky after that. So... I guess I'm just never playing Endless mode?They've focused too much on social play and stats, and not enough on just making the game fun to play. I don't play Tetris to socialize. It's not a social game. Not only that, but it's attached to UPlay, which is a useless relic they're still trying to push on people.In short, it's like UbiSoft is stuck in an echo chamber, conveniently sheltered from everything anyone's ever complained about with Tetris. It doesn't need to be social. It doesn't need a cash shop. Get your base game stable and up to par for a PC game, and then we can go into those areas."

The content currently found in Tetris Ultimate is nowhere near the value of $15-$19. Tetris by default has a ton of replayability though, and the core concepts of Tetris go uninterrupted for the casual fan. There's several game modes as outlined, and each one barely scratches the surface of where these styles of play originated from. However, even with the shallowness of these modes, they're all bundled together in a package deliverable to the casual player.Big negative points given for no native button mapping nor controller remapping support. Casual players, the targeted audience of this game, are the ones who require this feature the most. It is 2015 right?Negative points are given for a lack of colour and style choices. It can be difficult to make out the ghost pieces, and not everyone tolerates the default colour scheme or skins. Not to mention there's no colour-blind mode for those impaired.If Ubisoft or TTC provide 'DLC' (should be free content patch) then this game will certainly be a requirement in any casual fans library on Steam.Hardcore GameNot going to bore anyone with long winded paragraphs, here's everything I found wrong with the game competitively:- No IHS/IRS- The ARR and ARD scales are 1-10 only, with no inbetween- The ARR and ARD scales are on the low end of speed spectrum. 7-10 could be nearly 2x-3x faster.- Garbage is terrible all around- Bag system seems to bug out (I got 4 I blocks in just 2 bags?)- No option for line clear delay speeds- Online matchmaking 'battle' mode has terrible locked in presets, needs to be faster- No button remapping in 2015- UI isn't truly scaled to different resolutions- Can't customize the UI when playing Sprint/Battle/any mode, the preview and hold boxes are locked in place- Can't change the bright colours, very hard on the eyes to play more than an hour- Steam and uPlay integration is pretty lacklustre- There's more, but its just too much to listIfyou bought the game, and there's no patch by January 2016, refund the game."

Then it was released and instantly had bad reviews, so I waited for the price to drop before buying it. Even though the reviews were almost universally bad, I figured, it couldn't really be THAT BAD, right?Wrong. It really is that bad.Single player is okay on a higher end PC: i5 processor, Geforce GTX 745, 8 GB ram gets me high 50s for frame rates.On a low range Core 2 Duo, with 2 GB ram, and a Radeon HD 2400 XT I can get 25-30 frames per second with everything turned down in single player.But why so hardware intensive for a puzzle game that's been around for 30 years? Obviously it was poorly optimized for PC.Still, I could have overlooked this if local multiplayer worked right, but it doesn't. You can get an Xbox360 controller to work in single player by turning on controllers in the Options/Extra menu. However, when you try to add in a second player for multiplayer is where the real shortcomings of this poorly done port occur. You can add the second controller on the main screen to initiate multiplayer by pressing the A button but after that you can't actually start the match because the second controller then becomes completely unresponsive. So this completely ruined the main reason I wanted this game for 4 player Tetris.Add to this wonky menus, uPlay (not that bad but just 1 more annoyance to a game that doesn't work) and no ability to rebind keys and I'm just waiting 2 weeks and keeping my play time under 2 hours so I can get a refund if nothing gets fixed. Actually, any kind of patch to any of these issues might at least convince me that Ubisoft cares enough about it's product that I might decide to keep the game. Sadly, this seems unlikely as most of these issues have been reported since the launch of Tetris Ultimate on December 10 and nothing has come out (ie: we know and we're working on it) or any updates whatsoever. The only thing Ubisoft has is a guy saying, ""Submit a support ticket”.Save yourself the trouble, don't buy it until you see that it's actually been updated to work.Edit: I gave Ubisoft the two weeks to make any change or to at least acknowledge the many issues that are occurring, and unfortunately, nothing positive has happened, so I am requesting a refund.On a side note, if anyone has a Wii, Tetris Party Deluxe is an awesome game that has multiple game modes, plays smooth and supports 4 player local multiplayer!

As of now, I don't recommend Tetris Ultimate, at all. Not because of other negative reviews say, like the game freezes, you need UPlay, its DRM, will not launch, etc. My reasons for not recommending this game are completely different from what others have been saying about this game.The simple fact that there are better alternatives in Tetris, like Tetris Friends which is free with cheap microtransactions for example. You can spend the $15 that this game costs and buy yourself a lot of neat stuff through Tetris friends. Like Tetrimino styles, ghost styles, backrounds, win backrounds, sound effects, etc. Also has many game modes, an active community of people who play Tetris Friends, leader boards, etc. More worth it if you are a Tetris Fan.Another free great alternative that is 100% free is Tetris Online Poland, or TOJ for short. Which you can grab for free by just googling it. It has an online community just like Tetris Friends. Except everything is basically free and the microtransactions have been yanked out. Its an online Tetris viewer that was once Japanese and now translated into English. Which blows away Tetris Ultimate by an Ultimate Landslide.Issues with this game? Allow me to break this all down for you. My dear consumer.1) No one plays this online. At all.2) You absolutely need UPlay to play this game. Because Ubisoft.3) The game plays incredibly stiff. Moving your Tetrimino's left to right feels bleh, making it a huge problem in higher speed levels.4) There is absolutely nothing new nor spectacular to warrant this the Ultimate Tetris.5) Backrounds plays with your eyes. It has all this blue haze in the backround that trips your eyes out. Do not play if you are drunk or high. If your eyes are sensitive to constant motion, you may get sick.6) The music is an uninspired remix of the original Tetris theme. Really shallow and doesn't put you in that, ""Tetris"" mood.7) You need a high speed cable connection to be able to even touch this game. (Not a problem for me, however.)8) Does indeed crash often with no updates from Ubisoft. Figures.In conclusion my dear friends. Where should your hard earned $15 go? Go to Tetris Friends website, make an account, buy some diamonds, spend it on some cool stuff, and you have yourself a versatile active community of Tetris friends with a staff that actually cares for its fans. It is also completely free. Or download Tetris Online Poland (TOJ) which is completely free for everything.Thank you for reading. Avoid purchasing this game as its the Tetris you are sure you haven't been waiting for. Or want."

Now:- If we want to play 3 people locally (one keyboard and two gamepads), player one uses the keyboard but is also controls the player with the first gamepad.- If we want to play 2 people locally using only gamepads, player one controls both players.Versus local gameplay only works when you only connect a gamepad, so the first player uses the keyboard and the other the gamepad.Talking about the key mapping, it is console like, so very awkward for PC: you cannot press the key you would like to use for each movement. Instead of that, you have to go forth and back until you select your desired key.And all these bugs and inconveniences just trying to play with friends in the same computer. I do not know if I can connect to other players online, but with the problems I am having locally, I am almost sure that online play is also full of flaws."

Ubisoft now own the Tetris license for PC and console, taking all but the mobile license from EA - and if this implementation (PC) is anything to go by, I don't want to contemplate any further titles. I love Tetris, always have, and I've bought every iteration I can for each platform, I've found the build quality at least acceptable on all releases (even the terrible releases mentioned above).Feels like a cheap cash-in, made by people who either didn't have time, resources or inclination (possibility being powers from above leaving no time, money or peope) to do this in a way that does the brand justice.

The additional modes like battle, haunted and landslide are very good additions. Perfectly playable, visuals and audio fits the game nicely. Clear and not overly fancy visuals.There are crashes in the menu when starting a game sometimes, but normal gamplay is not affected and a restart fixes it. It doesn't annoy me too much.Local multiplayer is not possible unlike on other platforms, even if it could be if Ubisoft cared to fix their game. EDIT: Local multiplayer is playable, see pcgamingwiki. However, you need as many Xbox controllers as players who wish to play. While one controller (designated No 1)  is a ""throwaway"", you have to deactivate it. Player One is thus always the keyboard. Still not acceptable, but at least it works somehow.There are no proper scoreboards, I don't even know what my high scores are except in Marathon and Sprint.Navigation in the menus is quite cumbersome, but it works.As soon as a tetris game with proper mechanics, modes and visuals like Tetris Ultimate comes out, but fixes all mentioned issues, don't even think to pick it up. But until then, it's great fun. Thanks to Steam refund policy you might want to give this one at least a try.Edit: I have to deactivate one of my monitors to start the game."
