,Not Recommended,316810,12111526,"Posted: 15 September, 2014",all,slowpoke,"the game is very simplistic and linear. i would not recommend this to anyone unless they assign very little value to their dollar and want to play a difficult game that uses poor mechanics to accomplish its level of difficulty.you must travel through the exact same dungeon each time you play. there is no random generation, there are no alternate routes, there are no interesting environments, there are no pacing mechanics. when you die you lose all your gear, meaning that upon your first death you will most likely save significant time by just ending your run immediately instead of trying to stab skeletons with the basic sword 30+ times in a row. there is a significant amount of mandatory backtracking through empty rooms each time you play the game. approximately 40% of your time spent on a run will consist of walking back through a long series of already cleared rooms.the combat gives you very little to work with: jumping can potentially provide you with an extra attack due to frame reset upon landing, but makes you very vulnerable. ducking makes you stationary, resulting in it being a worthless mechanic. enemies don't follow the rules of the game: they ignore damage from traps, and in addition to attacking you will also harm you upon contact while constantly walking forwards. this means that all forms of ""normal"" combat (ducking, blocking, parrying) are thrown out the window since you can not backstep their approach during all of these maneuvers. instead, you must backstep-stab-repeat ad nauseam in order to guarantee defeating an enemy safely.there is very little content. every sword is identical in usage except for the randomly varying damage ranges and the possibility for 1 of 3 elemental enchants that have a 10% chance (RNG? in a game where ""quick reflex and timing are key""?) to trigger a minor effect. there are also 3 shields in the game with chances to trigger minor bonuses. that is all of the ""gear"" in the game.you will quickly grow tired of going through the exact same basic rooms time and time again, fighting the same limited collection of simple enemies."

There's a subtle beauty to the game but whether or not it's worth $10 is questionable.It's a great way to waste an afternoon but it relies heavily on the nostalgia that many indie-pixel games do, expecting players to find their own fun in a rather simplistic game is a tough call. Each room is similar, often too similar or out-right copied, flipped and filled with different enemies making it difficult to really discern where the player is going, a problem that's exacerbated by the slow movement in the game. Combat is also a slow dredge but very rewarding as each enemy has the capability to kill the player who in turn must rely on quick thinking and a few simple moves to over come a single or multiple enemies. Puzzle rooms are cleverly designed with a few simple pieces working together to create a real challenge, and the timer is a unobstructive and positive addition for potential speed-runners.If $10 isn't a huge price tag to you, the it's a good game. Else, wait for it to go on sale."

For example, one of them complains about backtracking, which was not only a minor part of the game, but is also very easy since the enemies remain dead. Is it overpriced for what it is? Sure. When I sat down seriously with the intent to beat it, I completed the game in 40 minutes. $10 seems a bit much for that, but it was a good time. The controls are simple, and they are tight. If you died, it's completely your fault. There isn't much healing, so you need to be on point. It is hard, but fair, and if you don't like that type of game, *that's fine*, but that doesn't make it a bad game.Really, the price for the amount of content is the only valid complaint. The game can be grueling and stressful, and this is completely intentional. It feels like Dark Souls when you're out of Estus and have no idea how far away the next bonfire is.

I bought this on 50% sale for 5 euros, and I must say the game is fun and addicting. The game is all about combat which is nice, however this combat is almost the same all the way through. Also there is no tutorial for the combat system, so you will probably end up dying a lot of times to your first encounter with a sword/spear.The game also lacks content. It is the same dungeon every time and the items are almost the same. Even the achivement system is poor in my opinion. The game is fun though and the artstyle is just amazing.In short: The game lacks content. The game is probably worth 5 euros, but over that is just not worth your money in my opinion."

Understanding that this is by design and is meant to be adapted to is essential to enjoying and completing Shadowcrypt.The description may sound like the game has procedurally generated levels, but it does not. This isn't a bad thing though, once you get into the game you learn to embrace it. The levels are technically non-linear, but at the end of the day, they're linear. They just involve exploration and remembering where to go; the crypt is confusing and a bit maze-like, but that's a part of the game. Getting lost in the crypt is also part of the game. You'll see.You get three lives, and when you lose them all you start over from the beginning. A complaint I hear a lot is people saying once you lose your first life you're screwed because you lose all of your gear (which is an important part to progressing). To these people I say: Don't get discouraged! You can beat this game with the starting crappy weapons, as impossible as that may sound. If you're good at fighting in this combat-based game, you will move forward. And there will most likely be a weapon or shield drop or a treasure chest. Just keep going, don't give up!Final verdict:This is one of the BEST games I've played this year. It took me a long time to beat it and I appreciated the mood, the music, the excellent character animation, the sound of the dungeon doors opening and closing, and especially the challenge. It's old school and feels like you picked it up from the SNES bin at the local game store, and I love that.I'd love to see another game like this from One-bit Punch, or a sequel. I'd love to see more weapons, more levels, and more boss fights. I couldn't tell you how much money I'd pay for another, longer, more expansive version of this exact game.It's grindy, it's retro, it's moody, it's a real challenge. I'll be playing it more in attempts to get the ridiculously challenging achievements. I highly recommend this game. 10/10"
,Not Recommended,316810,17959172,"Posted: 9 September, 2015",all,Azathoth,"Shadowcrypt is a semi-challening combat focused platformer that takes obvious influence from classics like Castelvania and Zelda.  Unfortunately it is missing a few things that would make me recommend it.  The lack of content for the price is the biggest issue here and if the game was a quarter of the price then I would perhaps look at the game differently.Like arcade games of old, death will put you back to the beginning of the game.  The dungeon is not procedurely generated, so death will mean you will be playing through the same dungeon over and over.  This isn't a problem if the level you are forced to repeat is enjoyable.  Unfortunately in Shadowcrypt, many rooms are empty and encounters are separated through backtracking which becomes tedious very quickly.  Most of my playtime was spent jumping through empty rooms that look almost identical.  More encounters and some new designs to make areas fresh would have worked wonders.Combat is quite enjoyable, certain enemies require patience and if you try to hack and slash your way through everything then you will most likely die.  Again though, lack of content means that the combat isn't as good as it could have been.  Swords and shields are great, but to limit combat to only these weapons with some slight variations based on damage is just poor.  I would have loved a staff with limited usage or a slow and heavy battle axe to crush certain enemies under their shields.  The lack of content just pops up time and time again.Repetitive encounters, environments and a focus on backtracking just make Shadowcrypt more of a chore than it should be.  At the moment it is too expensive for the content and you will be able to find much more enjoyable experiences for less money.  If you are a fan of classic arcade platformers then maybe put this one in your wishlist and wait for a massive sale."

Is it a difficult game? Yes. But I've played it for about 2 hours now and I'm having a blast! At first, it was annoying to deal with the skeletons with the sword and shield. But after playing over and over again, I found myself breezing through the parts that I deemed were too difficult at first. It goes to show that the more you play, the better you WILL become. You just need to patient. Now with that said patience is a MUST in this game. If you are not patient enough, just prepare to see the game over screen over and over and over again. But if you are patient, then you will find quite a bit of enjoyment in this game, especially when unlocking a new area and you find a new foe to deal with. The only bad thing about the game one could say is that after you die, you lose everything. It's similar to likes of Gradius, once you die you lose everything. This is the only big gripe I have with the game. But again, if patient enough you can persevere through the crypt and defeat the necromancer. I have yet to do that quite yet, but I am willing to do it any day!I say buy it!"

Shadowcrypt is brutal and unforgiving romp through a dungeon filled with enemies that are all capable of easily wasting your hero if you think you can just hack and slash your way through them.The game doesn't ask much from the player in terms of platforming or exploration, but can be taxing in the combat department. knowing when to block and when to strike can be crutial, and being able to block a standing or crouching attack can be the difference between life and death to your hero.The basic level asthetic might be enough to turn some players away, but it only furthers to highlight what this game seems to center around; the combat."

It has potential, but as it stands, I don't think I'd recommend to anyone.The combat is supposed to be tight and unforgiving, but without a dodge-roll/active block, you're pretty much stuck doing hit & run/shield bashing tactics. Enemies can take upwards of 20 hits each, and are bound to hit you a few times in between, taking off precious health, which is almost impossible to replenish.You have 3 lives to beat the entire game. Lose em, start over from scratch. Also, whenever you die, you lose all of your upgrades/pickups. It kinda sucks, especially later on.The animations & visuals are pretty decent, and I'd have loved to see more out of this game, but it feels like the potential here is wasted a little.Overall, the game isn't that fun, and without a serious overhaul of the combat, probably never will be.http://youtu.be/9YsL0XDXWrY"

76561198013262788,Recommended,316810,12120231,"Posted: 16 September, 2014",all,Adjudicator of Moths,"I bought this game simply for the combat system. It looked precise, fast, and not too complicated. I was not dissapointed. Everything in this game is very precise; jumping, attacking, ducking, and bashing. To put it simply, this is very much a game where you will only die if it is your fault. So far the game has been very fair, but still difficult.This game is not randomly generated rooms. It does not advertise randomly generated rooms. Every playthrough will have the same rooms with the same enemy and trap placement. The only thing random about this game is the item drops and on-hit modifiers. Some people might want randomly generated rooms (and it is appealing to subsequent playthroughs for some games) but this game is in the mindset of Legend of Zelda II, Castlevania, and classic arcade games. Every encounter is carefully crafted, not generated.The combat is precise, simple, satisfying, and difficult but fair. When you are not moving or attacking, your shield automatically blocks hits. Enemies can do damage to you with attacks or by walking into you. If enemies didn't deal damage from walking into you the game would be very easy. Some enemies have no good way to counter you if you just duck and stab. Ducking doesn't let you shield bash, but dodges high attacks and blocks low ones, making you extremely defensive. If they couldn't walk into you to deal damage, every encounter would end with you ducking and stabbing their ankles to death while taking no damage. Doing hit and run tactics by constantly running and stabbing is sort of viable, but not nearly as fast, satisfying, or viable as just keeping enemies back with a shield bash. It's the superior tactic. The javelins help in terms of dealing damage from a range, but you have a limited supply and they don't deal a lot of damage. Attacks and shield bashes hit all enemies in front of you which helps make groups manageable, though so far I haven't had more than two people attack me at once. Again, if you take damage in combat, you only have yourself to blame.This game does not advertise itself as an RPG or a rogue-like. It is very much an action game, and a very tactical, precise one.The atmosphere is nice, but nothing special. You trek through a fairly standard dungeon with nice pixel graphics and a fitting soundtrack. It's decent, but nothing to scream about. The pixel lighting is very nice though and adds a whole lot, though.EDIT:Simply playing the game for a bit longer showed me what each element and shield does. Fire for damage, ice for stun, and lightning for knockback and piercing javelins. Defender has a chance to stun, Avenger for damage, and Hammer for extra knockback. It is a fairly short game, but a fun one that I can see myself replaying a lot. The only thing that takes away from this game is it's relatively short length and everything that comes along with that. The story is minimal, but not really important in this type of game. If this game was ever expanded or used as a basis for another game, I would like to see pretty much more of everything. More kinds of enemies, more traps, more weapons, more elements, more shields, more rooms, and more areas. The number of these things in Shadowcrypt itself suffices for its scope, but there really is only room for improvement."

A good retro feel, but in no way low budget.Gameplay: Combat is quite simple, but overall extremely challenging.The multitude of weapons with different effects, aren't always just ""better"". This forces you to choose between them, which is nice.So... what is missing? Oh yeah, I'm not having fun! The extreme difficulty means you will go back to the beginning a hundred times at least. This would be fine, if not for the fact that the levels NEVER CHANGE. You go through the beginning stage again and again, and after a while it just stops giving you any satisfaction.Also, you have three lives, and you can pretty much die four times before getting a game over and going all the way back. But you know what? You might as well just have 1 life. Because the fist time you die, you immediately lose the weapons you picked up thusfar. And when that happens, your (ahum) butt is grass. You might as well restart. The further you got into the game, the more this is the case.I've heard someone say to not be ""discouraged by this"", but honestly; the ONLY way you can beat the rest of the game is by killing all the enemy in extremely cheap ways. Waiting instead of skillfull fighting, and some room lay-outs make even THAT impossible. That, I'm sorry, I cannot see as a good gaming element.In the end; this game, I feel, does not use it's full potential. It would do the creators very good to take a page out of the ""Binding of Isaac"" game mechanics, where every time you restart the game a new stroy is ahead of you. Intead of what i can only discribe as a tedious waste of potential.I will not recommend this game, BUT if you are into hardcore challenges, like retro games and don't mind the repetition, I would tell you to buy this."

I played it a little before getting a refund for it.I like the difficulty and the general idea of the game, but the advertised non-linearity, as said in other reviews, just leads to lots of running around aimlessly. Which is even more awful given the repetitive design. It's not like you're aimlessly wandering around through beatiful and unique landscapes. Which makes it even harder to remember which door you took last time and which you have not tried yet.The combat is ok. I really hate it, though, when I am locked into an animation in a game where very quick reaction times are asked of the user. If I cannot attack because I might have to block an enemy attack which may or may not come, all the while the enemy moving in on you (which is bad because you lose health if an enemy runs into you without even attacking) makes for some really frustrating experiences.Then there is the absolute randomness of drops that may make the game really easy or really hard, purely depending on your dropluck. You can get a 12dmg sword off the very first super easy enemy and then breeze through the game for quite a while or be stuck with your starting sword, finding it almost impossible to beat harder enemies who have absurd amounts of health. Which also ties in with the terrible decision to make you lose any swords/shields you have picked up when you die, basically dooming you.Item drops should get progressively stronger as you progress through the game and you really should not lose the items you gathered when you die. That's just a super bad design move as it leaves you with barely any damage on enemies with extremely high health later in the game.I may pick it up again when it's a lot cheaper than the 5€ I got it for on the sale, but I'd really appreciate some changes to the game to make it a little more friendly. The game is hard enough through the combat patterns and limited lives. You don't have to ♥♥♥♥ people over even harder by stripping them off their gear on death and way too slow attack/shield bash animations."

The mechanics are simple with a small learning curve. It's linear, and all you'll need is a good memory The unpatient will find this game annoying, and the reviews saying,""buy this on sale"", they are correct.What hurts the game the most is the wall cling. It's doesn't always hit, and usually with doom underneath your feet."

Just as most of the users have stated it is pretty much a copy paste from rooms, however there is a little bit of a learning curve as far as how you fight. I have enjoyed this game for what I have played it so far. I have just not been able to survive through the first dungeon."
