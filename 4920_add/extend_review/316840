,Recommended,316840,12251703,"Posted: 26 September, 2014",all,MelficeOne,"By now, its cute. Altho the ""8 chapters"" may be misleading at the start. Since every chapter is pretty short by itself, usually just one mission.Now, the actual reviewing starts. I havent played into it too much, I am just 3 chapters in, but that was already enough to see some core gameplay.lets start up with the battle system - The card based system may seem a bit complicated at the start, but in the end - its not. Cards have 5 Levels - 1,2,3,4 and S - and 5 actions - Attack, Special, Block, Dodge and Magic. you draw a hand of 8 and pick 3 of them. higher card does its action and when its a standoff there is a rock paper scissors system to determin who gets a hit in. Strategy comes in when you take enemy Prediction into account, meaning the color of their cards. but theres a guy right at the start explaining you all that.And even tho it seems ovrwhelming at the beginning, it flows from your hand after 2 or 3 fights.now to the art style - the FaceArt is pretty well made, the Intro and Chapter End Pictures all have a nice feel and good handdrawn style to them. the world is pretty colorful, altho sometimes a little overwhelming (more later). The character models themselves seem to bee pretty SD style, means they are more head than anything else.Music - from what I could experience, the usic is good. Battle music gets one pumped and the town has that nice quiet peaceful feeling.but I cand give all good things. some negative stuff that sprung to me.first of all, You are playing a thief whose dayjob is to be a Private Investigator... best part - he goes thieving without any different outfit. He is out there in the same gear he can be seen through the day. then in the 3rd chapter someone actually comes into your office, having a job fr your thief Alter Ego... I will take it that the Guards are really stupid, this is a THief training Town or Suspension of disbelief.then, the city is horribly cluttered. At least the starting one. Some paths cant be seen until you run into them, same with pickups. a lot of buildings you can only identify by waltzing right in.all in all, I like it. Its to be recommended.PS: if the dev reads this - could it be that this is a sidestory-ish of tears for Tiara ?  since I get a vibe from some names (namely the namegiving ""Goddess Tear"" as well as an Item that summons Tiara in Battle."

Like any RPGCombat is a game of Rock-paper-scizors mixed with RPG elements and card fights. Takes a while to get used to it but once you do its a breeze.Downsides is that the game revolves entirely in the same town. Adding a new character here and there. This isn't something new on the JRPG world, but makes you wish the map was bigger.Pretty solid game, if you are not buying this full price, give it a chance on a sale. It's worth the time."

It hurts me deep in my shrivelled black heart.This game does everything SO right in terms of the the major things you expect from an RPG. It has excellent characters, an interesting setting, nice storytelling with story missions and smaller more inane side missions just for character developmnent/fluff.Seriously its very well done, i have seen many MANY AAA publishers do far worse in this regard.Then the combat system comes and ruins what would otherwise be an indie gem.The combat system boils down to dicerolls plain and simple. Its card based so RNGesus had best be with you to draw high cards/your enemy draw low ones. Then to double dip on the randomness the game has a 20% chance of trolling you.Let me explain, when an enemy plays a card it tells you what category of card was played (defence, attack, magic etc) but 20% of the time it will LIE. So you play your cards according to what the game tells you then SURPRISE you are now dead because all 3 cards were lies and you played the wrong cards!.Fun right?You will be trolled and have to reload ALOT since there is no consistent strategy due to that 20% troll chance and just plain bad luck if you keep drawing low during a boss fight."

The amount of customization that went into this RPG Maker game is pretty impressive. From a technical standpoint, I'm not displeased. The character design and artistic direction also overall remains satisfactory.Where things fall apart actually is the writing. It falls flat more often than not. You'll start a mission or side story and just as things begin to seem interesting, or you're invested in a cause, it immediately ends. For example, one of the last story missions I did involved me learning more about a shady finance company in town. The two main characters get involved in the plot, and then I sneak inside the building. It is not much of a scenario, we're done in less than five minutes with hardly a hitch other than one guy who tries to beat me up as I leave. The conclusion of the situation isn't even brought up in the ending, I simply return to my home and then can continue to the next part of the story where then in the next scenario I learn the company closed down. But why, how, I'm left with questions and I wish they were addressed.There is no problem with the idea of playing town vigilantes or heroes or thieves, or whatever exactly I'm suppose to be. But the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The townspeople did not grow on me, nor did I connect with the main characters either. And that's a shame, cause this kind of idea really could work well if just a bit more effort was put into the writing quality."

A lot of work went into this one, tweaking the systems of RPGMaker to create a unique game.  While RPG Maker games are often decryed as cheap and worthless, it is clear a lot of work and programming went into creating this one, and the result is everything I expected.  I plan to spend much more time enjoying this one."

Really make me think for a sec what should I doI love the set and the plot of the game. The story flows just nice with episodic sytemi loove the dialog in this game. It keeps me want to advance the story and finish the gameI loove the art that appear every end of a chapter. Sometimes it gave warm feeling in my kokoroI loove how developers put the secret in this game. Feels so clasicI looove how detail the sprite and eventing. Make always keep my my eyes at characters movement and eyesI looove how polished some part of this game. That final boss entrance cinematic, give me chill and nostalgic feelingI looooooooove the soundtrack of this game. Really brilliant and engagingNot playing many games from RPGMaker engine, especially the old one. But I can say Sacred Tears True is one of the best game developed here, especially if you love many elements from old JRPG. Every fans of JRPG should give this one a try ;)"

It uses a card-based rock-paper-scissors type battle system that is easy to learn but hard to master.  This simple innovation makes the combat in the game tons of fun.The characters were very interesting and the combat especially was well drawn/animated.Just note that there is no ""save the world"" typical jrpg plot here.  Instead, this is more of a ""slice of life"" rpg story where as the days progress and more jobs are done, you learn more about all the characters in the city.  In essence, the development of characters was made the plot, and I really enjoyed that.Highly recommended to fans of jrpgs who want something a little different."

I want to point out that the other reviews address legitamate issues, like the font size/style (the game need to have the japanese localized font to look better, there is a post about how to do this). There are complaints about the simplicity of the games' combat, admittedly the combat doesn't have too much depth but is still fun for that same reason. At times you will not think about how you are using your cards (randomly given card based combat, you will see) others I literally take like 5+ minutes before make a move. There is luck involved sometimes but for the most part if you strategize well battles will be a breeze. Don't forget to look at the guide attached to the game. It's the readme.html file, explains how to play, what stats are for and what they do (the game isn't thorough about explaining these in-game).The Pros:Innovative-fun combat system albeit somewhat repetitive(stategic at times)fun DialogeSerious plot moments, satisfying conclusionMaybe some Romance (I thought it was nice)Cute art designMemorable CharactersThe Cons:poorly styled text (have to manually get japanese localized font to fix)True ending is REALLY HARD to get (well you have to check everywhere since enemies don't drop fil)Game still good without True endingCombat takes a while to get used toCertain characters plot not flushed out enough (i didn't unlock ALL chapters so that may be why)All-in-All a great wonderful game I'd recomend to ppl that don't mind playing an RPGmaker style game, and are looking for something with great story and decent gameplay."

Also as far as I know you can't escape once you trigger an encounter. Game is tiny - handful of dungeons and one city.It's bad. There are better jRPG's out ther for similar price.
