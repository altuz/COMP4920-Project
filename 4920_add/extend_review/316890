76561198067758778,Recommended,316890,18202448,"Posted: 26 September, 2015",all,Crestfallen_Rose,"I'm always on the look out for noir games, and I was curious when I first heard about Calvino Noir's concept.One of the aspects I enjoyed most about the game was the atmosphere: the black and white backgrounds with the art deco style; the traditional rainy, gritty, tragic theme of the noir genre. It was like playing through an actual movie, with a fantastic voice over reading out the narrative, making it more immersive.I also enjoyed the characters, a lot of them were very charming and likable.Wilt is the main character of the story; a war deserter who makes his living as a thief-for-hire, the exact opposite of the typical detective noir protagonist. It was an interesting change of pace. One stormy night, Wilt is contacted by a mysterious young woman, Siska, who offers him what seems to be a regular, run-of-the-mill job. Or is it??Along the way, Wilt comes across various characters, each with his/her own motives, some will join his quest for the truth - while others will try to get in his way...The voice work also made them feel more natural. My only disappointment about them was that Wilt's backstory felt unfinished. And I feel as though I didn't play with Arno (an old friend of Wilt's from the war) as much as I could have; I liked him, but I felt as though he was an unecessary character given his limited skills.The story was nice, but I feel that the ending was rather unfitting and anti-climatic; there was a really good build up for the ending and it really did feel like it just backslided into the mud. But, then again, I chose the 'neutral' ending, there are still two others that I need to try getting - maybe there is a more fitting one.The game itself was rather addictive; there were a lot of rooms I wanted to explore and I found the aspect of sneaking around very tantalizing. But, a couple of the puzzles were a bit fussy, some were also buggy, but I managed to get past them so they were easy to overlook. The only real complaint I have is the check point system: In a single level, there are about two or three check points in set locations that are activated once you and your teammates are gathered around it; I really wish there was a manual save system, but I suppose it adds to the challenge.Personally, my experience has been enjoyable and I can see the replay value; there's still a lot to explore, there are other dialogue options and there are other endings to experience.If you enjoy the noir genre and stealth mechanics in games such as Dishonored, for example (it's a far cry, I know, but I've played both games and the stealth mechanics felt both punishing and rewarding at the same time), you might like to give Calvino Noir a try. Granted, the price is a bit steep, so, I recommend waiting for a sale before buying."

You may be interested in this. CHECK OUT SOME GAMEPLAY FOOTAGE beforehand though! Also wait til it's on sale. If you're a fan of moody Noir era / Detective stuff you'll probably enjoy what this has to offer thematically. The writing is definitely the highlight of the game, with seemingly simple but very challenging gameplay. It reminds me of an old NES game where you would also sluggishly hide behind dark corners, but I can't remember the title of that game... *shrug*I advise waiting until it's on sale, I picked it up for around 10 and think it's worth that value, kinda priced a little high as far as some of the clumsy mechanics go. Some very atmospheric moments which the designer (s? it may be all a solo work) deserve credit for.If you're willing to die (A LOT) and have the patience for a trial and error, simple interfaced game with moody environments and great writing, and definitely if you're a fan of Noir content, it touches on the genre's themes in a unique way. I would recommend this more for the content than the gameplay..."
,Recommended,316890,22850125,"Posted: 7 May, 2016",all,CorvusCorax,"A noir type of stealth game released initially for the smartphones, Calvino Noir tells a story altogether in 7 chapters (divided up into 3 acts). We assume the control of several individuals, each with a different ""ability"": Wilt can take down enemies by choking them, Siska is an expert at unlocking doors while Arno is the only one who can operate the machinery found in factories and other places. Oh, and The Mole is someone who can get past any guard since he is considered to be one of them.The premise is very interesting: they set out to uncover the secret of a distillery after stealing some vital documents. Of course, as it is normal in such stories, there's a conspiracy in the background and almost everybody amongst the fat cats of the town is involved. We get to find out about the background of some of the characters as they regularly converse throughout the levels (we can call these cutscenes).Now, essentially, the game is about getting from point A to point B while enemy guards represent obstacles on each level. Wilt and his gang can run but this generates louder noises. They can use their flashlight but guards can easily notice them if they get to a certain distance. Technically, flashlights are not necessary (the game is not that dark), however, coins are hidden on each level (20 pieces) and only with the use of our torch can we spot them. This is quite the challenge: 1 or 2 can easily remain at the end of each level - thank god the game saves our progress on each stage.The game looks very nice and while it is mainly presented in black and white it can provide you with an enjoyable atmosphere. I especially liked the big halls or wide streets where the background was still visible in the far distance. I also liked how our flashlight makes certain objects cast their shadows. I wish there was a zoom option to be able to see how detailed the character models are.And here comes the bad stuff: while the guards react to their fellow colleagues being choked by an unknown intruder they try to locate us (as the source of sound) while being completely disinterested in seeing a couple of dead bodies in a room. They do not really search and once they surveyed the spot in question for a couple of seconds they return to their duties. Because of this the levels where Wilt can be controlled do not really offer a challenge. Still, we get to be shot down due to the clunky controls and the awful hiding mechanism: hiding is possible behind certain objects but the characters do it rather slowly.Then, of course, we cannot get away from the fact that this is a mobile game port: the main menu has barely any options for settings and the font is huge - they could have just reworked this with the inclusion of some extra graphics options but they did not.In conclusion, Calvino Noir manages to be a good stealth-based side-scroller game with an excellent noir atmosphere. At the time of writing this review (May 7th) this is 85% off which is an instant grab for those who like the genre."
,Recommended,316890,26328807,"Posted: 30 October, 2016",all,h.barkas,It's disappointing to see this game getting a mixed score for reasons that seem ridiculous to me. Some complain about the lack of a tutorial while actually you're getting introduced to the possible actions for your characters at the beginning of the game which are self-evident by the way. Others mention the lack of options in the main menue. The game runs in your standard desktop resolution or windowed that's all there is to it although I'm quite confident you could force additional options via your driver settings I saw no reason to do so as Calvino Noir works fine in 4K on my system.When you first start the game you are greeted with the language options in the main menue and the game got stuck there.The easy solution I found was to open Task Manager with Ctrl-Alt-Del and closing Task Manager again then clicking on the game icon in the task bar and voila the game worked without a glitch ever after (you only have to do this once at the first start of the game).The best way to play the game was mouse only for me as it allows the necessary precision for your characters movements.You will play with up to three characters simultaneously and this gives you opportunities to try out different strategies to achieve your objectives.The game takes place in Vienna in the thirties of the last century and the Art Deco game world is beautiful to look at.The Jazz soundtrack and the voice acting are top notch.I played until the cemetary level in about 4 hours and think I played about a third of the game.Many reviewers mention the infrequent save points. I can not confirm this. There are more than enough save points and you'll lose only a few minutes if you fail your mission.The game rewards exploration as you find money throughout the levels which you use to upgrade the stealthiness and movement speed of your characters.I don't normally review games before I finish them but as Calvino Noir is in the Halloween sale 90% off I wanted to recommend the game to potential buyers asap. If you love stealth games and/or noir games you should try it out. For 1.49 there's not much to loose.For me the game gets a well deserved 8/10.

The story is good, the graphics are nice and have this atmospheric touch. It's a very noir-equse and I love the feel of it but the controls are utter garbage. This is originally a game that was released on iOS and the dev did an extremely lazy job on porting this to PC. The PS4 version is no better. It's like the dev literally just copy and pasted this game on PC. It still has the iOS interface which I find not only odd but downright annoying when playing. The iOS interface sometimes conflict with the controls way too often when playing with a gamepad. Not so much when playing keyboard/mouse but it's harder to move your character up and down stairs than on a gamepad. Doesn't matter what you prefer, you are going to run into problems with the controls. There is also frame rate issues through certain levels too. I really wanted to finish this game but I dropped it when there is a part where you run into a crane for a second time which is chapter 5. There are only 7 chapters to the game. Thanks to the iOS interface, the crane becomes a difficult task on just moving it and it bugs out on you and sometimes even getting stuck in one direction. It's a good game if it wasn't such a lazy port. It's a 5/10 for me. It's playable if you can get past the awful controls."

The story, atmosphere and voice acting kept making me want to give it another go. Finally, after conquering the first couple of stages I was extremely hooked and committed to finding the necessary solutions to complete the game. I still am stuck on the very final level, but I suck at stealth games and get frustrated after failing so much!You play as several various hard nosed individualistic survivors of a city that has run rampant with crime. The goal is to prevent this 1930’s city from completely falling into disarray. Each of the 3 characters you play as have individual skills that complement the group and allow you to trek past a heavily guarded underworld for one last chance to save the city.I like that this was more of an incremental stealth game; allowing you to find some semi-safe spots further strategize your route through sewers, over rooftops and inside some swanky buildings. The graphics, voice acting and story are all top notch, but I just can’t wrap my head around the $15 price tag. It’s only 7 levels and if you don’t suck at stealth games like I do you can completely finish in just a few hours.Overall, I would value this title at around $3.99 or less even though it’s pretty sweet. I just refuse to knowingly pay 3-4x the amount of the same game as an app.(Vacation Review #7 of 28)Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

If you're looking for a competent stealth game, please do yourself a favor, skip this game. However, if you enjoy noir fiction, it might likely fit your taste. Overall, don't hold your expectation too high or you will be disappointed.As a 2D stealth game, it fails.The game looks good at first sight. Darkish sky, pouring rain, everything you'll expect for a noir game to look like. However, before long you'll notice that the graphics glitch frequently. Flashlight beam turns into a square, background changing its color, everything covered in grey... all these make it harder for you to get immersed, not to mention the lack of details in the scenes.The control feels bad. Except pressing a few hotkeys to toggle run, turn your flashlight on and off, switching characters, and the last one I don't even know what it does, you'll be playing the whole game clicking the left mouse button because everything from movement to interactions are assigned to it. I'm okay with point & click gameplay, but the problem is, even the simple clicking doesn't work reliably in this game. It's common that you clicked somewhere but the character is unresponsive or starts moving to a different direction.Enemeis (security guards) are stupid and don't response properly. Every gurad has a set patrol route and they are supposed to be triggered and start pursuing you when your enter their vision field or hear the noise you make when you're running around them, but the whole triggering and pursuing mechanism is faulty. Sometimes guards can be triggered miles away, and sometimes they don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about you even when you're running back and forth above their heads. Fortunately, you'll probably get use to it after two or three chapters.Monotonous combat. To be honest, combat in this game is close to none. I know it's not that important for a stealth game to have an excellent combat system, but in this game, fighting the enemies is just too tedious and unrewarding. There's only one character that actually has the ability to fight (Wilt, the protagonist) and the only way he can kill enemies is to strangle them, that's all.Undeveloped upgrade system. You can upgrade your three main characters in the menu by spending the gold coins you collected, but it's unnecessary and doesn't seem to be effective.Frustrating saving system. There're several checkpoints in each chapter and they're usually far between. As long as one of your characters get killed (one hit kill always!), you'll need to restart from the last checkpoint. Also remember that you'll need to juggle around 2 or 3 characters in most chapters, one little error can cost you the whole effort and send you back to the last checkpoint so you'll need to be extremely cautious most of the time.Well, that sums up my complaints about this game. Now, it's time to talk about what this game does well. As a noir game, it's pretty competent.Atmosphere. From my perspective, atmosphere is the core of a noir game. The atmosphere is perceptible in this game, thanks to the background music and visual effects (most of the time). The somberness is there, I can feel it. After getting use to its awkwardness mentioned above, I had a good immersion playing this game and beat the last five chapters at one sitting.Decent story. The story of this game is not amazing but solid at least. Characters have their own personality and belief. However, it still falls short a little bit in my opinion. There're choices to make in dialogues, which is favorable to me. The ending is quite satifying as well (the ending may be slightly different depending on your last choice).Good narration and voice acting. I really like the voiceover and the voice acting of Wilt. Voice actings for other characters are fine, the accent can be too strong though.In general, despite its numerous flaws, I still enjoyed playing this game. For 7 bucks, it's worthy if you ask me."

76561198059861937,Recommended,316890,22786110,"Posted: 3 May, 2016",all,Mirus,"Calvino Noir lies somewhere between Mark of the Ninja for its side-scrolling, layered level structure and judgment calls of slay-or-spare under stealth, and Gunpoint, with its fedora-and-trenchcoat-clad spy/burglar. On top of these, Calvino Noir adds quite a decent bit of noir aesthetics. Voice acting is also quite good - no cringing sensation of a bad English accent or a worse German one (unlike horrors of, say, Blizzard VAs).As the name half-suggests, there is a profusion of noir themes of solitary private eye(-ish) protagonist, constant rainfall and muted colour palette. Not sure where `Calvino` comes into play - possibly referring to the Italian author of the same name for some reference or other.The game consists of seven levels, divided into three acts (3/2/2) and the player controls (eventually) three characters: Wilt, an English `scrambler`, (whose special ability is to choke enemies), Arno (who can operate machines) and Siska (picks locks and spies through keyholes). Each character possesses some common abilities, such as handtorches, which enables the player to collect hidden piles of coins that are used to upgrade character abilities.The gameplay is a bit of mixed bag - while straightforward in its layout and mission structure, the controls are not particularly comfortable. Abilties are keybound on Q (toggle walk/run), W (torch), E (Swap character) and they are the only keyboard-related input in the game. Navigation and interactions are bound to the mouse and this occasionally result in some difficulties like skipping cover zones while being pursuit (as the game uses checkpoints rather than saves, it might get frustrating at times). It may be different and perhaps better on a PS4, though.A minor issue is the lack of tooltips on certain parts of the game - character upgrades, for instance, feature two abilities and although it isn`t too hard to work out what they do, it wouldn`t be too difficult to put a tooltip anyway.Overall, it appears to be a decent, albeit perhaps a bit of niche title. Aesthetically (visual and audial) it stands out far ahead. In terms of gameplay, the aforementioned clunkiness may deter some, but in the long run these can probably be improved via devs, or simply be overcome by players."

A bit cliche at times, but the story by itself did hook me in, even if the characters themselves were a bit drab.The problems I had was with gameplay. Two things specifically. One was how the enemy guards worked. More than once, I died and had to start over again because a trigger-happy guard caught a glimpse of me from across the room and took me out immediately. The checkpoint system was frustrating becausw whenever I died, I wound up having to start over a long way from where I was. The hiding mechanic where your character hides behind nearby cover is very slow, it's hard to figure out where hiding palces are, and didn't work a lot of the time.The other was the buggy controls. It was hard for me to get my characters to do what I wanted them do: for example, I might tell my character to move close to the door and prepare for a takedown, but instead they open the door and get shot in the face.Probably the biggest problem I had with it was that the game doesn't explain anything: there's not much by way of a tutorial, so you're forced to learn through trial and error, which means that you die a lot of the time, rather than using a strategy to win. It also frustrates me that you have to juggle three people at the same time, whcih just makes it that much easier for a mission to go wrong because you forgot about one guy. Plus, there's only one player who can actually fight, which makes the other two seem totally helpless, unable to fight back if they get seen.I had really high hopes for this game, and if the developers had put some more effort into this, it probably could have been better. As it is, I feel like I got ripped off for $25 just to get killed over and over again."
