While they may have improved other parts of the game, the biggest part has remained largely unchanged.The things it does right are the visual effects and the sound. Definitely feels like an old kung fu movie by looking at it. Luckily you can toggle each of the options if you don't like them.Biggest thing it does wrong? The actual gameplay.The combat is horrible, just so stiff and clunky. Kung fu should be smooth and fluid, graceful almost. The game is not fun to play at all. If the clunky movements and animations were not enough sometimes the controls just don't work right.There are other issues, like the characters not quite looking human, but the biggest part of a fighting game (the fighting) is what ruins this game.I love Kung fu movies and to this day have lots of fun watching old ones I've never heard of. I know it's not popular anymore so it's even more rare for a game like this to exist. Sadly this was so disappointing I wish I never had bought it."

Bloodsport, Enter the Dragon, The Last Dragon for those that want to mix Kung Fu and break dancing.. which heck if you were alive during the 80's those were the two things which you loved...This game much like the 80's  an acquired taste.. it has some great classic characters....  an amazing sound track and the old grainy look will leave you busting out your breakdancing gear unfortunately the game play seems stuck in 80's right along with all these classic characters.The game isn't fluid at all, the trailers are downright misleading.  You'll never play the game as fluid and smooth as the trailers show.  The controls are stiff and slightly unresponsive..  The Hit detection seems to be at best flawed, sometimes you'll see your foot fly through someone face with no dmg... other times you'll hit thin air and see someone fly to the ground like a sack of bricks..  Also the AI is weak, you can win by using the same move or combo of moves over and over again..  Cheese factor is high in this one...If you want a good compaison think of the Original Mortal Kombat, this game's combat and character stiffness seems nearly identical if not slightly worse..  although button responsiveness MK has a massive leg up.   I won't say the game can't improve, but seeing as the Development team removed the Early Access and the last update aside from adding cards to the game was done about 3 months ago I'm pretty sure it's a safe bet the game won't be improved any longer.This just isn't a game I can recommend with a 9.99 price tag, if you can are a huge 80's kung fu flick type of guy.. it might be worth it just for some kicks and giggles, if you're a fighting game fan, you have far better choices for far cheaper prices.."

Also my game never played as smooth as showing in the trailers. Story too is non existant..The positive touch is naturally the homage to all the old fighting movies and their characters. The fighters have their different move sets (which isnt easy to execute, especially the combos) and each resemble some of the heroes of the cheesy martial arts flicks. From Bloodsport, to white hosed Chuck to the Cast of Enter the Dragon and so on.All in all this game is just like the old movies... cheap, cheesy and shouldn´t be measured by todays standards, but you can have some fun out of it, if you´re a fan."

First of all i wanna congratulate the small developing team for bringing such a game to life. Its really nice to know that there are so many passionate indie game developers that can offer so much for so little. Kings of Kung Fu is an original fighting game, based on old kung fu movies and the game itself couldnt be a more sheer tribute to those films. Now on to the game itself.The good stuff:1. Amazing nostalgia feelings for the old Kung fu movie era2. One of the greatest soundtracks i have ever heard, homage to those old movies style3. Full and interesting and everexpanding roster of characters based on real fighters (Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris!!!)4. Great level design and amazing details to make you feel like you are a part of a kung fu movie.5. Nice and easy gameplay, but hard to master.The bad stuff:1. Controls are not as responsive as they should be.2. Combos are hard to master3. Combat still has some bugs that need to be wiped out (you can win a whole round just by doing low right kick ^^)4. Graphics are really nice and polished, but for this day and age not the top quality i would like.5. No online multiplayerTo conclude, for me Kings of Kung fu is a really good game. It has some flaws, but considering the effort it has been made by a rather small team, i would say this is something most of us can pass through. For the most part its a really enjoyable game and you will have tons of fun playing either by yourself or with some of your m8s locally. At the moment there is no online multiplayer, so i know for a lot of you thats a turn off, but still it could happen in the future. If you like old Kung Fu movies and if you ever wanna see what it Feels like to be Bruce Lee facing Chuck Norris once more, buy this little gem ^^"

Maybe it does not shine graphics and today a very short history, but the atmosphere and the movement of characters is superb. Playing I did have the thought that I play for Bruce Lee. Here not only the movement, but also the nuances of each character. Inimitable atmosphere of the game. The picture is similar to the films of 70-80 years. Sounds just perfect. Whether it's hitting, or background music, which corresponds to a fighter. This game is a great fighting game for those who love these movies. I hope the developers will add more characters and make the story longer. But even now the game is good, though of course there is some imbalance between the characters And here it is possible again and again to arrange a fight between Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan."

Great characters.However all the potential that this game has to be awesome is utterly obliterated by the worst controls I think I've ever experienced in a fighting game. At one point I sat the controller on the floor and mashed it with my foot while replying to a text. I won more rounds that way than actually playing the game.I would have given this game a solid 7-8/10 but because the controls are so horrible...1/10 would not recommend.

But also being somewhat familiar with fighting games, I find playing it a chore.The jumping is unmanagable and forget about pulling off any air atacks.  Blocking also feels flakey and slow to get out of, leaving charcters backed into a corner by continuous attack strings.  I'm down for a more methodical, slower fighter, but I have to feel like I can control the character to enjoy it.Though there are some awesome moments here:  the feeling of weight and impact of strikes, how characters slap-block incoming attacks, also sound effects are pretty good. Also great golden harvest-esque into and shaw brothers style logo.Although unfortunately I can't recommend the game in this state.

Then suddenly... it was out of Early Access, in its highly incomplete state. Later, the devs put another fighter in Early, ""Shaolin vs Wutang"", which is basically an ""spiritual sequel"" of this game, and where all the improvements that this needed went. I'm all about supporting indie devs, but I will not do it if they want to start going full Capcom on us.If you want to support a very good, very balanced, fully featured indie fighter, go for Skullgirls; it's the same price as this but has a lot more features. You can also buy older AA/AAA fighters like Guilty Gear X2 #Reload, or wait for sales of MK9, Injustice 1 and specially the KOF series, which get incredibly cheap sometimes. PC has a lot of variety in fighting games now to accept weird behavior from devs."

It's a great style, but to be immediately pummeled the second you hit start is a bit excessive. The learning curve can be a bit harsh at times also.

Sad to say that this remains a thumbs-down and I'm afraid it'll stay like that. Bummer.Original ReviewDefinitely has something going for it. Though graphics aren't state-of-the-art, I very much like the overall style the game tries to get across. Film grain, flickering, filmstrip frames, fitting background music andall the great charactersfrom martial arts cinema (though no real names), each with their own fighting style. There's not much bells and whistles gameplay-wise and I like that simplicity. Directional controls and only left punch, right punch, left kick and right kick; that's it.The user interface also looks dated but works, so I don't really care much.What keeps me from giving this the thumbs-up is the overall gameplay itself: Controls are really bad (at least with a Xbox 360 controller, didn't bother playing with a keyboard) and oftentimes your character ends up doing things you didn't expect, e.g. dashing back or jumping instead of doing a ↓+←. Some combos often do not register or you need very weird timing to execute them and some simply do not work. Also, grabbing your opponent only works if you stand still. Why?In addition, hitboxes and hit registration are really bad and need work. I understand that Ron Jones is huge and has long legs and what not. But receiving a kick in your face whilst there's at least a 1 m gap between foot and face isn't funny.So in summary, I really want this to be good, it already provides some fun and has great style but the gameplay and controls are imho badly broken. For a fighting game this is fundamental. I hope this gets fixed.If you don't care about the technical issues, get it while it's on sale. Still a bargain."

Sounds are so terrible, that honestly I have to try remember, if I heard so bad sounds after year 1999.Gameplay was... well, press down and legsweep so you can't lose, you just time it right that is too easy. AI can't counter it. One funny old school ""stupidness"" is that somewhere in the tournament, player plays against same character. That's not big deal but it's just... funny thing.Characters moves was pretty cool, but characters was uninteresting. thats much about it.I paid -50% four euro's, it wasn't a big deal so yeah, if you want to give KoKF a try, go ahead but do not except much.

It's a tribute to Bruce Lee, Jacky Chan and many movies made by Shao's company.But I can't recommend this game on its current state(2.0 release):First, the control is clumsy and unstable. Comparing with other FTGs like DOA, Tekken and Street Fighters, characters jump and move way faster than in these games. It's pretty awful to see characters jump over and over like monkeys. That makes this game not like a FTG, more like a platformer.Second, the hitbox. Sometimes a punch far away from my character still hit, sometimes a kick crossed enemy's body missed. That made me feel confused.Third, the learning curve. Many other FTGs provides nood friendly characters like ChunLi in SF and Kazumi in DOA. In this game it's hard for a noob player to execute combos. It's hard to execute these awesome looking combos in video.I'm not a professional FTG player, but I still feel something's not right in this game. This game have potential, but needs polish."

Go!"" Not very compelling. Games like Soul Caliber and Street Fighter at least give you more than that~~~!- Character models: They almost all look like Jackie Chan during a battle. They have very nice pictures in the selection screen, but almost all of them look like Jackie Chan in some form or another, with an oddly proportioned face/head.- Mechanics: I couldn't get any of the moves to work, on the move list. At all. I was using an Xbox controller, so maybe it's just the support for controllers that is faulty, I'm not sure.- VOLUME: No way of changing the volume until the game starts up, which is awful for this game, considering it blasts the music and such as soon as you start it up. It's REALLY VERY LOUD, and actually scared me, although I was prepared for the game turning on.PROS:- Details: Detailed enough that everything looks pretty good, considering.- Straight forward: Though lacking a story, which is nice to have, the fighting is fairly consistent (regardless of the move list moves not working, in my case)- Typical: Feels like a typical fighting game, although a little bit on the lean side.======Would I recommend ""Kings of Kung Fu""?No, sadly, I can't... yet.If you get gifted it, it's good for a quick go.If it's on sale for next to nothing (as it was when I purchased it), I can't say it would be a total waste, because it's not terrible.But it's definitely not something to write home about, as of yet.If they improve the issues, polish it up a bit more, and fine-tune it before final release, then my rating may change :) There's something here, and it's definitely salvageable~"

I then downloaded and and tried to play it.  Thats where I turned it off after several matches.  My main issue were the controls (using an Xbox 360 control pad), they were so bad its difficult to explain.  I put this down to it being early access so uninstalled it and hve only just re-installed it but the controls are exactly the same using both a Steam Controller, an Xbox 360 and Xbox 1 controller.  I thought that this at least would have been resolved but was disappointed that it was the same, this is no only in-game but also i n the menus,  using the left stick I moved down to goto options and it jumped right past and sat on exit.  Maybe this was what I should have done.  Then after setting up the game with the very few options I played again.  The characters are not very fluent when moving, the overall finish on the game is very poor and I do understand they were going for an aged look to the game.Normally I won't write a review unless I have played at least 2 hours of a game, by then I will have a feel for the game and eventhough I won't have done much I will know what to expect.

The concept is cool and unique, and is the reason I bought it.But the execution of this game falls way short.1.) The A.I. is horribly broken.  On the hardest difficulty, the computer spams moves from full screen, and rarely ever blocks.  If you can knock them down, which is fairly easy, you can attack them as they wake up, and knock them back down.  Repeat forever and win.  With no online multiplayer, this is the only way to play the game aside from local co-op, and it makes the game not fun whatsoever.2.) Controls are laggy and unresponsive.  Fighting games thrive on good execution and balance to do well, and unfortunately this game doesn't live up.  There is a parry system, but it is difficult to pull of because of input lag.  If you perform a combo, it takes several seconds to show up on the screen.3.) I am worried about copywrite infrigement.  Not the characters themselves, as they (I believe) fall under parody law, but the blatant rip of voices from movies starring said actors.  This isn't so much of a complaint, but just a general worry.I hope this game receives some updates that fixes the glaring problems that it has.  I absolutely LOVE the concept, being a fan of kung fu movies, but this game is a broken unenjoyable mess.

I share the same thoughts that the previous reviewers say that it's a refreshing piece of work that gets back to basics to what a true fighting game is all about. The moments within the games does closely match the original actors in the original Kung Fu movies. I've been an avid player of Street Fighter all the way back to version 2 which still is one of my favorites just because it was simple and that your victories relies purely on skill with no fancy power ups. The atmospheric feeling of a old school film like effect that you have used within in the game feels both eerie and connecting at the same time especially with some of the actors who have passed away. The effect really does feel like you are actually playing in real Kung Fu movie with all its cheesiness and unique fighting styles which I feel has been lost over the years. The design team has really paid homage to the original movie franchise, unpolluted from other big gaming companies.I know there are a couple of bugs that needs to be looked after which is expected, but my experience so far with it has been a positive one having no crashes. Like the other reviewers has mentioned it seems to be a too easy to beat the computer which I guess will be adjusted for the final release. As far as the actors go, everyone looks alight except for Blood Sport guy whose face and hair looks a bit weird. Other than that everything looks great. As for suggested characters, maybe your team can look into the characters of one of the most popular Kung movies of all time which is the 5 Deadly Venoms. Thanks guys for making this possible, your team has truly made a masterpiece."

Thanks to Steam's new refund feature, I should be able to get my money back, and I hope I do.The controls in this game are simply unbearable. Combos are impossible to complete, not to mention just moving your character in the direction you want can seem impossible sometimes. The menus (although with great music) are unbearable to look at including the players move lists especially and the control menu. There's no tutorial so don't expect to be shown how to make this rocket-science-esque control scheme work. All in all, this game easily had the potential to be an awesome little arcade game that would be fun to play with friends who also enjoy arcade fighters such as MK, Tekken, SF, and others.

My console and PC library is littered with fighting games of all stripes - from NES to PS3 to Saturn and NEO-GEO CD. Most follow the traditional Capcom/SNK mold, with the occasional indy game. I stumbled on Kings of Kung Fu by accident and figured I'd spend some cash on an indy fighter to give it a chance - I was not disappointed.Kings of Kung Fu is climbing the charts as a favorite game of mine. It's not as smooth as it could be or polished. However, what it lacks in completeness, it makes up in atmosphere and character. The filter the game uses makes the game look like classic martial arts cinema. The cast is made up of homages to the heroes of the genre, with more on the way.When a developer pours in as much love as they can into a game, you can feel it. Kings of Kung Fu is one of those games; it has an intangible it that will draw in a core audience. The looks, character designs, soundtrack... those are the strengths.

Welcome to a special episode of A Bird's Eye View.  My name is Endeavor, and today we are revisiting Kings of Kung Fu.  It's been six months since I first reviewed this game, and now that it's out of Early Access, let's see how it holds up.The story mode in Kings of Kung Fu remains largely unchanged.  The player takes control of a stunt-person looking to become an action star.  A man named Red Ronin organizes a tournament that offers the winner that very opportunity.  All you have to do is defeat the other fighters.The playable characters are all obvious parallels to real-life actors from martial arts movies.  The roster has expanded to include fourteen characters.  Both the 2.0 and 3.0 patches added characters to the roster for free.  This bodes well for future updates considering that the New Fighter Request post in the forums is the most active thread in the community.  The diversity of the playable characters remains a strong feature, although the options for playable female characters is still fairly limited.If one was to make a list of this games best features, the atmosphere would clearly be at the top.  The stages are homages to iconic scenes and sets from various martial arts movies.  The bright and bold colors combine with music that ranges from funk to traditional to bring the player back to the golden age of kung fu flicks.  Everything is cheesy and over-the-top, and this game revels in it.Gameplay may be a sticking point for people used to triple-A fighters.  There are four attack buttons, and every character has a list of combos that can be strung together.  Hit-detection isn't always spot-on, and it can take some time to really get a feel for controlling your character.  Since the days of Early Access, there have been numerous fixes and tweaks to the gameplay.  Jumping attacks are much smoother now than they were in December, but they do still feel a little cumbersome.Controller support is included, but be warned that the controls were made with a D-pad in mind.  Players used to controllers with a joystick will have difficulties consistently doing quarter-circle attacks.  There was mention of a fix for this somewhere in the future, but this update is probably a ways off.One major complaint that users have with Kings of Kung Fu is the lack of online multiplayer.  This feature was talked about during Early Access.  At some point in time, Jae Lee Productions realized they would not be able to deliver, and all plans to include it in the final product were scrapped.  They have since apologized and pledged to work harder than ever on adding more characters and stages.One point I made in my last video praising Jae Lee Productions on their commitment to user feedback still stands.  Even after beta testing and months of Early Access, they are just as active as ever with their community.  The new fighters they've added for free were picked largely from suggestions by the players, and gameplay fixes are uploaded regularly.Kings of Kung Fu officially released on June 25th.  After six months, I feel that I can still recommend this game.  Despite its rough edges, there is a genuinely enjoyable product here that shows a lot of heart and commitment.  The retail price is $9.99, although the game frequently goes on sale.  It's available on Steam for Windows, Mac, and Linux.That concludes my follow-up review for Kings of Kung Fu.  I'd like to congratulate Jae Lee Productions for getting their game through Early Access.  And, of course, thank you for watching.

While I do find the game's character models to be very dated in appearance I'm by no means a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ and only care about gameplay.  I do really love the film grain and style of the game. As for the core game, it plays much better than I expected. Combos are easy to pull off and look very brutal. What I do have issue with is that the controller scheme doesn't allow use of analog sticks or to change button setup (they are backwards to me). Using the D-pad is an issue FOR ME, but maybe not for others. I found that trying to pull of moves with the D-pad was a hit or miss task for me most times. Luckily I own Xpadder and just mapped my own controller scheme, but hope that this will all be supported in game soon. The computer opponent A.I. is competent as any other fighting game when turned up a few extra difficulty levels. Characters are all recognizable to any martial arts film buff as are the stages they fight on. In a nutshell, for the price tag this game is very original and FUN and can only be better with friends. This is just an ALPHA. I can only imagine the content and features that this game will gain in the upcoming development period. Not perfect by any means, but so far so good in my opinion.

But ANYone who loves Kung Fu movies will understand this game is paying deep repsect and homage to the long lost days of low-budget Hollywood martial arts. And for that, all is forgiven. Hell, just having four generations of martial arts masters (Sho'Nuff AND Chuck Norris AND Donny Yen AND maybe somebody who kind of looks like Jet Li)  in the same game is cause for celebration by most contemporary Kung Fu fans.There IS a way to create a game that honors the legacy of cheaply made kung-fu movies, but because of controls and murky animation, this game somewhat misses the mark... but it's VERY much on the right path to kung fu grindhouse greatness.

Unfortunately, this is no Tekken. The problem starts with the premise, because everyone is based on real stars of martial arts movies they occupy a narrow range of body sizes, and there are no very large or very small characters, and the set of moves is much more plausible than most games of this type. But that means they're also more narrowly similar than most games of this type and this makes the gameplay feel much more samey.A better game might rise above this but Kings of Kung Fu occupies the cheaper end of the spectrum. Characters have relatively few special moves - which are relatively difficult to pull off - and these moves don't mix it up much when you do use them. Characters are typically very static during their moves and rarely advance making it hard to press attacks and this is probably what motivates the poor quality hit detection where moves often seem to hit without making contact. Much of the interest of movie martial arts sequences comes from sequences of blocking moves but there is little use of this in the game.All-in-all, it was probably worth a pound but it's hard to recommend as a fighting game."

Game even froze on me and just hung on a black screen!The animations are not fluid. When you hit the ground, your character resets its possition even it is about to punch or kick. I actually beat the whole game, picking one random character and doing the same quick punch through the entire matches (until it froze on me that is)."

It has a great cast of characters based on real martial artists such as Bruce Lee and Tony Jaa, each doing an alright job at replicating the fighting styles of those they're based off of. But this game just... isn't very fun. Early on, the game seemed to show promise even though it was rough around the edges, so I wanted to support it, but it just doesn't tap into the potential it has. I realized it needed a lot of work when I first played it, and stopped playing and gave it time because in that state, it was playable, but not too fun to play at all. Sadly, when I came back, I just couldn't find the interest in putting a lot more time in, because the game felt pretty much exactly the same as it did months and months prior. The sound design can be somewhat annoying, especially the sometimes incredibly obnoxious background noises on levels. There are moves that look like they hit, but don't, and moves that look like they didn't hit, but did. The story mode is so barebones, it's hardly worth playing more than once. Why not at least try to make it a big deal that these characters are coming across eachother (In Mortal Kombat X, even if two characters didn't exactly meet eachother, they would still have something to say to eachother at the beginning of the fight, to make it feel more personal, rather than just another fight). That IS one of the selling points of the game, I'd say. Plus, there really is a great cast of characters, great stages (such as the same place where Bruce Lee fought Chuck Norris in Return of the Dragon, cat and all, haha), and a soundtrack that kinda gives off that Wu-Tang vibe that could work with a game like this, but it just isn't enough. I'm a kung fu film fan, but I just don't find any interest in playing this game anymore than I already have."

From a pretty solid soundtrack to amazing blocking animations (and sound FX), you're basically playing a Kung Fu film. The characters are pretty recognizable ranging from Bruce Lee to Jim Kelly and the fighting styles feels just like what the game's story implies; 8 stuntment acting as their counterparts.Only issues so far is that the hit-box seems a little off at times, the music can get a little repetitive for some, and pulling off some moves feels a little clunky.

Though I admit that I am still very eager to see the roster expanded.Beautifully rendered stages reflecting sets  from iconic martial arts movies, heavily enriched my visual experience playing through the game. While, the use of ""dubbed over"" styled voices for the commentator, juxtaposed with old school kung fu sound fx fused with hip hop is a beautiful marriage of sound.A fighting game based on the heroes from old kung fu movies meshed together in a fighting tounament is a stroke of genius.

Also Bruce Lee was the first fighter I fought, in my opinion he should've been the end fight. Also timer runs to fast, the moves seem out of sync, some are slow and some you cant even see,  the ai needs work as sometimes they seem dumb and will stand far away and do moves, and then instantly they would become awesome fighters, like if you are winning the ai kicks into hard mode.. ???

I bought it on a whim and I am not disapointed.There is 12 characters and like...I dunno like 10 arenas to fight in.With a keyboard it's hard like any fighter. Though in SF and MK it's still easy to preform combos....in this the speed of the combat is so fast sometimes I don't know if I am preforming a combo or not.That is my only complaint.The atmosphere is greatThe film grain makes it look like a movieWhen combos do work it feels awesomeAchievementsI wrote this review right after I bought the game to say...it's well worth 2.71....believe me it is.One problem that some might find is there is no online multiplayer.

Played only a few minutes, but the controls feel way to unresponsive for a fighting game.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Currently the game has been polished a lot since the last review. Payed it yesterday for a bit and it (almost) feels like a triple A fighting game.There are only 3 points that I would like to mention that prevent it from reaching a perfect game:- The first is a lack of tutorial. Since the game has a lot of moves you can easily get confused if you don't play fighting games a lot. This isn't a deal breaker or anything, but it does mean that you have a higher learning curve than with other games.- A second point is that the combo's don't feel accurate. I have the feeling that I need to slow down my button presses, becaues if I press too quickly the game only registers the first button pressed.So say I want to press down, then right, then light punch. The game will execute a light punch as if I only pressed down when I press the buttons quickly.- The third thing is the roster. I feel there are enough fighters for the game to offer enough variety, but don't expect a roster like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat.These three points are minor issues I have with the game, so I do recommend buying it, but they should be taken into account since they have an effect on my/your enjoyment of the game.Something I didn't and cannot comment on is optimization. When I messed around with after my the last reivew I noticed the game became more responsive when the settings were put on low. Right now I can play on medium, but I didn't try to go higher, so keep this in mind.For reference, I can run Skyrim on ultry high, just like street figher, so my pc isn't/wasn't the problem.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thought I'd update my review again since quite some time has passed. About everything is pretty much as commented above, but I do find it necessary to mention that the start up screen of the game is black while it loads. This took me about 30 seconds to a minute.Do not panic if this is the case, just wait a bit and it should have started. The developers are aware of this and it seems that the reason is that the game loads almost everything at start up. So after the load screen at the start the game will not require to load all that much."

,Not Recommended,316930,17555168,"Posted: 15 August, 2015",all,Mega Missingno.,"Being the first fighting game to get ported to Linux, I really wanted to enjoy Kings of Kung Fu. But sadly, there is just nothing to enjoy here. For a diehard fighting game fan who has emulated everything I could get my hands on, this even manages to stand out as one of the worst I've ever played.Movesets are dull and uninspired, as the devs' insistence on realism means there are no projectiles, long range pokes, invincible reversals, mobility options, or anything you could think of that could make for interesting gameplay or matchups. You might as well just stick to your jabs up close and sweeps at range because there's not much else to do. And the input detection somehow manages to be worse than Street Fighter 1, there are a number of moves I simply cannot get to come out ever, and nothing I can do consistently.During Early Access the developers promised online, only to silently cancel this feature later. So without it you'll be stuck fighting very dull AI that will either stand there and let you hit them or abuse perfect reflexes. You'll find yourself falling back on just sweeping as they wake up over and over, since they don't understand what to do about that. Again, it manages to be worse than even the earliest fighting games and learn nothing from decades of evolution in the genre.Perhaps if you have a lot of nostalgia for the films that inspired these characters, you may get some amusement out of the fanservice. But if you came here looking for an actual good fighting game, look elsewhere."

The enemy/opponent AI seems pretty dumb, honestly I'm not even that good at fighting games and just enjoy them, but this game made me feel like I was ready to compete in EVO. It's too easy, the visuals are okay, and the SFX are quite grating (especially that one stage with the cat).Honestly, it was worth the sale price of like 2.75$, but I would advise against paying more than that since outside of the online multiplayer component, there's not much in this game to come back to after going through Story/Arcade Mode once."

Although, I have some suggestions for improving the game as follow:Characters1- The tao lung is not like to legendary bruce lee and he is very serious for bruce lee fan. Although, some his moves and roar  are similar. You must ignore the addiitional hair in front and end of his head, ignoring the hand cover like I saw in your previous trailer. Improve his eyes and his 3D view. The AI is weak and not realistic.The other fighters could be more look like as real characters . I hope one by one you add, necessary improvements and corrections for better  experience.Equipments1- Adding martial arts tools like nonchuk for bruce and ..., and dresses will go your game to brilliant.2- Adding fighter's opponents like classic movies, for example Han and Ohara in enter the dragon and ...In the end, I must tell you thank you very much for your enjoyable game."

No story, no bells and whistles, just straight forward combat!Sure this needs a bit of polishing but the game is actually a great idea and close to being a great compact fighting game. The moves and animations are close to authentic to those seen in the movies and true to actual styles.Once you start seeing combos put together it lookes great... none of this fireball throwing mystical spell casting nonsense you get with some fighting games.Its cheap, its being developed and for what this game and dev is trying to achieve I think its great!Dev feedback:Bit better GFX optimisation to smooth out animations.Sort out the distance with attacks as you can hit the other person when not even in reach.Other than that keep doing what you are doing :)Well done nice little project and was happy to pay a few bucks for it!

I would also like to model a scene that could be used in further patches if possible.  I have a Bachelors of Science in Game Art and I'm always looking to make some environments.

It's not the deepest fighter, but definitely not brainless either. I had fun playing through the Arcade Mode  on Very Hard and correctly identifying whether the CPU was going to attack high or low. You can maintain spacing and punish whiffed attacks with awesome looking combos, and of course iconic signature kung fu movesets.A few small gripes I had with the game were the easy jab combos. It's possible to land once and time the next jab to connect an 11-hit whopper easily. Damage scales, but still. Also, I think the achivements may be buggy. I played well over 100 games against my 8 year old niece (winning at least 120 accumulative not consecutive), but the achievement didn't unlock. It is in fact listed as 100 CONSECUTIVE won games, but who plays 100 games in one sitting?Either way, as a huge martial arts film fan, this game is pretty fun and definitely worth checking out."
