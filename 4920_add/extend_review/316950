I finally managed to kill the first enemy, and then the game would end for some reason. Superman 64, E.T for the Atari 2600, Ghostbusters on the NES, ALL of those games are better than this wack♥♥♥♥♥piece of software. Why does Gabe Newell allow this kind of crap on the Steam Store? He's gotta be smoking crack. Just take that pocket change and get yourself a gumball out of a machine, as you'll have a better time chewing it, than playing this game, as well as saving yourself a few cents, LOL."

This game must have been made by a couple of kids... Nope. For some reason two ADULTS made this game together.., How did they even manage to make a game this bad? How is this even on steam!?!? Its $4.50CDN and they expect you to buy it?! The game looks absolutely horrible for 2014. And don't tell me that its difficult to make those graphics with only two people cause I could do it all in one day! I don't think theres one person in the entire world that could possibly complete the first level only because of how choppy and glitchy the gameplay is! Don't buy it, just dont! I got it for $0.50CDN on sale and I still regret the purchase! I could have bought a nice looking skin for Counter-Strike if I known it was this bad. If it ever becomes free-to-play, get it, it'll at least make you laugh because of how horribly bad it is."

,Not Recommended,316950,31484280,Posted: 1 May,all,Verdantil,"Tags: Tactical - Squad - MilitaryAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from LibraryTLDR: Broken. Trash.Outstanding Issues : Options in the menu are broken, cannot switch resolution without crash. Opening the credits showed the developper's photos and what is, assumedly, their real names, or maybe the developper is trying to shame someone they hate either way not a good idea. After the credits closed the game started at Mission 6. I did not know how to use the game so I died and went back to the menu but it crashed. I restarted the game and I noticed that all loading screens have those weird green dots all over the background, they have large Comic Sans font lettering, takes forever to load. I managed to identify a shortcut from the keyboard so I pressed it when mission 1 loaded and I got a black screen. By then I was 3 minutes into the game so I idled 2 more minutes so I could write the review."

Vastly underrated, this game brings tears to my eyes. The undying passion it must have took to create such a gem is unbeknownst to common folk.

The camera doesn't follow the player, the bombs crashed me and the enemies can shoot me but I cant shoot them, the translation is amazing. I mean, it clearly states ""click for play""! I unfortunately cannot continue to play this amazing work of art due to the fact that the graphics are too good, so good infact I'm afraid that I might confuse this game with real life an attemp to shoot someone while there's a big NO sign in the way."
