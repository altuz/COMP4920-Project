At the time this wasn't included in the pack, which made me sad because I had very fond memories of playing this game as a kid. Thinking back on my childhood, it's probably my 3rd favorite HE game, falling short only to SPY Fox in: Dry Cereal and Pajama Sam 2: Thunder and Lightning Aren't so Frightening. When I saw this game had been added to the pack and I had it because I had the pack (or maybe it had just been made Mac compatible, regardless, I saw I could download it) I was absolutely thrilled because I had just been lamenting over not having this game.While I don't think this would be a particularly interesting game for most adults, there's massive nostalgia value for me and playing it now threw me back to when I played it as a kid. I had a ton of fun and it was like a trip back to my childhood!I would definitely recommend it if you either A. played it as a child and have fond memories or B. have young children and want games for them. Actually if you have children and can afford it, I'd reccommend buying the entire Humongous Entertainment pack as there's hours and hours of entertainment value in there in pretty simple games originally made for kids to play!It takes me about 45 minutes now as an adult to get through most Humongous Entertainment games I played for hours as a kid, but as a kid it took me a lot longer, I remember getting very immersed and they had a lot of replay value! I would absolutely recommend this game and virtually any other game from Humongous Entertainment along these lines for anyone with younger kids.(They're not boring as an adult either, in my opinion, if you want to sit with your kid and help them play or play with them!)"
76561198088380930,Recommended,317030,20109524,"Posted: 30 December, 2015",all,emasterslake,"Fatty Bear was one of the more obscure characters from the Humongous Game catalog. He never received any sequals excluding one spin-off game made afterwards. The game focuses on a toy bear named Fatty who is a cross between Winnie the Pooh and Teddy Ruxpin voiced by Scott Burns(Bowser from the Mario Bros. games) who prepares a birthday surprise for his owner Kayla along with the help of other toys to set up decorations and a cake. The game isn't as exciting as the other Humongous Games, but it was highly playable so I won't be too hard on it. I couldn't imagine there being more games on Fatty Bear, cause he's not a cool and suave hero like Spy Fox, not a mystery solving fish like Freddi Fish, not an imaginative kid like Pajama Sam. He's just a kind hearted toy bear who resembles other toy bears you would see in other medias. Though the game is worth introducing to your kids, but just don't expect it to be an ultra classic is all."

,Recommended,317030,27382056,"Posted: 24 November, 2016",all,DigitSo,"Wow, I think that this game is for the nostalgic persons like myself who played this as a kid. It made me go way back in time and it was great. Althought I would still suggest it today as a simple game if the child is more of a visual learner.Story - You are Fatty Bear: a magical being comming to life at night to prepare the best birthday of your best friend, Kayla. With the help of her other toys, you have to prep the balloons, the decoration and best of all, bake and decorate her birthday cake!Gameplay - It's mostly a point & click adventure/discovery game when you have to walk around the house to find all the ingredients for the cake and the decoration. There are some puzzles involves and some backtracking to do but it's mostly straight forward. There is also a bowling game which is not at all related to the story. I think the best aspect of it all is the interaction. In every rooms, there is a ton of objects that have a fun little animation that makes the thrill of the search more interesting.Graphic & Sound: There is not much to say here. I think that for it's age, it's a good looking game. Colors and objects are well defined. Animations are plenty, fun to watch and are very varied. There is not much dialog in the game but it's entirely voice acted. There is also a piano mini-game with pre-made popular lullaby. You can even make your own little song!In all, it's a very short and simple game. As an adult, it took me about half an hour to complete but I guess it would take more time for a kid. After 23 years, this game is still as fun as I remembered it and I'm glad I had the chance to relive that adventure!!"

It is still as charming as ever (although shorter than I remember!). Pure nostalgia. I definitely recommend this game for small children or anybody longing to wear a pair of rose tinted glasses and take a strole down memory lane. Fatty Bear is a straight up G.
,Not Recommended,317030,32055354,Posted: 29 May,all,DefaultGen,"About half of this game is making a cake and almost all of the ingredients are just in kitchen cabinets or the fridge. Games should take you on an adventure. Putt Putt goes to the moon, joins the circus, and saves the zoo. This game is just really mundane compared to other Humongous games and the small cast of insufferably polite characters is the worst.Stick to the other Humongous games that have at least a little personality and excitement to them."

The main attraction is Fatty Bear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Fatty Bear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!Can you survive five nights at Fatty's?10/10 #2spooky4me"

,Recommended,317030,35156401,Posted: 23 September,all,Eastine,"Fatty Bear is quite possibly the greatest MOBA/Point and Pinch/Psychological Horror game on the market right now. I recommend this game if you are coming from a game that requires serious mechanical aim like GMOD and Wild Animal Racing. It's quite hard to play the bowling mini game without any mechanical aim naturally because of the spray patterns of the ball. Also the cake baking is a little touch when you can't hit your shots. Please keep in mind this is one scary game. The dog monster you unleash and have to contain has a few jump scares. Like when he comes out of the box, so children and special needs people beware!!! It's pretty spooky. The Moba characters in it are pretty balanced, except for mom and dad, they are over powered pieces of♥♥♥♥♥♥(Humongous Ent. nerf please). The community could be less toxic as well, they yell things at me when I am trying to find all of the letters."
