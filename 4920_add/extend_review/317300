,Recommended,317300,13655641,"Posted: 27 December, 2014",all,jennabun,"I thoroughly enjoyed this quirky dating sim! I'll break down what I consider to be the pros and cons of the game (seriously though, the pros definitely outweigh the cons.)Pros:+ Sometimes visual novels/dating sims suffer from an excess of boring, mononous text. Thankfully, this one does NOT! The writing is fun and engaging, and the scenes aren't unnecessarily long.+ The characters are unique and pretty realistic, each with their positive and negative traits. I thought they all added flavor to the story.+ Options for queer romance!!! <3 For my first playthrough, I played as Anne and romanced Isabella... the storyline was simultaneously adorable and sultry.+ Playing on normal difficulty, the game felt well-balanced. The stats DO matter and you definitely have to think about how you plan your week. The choices make a huge difference too. However, I never felt completely overwhelmed. Basically, the game is not *that* hard, but it isn't a cakewalk, either.+ The animation is very cute and the game is aesthetically-pleasing overall.+ Replay value definitely is there, since there are two characters to play and four romance paths for each.Cons:- Sometimes that guitar theme song that plays in the background gets really annoying. I think it's a song that's too loud/overwhelming to be playing on loop during some of the scenes.- I would have liked more art. The only scenes you see drawn out are the two BIG romance scenes you earn (one during spring break and one at the end of the game). There are plenty of other romantic/funny scenes during the game that would have been amazing to actually see instead of just imagine.- I wish there were more queer romance options (No Anne x Sally!?!?! *pouts*)If you like dating sims, I encourage you to give this game a whirl! It is sure to entertain!"

It has pretty cliche characters, but each one has a different side to them if you get to know them better.  It's nothing mindblowing, you won't find a lot of earthshaking literature here but it's entertaining and stays entertaining.There's two playable characters, one male and one female with four romance paths each for a total of eight paths.  Two of those paths are same-sex paths.  The stat system and picking your schedule is very gamey and doesn't do much except artificially close off the ""good"" endings if you do it wrong.  Basically you pick out a character you want to romance and only pick activities that are associated with the stats they apparently like.  There's no consequences for never raising any of the other stats except the two you need.  I guess you can care about grades too, but you can just study in the time blocks where your chosen stat activities aren't available.  The so-called bad boy I played that wanted to drop out of college was a top student, while still getting the girl and finding time between the sexual tension to front a band.It's a neat little story, but like I said it's not going to be an intellectual roller-coaster and it's not meant to be.  Roommates is a VN about light comedy, light romance and sweet character interaction.  You won't find a lot of philosophy, but you'll find some nifty references, a few laughs and enough sweet/cute scenes to give you diabetes."

Like other games in the genre you decide for each part of the day what you want to do, which increases or decreases certain statistics.A great feature in this game is that you can schedule the week planner ahead of time, rather than needing to decide each day (part) again what you want to do next. And you can also change this at any time.The daily routine is interrupted by events throughout the week, which mainly serve to advance the story and your relationship with the other characters.The writing is hilarious at points and Roommates has a good rock soundtrack.Some minor gripes I have are that there is very little animation other than characters sliding in and out, and that it isn't always clear what your chosen response will lead to. At times I picked what I thought was a flirting response only to have my character say something completely inappropriate, destroying their relationship with the character I was pursuing at the time.Very unique to the genre, Roommates has both girl chasing boy, boy chasing boy, and homosexual relationships included. Because of this there are multiple endings and many choices in this game really matter.Overall this is a highly impressive VN."

Seriously, I want a Dominic in my life XD you can choose to play as Anne or Max; each of them has four romance options.The writing is legit good (only flaw I think is when Isabella and Max interact and use those cringey nicknames)! The romance and your college life intertwine well, and you can even influence how characters will do after college with your choices, which is great because they all matter.The art has a nice crispy flare to it; the CGs are made by a different artist I think, but they still look cute (or sexy, wink wink).The sountrack is great and conveys the mood perfectly. The Halloween track is my fave!The simulation part I was afraid of is actually intuitive and pretty nice, with three levels of difficulty (if you suck at it like me just select the easy one and you'll be fine).Final verdict: great for both seasoned fans and neophytes of the genre :)"

I say comedy, because the thing is filled with funny moments, and even the few serious moments are tinged with some snark. You can choose to play as Max, a rebellious sort that is in college to make a name for his band and break out into the world, or as Anne, a sheltered bookish girl looking to break out of her shell. Besides being able to pursue a romance with the other potential PC, there are four other potential partners. Domenic is exclusive to Anne, while Sally is only available to Max, while Rakeesh and Isabella are available to both.Truthfully, the relationships that feel the most likely are the pairings between Max and Anne, with Domenic-Anne and Sally-Max close behind. There is an interesting system in place to gather relationship points as well as money and grades (you are at college and your parents might want a return on their investment!)."

It’s REALLY expensive, the writing and characters are cliche, and it gets quite boring after one or two playthroughs. But I have to give it some credit for the fact that you can play as a male or a female MC. I found that interesting, and also the fact that there are two bisexual characters. Overall, I only recommend this game on a good sale and for players who are already used to Winter Wolves games. If you don’t like status raising system in VNs, don’t get this.4/10."

You can even choose to be in a homosexual relationship if you want, which is pretty nice. I wasn't a fan of the art at first but I got used to it pretty quickly. Also, some of the characters seem a bit annoying at first but they grow on you as the game progresses.

It popped up in my queue and I added it to my wishlist when I saw it was $25, not wanting to spend that much on it. I bought it when it was on sale for $15, figuring it was worth it if it was so expensive for a visual novel. Unfortunately, I was not all that impressed with the game. The characters were okay; their personalities were pretty shallow and they all fit into a stereotype. It is impossible to romance the person you want on your first play through because you spend so much time figuring the scheduler out before realizing how to utilize it to gain enough points in the right fields to romance the character you want (or I suppose I could just be a dumbass). The story isn't very interesting in my opinion and there's not much variability in it, unless you just skip every event.Outside of that, the replay value is decent because there are so many routes you can take, but the story doesn't really differ much in each one, so it sort of ruins the point of it.I would not spend more than $5 on this game. It was not worth what you're being charged for just to get a mediocre story with little variability in it between the different romance options."

The art work is a major improvement, The dialogue and plot alters slightly depending on who you romance, it's funny, good music and it has some moments that just made me want to 'squee'. It also has achievements for each of the ends and CG scenes. Which, is another thing about this game, you can pick between male and female.This game was so worth $25."

I banked about 6 hours for one route, although naturally you will spend less time on your subsequent routes unless you want to reread everything. The writing is entertaining and well done. It isn't an epic multi layered story but it isn't meant to be either. The choices you make matter but only a few of them will mess up your romance route, and of those most are easy to discern. It's best to stick with one romance partner from the get go unless you don't want a romance ending (you can still get a satisfying ending while not romantically ending up with anyone). You can play as a male or female and both of them have distinctively different personalities. For each protagonist there are 3 opposite sex options and 1 same sex option. The music in the game is good and catchy (at least a couple of tracks I would listen to for fun outside of the game), although there were a few oddly silent parts that I wish had some music. The art is great and is anime-styled. Romance scenes get to the edge of where underwear comes off, and then is a ""fade to black.""I would suggest taking a peak at the guide for this game (on steam) so you get the best ending for your romance choice the first time through. It's not very spoilery. If you INSIST on not reading it, I would suggest making sure to make sure to get affection points in every scene with the character you want to romance (go back and test the options, etc) and focus on their associated stats (you can find out by clicking on the ""stats"" button) to the exclusion of almost everything else. To romance Anne (who I went with) you need to keep your grades up, too. MAKE SURE to get to have enough rest while preferring actions, if you dip below about 70% your stat increases diminish greatly. Skip events that don't involve your intended romance partner (if you're not sure, save and then test out the event)  so you get more rest. It's fast to replay the game because of the handy skip feature so don't worry about wasting too much time. Plus you get to save at any time, and I would recommend saving a lot, there are plenty of save slots too. Also ask on the forums if you need any help.This is another good Winter Wolves VN and I look forward even more to their future games. If you not sure or are new to VNs, get the game on sale."

However, I bought this when it was 50% off which feels like the right price range for it. Still, during my experience with it, I enjoyed the first route I went through. Then after that, I grew exponentially bored with this game with each consecutive route to the point where I was holding the ctrl key the whole time.There’s nothing outstandingly bad about this game other than the fact that losing in this game is easy to do. You are only shown the stat conditions to winning, but there are other instant-failure conditions that the game leaves ambiguous to the player. And the worst part is that you don’t know that until your love interest rejects you late in the game.Still, I recommend this game due me probably being in the minority of the people whom bought this game liking dating sims but dislike stat management. The story is good with a lot of comedic moments and the characters are all well made. If you haven’t bought this game yet, I recommend buying this on sale."

First, we are shoved into the life of one of the two protagonists, both of them being very stubborn in their role and - for me - very hard to even care about in the slightest. There is not much of a story going on, which I expected from the description - but I defiinitely expected more from the romance options at least. Everything that happens feels very rigid and unnatural, and I couldn't get myself to care about any of the available romance options. There are tons of better visual novels out there, and they tend to be much cheaper than this. Honestly, if the price wasn't so high, I wouldn't be this disappointed. I loved Tales of Aravorn, but this... Anything that's 20$+ should meet certain standards. This game doesn't."

The girl everyone seems to find endearing, and I agree.  The story was simple, but enjoyable.The 'stat raising/scheduling' part threw me off and doesn't feel like it adds much to the game, but I mostly play for the story anyway.  Just make sure you REALLY look at everything before you make choices: I was trying to get a romance ending and figured out, oh, I need to build certain stats that I ignored the whole way through.The price still feels high at $25, I would wait for a sale... but I always wait for a sale.

The characters are all fine, and the stories are pretty good; I particularly appreciated that relationships progress at a believable pace.That being said, the time management aspect of the game feels unbalanced.  I liked having to balance studying and raising your other stats with resting.  But forcing players to make an explicit choice between resting and experiencing the plot seems like a bad decision.  Furthermore, some of the characters are effectively easier to romance than others, simply because of when you can do certain activities or take certain jobs.That also affects the replayability of the game.  If you are playing as Max and want to romance Anne (a decision, by the way, which needs to be made in Week 1 if you have any hope of doing so successfully), you can only do jobs that raise the appropriate stats on three days each week, and there are only five time periods in which you can do leisure activities that she will appreciate.  And so, you do all of them--because you need every last one of those particular stat points you can get.  Really, then, the only interesing game play is what percentage of the time you study vs. rest--and there isn't a lot of depth there.It's not a bad game:  if you like Dating Sims (especially dating sims with non-traditional gender pairings), then you'll probably like this one.

Especially after Sally gave that speech about running early in the morning.That Male Teacher was hilarious.I would have liked to see more art: Different poses, different clothing, different facial expressions.It would have been interesting to see them at work dealing with different situations - perhaps getting bonuses?Even with school work.The ending portion was sweet if you made the requirements. However, it left the flash back of ""where are they now"" feeling lack luster. It would have been nice to see visually where they ended up.Overall, I enjoyed myself and look forward to more games by Winter Wolves."

If you're looking for deep characters or story, don't bother. However, if you're looking for some laughs and just some feel goods, then I highly recomend it.The characters are mainly stereotypical college students. You've got the studious bookworm Anne. The rocker/troublemaker Max. The tightwad dormrep Dominic. The sexy party girl Isabela. The artist Rakesh. and the ""friend of the earth"" Sally. And while they are mostly stereotypes, they do have just enough depth to keep them from getting annoying. Also, one bonus for this game, is that when/if you romance some one, the rest don't disappear. All through the game you are given MANY chances to interact with your roommates. However, if you don't like one of them, you can just skip their interactions. Also, all members of Latin House are romaceable, though not all at once. For both potential main characters has four romance options(yes that includes the other potential protag.)The gameplay, while having your traditional visual novel choice making, also has some stat. management where you plan out your character's week. In this you need to balance your grades, social life, and rest(kinda like the real thing). you also need to build certain stats associated with your chosen romance option. Each has two, a primary and a secondary. Get the stats to certain levels at certain checkpoints in the game and you get the full romance. Also, one thing that isn't completely explained in the game, is that both Anne and Max have a goal that they want to acheive by the end of the year. While the game does tell you when you need to start working towards it, you need to figure out the details on your own.As for the music, if you don't like the song in the trailer, either don't buy the game or play it on mute. Cause they play the song in the game alot. And the rest of the music is along the same lines.Hope this all helped/made sense."

But I don't care because I can't remember the last time a game like this has made me so damned happy.Beyond that, I honestly love every single one of the characters.  Even dull-witted obnoxious Max, spacy vegan Sally, stuck-up Dominic, and goofball Rakeesh (Anne and Isabella are great, and my favorite couple).  The game was probably a terrible dollar/hour value, but I don't care.  If you're harboring a secret (or not-so-secret) emotional side when it comes to these sorts of things, get this game NOW.Disclaimer:  I may have been slightly inebriated when writing this, but I'm practically tearing up nonetheless damn it!"
