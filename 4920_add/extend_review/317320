Top notch production (with SUPERLATIVE voice acting and music), great puzzles and design, and wonderful story/characters with some of the funniest dialogue from a videogame yet. A must-play for any fan of this genre!EDIT: Just now officially completed the game, lemme tell you BIG SMILE ON MY FACE! I will say at around 5 or so hours it's a bit short, but in my own personal opinion it's better to go short than to outstay your welcome. This is gonna go down as one of my top of 2016 for sure, and I CANNOT WAIT for the next Nelly Cootalot game, fantastic effort all around, pick this game up today!"

The puzzles so far are logical and the humor is great. The graphics are well done, it runs really well on Linux and the voice acting is very engaging, particularly Nelly and Sebastian. 9/10 so far.Update: I completed the game after about 8 hours. Its a really fun game with lots of humour and a good story. The voice acting is really well done throughout and the hand drawn graphics suit the game and fit well with the story. Right clicking on all the clickable items results in some very funny descriptions. I would have liked the game to be longer, its a bit short and could be completed in about 6 hours if you don't fully explore all the areas. It has some replayability as the achievements are all actually achievable, so I will play through again to get the ones I missed.Overall an enjoyable adventure game that would have been even better if it had a few more areas to explore and was a bit longer. 8/10."

Another issue is that mouse clicks only work when the mouse is perfectly still, which means any small movement of the mouse makes the game not register your clicks (especially happens if you use the Steam controller to emulate the mouse).Works fine on Linux."

,Recommended,317320,22105791,"Posted: 28 March, 2016",all,thekelvingreen,"First things first, I should mention that one of my friends was involved in the production of this game -- and voices a pompous sea bird -- and I've spent an afternoon playingBombermanwith both the creator of the game and Nelly Cootalot herself, or at least her inspiration and voice actor.Nelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleetis a comedic point and click adventure game about pirates. If you are now thinking ""Gosh, that's a bit like deciding to be a sprinter and challenging Usain Bolt to a race your first time out"" then that's a bit weird that we both thought of that, but you'd be correct. The shadow ofMonkey Islandlooms large over this game -- now I'm imagining a Lovecraft pastiche;The Shadow Over Monkey Island-- but not only does the script acknowledge the influence, Nelly Cootalot is strong enough to stand up to and apart from its illustrious predecessor.The writing for the most part is strong, and the characters' personalties come across well, helped in no small part by good voice acting throughout. Nelly herself is a charming protagonist; everyone seems to like her, and her cheerful approach to adventure is infectious. The main villains are a bit sketchy, and not in the appropriate sense of the word; I think they return from the original game in the series, but as I've not played that, their motivations and personalities seem a bit vague in this instalment. A new villain introduced in the middle section of the game comes across far better, although again his motivations and connection to the main plot are somewhat unclear. Still, it's Nelly and her friends who are most important and they are well-written and acted; aside from Nelly herself, I was most impressed by her sidekick Sebastian, voiced by Tom ""Warhammer 40,000: Fire Warrior"" Baker. To be honest, I was expecting someone of Sir Tom's prestige to sleepwalk through his role but he brings a lot of personality to Sebastian, even though he has one of those voices that means you can never quite forget that there's an actor behind the character.The game is funny, and there's a varied approach to the jokes, with plenty of references to films and games, a bit of witty wordplay, a dash of satire here and there, and at least one bit of smutty innuendo, although that last one doesn't land as well as it could have due to some clumsy back-pedalling. Some comments and reviews have claimed that the game is for children -- perhaps because of the art style -- but the latter joke suggests not, and some of the references are going to go right over the heads of most kids, unless they are showing Jack Nicholson films in primary schools these days.The game looks good too. The trailers did look a bit ropey, with a flat animation style reminiscent of Flash or a cheap CBeebies programme, but the game itself looks much better. The character models look to be cel-shaded and that gives them a bit more weight, and they are for the most part well-animated; it is a bit of a shame that they don't tend to do anything when Nelly isn't interacting with them, but one has to remember that this isn't a multi-million pound game with a hundred-strong creative team behind it. That said, it's a pleasant surprise when you spot a character making a small movement or gesture that must have added time to the production schedule and is irrelevant to wider game, but helps to bring the character to life. It shows a dedication and craftsmanship that you don't often see in the aforementioned larger productions.I did encounter a couple of graphical glitches; during one part of the Guttering Howls section Nelly walks in front of and through something she should be behind, and in the penultimate chapter the inventory panel goes a bit wonky, but is still usable. I also had a bit of trouble with the game's interface being slow to register what was under the pointer, although the mechanics worked as expected, so it wasn't a major issue. I played the game on Linux Mint 17.3 and I don't know if these glitches are in every port.Heh, ""port"". Like sailors. Heh.Nelly Cootalot's puzzles are varied and often require different approaches and techniques to solve; even when they are of the give-item-A-to-person-B sort, they are at least presented in novel ways so the game never gets dull. In terms of difficulty, the puzzles are if not simple, then logical, so you are never hunting for rogue pixels or throwing every item at every character, hoping for the best.That said if there is a flaw inNelly Cootalot-- and to be fair, it is the only thing I would consider a proper flaw -- it's the wider game and story logic surrounding the puzzles. On a few occasions I worked out the solution to a problem, and had all the correct items in my inventory ready to go, but I couldn't apply said solution because I hadn't gone to talk to someone -- often in another location -- who was supposed to give me the idea I'd already had. This led to frustration and -- in one case near the end of the game -- a suspicion that there was a game-breaking bug. On the plus side, Sebastian is able to give hints about what to do next, and in at least one case this helped resolve the impasse, although in the latter instance I did end up roaming around clicking on everything and everyone until I spoke to the right person.Creator Alasdair Beckett-King is a jolly nice fellow -- and is not bad atBomberman-- but it turns out he's quite good at making computer games too. I had great fun playingNelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleetand although it is short -- it can be completed in about five hours or so, although getting the Steam achievements will take longer -- I think it is worth the £12 I paid for it. There are rough edges, and places where I feel Alasdair and his team could have done a tiny bit more, but what's here is good, and I hope the game is enough of a success that we see more from him.If you like point and click adventure games, give this a try because you'll probably ike it. If you don't, give it a try anyway, as it's charming and funny and may change your mind."

,Recommended,317320,26185472,"Posted: 23 October, 2016",all,apocalyptech,"Nelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet is a delightful adventure game with fantastic humor, a surprisingly large cast of characters (with great voice acting), and puzzles which are, indeed, quite fair.  What difficulty there is generally just comes from the game's ""main"" middle area which is the largest, and simply has an awful lot to explore and look through before you can get a good handle on what your goals are.  If you ever do feel at a loss for what to do, the game thoughtfully allows you to ask your sidekick Sebastian, who will provide some pointers.  It's a great touch.  The game follows the Lucasarts philosophy of adventure games, so it's impossible to get into a no-win situation.The main draw really is the humor, and the excellent delivery with which the lines are generally given.  Tom Baker, as Sebastian, is of course great, but Nelly Cootalot herself is voiced flawlessly, and it was a treat to have her as the protagonist.  There were many times I laughed out loud (for real!), and many lines I couldn't resist sharing with friends.Anyway: highly recommended if you enjoy this kind of adventure game.  I'm looking forward to any more Nelly Cootalot adventures which may find their way to release!"

I had a lovely time playing Nelly Cootalot, and unlike a lot of adventure games I've played, all the puzzles were logical and straight-forward. So much so, that I didn't need to refer to a guide at all during my play-through, which is unusual for me when I play these kinds of game.Plus it has Tom Baker in it (amongst the excellent voice cast) - so what other reason do you need to buy it ;)"

You are a pirate named Nelly and inspired by games like Monkey Island sail for adventure to rescue kidnapped birds. The graphics are good and the sound/music is ok. The voice over is good and the puzzles are simple.This game will not be a classic or a legend however it is a good and fun way to spend a few hours. Even kids can play it.
,Recommended,317320,28998525,Posted: 3 January,all,James20,"Best part of this game is the ending song, but that's because it’s really great ending to a solidly great game.  No mind blowing puzzle difficulty, but several chuckle worthy moments and classic point and click game play. Oh and Tom Baker provides voice acting, that’s pretty awesome.Nelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet is the sequel to a free game that was released quite some time ago. I didn't realize that while playing the game until I Googled. There are several moments in the game that allude to the previous game in some way, such as the opening.  That said you really don’t need to play the previous game to enjoy this one, only know that a world and characters already exist.The game channels much of Secret of Monkey Island unabashedly. It’s even brought up in game.  That’s okay. Nelly Cootalot takes similar world and works with its own themes. There’s not a lot swashbuckling, mostly fetching drinks and food for people, also insurance fraud. The game goes for the same zany if it puns it works logic that Monkey Island did, but it doesn’t go nearly as far as they did. (Anyone remember the Monkey Wrench?)Puzzle are pretty simple, a no point did I feel the need to search for hints. Many puzzles are pun related, some are just fetch quests, nothing that requires deep thought.  If anything, the simplicity of the puzzles is the weakest point of the game, but not so bad as to not recommend it.The voice acting is solid, with Tom Baker standing out far ahead of the rest. While he is does have a major roll, it’s in the form of a hint/helper.  Aside from a handful of puzzles, you really don’t need to speak to his character often. Hints just aren’t that necessary. I found myself interacting with the character just cause.There was 1 minor bug, hotspots would stop working randomly. Not a huge issue, but could make completing achievements trickier.Overall, a great game, simple but with a lot of love and care put into it."

76561197981087618,Recommended,317320,29577699,Posted: 29 January,all,ThrowntoReality,"Nelly Cootalot is a point-and-click adventure game where you star as an amateur/ferocious (??) pirate named Nelly.In short, this game is very much like a long lost ""Monkey Island"" sequel that was never released. Nelly could well be Guybrush's and Elaine's daughter, if they ever got one. She's got Elaine's red hair and attitude, and Guybrush's witty and quirky sense of humour. Like the latter, she wants to be a pirate, but is absolutely clueless about how life at sea works.The humour is the best part of the game. It's witty and, once again, resembles Monkey Island in almost every aspect, though with a few twists. The graphics are gorgeous. Everything is hand-drawn and incredibly detailed. You can stare at the backgrounds for minutes, over and over, and still notice new things each time you come back. The characters are fun and memorable (highlights include a Dylan-wannabe busker and a great, spooky villain by the name of Van Zandt). The soundtrack is above average and fits very well with the game.The puzzles are well-balanced. It's fun to figure out what you're supposed to be doing and they're never too difficult. It may take some time to realize what you're supposed to do sometimes, but most of the time, you just have to think a little bit and explore the wonderful backgrounds in the game and look for details you can use. In other words, it's even a joy to get stuck and come back later. You want to come back to the game.Nelly's charmingly British accent is also welcome in an over-exaggerated market of mostly American games. It also adds to the witty nature of the game.The only criticism I have is that the game is relatively short. I finished it in a total of seven hours in my first run. It would also be nice to have a higher difficulty setting to choose, so you could come back later and explore even more things. There are also some problems with the control, where you sometimes have to wait for Nelly walk to the next room once you've clicked, even if you click on something else before she gets there. But these complaints are very minor.Overall, I absolutely loved this game. It takes me back to a time (circa 1997) when point-and-click adventures were still around and flourishing. It's the best find I've done in quite a while and the perfect compliment for you if you're waiting the Monkey Island sequel that never arrives."
