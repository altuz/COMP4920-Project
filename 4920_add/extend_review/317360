This game is loaded with so much fast paced action it's so much fun to play and even if you suck, you still feel like a badass.Double Action: boogaloo is like a 90's action movie multiplayer game. It runs on the source engine so it looks and plays great!PROS:- Good graphics and effects- Good sound FX- Runs good- Fun gameplay- You can play it casual or get really in depth and learn all the tricks- Cool weapon/character selections and custom loadouts- Great map design- destructable items in map, like walls, glass, ect...- parkour elements- slow mo mode- First and third person mode- And much moreAs a free to play game I can't think of one con at all. Double action is very similar to the specialists if you like that you will like this.10/10"

It not only has fun competative gameplay, it has good action. Hence the name ""Double Action"".If you want to feel as though you were in an action movie, then this game is for you. I had alot of fun with this, and will contiue to in the future.Pros:- Good Multiplayer- Quick and easy to learn- Great weapons, classes and humorous ""cliched"" skinsCons:- Cursing Children (Can any multiplayer game these days not have cursing children?!?!?)- Lack of Regular Addons/Updates- Connection can get lag at times (The smaller the server the better)9/10 ""One of best free multiplayer games on steam, it's fun, edgy, and gives you ACTION""P.S  ""If you are a fan of the following- Chuck Norris- Bruce Lee- Clint Eastwood- Keanu Reeves- Bruce Willis-Sylvester Stallone- Jackie Chan- Jet Li- Steven Seagal- Liam Neeson- Mel Gibson- Nicolas Cage- Dolph Lundgren- Donnie Yen-Jason Statham- Jean-Claude Van Damme- Chow Yun-fat- Michael Jai White- Charles Bronson- Arnold Schwarzenegger- Samuel L.

76561198132578610,Recommended,317360,30043910,Posted: 19 February,all,Ken-Douken trade.tf me daddy!,"So, what can I say about Double Action:Boogaloo? A lot, that's what! This exciting, over-the-top Action-movie styled shooter is something of a unique design. It was derived off the mod for Half Life, The Specialists. While Double Action is made on the Source engine, rather than the old Goldsource engine, the game lacks the graphical touch that a lot of modern Source engine games get. However, if there has ever been a game that shows that a game doesn't have to have realistic graphics to be enjoyable, let it be this one. Double Action carries many unique traits that I have not yet seen in any other shooter. The feature that sets it apart from most shooters is the brilliantly fun Stunt system. This allows you to press right mouse (by default) to leap through the air, and even slide for several metres across the ground! Or you can use this to unrealistically and rather painfully slide up stairs, whatever you prefer. Not only this, but it has many other uses. You can use it to leap off walls, or effectively double-jump, the world is your oyster! The Stunt system isn't the only part of this shooter that makes it truly unique. While playing this game, you will find the game repeatedly slows down. This is for dramatic duels between players, and it allows you to make your moments of glory last that second longer. This leads to epic James Bond  (sorry I couldn't be more imaginitive!) movie-esque duels between players that never get dull. I could ramble on a bit longer, but for a man with only 3 hours into this game (at the time of writing this review, I plan to play many more!), I've bored you quite a bit. Here's a list of pros and cons of the game from my experience:Pros:+ It's free!+ The Stunt and slow-motion systems are unique to this game, and really add to the exiting atmosphere you're in when you play the game.+ Weapons are *fairly* balanced, none in particular stand out as 'overpowered' to me.+ Maps are strategically-well-designed.+ Bots seem to be fairly sensibly coded AI-wise.+ There are no in-game purchases.Cons:- There aren't many maps (albeit, as said above, they are well-designed).- The player base is fairly small, but I've never failed to find a server with a decent amount of people on it (I'd say 10 people is the minimum for a fun game, a lot less than the likes of Team Fortress 2).- Graphics could do with touching up a bit.- Updates from the developers are sparse, and there appears to be little communication between the developers and players as of late (the last update was in October of 2016)."

,Not Recommended,317360,29856251,Posted: 11 February,all,t0rlan,"Double Action: Boogaloo, while fun and based on some interesting core ideas, falls short of hitting the mark (no pun intended). The mechanics feel clunky and never quite do what you think they're going to do (think trying to dive through a window fluidly and instead boucing off the side of a building). Once you get used to its gameplay shortcomings though, you could see how this multiplayer game could shine given a thorough polish.My biggest problem? Every time I tried to quit the game it caused my computer to freeze with a black screen. For that reason alone I can't personally recommend it. If you're straped for cash and looking for a 'different' type of shooter this indie game might be for you, but beware the possibility of having to restart your computer every time you want to quit out."

,Not Recommended,317360,29561416,Posted: 29 January,all,★Jack♥,"Though this game has many upsides and can be very enjoyable, this review is about the downsides and what can be done to improve the game.One character in this game is literally Nick from Left 4 Dead 2 (Let it be known that the developer has stated on the forums that he has never played Left 4 Dead 2 and potentionally does not own Left 4 Dead 2.) The developer has also stated that he did not see a problem with Nick in the game because he has not played left 4 dead.The developer complains that development is difficult because the limits imposed by the source engine; however, the quality of this game does not live up to any of the other source mods.They did the typical bad game dev practice of needing the community to finish their game, however the game is in a playable state, but features that are added to the game are expected to be created by the community.Overall I rate this game a 4 out of 10, some of these development practices are unacceptable."

Gameplay - fun, full of action, but spawnkills are ridiculous and weapon choice is just... Uhm...

I know this is a mod and models are limited but that didn't stop Cry of Fear or Afraid of Monsters from trying there best.Finally, throughout all the previous cons this one sticks out the most: No instentive to keep playing. No rewards, no level ups, no crates. There is nothing to keep you playng as a reward.Now even throughout this onslaught of♥♥♥♥♥♥I did manage to find a few Pros to this game:Pros:Unique Gamplay Mechanics (In theory the idea of slowing down time and diving into a kill all wanted style is badass and a welcome new additon to the other cookie cutter MMOs)It's clear SOME effort was put into the game (Not Much Though)Free to Play.In conclusion; Despite this games unique gameplay and sense of freedom it still falls victim to the cons mking this game unplayable and rage inducing. It hurts to give this game a negative review cause there was SO MUCH potential in the creation but the creator or creators just didn't apply themselves enugh (or fell victim to time or budget constraints.All in all in an industry where most AAA shooters and Multiplyer Games copying the same formula time after time, unique games like this are a welcome respite. However, this game just couldn't hold up and instead fell victim to it's cons but i also think this game is a window into what time, money, passion, and a dedicated team"

,Recommended,317360,30223033,Posted: 27 February,all,DarkSamus9000,"Double Action: Boogaloo isn't for people with low-end computers. It doesn't look graphically demanding, but I tell you it is. I played with 10-20 FPS most of the time on my old 2013 laptop with an AMD APU.That aside, even with the framerate this game was loads of fun! There's something so goofy about seeing these men in suits with submachine guns running around, sliding down the floor, and jumping off walls. The gameplay is wild, immersive, and fun. If you're looking for a 3rd person shooter with a twist, this is your game!(Note: The game lets you switch from 3rd to 1st person so you can use which you prefer)"
