,Recommended,317470,29473802,Posted: 24 January,all,*MechanicOwl* (Snowy),"I've been playing CubicCastles for over 2 years now. It has been my main game for a long time. It has so much to do, building, mining, exploring, chatting with friends, quests, and shopping and there's so much more! I find the game great for finding friends to play with and build with. There are a few bugs here and there but the admins seem to get rid of those pretty quickly. All of the moderators are really nice and helpful and there are plenty of adults playing the game, not just kids. There are pretty frequent updates with new exciting clothes, blocks, and features. I think this game is great for everyone."

Our son wasted away nearly £100 over a 12 month period. This game actively encourges players to steal from each other. Our son had over 100000 coins stolen from him at various times whilst playing it. We eventually had to intervene and ban nedhim from playing it .Stay away, you have been warned!"

,Recommended,317470,30220644,Posted: 27 February,all,TheOnlyFeather,"Please take time to read this review.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~CUBIC CASTLES: A great game once you have played it for a while. Starting hours can be a bit rough and it can be hard to make some friends but, do not get discouraged! You can CUBITS, this is where the little kids were saying ""PAY TO WIN!!!!""Let me inform you though, thata buying these CUBITS are optional. You can get them without paying. (One of the ways would be mining in the mine, time consuming, but just get some music and have fun :3)Plus, you cant win in this game. So there is no ""Pay to win"" within cubic castles. IF YOUR WORRIED ABOUT LAG: You shouldnt be. This game can run on the crappiest of computers, with graphics down of course.I say, give this game time. Make some friends, meet new people, meet nice people (some people will even donate, just dont beg) and build your realm! DONT LISTEN TO THESE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. ITS MAINLY PEOPLE WHO GOT BORED AND NOOBS SAYING ITS PAY TO WIN."

,Recommended,317470,29401841,Posted: 21 January,all,BruhMcBruhsky,"Its a neat little game, all i ask of it is a recitpe book and more flexible point of veiw, like a zoom fearure. And with the recitpe book, maybe once you crsaft something, the recitpe gets recorded. And cubits are quite hard to get other than shops, but you cant even get a sucessful shop without at least 10k cubits. Jusgt make cubits drop more commonly, and maybe drop from cradfting and other things...Other than that, the graphics are good, the contross are good, and the overall vibe is good =D"
