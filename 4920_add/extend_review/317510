,Not Recommended,317510,15237365,"Posted: 6 April, 2015",all,Protoss,"What is ""Beyond Gravity""?Beyond Gravity is a very simple game set supposedly in space but with gravity none like it would be found in space. You take the role of an astronaut who crashes against a planet and has to jump from planet to planet, avoiding fireballs and collecting screws and cogs for no reason other than to buy upgrades for himself in his spaceship.If you lay all the horrifying failures in the story aside, however, you are treated with a simlistic yet for a while fun game that tests mostly your hand-eye coordination. Unfortunately you will notice that the game is as simple as a Flash game - which is not fair maybe to Flash games since there are some quite complex ones - or a mobile game - ditto - where you just tap to jump. That is all there is essentially.The game is fun for a while, and the rewards and achievements surely add to this, but it lacks content. There only is the probably endless mode. As it is, it is a game to get a fast and easy 100 percent achievements, but it is not a game I would recommend paying a lot for. I had maybe one to two hours of fun with it, and another hour of just playing it for the final few achievements.The graphics are simple but fitting, the sound also is neither good nor bad. The controls are very simple - mouse only and there you need only the left mouse button. You need to move the mouse only for menus.Recommended:If you like a no-brainer game or want easy and fast 100% achievements. The felt worth for this is at maxmimum around 1.50 USD.I would say, if you have it you can try it, but if you don't have it there is no real reason to buy it. So neutral again, with a negative tendency however. Although I don't want to condemn it - there surely is a populace that enjoys such games -, it is nothing I can wholeheartedly recommend either. I apologize here to the developer, if he reads this, and want to encourage him to add a few more game modes, like maybe a challenge mode or so, to add some more value."

You have to slide the menus as you would slide them on your phone (there's no arrows, no scrolling bars, nothing).The graphics are really basic, theres only 1 soundtrack in-game and it's not that good. It took me 2 hours 20 minutes to finish the game 100% so the $2 USD price is quite accurate for the amount of content.The game was fun for the first 30 minutes, then it became way to grindy and repetitive. I was feeling really bored on the last Goal because it takes so long to complete. There's only 1 variety of enemies (fireballs), the planets either go slow or fast and the planets either orbit left or right. It's really missing variety for a pc game.Personally, I dislike this game, it is ok for a short occasional play session, but that's about it."

Incredibly simplified game mechanics, cartoony graphics and Subway Surfer-esque challenge system as an incentive to continue playing.The ProsPrice- Even if the game is not so content rich, the low price might even justify the purchase. Often seen on 50% off, the trading cards are also pricy, so even if you regret purchasing this, the damage will be minimal.Achievements- I must admit the main reason I got this game was that it was cheap and with easy to obtain achievements. I like getting games I can 100% without spending a lot of hours. This being said, the title will get you 40 achievements in about 4 hours (that's how long it took me)The ConsGrinding- The game's objective is so basic and the upgrades require a lot of screws (aka ""coins"") that you will find yourself just grinding over and over again, aimlessly. I did not find the game nor challenging, nor fun. The only thing that kept me going were the challenges, which bring up the next point.Repetitive Challenges- As I've said, the gameplay is so minimal that the 40 challenges to beat (also the 40 achievements) are pretty much... the same. Many of them are just a reiteration of the last, but with a bigger number. Also, ""Jumping"" and ""Landing on Planets"" or ""Play x games"" and ""Die x times"" are the same thing. Doing 300, 500 respectively 1000 such actions is boring to say the least. Not to mention the boring ""Double jump once"" or ""Unlock these"".ConclusionDo I liked the game? No. Would I reccomend it to someone? Again no. Or at least not for PC, mabye it's a good time killer for mobile, but when you're at your PC with so many games to choose from, I cannot see a reason this should be on the list. There simply isn't enough content to justify it.If you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work,consider joining my groupandfollow my curatorpage!

The description of the game mentions it is ""procedurally generated"", I guess that is what they meant.As you progress through the game, the ""planets"" get smaller, they rotate faster and the distance between them increases. To deal with the growing difficulty, you can spend the picked up items to buy some upgrades. Now you can do multiple jumps in the air (space?), jump faster, pick up items at a greater distance, but nothing that changes the fundamental mechanics of the game. Additionally, the price for the upgrades is quite high, so you need to play again and again until you can afford to buy some upgrades, resulting in a gameplay that feels repetitive really quick (read: grindfest).Again, what isBeyond Gravity?Long story short: it is a simple flash game.The kind of game you can play on the web. I have no idea what the first flash games were, but they have been around for 15 years, easily. The more sophisticated ones, at least.So, the thing is, there are dozens of flash games out there that are better thanBeyond Gravity. And they are free.On the plus side,Beyond Gravityhas nice animations, and the visual style is pretty cute. And it has one distinct advantage over flash games on the web: achievements.My rating:For the genre (flash games):58 / 100For the grand scheme of gaming things:5 / 100My library categories:Flash, Trash"
,Not Recommended,317510,16251853,"Posted: 7 June, 2015",all,rocketsurgeon,"The description and videos make this game seem like much more than it is, which is a very simplistic mobile game. Your only interaction with the game is totapclick when you want your spaceman to jump. That's all.This works out nicely for a game played on a mobile while waiting for a bus or something, but ends up leaving something to be desired when you're sat down in front of your PC with the intention of playing games.Furthermore, this leaves very few directions for the game to go when ramping up the difficulty - something a PC player sitting down to play is very soon going to notice, as they blaze through levels, whereas the mobile gamer is not only going to need to travel many times before this happens, but since there's usually some time between bus rides, the resulting repetetivity will not be noticed as readily."
,Not Recommended,317510,14283675,"Posted: 1 February, 2015",all,LC-DDM,"Beyond Gravity is yet another mobile device game ported to the PC, where the simplicity of it all is quite straightforward. The story, or semblance of it, is that you're an astronaut sleeping while cruising through space on a ship when it's attacked by asteroids, making it crash onto a planet. From there onwards, your main goal is to get as much screws as you can as you jump from planet to planet using the Space-Bar or Left Mouse Button. During your travels you'll come up with challenges - some easy, some hard - that once completed, net you more screws. that can be used to upgrade your astronaut with all sorts of help, from a magnet for greater pickup distance, to a triple jump. Each challenge getting completed also nets you the corresponding achievement. This all reminds me of a Miniclip game called ""Rocket Man"" where you jumped from cloud to cloud, although all you have to do is take care of jumping rather than aim any angles - the planet's rotation does the angling for you. The music isn't much, just some looping drivel that isn't intrusive, but you -will- experience cutoff once it loops.Overall a stomachable game, but one you'll easily forget once you're done with all the challenges and getting all the upgrades. Recommended you get it with a 50% coupon to avoid any feelings of ripoff.2/5 - Graphics2/5 - Sound3/5 - Gameplay2/5 - Boring!"
,Recommended,317510,12223865,"Posted: 24 September, 2014",all,peremptor,This is a simple but enjoyable platformer whose primary gameplay mechanic is that you have to time your jump between rotating planets so you get all the screws in between. As you get more consecutive screws your multiplier increases and so does your scoring.That's basically the gist of it but its fun while you try to get all the achievements and 100% the game so well recommended to those that like that. Once you do that you'll probably never come back to it but that's alright.Fairly priced for what it is.
,Not Recommended,317510,12308179,"Posted: 30 September, 2014",all,baja gaijin,"Beyond Gravity's store page does not LIE, per se, but it makes some real stretching-the-truth claims. Calling this a ""one button procedurally generated platformer"" is sort of stretching a few of those: when you boot it for the first time, it will become clear you're playing a touchscreen mobile title thrown onto Steam haphazardly*, and the entire purpose of the game is ""collect space debris to upgrade yourself with powerups"", as you leap between constantly-revolving planets, trying to dodge obstacles and leap at just the right time to continue your chain of screw-grabbing without breaking the combo (so you get more parts per cog).The problem is, claiming this ""doesn't get repetitive"" is a lie. It's just ""click, click, wait, click, click in midair because you have a double jump and need to adjust course, wait, click, wait, wait, click, click..."" ad nauseum. As well, you're going to be playing A LOT of abortive runs to get the first powerup. I did about 8 rounds and was only at ~3500 of the minimum-10k currency you need for your first powerup. They get more expensive. If you want something to just zone out with and relax here and there, that's great, this is a great game at the price. I was hoping for something a little more challenging, not just a time-killer.* I don't care if a game comes from mobile, but I do care when you do it so, so poorly. Menus have no scrollbar and barely respond to a scrollwheel. You're going to be dragging the menu if you want to do anything, always a fun time when you use a mouse."

It is a one button game, as you would play it on your phone (tapping). It says in the ""About this game, features"" section that this game has this: ""Procedurally generated levels ensure non-repetitive and never ending fun."" Now, there isin't even levels, there is just one ""level"" you play on. I don't feel like the procedurally genereted part does ensure non-repetitive and never ending fun. The fun stops about 1-5 minutes after you've played it. The ""level"" is the same thing over and over and over again, just the 3 planets skins shifting in different speeds, rotationway (clockwise or anti-clockwise) and size. That is the only thing defferentiating.Now the music. There is only one soundtrack for this game, which I might add isin't very good, and yet loops again every so often. When the music stops and starts again they haven't done anything to make sure you don't notice the hole when it restarts.The artstyle are very basic, cartoony look.The pricing is reasonable for the amount of content you get, I picked it up for about 1 EUR (which is about 2 USD) and if you have a coupon it's no money at all.The features section also states that the game is running at 60 FPS, whilst I got some stutters sometimes, like quite bad, the FPS dropped down to 15-20 whilst jumping.The achievements stupidly made since you can only get 3 at a time, like a phone.Now, the end.

76561198004885007,Not Recommended,317510,12214777,"Posted: 23 September, 2014",all,AxemJinx,"I don't recommend this game for three reasons. One, not enough variety; two, the shop prices feel too high; three, there's little sense of risk.The gameplay involves jumping from planet to planet while collecting screws and dodging fireballs that travel up and down. That's a nice foundation, but it's all there is. If you can line yourself up and time your jumps properly, you can go on for dozens of minutes in a single run and not see anything new besides planets, screws, and the occasional group of fireballs. It would have been nice to see different types of obstacles, planets, or powerups, especially once you survive past the first few minutes.My first run lasted around twenty minutes, and I managed to collect around 10,000 screws. Not bad, right? Actually, that was barely enough to buy the cheapest item at the shop, and all it did was increase my jump speed slightly. Most items cost at least 40,000 screws, which equates to over an hour of playtime at my speed. When you consider how repetitive the gameplay can be, that feels way too long.There are optional challenges you can complete, but I've gone through around 50% of them, and so far the payouts don't seem to exceed 1,000 - 2,000 screws. Maybe the later ones are better, but some of them are rather tedious (play 30 games), and you can only pursue three at a time. Keep in mind that most of the shop items themselves- jump faster, attract screws from father away, increase your score multiplier- aren't anything exciting, in my opinion.You press the left mouse button to set your angle, then release to jump. You can cancel a jump by holding down the left mouse button long enough, so there's no sense of commitment when you pick an angle. As the speed of the planets and fireballs increases, you can repeatedly cancel angles that look bad without any apparent penalty (unless I'm missing something). It makes me wonder what will kill patient, precise players first: the fireballs, or boredom?Now, I bought this for $1, so you could argue I'm being awfully nitpicky at that price point, and I don't entirely disagree. Still, I think Beyond Gravity really lacks a sense of longevity. If more gameplay elements- planet types, obstacle types, powerups- were added, I'd consider changing my stance, but as of this writing I don't recommend it."

You crash landed your spaceship on a remote planet.  Now you must jump from planet to planet collecting screws.  Gravity is the only gameplay gimmick, though it doesn't play the role that it could if gameplay was expanded to offer different levels of gravity.  Instead you click when your character, on a rotating planet, is next to the next screw and they will jump directly onto the next planet.  Of course this gets slightly more difficult when the path of the screws is further away, but honestly, there is no difficulty level in this game, it is purely a casual click fest.  While the game doesn't offer much in a challenge, I still recommend it since it is well executed.  Just make sure you get it for the right price."

The object is to jump from one spinning planet to the next, while picking up as much junk as you can in between. You can spend your junk (screws and stuff) on upgrades to make the jumps a little easier and more effective at picking up more junk.The graphics are cute, the music is bubbly, and the gameplay is really excellent. You'll catch on right away but mastering the jump angles and timing between planets, which are different sizes and rotate at different speeds and often in different directions, is a bit trickier and what makes Beyond Gravity worth playing.Addictive and really fun.

We can jump backwards, but that doesn't matter, the streak is ended.Double-jump doesn't behave *at all* as one would expect: the second jump completely ignores the momentum of the preceeding jump, such that jumping backwards to catch a missed bolt *will* cause you to die the first time you do it, since you'd expect to keep going backwards on the 2nd jump.Treating the lack of a ""cancel jump"" input as a feature is disingenuous.

Unfortunately, Beyond Gravity was not that game.I guess I'll start with the good points. The art and sound assets are nice, and the port is competent, if bare-bones. The goals the game gives you are also a nice change of pace, giving you something to look forward to beyond just playing the game. The game is also extremely cheap, only a dollar on sale at the moment. Unfortunately, that's about all the nice things I can say about this game.The gameplay is fun at first, but then you quickly realize that not only is there very little variety, the upgrade curve is all wrong. You can keep going and going and going, but it really doesn't provide you any benefit unless you manage to perfectly hit each and every screw to get the multiplier going up. In fact, several of the goals incentivize you to simply jump into the void at the very start of the game over and over again simply to get the deaths required to unlock the next one. And if you want to build that multiplier up, you're probably going to need to pick up some upgrades, which are frankly hideously expensive at the start. It should be the other way around: give you cheaper upgrades at the beginning to give you a feeling of progress as you move through through the unlock system. Instead, you'll be grinding out screws over and over and over again before you even get one. In about two hours of play, I unlocked two things. It's almost like it was built to sell in-app purchases in a mobile game. There are no such purchases, either on Steam or in the mobile version, which makes it only more bizarre.Hard-to-acquire upgrades and little variety in gameplay make this hard to recommend. At a dollar I'd say you're right about getting your money's worth. The game has a fair amount of visual polish, but it's a shame there's not so much game behind it to encourage you to keep playing."

One, not enough variety; two, the shop prices feel too high; three, there's little sense of risk.The gameplay involves jumping from planet to planet while collecting screws and dodging fireballs that travel up and down. That's a nice foundation, but it's all there is. If you can line yourself up and time your jumps properly, you can go on for dozens of minutes in a single run and not see anything new besides planets, screws, and the occasional group of fireballs. It would have been nice to see different types of obstacles, planets, or powerups, especially once you survive past the first few minutes.My first run lasted around twenty minutes, and I managed to collect around 10,000 screws. Not bad, right? Actually, that was barely enough to buy the cheapest item at the shop, and all it did was increase my jump speed slightly. Many items cost at least 30,000 screws, which equates to at least an hour of playtime at my speed. When you consider how repetitive the gameplay can be, that feels way too long.There are optional challenges you can complete, but I've gone through around 25% of them, and so far the payouts don't seem to exceed 1,000 - 2,000 screws. Maybe the later ones are better, but some of them are rather tedious (play 30 games), and you can only pursue three at a time. Keep in mind that most of the shop items themselves- jump faster, attract screws from father away, increase your score multiplier- aren't anything exciting, in my opinion.You can cancel a jump by holding down the left mouse button long enough, so there's no sense of commitment when you pick an angle. As the speed of the planets and fireballs increases, you can repeatedly cancel angles that look bad without any apparent penalty (unless I'm missing something). It makes me wonder what will kill patient, precise players first: the fireballs, or boredom?Now, I bought this for $1, so you could argue I'm being awfully nitpicky at that price point, and I don't entirely disagree. Still, I think Beyond Gravity really lacks a sense of longevity. If more gameplay elements- planet types, obstacle types, powerups- were added, I'd consider changing my stance, but as of this writing I don't recommend it."

The controls are literally just one button; Either your space bar or left click, that is it. You use these simple controls to guide your crashed astronaut (Jeff) through a series of different planets, by literally planet hopping, trying to avoid the occasional fire balls hitting you in the face and squishing you and collecting screws to repair your spacecraft, (I'm assuming anyway).Among that, it offers some quaint little upgrades, visual ones included, stereotypical system for a ported pad game, but in all, it's an addicting little thing that is brilliant if you enjoy the 100% of achievements and such.The system of only being able to work on 3 achievements at a time was one I've not seen before but came to enjoy quite a bit as it didn't have you trying to do about 20 different ones at any given time, it also actually felt rewarding with having to collect them at the end of a round that you had just earnt certain ones within.The graphic style is another thing I have to give it credit for as it's one I'm particularly partial to personally. However..There is one background throughout the entirety of the game along with one soundtrack which is all nice and dandy for a short while, but you soon find yourself diving into the options to turn it off and play some music of your own just to numb out the sound from the game as it really does grate on your nerves after a while. Along those lines, it also doesn't offer much if any replay value once you've unlocked all the goals, aside from fully upgrading everything and occasionally opening it up to just play something fun that doesn't require much brain power at all. Other than that, it's fantastic and gives a good 4ish hours of play."
,Recommended,317510,17958231,"Posted: 9 September, 2015",all,JacquesLeSauve,"Poor Jeff. All he wanted to do was go out for a spot of space dogging, drop off at the space pub on his way home, have a few space pints, then go home and ignore his space wife before calling it a night. But he's only gone and fallen asleep at the wheel like a stupid c*nt and crashed into an asteroid, completely destroying his space car and writing off his no claims bonus in the process. What a stupid c*nt.Now you'll have to help him jump from rotating planetoid to planetoid, timing the jumps carefully so he can collect screws and cogs littered between them in convenient arcs whilst making sure he doesn't fly off into the vast void of space or hit any hazards along the way. Do this for as far as you can, collecting as many pieces as you can, use these pieces to upgrade your look or abilities, then go back to the start and do it all over again. It's essentially an endless jumper. But not the kind you wear, coz that'd just be mad, you crazy b*stard.It's literally one-button gameplay as you hit the space bar (waheeey!) to jump, or hold it down to ready your next perilous leap. You can also double jump and later upgrade to a triple jump, but that's pretty much the only nuance to this game that's all about timing and little else. It has a pretty nice, if uncomplicated, look about it, and the audio is perfectly adequate without ever being spectacular. Which basically sums up this whole game.With only one mode and relatively little replay value beyond high scores or easy (if not mildly time-consuming) achievements, this won't hold your attention for any great length of time, which is reflected in the price. But I still thoroughly enjoyed that short time with this since it served as a nice break of mindless fun between greater, more demanding games, coz sometimes it's nice to just do a few space jumps for a while without having to worry about anything else. Though I do worry about what his space wife will say once she learns what Jeff's done to their no claims bonus. Oh, poor Jeff. What a stupid c*nt."

The point of the game is to jump from planet to planet, collecting as many screws as you can. There are 40 goals/ achievements, all of which can be obtained fairly reasonably.PROS+ The game is fun and has a good balance between being simple and challenging.+ The game is inexpensive.+ It is really easy to get 100% of the achievements in a short amount of time.CONS- The game is short. I got everything in just over three hours, you could do it in less.- Limited replayablity. Once you've gotten all the tasks/ achievements, there's not a ton of incentive to play more. There are skins and additional skills, but you can do everything without them, leaving little incentive to push to collect them.- Some of the tasks are more of a grind than anything else. They don't involve any skill per se, just jumping or dying over and over until you hit the number.All in all, I would most certainly recommend the game.

The game is simple for almost anybody to play like many iphone games of this type. The main idea of the game is to jump from planet to planet and so forth to collect as many bolts and nuts as humanly as possible (These can be later spent in the shop). Mainly pros come along with this game but also the cons. The graphics on this game is nice and crisp in my opinion, and the style of art in the game i really like. The replayability of the game is also very well, as after you complete all the achievements you can do them all over once more. In addition; gaining 100% completion in this game is also very easy, to get this you will only need to do the achievments given to you IN-GAME! If you complete one that you have not been given in the game yet you will have to do them again. One con that annoyed me was trying to navigate in the store, sometimes when i try to scroll it does not work very well. So on, another con happens to be the price of some upgrades in the store the lowest priced upgrade is 10,000 BOLTS! In conclusion: this is a very fun and time wasting game that can get almost anybody addicted. and for $1.99 the game is worth buying in my opinion, or maybe pick it up on sale, as it is currently now for $0.99, or possibily buy it with an ingame coupon like i did myself.97/100 bananas"

I say activity because I can't really call it a game. There is no ""win"" condition, you can just keep on going until you miss. There are, however, a good number of goals, earned by completing randomly assigned tasks. You can only work on three at a time, but completing each gives you an in-game bonus and a Steam achievement.Each round, you begin with the character's spaceship crash-landing and him ejecting to the next closest planet. Each planet spins and you click your mouse to pause its rotation. When you release the mouse, the character jumps off, hopefully aligned in a trajectory which will end with him on the next planet in line. As you go, you can collect nuts and bolts, which act as currency for the game’s shop which is stocked with a number of upgrades and customization items.

The gameplay consists of pushing the mouse button at the right moment. That's it.So, why a thumbs up? Well, I really wanted to be annoyed with the game when I first started off. But I just can't. It is the gaming equivalent of squeezing a stress ball.You just do this one thing again and again.It is not what you have learned to expect from balls / PC games.Still, sometimes, it feels just right.Losing is absolutely painless. There is no progression in a game round, you just go on jumping off randomly generated planets until you miss a jump or get struck by a fireball. There is no difficulty and/or reward scaling to lose when you just start over. You don't lose anything - it might as well be a pause in the game where you have to press ""retry"" to unpause and keep on. I also love games with high stakes where you pay for every mistake, but sometimes I just want to relax.Don't buy this game expecting the wow factor of an awesome transforming robot or the refined tactics of a chessboard. Buy it for what it is: An unashamedly cheap, simple foam ball that makes you happy when you squeeze it absentmindedly for a while after a stressful day."

It's not a BAD game for what it is; it's just that it's completely mindless.  Which I'm totally okay with when it's 11PM and I'm just waiting for my laundry to finish and I'm too tired to do anything else, and oh look, trading cards!  XD  The thing is, the achievements in this game are either gimme or grindy with very little middle ground, and the point at which I abandon a totally mindless game is the point at which the grind outweighs whatever small humor factor the game might have without a plot to keep my interest.  Unfortunately, this occurs at the 1 hour mark.  :\Now, I'm not the type to ask for a refund because of this; I'm the type that's going to wait for the trading cards to finish dropping before uninstalling.  But I can totally see how the new refund policy would be this game's kryptonite, or so I've been reading.Bottom line:  do you enjoy colorful time-wasters that require a minimum of thought and a token amount of skill (and, to the game's credit, I never felt my losses were cheap roadblocks written into the game; it was actually far more forgiving than I expected it to be)?  Then you'll like this game.  Are you the type who gets bored of beeps and bloops and flashing lights in about an hour/when the insomnia wears off?

This is a given with most mobile ports anyway so whatever.The way Achievements work is also brought over from mobile:Upon completing a Challenge that the game sets for you, you get another to do. You have three active challenges at a time.Whether you'd made some progress towards that new challenge doesn't matter- you can't start the game and immediately die three times to get that Achievement, you have to wait unti the game makes that Achievement one of your active challenges.Very interesting; this adds further to grinding, but if you just concentrate specifically on those challenges when they're given you, you can get some grindy ones and work towards those Achievements, so as to lessen the amount of tedium.The other issue (which, again, is carried over from mobile) is that the menu doesn't respond well to a scrolling mouse-wheel so you have to drag.This is (probably) the mobile port that feels most like a mobile port while on PC without that necessarily being a bad thing.The game is mindnumbing and I suck at it.

In the beginning though, I get maybe 800 screws a game on average, and the first item is 10,000 screws. I thought it was really expensive for the first item, but I enjoy the challenge of ""planet hopping"" enough to keep playing to buy that item.However, after an hour or so, the game becomes INCREDIBLY grind-y where the missions can be like ""Land on 500 planets"" along with ""Have a near miss with 15 fireballs (which is not easy)"" and even just getting gears takes a while, maybe if the devs would tone down the prices, then this would be a better experience."

Completing challenges will unlock achievement progress and give the player some goal in a carefree game about nothing. For a completionist this is a must have."

There is one function: click(or space, depending on your playstyle) to jump in between planets. You jump in the direction of your head. That direction changes because the planets spin, like in real life, except not really. Also you can hold space to stop the planets rotation and get time to hink if you really want to jump there. If you don't want to, just wait a while and you dont have to jump after all. Repeat until victory or death.Also, upgrades.Play this game, but get it on your phone rather than on steam because it's cheaper but provides the same experience, and then your friends can't see how much of your life you've wasted.10/10"

Well, the basic action never changes.  It is timing a jump off a rotating planet.  After a few hours and completing enough goals to improve your ""ship"" to where it shows just where you should jump, it becomes easier, not more fun.  You can hold your jump so as to not hit the fireball, but if you start your jump wrong you have to wait for it to wear off and spin around again, which is annoying.  There is no real skill involved, no progression, and the goals which just give you bonus screws, eventually just repeat and are only good for cosmetic changes to the ship.  I got bored before getting  that far.  So I guess it's worth half a buck or whatever, but just barely."

Achievements are very easy to reach but you don't feel under pressure to reach them. Most of them naturally occur during your run/s.There's gameplay and costume upgrades that you can buy with the screws you've collected as well.I can't tell what's more relaxing when I play this game, the music, the rotating planets or the sounds that my little astronaut guy is making?Anyway, super recommended for casual players and/or achievement hunters!"

I would have preferred to have the entire forty available. The limiting of goal availability is a bit painful.For example: It is annoying when you have just made a good journey of over 1000m without dying, and then you get the next goal, which is to travel 1000m.But that's the only complaint I have about this game.This could be a good game for teaching kids about trajectory.Either way, I'm pretty sure that kids would enjoy this.Buy this game on the basis that it is a simple cartoon game.It's good for a bit of light entertainment."
