,Recommended,317710,12040352,"Posted: 9 September, 2014",all,internisus,"Whenever a highly challenging arcade game with quick runs based upon dodging obstacles comes along, every journalist and pundit in the industry declares it a new incarnation of Super Hexagon—though sadly not, as far as I have seen, accompanied by the gruesome headline that we masochists so richly deserve: ""Super Hexagain.""The reason why so many leap to this comparison is obvious: Terry Cavanagh's game represents the pinnacle of the genre.  But while I enjoy seeing that fact so widely recognized, it's also led to a string of frustrating disappointments because few who remember it seem to actually understand why it is so good.  I've put more than 150 hours into Super Hexagon and at one point was the 27th best player in the world.  I consider it a perfect work of game design, and every time its name is invoked for the purpose of describing some newly announced this or that I can see within moments that the supposed successor is a mere pretender.Velocibox fares far better than most.  Like Super Hexagon, it is an addictive game of fast, involuntary pace and geometry avoidance with short runs and instantaneous retries.  It is even thematically similar, concerning itself with cubes much like Super Hexagon celebrates its flatter six-sided shape.  Is Velocibox as good as Super Hexagon?  Well, no, it's not.  Its design is a bit more convoluted due to the scoring system and, more importantly, the ramifications of its third dimension.Firstly, instead of merely avoiding patterned sets of obstacles, the player must also guide the avatar to run across cube pickups both as a means to progress to the next level (which pops in after every six pickups) and in order to increase the score and its multiplier.  Taking too long between cubes causes the score multiplier to be lost, and so it is vital when attacking the leaderboard to aggressively pursue them.  Your interest is thus divided between maneuvering to survive and taking risks in order to pick up cubes more frequently for a better score, whereas in Super Hexagon survival time simplyisthe score.  Objectively, the design is less pure; however, some players may prefer Velocibox's approach for generating tension and fostering a more active form of competitive play.The more essential difference is that, because the three-dimensional field extends forward into the distance, the hazards are not uniformly visible like those of Super Hexagon.  By itself, this is not necessarily a bad thing; the nature of the challenge is simply different.  However, it is important to consider that perhaps the most clever thing about Super Hexagon is the fixed relationship between the disorienting field rotation, the player's rate of movement, and the visibility of forthcoming labyrinth at the edges of the screen.  Brilliantly, each stage throughout the game ramps up these intertwined factors until the field rotation abruptly stops in the post-game stage, limiting visibility unevenly and suddenly making aspect ratio a key factor for gameplay.  In that transformative moment, Super Hexagon reveals itself to be an entirely different game than previously assumed and requires a new layer of awareness and decision making from the player.  In contrast, Velocibox offers a free range of evasive movement that is disconnected from the rate of forward motion and maze discovery, and both remain static from one level to the next.  It makes no attempt to explore changes to field visibility—indeed, it probablycannotbecause it does not share the abstraction of Super Hexagon's 2D plane.  It is, ironically, limited in scope by the lack of restrictions posed by its 3D environment.Ultimately, though, despite not being as interesting or as beautiful a work of game design as Super Hexagon, what Velociboxdoesaccomplish is to be quite a good game, and that is certainly enough.  Not everything has to be a work of absolute genius, and it may well be impossible for anything to truly match Super Hexagon because it is so thorough in exploring the possibilities of the carefully limited space that it defines for itself.  Despite the clear parallels between the two, Velocibox occupies a different space, and it is to our benefit that they can coexist."

,Recommended,317710,12068710,"Posted: 11 September, 2014",all,More_Badass,"When you break down twitch games to their base elements, they tend to revolve around the same basic concepts: fast gameplay, and dodging things at high speeds. Some excel in their simplicity, like the classic flash game Vector Runner or the more recent Super Hexagon, while others add more complexity, such as Pivvot, Wave Wave, and Duet. Point is, that since the core elements are generally similar, it takes something more, something exceptional for games in the genre to stand out. Velocibox is one of those games, and it's perhaps the most addictive twitch game I've played since Super Hexagon.Expanded and improved from an entry for the current ""Connected Worlds"" Ludum Dare, Velocibox is unforgiving. In fact there aren't any checkpoints, when you fail (and you will), you start over from the first stage. Initially, I disliked this lack of checkpoints, but once I played more, I came to appreciate how the game was set up. Success relies on practice, learning the quirks and obstacles of each stage and surmounting them. It's more than twitch reflex but also adaption and gradual improvement, not just ""one more go"" but ""I know these obstacles. I can do better"". It's incredibly satisfying to race through stages that had defeated you countless times before.But what makes Velocibox exceptional, because that's a pretty strong word? Well, it's more that all the game's aspects merge into a excellent whole rather than any individual element. It's the sense of speed, the feeling of racing forward at some extreme velocity, blasting off from stage one without a moment to catch your breath. It's the gravity-defying gameplay, as you flip between floor and ceiling and ride the walls. It's how the gravity flip mechanic opens the door for a wide variety of obstacles that wouldn't be possible in other twitch games, forcing you to deftly maneuver around and across all sides of these corridors. It's the vibrant visuals and effects, the great music, the no-frills presentation that lets you jump into the action in seconds.I've only reached stage four out of nine, and beating the initial nine stages unlocks an even more insane Super Velocibox mode, so there's a hefty amount of content here. Velocibox is an easy recommendation for fans of the genre."

,Recommended,317710,12105265,"Posted: 14 September, 2014",all,phox,"This game does a great job of making you want more of it. Not just in gameplay, but in score. As you play as a cube that avoids the plethora of obstacles that the different stages throw at you, you earn a score. You earn MORE score and progress through different levels as you pick up miniature cubes that float about the stage. The faster you pick up the cubes, the higher you score. See where this is going? As you constantly put yourself in danger for the sake of these cubes, you die. Repeatedly. Just when you think you're about to enter another stage, you die. This adds a very effective method of addiction. Just for that, this game has done its job well 10/10.But that's not all. The game also adds a couple rewarding steam achievements as you continue to progress through the levels, which is a nice touch. Most indie games like this don't have any achievements, so that aspect really adds to the game. On top of that, you get steam trading cards which add another awesome touch. You can collect them all and craft badges, or sell them at quite a high price ($0.40 a piece? 11/10 overachiever).The only downside is the controller support. The controller could have been configured better, such as moving slow which you push a tiny bit on the joystick, and fast when you jerk it. As of right now, it moves at a set speed no matter where the joystick is.Other than that, the game is great. Pick it up, and be one of the first to enjoy it. Just make sure to put it on super settings, because it ran the smoothest and had the best sensitivity, and have no homework to do, because once you're in the game, all you'll think is...VELOCIBOX"

The fast pace-quick reaction based 3d funtime special which is available almost any time one feels like spending a casual 10 minutes without thinking at all, just going with the flow and experiencing a sheer discharge of brain activity is so very appealing. He who searches for a game of such notion and capacity, buy this game at this instant. You have found your ultimate casual game. Also a side note; play it with a controller."

I havent played this game for long but this games difficulty is up there with games like the Impossible Game and Geometry Dash. To advance each level, you must collect small cubes as you are dodging obstacles in your path. I like the whole idea of being able to flip upside down to dodge things while also being able to use left and right, but flipping upside down completely throws me off and usually results in a death.A problem that i have with this game is that every runthrough feels the same. Level 1 always has the same obstacle patterns and the same collectiable placements and i could see this getting very boring after a while. Bare in mind this is one of those games where you will always start from the first level so people such as myself that are having a hard time may get bored seeing the same level layout over and over again.Overall i think its a good game to play if your looking for a challenge. The music is awesome and it could be fun for possibly a few hours. Recommend to anyone that is looking for a challenge, but for anyone else, its best to save your money.6/10"
,Recommended,317710,32405390,Posted: 14 June,all,SpiritFryer,"After finally getting all the achievements, I am ready to provide a mini review. I love challenging minimalistic games, and have enjoyed Velocibox very much. Be advised though that more than anything, the game requires a lot of patience and some memorization, as the only way (at least for me) to beat higher levels is to figure out a safe way to traverse the obstacles, and then learn to quickly recognize which obstacle is coming up next, so you would have time to recall the safe path and execute it, until you slowly but surely develop muscle memory for the obstacle, after which it becomes almost trivial. But other similar games such as Super Hexagon have this aspect to them as well. The only problem is that when you die, you will always have to restart from level 1. So figuring out safe paths on later levels will take a lot of deaths, patience, and more deaths. The journey of figuring out all the obstacles and developing muscle memory for traversing them has been very fulfilling for me though."
