Fun idea but there needs to be more to a game than ""make friends with all the villiagers..... do villagers tasks..... so now kill all the villagers off""."

Its different and very fun you are kel a skeleton and you can use mana to change form to human so you dont scare villagers ..you go on quests and collect things as you go . I dont want to take away from the humor by telling anything but i bought it twice in my opinion its well worth $3 .."

The game has allot of character, the dialogue is well thought out and funny. It also has a completely original storyline unlike anything I have ever seen in other games, the first thing I think of being Dungeon Keeper but obviously this is of a completely different genre. I say that because in this you play as the evil Skeleton named KEL who claims to represent all the enemy sprites in previous RPG games through the ages. World design is fantastic and you can tell that allot of imagination has gone into creating and realising not only the development of the town but also the easter eggs like the Skeletons banqueting round a table and the retired mage who claims to have 'lost allot of weight' (you will see why), but thats where the positives end.The gripes I have with this game are few but weigh heavily. The world is very small, one town, a wilderness, a number of easter eggs and the occassional lonesome hovel. This does make the game feeling lonely and enclosed in a small place, leaving you wanting a whole lot more. There is very little combat, you basically have to use your intellect as if the game was almost entirely a puzzle, althrough that might be a positive. The final problem I have is that you have an inventory of items that can be used but rarely anything equipable and there is no stats at all it would seem.To sum up, I really think the positives save this game. The atmosphere of the OST and design are more than satisfactory and the puzzles quickly become addictive once you start to solve the early ones. The negatives are always present but let's remember this is in early access and you certainly get your £2 worth. Final verdict: The game deserves the mixed review status it currently has.Here is my lets play of KEL Reaper of Entropy:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0VLAheJah4"

Couldn't get a ""Talk"" Option with any of the villagers, but  it seems to be a very basic quest-based game.You may want to give it a try when on Sale or in a bundle for 1-2 bucks. But don't expect a lot."

The gameplay is in 3rd person where theirs no morals like your playing as the caracter in the game.It was like a program that got halfway made and put together at the last minute.It has very poor realistic gameplay, like when you fight. or talk to someone. you'd be better off getting an old rpg style game thats of the value of the price its a waste of money.Kindda like its spam where they get you to buy it before you know its not a real game.Thers thousands of people that look at these games on steam so im sure that they are happy to take your money without making a real game. three dallors adds up with so many people.This is a review so you know what your paying for in my expierence. I bet steam had it voted on green light because of the peoples votes, but seeing the way the game comes together its not something youd want to pay for. Its like they couldnt find out how to make the story of the skeliten that you fight and make it into a game so they made it joke arround where you would think its fun to make you feel like you bought a game. but IT is poorly made and not good as a product worthy for syeam i feel. thanks steam for these cheap games you give us but this one was not fairly reviewed before adding it.Thanks to allThe story could progress into a good game before released its a great theme with allot of potential But has to have more work deffinaty has to have more work. ( ALL IN MY OPPINION)"

,Recommended,317950,11955253,"Posted: 2 September, 2014",all,OhioMan,"Decided to play this a little more offline and It seems like a game that really would be something that could use like a level editor with a workshop so people can add mods to this game, Like new villages for example or some more houses. I generally play more of the moddable games like for example Skyrim, There is so much you can do with it even after completing the game. I myself as being a 3D graphics designer/Modeler for a popular 3d/VR/chat environment called ActiveWorlds have also been working with skyrim mods off and on. I see so much potential that could be done with this game. this game may seem not much like one of my favorite games of all time which is Diablo 2. But however it has that slight Diabloish feel to it somewhat. Would I recommend this game, Sure would. Tho being on a fixed income I wait for games to go on sale. But if I had the money I would pay full price."

,Recommended,317950,12648731,"Posted: 26 October, 2014",all,Snotball,"First impressions are that I'm enjoying the heck out of this fun little adventure game. Its a great idea for a game and i hope that they take the concept futher in the future. Game was made with the Unreal engine which is always cool to see. The dev team was small, 2 people so dont expect an enormous game. I've heard its got about 2-3 hours of gameplay but so far (30 minutes in) I'm enjoying the back and forth banter between the main character and the other items/npc's that i've discovered. It's my kind of humor and the story feels well structured."
