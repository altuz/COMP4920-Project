Usually it's the other way around.That said, the game is definitely an early access game.  Content is limited.  But what there is, is good, and in my opinion it's worth investing in this game in the hope for more content.Graphics style is gritty cartoon and caricature.  Oversized heads, bulging muscles, punches to the face, etc.  There's a lot of humor in this game and pop culture references.It's basically a board game with cards.  You and an opponent take turns rolling dice and moving around a board.  When you land on a space there might be a neutral enemy you can either fight to get gold or hire them so that they will fight the opponent.  The battles are just one hit and then they are done, it does not continue until someone dies.  So basically you're trying to whittle down your opponents HP to zero over time.   Each game I've played has been fairly short, so it's not like a long drawn out campaign.You can use cards to lay down friendly minions, spells to harm enemies, movement spells to move you where you want to go, and other options.   But those cost action points to use and you only have so many action points per turn.There are different characters you can play and they each have their own special abilites and cards.  That makes for a nice variety in playstyle.tl;dr breakdown:Card game on a square board.

Right now it's early access, so the game is very incomplete, but something to put on your watch list to buy for sure when its ready to go!The game is a deck building game, but played on a board where you roll dice to move around, and deal with the challenges on each space through your characters abilities or cards you can play from your deck, all the while fighting the larger threat of the boss you must fight who is also traversing the board.  It has good strategy elements, fun graphics, and a touch of randomness that can make you cheer or cry out in agony when that one die roll does or doesn't go your way."

The content is pretty minimal, but I expected that from an early access game. The main issue is that the core gameplay is very similar to Culdcept, but it lacks the depth that made those games fun (cards and spaces don't have suits, the decks are much smaller, a card's attack is the same as it's defence, etc.). The only area where it matches Culdcept is in quality of the writing. Which is terrible.Overall, I'm kinda disappointed. If they add a TON of content it might have some charm, but the gaps in the core game design are almost too big to fill with fluff. I don't hate it, but it left me even more bummed out that no one has made a decent Culdcept port/copy.Suggestions for the dev team:-Add multiplayer support-Add a card trading mechanic (I feel like I shouldn't have to say this)-Get a native English speaker to do the writing for you-Go replay Culdcept and copy it better"

While playing the game there were a few things that rubbed me the wrong way:-I do enjoy some funny Memes but the Story Mode sometimes trys waaaaay to hard to fit in some stupid references that aren't funny-Balancing is an issue cause some of the Cards seem vastly OP while others seem straight up useless-The game doesn't really have any replayability because starting with a different class for your main-character doesn't add anything to the experience since you can just switch to one of the side-character and you'll pretty much know what the other classes offer.-There are no unlocks for beating the game other than some achievments-For a cardgame of this day and age to have no multiplayer is kind of wierd especially when everything in the game screams loudly ""WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO EXPERIENCE SOME OF THIS WITH FRIENDS?!""-Some of the missions aren't explained all that well ,for example when it says ""You win the game when your enemy has no Gold"" you can just straight up kill them and win that way and in some missions It's even the way better option to do so.-Lastly at the date of this Review there is a Glitch in this game that makes the information of a field show up and not dissapear you can't get rid of it for the rest of the match so you'll have to restart the whole mission to make it go away.All in all eventhough the game has a lot of wasted potential, it's still fun for a quick singleplayer playthrough, definetly worth picking up should it be on Sale."

As you run around the board, you encounter neutral and hostile monsters.

This game borrows from many other games and sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesnt. The thing I like the least is the obvious hearthstone copying of the deeck builder as well as the card backs.

Im talking no-hope lose from round 3 destroyed gainst the wolf. At the moment it is hard to tell if it is something I am doing wrong, or whether my class just cant beat the character.

I remember stumbling upon a trailer for this game on YouTube and being heavily intrigued by the art style and the game mechanics displayed and as I ventured futher into the video I felt a slight inspiration from Hearthstone and 100% Orange Juice; which caused me to become more interested. With more and more research of the game I slowly started to notice that this game fused the best of trading card games and table top games into one.With that being said, you can not go wrong with spending five dollars on a game with such a high level of game play, strategy, humor, and replay value.

The game lags consistantly and that's the best that it runs. I'm playing on a fairly new Macbook so it's not hardware and I haven't ruled out formatting issues.As far as actual gameplay goes Dicetiny unapologetically rips from Hearthstone, even down to their card designs and abilities. Though I am looking foreward to a collectable card game that is not pay-to-win. I already play Mtg and I don't need to spend the rest of my income on virtual cards...The other major source of insperation for gameplay is Monopoly, thats where the board game part of the formula comes in. If you've ever played monopoly just imagine Dicetiny as a hybrid of that and Hearthstone and thats all thats about all thats going on here aside from the... ""humor"", but I'll get back to that. Calling those two games ""influences"" is like saying CoD:MW really only laid the ground work for the innovations CoD:MW2,3,6,&11 brought to the table. I feel like theres so much room to do intresting things with this format. Maybe take a few more liberties with card design, or if the creators are only intrested in mashing up existing ip's why not try Mario Party? A board with multiple routes would offer tons of gamplay variation. Or perhaps multiplayer?And then theres the humor... This game had me really excited to see the writing. I thought the tag lines about ""popculture"" couldn't be sincere and that Dicetiny was mascerading as a shallow experence, but would develop into some kind of subversion of tropes and expectations, and perhaps commenting on the very nature of ""pop culture"" itself. Damn was I wrong. Watch the trailers and you get a pretty good idea of what your in for. Without spoiling anything(at this point there really isnt much to spoil) the opening starts with a long crawl of text(yes like star wars) that has a lot of words which provided a sentence's worth of story and an obscene amount of jokes/refrences that fell flat at their best, and were irritating at their worst. Dictiny's sense of humor does not go beyond ""HEY!!!! Remeber THIS thing??? LOL. OMG SO RANDOM, am I rite???XD"". I'm talking Schwarzenegger and LotR. The skimming the surface level of muck from over exposed culture.So as it stands with it's current proformance issues, simplistic hybrid gameplay, and obnoxious writing, I'd actually recomend it at its current early access price of 75% off. Who knows, the gameplay may evolve to such a fantastic level that even a horrendous sense of humor wont bring it down. Or, maybe the writing will improve, but that honestly seems much less likely as Dicetiny's identy seems pretty concrete. There's some real potential here and I'd hate to see it go to waste by the Dev's limiting their creativity and adhering only to existing ip's or out dated refrences."

Primarily it's a game of chance though some strategic application will improve your odds. As such I will primiraly being making comparision contrasts to help review this concept.One of my complaints is that in tweaking the Monopoly formula Dicetiny replaces purchasing property tiles with placing minions that can be defeated/removed/stolen and the result is a bit underwhelming. It removes the decisions between keeping resources or spending them in hopes of at least a small future or short term benefit but with the possibly of a huge payoff in the long run feel. That very decisions is what makes Monoploy somewhat interesting.  I say somewhat interseting concept because while the decisions set in front of you will change based on the dice roll/RNG/Random element of a particular game of Monopoly the overall strategy of each game is essentially the same (focusing on purchasing properties in a few key areas and not in others). I believe this is a result of having a fixed ""permenant"" gameboard that the elements are subject to is partially (maybe entirely?) to blame here and Dicetiny forgoes that particular dilema with the ability to randomize the board to  and the last half of each game tends to be a long jog to an inevitable conclusion.So in short form for this Monopoly variation the non-permenancy (totally a word I'm sure) spin on purchasing obstacles (properites in Monopoly and Units or Minions in Dicetiny) seems to accomplish the task of making the game less vanilla. Unfortunately it also waters down the spend/invest decision that makes Monopoly anything more than a game of pure chance. It's an intersting problem to face and I will be intersted to see what this group comes up with.Stay Tuned....Good Start!.....but its basically a demo at the moment sooooooooo.....hold off on purchase until they add some of that content stuff.At the moment you can play 4 scenarios on one difficulty setting and choose between four decks with some very light customization options to mix up the cards.NO LONGER CRASHING ON STARTUP per update."

So because of this, as I write this review, it's very unfinished.  There's currently only one 'zone' that you can play on.  But what I see is a great start.The basic premise is a board game mixed with a card game.  The best way I can describe it is if you took Blizzard's hearthstone card game and combined it with a board game.  You play your minions on the board and travel around the board in opposing directions from your enemy.  When you land on a square you encounter any minions or effects on that square, be they good or bad.I look forwards to future updates."

Your max deck size is 15 and you can have 2 of each card in your deck.Your opponents have a wider variety of cards than you but you never get to use them.Also you can aquire different cards from the store during the match but they cant be a part of your core deck when creating a deck.The goal is to get your opponents health to 0.Each player can purchase a draw on each turn provided they have the gold and use these cards to summon monsters, buff your character/monsters or cast a variety of spells using AP which rises by 1 per turn until a max of 7. AP is also used to use hero abilities, each hero has 2 unique abilities.The way the turns are set up is alot like monopoly, you roll dice and can land on;monsters (chose to fight or hire them to work for you),community chest type spaces,a dungeon (beat the monster and add it too your hand),a store to buy a card where you can buy a card to add to your handand another square where you can buy upgrades for your heros statsalso after each lap you gain 100 gold and you get 50 gold for each monster you kill along the way.So in conclusion this is a great game but considering how much content is currently available, this is little more than a demo at this point. I have heard rumors that on full release, this will be a $20 game and honestly if the rest is as good as this, its easily worth the price, assuming they fix some minor bugsI reccomend it, even if you just let it sit in you library until more content comes out."

It's currently early access, and by early access I mean it's brand freaking new. There's not much to do yet but even so, it's a lot of fun and has so much potential I'm confident it will turn into something great.So far you've got a total of 5 playable characters, and 4 scenario battles you can play. You essentially play a hearthstone style minion game with cards and AP, while also using gold to buy resources (and sometimes use abilities) while you move around a twenty space board.It is early access and as such has some glitches and issues, but I can definately see this becoming a great pvp game in the future."

There's quite a few of these little dice and card games available, but none of them that I have played are nearly as much fun and as well designed as this game.This game is just early in development when it launched today on October 22, 2015, but it already plays and runs like a finished game with lots of pizazz and glimmer.  This game is as cleverly designed as it's own name of the game is.. ""Dicetiny.. Destiny"" - get it? Hehe.Okay, imagine a board game where you roll dice to move in the opposite direction around the board as your AI opponent, each of you having a goal to knock or see your opponet's health drop to or below 0 health points.  So you take turns rolling the dice to move around, getting more powerful and aquiring more gold every time you pass your starting square on the board (Think Monopoly passing Go rewards).  In the special locations on the board you might land on the temple where you can spend your gold for very nice attack bonuses, health boosts, or action point increases!  Other corners you might land on with your dice roll could be a hand store to buy a very special card to hold in your hand, or a dungeon where you battle an increasingly more difficult monster each time it's defeated, but each also rewarind the winner with more rewards.  There are also trapped locations or occupied spots where you must either fight or hire random creatures to aid you in taking out your opponent.  This game offers a great balance of strategy with all of the choices you make, the gold you spend, when to spend it and what to spend it on, as well as luck with dice rolls and the timing of cards drawn etc.  Think RPG, Magic the gathering, and Monopoly all mixed into a perfect combination with a nice touch of humor and unique artistic style.To be honest, this is a brilliant little game that offers a HUGE bang for your dollar.  You can build your decks, customize your decks, choose and win different cards and heroes, and play a game that will vary so much that each game will ever be the same as the one before.My score even this early in it's development is a very solid and impressive 87%.  Watch my video to get a better understanding of why and how I came up with my score... or better yet just buy this game now and thank me later!  :-)"
