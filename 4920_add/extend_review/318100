The movement is clunky as hell, the camera movement and headbobbing makes it almost impossible to see anything.The dev ripped some of the weapon sounds just out of BF3 (not even joking here).Also there are no actual MOBA elements in the game. The developer just doesn't know what a MOBA actually is.Don't buy this game, it's a waste."

This is exactly why users look at Early Access, and write it off immediately.The game is not even in an alpha state in my opinion. No menu tips, no descriptions of what to do in game. It does not teach you anything. Which in a game that indicates ""MOBA, WARGAME, FPS"", is pretty god dang important. You get thrown in there. Graphics are meh. Sound is missing key portions of it. Hit detection is problematic, with feedback when YOU get hit, but not feedback when the enemy gets hit.One map is avaliable. Apparently, you're supposed to destroy lines. What are those lines? Unsure, just blow stuff up. Running around the map made me feel physically sick. Can't change resolution without the game freaking out. No windowed mode?the developer says: ""Now, game is completely ready as a multiplayer shooter with the MOBA elements"". That is a joke. It's by no means ready on any sort of level. And if they believe that, Then don't buy the game: it's obvious the quality will be complete♥♥♥♥♥♥More at a Youtube video here, but note this is a dive into gameplay, and me being angry about this game:http://youtu.be/80pt7ENcFGE"

All of the haters out there say that this was made in 20 or less minutes. But If they knew how hard it is to make a game then they would understand the pressure of making games and then see how this game is a really good game. Plus all th thumbs up reviews on how the unistall button work or happy to unistall are just stupid. I feel this is a great game and more people should play it. Even though how great the game works, there are still bugs or things missing. an example would be the running animation."

I'm keeping it in my library in case this becomes playable in 2 years, but for now, this is ridiculous. There is no content whatsoever. It needs the movement to be fixed, texture seams in some places. Actual gamemodes.  Actual text instead of silly symbols, an explanation as to how everything works, but then again, there's nothing to explain if there's nothing to do. I suggest first fixing the movement to no longer be choppy. Then start adding gamemodes and maps with an explanation about it. After that I suggest improving the GUI if you wanna get rid of the middle school computer project feeling. I hope the developer(s) is willing to put in a lot of effort, because this shouldn't even be considered ""alpha stage""."

76561198112937591,Not Recommended,318100,28811751,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,micho_z,"This game is a pure example of what is wrong in the ""Steam Greenlight"" independent game industry. And mostly, what kind of trivial mistakes, the dervelopers, are doing in the process of developing an ""indie game"".First, about this ""game"". It's suppose to be a MOBA type FPS but the ""game"" is in this stage practically from the beginning with no actual or visable updates. The only visable change was the changing of the name of this ""game"" from RiP to AXYOS. Yes, I know that the ""game"" is in ""Early Access"" but it's not, even, in an Alpha stage. I keep saying ""game"" with quotation marks because there is no game at all. Yes, the ""game"" looks like in the screen shots but that's it. Only nice characters models, some weapons and some textures made with the UnReal DevKit. And that's it!No gameplay at all. There are 3 maps, one of them is in two variations : day and night. The layout of the maps is flat. And I mean really flat - very basic path layout.  There are some weapons but with no notisable difference, like damage or reload time, between them. There are some items/buffs and the idea of item/buff usage. But with no meaning how to be implemented into the gameplay. There is some basic AI maybe from the DevKit. These models just sits there with no connection and meaning between them. No backstory, also. Nothing, except the basic idea that this suppose to be a MOBA type FPS and you must to shoot people. There are achievements. But most of them are broken maybe because of the lack of gameplay or some other reason, I don't know, and can't be obtained. There are only 2 servers, the last time I checked but there is an ""option"" to create your own servers. Looks like ""Make your own game"" starter pack.Now, about the mistakes. The dervelopers are making some of the most trivial and basic mistakes that I'm wondering if they have the abilities to start any kind of business. Obviously, they don't have a clear assessment about their abilities and concept. Can they handle the development of a FPS multiplayer game? But the most biggest mistake is the misunderstanding of the Steam ""Easly Access"". The main idea behind ""Easly Access"" is to cut the cost and time of Beta testing and the feedback to Q&A for bug and glitch removing. Not to funding your game like the dervelopers are doing with this one. Several times in the game's forums the developers are saying that they are using the money from the sells to fund the development, maybe that's why we have a DLC on not completed game, here. But if this is thue why the game is always on huge discounts( above 70%) on sales. And there is another thing. The dervelopers said, again, several times in the game's forums that they are temporary stopping the devopment of this game and changing to other project called ""Neon Arena"". And if the game is successful they will continue the development of their previous game. But again we got a surprise. We have not just one game but two games in a few months ""Crispy Chicken"" and ""Neon Arena"" which are actually one game just reskinned. This is a very suspicious behaviour: If we don't support the new game we will never get the old one!?  Another ""misleading tactics"" from the dervelopers side is the existence of achievements and Steam Trading Cards. I already said about the broken achievements but I must to mention that they are getting a fee for every traded card.  And to not forget to mention that the Col. Jack O'Neill SG-1 in his review is describing a problem with acrivation keys for this game. Here's thelinkNow, that kind of ""business practices"" shows not just misunderstanding of the Steam ""Easly Access"" or any basic business rules. But a very suspicious behaviour similar to the infamous ""Digital Homicide"".This is a Early Access review and I may change it if I see any futute development. Until then, I highly recommend to everyone to stay away and don't buy this game, not even on high -90% or above sales. I bought it on sale with -78% discound and I regret of giving my 1,24EU to it. This ""game"" don't deserve to be accepted even as a gift."

From whom is the 3rd party getting these keys, from the other dimension?Also the dev/s deleted a topic in forum, where people were discussing about that problem and the tone of asking me why i didn't activate the key already as i bought the bundle and where i bought it, was not really friendly.Yep, nice customer support."

Aim is shait, movement is worse and the best part in this game is making bets with yourself when it will crash.

I played this while it was in early access and I have to say, this is a great game, especially if it's on sale. I purchased it for 79 cents in early access and really enjoyed playing it. The only things I would like the developers to do with this game are to add a ranked playing option, some different maps and game modes and a training / tutorial option. When I first opened the game, the only way to practise was to jump into an online match, where I get wrecked by people who have played about 100 hours of the game. So overall, I would recomend this game, but wait until it's full release unless you're really eager to give it a go."

I am not trying to rip on it to hard (no pun intended)The game has seemed to progress since I purchased it which is good to see, however I feel one thing they are missing is the core fundamentals of the game. The UI is very uninformative. Back when it was called rip there was practically no UI at all. There is no explination of what the point of the games are. And so far my experiance has been running around in what appears to be a team deathmatch sort of deal. Ive also noticed there is no chat at this moment text nor voice.The mouse controls are very awkward. I have an 800 DPI mouse on a 1920x1080 screen and there doesn't seem to be much modulation. Its either way to fast or way to slow. I do have to say the assets and graphics are pretty stunning for a game of this budget. The actual physics of the gun play are a bit odd. Sort of like CS, battlefield and COD combined like an all season tire. Jack of all trades master of none.Bottom line verdict. Don't pick this up if your expecting COD or a AAA title and are going to complain about the 1 dollar you spent. Pick this up on sale for a buck and see where it goes. Expect nothing and hope for the best. This game is very young and is in the alpha stage without much funding so again you have to be patient with some errors.

When you are fighting another team, but have sun affects on your side making it harder for you to see them. Compared to them having no god lights affecting them. Probably a balancing issue. Maybe se the sun to the side of the map? Instead of behind the enemy team. Other than that it is was you expect. Not the worst game out there but not the best.The concept is a great idea but the hit registry doesn't seem to be great. Polishing needs to be done big time.

I dont know how many times I spawned to be killed instantlyAiming is weird and framerates drop at times and casued me to die because I was helpless.Maps could be a little bigger but for 3v3 I think the current size works.I think this is a promising Early Access game, if more people played it more often it would help speed along development I am sure.

The game has an ok concept however it's currently lacking content and suffers from a number of other issues. There is currently nothing to stop one team from spawn camping another except a temporary invisibility when you spawn (yes I mean invisibility as in you are hard to see but can can still take damage the instant you spawn) this can be abused however some players who are good can still slip out of their spawn, even when it's being camped, especially on night maps with fog. There is an attribute system which you can raise health and armor as well as accuracy, invisibility duration, and chain power which can increase stats when you stand close to teamates. Spawn camping can snowball even harder if the other team can out level you and outnumber you. There are only 2 pistols and 7 guns which is a bit lacking for a game with a full price of $7.99 but there is an account level system which is also a pain since people who might play this a lot have the upper hand with the rpg and sniper rifles. The graphics are also dated and some guns can be fired faster than their animation like the pistol which you can clearly see desync because you can fire it twice as fast as it's slow recoil animation. I wouldn't reccomend this game unless it's on sale for less than a dollar but you might want to try it then."

76561198081203123,Recommended,318100,17290827,"Posted: 29 July, 2015",all,lowblockade,"I feel this game is a cross between the shooting and the shop slection of Counter Strike and the source engine of Battlefield or Arma. However, i can tell where this game is going with its MOBA FPS gameplay with its special abilities like tempory armor, stimulated healing, Slow-mo bullet time, and even the ability to push and pull objects and players. Currently, the shop contains: Primary weapons, secondary weapons, explosives, and two slots for abilities and so far i can tell that they will add armor including helmets, body armor, gloves that will increase stats and what looks like to be equipment.Of course the game has bugs, what else do you expect from a Pre-Alfa game, but that does not take away its playability. I play PC games with a laptop not made for gameing having only 4 gb of RAM, but i am still able to play this game with my friends on its lowest settings with slight lag. Just from the menu screen you can tell its a Early Access Game, but once youre in a sever you can feel the decitation and the hard work put into it. Things that i have found playing this game that could use work is:-The players movement so it doesnt look the people are swimming (Which i actually find amusing while trying to shoot mermaids) and also the couch machanic so you dont bounce up and down a bit before settling down.-A more user friendly menu screen (eventhough i've found my way around already).-A better hub to make health and ammo easier to observe.Honestly, these bugs and improvements dont bother me a bit as they are now, but these fixes will help to make a complete and finished game. Some might wonder why im not complaing that there are not enough items in the shop or that the stats of the guns are unbalanced, well that's because if didn't, it wouldnt be a Early Access Game!I bought a four pack of this game to share with my friends and we have enjoyed every bit of it and are convinced that this game has what it takes to hit it big. Im happy that i can support this game and follow it as it the community grows and a new genre is prefected. 10/10"
,Not Recommended,318100,29021444,Posted: 4 January,all,bunnygum,"Its not a bad game to be honost, This is of course a review from when the game was on sale for $0.87.  The shooting is fine, the US server is ok but the problem is probably the players.  Theres not many and they are not that good.  In my second game it seemed too easy.The game is just basically another one of them fps games in small maps were you just have to capture an objective and try to hold it.  The maps as i said are tiny and some unplayable due to people of better skill being able to literally shoot from just infront of their spawn to the enemy spawn.  The game has invisability so then you cant do that but the invisability is the same quality of that as the killer in the hidden and can eaisly be seen.  To get the faster killing and longer ranged guns you need to level up which is like a moba BUT they messed it up and you dont level up through out the round but you level up your character in a more FPS style way which ruins the moba because others arent able to have the same things leaving it unbalanced which is BAD and is not a good way to implement moba style gameplay.Overall this game needs work and allot more thought from the devs.  At its current state it is playable but there is only ever 2 servers which are the official US and EU.  Theres not many players and there is not many players.  This is not worth the full price and i am worried for the devs because they over priced the game and if it hasent allready it is going to die soon.  For this i am not reccomending it because of these.Also if the game is not on sale for under $1.30 CDN then it is not worth buying.  Remember though you can refund if you are under 2 hours and in the time from of 2 weeks after purchase, so if you feel like trying it out, you can but in its current state it is playable but not the best."

In this case thats definitely not true. You get less than what you pay for. With only 5v5 matches and finding a match is tough, this game gave me literal cancer. However it does have some positives.-It's so cheap you might as well pay for it. However you'll regret dropping the $.49 if you buy just a single copy. Trust me-If you want a reason to play battlefield and call of duty this is the reason. The spawns, sensitivity, and just general gameplay are just so bad that you might as well just cough up the money for one of those titles and save yourself the heartache.-I guess that last one wasn't a positive.

This game is really well done for being in alpha, I'm not sure what will follow in its development but I can say as of now it has good graphics, the combat feels good nice amount of recoil (so it isnt as simple as point and hold to handle enemies at a range), you earn $ per kill to spend on weapons items and perks for only the duration of the match (which is great for not having a newb get completely overwhelmed). It does have some negatives though. At this stage there are very few maps and theyre very small which i dont see as positive but that depends on the player, and the spawns are static (non-mobile) which makes it easy to get spawn trapped with little chance of escape if more than 1 or 2 enemies are watching it. All in all I would say its completely worth its current price of $5 and I can't wait to see what comes later in development."

I play COD, and such and this does not give that feel, the controls are smooth like Unreal Tournament, Their should be more guns, should be able to map my controller but can not yet. I think if this game gets released this year it will be to early as it could use some ummph and could see profits if coded properly. I have recently been playing online, just started to find some other players and is getting interesting.

The developers stopped supporting this game SEVERAL years ago.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. NO MAYTER HOW CHEAP IT IS.Also: The developers have made a couple more games, even after choosing to stop development on this one. DO NOT give them the benefit of the doubt. They are making $ off of idiocy."
