The jokes may be funny at first, but they also rapidly become boring. The map design is pretty good (world map excluded), but I found the fights to be extremely repetitive. Combat variety is also very scarce. The soundtrack is ok, but the game itself uses a ton of premade RPG Maker graphics along with the beautiful custom resources, and that gives the game a ""lazy"" look on some parts. Part of it is by design, since this game wants(?) to be a parody of the JRPG genre, but I can't help but suspect that it was also to reduce the amount of work a lot and... well, it honestly feels very rough on the edges, despite its good qualities.After almost 7 hours of playtime, I don't think I'll play this game again any time soon. As I said, it gets boring fast. Imo, of course."
,Not Recommended,318130,19411682,"Posted: 1 December, 2015",all,ThunderMcBuffHuge,"Confirmed:This game is free on the Android and Windows app stores.Old review:The developer must usually work on mobile games because he annoyingly spams you to review his game, which is still surprising, because games that do that are usuallyfree. He also must be immature/petty because he tells you, ""you suck. >:("" when you try to back out of the chat with the spammer NPC that appears to be in every town.Since the developer wants to act like this is a freemium game, I'll correct his oversight in charging me money by utilizing Steam's wonderful refund policy. Here's your review that you wanted so badly, developer:I'd compare the writing to Big Bang Theory, which I tolerated. The combat is shallow. Graphics/sound/music are what you'd expect from a 16 bit game. I didn't notice any major bugs.If he ever takes out the NPCs (I talked to two in the first 30 minutes) fishing for positive reviews, and it's on sale for $2 or less, I'd recommend this game to people that watch Big Bang Theory specifically for the humor. Until then, I find this gameunplayable."
,Not Recommended,318130,32883926,Posted: 27 June,all,Cerzel,"Any game reliant on its humour to carry it needs a good script to deliver that humour, and this doesn't have one. The script is constantly awkward to read and has regular errors (such as in the store screenshot of ""How DARE you talking like that about my mother!"") that lead me to believe that this is an ESL translation. The parts of the script that aren't awkward on a technical level are typically just outdated pop culture references, that were already long outdated by the 2011 release date (Chuck Norris? Really?).The gameplay itself is nothing remarkable, and the menu design in particular is pretty horrible, with no proper equip menu and instead items are just equipped from the inventory, which becomes unwieldy quite quickly.You want to know the real reason this game is so highly rated? It's because every town has an NPC in it that begs you to give the game a positive review and opens the store page for you. I'm sure most people submitted these short and hollow positive reviews in the hope of getting a reward out of it."

I don't think I've ever laughed and groaned so much in any of these types of games before. It really draws you in with the excellent writing.I know that's a lot of excellents, but that's pretty much the best way to describe this game. It's definitely a worthy addition to any turn-based JRPG fan's library, and am very happy to hear that there is a sequel in the works, because this game and its characters definitely deserve one.Cancel that, it's not just a worthy addition to any JRPG library, it's a must have."

76561198051242041,Recommended,318130,17163900,"Posted: 21 July, 2015",all,Donoknight,"Man, I really don't know where to begin with this review... But here we go.Doom & Destiny is a turn based RPG that basically jokes about/steriotypes Tabletop RPGs as well as the ""nerdy/geeky"" lifestyle in a sense. It is very humorous, almost everything about this game will make you laugh if you understand it.So here is a short list of pros and cons to this game.Pros-Graphics, this is a ""if you like these kind of graphics"" thing. Personally, the graphics are nice, bringing back memories of some of the classic pixelly RPGs of old.Audio/Music, the music and audio are nice. Not really sure how else I should explain this... So there you go :-)Combat, the combat is turn based, which I definitely like. Skills/Powers and there uses actually matter, the proper timing of a skill could really determine whether you end the battle in victory or in defeat. Strategy actually matters!Skills/Powers, there are a lot of them! Plus, you get to choose basically any of them you want! In the game, you basically purchase your skills and give them to the characters, each character being able to equip a certain number of skills.Character Development, you are basically able to shape the characters however you want. Although the characters have a class that they are given initially, the terms of what these will become is vary vague, and up to your personal interpretation. Want a Ranger? Make one. Want a Paladin? Make one. Want Kirito from SAO? Make him!Alright, that is enough pros I think except from some more minor things, so lets continue with the cons.Cons-If you don't like ""RPG Maker Games"" or their like, then you probably won't like this one either. But let me just say, this is not your ""cheap made RPG maker game"", this is a milestone for games like this and it should not even be remotely compared to some of the other RPG maker titles currently on Steam.Combat, but didn't I have combat in pros? Well, I like the combat, but it seems like others do not like it so much. Like some turn based games, the combat may feel slow at points or feel repetative. This leads to the next point...Grinding, expect to grind some if you want to level your characters. Although for the most part you can just do quests and keep the action moving, you will need to do some actual leveling in order to proceed. Personally I have nothing wrong with experience hunting, but I understand that others do not like this so much usually, so I thought I would point this out.Conclusion-Doom & Destiny is definitely a game that is worth the money, if not for the gameplay (which itself is amazing), then for the comical aspect of it. It is definitely a unique game like nothing else I have seen previous. You should definitely get this if you want to play a fun, casual game with lots of humor.May your adventures be many and always end in reward!-Donoknight, Founder of the Tabletop RPG Gamers League"

It's really a lot of fun to find out every single reference!As someone said, this little pearl can often be neglected or ignored, being it an indie JRPG and we all of course have played hundreds of JRPGs from the 8/16-bit era until nowadays, but this game has way more depth than one may expect. It's really great on any field: nothing is left to chance, everything is studied and has its own right place in the game's own world.It's something that has been worked on for much time, and it's so enjoyable even for someone like me who has started playing JRPGs with imported cartridges for the SNES back in the '90s..Get this game, at any cost!! :P"

The story is the best part of the game.Combat is decent, and plenty of challanging battles, but I got tired of it while grinding levels for gold and levels to be able to handle the big bosses.If you don't like grinding, don't go for 100% achievements, it takes hours of just killing to get the gold you need, and without a guide, forever to find everything after you beat the game."
,Recommended,318130,33109254,Posted: 1 July,all,EsperothVIII,"This game has more depth than it at first seems to have.  It's one of those great little hidden gems that no one seems to know about.  The main game maybe has 8-12 hours of gameplay but if you go after the sidequests and hidden areas there is so much more to this game and the little secrets really make it worth it and extend the playtime considerably.It's one of the few games that made me dedicate to getting 100% acievements, which was difficult at times since there aren't any 100% guides out there and took a lot of wiki hunting.  Still very worth it.  Buy it, especially if it's on sale."

I am currently trying to complete the game, so I have not played through all the levels, but that does not really matter.

You're free to steal from homes because the king said so in an edict, npcs take their job of walking around aimlessly seriously, characters and npcs quote songs when using certain spells and, when questioned about it, some bosses might realize their plan of kidnapping the princess isn't as smart as it sounds: it's truly a ton of fun and I found myself chuclking at it quite often.But make no mistake, behind its jokes and references the game is a solid rpg in itself with a good story, a nice power system that lets you tailor the four protagonists to your liking and a big world with lots of stuff to do. Doom & Destiny is absolutely recommended to fans of the genre."

So the Warrior can decide to go ""Paladin"" by taking magical damage attacks (Smite Evil, Fire Sword,...), the Ninja can decide to go ""Monk"" by taking fist attacks (Stunning Fist, Fist of the South Star,...) and so on. This allows for a bit of replayability if someone wants to try different builds.The story (which is very good IMHO) isn't really hard to finish, but after the end you get the choice to keep playing for some late game challenges. This last part is a bit grindy (you need a lot of gold to buy the ultimate equipment and powers) but it's still still enjoyable. And you get to fight the Flying Spaghetti Monster.The authors of this game are italians, so italian players might get one joke or two more than the others (loved the Rat-Man reference :D )Buy it."

If you're looking for the polish and maturity that comes with a AAA studio, you won't find it here. If you're looking for light-hearted gamer humor in a JRPG package, this one is worth a look. Combat is what you would expect of a classic JRPG. Level design felt fairly well balanced, and grinding was not punishing imho. The art was again fun and lighthearted for those of us that have a nostalgia for the 80s. Granted I don't always ding an RPGM game for using stock graphics, so if that's a deal breaker you may find some disappointment in this respect as some of the graphics are stock.In short, if you see this on a special, it's well worth the investment!"

I love the old FF games and I like nerd humor so I loved it (that's why I played it for most than 50 hours). The only thing I might wish was different is that when the game becomes completely open ended with tons of side quests, the game loses a bit of humor and story and really just focuses on getting gear and powers."

So the Warrior can decide to go ""Paladin"" by taking magical damage attacks (Smite Evil, Fire Sword,...), the Ninja can decide to go ""Monk"" by taking fist attacks (Stunning Fist, Fist of the South Star,...) and so on. This allows for a bit of replayability if someone wants to try different builds.The story (which is very good IMHO) isn't really hard to finish, but after the end you get the choice to keep playing for some late game challenges. This last part is a bit grindy (you need a lot of gold to buy the ultimate equipment and powers) but it's still still enjoyable. And you get to fight the Flying Spaghetti Monster.The authors of this game are italians, so italian players might get one joke or two more than the others (loved the Rat-Man reference :D )Buy it."
